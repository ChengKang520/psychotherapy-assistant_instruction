SHENEZA MOHAMMED But you came out of it questioning yourself and questioning your own beliefs. 

00:00:05
JONATHAN FINKELSTEIN The ideas to share. 

00:00:05
HOBART PRICE I could leave here and look at people in a new light. 

00:00:10
EUNICE KIM Even if it doesn't make, uhm, a great difference in society, at least we know we shared a little bit about ourselves with each other. 

00:00:20
ETHNIC SHARING VALUING DIVERSITY Recently twenty-two high school students took part in a workshop to explore their ethnic and racial identities. Over the last decade this method of ETHNIC SHARING has been successfully conducted in hundreds of schools across the United States. This methodology was developed by Irving M. Levine and Joe Giordano at the Institute for American Pluralism. It is based on twenty-five years of research on the psychology of ethnic identity. ETHNIC SHARING is part of a comprehensive model which involves teachers, students and sometimes parents in a program that nurtures and values diversity. IRVING M. LEVINE 

00:00:20
IRVING M. LEVINE Today we're going to, ah, run you through a few exercises, ah, We're going, get you in, involved in what we call an ethnic sharing exercise and I think you're gonna have a great deal of fun. And here's my colleague, Joe Giordano, and he'll start as well. 

00:01:20
JOE GIORDANO 

00:01:20
JOE GIORDANO Okay. My name is Joe Giordano and, ah, I'm an Italian-American born in a place called, ah, Brooklyn. Ah, in an Italian ghetto. Ah, my grandfather and grandmother came from Italy at the turn of the century. Ah, they met there and got married. And in fact the story told with my family oftentimes is, when grandpa came, ah, to the United States, he didn't understand English, ah, but he picked up a newspaper and, ah, quickly(ph) he was looking through it, and ah, he saw a cartoon, and the cartoon was of an Italian-looking character who was, had an organ grinder and a monkey, ah, and a moustache. And a, he was standing, this character, behind a brick wall and he had a dagger in his hand, a knife, and out there were Americans, ah, and of course the implications while he didn't understand English, he understood the cartoon. It said Italians are not wanted. I am also a writer. I, I wrote a book called the Italian-American Catalog, kinda fun book and, ah, I sent it to publishers, but I got one letter. Joe Giordano's Italian-American Catalog book is, is a great idea, but we're not gonna publish it because, let's face it, Italians don't read and they don't buy books. (whistles) Wow, you know what my feeling was? I wanna go and punch him in the nose. And you know what? The first thought that came into my mind was grandpa. I thought of my grandfather and I thought the sting of that message of not being wanted and welcomed in this country was still alive after three generations. That's a little about the insight to my story and what we'd like you to do is to tell us your name, tell us, uhm, your ethnic background, how you identify yourself. Tell us, ah, what it's like growing up in your family, what are the, what are the values, what are the ways of, uhm, what are the important values that are transmitted to you, ah, that, uhm, that you would say uniquely grow out of your heritage in your family. Ah, tell us what it's like being in the school, growing up in this community with your particular background. 

00:03:25
SHENEZA MOHAMMED 

00:03:25
SHENEZA MOHAMMED My name is Sheneza Mohammed. I'm, my parents are both from the Caribbean. They're from Guyana. They're both born and raised there. They came to the United States around 20, 22 years ago. I'm, I'm also an Islamic-American and a very close family plays, ah, a big part in my life. The fact that my parents were from the Caribbean, there's, uhm, there's a very big sense there of, you know, being able to enjoy life and having a good time living life. 

00:03:55
IRVING M. LEVINE There is no clash, ah, with being a Muslim, and having this kind of good time? It, it goes together? 

00:04:00
SHENEZA MOHAMMED  Well, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
IRVING M. LEVINE Because there maybe a stereotype of... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
SHENEZA MOHAMMED ...there is, ah, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
IRVING M. LEVINE ...in some of our minds that that ah, (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
SHENEZA MOHAMMED Yeah. 

00:04:05
IRVING M. LEVINE Muslims are restricted, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
SHENEZA MOHAMMED Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
IRVING M. LEVINE In their behavior. 

00:04:10
SHENEZA MOHAMMED I think yeah. There is, there is that conflict. There's a certain type of leeway in the American practice of their religion, uhm, especially now, in my family, that the way we, uhm, in practicing the religion, it's, it's to the point where, where, you know, the, the women is not considered sub, subservient. In my family, my mother is, is (laughs) definitely the dominant figure. She's the, she's the Wall Street executive so, you know, she, and, is, you know, so there is that, there's that change of roles. 

00:04:40
IRVING M. LEVINE You have ever had any, ah, acts of discrimination, ah, that, ah, ah, against you, because you were a Muslim? 

00:04:45
SHENEZA MOHAMMED  I had one incident in particular last summer where, uhm, I worked as an environmental canvasser of, uhm, and I was going door to door. This was during the height of the Gulf War. A man (laughs) answered the door and, uhm, I introduced myself. I said, "My, my name is Sheneza Mohammed." The minute he heard Mohammed, he started reeling about you, Iraqi, you Saddam lover, and, ah, ah, (laughs) you know, I stood there and I, I stared at him, "What, what are you talking about? (laughs) I'm as American as you are." And that got me very angry, uhm, and you know, he slammed the door on my face, and I, I continue to ring the door but just to annoy him, because, you know, you just got, I just got so angry at that point, and he threatened to call the police. I said, "All right. Call a police. Call the police. Do what you want." You know, that was like a, a heart, like, wrencher afterwards. But, you know, you have to deal with it. It's part of, it's part of being a minority, and then I'm not, I'm not just a minority. I mean, I'm a minority of a minority, uhm, and, ah, you know I'm a female too. 

00:05:50
JONATHAN FINKELSTEIN 

00:05:50
JONATHAN FINKELSTEIN My name is Jonathan Finkelstein, and I'm a blonde American Jew. My great-grandmother, uhm, who I call bubbe, 'coz that's the Yiddish word for, ah, for grandmother, she came over in, at the turn of the century, uhm, as a result, ah, she was trying to flee the pogroms that were going on there. Ah, her family, ah, her brothers were killed in the pogroms and, uhm, she told us lots of stories about how they, ah, they were actually, physically running from their houses as they're, as they were being burned and, and she was running barefoot. They attributed a lot of the, uhm, ah, persecution in, in Eastern Europe and Russia, uhm, to discrimination because the, the Jewish groups in, in Eastern Europe tended to be successful in, in, in businesses and, and whatnot. And when times got tough in, in Eastern Europe, they turn to those who had, who happened to have had the most in their small communities and, uhm, blame them for all their troubles. But when I think of, uhm, what it means to be Jewish, to me, I think of, ah, something very similar that, uhm, Mr. Giordano said about being an Italian-American. I think the two cultures are very similar. When my grandparents come over and my cousins come over, there's always lots of storytelling, I mean despite what goes on in other cultures. But I, I don't live in those houses, I live in a Jewish home, so I can tell you that when my grandmother comes over I, I bet a lot of grandmothers do this, but it's always the, you know, cheek-pinching and, uhm, "My, he's gotten tall" and, oh, I, you know, how did, you know, a lot about school. It wasn't like, uhm, pounded into me that I had to, had to, uhm, you know get A pluses, or I had to, but I, I think it, it, something about the environment was that it was expected that we would, we would, uhm, do the best we possibly could. I got to my senior year, I had my resume and I had my grades, and I had worked for them very hard, and a college adviser told me, when I applied to Harvard, that he said, "You have everything it takes to get into Harvard." He said, "And you'll know in a month what they finally decide, but if you don't get in, it's probably because you're a Jewish-American who lives on Long Island." So I think he said, "It wouldn't be anything against you." He said, "But it's, uhm, they want diversity." And... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
 How did that (inaudible )? 

00:08:10
JONATHAN FINKELSTEIN ...throughout that time I was saying to myself, I worked so hard. I've, I wanna go there and if, if, I mean I don't know if that's the reason, what their reason is, you don't know what, what they have in mind, but if that would, if that was the reason that, that I would be rejected, I would, it would, it, it would, it really bothered me that. 

00:08:25
IRVING M. LEVINE Good. Next panel member. 

00:08:25
ANDREA LoBIANCO 

00:08:25
ANDREA LOBIANCO My name is Andrea LoBianco. I'm a Hispanic-American. I'm, my family, my mother's side, is all from Ecuador, so I've considered myself Ecuadorian. My mother is the most important thing in my life, 'coz my mother, her sister, her mother, her, all her sisters, basically they brought the family together. They held the family together. They raised the children, and eventually when the men left, they were the ones who stuck together through everything. And my mother always tells me that "You're not gonna have anyone else in this world all the time except for your family, not your friends, not your colleagues, not anyone else, but your family." So I feel that deep down that is very important to me. And the second most important thing to me in my life is God. I'm very religious. I'm Roman Catholic. I went through all the ceremonies and everything and beliefs and schools and I feel that there is a God and I rely on him deeply for what happens in my life. And how I feel about other people I guess you could say it's from God because I don't think that I should be judging anyone of these people and I think people judge on the base of ignorance, on the base of lack of respect. My mother came here at 20 years old with nothing, as most people did, and she worked hard to have a family first and then she had a business. My mother is not a physicist. My mother is not a Wall Street executive. My mother is a business owner and it's very hard because my mother is Spanish and the way the people treat her is as below her because a lot of doctors come in the deli and I've thought of that, and they perceive my mother as being uneducated because she is running a deli which, you know, would not, perceived to be the most hardest thing. 

00:10:25
JOE GIORDANO That must be very, very difficult for you to observe, feeling as close and as proud and as good about your relationship with your mother. 

00:10:30
ANDREA LOBIANCO It, to, it used to upset me as in get me upset and sad that people could act this way, but now it just gets me mad that people... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
JOE GIORDANO Hmm. 

00:10:40
ANDREA LOBIANCO Still act this way after everything the country has been through and I think people still have prejudices. I, I don't understand because if everyone is going through all this hardship, why can't you relate to one another's hardships and make it better for everyone else? And if you can't, then that's the way it's gonna be and it doesn't look like it's working out for my situation, from the, still hearing everything over and over again and people not learning from anything. 

00:11:05
IRVING M. LEVINE Are you hopeful in the, ah, long run? That maybe through programs like ethnic sharing and other programs that are anti-bigotry and pro-intergroup relations that we're gonna get better understanding with each other eventually? 

00:11:20
ANDREA LOBIANCO I hope so. I'm doubtful, but I hope so. 

00:11:20
HOBART PRICE 

00:11:20
HOBART PRICE  I'm Hobart Price and I'm an African-American. I think that I'll be the fourth generation that will, that's college-bound and I think a lot of people don't, they look at, they, they look at Black people and they say, "You know, ah, I, I wonder if that kid's parents went to college? I wonder if he's gonna go to college?" And I think that's, that's a major stereotype that we're not as educated as the rest of the world and in fact that's probably what I'm the most proud of me. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
HOBART PRICE I mean, my dad had nothing. I mean, he had absolutely nothing and he worked his tail off and now he's a physician. And although my mother wasn't nearly as poor as he was, she, she, she worked just as hard and, you know, she's a teacher now and, I mean, to come from a professional family, it's just I feel, I feel a lot of pressure to perform, you know, to live up to expectations. But I think that's really the major thing about my family is that we're so educated and that we're, there's such high expectations for me, you know? 

00:12:25
IRVING M. LEVINE Hobart, your parents have a good education, it looks like you're getting a good education. Has that made you immune from racism and bigotry? 

00:12:35
HOBART PRICE Hhmm, yes and no. Ah, I've, I've been given the same treatment in some cases as someone who might not be from the same, and that might not be at the same social level, you know, economically. But if I walk into a store and there's store security, a store security guard is watching me constantly. He's following me around. 

00:13:00
JOE GIORDANO And the fact that you're a middle-class high achiever, do you get some flak sometimes? 

00:13:05
HOBART PRICE I get more flak as you said from African-Americans than I do from, from, from any other ethnic group in the school. I get the, the Oreo, I, I get the sell-out, I get this, I get that but I think what a lot of people... (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
IRVING M. LEVINE Would you explain that to us? 

00:13:20
HOBART PRICE  What it is, is people feel that if you're not, if you don't hang out, or you're not friends with a certain type of person, then you've lost all of where you came from and you don't remember where you came from and, and, ah, I feel, I'm hurt by that. 

00:13:40
EUNICE KIM 

00:13:40
EUNICE KIM My name is Eunice Kim and I'm a Korean-American female. The most obvious thing when you look at me is my color and my features. So you, so people on the street can just call out, you know, names as, you know, I think we've all heard, uhm, you. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
IRVING M. LEVINE What do they, what do they call out? You know, what have you heard? What is it that you've heard? 

00:14:00
EUNICE KIM Well the, the most, ah, frequently heard I guess would be chink and that is, like, such a hurtful term I can, I don't know, uhm, like, but the problem with being like, you keep saying like, this school is so diverse, this school is so di, so diverse, yes, it's diverse, unfortunately I don't think it's integrated. Uhm, I was in school, we were having a practice after school. I was, uhm, playing with the radio and a bunch of guys came over, you know, they wanted to play with it. And I was, you know, I please, politely asked them to leave. So then they started, you know, making fun of me, not, not ethnically but, you know, they were just going off of me, "Oh, come on, let's, let us play, whatever." And then the, the thing they can always fall back on, the last, like as a last resort, they could always make fun of my ethnic background and I would never, never say anything about, uhm, anyone else like that. Uhm. 

00:14:55
JOE GIORDANO  When they said, of all the things they said, that those things are always hurtful but was that more hurtful when they focused on your ethnic background, on your Korean background? 

00:15:10
EUNICE KIM Yeah, I think so. Uhm, I mean, ah, you know, like, like little things, everyone gets, put(ph) jokefully(ph) you call your friend a loser or something. I mean, you know everyone says that but I, the only time that stands out in my mind, the only things that really like stand out would be the times when, you know, you get called and, a racial slur. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
EUNICE KIM  So, uhm, and then like, if you try to get, uhm, you, uhm, get, if you it, like you associate, you try to integrate yourself with, like, other cultures then people like of your same culture, like Koreans will call the, like call me a Twinkie 'coz I'm Asian on the outside and then, but I'm really white on the inside. That's not true. I mean, that's... (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
 Hmm. 

00:16:00
EUNICE KIM It's, it's all ignore, ignorance. 

00:16:00
JOE GIORDANO You're, you're kind of expressing for many of us what the hurt is, not only personally because when those remarks are made against you, they're really made against your family and all that they struggled with. I certainly feel your, your hurt and I, ah, I thank you for sharing that with us. 

00:16:15
  Challenging and rewarding. 

00:16:20
EMILY GALLICE Enlightening and fun. 

00:16:25
JOSHUA C. KELLY Growth and understanding for all of those involved. 

00:16:25
Following this Ethnic Sharing session, teachers discussed their personal and professional experiences facilitating similar student and teacher workshops. EMILY GALLICE 

00:16:25
EMILY GALLICE  I've done two or three total. I've done one with teachers and one ses, two sessions with, uhm, students. And I was overwhelmed at how well, how eloquently they express themselves and still get emotionally involved and, and really, uhm, listen to each other and experience what each other was saying and, and understand it and think about it and I think the, the differences and the similarities were really, really interesting for them and for me. I, I was so impressed with all the kid. 

00:17:05
ELISA STEWART 

00:17:05
ELISA STEWART The only mistake that we made in any of our sessions was that some, at one point, people thought we were trying to force them to got, to categorize themselves when they were uncomfortable doing that. So, we had to preface our remarks by saying how do you identify yourself and however you identify yourself, it's perfectly alright and it's okay. And for some people it's a religion, for some people it's a race, for some people it's a language group like Hispanic, for some people it's nationality like Italian, but it, it doesn't have to be the same for everybody. And after we made that clear they were much more comfortable. 

00:17:45
IRVING M. LEVINE Good. That's important because there are some introductory language that you have to use, ah, what you've just said is exactly what, ah, we suggest that you do. There's another statement that we make and that is while there are group differences and there are group patterns, no one individual ever follows their group exactly, so don't stereotype. You can generalize, but don't stereotype. 

00:18:10
PATRICIA BELIKIS 

00:18:10
PATRICIA BELIKIS I've been a facilitator three times and, ah, one of the things I like about it is that, like teaching, you have to go with the flow. Not that you can't say, you start here, you say this, you ask this question, and it's gonna get a, because you got a feel of the group and you have to, if it go, it's going one way, you have to, you, you work it that way and it, it's really exciting to do. 

00:18:30
PATRICIA PONZI 

00:18:30
PATRICIA PONZI Some of the things have gone on in those sessions are, are beautiful and, and having done it 12 to 13 times, I found, like Lisa has, that every time we've done it there has been something new and wonderful about it. I always went in with trepidation thinking it can't be as good as it was last time, it can't be as good and it was. It might have been different but it had equal depth to it and the, and the kids were wonderful. 

00:18:55
JOSHUA C. KELLY 

00:18:55
JOSHUA C. KELLY I believe that ethnic sharing is going to be important not only for the people of diverse, uhm, ethnic backgrounds but also, also people, uhm, finding out their own ethnicities as a, a right for them to have. 

00:19:05
 I think one of the big pluses about ethnic sharing is that it's a non-threatening program. You don't really have to be a trained psychologist or a guidance counselor to, to, ah, to run the program. As a matter of fact teachers are a natural, they're, uhm, masters at running a class, ah, controlling a classroom, handling a classroom, involving students in group discussions and they can, ah, with very little training and with a commitment to the, to, to the program, a teacher can, is a natural. A teacher can do it beautifully. 

00:19:35
LESLIE WECKSLER 

00:19:35
LESLIE WECKSLER All I can say is that I wish I had this program when I was in high school, uhm, I think it's incredibly beneficial to the student. 

00:19:40
MAY LEE 

00:19:40
MAY LEE On, on the, ah, personal level, it's to help everybody acknowledge a part of themselves that they might otherwise deny, repress, demean, belittle, and so forth. And on the, ah, international level, it helps to create a, ah, salad bowl that is digestible. 

00:19:55
LINDA KELLNER 

00:19:55
LINDA KELLNER  I think we as teachers came, all came in to this profession because we felt we had something to offer and I feel that the ethnic sharing program enhances everything that we have to offer the children. It teaches the children tolerance, respect, it teaches us respect and it, it helps us grow and learn. And if that's what we're going to need to gain in the society that we're in today, I think that's very essential.
