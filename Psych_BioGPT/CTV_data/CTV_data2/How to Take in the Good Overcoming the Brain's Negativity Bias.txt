RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, my name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome to Neuroscience in Action. So, we've had a lot of talk about brain science in this field over the last ten or fifteen years and this series, we're really investigating the degree to which that has been actually integrated into clinical practice. And our guest today is someone who, uh, has made some very interesting contributions and has in, in his own development as a therapist, I think, really has, uh, has, uh, blazed a path that is, may remind many of us of our own early infatuations with the vocabulary of brain science; the difference being that our guest today really has, uh, moved to, uh, a, a different level. He has some very brilliant and interesting things to say about how he is going to apply these ideas in his practice. So, let me introduce our guest today, Rick Hanson, author of ' Buddha's Brain'. How are you, sir? 

00:01:10
RICK HANSON Really good, Rich. It's always great to talk with you, truly. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON So, um, tell us a story here, uh, Rick. So, um, it, and this will remind many of us of our own infatuations with brain science, when did you begin to get interested in th-, this, uh, arcane vocabulary of brain science and the possibility that it might really make a difference in your practice? 

00:01:35
RICK HANSON Yeah, my, looking back on it, once upon a time, uh, I got interested in the brain, actually, in the mid-70s. I remember reading 'Machines Who Think', uh, one of the early, uh, explorations of artificial intelligence and how would you model neural structure. Actually, it was quoting Marvin Minsky, that someone recently from his great book, uh, 'Society of Mind' and I always think about Batson's model. Yeah, it was just the 60s, 70s. But I'm old school. 

00:02:00
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:02:00
RICK HANSON Yeah. The idea that the mind brain system being a, an ecosystem in a certain type of way, uh, in which different thought patterns have niches, like animals in the ecosystem have niches and so forth. So that was the background. The problem was, as you know, there wasn't much data. Uh, it was more blue sky possibility, but the fundamental idea that one could consider the causes of suffering in its end, broadly defined, in the mind and look at those causes as they manifest at a lower level of explanation. One that was, in a sense, more primary and in some ways, perhaps, more tractable because as we know as Freud said a while ago, psychotherapy is the impossible profession. Not really, but it's, kind of, difficult sometimes to get change going. So, the take-away for me, the exciting idea, was that since the brain is really the bottom line and certainly our moment-to-moment conscious experience, as well as its profoundly influential in terms of unconscious processing, as well as physical health, cause it's the master regulator of the body. If one had some understanding of how to intervene inside the black box, to actually get down in there, maybe I'm, that's cause I'm a guy I guess I think mechanistically and...(crosstalk) 

00:03:20
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:03:20
RICK HANSON ...simplistically. But there you have it. If we could figure out which levers to pull and which valves to turn off, we can really change things for the better. So that got me very interested and then, in the last I'd say ten years or so, coincident with the explosion of knowledge about the three pounds of tofu inside the coconut...(crosstalk) 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:03:40
RICK HANSON ...you know, I got, there was enough kno-, information that you could actually use it. And then I got really, really interested. And, as you know, uh, I have a background in contemplative practice, so I was very interested in modeling in the brain, the wisdom streams both from Western psychotherapy and clinical psychology broadly. And also these more, usually, Eastern streams of understanding of mental processes, particularly, both ones that lead to suffering and ones that lead to really beautiful, uh, states of mind in our upper reaches of human potential. The idea of modeling those too at the level of the brain and then based on that model, working backwards. How, reverse engineering, in other words, what's going on in the brain when people are in a really good place? And then, okay, how can we cultivate the causes of that state in the brain...(crosstalk)? 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON How can we teach people to enter into states of mind that have a, a that are positive, that, uh, generate a sense of oneness and relationship and connection, rather than fear and, and, uh, the st-, the negative, negativity bias that you've, uh, written about. So, in terms of the bridge here, between this, this very provocative literature that came in, in the 60s early into the 70s, first time maybe we, maybe that we can look inside a black box and we don't have to, we're not for, for, that's not forever or for closed to us. In a concrete way, how did you begin to formulate a way of moving just from using these term-, this terminology, uh, that so many of us have fallen in love with, give us a sense of authority, to, uh, actual clinical method? How do you begin to apply this, other than just labeling brain processes in your consulting group? 

00:05:25
RICK HANSON Right, it's, to me that's the really important question, uh, pragmatically. And, it's a little bit like a romance, uh, I fell in love with the brain. I had my infatuation phase, I wonder if, uh, we need something like Kuber Losses, Kubler Ross' stages of death and dying but more, uh, falling into and out of love. I'm sure somebody has done that for falling into and out of love. But anyway, and you're right, I began feeling that there was, uh, a fair amount, including, honestly, I was doing it too, of old wine packaged in, shiny, fancy, impressive, sell a lot of workshops and books bottles. And actually, it was just old wine and I think one of the liabilities in our own profession is how often we lose a sense of the historical and we reinvent, uh, things that were already well considered, uh, three, four, five decades ago and then we give them a new label and, I think, that's happened to some extent, in positive psychology. Uh, and it's really actually nothing new. So I, I went through my own disenchantment phase and the take-away from that, for me, which would be linked to what I said previously, is this idea that if you want to help its levels of explanation. In other words, if you want to help a client be less anxious or be less depressed, or be more able to control himself or herself in interactions with other people that are problematic, or to enter a deep, uh, unconditional happiness. Whatever you goals are, fundamentally that means changing brain structure. So, one way to think about what we do day-in-day-out as therapists, is that we're in the business of changing the brain. That's our job. People come to us for change. Uh, if, the change may be simply greater self-knowledge, or a very open and then existential exploration, but they come to us for and they pay us money, and they put up with a lot of grief, as it were, to get a result. That means that the brain has to change. Learning has to occur, broadly defined. There has to be a change in memory group systems, broadly-defined. And so that then becomes a focus. How do we build structure in the brains of our clients or how do help our clients change their structural, the structure of their brain? Which then, of course, takes us to the findings on neural plasticity experience-dependent neural plasticity; neurons that fire together, wire together, quote-unquote, etc. So in that brain, what happens fairly quickly if you start thinking about how the brain builds structure, is you become aware of the negativity bias; that the brain is evolved in terms of structure built. In other words, the bottom line is that the brain is very good at learning from bad experiences. But it's pretty bad at learning from good experiences, unless they're million dollar moments. So, there's a lot of evidence that shows that, um, neural processing generally is privileged for negative, uh, stimuli. Even if positive stimuli predominant in the world of an animal, or a primate, or a hominid, or a human today, uh, as soon as anything potentially bad happens, you know, you hear a funny sound, or you, you there's an ache in your body you're not used to, or you're in a crowded restaurant and you hear a voice raised in anger, uh, attention goes to that immediately. Or you're doing couple's counseling and you're watching, everything's going fine and then one of the people in the couple uses that word or has that look in his eyes and that's what the other person focuses on. 

00:09:00
RICH SIMON And that, of course, is because of, of, that our evolutionary bias towards av-, avoiding danger and threat, and a threat and so that we're, we are wired through eons, upon eons, upon eons not to smell the roses, but to, to fear the saber-toothed tiger, however that manifests. 

00:09:25
RICK HANSON Yeah, the, uh, it makes it quite concrete to realize that if you think of the difference between carrots and sticks, right? You need to get carrots to survive but if you don't get a carrot today, you'll probably have a chance to get one tomorrow; but if you fail to avoid a stick today, whap, no more carrots forever. So sticks are different from carrots in their urgency and impact, generally speaking. Yeah, and that, and that shows up well in terms of, um, the conversion or encoding of moment-to-moment experiences into underlying neural structure. Uh, the brain has dedicated systems that rapidly convert any negative experience into underlying neural structure. Uh, once burned, twice shy, never forget, as it were. But unless it's a million dollar moment, positive experiences use standard issue memory systems and as thousands of studies, really, on cognitive psychology show, uh, we have short-term memory buffers in long-term storage, okay? The negative experience in the short-term memory buffer, whoop, gets converted immediately to long-term storage. But the positive experience uses standard issue memory systems, which means something has to be held in the short-term buffers five, ten, twenty seconds in a row, typically with certain regeneration or repetition, so that it can gradually sift down into those long-term stores. Then how often do we actually do that with positive experiences? We tend to move onto the next positive experience or it's dislodged by a mild experience, a neutral experience, or even a negative one. The take-away point is that most positive experiences wash through the brain like water through a sieve, while negative ones are caught every time. That's why the brain is like velcro for the negative, but Teflon for the positive. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:11:15
RICK HANSON And the take-away for me as a therapist, when I started realizing this, it was very humbling and disturbing to appreciate that the vast majority of the useful, positive, often hard-won mental states, in other words, experiences that were activated and running in the mind of my client, that my client had worked hard to, to have or I'd helped my client. I'd worked hard for them to have. Bottom-line, they made no difference. They were pleasant in the moment, but from the standpoint of any kind of lasting change, they may as well not have happened at all. 

00:11:50
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:11:50
RICK HANSON They were wasted on the brain. The brain had not saved them in any, kind of, way. And that the recognition of this and the, um, bias of the brain in terms of learning toward the negative, has made me appreciate how vitally important is to take the extra 10 or 20 seconds to enable the brain to install in neural structure, therefore, lasting learning, that activated, useful, positive mental state. 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, this whole business of installing is a, this, this vocabulary that, uh, uh, and reactivating, and reactivating, and reinstalling seems like a real cornerstone of what you have developed over these last 10 or 15 years. So talk to us a little bit about your ideas about how does one install, uh, a, move from being a, a state to installing, uh, helping people to build a trait instead of just a passing moment into something that's a permanent addition to, a long-term addition at least, uh, to somebody's neural structure? 

00:13:00
RICK HANSON Yep.Yeah. This is where, I think, some very well-developed and robust, sort of, if you'll forgive the metaphor, weapons-grade ideas in psychology can really come in. In other words, it's learning theory. How do we help the brain learn? Now, we're talking here about emotional learning, slow learning, existential learning, the learning of, metaphorically speaking, at least, although physically as well, the learning of the heart, the learning of the body. And especially we're talking to make a distinction here, uh, between explicit and implicit memory. Uh, as people probably know, explicit memory, which has to do with learning, you know, changing of the brain involves recollections of events, as well as what's called semantic or declarative knowledge. What's two plus two? What's your middle name? Uh, who's president today? And so forth. Implicit memory includes procedural learning, how to rather than about and it also includes object relations paradigms, uh, attachment classifications, the lived residues, the emotional residues of lived experience slowly sifting down into us, our biases, our informations, our assumptions, our expectations. 

00:14:10
RICH SIMON Like, putting like 98% of life...(crosstalk) 

00:14:10
RICK HANSON Yeah, what really matters. 

00:14:15
RICH SIMON ...largely implicit, yeah. 

00:14:15
RICK HANSON You know, that's exactly right and so right there is a little bit of a take-away. Uh, in, in, to appreciate, as many therapies have done, but I think where brain science has added value is to highlight the importance of really appreciating the implicit, uh, memory and, um, the formation of implicit memory. So while I think that it's important for clients to have new explicit recollections and new declarative or semantic knowledge, that's just the tip of the iceberg. That's the tail of the dog, if you will. It's important, okay, but the dog is an implicit, uh, memory systems, okay. So then what supports the formation of useful implicit memory because that's where the inner resources are that we draw upon, the inner factors that people draw on. Like, for example, a positive mood or for example, um, the executive functions or character strengths; you know, Seligman's and Peterson's work on character strengths, for example. How did we get these inner resources built cause they reside almost entirely in the implicit memory? Well, that's where I was getting at this, kind of, robust, uh, knowledge based technology from, from learning is really useful and it is the language of to, to, that you use, which is states and traits. In other words, moment-to-moment, um, we're having this state, as it were, a state of mind. We're having an experience, we're hearing a sound, we're having a sensation, we're having an emotion, we're having a desire, from a perspective, okay; that's a momentary state. Most of those states flow through the brain without leaving any structural change or mark and that's okay. Otherwise it'd become saturated. 

00:15:55
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:15:55
RICK HANSON The question is, again, given this negativity bias, in which negative mental states quickly convert to negative neural traits, how do we help positive mental states really sink in? How do we install them in the brain so then later we can draw upon them and reactivate in the consciousness, use that and then reinstall them, gradually building up memory structures, you know, once given enough time, in a lovely positive cycle. How do we actually do that? 

00:16:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:16:25
RICK HANSON Okay, so I have a method. Now...(crosstalk) 

00:16:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:25
RICK HANSON I did not invent this method, I want to be very clear about that. It's implicit in a lot of, uh, therapeutic approaches, personal growth gen-, in general, human potential, as well, and also spiritual practice. But what I'm trying to do right now is to explicate it and then apply it clinically, uh...(crosstalk) 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:40
RICK HANSON ...for maximum benefit. The whole point is, life is made up of moments. What's a person's learning curve, you know? In other words, how much of the opportunity for lasting benefit are we capturing in this moment? So is our learning curve, kind of, shallow or steeper? I'm very interested in that delta, that x over y, you know, in this moment. Get more on the...(crosstalk) 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON The angle. 

00:17:05
RICK HANSON You know, yeah, I want to get that, okay. So, how to actually do that. This is where it's, people can find it, freely too, on my website and so forth. I call it 'Taking in the Good'. It's this basic idea, so it's three steps to really do it simply. How do you actually get something going? Step one, you have to activate, you have to have a positive experience in the first place. Now often you'll already be having one and, uh, you'll use it, okay. It's either in the foreground or in the background of awareness. People can do this right now. They can notice that right now in their experiencing are probably some positive elements, in the overall mosaic of this moment of experience; you know, a sense of interest perhaps, or relaxation of the body, or watching their mind work usefully, or a sense of connection with others, or some gratitude, fine. And people can also create a positive experience. There are lots of ways of doing that, just thinking about good facts in your life these days or in your past or potentially the future. A lot of positive psychology is a very well-developed technology or creating positive states of mind. And that's great. I got it activated, that's step one, all right? 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, right. 

00:18:15
RICK HANSON But, if we don't install it, it's wasted in terms of lasting benefit. So that then takes me to steps two and three in 'Taking in the Good'. 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:25
RICK HANSON Step two it to enrich the experience, to extend it, to make it last that critical mass of 5, 10, 20 seconds. There's, kind of, a threshold...(crosstalk) 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON Now where does that come from? Where does the idea of 10, 5, 10, what is 20 seconds, uh, what, what's, where's the, what's the background for that idea? 

00:18:45
RICK HANSON Yeah, that, my notion of this comes loosely from learning theory, in that, if you wanna help people learn new information, uh, there is a threshold effect. In other words, if you don't hold it in short-term buffers, passed a, kind of, threshold, which depends on the material and the person, but it's around 5 to 10 seconds, it's gone. We've all had that experience. We're trying to remember a phone number...(crosstalk) 

00:19:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:19:05
RICK HANSON ...uh, or a license plate, if we can just keep it going and refresh it, roughly 5, 10 seconds, it sinks in. But we all know that if someone interrupts us or starts messing with our mind, throwing new numbers at us or whatever, poof, it's like a bubble, it's gone. 

00:19:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:25
RICK HANSON So, interestingly, there's a lot of research on how activated negative mental states become installed negative traits. There's very little research on how activating positive mental states, it's interesting, isn't it, become ac-, become installed positive mental traits. So I'm just trying to, uh, I'm not trying to over-claim here; I'm just trying to think plausibly about what...(crosstalk) 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:19:45
RICK HANSON ...can make a difference...(crosstalk) 

00:19:45
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:19:45
RICK HANSON If nothing else, the more the better, you know, even if it's, even if it's not, uh, even if it's a linear progression, there is a dosing effect, we all think we'd accept that. I have a hunch that there's a qualitative increase if you get passed this critical mass, sort of, threshold of around 5 or 10 seconds in a row. 

00:20:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:20:05
RICK HANSON That's where that comes from. 

00:20:05
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:20:05
RICK HANSON So you wanna, so to enrich the experience in the second step, extend it in time, make it last as long as possible, have it be as embodied as possible so you really experience it; you're feeling the sensations, you're really having the emotions, you're letting them fill you, um, you're giving yourself over to it for 10 seconds privately, no one needs to know why you've got that goofy grin on your face. Or even if it's a poker face, uh, but internally you're, you're, you're embodying that. Third, you're helping it be as intense as possible. And then fourth, to the extent that you can, uh, you focus on novelty. You keep, in a sense, observing different aspects that are fresh or new in the experience so it doesn't become stale. And fifth, in terms of well-known factors for increasing learning, uh, you try to see the personal relevance. How does this relate to me? How is this an important food for my soul; some important moment for me to take in, okay? So we have five factors...(crosstalk) 

00:21:10
RICH SIMON Wait, stay with that one a little bit more, Rick. So, uh, for example, what, what is, how'd, uh, personal meaning, I had, that, that one I, I wasn't so familiar with, so what's, what's an, what's an example of that, the thought process that might make it that, kind of, a memory, um, more prominent and more likely to be recalled? 

00:21:30
RICK HANSON Yeah, so let's suppose our client is grappling with anxiety, mo-, a lot of people are one way or another, and let's suppose that the client and, um, I or oneself, have focused on the recognition that growing, helping to encourage it, the resource of an inner sense of strength would help this person feel less anxious, less outgunned, uh, or overrun by the forces outside, all right? So now, this person is having an experience of inner strength that's activated and now we're trying to help it install. One way to m-, to build up a sense of personal relevance, which is a factor in learning that is well-established in research, uh, would be, let's say for the client to realize that, oh, it's good for me having felt a little bit like a wimp going through life to realize actually I'm more robust than I thought I was. Or, it's good for me to generalize as, let's say a woman who has been, sort of, pushed around to some extent, or socialized to feel, uh, less assertive, uh, compared to others, that it's good that I can sit a little straighter and, yeah, I'm allowed to have this, kind of, strength. However a person goes into that, I'm not trying to stereotype here, I'm just...(crosstalk) 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, sure. 

00:22:50
RICK HANSON ...throwing around the different modes of personal relevance. Uh, speak of myself, one of my main, uh, one of my own light bulb moments in my mid-20s was the realization that going to school, I'd been a wimp, but not a nerd. I mean, I'd been a nerd, not a wimp! I got that wrong! 

00:23:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:00
RICK HANSON Oh, my God. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:23:05
RICK HANSON I've gotta get that out of my head. I've gotta unlearn that. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON Change that neural structure immediately. Okay. 

00:23:10
RICK HANSON So, anyway, so that, that, those, if you think of what's known already in research, this robust research on learning to promote, um, uh, learning. 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON So there's something of enduring value that one can see moving forward into the future. That it's something that will not only feel good in the moment, but will, uh, something you wanna, uh, have, uh, available to you, that you wanna carry on with you as you move through your life. 

00:23:35
RICK HANSON Yeah, that would be an example of personal relevance and then the others, just quick recap: duration, um, embodiment, intensity, uh, novelty, and personal relevance. Those are well-known factors, so the more we get them going and we often can't do all of them. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:23:50
RICK HANSON But any port in a storm, right? We're just trying to, it's like a fire a little bit. Uh, step one, you light the fire; that you have the positive experience in the first place. It's activated. Step two, you add logs to the fire; you enrich the experience. And then step three, you absorb it; you, uh, prime memory systems by intending and sensing that the experience is really sifting down into you. In effect, you let the fire warm you, you take in its heat. This third step has the least, uh, available body of knowledge to draw upon. Uh, but it is clear that people can heighten memory and learning through intention. In other words, if it's really your intention to remember something, including a personal experience; I remember being in Hawaii once with my wife and there was a sunset that was spectacular, even by Hawaiian standards, and I just said to myself, you know, this is a keeper, let this one, you know, sink in. Or the feeling you get maybe at your child's graduation, or you're getting, uh, uh, really nice praise at work and, and there's a feeling and you think to yourself this one's a keeper. Put this one in the memory box, let the feelings sink in. You might forget the event, but the feeling goes in. You know, I think it's, again, it can't hurt, and if nothing else, this focus on the third step of absorption extends the second step of enriching. 

00:25:15
RICH SIMON This is, there's a connection here between we, in an earlier series on wisdom, uh, we did an int-, interview with Daniel Kahneman, who had written a book called ' Thinking Fast and Slow' and he has a term called, about system one, system two. So system one is largely this automatic 98, on a good day it's 98, mainly it's 99.9% of just automatic functioning. And then system two is what bringing, and this isn't, this by no means is totally, this is what you're describing is a small part of system two, but through attention and effort, acts that require us to, uh, give attention and effort to something or what might be called the, uh, the interest way into system two. So you're...(crosstalk) 

00:26:00
RICK HANSON Yes. 

00:26:00
RICH SIMON ...describing moving things from this, kind of, system one, uh, vague background experience into a part of system two of through the ap-, application of attention and effort. 

00:26:10
RICK HANSON Yeah, I think using that language, um, I'm talking in a sense about using system two, which is very deliberate, to some extent top-down directed efforts to gradually sss-, change system one...(crosstalk) 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

00:26:25
RICK HANSON ...so that the automatic activations in system one become increasingly tilted in useful directions; you know, less tilted toward alarm, less tilted toward anger, less tilted toward feelings of inadequacy and so forth. 

00:26:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, okay. 

00:26:40
RICK HANSON Um, I should add actually there's a sixth factor in, um, building up memory traces in terms of the enriching phase. That is enactment. The more we actually do something, or act it out, uh, again, the better, whether it's, um, enacting it physically like sitting up a little straighter to enhance the experience of...(crosstalk) 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:27:00
RICK HANSON ...or making something with art, uh, there's an enactment there, uh, you know, talking out loud or making an imaginary speech to someone you want to be assertive with, for example; that's a different kind of enactment. So that would be a sixth factor. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON And it's interesting that in, uh, and, and I think you're, you're, you're very articulate about these processes and, uh, there's a whole, it seems to me any number of people in the field are exploring this territory. And one of the themes here is the similarity, we had the old idea of insight leads to change and it can, but this idea that so many changes are, uh, psychological changes or have more affinities to the kinds of things we associate with athletic skill or musical practice. Practice and this principle of repeated, repeating something and, and, uh, the neuroplastic principle of repetition is a very strong factor in psychological and emotional growth and change. 

00:28:00
RICK HANSON I know. It's funny, I mean, this could be hopefully not bizarre, but I guess I think to myself about our evolved nature and our animal nature and it's a little bit like training a pet or a dog likes repetition, but to me there's a kindness in it...(crosstalk) 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:20
RICK HANSON It's like my little, I think, honestly I have a little menagerie inside and I simplify it as...(crosstalk) 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, I love that. 

00:28:25
RICK HANSON ...I'll explain later. You know, I have my own little lizard, my own little rat and my own little monkey inside. And I'm trying to help 'em along. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:28:30
RICK HANSON They need repetition and especially, I'll explain this later, the lizard needs a lot of repetition. 

00:28:35
RICH SIMON .We'll get to that in a moment. That's great. That's great. I like that. 

00:28:40
RICK HANSON His neuroplasticity is really minimal down in the brain stem. But anyway...(crosstalk) 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:28:45
RICK HANSON Um, so we have these three steps. Again, to repeat, these are done intuitively, I think, uh, by, by therapists and more explicitly different therapy schools. But if you think about it, if you want to convert a mental state to a neural trait, if you want to install and activate a condition in the mind/brain system this, kind of, polarizing mental neural state, how do you do it? Well, you gotta enrich the experience and you heighten the memory traces by intending and sensing that it become absorbed. So those are the three steps. Um, maybe I'll mention how I use them with clients? 

00:29:20
RICH SIMON Absolutely, yeah, that's the, that's the element here. Okay. 

00:29:25
RICK HANSON Yeah, so, um, how I use them with clients is how I think therapists use any method really with clients and there're four different ways. Uh, I should digress and say my kids tease me. They say, 'Dad, what's your four point plan for this one?' So, I...(crosstalk) 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:40
RICK HANSON You've probably noticed already I do tend to think in terms of plans. That's why...(crosstalk) 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON That you tend to think in terms of points. 

00:29:40
RICK HANSON I'm trying to mask my OCD here. 

00:29:45
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. 

00:29:45
RICK HANSON Anyway, uh, the first thing we do is we just do it with people without really telling them what we're doing. For example, if we have in our mind some clarity that certain states of mind are the doorway into growing a resource in the brain of our client. Then when we, we might try to get that state going, you know, activate it or if we get it going or we notice that it's already going, we've lit the fire, then we try to protect the fire. We interrupt the client so they don't change the subject, we help them stay with it longer, we, we might ask them how it is in their body, we might ask them about the personal relevance, uh, we might acknowledge and then set aside blocks, which is a whole conversation. People really block taking in the good for a variety of reasons sometimes. And exploring that is very useful clinically, a defense analysis, in a sense. Anyway, so we do this intuitively with people. So that's the first way that we apply taking in the good. The second way, again, as with any method, is that we teach it to the client and then we leave it alone. And they do whatever they do. We mention something that could be useful, you know, deep breathing could be useful, and then we keep going. And they do it or they don't. Or we say, you know, maybe thinking about your mother might be useful and then we keep going or not. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:31:15
RICK HANSON All right, that's fine. Uh, and there's a lot, you know, this is, I think, in the field there's more and more willingness to, um, sort of, bibliotherapy to just educate clients about things and then we don't pursue it particularly, but they might get a lot of value out of it. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:31:30
RICK HANSON The third way we use this method, as with any method, is we do it with people explicitly in the therapy room. So, for example, you might very explicitly say, you know, based on this idea of taking in the good and the importance of changing your brain from the inside out, and overcoming and compensating for the negativity bias, etc., etc. let's try it. I notice right now that you are, let's say, feeling, kind of, glad and grateful about something good in your life and you've been grappling and stymied by this blue mood. Let's see if we can stay with it. Let's see if we can get more logs on that fire. Then you obviously adapt how you talk to your own personal style, the nature and age, whatever, of the client, you get it going. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON You might use focusing or somatic technique to light up more of the Christmas tree of people's nervo-, nervous system to really intensify that, that state. 

00:32:20
RICK HANSON Yeah, exactly. We, we draw on those methods, gestalt methods, we may bring in imagery. It's really great. When you know what you're doing, you know, many roads lead to Rome. If Rome is brain change, many ways there. And then one thing is I really love about this general framework we're exploring here is that It, it's creative and resourceful and hopeful. Cause you can just try different things, but you're really clearing your target; moment-to-moment, you're tracking this 20 second window. You have a window of structure building. What are you trying to get done in that 20 second window, rather than waste it? All right. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:55
RICK HANSON So, that's the third thing we do. And then the fourth way we use this method of taking in the good is we give the client homework or we encourage them to have some, kind of, application in the, you know, 167 hours in the week when they're not in our office, let's say. Uh, and that's where forms like, uh, a daily checklist can come in, you know, a lot of the, uh, cognitive behavioral therapy methods can be very useful here. Or, uh, maybe the client will decide, hey, how about just before going to sleep, take a minute or two, it's a really good time cause your brain's this hypnogogic, kind of, moment, and you reflect on, like, the three blessings exercise. Reflect on three things that you're glad about or grateful for, uh, including accomplishments or good qualities in yourself, not just good things that have happened to you or are conditions in your life. Uh, let it sink in. or maybe we might know that they daily do some yoga or meditation; hey, at the end of your meditation or prayer, how about taking an extra 30 seconds or even a minute to get a sense of the benefits of it. Really register it, really land it so that you can take them with you wherever you go. Or at a meal, or, you know, you have this long bus ride, how about just using a few minutes or a minute even, um...(crosstalk) 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON So what strikes me about what, what you're saying now, it's, we've just done an issue of the magazine call-, called, uh, the, uh, 'The Rise of Therapeutic Coaching'. So there's this, it, you're really expanding for, for many people, some people have been doing this for some time, but this notion you're, kind of, a brain coach, with your clients. So we have the standard, many of us trained in a non-directive style, which we equate with the therapeutic stance universally, uh, invariably and what you're underlying here is that there's a function here and as we move more into really promoting learning, there, the differences between developing skills and the, kind of, learning that we associate with, uh, skills in life and the skill of being an emotionally resonant related human being, perhaps they're not so terribly different after all. 

00:35:05
RICK HANSON Yeah, I, I, um, appreciate you saying that. I think it's really true and it, it underscores in a sense or a take-away from it is, uh, to me an important theme of humility and modesty. To appreciate that we, you know, that we don't need to reinvent the wheel here. Um, the other thing about it though, it's interesting, I always train psychoanalytically, uh, paramount, initially and so I'm, as you said, I'm thoughtful about the transference and I think we can miss, uh, make mistakes in our enthusiasm, our, as Greenspan put it, irrational exuberance, if you will, for the brain. Uh, and overstep our bounds, uh, and have negative reactions brewing in the mind of the client. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:50
RICK HANSON Um, so anyway, all that said, so those to me are different ways to use these methods and in everyday life it's helpful to appreciate that when people start take, taking in the good, as it were, you know, 30 seconds at a time, half a dozen times a day, that's three minutes a day, five minutes tops. 

00:36:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:10
RICK HANSON Or, let's say, in the therapy hour, maybe there are three or four moments where you're really trying to help some good thing land...(crosstalk) 

00:36:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:20
RICK HANSON ...and stick. It doesn't take over a lot. It's not a therapy. It's, to me, it's a way to really capture the benefit of whatever therapy you're doing with people. And to, you know, leverage and turbo charge those benefits for what people do out in the world. Uh, I remember reading something in your magazine, which, by the way, I want to send a super shout out about, it's an incredible service and a great resource to people, I think there was a, uh, a section, kind of, a news blurb recently about how a few people are doing psychotherapy today compared to 10 years ago. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Yeah, just the last issue, right. 

00:36:55
RICK HANSON Speaking of humbling, and, um, I think one of the reasons, honestly, is the efficacy of psychotherapy. Um, yes, research studies show that its efficacy as is are greater than antidepressants, but I think it's, kind of, like a variation on, hopefully this is not an offensive analogy, you know, 20, 30, 50 years ago or maybe even today if you come from some 'X' population that's been historically marginalized or discriminated against you've gotta be twice as good, three times as good; for us as therapists, to swim upstream against the folks in the lab coats. And advertising budgets have big farm out. You need to be really, really, really good. And I think the truth is, in our field, it's humbling to appreciate, um, how we have, you know, lost a lot of opportunities; out of ignorance, uh, not out of malintent, but lost a lot of opportunities to help our clients have a steeper learning curve. And I think the more that we can help people have that steep learning curve, uh, the more that therapy will be, will return to its proper position of respect and...(crosstalk) 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON So, so part of, two things I think that are especially, um, helpful, so, so we've been talking about a method, we've been talking about, uh, these principles of learning and, and, and brain change, so, one of the things that strikes me about what you've developed is, uh, a, kind of, uh, a way of thinking about what you as a therapist are trying to address; how you can be helpful and the kind of experience that you want to help a client to have. And there are these two sides of it about resources that the client may not have at their disposal currently or underdeveloped resources and healing from pain are two sides of the therapeutic coin. So, really, um, really like the way that you formulated that. So, so talk to us about how that informs the way you structure your psychotherapy. 

00:38:50
RICK HANSON Yeah, thank you. So, then to take this idea of structure building in a way to the next level really, uh, so far I've talked about how to do it and, and also, I think, it's useful to, to use just, generically, sense. Any good moment, any port in the storm has an opportunity to get it to sink in. But the deeper level is to start thinking about this in terms of our formulation for our client. What's the key resource that would make a lot of difference here; with this client maybe dealing with this issue in that situation, what would really help that person if they had that arrow in their quiver, as it were or they had that nutrient in their body? What's their vitamin C? And so that takes me to, uh, a model that's been for me, extremely helpful as a framework for thinking about, uh, client needs and the antidotes, experiences, uh, that will start building the resources inside that they can use for those needs. So quick model here, to simplify, all models simplify, brain involving three stages, brainstem, subcortical, uh, limbic system and then cortex sitting on top, loosely corresponding to reptile, mammal, finally human. Those three levels of the brain and stages of evolution loosely developed to focus on three fundamental needs, avoiding harms, app-, uh, approaching rewards and attaching to others. And today the brain works as a whole to accomplish all these purposes, but the way it does it is very shaped by the legacy of, uh, the evolution of the brain. 

00:40:30
RICH SIMON The neurological structures that, that are our evolutionary heritage. 

00:40:35
RICK HANSON Yeah, for example, fear trumps hope. In other words, uh, you know, rule one in the wild is eat lunch today, don't be lunch today. So as soon as we feel threatened, that hijacks the approaching systems and the attaching systems and starts using it to its own ends, okay. So those are these three needs, all right, and then, um, I think the brain has fundamentally, and others think this too, two settings, two ways of going about meeting those needs and two places it defaults to when it does or does not feel that those needs are met. In other words, when people experience a basic sense of safety, in terms of avoiding harm, a basic sense of enoughness in terms of approaching reward and a basic sense of attachment, inclusion, being part of the band, uh, feeling loved in terms of a-, attaching to others, the brain defaults to its responsive mode. It's a homeostatic, sustainable, uh, mode in which the body repairs and refuels itself. And the mind basically, in terms of those three systems and three words, enters a basic sense of peacefulness, happiness and love. That's the good news, the responsive mode of the brain. That's our home base. On the other hand, we have its other setting of the brain its reactive mode, its fight or flight or freeze in peace mode that we go into when we experience that our needs are fundamentally not being met in those three ways. Uh, and then in that state, your body burns resources faster than it replenishes them, uh, long-term building projects, like in the immune system, are put on hold and the mind is colored in terms of those three needs, avoiding, approaching, attaching, in three words, hatred, greed and heartache. Now, for those of you that have any background in Buddha psychology recognize I'm talking about the three poisons here. Okay, and I'm adding a fourth as it were, greed, hatred, delusion and then heartache, okay. Um, we evolve to go into the reactive mode. It has short-term benefits. Uh, it gets us away from the charging tiger, right or charging lion. But it's a faulty road and why zebras don't get ulcers, most episodes of stress in the wild are resolved quickly, one way or another. And then the template is to have a long period of recovery where we reenter the responsive mode. But these days, unfortunately, we're experiencing mild to moderate, uh, reactive mode activation, you know, a surge and then maybe a very brief recovery period and then there's the next one and the next one and the next one or it's just chronic, multitasking, uh, dealing with bad news all the time, being jacked up by media, chronic stress, stuck in traffic, all the rest of that. All right, so that's, kind of, a framework here. So, for me, that's actually been a very useful way because DSM-IV five can be sorted into those three systems, uh, in terms of pathological excesses of reactive brain states. For example, the fear disorders like PTSD or, or anxiety go into the avoiding harm system, um, you know, addictions, as well as, I think, a lot of depression because the sense of loss relates to the approaching reward system. And a lot of the personality disorders and certainly attachment issues and a lot of every day angst, um, in terms of relationship issues, feeling lonely, unloved, or de-, you devalue, ashamed, uh, inadequate or guilty, uh, the social emotions, if you will, morbid self-preoccupations, um, and so forth relate to the attachment system of the brain. So based on that formulation, if you're thinking about your client, if your client has an issue with the avoiding system of the brain, they're anxious about something, giving them uh, a resource or giving them a supply, as it were, a mental state that they can use to build a resource that is in the approaching reward system is a carrot, isn't very helpful. If you're pounded, being pounded with sticks, carrots don't solve your problem, all right. Also, for example, if you're feeling lonely or disconnected or recently dissed or discounted or dismissed in a relationship, uh, feeling safer is not gonna solve your problem. You need, you know, if you have scurvy you need vitamin C, a carrot isn't gonna help. If you're anemic, you need iron, vitamin C is not gonna help. So what's your targeted resource experience that's gonna build what you...(crosstalk) 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON ...or the antidote exp-, so give us an example, get, so concretely, within each of these systems, the kinds of things that characteristically, how do you think as a clinician once you've identified somebody's arena of difficulty is each of these three different, uh, brain systems. 

00:45:20
RICK HANSON Right, I, I ask myself three questions. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:45:20
RICK HANSON There, I'm doing a list again, but there you have it. 

00:45:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. It's great. It's so clear. I love it. 

00:45:30
RICK HANSON I think it's because doing therapy is such a murky, messy process we need these little bouys of clarity in the island, in the sea of chaos. Anyway, um, so first off, I ask myself what's wrong? Right. What's going wrong? Where's the suffering? Where's the dysfunction? You know, very straightforward, clinical, kind of, question. The second ques-, question I ask myself is, what would make it right? What if it were present, would make all the difference in the world? And I'll say in passing that there are a few questions that help me answer that. One is what would have made all the difference in the world in this person's childhood or first marriage or early adult, uh, young adult experiences or etc. What would have made a lot of difference for this person? Another question is, what do they keep longing for? What's the itch that's not yet deeply scratched? And another way into this question of what would make it right, you know, my second question is, uh, what kind of experience or memory do they keep going back to as having been really wonderful or having made a lot of difference for them. Like, for example, people will talk about spending a summer on the farm with Aunt Sue or their first boyfriend, uh, etc. Those are all clues for what would make it really right. Or, to use the language that you're, you're talking about here, what would antidote this ailment? Or what's the vitamin C they need? Or what would particularly fill their own hole in the heart? That's my second question. And then when I get that question answered, and that's the important question, the second one, I ask myself third, okay, what experiences would help build that resource inside that person? How can we get that vitamin into this person's brain, okay? So, has that a frame now. I'll use an example here, um, so let's say I, I have a client who, uh, was really, uh, neglected as a child, a man, a professional man in his early 50s. And, so he has a very strong sense of feeling unwanted and a great longing to feel wanted. That's what's wrong. It's not wrong with him, you know what I mean? That's what's wrong in his mind, all right? Two, what's his vitamin C? What would make all the difference in the world? It's pretty straightforward that what would make an enormous difference for him is feeling wanted and included and special, and attuned to and understood, especially by a woman. He's heterosexual, lot of his wound is with his mother, so that would be for him, his healing experiences. And, of course, this is not rocket science. This is case conference 101. But it's a way to think systematically about what we're trying to do. Uh, so, so he needs those experiences and the ones that have really high value for him are ones in which he's a little revealed, he's being a little imperfect and the nurturing woman loves him anyway and takes him to her heart. Okay, great, that's really, really good. Uh, lesser versions of that are helpful but that really has a high impact experience for him. So then, step three, he and I, and I'm, he, it's clinically appropriate for me to show my thinking with him, very intelligent, you know, a person with a real interest in, in helping himself here, we are now zeroed in on how can he help himself have these experiences at work or in his, kind of, up and down romantic relationship or with the wives of his good friends, you know, in a wholesome and appropriate way. How can he have, uh, this experience of being really included, seen, cared about and loved and then when he has it, how can he interrupt his natural tendency, this is where the blocks point comes in, to deflect or push away that experience. And then, then we're doing, kind of, pretty standard issue therapy around that but we're looking for ways for him to have that experience, uh, I'm a guy so it's not quite as high impact. I actually referred this person to a ancillary female therapist for exactly these kinds of experiences and then we're, kind of, doing a co-therapy there. Um, so that, that would be an example, that would be an illustration. 

00:49:55
RICH SIMON And, and, just let me just underline something about that way of thinking clinically cause ss-, often and this is I don't think what you're talking about is, uh, is widely understood in, in training centers for psychotherapists, you're talking about people not only having insight and an understanding of their, we're very problem oriented profession traditionally; we have a very extensive vocabulary for the difficulties people have in life, but we don't talk en-, enough about, it seems, and increasingly in addition to you there's a whole, uh, there's a whole part of the field really talking about how do we, uh, provide, help people find experiences that enable them and I love your, your vocabulary here about resources, about creating from, moving from states, temporary states, traits, that enable them to have a sense of wholeness in life, a sense of connection or whichever domain, brain domain you're talking about, that they're, they become more, effect more responsive, more capable of taking care of their needs, whatever those needs happen to be. 

00:51:00
RICK HANSON Yeah, it also gets very interesting because, um, to use Freud's language, it's, you, it helps you really be quite insightful into the client's resistance or, uh, to update it more their, you know, their younger coping methods, which are now problematic, actually, for these symptoms. So, for example, again using this client, uh, here, even though he knows rationally that he should allow himself, as you put it, to experience feeling seen, included, uh, embraced, even if he's a little messy and his nose is running or what have you, right? 

00:51:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:51:40
RICK HANSON Uh, even though he knows that rationally, understandably, he's terrified of having those experiences. Because when he has those experiences, they activate longings for him, which in his history were associated with frustration, humiliation and enormous, disorganizing pain. 

00:51:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:55
RICK HANSON And so, the, since we're now trying, he understands rationally how the brain builds structure. This is where I think a little brain talk is quite helpful...(crosstalk) 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:52:05
RICK HANSON ...to clients and motivating, you know, you're avoiding the pitfalls and he understands this. Still, it's really hard for him to sustain 10, 20 seconds in a row of feeling seen and understood and embraced and to be able to tolerate the longings that come up, as well as the distress tolerance around them. So then interestingly, sometimes what we need to do is to go offline a little bit to resource the person to tolerate the distress that having the key vitamin C and the antidote experiences, uh, activates in them. But again, we're in the language here of positive brain change. And again, we're trying to get, okay, what would make a difference here and then how can I install that in neural structure? 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, so that we have about five minutes to go and the other piece that we talked about a moment ago, so the, so there's these positive resource states and, and some of it, many of us are undeveloped in these different areas and there's a whole range of difficulties in life and, and you have a system, as you do with many things, for, uh, giving us a map for all those. Now there's, there's this other issue of people coming in and they're trying to heal from old pains. 

00:53:20
RICK HANSON Right. 

00:53:20
RICH SIMON This is a huge part of the practices of most of us, so talk to us about that and how you're understanding of the brain has shaped a different kind of way of responding to these folks. 

00:53:25
RICK HANSON Yeah, thank you. Well so, so far in terms of taking in the good, I've talked about, um, only the positive. In other words, you're having positive experiences. Quick sidebar, um, you don't do this to cling to them, because paradoxically as people fill up the hole in their heart, their clinging actually reduces. There's less and less craving for an external source of provision because they have internalized it, increasingly over time when so-called corrective emotional experiences occur and this resource is now inside the person. Cultivation undoes craving. Okay, that said, um, the other thing is that, um, you can use, oh, positive experiences are not always pleasant. For example, healthy remorse doesn't feel positive, but it's a positive experience pragmatically, in the sense that it leads to happiness and welfare for oneself and others...(crosstalk) 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON In the long-term. 

00:54:20
RICK HANSON And not all pleasant experiences are pragmatically positive, like addictive experiences, okay? So, I'm using positive in that way; and negative, as well as good and bad. Okay, so, so far I've spoken about only having positive experiences. You can use these antidote experiences, uh, these vitamin Cs to help resource a person to heal old pain, because gradually flowers crowd out weeds. Just getting more flowers in the garden of the client's mind will slowly, over time crowd out weeds. But you're not directly addressing the weeds. That's where the fourth step of taking in the good comes in. That's where you pair a positive and a negative material in awareness at the same time. Again, I did not invent this, this is natural to therapy it's also natural with other methods like prayer, or self-talk, talking yourself off the ledge, comparing. To do it most powerfully, I wanna offer a couple suggestions here. Number one, have the positive be much more prominent than the negative. Otherwise, the negative will start associating with the positive. And then when the person is done thinking about it anymore, then that material is being reconsolidated back in implicit memory. Uh, the pos-, the negative may dominate...(crosstalk) 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Give us an example, Rick. So, this seems like a really key point, so concretize this for us, what is, what you're...(crosstalk) 

00:55:35
RICK HANSON So I'll use this client again. Um, so now let's suppose that my client is having a strong activated experience of being included, understood, embraced and loved by a woman; it, not, it's not romantic or sexual, but It's very, its pre-oedipal as it were, it's very young, okay. He's having an experience. He could either just have that experience, which is the important vitamin C for him, or additionally, he could have an awareness of this positive experience, kind of, connecting with and going into that old pain. Maybe reaching that little boy inside him who always longed for that experience, or just a sense of the young layer in the strata of his psyche, or there could be simply a knowing that this is connecting with that old pain, or he could do something really quite, uh, um, engaged and active like, he could imagine the little boy in him being cuddled by this woman, let's say, at work, who's being nice to him and helpful and caring. Uh, so there's, that's the pairing up method. Those are different ways of doing it. To be able to do pairing, you cannot be hijacked by the old pain. So, I don't think this is a good method for dealing with a black hole center of trauma, because it's just overwhelmingly powerful. Uh, but if you could keep the positive experience prominent and not get sucked into the negative and pull both in awareness or go back and forth fairly quickly. This is a very, very powerful method. 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:57:10
RICK HANSON And then it goes to, uh, some new technologies that are emerging, uh, including, for example, Bruce Ecker's work around coherence therapy. As well as new paradigms using animal research here, in which, uh, we use this pairing, we can use this pairing, not just to overwrite old negative material in implicit memory, which is what typically happens, but to actually erase the negative material during the reconsolidation phase. Because when a state of mind, including an upset, like feeling unloved or feeling really angry, or a craving for an addictive substance, let's say, when that's no longer activated in the mind, it gets rebuilt, reconsolidated back into memory stores. During that reconsolidation phase, which is very dynamic, there's about a, it's loose, but about a 20 to 40 minute window there where it's vulnerable to intervention and with skillfulness you can erase it. And here's a paradigm for dealing with it. Uh, with, um, animals, drugs are being used but they're too toxic for humans. Drug companies are searching for drugs that can do this. Meanwhile, as a therapist, here's how to actually do it. The trick is, after you've...(crosstalk)

RICH SIMON So, let me just underline this to make sure that people get what you're talking about cause it's, it's a very, it's a fascinating idea that we had this notion that certain negative states, anxieties and so forth, they can't, they can't be erased. You can override them to a certain extent, with new experience, but they're always there. You're always wounded, no matter what. So you're, uh, and, and so what you're bringing our attention to is this new, uh, vein of research which, uh, is presenting this other idea that perhaps we can really co-heal in that, that very overused term in our field, but we can literally heal from some of these wounds and not, not just, uh, put dressing on them and bandages on top of it? 

00:59:15
RICK HANSON Yeah, with a little, um, qualification there; the qualification is that, uh, when we are going through a growth process like therapy, uh, we are overwriting those old memories and, uh, that's good, all right? And we, uh, we live in, uh, a better state of mind. That's really good. The problem is, it makes us vulnerable because, um, it once an old negative memory has occurred in the first place, even if we've overwritten it with positive stuff, it's easy for us to relearn that negative. It's like a weed that sprouts back up again...(crosstalk) 

00:59:50
RICH SIMON To reactivate that experience, that negative experience. 

00:59:55
RICK HANSON So if we want to truly erase it during the reconsolidation phase, here's the protocol. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:00:00
RICK HANSON So you activate both the positive and negative together, um, and you are associating them with very traditional counterconditioning in a sense and you're trying to make the positive more powerful than the negative. Okay, then step two, as it were, you tell the person, okay, let the negative go, now were just in the positive alone. We're just staying with his positive resource experience. And then, you, kind of, move on. And then several times like, 3 to 5 to 10 times even, over the next 20 to 40 minutes, you regenerate the positive that you had going in the mind of your client with no reference whatsoever to the negative. 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:00:50
RICK HANSON The exposure repeatedly during this window of reconsolidation, this vulnerable period, in a good way, to get rid of that old crud, to truly pull the tip of the root of the dandelion, so the darn root doesn't keep growing back...(crosstalk) 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Sprout again, okay. 

01:01:05
RICK HANSON Yeah, um, is to just have purely positive again and again and again. Now, the pure positive exposure 10, 20, 30 seconds is fairly quick. But it needs to be done repeatedly and that, uh, new studies are starting to show, there were studies published in Science Magazine, kind of, the gold standard in nature, in terms of science journals, within the last 12 months about this protocol, uh, and actually, I'm recalling now, this was used for addicts and to help truly erase craving memories, which are involved with the amygdala. And it showed that this particular protocol or variation on it, actually, uh, erased structure in the amygdala, actually altered structure in the amygdala of the brain, which is really quite remarkable. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON So you have, we're just about out of time here, but it's it really is this idea of, uh, coaching a, kind of, process of brain coaching, a, kind of, process of emotional healing in a way that is, that, that's new for our profession and interesting and as you, you were saying, uh, that there were all kinds of, um, we, we need to keep our traditional, uh, awareness of the relationship and the whole context of the therapy situation, but it's a, it's a new doorway. Um...(crosstalk) 

01:02:20
RICK HANSON Yeah, just to sum up, I think of this...(crosstalk) 

01:02:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:02:25
RICK HANSON ...as like a very important thread in the tapestry of a productive psychotherapy. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:02:30
RICK HANSON Uh, but if we're not paying attention to what the brain is learning, the growth curve is gonna be relatively flattened for our client and our own work won't be that rewarding to us personally. 

01:02:40
RICH SIMON And the, and as you kept pointing out throughout the course of this conversation, what's the implicit learning that, and that's what our therapeutic training and our understanding of our sensibility as a therapist is, remains a central, essential to the process. So, as we, as we come to a close here, again a reminder to everyone, here's your chance, it's particularly relevant, uh, having to talk to you, Rick, about using our brains, practicing, putting our comments down so that we make the connection between what we may have learned, questions we had, connections we made, during the course of this very interesting conversation with Rick, here. Uh, and sharing that with all of us so I really encourage everyone to contribute to the comment board. Important things, so people who are, that'd be interested and I, I imagine many, many people are, what is it, how do they follow up to find out more about resources, training resources, things to read, finding out more about this whole, uh, perspective on, on brain and on psychotherapy that you've been offering us here today. 

01:03:50
RICK HANSON Thank you. Uh, they could just search on my name, uh, and you'll come to my website, Rick Hanson, S-O-N .net, which has a ton of freely offered resources, including the slide sets, the PowerPoint slide sets from day long workshops I've done for therapists on this subject of how to take in the good. Um, also they might like Buddha's Brain, uh, the fourth chapter is on taking in the good. Uh, a little point in passing, I'm, uh, I'm, I've created a course in taking in the good, six classes over six weeks. Well, it looks like we're gonna run a study on it through UC Berkeley very soon, which is great and starting around 2014, I'll start training people in how to teach this course. So, that's, kind of, exciting actually, uh, to think about that; being increasingly available to people. 

01:04:35
RICH SIMON That's great. That's great. Uh, just really, uh, refreshing work, uh, and I think you've really, as much as any of our guests in the series really address this core question, what's the next step? Once we can, you can pronounce amygdala, where do you go from there? What's the next step of really putting these ideas to use and, and you've given us all kinds of, uh, fascinating, uh, suggestions, uh, and opened up, uh, opened doorways to how people can do that. 

01:05:05
RICK HANSON Thank you. 

01:05:05
RICH SIMON Thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here this afternoon, Rick. 

01:05:10
RICK HANSON Great. 

01:05:10
RICH SIMON And that, that's it for now. Look forward to being with you next time as we continue this exploration of neuroscience in action. See you then. Ba-bye.
