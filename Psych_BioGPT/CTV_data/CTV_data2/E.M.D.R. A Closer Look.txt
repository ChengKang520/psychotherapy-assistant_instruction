EMDR A CLOSER LOOK 

00:00:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO From the observation of thousands of EMDR treatments, it appears that within all of us, there is an information processing system. Now when a trauma occurs, it seems that this information processing system becomes imbalanced. And the perceptions that were there at the time of the event become locked metaphorically in their own neural network. They are unable to connect with anything more adaptive. 

00:00:50
LARRY E. BEUTLER, PH.D. Graduate School of Education, U.C. Santa Barbara Almost from its introduction in 1989, EMDR has been enthusiastically embraced by clinicians worldwide. Thousands of practitioners have been trained in the technique. There has been much documented satisfaction from both clinicians and clients. Yet, despite this interest and a great many broad claims, EMDR remains one of the most controversial treatments on the scene today. Hello. I am Dr. Larry E. Beutler of the counseling clinical school psychology program at the University of California at Santa Barbara. What has made EMDR so popular and at the same time so widely criticized? 

00:01:30
SANDRA A. WILSON, PH.D. Director, Spencer Curtis Foundation Colorado Springs, CO I think one of the things that makes EMDR so incredible to experience as I've watched several… I actually watched a couple of thousand sessions now over the last three years is that there is a revisiting of the trauma but that is what is so effective in the EMDR moves that trauma pass the current present state, so a person can say… finally get to a point where they say the bombing is over, the rape's over, the war's over and then they can start to heal in a healthy way as a result of their experience. 

00:02:05
TERENCE M. KEANE, PH.D. Director, National Center for PTSD, Boston MA EMDR is a treatment that has arrived de novo on the scene. Most scientific advances usually borrow from previously established principles and built on those previously established principles. This particular treatment approach didn’t really do that as… as Francine Shapiro herself describes it, she discovered that the eye movements resulted in changes in the affective reactions to memories and thoughts that she was having. That is not a very compelling reason although it's a legitimate reason, it's not a compelling reason scientifically. 

00:02:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And now just follow my finger with your eyes. 

00:02:40
NARRATOR In this tape we will look at the procedure itself, here from its originator Francine Shapiro and examine some of the claims and criticisms that have been made regarding EMDR. 

00:02:55
What is EMDR? 

00:03:00
DORI MAY KELLY And when I get stressful then I have nightmares and then I wake up. 

00:03:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO, PH.D. Could you tell me what the last nightmare was that you had? 

00:03:05
NARRATOR Throughout this videotape you will see Dr. Shapiro conducting EMDR procedures. Please keep in mind that this is not an actual therapy session and that this is not a real patient. There are also several references made to research on EMDR. These references and many others are documented in the manual that accompanies this videotape. 

00:03:25
DORI MAY KELLY And so I was screaming for him to stop and… 

00:03:30
NARRATOR What is EMDR? 

00:03:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO , Ph.D. Senior Research Fellow Mental Research Institute, Palo Alto CA Well, the natural reaction after a cataclysmic event would be having post stress symptoms for a while, remembering it for a longer period of time having a startle response to something like a… a truck rolling by might bring back the… the memory of an earthquake to a person. But over time, these things should remit as natural learning and processing of the information to take. It takes place then those types of symptoms are able to drop off. But for a number of people what seems to happen is that those perceptions that were there at the time of the event, get locked in the nervous system and they don’t change. 

00:04:10
NARRATOR According to the theory, the combination of the overall EMDR procedures, plus the eye movements are in some cases rhythmic hand taps or sounds, stimulate the information processing system. 

00:04:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So what we're going to do is ask you to concentrate on one of those memories and then we're gonna use the eye movement in order to stimulate that information processing system, so we can get that adjusted and what's useless is going to be able to be discarded just like a regular digestion process. 

00:04:40
DORI MAY KELLY Okay. 

00:04:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO When we have the client and we are asking them to follow our fingers with their eyes, we are activating that information processing system and we are simultaneously having them think of that target information, which means we're linking the active information processing system to that original information, therefore allowing it to get processed and metabolize. I think that's the easiest way to think about it. What the processes are, what exactly is involved, the brain mechanisms involved in the information processing system is probably gonna take anther ten years to find out. 

00:05:20
NARRATOR It is important to point out that the neurological model Dr. Shapiro uses is a construct, created to help explain what is being clinically observed, but which has not been validated by researches in the field. 

00:05:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO When we talk about the model, I wanna reiterate it uses the language, a brain physiology of neuropsychology, but there is not enough known in the whole field of neurophysiology to know whether it's true or not. 

00:05:45
KIM T. MUESER, PH.D. Dept. Psychiatry, Dartmouth Medical School I think it's helpful to look at the theory about the neurophysiological basis of the EMDR as primarily at this time a metaphor, not a theory as to the actual mechanisms by which EMDR might improve traumatic memories and stress reactions that occur following traumatic experiences, but rather a metaphor that makes elusions to certain psychological processes in the brain. 

00:06:10
EIGHT PHASES Taking the client history Preparing the client Performing an assessment Desensitization Installation Body scan Closure Reevaluation. 

00:06:10
NARRATOR There are eight phases in the EMDR procedure. These are taking the client history, preparing the client, performing an assessment, desensitization, installation, body scan, closure, and reevaluation. EMDR takes place over a number of sessions. The therapist moves from one phase to the next always in the same order as each phase is completed. However, not all phases occur in each session. 

00:06:40
Taking the client history 

00:06:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Alright. So what brings you here? 

00:06:45
DORI MAY KELLY Well, I've had nightmares and sleep disturbances for pretty much as long as I can remember and… 

00:06:55
NARRATOR This person believes her nightmares are related to a childhood incident of sexual abuse. 

00:06:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO We talk about a three-pronged approach in EMDR past, present and future that when we take the clinical history, we're trying to fill in what are the earlier events that set the foundation for the problem. When we're looking at any client it's not on the basis if they have such and such diagnosis, but rather we ask the client specifically what… what’s bringing you here, what are you prevented from doing that you would like to do. And then identifying for each of those problem areas what are the earlier memories that set the foundation for it, where did they learn to act this way and we wanna make sure that we process those and then what are the present situations that stimulate the disturbance, what's going on in the present that causes you to feel more depressed or that you will be abandoned or not lovable etc., and we make sure we target those and then we also have to identify what new skills and behaviors does the client need to learn in order to… to be able to act more adaptively in the future. 

00:08:00
Preparing the client. 

00:08:00
NARRATOR In the next phase, a therapeutic report is developed in order to foster a sense of safety and allow the client to comfortably express the feelings being experienced. 

00:08:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The relationship is important because the aspect of EMDR that is very essential is the ability to notice what's going on internally that's coming up from the past as they are feeling safe in the present. So the idea is when we start stimulating it the old material to just come to the surface and just think of it, it is just old stuff just coming right out of your system, right? Just pretend you on a train and it are just the scenery passing by. So you just notice it, just notice it. 

00:08:40
DORI MAY KELLY Okay. 

00:08:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO This is really important because if we look at post-traumatic stress disorder, one of the manifestations of it that hold down(ph) in place is avoidance. So the automatic response of… for people with something disturbing comes up is to push it away. With EMDR we simply want them to notice it. So the clinician prepares them about how to do it, teaches them self-control techniques so that they know if they wanna stop and let go off the disturbance they can’t, they don’t have to be afraid of being overwhelmed by it. They know what might happen so that not surprised that the type of material that emerges and they know that are in control. They have a stop signal and if they wanna stop, they stop. It's a very client-centered model where the client is in control in the… the center of the whole process and that's the type of preparation that needs to get done. 

00:09:25
Performing an assessment 

00:09:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Let’s work on that nightmare, alright. And if you're gonna bring up to mind a scene that represented the whole event, what would it be? 

00:09:40
NARRATOR In this phase the clinician and client begin to identify specific therapeutic targets. 

00:09:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO We ask the client to identify an image that represents the entire event, usually the worst part of the event for them. 

00:09:55
NARRATOR Once the primary image has been identified, the client is asked to associate that image with a negative perception about it. 

00:10:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And what words might go with that picture that might express a negative belief about yourself, I’m not in control, what might it be? 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:15
DORI MAY KELLY Ah… I'm not good enough. I'm… I'm something that I don’t… to him that I don’t wanna be. 

00:10:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:25
DORI MAY KELLY Ah… that's pretty much it. 

00:10:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The person may be saying, I'm dirty, I'm worthless, I should have done something. I'm not loveable, I'll be abandoned and the… that verbalization then gives you the starting point and you ask them then what positive belief would you rather have instead. 

00:10:45
DORI MAY KELLY I would like to just be happier with who I am… have better relationships and just generally more joy… 

00:10:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:10:55
DORI MAY KELLY …in my life. 

00:11:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So I do deserve love. I'm fine as I am. 

00:11:05
DORI MAY KELLY Yeah, right. 

00:11:05
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. You are asking them how far can they see down the train track and that might be to I can learn to trust myself or I can learn to… to um… to act effectively. It's as far as they can possibly imagine. But it gives them a light at the end of the tunnel. They begin to see fully how the earlier belief, the negative belief is irrational that there are alternatives and it also starts stimulating that positive information. 

00:11:30
RATING SCALES SUD Subjective units of Disturbance VOC Validity of Cognition Subjective units of Disturbance THE CLIENT RATES THE LEVEL OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS FROM 0 to 10 Validity of Cognition MEASURES THE CLIENT’S POSITIVE BELIEF HE OR SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON A SCALE FROM 1. COMPLETELY FALSE TO 7. COMPLETELY TRUE. 

00:11:35
NARRATOR Dr. Shapiro uses two rating scales to assess the client’s state. Subjective units of Disturbance, SUD, and Validity of Cognition, VOC. When using the subjective units of disturbance, the client rates the level of emotional distress from 0 to 10. All negative emotions are rated such as guilt, anger, sadness and anxiety. Validity of cognition measures the client’s positive belief that he or she would like to have on a scale from one completely false to seven completely true. The clinician then uses these scales to work on the target event. 

00:12:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Do you have one scene that represents the whole experience for you? 

00:12:15
DORI MAY KELLY Yes. 

00:12:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Can you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:12:20
DORI MAY KELLY Ah… That would be… me being on the floor and being held down… 

00:12:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. 

00:12:30
DORI MAY KELLY …and my uncle on top of me. 

00:12:30
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay and when you hold that scene in mind, what words go along with that that might express your negative belief about yourself? 

00:12:40
DORI MAY KELLY That I… I don’t deserve good things. I don’t deserve love. 

00:12:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. And what words would you rather have? What… what belief would you rather have about yourself? 

00:12:55
DORI MAY KELLY That I'm a good person that I do deserve these things. 

00:13:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Great, yeah, okay. So hold the image in mind and hold the words I am a good person, I do deserve good things. And on a scale where one is completely false and seven is completely true, how truly they feel now? 

00:13:15
DORI MAY KELLY About a four. 

00:13:20
FRANCINE SHAPIRO About a four. Okay. So bring up the image of the event, bring up the positive cognition and how true does it feel now. And they give you the gut level response because many of them know they should be feeling that way that's why they came into therapy to begin with. They should be thinking that they are okay but they don’t. You wanna get the full emotional response to it. After we identify that aspect of it, we ask the client to bring up the image and the negative belief and to hold them together. You know bring the image to mind and bring the negative belief up, I don’t deserve love and when you hold the two together, what emotion comes up for you? 

00:14:05
DORI MAY KELLY Anger. 

00:14:05
Anger, okay. And from zero, which is neutral to ten the worst feeling you can think of, from zero to ten, how does it feel? 

00:14:15
DORI MAY KELLY About six. 

00:14:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO About six, okay. The two together stimulate the information to a greater degree and they identify then what emotion they are feeling. It's important that we do that because then the clinician can give the appropriate type of support and also you might turn up at the end of the session with the same level of disturbance, but it's changed from guilt to anger. So we know that something has evolved. After we identify the emotion, we get a… a baseline of how disturbing is it from zero, which is neutral, to ten the worst feeling that they can imagine and then where do they feel it in their body. 

00:14:55
DORI MAY KELLY In my stomach. 

00:14:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Your stomach, okay, good, good. Okay, so you know hold the image in mind and the words I don’t deserve love, notice the feeling in your stomach and now just follow my fingers with your eyes. What we brought together then are all of the different stored fragments of the memory. We have the image, we have the verbalization, we have the physical sensation, we have the baseline and then we are able to start the processing and go into the phase that we're calling desensitization and we are calling it that simply because we're using the zero to ten subjective units of disturbance scale to identify whether the treatment effects are complete. 

00:15:35
Desensitization 

00:15:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO But during this phase, what we're doing actually is clearing out all of the different associations that the client has with this target. Good, blank it out, take a deep breath. What do you get now? 

00:15:55
DORI MAY KELLY It… it's dissipated. It's… it's… came up well the eye movements were going quicker and then it just kind of started to go away. 

00:16:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So for going back to an earlier memory, there are a variety of associations that have been linked to that memory and we talk about a memory network like this that we have the target and then all of the associations that the client might have with their thinking about it, the different types of memories that are connected to it, the types of stimuli they are associated to it, during this desensitization phase, we start with the target and go down the different channels of association, then back to target and down the channel of association until we clean out all of the negative material that's associated to it and the client is then able to go back to the target and feel fine they would be at a zero SUD level and we'd say that completes the desensitization phase. 

00:16:50
Installation 

00:16:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. So now when you think of the words, I do deserve love, how do they feel… feel from one completely false to seven completely true? 

00:17:00
DORI MAY KELLY About a six. 

00:17:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. good. The installation phase uses the validity of cognition to test to check the treatment effects though the scale from one completely false to seven completely true. Now bring up the… the incident with your uncle and bring up the words I do deserve love and follow my fingers. We ask the client to bring up the positive cognition and to hold that in mind with the initial event and then we add in this stimulation until that positive information has increased and we continue to check the treatment effects on the validity of cognition scale, so the installation phase is completed when that positive cognition is felt on a gut level to be true at a level of six or seven. And from one to seven, how does it feel now? 

00:17:55
DORI MAY KELLY About a six and a half, seven. 

00:17:55
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Good. Then we would be moving over to the body scan stage and then we go back to that concept that the physical sensation would give us an indication of any information that's dysfunctionally stored. 

00:18:05
Body scan 

00:18:10
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. Now bring up the… the incident again, alright, and the words, I do deserve love, hold them together in your mind, close your eyes and just scan down your body, tell me if you feel any disturbance or attention anywhere. 

00:18:25
DORI MAY KELLY In my throat. 

00:18:25
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Okay. So we ask the client to bring up the target event, hold the positive cognition in mind, close their eyes and scan down their body and identify any residual tension or any negative sensation that's there and then we target that for processing. If we have a completely clean body scan, then we move over to the seventh phase, which is closure. 

00:18:45
Closure 

00:18:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO What… what we've done here is we've opened up the processing system like a digestion process. And as you go through the rest of the week, other things may come to mind, just notice it, take a good snapshot of it, just write down what happened, what you saw, thoughts that came up, the emotions, the sensations, just the way we did here. During the closure phase we wanna make sure always that the client leaves in better shape than they came in. So even if we haven’t completed the processing fully, we make sure that we do clo… techniques to bring the person back to equilibrium. We let them know what to expect in between sessions. We teach them how to use a log or a journal to identify any new targets that might come up and we also instruct them how to use their self-control techniques and stress reduction tapes in order to keep reminding them about their ability to be in control. Take a really good snapshot of it and then use the self-control technique or the tape that we've gone over in order to just let it go. And just remember if it comes up, it's just coming up like it's going out of the system just again, just notice it, just notice it, right. 

00:20:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO The reevaluation phase, which is the eighth phase begins every new session. We bring back earlier material that we’ve processed to see if the treatment effects have maintained, we identify any new perspective or any other channels or avenues that have to be addressed. 

00:20:15
Reevaluation 

00:20:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO So What I like you to do is… is bring up the incident we worked with last time and just close your eyes, bringing up and let me know any thoughts you have about it? 

00:20:25
DORI MAY KELLY It doesn’t have the emotional impact that it did before and I definitely feel like its something that is in the past and its not something that I’m living with now. 

00:20:40
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Hmm…Hmm… And how was your sleep been this week? 

00:20:45
Better. Much better. 

00:20:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO Great. 

00:20:50
Questions about EMDR The physiology of trauma and EMDR 

00:21:00
LARRY E. BEUTLER As doctor Shapiro notes, at this point the physiological changes associated with EMDR and the possible mechanisms that account both for these changes and for fear reduction among traumatized people who have been treated with EMDR are still unknown. The effect of EMDR on brain functioning is also unknown. Yet the mechanisms that Dr. Shapiro advance as a basis for EMDR effects are at the root of many of the criticisms that have been directed at this treatment. Ironically, the credibility of EMDR may have been more harm that help by the controversial explanations that Dr Shapiro is offered about the way it works. These explanations often ignore mainstream theories and provide complex explanations when there are simpler possibilities. 

00:21:50
DR. BESSEL In this particular slide, we see what comes online. 

00:21:55
NARRATOR Bessel van der Kolk, a professor of psychiatry had passed in university has conducted brain scans of trauma patients before and after receiving EMDR. These preliminary findings have shown that before the therapy, there is little if any activity in the area of the brain known as the Anterior Cingulate, which regulates the fear response. After treatment however, this area became activated, which according to van der Kolk indicates people improved. In addition, the left pre-frontal Cortex also became more active after treatment, suggesting that people were processing information in the present, rather than the past. 

00:22:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Director, Trauma Center, Boston It tells us that the treatment may actually alter some filtering system in the brain that helps people to interpret incoming information umm… as something belonging to the past as opposed to something that’s just happening right now. The… I think what we did not show here is, and it very important to guard against it, is that to show that EMDR, specifically does that. And so, it’s important not to jump to conclusions and also, we need to run many more subjects to make sure that your finding is indeed true. But it’s intriguing in that we are talking here about filtering systems and how therapy brings filtering systems online that helps people to distinguish between the past and the present. And only future researches can show whether EMDR does this uniquely or whether other treatments do as well. My conscious is that any good treatment would help to bring those filters online. 

00:23:30
Questions about EMDR What is the role of the eye movements? 

00:23:35
FRANCINE SHAPIRO And you just follow my finger with your eyes. 

00:23:40
NARRATOR Despite its name, EMDR is not limited to eye movements. It may also include other rhythmic motions or sounds, regardless of the form they take, Dr. Shapiro believes it is rhythmic patterns rather than the eye movements, that play a role in reprocessing the traumatic event. 

00:24:00
FRANCINE SHAPIRO It’s more than just eye movement, it’s a multi-faceted, complex method that brings in many aspects of all of the different modalities. And the way we prepare the client to work with the information, how we uh… suggest that they deal with the information as it arises, the way we use the procedural elements to bring in those different fragments of memory and hold them and contain them in a certain way the physical stimulation that we use, which is either the eye movements or the hand taps, or the auditory tones, it might be bilateral aspect of it or the rhythmical aspect of it, or the intentional aspects of it, but in some way it appears to catalyze that information processing system. 

00:24:45
LARRY E. BEUTLER It is argued by many that saccadic eye movements are by their nature outside of the awareness of the person who is having them. There are also, at least two possible explanations for the effects of EMDR that do not involve any special role of rhythmic motor movements, including eye movements or specific brain functions. One of these possibilities is that any form of distraction from the source of anxiety may induce change, given the right set of expectations. A second possibility is that EMDR simply is another way of exposing patients to the things that they fear. This latter explanation would suggest that the same effects as EMDR could be obtained simply by thinking about the events that are usually avoided and feared. 

00:25:30
KIM T. MUESER I don’t believe at this time that research consistently supports the role of either the eye movements or any other distracter techniques that are employed in EMDR. Early on, the role of eye movements was thought to be unique to EMDR, then alternative distraction tasks were employed such as listening to taping in the light. Those distraction techniques were found to be as effective as the use of eye movements, but other research exploring whether the use of any distracter is beneficial have not upheld the distraction technique as being useful. So, I believe that the eye movements and other distractions techniques have not yet been shown to be beneficial. 

00:26:15
FRANCINE SHAPIRO There are a lot of attempts to explain why the eye movement might have an effect and one of the ones that would suggest it was distraction. However, the research on distraction overall has shown that, that is really antithetical to treatment effects to any long-term effects. So, we have to umm… and also, anybody that’s observed an EMDR session or have been a client in one knows that they’re not being distracted from the event, they are actually able to access the event more. So even though, that’s been suggested it doesn’t seem to be a useful way of explaining it. We can say exposure is certainly a part of it, but exposure is really ubiquitous throughout their opinion. Client has to think of an event or they have to think of the situation in order to get any therapeutic effect. The difference in EMDR through the use of traditional way exposure is used in it, for instance, (inaudible ) is then instead of trying to hold the client to the most disturbing part of the event. They actually only hold that in mind possibly for not more than thirty seconds. 

00:27:15
LARRY E. BEUTLER It is interesting to note that Dr. Shapiro has admitted that despite such explanations, the eye movements may not be necessary to the therapy. And that she would, in fact, not include eye movements in the name of the therapy, if she were naming it now. She has argued quite persuasively and logically that the effects of EMDR are not the result of either simple exposure or distraction. But these logical arguments do not carry the weight of direct scientific evidence. There is yet to be specific research that compares EMDR to a simple exposure or a simple distraction treatment. Meanwhile, the controversies over complex, physiological explanations detract from the field and keep it from inspecting the accumulating evidence that EMDR is effective. And this draws attention away from initiating the much needed research on whether EMDR works as well as more accepted interventions that are not dependent on the validity of complex physiological mechanisms. 

00:28:25
Questions about EMDR How does EMDR compare with behavioral therapies for PTSD? 

00:28:30
TERENCE M. KEANE Well, in my view what’s interesting about EMDR is the various components of the treatment, which have been combined and consolidated and it does have some components of exposure therapy, it does have some components of cognitive substitution. It does very importantly include a subject of evaluation peace(ph) within the context of the exposure allowing an individual to rate their reactions physiologically. It also calls for people to focus on their internal bodily state where they’re feeling the anxiety something that is proved to be very efficient in the treatment of other kinds of anxiety, disorders across time. And so, each of these components may in that itself be an active ingredient that’s very helpful for people in managing their reactions to traumatic events. At the extent to which the eye movements will be helpful or any kind of lateral movement might be helpful is I think a very open empirical question. 

00:29:25
KIM T. MUESER Some of the things that we know from other research on the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder that can be beneficial include, teaching people strategies for managing those stress responses and the stress associated with these traumatic memories, helping people think about their traumatic memories differently, this is a technique sometimes called cognitive restructuring. Exposure techniques in which people are encouraged to confront both memories and actual situations related to traumatic experiences that they have been avoiding up until then. All of these techniques are used to some extent in EMDR, and so the fact the people have found EMDR to be beneficial and there certainly are some reports indicating that suggests that these other elements of cognitive behavior therapy could be what is helping people umm… who receive EMDR treatment. 

00:30:15
NARRATOR One issue that comes up when comparing EMDR with behavioral-based therapies for the treatment of PTSD is the rapidity of a fact. According to EMDR researchers, similar effects are achieved, but this occurs in fewer sessions with EMDR. One of these studies was conducted by Steven Marcus. 

00:30:35
STEVEN MARCUS , Ph.D. Clinical Psychologist Kaiser Permanente, Santa Clara, CA We found that uh… in the first three sessions, patients show dramatic improvement. We had 67 subjects in the study. And after three sessions about half of the EMDR subjects, no longer meant criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder according to the DSM3R. 

00:31:05
Questions about EMDR Are the outcome measures sufficient? 

00:31:10
LARRY E. BEUTLER EMDR uses subjective units of distress as a rating scale for evaluating the degree to which EMDR effects PTSD symptoms. Strict reviewers would rather have the research rely on less subjective, unobtrusive measures and more on solid evidence that there is a change in physiological responsivity.

KIM T. MUESER I think it’s important to look at subjective measures of distress because after all, the client is the consumer, the person who is distressed by memories and other after effects of traumatic experiences. From a research perspective, what becomes very important is not rely solely on these verbal reports of subjective distress. The main reason is that in a therapeutic situation in which there is an expectation on the therapist’s part of getting better, the client will often give information to the effect of trying to satisfy their therapists and to tell them, in fact that they have improved to a certain extent. From a research perspective, it’s important to combine subjective reports of benefits from therapy with independent evaluations done outside of the therapeutic context such as by having a person interview the client, who doesn’t know the client well, and may not even know whether the client has participated in a treatment for their post traumatic stress disorder or some other reaction following the traumatic event. Therefore, relying solely on subjective measures umm… is problematic because of these what are called demand characteristics, expectations that a client will respond a particular way.

NARRATOR Initial research on EMDR did not use blind independent assessment. In recent years, blind assessors have been used. However, some feel that there is a need for physiological assessments as well. 

00:33:00
LARRY E. BEUTLER The argument that research on EMDR must include physiological evidence of improvement, it seem somewhat suspect to me. The procedures endorsed by most prestigious methodologist for assessing treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders rely heavily on measures and types of data used in EMDR research, minimizing the importance of pyschophysiological recordings. The field has not adhered to a standard of using pyschophysiological measures as a test of treatment efficacy. And one should always keep in mind that in any therapy, the patient is both the initiator of treatment and its final judge.

Questions about EMDR What effect has treatment fidelity had on outcome? 

00:33:45
FRANCINE SHAPIRO How many of your clients won’t keep a log? Okay. Maybe, if they think you are asking him to write out war and peace. Here is an alternative. 

00:33:55
LARRY E. BEUTLER In terms of treatment fidelity, it has been the standard and randomized clinical trials research that the definition of compliance and fidelity has been left to the experts in the particular therapy. In fact, the original impetus for using randomized clinical trial methodologies in physiotherapy research was a need to ensure that therapists actually provided the treatment intended. This meant the therapists had to be trained to a criteria level performance defined by those who are expert in the treatment, in order to assure that the fidelity of the treatment was protected. Some researchers demonstrated that fidelity compliance measures are moderately to highly related with outcomes. Little attention has been given to what effect violations of treatment fidelity may have had on research outcomes. In the case of the EMDR, a good deal of the research has used therapists who have not been trained to any standard that’s acceptable to those who know the treatments best, experts in the field. In some cases, the fidelity with the treatment has been left to the opinions of those who are frankly antagonistic to the approach. This is not good science. Many academic methodologists have curiously failed to take Dr. Shapiro’s concerns with the importance of treatment fidelity seriously. I should also point out that although the data are very likely available to rate the fidelity of using EMDR across studies, none of those who criticized a treatment have come forward to volunteer to test this critical relationship between degree of treatment integrity and treatment outcomes.

Final Comments 

00:35:45
TERENCE M. KEANE The extent to which EMDR is better than other techniques is I think also a question that remains unanswered. We do know that there are very successful treatments for PTSD. They are tremendously successful techniques for treating rape related PTSD and sexual assault related PTSD. So the question is does EMDR, which has no basis in the scientific literature is, does that have something more to offer than these other techniques, which are soundly based. And that’s something that I think is… is really an open question at this point. 

00:36:20
LARRY E. BEUTLER More research needs to be done to give us a better picture of how well EMDR is working over time. There are questions of remained to be answered about whether there are physiological mechanisms involved and whether measurable changes in the brain do occur. The research today suggests that EMDR works for treating phobias and PTSD. In fact, there appeared to be many more supportive studies of EMDR than there are of other more widely accepted therapies. 

00:36:50
FRANCINE SHAPIRO I think that because the claims were so extraordinary, it had to raise eyebrows and a lot of skepticism because when you have been working to get rid of a problem like PTSD for years with so little effect, and then all of a sudden something new come along that no one has ever heard about, and we’re saying well, within one to three sessions, you can get these remarkable result. It just didn’t make any sense. So it became… it came from a vantage point of its too good to be true. And umm… it’s taken up till now, which have been ten years, since I first introduced it to have a number of controlled studies come along to show that, indeed the effects are there. 

00:37:25
SANDRA A. WILSON I think all of us are first response which you got to be kidding, um... you gonna do what, you know move your eyes immediate. And it takes a little while just to get sophisticated feelings about you know this whole process. Um, I think it takes just a real new thinking, it is, it is a new way of looking at on a internal healing process that we have never been aware of before. 

00:37:50
TERENCE M.KEANE If it is in historically very well and that context as something that is seemingly successful and perhaps even more successful than previously existing things. But the extent to which that will hold up and um... they are under very serious scrutiny is I think an open question at this point. 

00:38:05
LARRY E. BEUTLER I have a colleague who has explicitly rejected the claims of EMDR because the treatment lacks a conventionally understood rational. Its effects cannot be explained entirely by current theory. He has expressed a view one that's common among critics that effort could be better spend in studying treatments whose theories are better regarded and accepted. But to some myself included the very fact that EMDR produces results when by the most conventional theories that should not is extremely interesting. To understand results that consistently occur when they should not is the most provocative question in science. In history of science there have been some bizarre treatments. Most of these have been of no demonstrable value but some are proven to be effective even though we don’t know why. There’ve also been some treatments that didn’t work. When the best of theories said that they should. In truth a number of our most respected treatment approaches have much less and much poorer research foundations than EMDR.
