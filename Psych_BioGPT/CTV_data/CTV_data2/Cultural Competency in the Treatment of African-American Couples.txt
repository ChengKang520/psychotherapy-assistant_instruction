NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN  Good afternoon everybody. 

00:02:45
 Good afternoon. 

00:02:45
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN It is so nice to be preaching to the converted. A.J. and I (laughing) are thrilled to be here and very honored to be invited. Uh, it's also very special to us. We do a lot of work with couples but don't get to talk about it as often. We write about it, both of our, both, all of our books actually include a lot of information about it. Uhm, but it's not something we get to talk about a great deal. Obviously it's near and dear to our hearts. Uhm, I have to tell you though that uhm, when Bill, Uh, when Dr. Bill Parham invited to us uh, to come and speak, we were absolutely thrilled until we sat down and started preparing our presentation (laughs) and realized that we only had about 25 minutes each. So we're gonna try to clam a lifetime of work into 25 minutes each. Uhm, in order to do that, we're gonna talk today about cultural confidence in working with African American couples. And in order to collapse that into such a short time frame, we're gonna have to focus primarily on heterosexual couples. We recommend strongly, both of us have done work with gay and lesbian couples and we recommend to you uh, an article, a chapter that I did with Bev Greene uhm, a number of years ago in Joan Laird and Robert-Jay Greene's book on Lesbian and Gay, Couples and Families uhm, on African American Lesbian Couples. Uhm, but for today, we wanna focus really primarily on the challenges facing male-female relationships in the African American community. Now, I have to tell you at any Black conference, if you wanna pack, if you wanna fill a ballroom twice this size, you offer to speak on uhm, Black male-female relationships, that is one of the hottest and in some ways the most painful issues in our community. And I, that's really what we want to address as we lead into the discussion of the uhm, uh, clinical interventions. Uh, now, the way we've divided it, I'm gonna give you some background information and A.J. will present a case from his book. Uhm, we wanna cover a number of different areas and I wanna divide my presentation into three main areas. The first one being the notion of a couple embedded within an extended family and that is an extremely important dynamic for us to be aware of in our preparation. Uh, I'm gonna give an impassioned plea for more training in family systems and couples treatment for all of us who do multicultural work but I'll save that for last. 

00:05:50
 Yeah(ph). Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN Uh, the second issue that we wanna emphasize today and A.J.'s case will uhm, come back to it again is the impact of racism on the lives of African American men and women and couples. Uh, and finally I wanna talk a little bit about treatment interventions. A.J. timed me, I can do this if I rush in just under 25 minutes. So, we're gonna go for it. Uhm, African American couples are truly in a crisis in this country and many of us are not prepared frankly, to our training to do the work that needs to be done with this couples. A part of the challenge is that the notion of couplehood in the mental health field frequently makes African American couples invisible. Now, what do I mean by that? When I worked for many years before going to Rutgers at the Community Mental Health Center in Newark, we had a saying in case conferences that when cases were presented as single parent families, we said, "single parent until proven otherwise." Many of us are working with individuals and families that we think are single parent, when in fact, there is a viable couple relationship that is totally ignored by our field. So one of the things that we talk about in all of our books, and one of the things that we really want to get across today, is that couple does not mean married couple, alright? There are many different partnering relationships. Uhm, what we find in our work is that because of that lens, many of us in our clinical work don't reach out to the men in these families and that is an extremely important issue even if you're working with a woman individually in the African American community. It's one of our big concerns about lost opportunities in the multicultural field. The second issue though, that I really wanna spend a little bit of time on is the notion of a couple embedded within an extended family. And I think it's really unfortunate that many of us, for many of us because of our training, it's a stretch to even look at a couple rather than an individual. But the truth is, all African American couples and most Latino, Asian and Native American couples come with some form of a viable extended family. I should say viable and intrusive extended family, if the truth be know. (laughing) And so you're almost never in the room with just one or two people. In my book Black Families in Therapy there is a whole section on family therapy with one person. That is what A.J. and I do when we do individual treatment. Well, the truth is, when we see couples, we do family therapy with two people, alright? Because inevitably that construct is what's missing from so much of our training in looking at this work. So often, African American and frankly, all other ethnic minority groups come to treatment with family issues as if not the blatant referral questions certainly the sub-questions. But very often, because we don't know the questions to ask and we're not thinking with the family system's lens, we proceed to act as if the couple is all there is and that's almost never true. One of the uh, challenges in looking at uhm, African American couples is that in A.J. and my experience for example, we come with that complex extended family. We are a blended family, we have uh, stepchildren and children, we have complex extended families. Si, in many of our families, since you don't divorce uh, grandparents we also have extended families from other marriages in our extended family, or Christmas, Thanksgiving and family gatherings or an experience. You need a road map (laughing) to figure out who's who. But that's not unusual in African American families. The challenge is that for many, you've all heard I'm sure of the notion of the sandwich generation. Well, in African American families, it's like a, a mile long club, alright? (laughs) Because the, the complexity of our family systems mean that so many other people want a part of that process. How many of you remember a play from many years ago called River Niger, alright? Oh, this is that generation, okay. (laughs) River Niger talked about the complexity of African American family relationships and there was a, a, a line in it that A.J. and I remind each other of periodically was, everybody wants a piece of my toe, alright? That is an aspect of African American extended families and couples that we must bring into the treatment room. Uh, for many of us, we are caring for aging parents and grandparents, but we're also unlike many other cultures caring for aging stepparents, aunts, uncles. We're caring for other adults in our families who are not doing as well. We're caring for children, stepchildren, nieces, nephews and now grandchildren, alright? And so for many African American couples, that caregiver role is so central to our lives but it's not something that therapists are taught to ask about. One of the uhm, essential treatment interventions in working with African American individuals, couples and families is the use of the genogram or the family tree. How many of you use that in your work, alright? Please read Black Families In Therapy. We really give example after example of how those interventions are essential not just when you're working with the whole family, but even if you're working with an individual or couple, alright? And by the way, for those of you who uhm, used this in a more historic way, the truth is that for most African American families, these are not the past history, these are the people you talked too everyday, alright? A.J. and I struggle because we both have cellphones. Our entire extended family can reach us 24/7 and do, okay? And so that reality is something and working with our couples that you must look into. I'll tell you just a quick personal story. Uh, in by the way, for those of you who are thinking about, thinking about relationships, I really feel this was the most important ingredient in our uhm, success as a couple. When A.J. and I were first engage uhm, we went, we made a decision because our lives were so complex. We have extended family responsibilities on both sides, we had a ready made family, we're a blended family. So we went, during that period before we got married for pre-marital counseling, best investment we ever made in our lives. And the most important thing that we remember from that counseling is something that we've used a lot with the couples we work with. One of the things that uh, was very true for us then and is absolutely true for us now, was that so much of our extended family life came into our couplehood. And I remember vividly our therapist saying to us, "You know, you guys are getting flooded by all of the realities of your extended family. You need to prioritize your couplehood and make that the center or you won't have the energy to nurture each other and to nurture your entire families, alright?" Now, that's extremely important because many of us are trained to basically say, "You are the most important, forget those people." It doesn't work that way in extended family collectivistic cultures. Uhm, what we have found in our work is that the most important aspect of working with African American couples is to help them learn how to nurture each other. And I'm gonna come back to that because I feel that is absolutely central, but I'll address that again at the end. I wanna speak just a few minutes about the impact of racism and I wanna talk a little bit about racism and gender. Uh, in our experience, someday A.J. and I, when we retire are gonna, we're gonna write a book on Black couples. And part of the reason we're gonna write a book on couples is that what we found is that many of us in this field really do not understand the power dynamics and the gender roles in African American couples. Now, part of the reason for that is that we don't understand the impact of racism, alright? Now, many of us in the field are feminist, but African American women are very different from other feminist. Can I hear an amen on that? 

00:16:00
 Amen. 

00:16:00
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN We prioritize our feminism very differently from our White counterparts, alright? How many of you know the term "womanism," alright? Womanism is a term coined by many people but among them Alice Walker who talks about the notion of African American women prioritizing our feminism in terms of survival, but not such individual survival. Survival of our partnerships, survival of our families and survival of our race, alright? Uhm, we see sexism very much through the lens and the combination with racism. And that's something that is extremely important for those of us who do couple's treatment to be aware of. One of the challenges is that African American men no matter how prominent, no matter how educated, no matter how validated in their own workplace experience a reaction in society which as A.J. calls the invisibility syndrome. Now, I'll get to the invisibility of African American women in a moment but it's different. Part of the challenge is that no matter how successful an African American man becomes, he is still perceived and reacted through, to, through the lens of racism, alright? And fear, okay? The invisibility notion is a paradox. High skin colored visibility and gender lead society to treat African American men as if they are invisible and respond only to the stereotype. Now, this has major implications for couple relationships. Let me give you a personal example. In A.J.'s book from Brotherhood to Manhood, he describes the New York taxi experience. How many of you all have been to New York City, alright? So you know, that an African American man no matter how successful, no matter how handsome, no matter how su, you know, (laughing) prominent if he gets out on the uptown side of the street in New York City, he has never gonna get a taxi cab. Now, I want you to think about the complications in a couple relationship if a partner is a light-skinned African American woman and can walk out on that same street and get the taxi cab. Now stay with me folks, that creates a dynamic in African American couple relationships that we have not began to address as a field. Now, what's interesting is that that paradox leads African American women or leaves African American women in a tremendous double bind in our relationships, and that's one of the aspects I wanna address. Now, I wanna take just one moment and talk about how demeaning that invisibility is. Imagine for an African American man what it feels like to be demeaned in front of his partner, in front of his children, alright? In front of others in his world, okay? Uh, when A.J. goes to the store on Saturday morning, he doesn't wear this beautiful suit that he has on. He wears his Exco as jeans and he gets followed every single time. We've got in a conferences including our illustrious APA, where people, when he doesn't have his name tag on, there are people who won't get on the elevator with him, hello, alright? Now, that impacts couple dynamics and is that piece that we wanna go after. Now, I wanna take just a minute and talk with you about the state of African American couples in this country. How many of you are familiar with Tucker and Mitchell-Kernan's book on the Decline in Marriage Among African Americans, alright? Very important book because one of the things that we are seeing in the African American community uh, actually two things that they highlight, is the notion of the shortage of Black men, alright? Can I hear an amen? I hear the hmm mmms, alright? And the second issue and this is true across class lines, across socioeconomic level and of course, education is the unemployment chronic or serial and underemployment of African American men. The notion of last hired and first fired is still very, very much the issue whether one is waiting tables or a Ph.D. in Psychology. Now, stay with me. Uhm, one of the challenges in working with African American families and couples is to recognize that there are more Black men in prison than in college. That one out of three African American men particularly in the age group of 20 to 40 is under the care of the justice system whether in prison or on probation or in the process. Uh, the whole issue of mortality, alright? Across the life cycle, African American men are at risk at every stage in development, alright? Most don't live to collect social security, alright? I want you to imagine the impact of that on couples. The shortage of Black men creates a tremendous burden for African American women and a great deal of frustration to be very frank. Uh, many African American women in our culture that's so values partnership, that so values children and that so values families struggle with this issue of how to find a partner who matches them in their own culture and racial identity. So for many, many African American women, this challenge is enormous. This can lead some African American women to stay in very destructive relationships and that's something that we must look at and be aware of. The other issue in working with African American couples is that for many of us, the message is be strong. Now, I will tell you having supervise generations of multicultural psychologist. In working with African American couples you are inevitably going to have two strong people in the room. Most of our psychologist have no clue, alright? And so we have to do a better job in our schools of preparing psychologist to work with strong individuals in the treatment process. Imagine having A.J. and I as a couple in your office, alright? 

00:23:30
 Yeah. (laughs) 

00:23:30
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN Uhm, I also want to address, I'm getting the five minute signal from uhm, Dr. Bill. 

00:23:35
 Two minutes (inaudible ) 

00:23:39
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN  Two minutes? Okay, alright. Uhm, I want us to address some of the other burdens and challenges. One of the things A.J. and I use a great deal in working with African American couples is the notion of a racism reframe. What that means is helping couple see and you'll see this in the case that he's going to describe, the ways in which in many, many cases, African American couples find themselves in a situation where they all letting racism win with their fighting with each other over the manifestations of racism in their lives. And that's something we definitely address in the treatment process. The other issue is that from many African American couples, this notion of being strong is not the issue. The issue is how to be tender. Stay with me, alright? Because that is our challenge in working with African American couples to reframe tenderness as strength and not weakness. I wanna spend just a few minutes, I'm skipping half of my uh, lecture. But I wanna spend just a few minutes talking about the importance of helping African American couples create within their couplehood a safe space where they can "pull out the arrows of racism." A.J. and I are very aware of that in our own lives and often help African American couples to come there. One of the things we've discovered in questioning many couples over the years, is that many African American young couples have no models or role models for successful relationships. And so a part of our job in the treatment process is to help with that evolution. It means though that we have to have the skills in communication skill's training, in listening skills, in conflict resolution and in mirroring, so important to the couple's field if we are going to make a difference. Because of the healthy cultural suspicion in African American communities, the notion of coming to a stranger to talk about intimate couple relationships is almost unheard of. And so frequently, A.J. and I have had the experience of, how many of you all had ever, how many of you know Essence Magazine? Alright, periodically if you want him have an impact in the African American community forget books, forget scholarly journals, do an article for Essence Magazine. Periodically, A.J. and I did uhm, talked into doing a couples article for Essence Magazine. Now, what's interesting is we got tons of phone calls from women saying, "My partner and I wanna come in." We make the appointment, you could almost write the script, she calls that morning and says he won't come. Now, I'm gonna tell you something that goes counter to all of our couple and families training, "Tell her to come anyway, alright?" Because inevitably that is pawn to kingpin one in the process of engaging African American couples. Now, A.J. and I have developed the invisible dialogue. What you do is that you send home questions. You say, well what's the me, to go home and ask him what's the main thing he objects to in terms of therapy. She comes back the next week with about 20 minutes, alright? Then you say, "is it me or is it therapy, alright? Go back, you get another 20 minutes." If you keep that dialogue going over a number of week, you can then pick up the phone and call that other individual. Now, here's the catch. We are trained to talk to people about coming in. We're recommending that you talk to people about them, about their opinions, alright? Once you have them and their opinions you're far more likely to eventually have them, alright? Even, inevitably one of the challenges is that African-American men show up for a minute, alright? They drive their partner into the parking lot. Now, I'm gonna say something radical, alright? Get up out of your asses and go downstairs and meet the man because if you are waiting for him to come to you, you won't know this. If you're waiting for him to come to you, you're never gonna do couple's treatment, alright? I wrote a book called Reaching Out in Family Therapy. The subtext is home base school and community interventions. If the couple does not come to you, you may have to do something very radical like a home base session. Absolutely essential, time. Okay. Uhm, last point and this really is the last point. Uhm, A.J. and I feel very strongly that there is an area missing in some parts of our multicultural psychology training and that is that it is essential for those of us who work with individuals, couples, or families within the multicultural field. This is not just true of working with African-Americans. To have some training in couple and family therapy even if you only do it with one person, alright? For those in our training programs it is essential that this be a part of the training of every new psychologist appearing. For those of us who are over the hill and missed it in our own training, it is essential that this be a part of our continuing education and of our conferences because without it we miss the whole textured landscape of African-American couples. Thank you. (applause)
