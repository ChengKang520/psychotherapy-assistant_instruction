00:00:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER We are delighted to be with you for the next couple of hours to talk to you about group leadership, and not only to talk to you about it, but to do some very realistic demonstrations of not only what it's like to leader group but also to navigate through many of the most difficult challenges that group leaders often face as part of their experiences helping people to deal with personal issues and presenting complaints in the context of a group experience. 

00:00:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. What they're gonna see is a wide range of, of scenarios, we're gonna have examples of kind of new people who've never been in a group before, tackle some of their hopes and fears and what to expect, we're gonna have some experienced people who've lead in groups many, many times and talk about what they love about group and why they love it and what makes it in, in many ways the most exciting part of therapeutic work, at least I would say that, and I think Jeffrey said exactly... 

00:01:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER We could very sit still. We're so excited. 

00:01:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON All right. 

00:01:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:01:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, and there's also gonna be giving an actual group you get to see in terms of like kind of what a gro-- actual group looks like when they come together, the types and intensity of emotions they could expressed, also how group leaders work together, uhm, and then you see some examples in terms of kind of certain scenarios that we've pulled out. 

00:01:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Obviously, leading groups and helping people in group settings has, uhm, a number of distinct advantages and disadvantages. And one of the reasons that we're so excited about this modality and why we love doing this work is because we never know what to expect. 

00:01:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's true. 

00:01:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER It's always different. Uhm, we're always learning, we're always challenging ourselves. And even in what follows, I think it's safe to say that this was as much, ah, uhm, pretty incredible experience for us as it was for the participants in this video. 

00:02:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And I think the one of the things that we like about group is that it is so unpredictable. We don't know what's gonna happen, but you know something is going to happen. Uhm, and that's in, in a game, it's very fun as, as a leader, but as member I think that's what makes it really powerful in terms of the-- and therapeutic. And I think on, on that note... 

00:02:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Let's begin. 

00:02:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Roll the tape. 

00:02:25
Introduction to Group 

00:02:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What you're about to see is a demonstration of an actual group. Ah, what we have are seven group members who somewhat know each other, but, uhm, have them sat in a group together before. Uhm, we're asking them to kind of be themselves and be real. We wanna show you what actual group, group can look like. And it gets intense and gets real very, very, very quickly. They aren't talking about things that are fake or not true. These are actually their lives. And very, very quickly they get intertwined. 

00:02:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER And then we're also pleased that, uhm, we got a chance to, to actually witness so many of the process - 

00:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yup. 

00:03:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER - ah, components and dynamics of a group as well as for us to actually demonstrate quite a lot of, ah, leader behaviors that we'll talk about afterwards. 

00:03:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Exactly. And I think as you watch this, this group, be aware of kind of maybe places where you might intervene places where you're drawn to, uhm, were fully where that we did cover everything cuz there's actually so many opportunities in, in a group to address, but just be aware of the things that you're aware of, that you're attention goes, and kind of where if you're to go back and on, on subsequent group what would you explore and how. 

00:03:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER Is, uhm, is pleased as I am with the way things unfolded, ah, what I really like about our demonstration is I'm so sick and tired of watching demonstration sort of this perfectly orchestrated. 

00:03:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER And one of the things about leaning a group is a feeling so flooded with so many options. So we invite you as the viewers to really reflect on and think about things that you would have done differently, not only thing that you like that we did, but things that you didn't like, and that will be, ah, ah, of total avenue for further discussion. 

00:04:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Enjoy. 

00:04:10
Group Session 

00:04:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Everyone, uhm, we've met four times and I'm glad everyone is here today and we're gonna go round and do, do a check in. 

00:04:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER We would just like you to check in with whatever is present for you today or, uhm, whatever has happened that you wanna show with us since the last time we've met. 

00:04:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Who want to go first? 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Oh, yes, I'll check in. Uhm, since we've met last week, uhm, I went and saw my father for the first time in nearly 5 years. 

00:05:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Ah, we, we haven't been on speaking terms and so it's, uhm, it brought up a lot and it is kinda like I'm still kinda feeling a lot of resistance. You'd look a lot like my dad. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uh-hmm. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN And I'm like trying to remind myself that you're not my dad but I kind of feel a little uncomfortable right now with you. So... 

00:05:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER Well, thank you so much for, for sharing that. I know that was, that was difficult for you and I have felt some of the tension between us and I haven't really known what that was about. 

00:05:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there might be something you wanna talk about and get more today cuz it's too early wearing it. Okay. 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, for me, ah, I do went on personal therapy along with this group and I think it's-- I mean, it has cause a lot of positive changes which is great and, and I'm happy about that. But at the same time, uhm, it's really to reevaluate the relationships that I have with friends and family and, uhm, ah, distance myself in people that I think aren't very good for my life but then I feel guilty doing that. And, uhm, it's really difficult to explain to them why and, uhm, it's like I feel really alone and you know, the new connections I'm trying to make are wonderful at the same time they're so new so it's not the same. Uhm, and I kind of relate a little bit to the family dynamic. My dad just recently moved, uhm, like a 5-hour drive, for me it's close to it, being across the country. So now he, he wants the closer relationship and I don't think I can give that to him. So that's going on right now. 

00:06:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN So that's like that right now. 

00:06:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Well, I'm gonna check in next. I'm going through something very similar that you're going through so I totally relating with you right now. Uhm, by going through the master's program in counseling in this group I'm starting to shift my relationships also so I'm grieving the loss of some friends that I don't feel are good for me anymore cuz I've changed and then I'm not settled in with the new friends yet so I'm feeling a little lonely and isolated too. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER And that's a theme that we've heard throughout on our time together, in almost every session that some of you have shared then. 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, so I'll check in. As you see, I have a big boot on my foot. Uhm, I broke it and right now I'm just kind of having a hard time. I have to ask for help cuz I need help a lot of time and I'm just having a hard time doing that and it just, as I've said before on previous groups, you know, my mom raised me to be this independent woman and that to rely on me and I kind of feel like that's what's happening and just like the cultural stuff and my, my cultural stuff, it's just clashing right now so I'm just having a hard time. So, yeah. 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN They're really related to what you guys said earlier about, uhm, feeling isolated. As you guys know like I... 

00:08:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER You know, could you speak a little louder because I'm noticing I'm hearing construction sounds in our, in our, uhm, agency, they're doing some renovations. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Sure, sure. Yeah. Uhm, yeah, as I've talking about the past few weeks like I'm just been really down and feeling disconnected for my spirituality, just every aspect of my life I'm feeling I'm just getting up in the morning and I feel like a machine every single day and, uhm, I know that a big component of that is not being connected spiritually the way that I was before and I'm feeling like I can't really talk to anybody about that because I don't know anybody who relates with spiritually the way that I do. Uhm, so it's just-- that's been something that's been really difficult for me and it's just-- and to come here and sit with you, guys, it's just-- there's just as any guide to talk about now. 

00:09:40
[sil.] 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN Well, I'll check in. I'm kinda still going through the same thing as we talked about with our previous, ah, sessions together and so having that, that fear and, ah, kind of sense of confusion, being that concealed to, ah, parents who've lost their sons, same as just me with the same disability, uhm, that we've kind of encountered, so, ah... 

00:10:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER When you say seeing-- I mean, you're seeing in counseling yourself. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:10:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER They are your clients. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Right. Yes. 

00:10:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And that's kind of your center of anxiety and fears. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Uhm, I guess I'll check in. Uhm, I'm not really feeling very well today, uhm, and I know talk to a little bit about another groups kind of how they set expectations for other people and how I kind of set expectations for myself, uhm, and I think today was a perfect example of how, you know, I didn't wanna disappoint everyone. Uhm, I kind of force myself to come because I didn't wanna let you raise down. Uhm, you know, and sacrifice kind of my own, my own needs. Uhm, so I'm trying, I'm trying something that I've been, ah, struggling with, I guess. 

00:11:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So you're aware that's what you have right now that you kind of you're working honest playing off right now in the section being in that. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, and it's, uhm, really interesting kind of mani-- how it's manifesting, uhm, right now that, you know, I relate with some of the things that you guys mentioned. Uhm, yeah, and I think it's-- it really touches on some of my own, own things as well. 

00:11:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. I think everyone has raised in it. Just some kind of on client kind of things we've talked out in the previous weeks in terms of connecting and disconnecting and obligated, uhm, and, and depending on people. I'm not sure where we wanna start with or where, where we wanna go. 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN I just-- I'm, I'm really struggling because, uhm, I know the reason I'm feeling more anxious this week is because I'm getting closer to this guy that I've been dating and it's, it's been difficult cuz he has a different cultural background than, uhm, I'm from and he's not really connected spiritually and I feel like, you know, this is first thing, it derail me further or, uhm, or is he the one for me cuz I feel really attracted to him, I feel like he has all the-- uhm, embodies all the qualities I've been looking for in a gentleman and-- so I'm just experiencing out loud an internal conflict about that. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I know what you mean. Uhm, for me like I'm so much different than when I was younger. You know, I would set these standards of people that I would date. You know, I, I have said that I-- you know, if this person isn't a Christian like me then I could never with him - 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN And, uhm, and with my family values and with what I'm raised with, I always-- my hand-- and then-- but then when I came out as a little being, I felt like my bones are really strange in that arena and, uhm, I felt judgment from both sides on that. And, uhm, I'm dealing now who is actually kind of the same boat as me raised with, with Christian values which is nice because we just both don't talk about it too much. Uhm, so now I'm kind of just here to bring it up because you know I feel like I'm finally really connecting to someone depending to bring that up because of disconnecting, it's scary. 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, like you have just wanted to winning it. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Okay, that's look like it. 

00:14:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sometimes there's a desire on wanting to connect with the people that also relies with the connection and at least some disconnection on yourself and, and that's true, uhm, trying on ways to bring those things together, ah, what's close to yourself, what you believe and also close to the person who, who embodies these beliefs. Who could relate to that? 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think that really touches on some of them. You guys are used to expectations because you know, I think my expectations were highly connected with people have really evolved. Uhm, you know, my standards were how to engage, how significantly it shifted and I, I do have a hard time connecting with people and I, I yearn for this connection. And it's-- you know, you know, you guys have talked about it previously cuz I know what it's been like dating and all of that and I know it does feel like, like it gets harder and harder from here because we have standards for ourselves now that have changed. So, uhm, roughly right there with regards to that. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER So one of the things that a number of you are talking about and that you, you were also part of your check in isn't just related to the relationship with a partner or dating relationship, but it's an awareness of the ways that you've changed a lot, uhm, not only during the course of our group, but during the course of, uhm, this journey that you've, you've been on for the last couple of years, and whether it's changing friends or whether it's re-- renegotiating things with your boyfriend now that you have independent in ways or whether it's trying to reconnect with your father, or all, all of the-- those issues it's, uhm, you're describing in a lot of different ways the, the destabilization and the uncertainty and the confusion and the renegotiation that's taking place in, in your lives and how exciting that is, but also how uncomfortable that is. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. I think for me it's more I'm so much more aware of what's going on. Uhm, I don't think if I wasn't in support I'm not so aware of what I am so frustrated. Uhm, and it's kind of like how to explain it to my boyfriend like it's, it's just my mom raised me to be this way and at the same time she raised me to have this maximum traditional beliefs and his family is very traditional and maximum in. Now I'm kind of falling into his like traditional beliefs and it's like, well, I'm taking care of my, my, you know, of my partner and I'm just-- I'm kind of pushing him away right now and it's, it's hard. Uhm, and I feel bad. So right now I'm just trying hard. You know, it's just really hard telling just to accepting this help but it's, it's just kind of causing conflict between us. So I think this program, it's good and bad in a way. Sorry. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN That's okay. It's like growing pains and then suddenly just feeling scrambling and all, these things that are changing and working through. You wanna take people that you love most with you and then at the same time you feel like if you do you don't have enough to group on yourself. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN And you get scared of losing the people that you love the most as you're changing. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN Maybe that's a part I'm more scared of, it's losing him. And I'm trying to work it all out and I can't. So, yeah, just breaking my input. It's maybe realizing all this stuff. 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's all you could said with all the crisis and just to really come in to, to, to the end and what you're aware of is the only one you kind of view with him but also really on that. I think on both sides of that. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN I think you're kinda doing good. I was trying to do that and which is I'm trying to grab and take it all with me but then I realize that if they are meant to come with me, or follow me. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN And then guys I think that I-- cuz I feel like having in me too and I feel like it still is going on and I think for me that's helped me to kind of get through that hope and just kind of seeing each relationship in a different way that some relationships kinda offer the certain kinds of support and then that there's still-- that each one has its limitations with that day. You know, we can't-- I can't beat all of them and said to them the way that I want to engage with this person, with this person. So I really seem to value that each relationship holds and its, its differences. So-- and I know it's a bit hard. 

00:19:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Damian(ph), you were nodding your head. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Right. Uhm, tough like and kind of same with what he said in the way of fulfilling that loss and, uhm, and I think that has been-- something that's been replaying in my life, ah, of seeing people that have the same problem that I have early and, uhm, just making it really kind of luck he said that after, ah, kind of breaking your, your ankle and, and then now that maybe the circumstance, ah, that can reveal these, these relationships and just kind of doing the same things, just making aware of my relationship with my wife and the family and, uhm, just this whole fear that's just kind of in stuck there that is usually for myself, ah, being pressured and, and spiritual. Uhm, that's not necessarily what I'm going with the fear, my wife, and that's gonna happened at her and the family and so... 

00:20:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's within the house that impact to you, you know, on daily basis and you'd think you're aware of this and you represent and if possible so we could trigger house's impact in relationship that trigger and... 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN It's possible when we're in this day. 

00:20:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Uhm, and I don't like that. It's really strange in my relationship and even with my family. And I guess, things-- this is when I solve from them cuz I'm taking on at least emotional dealings and, ah, afraid of being open and telling what's really going on. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER And what's really going on? 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN I'm confused. You know, I'm-- I don't know how much time I have. 

00:21:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON How is it like, you know, to say that in this group here? 

00:21:15
UNKNOWN It's the first time I said that and had it out. Yeah. That's absurd. It's exciting. 

00:21:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what's it like for a person in a group to hear Damian(ph) say that? 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN I think for me I just thought, like, wow, you're so brave. But it also kind of, uhm, just triggered a little something you need to just, uhm-- that's like something you had along could say as you guys knowing that she passed away from cancer and that's just, uhm, I've heard you say that before. So-- and I just thought my mom was the previous person in the world looks like coming here and just that, just-- you know, it takes a lot of courage. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm really glad that you shared it cuz that I feel a little more connected to you, you know. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Than I did before and I have some autoimmune diseases and you know, I would often wonder the same thing, I don't know how much time I have because of that, if my life is gonna get-- got short. And so I'm just, just really feeling it, yeah. And I feel like I'm really breathing for a little while and I actually really know any of that before. And so, uhm, it does me to feel closer to you and at the same time I can't even imagine that feeling. You know, for me it-- it's more so that I think about my grandmother who is my mom and I don't think she has much time left and there are certain things that I thought about of like things I really want her to be part of that I'm sure that she won't be-- I can't even imagine thinking about my own time that is terrifying. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN You know, and-- you know, you talked a little bit about how, you know, you kind of distance yourself because you're kind of afraid and you know, and all of that, and I, I did wanna just acknowledge that and maybe that's, that's kind of a step towards moving towards getting that support and you know, uhm, letting us be there for you and, uhm, just kind of honored to come in and witness that. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER And it just strikes me is just another example of your amazing courage. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:23:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER And the things that you share in the-- earlier about your combat experience in Middle East and try to metabolize and make sense of all, of all of that and, uhm, and try to get on with your life in such a way that you, ah, in which your relationships and started feeling crippled by everything that you experienced in the Middle East and everything that you've been trying to, to make sense of and, ah, it's just amazing what you're carrying in your shoulders. 

00:24:20
PAUL Uhm, I kind of-- I don't know, I guess I was kind of felt a little bit uneasy with you on group. Uhm, maybe because I didn't feel like I really know who-- knew you were. You know, and, uhm, I don't know, I guess seeing you take a little bit of the restrain, you know, just determining a lot of the restrain now help me feel more, ah, safe. I don't know, I don't know that's the word I'm able to say. Uhm, I guess you were always kind of the-- better than an enigma to me. And for me and my life, quiet means you know, I need to be afraid because, uhm, in my life and then my father would be quiet and then also, that's all, and, uhm... 

00:25:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And that's part of what you've been afraid of in our relationship as well that, uhm, when will I going to come in my face or something like that, you interpret that as, as critical judgment in some way or that, uhm, I might lash out at you the way older have in, in your life. 

00:25:55
PAUL I am. You know, I guess, it's just that it's always a, a fear of not really knowing where I stand with you, with you, you. I, I mean, it's, it's-- you know, I think it's-- I don't know. I've kind of always consider myself kind of a sensitive guy and, ah, just-- it's never been safe for me to be that person. And I just thought I feel like I'm holding back a lot in this group, you could say that. I just, I just don't know how to get passed that feeling I have right now of, uhm, being into like go and, and trust and not feel afraid. I have this strong desire to connect with you. 

00:27:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know inquire you the type of that before that there's a lot going on. I think that you don't always talk about but I think just in the past 5 minutes you could kind of take that and acknowledge kind of what you're wearing in terms depending on your room and seeing that Damian(ph) that, that is being open with you is along to kind of speak without that fear, uhm, cuz I think if you talk tomorrow I think you're going through an hour that you've past 4 weeks look like you're much more in touch with it. 

00:27:30
PAUL And it's, and it's sort of because you know, I can't simply talk about, you know, you know, the kind of traditional roles and I wanted her, you know, her-- first of all, I want to take care of her. You know, I grew up in a very, you know, traditional ruler house. My father who's you know, the powerful one and you know, we followed his, you know, his, uhm, lead and uhm, my mom was very same as him and I guess I started to-- I almost feel like I wanna get protective of you if you start to talk about, uhm, you know, following those traditional rules and like all these flags are working, no, you don't, you don't do it. You know. Uhm, and it's weird because I, I kind of feel like all of the things that we're talking about are all connecting in me to one thing and I'm not sure what that one thing is, but I feel this is like it's right and it has I think it really does have to do with, with-- I think it's about traditional rules and for me traditional rules is a bad thing. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, it's a, it's a-- it's been a negative thing in my life. 

00:28:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER And that what, what you're doing now, in fact, what you've been doing the whole session is it is taking risks that is getting outside your, your comfort zone and, uhm, you know, the way thing has started off like yours, and things about yourself that are, that are really difficult and, uhm, and, and you started as going on this conversation because of the risks involved in, uhm, the scary parts about your new relationship, the scary parts about what's involved and what you have to give up of yourself or what you might have to train in terms of your spiritual release that you've kind of defined as being somewhat unique and personal for you. 

00:29:40
JESSICA I really wanna thank both of you guys for speaking up. Uhm, and we're kind of on that note. You know, it has been kind of hard as a woman being in this group, uhm, with like he said two pretty quiet man not to mention two, two of our leaders. You know, sometimes they feel like we get carried away with girl talk and I'm like, I don't wanna leave the guys out, you know, but then I don't know what you guys wanna talk about, if you do-- you know, if you're even listening. You know, kind of using that, just kind of, you know, telling your story and they don't, they don't care and they don't see sometimes when you guys are quiet. It's, it's a little, uhm-- for me, it can be perceived as my own judgment because just kind of-- that's what my interaction have been like so, uhm, I really appreciate you guys bring that to the table without me having to say it, you know, in this sort of confrontation, uhm, and kind of take it at some-- the same insight to what you're-- both of your experience is something like so... 

00:30:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sounds like it's a restraint for you to like you're missing really like, you feel like the obligation towards the people to talk to them and, and protect them and make sure you respond in a way but when they're at least pick up and be honest with you then it freeze in some ways you just, they always stand with you. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The kind of your smile. 

00:31:05
JESSICA I just-- yeah, I just, uhm, I think that really captured, you know, what we've got to the expectation just, uhm, yeah, there was a little, little much to hear that to really have someone acknowledge how that is. I don't like it. I don't wanna think about it. So, so, yeah. 

00:31:35
CYNTHIA You know, for me, it just feels actually kinda nice to see you vulnerable. You know, I don't really know you very well except that you're a crew, uhm, and to me I just kind of always see you as, ah, to me it's like you're just a perfect student, a perfect everything, and... 

00:31:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Just perfect notes. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Yes. She's perfect notes. And, ah, for me it's just-- I feel a lot closer to you and I-- I've got to-- I've got like you like me a little bit and that's really nice. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Sure of that. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I completely agree. Uhm, you know, you, you present yourself in such a way that I would have no idea. You know, I-- you know, for me I feel like I, I wear my emotions obviously on face so easily and people can just tell when I'm having a really hard time and it's been really difficult for me for a while, but then to know that, that you're having a hard time too make's feel less alone. So I really appreciate you sharing that because I do admire you, ah, you as a friend and as a fellow student. So to know that you're struggling too, I mean, even though it sucks to struggling, at the same time I mean I'm not struggling alone. 

00:32:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER So that you feel okay now. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN You know, it's really nice because, uhm, I don't like it, I get really concerned about taking care of other people, you know, even when Damian(ph) was saying that. I wasn't-- say, I wanted to make sure, to acknowledge how brave he was and all that. You know, it's like it's just my natural instinct to, to acknowledge and validate people. You know, so I think it is-- it's, it's-- it feels really lonely, you know, and you guys talk about that if like all I wanna do is comfort you guys and say that it's gonna be okay, you know, while I'm here like, you know, I'll be okay meanwhile, you know, so, uhm, I-- it's really nice to hear it that I can still connect with people while being vulnerable and that connection doesn't have to equate to taking care of people, uhm, and that, yeah, it's, ah, it's really mind-blowing right now. So, uhm, I didn't expect this, the truth is that I didn't wanna be here. But I really appreciate everyone's support. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Just go with what you've just said really spark something for me like I, I know you pretty well I think and, and, uhm, but still I haven't experienced you being this vulnerable, uhm, I think ever and, and I appreciate you opening up and, you know, as I have been mentioning over the past few weeks, like that, just being, uhm, in a really dark place myself and, uhm, I had just been feeling that I wanna reach out and I've been feeling really isolated cuz I feel like I'm the only going through this. Uhm, but-- I-- you just made me realize that one of the reasons why I don't reach out is because I don't step into that rule. Like, if I'm not fully present with myself, how can I protect the others, and I don't want others to protect me in any way, shape, or form. So it just like really spark something for me as you were talking about that, that like I've been isolating people in my life that really care for me because I feel like if I can't protect them, then I can't have them in my life. 

00:35:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER So like so many others here you're an expert to taking care of other people but it's really hard for you to other people. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Take care of me. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER Take care of you. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER And we're used to be so strong and we're used to being the ones in charge and the ones that help others that it's really hard to allow people to take care of us as well. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Just going with you, I, I guess I'd always felt like a difficult to connect with you. Uhm, I couldn't relate kind of your perfectness. Uhm, ah... 

00:35:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER Did I mention her nose? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Uhm, and it's weird because when, when you-- I guess what I realized were about more something than I realized because for you that's how you keep safe, like you know, being perfect, that's how you stay safe, that's how you know that people are gonna like you and that you're gonna be okay and that maybe your family is gonna be okay with you. And for me, I have that same fear of like, how do I please these people that are impossible to plea-- you know, that are impossible to please. And I actually have to have the exact opposite direction like we're rebelling and because of that pressure. And... 

00:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The feeling is in a sense is you can't make it perfect. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Right. Exactly. I just-- you know, uhm, so I guess on that one I was-- I almost felt like, well, there-- you know, which word just, you know, kind of products of the same thing but on opposite ends, you know. So... 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN And you've nailed it. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN So, yeah, I mean, I re-- I really appreciate everything you speak about because it's-- it, it really interesting because I don't know how this image of me ever got created. You know, like there is-- I've heard that before, but I think I, I don't know what it is, and, uhm, there's a lot of isolation and protection, uhm, ah, even especially when it's been tried from someone that I don't even know where it's from, I don't even know how they're talking, but like no, you know, so, uhm, just being here with everyone and let it-- having everyone that mean to their, their causes, there's a privilege in myself. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, we need to move into check out. 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, uhm, we'd thought we check out made by going around and everything this person just talked about kind, kind of one thing that they're, they're talking today, uhm, that it's something that really extends out to them. 

00:37:55
[sil.] 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN I just have to say the interaction between you guys, it really-- it was an eye opening for me because you said that you relate to her because she's really coming-- she's stepping into what it is a perfectionist tool but you're feeling more defeated and you're overacting and it just hit me but that's what's kind of trigger something for me 4 months ago when I experienced something which I thought was relatively small. But ever since then I just felt completely defeated and just have been embodying that anywhere with me. It's like becoming myself for that part. So it's like I wanna be defeated so I don't have to be defeated. So... 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Just listening to what is inside. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, that was really a major for me. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN I know I'm supposed to be checking out, but, uhm, I think that sometimes, you know, you talked about feeling like distanced from your spirituality, but that's for me because I actually feel closer to you, ah, and sometimes I feel, feel like that spirituality was a, a defense that you leave behind, uhm, and I-- again, it went back to that, that perfection type of thing and then I had trouble relating to, but when you're saying that, you know, that-- you know, I don't know if you like you hurt me. Yeah, so I, I do feel closer. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN You know, I'll check out because, uhm, I think just kind of hearing Paul(ph) said those things to me and just, you know, I can even you are here, I can feel my guards immediately like thinking about how do I, how do I comfort them? How do I protect them? Like, how do I let Paul(ph) know that it's okay, and, and all of that. So, uhm, I think the only thing that I can really offer that is, uhm, I mean, and then we keep going back to it, but I think the ultimate data we talked about is, is sense of connection. 

00:40:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uh-hmm. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, and I do cuz so much more connected to both of you and all of you. Uhm, just like hearing your experience and that its kind, uhm, and that I don't think it comfort you guys. And, they can thank you guys for, for, uhm, offering the-- that's, ah, uhm, feeling unfamiliar feeling of really uncomfortable but, uhm, I can really feel just that energy from both of you guys. Yeah, so. 

00:40:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uncomfortable but you like it and you wanna a lot-- more of that in your life? 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, if I don't get you scare right away, (inaudible ) perfection. 

00:41:07
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But, but let's just take someone has an obligation, I mean, that obligation but before we came here for them, that's why you're here today. That's what we're leaving today for you. Right? We're here for you. 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN I'll, I'll check out. Uhm, I definitely had a lot, uhm, new counseling, uhm, definitely he and, and, and Jessica(ph), kind of in that role of, I feel like the same way taking care of other people - 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN - but I'm not necessarily taking care of myself. And, ah, just the whole the dynamic of me kind of opening up to you guys and, and felt relieving and just the importance of being more open with, with more people. And, ah, kinda what you're saying for how people-- I have this, this person, that people know it's not really me and like you see the funny side, you see the, the quiet side or the professional side but not really me. And so just being more open and, ah, I'm glad that you guys be a part of my life. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN All right, it feels a more real check out. Uhm, I've take on both the role of perfectionist and of, you know, the defeated, half mask person. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN You think so. I love you too. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN And, ah, ah, I have hard time really being with-- by completely being myself. 

00:42:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN You know, and it's like, you know, which am I today? And so, sharing and talking about this issue feel a little more comfortable to really just be me. You know, and just-- like the genius and the stuff that I've been through, there's a couple of people that I have-- that are really just can't be myself and it's so wonderful, same time, it's terrifying. So to talk about that, that make really-- hope you also realize that. I do still put on you know, that face sometimes, and no one-- you know, I need to start wondering why I do that. Uhm, cuz it really as nice to just be yourself but sometimes scary. So I felt like I'm being myself more with you guys. 

00:43:35
CYNTHIA Ah, it feel so crazy anymore. It's kinda hard to go right now cuz I have all these internal complex just clashing and now I just-- now that I've actually like to talk about, I just come to realize, yeah, it's just me having a hard time. I'm still used to taking care of everybody else than when it comes to people taking care of me. I, I don't know how to do it except all this-- done it for myself. So I just kinda felt like, oh, my god I'm going crazy cuz it's just running through my head. So, I just wanna thank you guys for like letting me vent, kind of figuring it out by just saying it out loud. Thank you guys. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN I'll check out. Uhm, living today today with feeling less alone. 

00:44:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Ah, for sure of that. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN I'm the only person that is making these adjustments and having losses in their life. But I'm also feeling hopeful because I thought the losses are gonna be unhealthy relationships. People that can't commit sort of deeper level of me but there's people in, and in this group and there will be more people in other situations going forward that are able to connect on a deeper level. But-- so, thank you guys for sharing everything that you deal with me today that helped. 

00:45:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Now, I'm just thinking out, as, as we end here that this group has really worked really hard in the past 4 weeks. That we're starting with this idea when we connect much, much more real kind of relationships. And kind of building that base but following it to-- by following it the thoughts in our heart than it is people out that we're going to let each other in a lot more. And today is (inaudible ) I feel like were kinda had a lot closer as a group. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Thank you all for joining us today. 

00:45:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Thank you. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:35
Debriefing of Group Session 

00:45:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER So Matt, uhm, we just finished, ah, leading that group together. 

00:45:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:45:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER What, what are some of your initial impressions? 

00:45:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah, but first of all I thought it was, it was pretty intense. And I think it, it, it's the reminder for me of just, ah, you know, it doesn't really matter in this, this group in 40 minutes, 45 minutes went to-- some very deep places and there's idea that, that, uhm, you can go to these places in group. Like, uhm, I mean, sitting in a room with the members and yourself, uhm, it was powerful. I mean, I could feel the pain and people's experiences and see the tears in their eyes. And I think that part was, was really kinda cool. How about yourself? 

00:46:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah, I also appreciated that many of the issues that came out of the group, you know, we talked one of the principles of group. The curative factor is the university-- universality of experience. 

00:46:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And I love the way that some of the issues that came out - 

00:46:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:46:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER - are those that would relate most directly to the people watching the video. 

00:46:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Exactly. 

00:46:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER You know, that resonating with those same themes of, uhm, the ways that their relationships are changing - 

00:46:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER - as a result of learning to be concern of therapist. 

00:46:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Absolutely. 

00:46:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, the, you know, the, the issues, uhm, polls issue with authority - 

00:46:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yup. 

00:46:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER - and the ways that, uhm, we have these complicated reactions to people that are in positions of power and authority in our lives. 

00:47:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right, right, right. 

00:47:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER That we call our instructions and teachers, and supervisors, and how they remind us of other relations on our lives. 

00:47:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:47:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, so many of the other issues that, ah, that were brought up. And one of the really magical things to me is the connections that the people and the group made with each other. 

00:47:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:47:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, and, you know, this weren't show on the video but what we heard and saw afterwards, the kind of debriefing they did with each other where they're reporting that you know, many of them have been in therapy for years. And yet that 45 minutes seemed to be seminal - 

00:47:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Worry about them, yeah. 

00:47:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER - for now in terms of putting some things together. 

00:47:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, and I think you're right. I think that that's good thing to be-- that I like too is that, you know, you don't-- in any group, you don't know what's gonna happen. You have no idea what's actually gonna come out. And people may say, I wanna talk about this thing, and they're check in. And that's-- not where we go. But I think in this, again, there's this theme about connection, disconnection that every single person kinda, kinda touched on. And then, you found that connection with each other and, and then it played out for a rise. And, ah... 

00:48:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER We could spend, uhm, time talking about all the things that we did really well, uhm, cuz it was, ah, pretty successful session. And yet, I'm always intrigued, uhm, with the ways the co-leaders can help each other - 

00:48:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's right. 

00:48:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER - to, to learn from, from that time. I'm especially interested in things about that session that we might have done differently or - 

00:48:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:48:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER - could have done differently or anything that you've noticed to observe with regard to that. 

00:48:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I mean, that's a, that's a good point. I mean I think that, you know, again any group there's so many places that we could go, and, uhm, you know, we got a short setting. And you know, we didn't necessarily go, you know, didn't comment on a group that we might go deeper, two or three people over 90-minute period. Uhm, we didn't really have opportunity so that was somewhat-- I think for me, you know, I was really drawn towards Damian(ph) when he was talking about his you know, his experience working with, with parents who have similar illness that he has. And I'm not sure if it's because I was sitting right across from him, you know, but I got a really good look in his eyes and I could see that you know, what he was talking about was really, really meaningful. And then he said that as well and it seem like in some ways may be that, uhm, I think the group jumps in really quick kinda support him. And I'm thinking, it made an interesting to come-- give Damain(ph) a bit more depth to explore what that meant or what makes them sit in the room. 

00:49:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. I, I also you know, when he mentioned the health issue, I wasn't sure what he was refrained to and assume that you do. 

00:49:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:49:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And, yeah, and, and but I had wanted to follow up on that. 

00:49:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:49:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER And ask more of that. And I, as I'm sitting there in group not only with respect to Damian(ph), I just-- I get so distracted at times because pardon me, as with him. And then I catch something out of the corner of my eye, cuz I was watching Paul(ph) and I was watching other people. You know, we-- how long do we stay with them? When do we go to the, you know, back. I try to go back to headier at one point and it felt somewhat forced ar-- artificial - 

00:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:50:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER - ah, the way that happened it was-- it came-- it was a great idea but it felt more abrupt than I wanted it to be. 

00:50:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. I think and it's funny. I think this is gonna be an example of, of, you know, groups can be intense. And they can be-- and we have an example in that group of seven people who are willing to go in places. You know, and sometimes you're kinda pulling teeth to get someone to do something. 

00:50:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And some of them les-- they were all ready to go right away, and accessing kind of their affect and kind deeper states. And, and the illness on-- I feel he's on us then to organize that a bit more. 

00:50:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:50:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So maybe that's the place where if I would look back again it's like, you know, we maybe could have organized that a little bit more, uhm, to give some people like may be some deeper experiences around that. But, uhm, uhm, but it's something like to me and would consider them to be pretty functional. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:50:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm. 

00:50:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER I sometimes wonder if it even matters, you know, we-- when we have this conversations afterwards about what we could have done but there's so many other issues - 

00:51:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER - and interactions that we could have followed up on that we didn't. 

00:51:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, and to any come to mind for you cuz I-- I'm thinking about like we got a little bit into the men stuff. 

00:51:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER About men don't really express themselves - 

00:51:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:51:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER - the way you two guys, and I thought, "Oh, you know, we could there." 

00:51:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:51:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER And then it drifted, went somewhere else. 

00:51:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:51:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER And I wonder should we bring it back there. And yeah, when we're done and we go over all the things, I wondered, does it really matter? Does it make any difference? And on the one hand, of course it does. And on the other hand, where did the group goes? 

00:51:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER You know, where it goes? 

00:51:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And it, it seems prevent to have present profitable enterprise no matter what happens. 

00:51:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I, I think that's kinda true is that despite our intentions or plans if we were to plan next about our-- within 5 minutes it's out the window. It doesn't really matter anyway. You can't script it, you can never cheat, cheat it on your arm. 

00:51:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:51:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It's not gonna go that way. I, I do think that it's-- it is a group a like that with, with two co-leaders who are male, and two man who are also are able to speak their own experiences. I mean, you do have to kinda watch that aspect on hand not having the kind of male or boy who is to be dominant in the room. Uhm, yet the same time I think other members of the group were also interested in kinda saying what this like when these, these guys interact like. But I think that what we have to watch, but you know. 

00:52:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER So if the group were gonna-- going to continue and we're gonna meet for the next session, ah, quote, unquote fifth session. 

00:52:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:52:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER Where-- what would we plan that we would end up doing? 

00:52:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, knowing what to do, anyway what we do. 

00:52:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:52:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER Because, ah, you know, as we know the planning to care of our own anxiety than it is because we actually think we're gonna do it. 

00:52:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well, there's something, you know, I said there's something about, you know, we did the check out at the end. And, you know, I'm, I'm kind of two schools were on check out, say I like them in some ways because it creates kinda, kinda closure to the group. But I don't like sometimes is that, it's opportunity for someone to kinda drop something. 

00:53:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER Okay. 

00:53:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And we can't process it. And I think you know, and I think Kelly(ph) I don't think she drops something as opposed to shut this awareness. Like, oh, my gosh, this is happening to me, I'm aware of it. But we can't go there now. So now, were, were-- the next 6 days and 20, 20, 27-- 22 hours we're waiting here what's going on. And so I ha-- my father has been-- you have to come back to that and see what's going on, what feel so fresh but yet it's not fresh we co-- you know, yeah. 

00:53:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah, and yet, you know, one of the dis-- differences between working in groups versus individual sessions is that most of the work takes place outside the group. 

00:53:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:53:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER I mean because people get so little time. 

00:53:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:53:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And so little attention. You know, what we hope to do is prompt them and encourage them and stimulate them. And then they go out in the world and they do stuff and - 

00:53:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, you know. 

00:53:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER - come back, so, you know, in, in-- I was kind of really moved and delighted by what happened at the very end. 

00:53:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I know, I know. 

00:53:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Implicitly, if not explicitly several of them said that they had some - 

00:54:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Real experience. 

00:54:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER - real experiences and specific things they intended to do. And I'd be really shocked and surprised if by the next session we didn't hear some may be even dramatic rapport, some, some. 

00:54:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, absolutely. 

00:54:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:54:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, you know. The only thing I was thinking out with that example of the group two is that, you know, we, we talk about this as, as teachers whatnot that, you know, we'll see the things happening in people's lives outside the group, coming into the room and play out. And I think that was such a traumatic example today of, of, of Jessica(ph), letting it, say, here's my issue as that I'm-- I don't wanna be here but I'm here because of you. Hey, and that's my issue. And then that plays out in the room and she gets real feedback about it in vivo, and I think that's powerful and then, and then Cynthia(ph) comes in wearing out-- ah, walking cast and we don't know she was never walking cast and she comes in and she's just want anybody to take care of her. And yet she's sitting there, people wanna take care of her. You know, and then be involved all of these things, you're gonna be in the room. Uhm, and again, another reason why, you know, group so powerful. 

00:55:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER And finally I-- our last, ah, point I'd like to race is some, you know, when we talk about why we love group so much. 

00:55:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:55:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, it's not only what happened during the session itself but even what's happening right now - 

00:55:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right now. 

00:55:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER - with us. 

00:55:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:55:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER That, uhm, it very much feels like being parents. 

00:55:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Co-parents together, and that we can debrief each other. And that we can give each other feedback. 

00:55:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Absolutely. 

00:55:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, there's no other way in my life professionally that I grow more and learn more than I do when you and I have these conversations - 

00:55:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER - after we've worked together. 

00:55:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I completely agree when we talk about idea that the group members are we-- in a relation to each other. But we're in a relation to, to each other too. 

00:55:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:55:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And, uhm, you know, that's the cool thing about group two, as it's so nice to have this wonderful experience. And then I have someone who I can process with - 

00:55:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:55:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON - and talk about it. Who I know will give me, give me strength if I need it. And also give me feedback if I needed too, and say that, cuz we already missed, missed each other. And, ah, and that's, again that's the promise of group two. 

00:56:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:56:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah. 

00:56:05
[sil.] 

00:56:05
Specialized Group Leadership Skills in Action In this section, Jeffrey and Matt have identified specific group leadership skills they wish to draw out and highlight. Beginning a Group 

00:56:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON There's also a scenario in which we're showing kinda what the first group looks like. Now, in reality the first group will be ma-- much longer with this going over group rules and expectations. We just want to show you kind of a really brief way of how you like certain group. 

00:56:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And even in this really, really short introduction, we're trying to introduce some of the most important values and attitudes. And to set them up that there's some amazing things that are gonna happen in this group if they're open to them, unfolding. 

00:56:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Exactly. 

00:56:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It's not first group, and, ah, and first time meeting everybody. And we thought, we'd start our group just like talking a bit about kinda with-- can expect here and what potential could be, uhm, by, being in a group. Uhm, you've got a chance and talk with each of you before and give an idea what you're bringing in, uhm, but we wanna to get a sense of kinda, again, we're talking about your introductions and who you are, and if you wanna get. But we thought, we talk a bit kind of, uhm, group, and why it's useful and, uhm, the most important thing is the chance for you to come in here and be yourself. And to be honest with each other, uhm, to work on, on your relationships and things you'd like, you'd like to see in your life. And talk that into place where you maybe have some unique outcomes. In a sense that, there might not be a lot of places in your life where you can get truly, honest feedback from people. Uhm, and the promise of a group like this is that at some point in this group, you'll have the opportunity to ask people how they experience you, how they feel about you. And in turn, you all have a chance to both get and-- get feed-- feedback also give feedback, back, back to each other. 

00:58:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER We're also aware during the separate interviews that we have with you that you're all chose to be in this group for a different reason. You're all working on, uhm, different issues in your lives, related relationships, related to career aspirations, related to coming to terms with things in past or about plans you can have for the future. And we really have no group goal, uhm, except to help every single one of you reach you individual goals. And what's so remarkable about this opportunity that we have together which is really different from individual counseling is that we have all the collective support and all the collective minds and wisdom of your experience that were, were bringing to this. So, although Matt and I have a lot of experience running groups and we've worked together for a while, uhm, we're hopeful and really excited that this is gonna be a place, this will be the place where you can talk about some of the most important, significant things in yourself and do so in a way that you feel safe, and you feel respected, and you feel loved, and you feel supported. 

00:59:15
Redirecting (and Co-Leaders Talking with Each Other) 

00:59:20
UNKNOWN So, uhm, yeah, it's, it's really good thing that I haven't really told in one-- but you guys and, it's too big deal for me. 

00:59:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

00:59:30
PAUL I can really relate to you right now, like what you said, it's kinda really making me think about what I've been going through and, and I don't know, I guess I just I feel I'm connected to you right now and I gonna, kinda want to-- I'm trying to put words to, you know, what I'm feeling, but, uhm, I don't know, it impacted me hard, uhm. 

01:00:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER I wonder, Paul(ph) if we could talk some more about that, uhm, how you been impacted just now. But then I'm concern we just left Damian(ph) hanging and that maybe it be good to help Damian(ph) to, to finish his talk back then and then probably we could come back to you. 

01:00:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And this time there's two things right now I think that, that both of you are pretty intense. I mean based on what you said, but I'm, I am concern, uhm, about that shift, Paul if we can shift away from. You know, also excite earlier about on looking in and open your life. You take charge and we will not lose your about, about your counseling then that one make sure doesn't feel like that. Two, uhm, why don't we shift them back to Damian(ph) and then we could come back to you afterwards. 

01:00:40
PAUL Okay. 

01:00:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:00:40
PAUL Yeah. 

01:00:40
DAMIAN Ah, yeah, uhm, it's, it's really hard, uhm, I feel alone but I'm not alone in this, in this group, uhm... 

01:00:55
Soliciting Feedback 

01:01:00
JEFFREY KOTTLER So had you-- I, I was really struck by something that you said in the group today that some really familiar to me and that's the number of times that I've heard you say that you're different from other people that your experience is different, that your spiritual beliefs are different, that what you suffered in your life is different, the places you'd live, the things that you'd had to go through I frequently hear you talk about that you're different. And every time you do that, every time you say that, "It feels like it's another barrier that I can't possibly cross. That I could never understand you. That I could never get through to you because we're so different." And I'm not sure if that's just my experience or whether others of you are feeling that as well. But I wonder if you might like some feedback on what that sounds like you feel like to other people. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean that's really powerful I definitely, uhm, becoming more (inaudible ) about how I just feel I never belong in any situation. Uhm, so, yeah, if, if I could get some feedback about that I would be really helpful. 

01:02:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON All right. Are you aware of what you wanna know of what people in terms want you give you feedback on and... 

01:02:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I think since I struggle mot-- most about that feeling of belonging - 

01:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:02:25
UNKNOWN It's something that's impressive throughout my entire life. I think maybe ways that they feel I've had to belong. Or that, they don't feel that I'm different, ah, I think that would be. 

01:02:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this idea if kinda-- if you-- if people express you as, as being, ah, affective that if you do belong with your moments much take, don't feel like different instead you feel like closeness and stuff. Okay. Is there anybody in particular who you wanna hear from do you think that can give you that feedback. 

01:02:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Ah, maybe you could pick three people on the group who you think would be well either tell you something that you don't know or three people that you would trust to be really, really arms with you. So you didn't just hear the yearbook, uhm, "You're so sweet don't ever change." 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN Uhm, definitely Jessica(ph) and Paul(ph), it can four. And Cynthia(ph) and Ginger(ph). I think you guys probably pretty well and interacted quite a bit together. 

01:03:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:03:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And you also pick them because you trust them to be really honest with you. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:03:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER Okay. That you're strong enough to handle that. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:03:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER Okay. 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN Ah, you know, how are you for me, I think the times, uhm, there's been times in group work kinda like hesitant just continue on, ah, just because you are so positive, you know, I think Paul(ph) mentioned earlier in your spiritual-- your spirituality is just, you know, it's so important to you, uhm, but at the same time I feel like that it's kinda kept to me from completely connecting with you but the times that I do connect with you or when you're vulnerable and you're honest and I feel like when you're just being you. Like you were earlier today when, uhm, you shared about like, "Wow! That was so significant, you know, those are the times that I feel like I really honest to connect with you more. 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:04:35
PAUL I think I can-- cannot figure out that I, I don't think you're as different as you and you think you are, you know, I think that, uhm, that-- well I can say that I feel the desire to connect with people and then much like if I'm doing it. And, uhm, not feeling like, you know, if people are not going through to exact same expense I'm having, ah,-- then how can they, they po-- possibility relate-- how can they possibly relate to me. And, uhm, I just-- you know, I think that you are more connected by anything just because I don't have the exact same brand of spirituality that you do. 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:05:20
PAUL Uhm, that I think at the corner you want the same things that I do. And, uhm, yeah... 

01:05:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER So, you're maybe saying in Pearl(ph) that you're not as different as you think you are. 

01:05:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think really did the anxiety you express about sharing, you know, about your struggle to spiritually and, and feeling like there is anyone that would be able to completely understand that. Uhm, I mean I hesitated before to share certain things that I didn't feel like I'll be different, but then-- I mean my experience is, ah, about this, when you share things that you don't think people could understand or relate too I found that I really do relate to you and get closer to you. Appreciate when you share that, uhm, you know, it's not as different that I'm like it's certainly good to that feeling to you that, ah, you know, let's gonna understand but then I do receive understanding and I hope that you felt that way from us. Ah, you know, yeah, not, not be same spiritual, uhm, you know, area but I can really relate to that, uhm, thank God you share cuz it's something that I've tried to not think about. And you really brought it (inaudible ) for me. 

01:06:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER What would you like to react to? 

01:06:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON (inaudible ). 

01:06:43
JEFFREY KOTTLER Oh, sorry. 

01:06:45
JESSICA It's okay. Uhm, I think for us, you know, we've gotten through a lot and, ah, I think the one time that we always go back to is that one sleep over like our big test and we just hang out on our bed and hang out with my dogs, uhm, you know what I think about that moment because I know it was really special for you. And I learned, uhm,-- and, I, I as I kinda recall like what was it about that, that was so special. You know, as my grandma making attempting to make gluten with eggs cuz she didn't know what a gluten was and everything has soy sauce you didn't know to make anything. You know, and I think a lot of it was, uhm, that there was no worry about being different or just kind of thing. It was you were, you were, you were teaching me about your life, you know, you were telling me about your experiences and you weren't afraid to acknowledge that they were different. You know, that, yeah, I don't need (inaudible ) but it wasn't that we're so different. You that you, you taught me and my grandma how that you good and free. You know, and I think those were the moments of connection that, uhm, help you to really producing without anxiety and that you can remind yourself of that, that it's like, "Yeah, it's okay that it's different." But if you're willing to let us in so share that with you, uhm, then that's what I think helps you to what it seems like has helped us to really put that aside. 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN When I think about that time we had a sleep over like I just would come over me as there's a feeling of safety. I just felt so safe there and taking care and it was okay with being taking care. I just let that door down that it's okay that you taking care of. Yeah. It's just-- it was so healing for me, you know, and I still-- and I'm like whenever I'm having a bad deal I still think about that but then also makes me sad, I'm like, what's change, you know. Why am I not being open the way that I use to be I am so afraid. 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN I think, uhm,-- you know, I think, ah, Jeffrey about it a good point about some of these for instance, you know, because, uhm, it is something that I've kinda been afraid to, to plan. Like you do, it feels like a wall that I'm scared to penetrate. I don't know how, you know, and I don't wanna shake you either and be like, you-- you're, you're so guarded, you know, cuz I feel like that just makes you guarded even more. Uhm, so kinda bring this up in the safest way possible to acknowledge how phenomenal it is when we do connect in that way. Uhm, you know, what it is like for you to put your guard and to know that, you know, feel about hold your hand. 

01:09:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER So also pointing out to, to disconnect doing the way you are in presenting yourself which is this powerful strong take change woman and yet you make so many statements about yourself, about, you know, what a basket case that you feel like a lot of time and I, I know that how you actually feel. Uhm, but it's so different from open way that you present to the world cuz you do come across as so powerful. And look at all the heads nodding. 

01:10:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:10:05
Roleplay 

01:10:10
UNKNOWN You know, you guys are all right, I, I mean, I really appreciate everyone's feedback on, on feeling (inaudible ) though it doesn't, I feel a lot better, thank you. 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I just kinda, wanted to check in with Paul(ph), uhm, you know, you, you look kinda down, and, uhm, I can't help but notice since you know, when Damian(ph) had barred up and Jeffrey had kind of said something to you. It's just since then you've been-- I don't if it's because of that but, uhm, I just want to see how you were, you were doing. 

01:10:45
PAUL Yeah, honestly, that kind of really triggered me. 

01:10:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:10:55
PAUL Like I-- I'm kinda angry like about you stopping me like that, it just totally made me feel like I was that kid again, that was you know, being told to shut up. And, you what-- you have to say doesn't matter. 

01:11:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:11:05
PAUL And I just-- I know that, that's not what you meant but it's tough. 

01:11:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER But it felt that way to you. 

01:11:15
PAUL Yeah. 

01:11:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it just sounds like your, your in, in-- and sometimes is aware of kind of that need we had to kind of move and yet another kind of level it feels like it's rejection again. 

01:11:25
PAUL Yeah. 

01:11:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:11:25
PAUL I mean, I, I'm not trying to make this all about me but you know, it, it, it did trigger me. 

01:11:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So... 

01:11:30
PAUL And I-- and I'm having trouble. I, I don't know if I can be in this group right now because I'm feeling that you know, that, that way towards you. 

01:11:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER So, forgetting about it being, uhm, like sensing yourself that its-- without any judgment what, what would you like to say to me that's the kind of thing that you'd hold back? That you wouldn't say to somebody in authority figure an older male. 

01:11:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Or your dad. 

01:11:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Whether it's logical or not, but just what do you just say to me what you're holding inside that you wish you could say without fear that I'm gonna be hurt. 

01:12:10
PAUL That's hard, it's hard because you know, it's, uhm. 

01:12:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The fear still there. 

01:12:15
PAUL It is there. Uhm. 

01:12:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is there anything that, that, that the group or Jeffrey could do to kinda help you feel it-- most supported and safe in doing that? 

01:12:30
PAUL I really don't know, I'm like-- I-- it's probably just one of those sense where I gotta just do it and, uhm, see if I could say it without, you know. 

01:12:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Figure out. 

01:12:45
PAUL I, I felt, ah, this discounted when you do that. 

01:12:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:12:55
PAUL And, uhm, I mean I know you're a group leader, ah, but it really just-- I felt, uhm, like I didn't matter. 

01:13:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:13:10
PAUL Yeah, uhm, and it made me angry and hurt. 

01:13:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Wow. I mean, wow that you would say that to me. And how hard that must be for you to say that to me. 

01:13:30
PAUL Yeah. 

01:13:35
JEFFREY KOTTLER And so your fear in being honest and expressing your anger to me is that what would happen now. 

01:13:40
PAUL Honestly I, I feel like you probably not gonna relate to me and... 

01:13:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER Yeah. 

01:13:45
PAUL And be able to complete-- you probably going to, uhm, I was having a negative feeling towards me - 

01:13:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uh-hmm. 

01:13:55
PAUL - for the rest of our groups. 

01:13:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER And punish you in some way. 

01:13:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great Paul(ph), you're really honest in terms of your feelings. So wonder if we can kinda have Jeffrey respond to that, you know, would that be okay? 

01:14:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER So, my reaction Paul(ph) is the opposite of what you might imagine that, yeah, I'm a little uncomfortable. And I, I feel little bit defensive inside and I, uhm, my first reaction is to, you know, apologize and to explain and defend myself about what I was doing and why. And that only last a few seconds. And then what I feel is just so much respect for you that you could say that to me knowing how hard that was for you. And knowing some other things that you've talked about before. And I feel closer to you now than I've ever felt because you could say that to me. So I'm actually incredibly appreciative. 

01:14:50
[sil.] 

01:14:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON (inaudible ). What do you want? 

01:15:00
PAUL That's what I always thought that my dad would say to me or something like that and... 

01:15:05
[sil.] 

01:15:10
PAUL Thank you. 

01:15:15
Managing Conflict 

01:15:20
UNKNOWN You know, I just-- I guess I had-- how sad to say to this. I just-- last week, ah, I just go like, I talked about my mom you know, she's hurt me a lot and it was really difficult to share. And I just felt like you are defending my mom and not supporting me. And that was just really-- I just, I just-- haven't been able to stop thinking about it. You know, and I'm be able to like look at you at thing, you know, it just like, when I look at you now, I just see you as like this defender of my mother and not someone that's my friend or this-- a peer and it's just having a great difficult time sitting here right now. 

01:16:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You've been working this over the past week sounds like and coming in today. 

01:16:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean I'm just, I'm just trying to say that it's not about, it's not about Jessica(ph), ah, just-- haven't been able to, to work through it? 

01:16:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER Do you wanna respond? 

01:16:25
JESSICA Yeah, I mean, honestly I'm little caught off guard and, uhm, to be frank I'm actually little offended. Uhm, I mean, I'm your friend and I would think that you would know better than that. I mean, I don't mean something like not know better than that but I just-- I feel kinda hurt that you would even accuse me of defending your mom cuz I know that it's a sensitive subject for you. So, I mean. 

01:16:50
UNKNOWN Ah, and just, you might be very sensitive about it all, I mean, ha-- how am I supposed to, to know better I don't even-- what you mean by that, right. 

01:17:00
JESSICA I mean, it's like were, were friends and you, you know I'd listen to you and I'm listening to you all the time and it's just like, you know the one time that actually try to say something that's not what I normally saying. All of a sudden, I'm the defender of your mom, it's like, you know, and to bring it up in front of everybody it's, it's a little bit, uhm. 

01:17:20
JEFFREY KOTTLER You feel like ambushed. 

01:17:20
JESSICA Yeah, I feel like I'm put on the spot a little bit like... 

01:17:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER And yet this is like one of the few times in our group that we've had-- when you've had to-- when anyone in the group is really have the courage. Uhm, Paul(ph) I know that you've confronted me but we've been you know, really careful with each other and you've kind of take the things to a, a different level of, ah, in some way different level of intimacy to be able to, to say what you really feel and think that you've been, you've been holding back. So, I-- we'll give you a chance to process this but I'm wondering what the rest of you are hearing or seeing, or observing in this interaction between the two of them? Is that what came Matt? 

01:18:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, from the... 

01:18:10
UNKNOWN It just seems to me that, uhm, this what I'm observing. I don't think that Ginger(ph) and tell me if I'm wrong. I don't think that you're accusing her. I just think that as friend she would expect you to be more validating. Uhm, in that situation where she's feeling vulnerable. I think that was kind of what she's doing you know. She's like, I expect you to support me and be there for me. I-- it wasn't time to take and object those stance. 

01:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I thought (inaudible ) of where right now and just like sitting here in the room. 

01:18:40
PAUL You know, I'm calm, I'm ca-- I feel very tense like I have some-- yeah, I mean, you know, I, I kind of feel like you know, I e-- I feel for you like the-- it, it, it feels like you're kind of being attacked right now. And I don't know, I just kinda wonder if would, ah, better brought up between the two of you elsewhere. I don't know. It just mean, maybe I'm just uncomfortable with, with you know, conflict cuz I-- you know, I was starting to feel kinda close to you guys and... 

01:19:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER And it feels like you have to choose sides - 

01:19:10
PAUL Yeah. 

01:19:10
JEFFREY KOTTLER - between which absolutely... 

01:19:15
PAUL Yeah. 

01:19:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I saw you're nodding. 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's like I don't wanna say anything cuz I'm afraid that, you know, one might get mad at me. I don't wanna choose sides. So but I feel the tension. I just kinda wanna back away from it. 

01:19:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I won't mean to you guys because since it happened in group and I bought it up here, I'm, ah, it just-- I didn't feel safe in here anymore. 

01:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It, it sounds like last week this has happened and then you wanted a certain kind of reaction in the group and sounds like there's a big discomfort between you and Jessica(ph) you've wanted something else, hope there's something else. 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN I think there's-- at this, I mean at this time, miscommunication between the two and, ah, I'm seeing both sides. And, uhm, both sides are hurt, I, I definitely can see that but being that, uhm, previous sessions we kinda talked about being intimate. And, ah, I can definitely agree with the intimacy that's, that's happening right now. Uhm, despite, uhm, you kinda being shocked that I shouldn't say in the scene like, ah, she's telling you this and, ah, she's opening her intimacy to another level which is pretty amazing. 

01:20:40
JEFFREY KOTTLER So Jessica(ph) you, you felt misunderstood and you're a little misunderstood. I wonder if you might try again and say what you really wanted to, to get through that apparently wasn't got through the way you wanted to, to express yourself. 

01:21:00
JESSICA Uhm, I mean I guess, I guess I just feel, I feel put on, put on like this spot you know, and, uhm, I guess it's, it's hard for me because you know, I've talked about this before. I try so hard to make sure that everyone's okay. Uhm, and to have all of a sudden my good intentions be misinterpreted. You know, and I guess, I guess I kind of see that it's a little bit of my own, uhm, things I need to work on but I think it's just still, uhm, it's all of-- I think given the setting where everyone's kinda looking at me like I did something, like I feel like I do need to defend myself. Uhm, but I can see where you're coming from and I, I would just hope that you can see, uhm, that I'm reacting to kind of my, I don't know, yeah. 

01:21:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So were (inaudible ) your own stuff like it triggers part of you that wants to make sure everyone's around just taking care and okay. Uhm, so you were at that piece but also since, also sometimes you wanna go back-- that brings back you with, with, the change or two. 

01:22:10
JESSICA Yeah, I'm trying here, so. 

01:22:15
JEFFREY KOTTLER Give you a break. 

01:22:15
JESSICA Yeah. 

01:22:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And like-- what change your mind? 

01:22:20
UNKNOWN For me like, ah, you know, what you really said, I think you're right in the sense that it's my own you know, feelings being triggered and yours-- it is sometimes may be what I should have said is, kinda told you last week instead of holding onto it is that sometimes I don't wanna be made to feel better cuz the situation that isn't gonna make me feel better. And sometimes, I just wanna feel like you've hurt and understood what I've said. And I know that you, you mean well. I guess sometimes you need to try to make me feel better because it makes me feel worse. 

01:23:00
JESSICA Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. 

01:23:05
Ending a Group 

01:23:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON We've had an example here of showing how, how group can this well. There are many ways in which, which you can end a group, and which is the last group meeting. And we-- we're giving an example in terms of how group members might begin to talk about, about saying goodbye. 

01:23:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER And you'll notice in particular about how we hit pretty hard. One of the challenges and disadvantages of a group is that one's its ends, their greatest fear is that the effects aren't last, that they're gonna relapse, that they're-- whatever changes they've, they've made without an ongoing support aren't gonna last and that's a, a real fear that we address pretty directly. 

01:23:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, and it's something and, and that start when you-- one member says that it-- any of the group is bittersweet, and we often find that, that exactly is true. That many members are glad that the group is over, they've done their work, but it is sad. It is sad because they're saying goodbye to people who they care about and, and work that they're doing and may be work that's not exactly finished. 

01:24:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So here we are at our last group. And we've done a lot of work of or with the many, many weeks that you've been here. And we thought we'd end by just having had chance to check out in, in a big way and talk about what your gains were like, and what your word of us as, as we close. Anyone can go first? 

01:24:20
CYNTHIA Well, part of me is just worried because I feel like this was the only place I could be real in and, uhm, I'm just scared that once I'm out there, that all this stuff is gonna go away, and I'm not gonna know how to be with people. 

01:24:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:24:40
CYNTHIA Uhm, so I think that's just what's running through my head I kinda don't want it to end. 

01:24:45
JEFFREY KOTTLER And thanks for saying that, cuz it's totally legitimate fear that, you know, one of the disadvantages of group experience is that you have this kind of unreal world, and... 

01:24:55
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:24:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Uhm, it ends, and now what happens? Now, these-- all these precious gains that you made, what happens now that we're not meeting every week? 

01:25:05
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:25:05
JEFFREY KOTTLER So thank you for mentioning that. 

01:25:10
UNKNOWN And I felt the same way, I mean, I mean I we-- exchange numbers and plan to hang out together but, uhm, my pa-- previous experience is just been just that, that last for very short amount of time and then it just goes away. And then, I feel this is, yeah, first of all I really felt genuine in a really long time and I don't want that to go away. I mean, yeah, I feel like I've grown a lot and I know that will stay with me and I'll always be appreciative of that. So I guess that's the one way that I feel a little bit better about it is to know that even if this connections don't last forever in a way they will. 

01:25:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's just worried that somehow what that created in here is not really faded out once were done. 

01:25:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:25:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:25:55
PAUL Kinda feeling a little bit different like what I'm worried is that-- I just feel like there's a lot of unresolved stuff that, that we talked about. I, for example, I, I didn't feel like I ever got to hear enough for more and, and now like group's ending. 

01:26:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:26:15
PAUL And, just, I don't know, I just kinda feel like, I don't wanna stop because it, I don't feel like we're really finished. I don't know how to explain that. 

01:26:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER And like you just explain it really like every aspect of why if you accept that it's unfinished. And were left to kind of complete the group and the group continuous to live in our lives. Uhm, even though we won't be meeting for every week. 

01:26:45
UNKNOWN And this is just been an eye opening experience for me. It's multitude of levels like how, how do you behave in group is exactly how I am in my life. And, uhm, I really didn't think it was possible for us to get so vulnerable and so close in such, ah, short period of time. And it's really actually made me motivated to seek out other kind of group, uhm, sessions, and, uhm, make it a part of my life. You know, this is definitely been a healing force (inaudible ). So, yeah... 

01:27:25
JEFFREY KOTTLER So the, the meetings and that the group doesn't end. 

01:27:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:27:30
JEFFREY KOTTLER The group continuous. 

01:27:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But it also sound like you're aware of the change that's happened in you, and that desire for deeper connection. 

01:27:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:27:40
UNKNOWN I kind of agree, uhm, gives many positive changes that I made in my life because of group and it doesn't stop here. 

01:27:50
JEFFREY KOTTLER Could say that again? 

01:27:55
UNKNOWN Ah. 

01:27:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER Louder. 

01:27:55
JEFFREY KOTTLER I really agree there's many positive changes in my life that's taken place because of this group and that we guy didn't stop here. 

01:28:05
[sil.] 

01:28:10
JESSICA I can actually relate with the bittersweet feeling. Uhm, it's something pretty, pretty sad, uhm, to the ending specially with the unfinished business that, uhm, I had to reflect back to you when Jeffrey had said in the first session you know, to work on individuals goals. 

01:28:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:28:25
JESSICA And, uhm, I feel like in a way as kind look at who I am now, uhm, I, I've accomplished them in terms not fix all my problems but I had hope, uhm, that I can. And I don't feel like as helpless anymore. And I feel empowered, uhm, and that's something that you guys were all able to witness and, uhm, that's a feeling that you know, we're always carrying throughout without any sort of endeavor. So thank you. 

01:29:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What you're about to see is an example of a pre-group screening. Now, a pre-group screening is exactly what it sounds like which is the opportunity to, to see people before they actually join your group. Now, when you're in the field you realize that this, don't know it's happened. If you do scree-- a screening it takes time. So imagine that you're in a group and you'd like to have eight people in the group. That means at the minimum, you're gonna have eight screenings. You may not actually find the first day people fit. So you might have another one and another one before you know it, you might have 14 or 15 screenings before you find your actual eight people. And that can take time, it can take money. Uhm, there's a log time that occurs as well sometimes between the screenings and group actually starts. And sometimes in the field, the group just needs to start. However, if you don't do a screening, and you're picking eight people. The first day people would show up, then you're stuck with, the first day people who show up, regardless whether or not they actually fit for, for your group. A pre-group screening usually has its three main goals. 

01:29:55
Interviewer learns about the candidates interpersonal behavior 2. Interviewer tries to analyze the compatibility of the candidate and the goals for the group 3. Interviewer tries to assist the candidate in the learning about the group by presenting the goals of the group, the processes, and the rules Pre-Group Screening Preparation for Candidate 

01:29:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The first goal is that the interviewer is trying to learn about the candidates in a personal behavior. In the second goal, the interviewer is trying to analyze the compatibility between the candidate the-- and the goals for the second group, group emission and the group calls itself. And the third goal is that the interviewer is trying to assist the candidate and learning about the group by presenting the goals of the group, the processes, and the rules. If the candidate looks like a good, good fit for the group, the screening can then move on to two additional preparation goals. 

01:30:25
1. Give candidate an accurate picture of what is going to happen in group 2. Creating group member behavior before candidate gets into the group 

01:30:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON The first goal is pretty important which is giving the candidate an accurate picture of what's gonna happen in the group. And the second goal is actually creating kinda group member behavior before they get into the group such as learn how to ask for, ask for and give back, being honest, taking risk, being non-offensive. That's gonna be supportive of the actual goals of the group. If you wanna create an effective group, what you're trying to do is this screening is to clarify any misconceptions about the group, any fears or un-- unrealistic expectations. I'm also gonna try to provide the client with some type of structure that helps with being in the group. So I'll talk to the candidate about-- through and the personal frame of the group and that leads to inform allies in the group. So they know kinda what to expect from each other. And of course, I'm gonna try to generate some realistic and positive ec-- expectations about being in that group. Of course, the bottom line is that good group preparation leads to good groups. 

01:31:20
Good group preparation leads to good groups Benefits to Pre-Group Screening 1. Decreased drop-out rate 2. Approve attendance 3. Greater incidence for group members to achieve their goals 

01:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And research has been very clear about it-- this, that there are three kinda main, main benefits of, of a group screening. The first one which is really important is that there's decreased drop-out rate. Two, is the approve attendance, people actually show up more often. And three, if there's a greater incidence of a type of behaviors that move group members towards their goals. In just a moment you're gonna see as an example of, of a pre-group screening. In this example, there's a candidate whose, whose coming in, who would like to be in the group. In that group, well my job is to kinda figure out, kinda, is she gonna be a good fit. Someone who knows exactly kind of, what is she bringing in? Uhm, she still have, ah, ah, some type of, of concern that she brings in. And I'm gonna try to frame that in an interpersonal way. So we have an interpersonal group. And so one of the, the-- if you wanna be in the group, you have to have an interpersonal concern. So simple way of asking this is when people a-- people talk about kinda why they're coming in. I simply have, have to ask them how this has impact to their actual relationships. If they can speak about how it impacts the relationships, then more likely than not, they're probably gonna have a pretty good fit for the group. Then I'm gonna move to an-- aspect that kinda figure out what, what her behavior is like in groups in the past. Is she an active member? Is she a quiet member? I'm trying to figure out, is she gonna struggle? While I'm doing this, I'm making it assess of whether or not you think she's not gonna be, be a good fit for the group. At some point you'll see that I, I'm pretty confident that she's gonna fit in this group. She's touching all the right buttons in terms of kinda what an ideal member would be. This time, we're gonna move to a next part which I'm again to give some information about what to expect in the group. The main thing here is looking at group rules so she know par-- about what the expectations are, and these are things like I want you to come six times. You have to come on time. You have to be there the whole time. Uhm, you have to know that she's understand what, what, what is said in group stays in group. She has understand that she can of outside, outside connections with people in the group without bringing it back in. Uhm, as we talk with those things, what I'm trying to figure out, is can she do all of these things? If she cannot meet those tasks, she cannot be in this group. Uhm, but if she can, can meet those tasks, then we're moving toward this idea of, of recognizing whether or not she's gonna be in that group. You'll see at the end of the group of the, of the screening that I tell her that I wanna talk to my co-leader first before I say, yes, you're in the group. There are lot of times in which member wants to join the group right away. And in this example, I think she's a pretty good fit. But I'm also pretty aware that my co-leader is not here. So, I wanna have a brief conversation with him, uhm, and let him know my impressions. And more likely than not, we're gonna call her right away and say you're in. Uhm, but I don't wanna speak for him before I've had a chance to do so. 

01:34:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, so today we have about 15 minutes or so they kinda talk about group and kinda why you wanna be in group Cynthia(ph). So maybe we could start by kind of answering that question, like what brings you the group? And kinda what would you work in the group? 

01:34:15
CYNTHIA Okay. Uhm, I'm just having, uhm, issues with kind of cultural stuff, uhm, it's weighed cuz my mom raise me to be very, very independent but at the same time my Mexican culture is very about, uhm, you know, kinda traditional roles. Where the mother is very sacrificing and women are supposed to be this, you know, traditional way. And I'm kind of not that way cuz she raised me to be so independent but I'm having issues with kind of learning how to combine those together and make it more comfortable for me. 

01:34:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So when you say issues, what is, what is-- what does, what does that mean if you are on issues? 

01:35:00
CYNTHIA Uhm, like I'm having a lot of issues with my boyfriend - 

01:35:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:00
CYNTHIA - cuz he's also, ah, traditional - 

01:35:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:05
CYNTHIA - you know, Mexican male. 

01:35:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:05
CYNTHIA And it's kind of like I'm going to school and he kinda has a hard time understanding that like no one-- what I can take of you and it-- I'm having a hard time saying no, I need to take care of myself, so. 

01:35:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so it sounds like with him there's this independence kind of thing comes up where that gets challenged at times. 

01:35:25
CYNTHIA Yes. 

01:35:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And what-- does that impact other relationship that you have as well with your family or friends, other people you interact with... 

01:35:30
CYNTHIA Mainly my family. 

01:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:35
CYNTHIA They just kinda don't really understand why I wanna continue to go to school. 

01:35:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:35:40
CYNTHIA Uhm, that tomorrow like you should get married now and have kids. 

01:35:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:35:45
CYNTHIA I don't-- I'm not ready for that yet. 

01:35:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:35:45
CYNTHIA I just wanna finish school and have a career going and be able to provide for my family. 

01:35:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:50
CYNTHIA Whether my boyfriend ends up staying in my life or not. 

01:35:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:35:55
CYNTHIA I'm not saying that he's not going to but - 

01:35:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:35:55
CYNTHIA - just in case. 

01:36:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like you feel a lot of these pressures from people around you in terms of how they would like you to be, it sounds like. 

01:36:05
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:36:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And it sounds like that's the conflict you experience. What do you experience right at then, do you find yourself withdrawing? Do you find yourself got me like pulling away or like what you say issues like... 

01:36:15
CYNTHIA I get angry. 

01:36:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You got angry, okay. 

01:36:20
CYNTHIA And I get frustrated. 

01:36:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:36:20
CYNTHIA A lot. 

01:36:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:36:20
CYNTHIA Uhm, uhm, because of this conflict between my family members and my boyfriend. 

01:36:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:36:25
CYNTHIA Cuz I got angry and I get defensive. 

01:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so you find yourself in the middle of these conflicts or sounds like. 

01:36:30
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

01:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, when you say that I, I ask the question about kind of your relationships cuz that's usually what groups are about - 

01:36:40
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:36:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON - is that one thing is to happen in the group like, like we're gonna have is that, it doesn't really at, ah, group that has topic. 

01:36:45
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:36:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like to some groups might have a topic around transitions or an anger management let's say because this is what we call kind an open or interpersonal therapy group, or general therapy group. 

01:36:55
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:36:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And, and with that, with that-- what that really means is that everyone's is, is kinda come in together with a variety of concerns. But the one thing that kinda pulls everyone together is somehow their relationships are impacted. 

01:37:05
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

01:37:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, does that make sense? 

01:37:05
CYNTHIA Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. 

01:37:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

01:37:10
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

01:37:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I think what you're talking about that, that's probably a pretty good, good fit for the group, group that, that we were gonna do. 

01:37:15
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:37:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Have you been in, in a group before? 

01:37:15
CYNTHIA Yeah, I've been in a group once before. 

01:37:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:37:20
CYNTHIA And I had a really good experience with it. 

01:37:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. What do you remember in, in terms of the-- what made it good and what do you enjoy about it and... 

01:37:25
CYNTHIA Uhm, I think for me I just learned a lot about myself, things that I never knew before. 

01:37:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:37:30
CYNTHIA And, uhm, I just kinda knew-- I was able to be emotional in that group or otherwise I'm not able to be. 

01:37:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:37:35
CYNTHIA So those really good things that I really remember from my groups. 

01:37:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. What, what kind of-- when you think about a group may be like that you're in, may be other groups in your life. What kind of roles do you usually play like is there a certain-- or you're an outspoken person or someone who withdraws, or you... 

01:37:50
CYNTHIA I think I'm outspoken. 

01:37:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:37:55
CYNTHIA I think I speak my mind and I think if something bothers me I, I'll tell you right away if it bothers me. 

01:38:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:38:00
CYNTHIA Uhm, and also I, I'm able to be emotional in the groups - 

01:38:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:38:05
CYNTHIA - more than outside of like my friendships and families. 

01:38:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

01:38:10
CYNTHIA But I think in this kind of groups I'm able to be emo-- emotional and that's important for me. 

01:38:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so it sounds it gets important for you not just to be able to speak up but also to kind of be congruent - 

01:38:20
CYNTHIA Yes. 

01:38:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON - with kinda how you feel. 

01:38:20
CYNTHIA Yes. 

01:38:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So let me, let me take a moment to talk about a kind of group that we have so you get a sense of kind of what we're, we're hoping to do. 

01:38:30
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:38:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then we can kinda see if, if this is a good fit. 

01:38:30
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:38:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, so the, the group that we have is gonna meet on Tuesdays at 4. 

01:38:35
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:38:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah, we'll probably have between, uhm, wishing for eight people but I have anywhere from six, seven or eight, or eight people. This is gonna be a mix group. 

01:38:45
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:38:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So many women in the group. Uhm, like I said it's a general group so it's not, not one of which we have-- ask to come in with, with the same kind of concern but the one concern again is that, that somehow people, people's relationships are - 

01:38:55
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:38:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON - are being impacted. 

01:38:55
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:38:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, there some expectations we have with, with the group and one is that, is that you show up on time. 

01:39:00
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:39:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's important that you be able to kinda make it at Tuesday at four o'clock, uhm, group to group from 4 to 5:30. 

01:39:10
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:39:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, we'll start on time, we'll end on time. Of course if you're sick then you shouldn't come but besides that we, we'd ask you to come. And we also ask for an initial commitment of six times. 

01:39:20
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:39:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And the reason we ask that is that sometimes when you're in a group, uhm, the first couple of times can be, uhm, I wanna say rocky but sometimes you don't know it's gonna happen in the first couple of times. There's a lot of different kind of personalities coming together. 

01:39:30
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:39:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And sometimes there can be some anxiety or kind of fear about what this is gonna look like. 

01:39:35
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:39:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, but often it takes kinda five, six-- five or six times you can feel like, oh, this is what it's like. And so, we want group members to have a good, good sense of what an actual group is gonna feel. 

01:39:50
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:39:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So we ask for, for the initial commitment. We also ask the people, uhm, like I said they're on there on time, that they make this, make this a priority. 

01:39:55
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:39:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, so that if you're going to come then, then you're gonna come, it's not every other week but you come. We also ask about people kinda maintain confidentiality in group. And, and what I mean by that is that as a group leader, I will be myself and actually, uhm, my co-leader Jeffrey who's not here right now. 

01:40:10
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:40:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, but we can promise you of course that we're gonna maintain confidentiality in the group. And we can't promise that all the members are going to do that but the expectation is that everyone, everyone kinda maintain what's in the room and that, and that stays there. And what I mean by that, it doesn't mean you can't talk about anything that ever comes up because that actually probably isn't that useful? 

01:40:30
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:40:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Because we know that in group there are things that are gonna, but a lot of the work for you is gonna come, taking that outside of the group. But we ask is that we're gonna take that outside of the group, you don't take people's identities, identifying information. 

01:40:45
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:40:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, and share it with other people. Uhm, you can certainly share your own experiences, and you can talk about kinda what's important to you. And why it's important but we ask that you would identify-- by other people. 

01:40:55
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:40:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Does that make sense? 

01:40:55
CYNTHIA Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. 

01:40:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, okay. And by that I what I mean again, so let's say you have a group and, uhm, and this your mother's comes up and you come with your boyfriend and, and you can say, oh, my, gosh, this sho-- as your mother's come up tonight I should start thinking about, about my mom. 

01:41:10
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:41:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That would be great. 

01:41:10
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:41:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But it wouldn't be, uhm, you know, there's someone in the group and, and her name is Katie(ph) and she talked about her mom. And all of a sudden now, all of a sudden (inaudible ) Katie(ph) and her mom and make them peace. 

01:41:20
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:41:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Other peace that we ask to is that, is that people maintain their relationships within the group. Uhm, and, and if there's any outside contact in the group that people would bring that back in. 

01:41:30
CYNTHIA Uh-hmm. 

01:41:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What I mean by that is that, you know, the group becomes pretty intimate, pretty quick. Uhm, you find people that you can connect with, and may be you connect with people in a new way that you've never think before. Uhm, but after group, when group is over, our expectations is that-- as that group is over. 

01:41:45
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:41:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But it-- you may be that you, you have a conversation after group, may be they walk in to your car, may they randomly ran somebody at coffee shop or at the supermarket. And if you have this kind of contacts, we just ask that you bring those back into the room and you make sure that everyone is aware of that. 

01:42:00
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:42:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, any question about any of those kind of, kind of expectations? 

01:42:05
CYNTHIA Ah, so right now no. 

01:42:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:42:05
CYNTHIA But can I ask later if I do have a question? 

01:42:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure absolutely, yeah. 

01:42:10
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:42:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, again we're asking everyone whose coming into the group we're asking that everyone can meet those expectations first. 

01:42:15
CYNTHIA Okay, yeah. 

01:42:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, that sounds like you can get here at four o'clock. 

01:42:15
CYNTHIA Yes. 

01:42:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And that's not a problem and so. 

01:42:15
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:42:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, other thing is just to help you become aware in terms of kind of, again, what kind of group that, that we're going to run. Uhm, we're not gonna come in with the team each week. 

01:42:25
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:42:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, that we're not gonna plan the group really we're gonna have each person think about what's important to them. So often, we start the group that's gonna call, call a check in which you have a chance to go around and kinda talk about what's important for you right now. Uhm, and then everyone, everyone gets a chance to go, there are may be some groups in which you get a chance to talk a lot about what, what's going on if you're in some groups, you may not. Uhm, so, what it be like for you, you know, to talk about yourself like that, each week they come in they kinda share, this is who I am, this is what I'm going through. 

01:43:00
CYNTHIA Uhm, right now, I feel like a little nervous about it. 

01:43:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:43:00
CYNTHIA Uhm, but I think like you said before other people are talking about things - 

01:43:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-hmm. 

01:43:10
CYNTHIA - and I can really, I think I would be willing to jump in and - 

01:43:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:10
CYNTHIA - talk about myself too. 

01:43:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And that sounds like that's been your history in the past that as the group gets going, you seem to have, have no problem with. 

01:43:20
CYNTHIA Yes. 

01:43:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:20
CYNTHIA Yeah. 

01:43:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And I think it's-- honestly I think it's pretty normal to feel, feel some anxiety or some kind of uncertainty about the group. I mean, you don't know who's gonna be there and probably everyone's probably feeling the exact same way. 

01:43:30
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:43:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So as leaders, we'll do our job that help people feel comfortable. Uhm, and like, the early parts of group, it's really gonna-- about getting to know who's in the room. 

01:43:40
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:43:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, so again, at the first night, we have you come in, we have you introduce yourself, talk about what, what feels important to you, why you're here. 

01:43:50
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:43:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, and then we, we permit good-- girl friend there. 

01:43:50
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:43:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then, any questions anyhow about, kind of what... 

01:43:55
CYNTHIA Uhm, ah, so right now, no - 

01:43:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:55
CYNTHIA - nothing that I can think of. 

01:44:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What-- I mean, one thing I would say is that you know, a group is a collection of, of a variety of people and you're one of the first people that, that we talk to so far. 

01:44:05
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:44:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uhm, in terms of creating this, this new group. And I'm gonna take some time to talk with my co-leader about kind of you, and other people. And what we're trying to really figure out is get a good fit. Uhm, so what I'll do is take your information and give you call back this week and let you know, kinda where, where things stand and when our starting date would be. 

01:44:25
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:44:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sounds that's good? 

01:44:25
CYNTHIA Yeah, sounds good. 

01:44:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. Okay. 

01:44:25
CYNTHIA Okay. 

01:44:25
What do you like about Group Leadership? Lindsay Burtt 

01:44:30
LINDSAY BURTT Okay, yeah, I'm just now starting learn group leadership. And I think what I really like about it is actually co-leading with people. Uhm, cuz I think that you always have someone behind you in teaching myself. As a newbie, you're like worried that you're gonna miss something. So I think the whole experience makes it less frightening with the co-leader. Uhm, I also like how your kind of like constantly present within the group, uhm, and that's something that I'm not very used to but this direct exposure is very enlightening. Uhm, yeah, so, I kinda like to hear now of it. Although I really like it, it's also the hardest part of it because you have to be keeping track of people. And I kind of have like a very spacy mind sometimes but then again, that's why it's good for the co-leader to be there. 

01:45:20
Andrea Gustin 

01:45:25
ANDREA GUSTIN I just look forward to learn like using all the skills that I've learned like cuing for example. I didn't know what that was a year ago when I was leading a group. And it's such a basic skill. And I'm just really excited to use it with like real people and feel like an actual leader instead of just some girl leading a group. I actually do wanna do groups in my profession. Uhm, I really like the dynamic between different people. And, uhm, I think it's really interesting to like have a co-leader and develop that relationship with someone on like a professional level. And I don't know, I, I witnessed a lot of groups and I've been a participant in a lot of groups in my life. And I really see that they do work and they do help. And, yeah, uhm, I do wanna be a leader. I love it when it finally gets to a point when everyone is honest and everyone is vulnerable, and everybody says what's on their mind. That's my favorite part. I don't like the beginning stages where people are just being nice and they're afraid to be really honest. I, I like it when it gets like deep into it. 

01:46:45
What is your advice for future Group Leaders? 

01:46:45
LINDSAY BURTT Uhm, my advice would probably just to be open to the experience because even though I do-- identify with existentialism, uhm, I still really, really like this class. Uhm, I would say that it's probably one of the top classes that I would enjoy. Uhm, you know, that first I was like, how is this gonna relate to me and probably not gonna wanna do group work that once I was keeping my mind open enough to actually endure and like be a part of the experience. It's been like mind-boggling. Uhm, so much though that I would may be even wanna get further training and do group therapy on my own after-- in, in the field. 

01:47:20
What is your favorite or most surprising thing about Group Leadership? 

01:47:25
LINDSAY BURTT I think the most mind-boggling thing is the fact you go into a room with a bunch of stranger s then you come out feeling closer than you with some of your friends in your life. Uhm, it's such an open space and you feel safe and it's just-- I don't know. It's the weirdest experience because I, I've said some things that I haven't even told my deepest partner or deepest friends, so. 

01:47:45
What is the most challenging Group Leadership? 

01:47:50
ANDREA GUSTIN Uhm, I'm gonna be the leader today actually. And, I think it will be hard to like participate while maintaining like, ah, professional stance. And it, it's hard to be like vulnerable in front of all of these people. And then like still be in charge. And that's what I'm having trouble with like balancing the two roles. Yeah, there's definitely an aspect of being afraid to talk in front of people in general that I have like very scared of presentations and just talking in front of a large group of people. So, having to do that in front of all these people and be a leader and be in charge, ah, I'm still really anxious about that. So, I think I just need more experience so on. 

01:48:40
Words of wisdom from experienced Group Leaders? James Ruby, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Human Services California State University, Fullerton 

01:48:40
JAMES RUBY We use the phrase, the power of group a lot. And I think, uhm, anybody who's been a part of, ah, a really impactful or affective group knows what that means. Ah, it's, it's kind of a construct, it's like we know when we see it but it can't borrow it from somebody else but I know it when I see it. And good groups are just inherently powerful when, when folks really invest, so. 

01:49:05
What do you like best about leading groups? Olga Mejia, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Counseling California State University, Fullerton 

01:49:05
OLGA MEJIA The first thing is, uhm, out of all the different ways of doing therapy, that's my favorite. Uhm, just something about group I think and the first thing that stands out to me is just the potential for healing, ah, for people, from interpersonal difficulties. I think, uhm, in the ways that I've seen people impacted, uhm, kinda seeing people worked through conflict and become closer and kind of heal. And, and that closeness. Uhm, to me it's just amazing to, to witness and amazing to be a part of, uhm, you know, and to help clients to be able to do that. Uhm, I think that other thing that's related to that is, uhm, you know, that in therapy if it's individual, the conversation really you know, it's the client and the therapist, the client and the therapist and then group. And the group members are learning from each other actually. So they're not just learning from me or if I have, ah, co-leader, uhm, a co-therapist. But there-- I'm actually learning from each other that, that's just as important. Uhm, you know, it's anything else or I might say, ah, in the group. 

01:50:20
JAMES RUBY My favorite thing about leading groups always is the diversity of people in the room. Uhm, the diversity of stories, uhm, the wide variety, the experiences that people bring. And watching how those, uhm, really varied perspectives linked together. To see how people who might not otherwise have had any sort relationship, find a commonality with one another. And it just happens there in front of you. So, that's, that's always my favorite because I feel like they are corporate genius that happens when all the group members are really, ah, cooperating and participating something far beyond anything I could ever do individually with someone, someone. 

01:51:00
Matt Englar-Carlson, Ph.D. California State University, Fullerton 

01:51:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In terms of, in terms of my favorite thing about leading groups there are so many things that I'm aware of. I think the main thing is that I just like the excitement. I think, when I think about being a counselor and being clinical practice. Ah, I know that I'm someone who needs excitement and needs things to be varied. I mean, I love about groups is that they completely unpredictable. I've no idea what's gonna happen. And I think that some people in the field might find that really scary cuz you wanna know exactly what's gonna happen. I like the fact that there's no script. And without to bring a script which means there's untold possibilities. And I think that's what I like about group is that it's exciting and that is important for me when I think about seeing clients on like single basis. You know, I know as a professional, I need my data to be broken up to. And so groups give me that again that spark, that interest, that is just kind of exciting. And, ah, all of it just fun like I think groups are fun. There's an interpersonal component about groups in which people are learning new things for first time. And there are experiences in vivo like again that's something that's really exciting is that in (inaudible ) sometimes are talking about things that happened before, type of the things in the past which are going to do. And in group, it's all right in front of you. It's happening right before your eyes. So, you don't have to say, you know, when this happens or work that's how I feel because work experience and you're right there in the room. And for me that's part is exciting as it can be as a counselor. 

01:52:30
Is there anything about Group Leadership that you wish you had learned in school? 

01:52:30
JAMES RUBY One thing is that I don't know, let me check on that is an acceptable answer because I think we kinda get the solution that we're supposed to know whatever it is which is really preposterous. And actually quite irri-- when you think about it that somehow no matter what somebody shares or what somebody is dealing that I should have some sort of-- sorry, I just hit your microphone. Ah, ah, so that would bear some air gun. So but that this, we get this weird idea that we should somehow have, uhm, ah, insight into whatever everybody is experiencing, or if somebody has a question, if somebody is struggling or something, I should have some sort of unique, uhm, either experience related to it or insight related to it that should help them feel better. But that notion of again kinda letting go, ah, but saying, "I don't know, let me check on that," or, "I'll have to look into that." Uhm, that, that's okay. Ah, that's one piece cuz I think graduate school, we spend a lot of time learning material. Uhm, because we're learning material for test and we're learning materials for licensure exams, and all those sorts of things. And so, there's this sense that, uhm, we should know but I don't know, I found that more often than not, when I take a, a posture of not knowing, kind of you know, flatten hierarchy, step down say, ah, really what I like to call an intellectual humility, uhm, I'm much more effective. And I think much more helpful because I'm not fostering dependents from the client on me or anything like that. 

01:54:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON When I think about what I didn't learn in graduate school, I think I learned a lot honestly. I have some quite-- I, I feel really fortunate I've gone to program, a training program that valued group. And I think I learn the difference between people who viewed group as a first option versus group as, as a second option. And I learn early on that groups worked. And I saw them working in, in school settings where I was working. I saw them working at, at, at University Counseling Centers that I was working at. I was around staffs that also believe that groups that were the first option when appropriate. And so throughout my training, I guess I've always had this idea that groups always we-- in many ways ought to preferred option. Uhm, and I was hopeful, I think what I again I had to learn as I, I think I had to learn patience. I didn't learn the value of patience like, uhm, I think I remember graduate school, people teaching about silence, and sitting with silence but I didn't learn patience. Like, I can say what silence but I'm not always patient. I think there, there's bit of a di-- bit of a difference. And I think I'm someone who likes to fill space but I've also learn that people are really going to overcome, you have to give them actual time to do it and work it there, their own kind of pace and that's been-- (inaudible ) for me. 

01:55:25
OLGA MEJIA Things that I wish I had learned in school. I think in my training, we definitely talked about the importance of, uhm, doing our own work. Uhm, I think in school I wish that they have been emphasized more. Think the more I've been doing this worked the more I realized that the, the more clear I am about me, the clear I am about trusting myself, about trusting my instincts the better, uhm, group leader that I am. And so I wish they had been emphasized more, uhm, even though I certainly have engaged with the process of doing my own work, the more conscious, you know, the times that I've taken the more effort to really consciously work on that. I've noticed the difference, and, uhm, both and, and the group the I do, ah, the work that I do with groups. 

01:56:10
What is your favorite type of Group? 

01:56:10
OLGA MEJIA I think a lot of what brings people to therapy is interpersonal difficulties You know, and so I think group is a way to work on it right there, right in the moment. It's not something that you know, let's give you some homework and you go work on it. Which is fine, you know, take your homework. Uhm, but it's something we can actually work on right here, right now and not just with me but with other, like other group members. Yes, I am enjoy the most, uhm, processed groups. So, uhm, I think that's a lot of my strength as a therapist come from being able to track dynamics, being able to track process, to talk to process, and, uhm, been encouraged group members to start to notice process for themselves, and, uhm, start using it. Uhm, so yeah, I think that, that's my-- what I gravitate towards the most. 

01:57:05
JAMES RUBY One of my favorite groups that I've ever led was a grief recovery group and it was specifically aimed that individuals should lost either a partner, a family member, a love one, a good friend to AIDS. And, uhm, it was in a, ah, clinical setting in, in, uhm, in Chicago. And it was time limited but it was so powerful. Uhm, the opportunity that people have to support one another and to, uhm, listen to each other's stories and to really kind of honor the family member, that love one that they lost for me really made that experience a, uhm, I don't know, made that space like a sacred space if you will. It-- we-- it was just a room, but it became something very much more powerful, uhm, when folks started really opening up. You know, it's one of-- it's like the icing on a cake. I know that group is powerful in and of itself but part of what I love it is it's powerful for me. Ah, so may be I may, uhm, I don't know, ah, a participa-- participating voyeur in some ways. You know, because I'm fed by that experience. I really am. I learn, I grow, I'm stretched. I am, so, I, I, I love that. 

01:58:25
What are your favorite interventions to use in Groups 

01:58:25
JAMES RUBY One of the things I like to use is kind of from the realm of psychodrama, it's, ah, improvisational acting exercises. And, uhm, we use, uhm, what I'm leading at-- leading groups, you know, or working with the, you know, co-leader. We will oftentimes use those kind of what the twofold purpose in mind. On one level, its-- it can be-- they can be really nice icebreakers. People have an opportunity to, ah, explore something, do something very different. Uhm, but they're also nice tools for assessment. And then by assessment here, I'm not talking about clinical diagnosis of course but kinda get a sense of how people feel comfortable getting out of their comfort zone. Are they resistant to certain things or are they not? So what kind of supporter, encouragement might they need to participate more fully in the group and I love those. 

01:59:20
OLGA MEJIA And I think that first thing that came to mind is actually the unplanned intervention. You know, so I might have like a tool kit you know, of different interventions that I might try. Uhm, but in my experience the ones that had been the most useful and the most impactful and powerful, uhm, have been once that I have them planned. Ah, and I am paying attention to the process of the group and the group members and that, uhm, I'm being responsive to that. And so, in the moment, I might think, o-- empty chair are really work right now, or you know, connecting this client to this client. Uhm, so I would say probably the unplanned intervention is my favorite one. 

02:00:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In terms of favorite interventions, you know, there's a lot of, of new things that I've been learning. I think that's the nice thing about group, I'm learning more right now. I've led groups for many, many years, school settings, professional settings, community settings. Uhm, weekend workshops and I'm still learning. And I think my favorite intervention some ways is to learn from people around me, but, ah, I definitely like things that are very experiential. What I've been learning in terms of my (inaudible ) is learning more about how to do kinda psychodrama, how to do more playing things in the room. And how to really use the members of the group as the support. It's quite a lot men's groups that's my area of expertise and my, my passion. And it's one thing to talk about stuff but I like using the power of, of, of the guys in the room. And so if we're talking about for example about how hard it is to break a pair-- failure or how hard it is to work through something. I like getting the guys up and making the guys make a wall and have the guy push through the barrier, you know, where someone's talking about needing some support. I like getting the guys to come around and give them support like hold on to them really, really push them on the back so that he feel supported. And, so I like the idea again of bringing these things on in the moment. And you know, it's playful and it's fun but again, a group of which people actually doing things I think is much more exciting. Uhm, and I think you know, group gives you permissions to the things you usually wouldn't do, like you would never do the stuff in real life, like you cannot go to your corporate retreat and do this. You can go to work and try this gives you a very a contrive and, and, and very kind of fake. But in a group setting, when everyone has trust, then you can do things like this. And, and it, and it's meaningful. 

02:01:40
How did you advance from being a beginning group leader to a more experienced group leader? 

02:01:40
JAMES RUBY I think what something to move forward in that, one I guess is just practice obviously just working and doing the work. Uhm, believe it or not I think an-- another key element for me is letting go of control. Ah, I think early on I was so concern with wanting to do it light. And wanting to make sure that everybody in the group participate in. We try to participate equally and we try to do all those sorts of things that I really felt like I was trying to like the, the guy in the old shows who used to spin the plates on the different needles. It's like I was trying to spin all these plates and keep it going. And I was taking my responsibility for everybody else's participation. When I begin to let go, and begin to honestly just kinda trust the process, ah, that the group experience would kind of draw people in when they were ready to come in. Uhm, I became much better. So, ah, in that regard truly less more in terms of my, uhm, my work as a group leader, so.

OLGA MEJIA I think for me, uhm, that I can think of in my development, what's been the most important and to be able to do on planned interventions as to trust myself and to trust the instinct that I have. You know, as I'm listening to clients or, uhm, as the process is happening. I think in the past I would notice it and I would say maybe it's just me or, uhm, or I was too scared to say something about it. So I would say, the more experience I've gained, uhm, and doing in unplanned intervention comes from, uhm, just trusting myself. I'm thinking of something, I'm feeling something and then I give it a name.

What do you find most challenging when leading groups? 

02:03:30
OLGA MEJIA Challenges, uhm, well, I've run groups, uhm, for clients and for trainees so kind of, ah, clinical, uhm, and then training groups. Uhm, in, in some ways for me, ah, as, ah, psychologist and as, ah, uhm, as a professor, running training groups have been more challenging. But, uhm, I would say actually then I guess, I cross both is a client whose resistant to, ah, engage with the therapeutic process. You know, or particularly in the process of looking at themselves. Uhm, I find that challenging. Uhm, I think works that I-- ah, ways that I work on it. Uhm, I think the, the first thing is to have consultation, you know, to have consultation. Uhm, and kind of talk through colleagues of around, this is what's happening, this is what I'm thinking. Uhm, I think related to that is very much, uhm, looking at my stuff, you know, kind of what part of me is getting engaged with this client. And, uhm, what part of it is that mine, and what part of it is that theirs. Uhm, so I think that's another way that I try to work on that challenge and, uhm, also I, uhm, a lot of reading, kind of reading, research, uhm, stuff like that.

MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In terms of, of challenges and how to, to overcome them, I think for me you know, one of the hard things for me was actually learn how to speak up. I remember the first group that I ever did was a graduate student and I didn't say a thing for 3 weeks. I do not say a thing and at some point other group members kinda wonder if I could speak. And I think I was very intimidated by the group and the leader I was with. And it took me a lot of time to learn how to, how to have an active voice. And, so the challenge for me was learning how to be in the room and I think I started doing elementary school groups and somehow being in the room with 5, 6, and 7-year-olds were not that intimidating. And then I worked at the junior high and then I worked at the college kids and, and older adults, and now, you can't shut me up. Uhm, but I tell like my students they have a hard time believing that's actually true. But for me having voice and I-- and some-- that, that was a pretty big challenge for me. You know, and coming and overcoming that challenge what I realize I did is I found really good mentors who could teach me. And I think that's you know, about how to grow and get better. You have to find people who you trust and people who, who can teach you and then you have to be teachable. And I think that's something I've learn too is that you know, in, in graduate school they tell you, you know, you're gonna get feedback. What people don't know is tell you how to take feedback and I actually pull back on my, my kind of experience as an athlete and try to be coachable realizing that the coaches are there for a reason. And if I was gonna fight everything that the coach told me, I probably wasn't gonna learn anything. So, I can take feedback and take it on and with the experienced leader whose willing to give me real feedback, I found that I got a lot better.
