DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Happy to be with you here again today. Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is In this moment, I am safe. For even(ph) evolutionary perspective perceiving and even rehearsing the triggers enthused dangerous situations kept us on alert and aware of signs of danger, so we could react quickly and move ourselves from harm's way, makes perfect sense. Yet the same mechanism that's part of our human survival system can leave us feeling completely overwhelmed and depleted every minute of the day. Sending a corrective message and interrupting the habit of sitting on the edge of our seats and perceiving danger everywhere allows us to let the body restore and replenish. As we know, in life dangerous things do occur and yet truly dangerous events tend to be rare. They are not part of our norm. They don't hurt every minute of the day. Feeling like danger is occurring right now and in every moment leaves us less able to deal with those moments in life we would really do need to respond quickly because we are already depleted even before true problems arrive. So, let's make it a practice to be aware of safety and send the correct message right now. So, we are calm and centered as a habit. Let's practice together. First, notice this moment. Really, ask yourself is there anything dangerous occurring right now in this precise moment? Two, if your answer is yes, do what you need to do to remove yourself from harm's way. Right now, move yourself from any actual, physical danger and restart this program after you once again in a safe place. Three, if there is no danger, then slowly say the following words, along with me and allow yourself to really let them sink in and be a part of you. Four, "In this moment I am safe." Five, "There's nothing going on in this moment." Six, "I am here and I am okay. I am safe." Seven, notice how this makes you feel and then once again repeat. "In this moment, I am safe. There's nothing going on in this moment. I am here and I am okay. I am safe."
