ERNEST ROSSI  Welcome you all to this demonstration. I would like to say first that I always follow the four stage creative process in my demonstrations because that's where I've done a lot of research with. All of us, every hour and a half, we climb a mountain, I’ll call it Darwin's Daily & Hourly Dharma.

ERNEST ROSSI Every hour and a half, we begin a basic rest activity cycle where we're curious about something and then stage II, we start to get engaged with something whether it's a mother baking a cake or a father at his work or a sportsman playing a game. And now it gets a little tough, because you’re changing from what you were doing before to something new. This is often a little bit negative, little bit conflictual. So this is the stage most people are in when they decide to come to psychotherapy. On the positive side, this is when you're incubating, you're replaying and you go through a period of private inner creative replay, and that's where the real inner work of gene expression and brain plasticity takes place. Notice there's a stage of arousal, it's like climbing a little mountain. With luck, yes, you do hit stage III, which is breakout and insight, and this is usua -- always a positive experience. And then the (inaudible )is to go right into stage IV where you reintegrate yourself and say, okay, this is how where I can change my behavior, this is how I can finish my task and so forth. And this is a 24-hour cycle the same thing. At night, when we sleep, we dream every hour and a half or two, and it's in our dreams that we have dialogs between our hippocampus and our cortex about anything's that new that happened that day, and has set new stuff that turns on gene expression and brain plasticity. So for a volunteer, I would like someone naturally whose in senses they're in stage II. Stage II is when you or most people are when they come to therapy, they feel stuck in something. Typically, they're going through a life transition. Typically, they feel a little bit conflict, an uncertainty about themselves. Typically, hey, they might have negative thoughts about their abilities and so forth to cope; and most typically, they have dreams that are very vivid, big dreams, strange dreams, unnatural dreams and all those unusual qualities are what turns on gene expression. So is there anyone in the audience, who has an issue that they would like to... Okay, would you like to come up? 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:25
KATHRYN And so, our volunteer is signing the release form. 

00:04:30
ERNEST ROSSI And so, what I'm gonna be doing in this demonstration is using this four stage creative process in what I call the Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience. A recent paper we published in American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis shows that this experience simulates stem cell healing, attempts to tamp down oxidation in our cells and that tends to damp down (inaudible ) Hi, your named Mary. 

00:05:10
MARY MARONI Mary Maroni. 

00:05:10
ERNEST ROSSI Mary Maroni. 

00:05:10
KATHRYN  I'm not actually familiar with this particular microphone, so I don't where it, how exactly it fits and if I don't have it correctly somebody will come up, I'm sure. That feel comfortable? 

00:05:25
MARY MARONI Huh.. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? 

00:05:30
KATHRYN I need help, please. 

00:05:30
MARY MARONI I don't think it's on my ears. 

00:05:30
KATHRYN I don't know how this microphone works 

00:05:35
MARY MARONI That's okay. That's okay. That's okay. Here we go. Hello. 

00:05:35
KATHRYN We'll get you situated, because then you can be very comfortable. 

00:05:40
MARY MARONI Thank you. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:05:50
ERNEST ROSSI Hi. So all this fuss, just all about you? 

00:05:50
MARY MARONI  And I think that's lovely. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:05
MARY MARONI Hello. No? Yes? 

00:06:05
KATHRYN  You can leave it like that, they'll adjust the sound. 

00:06:10
MARY MARONI Okay. 

00:06:15
KATHRYN And you're back in the room. 

00:06:15
MARY MARONI Okay. 

00:06:15
ERNEST ROSSI Right. One way you can help me, Mary, is you snooze, I'm wearing humongous hearing aids and one of 'em broke down the other day. So I'm sitting next to you and so raise your voice level a little for me today, okay? 

00:06:30
MARY MARONI Yes. 

00:06:30
ERNEST ROSSI  And occasionally I might turn to my wife because she'll help me with some sounds or words that I can't quite pick up. So tell us your story, why are you here? 

00:06:45
MARY MARONI Well, I think over the last few years huh..that I've hmm.. taken on a lot and invited some stress, but more than that invited a gene to express inflammation. 

00:07:05
ERNEST ROSSI Really? 

00:07:05
MARY MARONI And I would like that gene to stop expressing itself. 

00:07:10
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic. I think you've come to the right place. 

00:07:15
MARY MARONI That's what I was hoping, I was hoping that. 

00:07:15
ERNEST ROSSI  Well, tell me a bit more about the inflammation. Has it been diagnosed medically, it's a inflammation condition. 

00:07:25
MARY MARONI Yes. 

00:07:25
ERNEST ROSSI Really? 

00:07:25
MARY MARONI Yes. 

00:07:25
ERNEST ROSSI Ah! You know that I work very privately, especially in front of an audience of this sort. So at anytime you share just what's appropriate for you to share. Some information that would be help for me and the audience would be for you on a simple scale of 1-10, where 10 is the worst inflammation you have ever experienced, five's efforts zero. 10? Wow. You're experiencing level 10 right now? 

00:08:00
MARY MARONI Well, I did in the past year, not right now. 

00:08:00
ERNEST ROSSI Oh! 

00:08:00
MARY MARONI You're asking now? 

00:08:00
ERNEST ROSSI  Yeah, at this moment? 

00:08:05
MARY MARONI Ah..oh.. Five. 

00:08:10
ERNEST ROSSI Five. 

00:08:10
MARY MARONI It's really hard for me to do the numbers. 

00:08:10
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:08:10
MARY MARONI I like to do little bit, medium or a lot. 

00:08:15
ERNEST ROSSI So it's a kind of average level of inflammation. 

00:08:20
MARY MARONI I think so. Ha huh.. 

00:08:20
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. I have my own style of working, but I have to share with you and the audience of what Milton H. Erickson would do, okay. He would look indulgently at you and he would smile sweetly and say, a five!. It's only a five! He would tend to make fun of the symptom, put the symptom down, not you. 

00:08:45
MARY MARONI I understand. 

00:08:45
ERNEST ROSSI But the symptom itself. So suppose we use one of his techniques. If it's merely five, well, is it even worth bothering with this miserable symptom, but okay, we're into situation. But I tell you what, Mary, I like to have you raise your hands about like so, and for those in the audience I call this the hand mirroring position. And tune into those hands, look at those hands Mary almost as if you've never seen them before. And as you look at those hands, I wonder, if you can say which hand is little bit warmer or cooler than the other? The audience should notice, I’m not asking her to make a hand warmer or cooler, I'm asking her does she notice, because in fact our hands are at different temperatures. Which hand? That one? 

00:09:55
MARY MARONI Warmer. 

00:09:55
ERNEST ROSSI Warmer on the right side. You see, I asked like all implicit processing heuristics, they're permissive open suggestions, they allow the client to create a response, allow the client to go inside. And if you notice, Mary took about a minute or so, that's exactly what you're looking for a client that takes it seriously and they really tune in. It took her about a minute or so to use the RNA, DNA. It takes about a minute for your nerves to pick up a suggestion like that, do some internal work, and then create the response, so already Mary is on a path to dealing with her issues. I go on usually. Which of those hands now Mary would be more flexible? Which hand more rigid than the other? 

00:10:55
MARY MARONI  I think this is the more flexible hand. 

00:11:05
ERNEST ROSSI Wow. 

00:11:05
MARY MARONI Being right-handed, I'm not certain... 

00:11:10
ERNEST ROSSI Very good. And now, notice audience, these are all unusual questions, the fact that they're novel tends to activate heightened neural activity and gene expression. Okay, let's take a little jump now, Mary. This time I'd like to have you tell me, which of those hands would be more like your mother, which would be like more your father? 

00:11:35
MARY MARONI Okay. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:50
MARY MARONI I think this would be mother, and I think this would be father. 

00:11:50
ERNEST ROSSI Wonderful. And now I'll ask the question of interest really to all of us. Which of those hands that's more expresses about your inflammation, the condition that you're here for? So the audience knows this, I have to use a series of rather neutral questions to help a person get focused inside and then the crucial question, which I'm asking her to project into one hand or the other, the condition she's here to deal with on making the unconscious visible and absorbable behavior. Yes, I'm really asking her whole mind-body to focus and, of course, that makes no sense from a rational point of view, which hand expresses the inflammation. And yet, most people can make a distinction of this sort, and they're thereby engaging in the creative process, which would it be? The right or left? Wow. Now it's on the left-hand. So that's striking isn't it? The warmth, the flexibility, the right-side, her mother on the right, and now the symptom is on the left. So let’s continue with that, focusing on that left hand that expresses that symptom, Mary. And now I'm gonna ask you another question, if the left hand represents inflammation, in a way that you may actually be sensing it, what does the right-hand express just the opposite of the inflammation? 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
ERNEST ROSSI And you can maintain that privately within yourself or you can share a word or two, what you feel the opposite of the inflammation with that would feel like? 

00:14:10
MARY MARONI  Alright. So the question, was... the question was, what does the right-hand represents that would be opposite of the inflammation? 

00:14:25
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, exactly. 

00:14:25
MARY MARONI I'm having difficulty with that. 

00:14:30
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:14:30
MARY MARONI I keep thinking that the right-hand is what actually, you know, takes charge and makes decisions and might even invite the inflammation. 

00:14:40
ERNEST ROSSI Might invite and bring on... 

00:14:45
MARY MARONI Like this is the dominant hand and maybe I take on too much and maybe... 

00:14:50
ERNEST ROSSI I see. 

00:14:50
MARY MARONI that affects my health and... 

00:14:55
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:14:55
MARY MARONI So it's difficult for me to shift to opposite, but I could try harder... 

00:15:00
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. I tell you what, let it stay that way, that right you see a hard task that might actually be bringing on the inflammation. Let me ask another question, okay, so now we've got the cause of the symptom on the right-hand, over activity taking on too much and we've got the symptom in the left-hand. I would like to ask Mary another question. If there was a healing source within your body or mind in someplace that's the opposite of this symptom, where would that... where do you sense that feeling source would be? And to the audience I say, these are ideal dynamic questions, the idea gives rise to a dynamic, so Mary presented me with a paradox, so I jumped to another level what I call level of metacognition to look for a that's the opposite of her symptom, the opposite of her to strident, to take charge, what would be the opposite of that, that would be a healing factor within you? 

00:16:20
MARY MARONI Is it okay to have it in two places? 

00:16:25
ERNEST ROSSI Sure. You notice how agreeable I am. Two place are better than one for a healing source, fantastic Mary. Go for it. 

00:16:35
MARY MARONI Okay. The two places and what I experience is, it's in my mind and it's a peaceful calm feeling... 

00:16:45
ERNEST ROSSI Wonderful. 

00:16:45
MARY MARONI But... and very peaceful. And, but it is also, I'd say in my abdomen... 

00:16:55
ERNEST ROSSI Wonderful. 

00:16:55
MARY MARONI ... just very peaceful and calm. 

00:16:55
ERNEST ROSSI Wonderful. So calm in your mind and calm in your, what we could call the gustatory, that center solar plexus and I don't know if you know, Mary, that in our digestive system there are, in fact, millions of extra genes that are in the bacteria that help us digest, and in fact, we could not live without those bacteria. And that is a healing source within you, a body healing source, millions of your genes. We've only got 20, 25,000, but you've got all these millions of helpers. And not only that, those millions of helpers and your whole gustatory area are in synch with the peace in your mind. So I'd like to have you again, just focus on the hand, your mind and the millions of extra genes in your gut and let's see what begins to happen between those hand, between your body, and the hands of course, can move in a symbolic way they would like to, they might come together, they might move apart, they might be like Shakespearean actors on the stage. And we notice Mary taking a deeper breath. Yes, she's completed little unit of work and now she's embarked on another. Yes, wonderful, Mary. And so, the first phase of my work is over as a therapist. I think, we have a problem, I have her engaged in working on the problem. 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, another comfortable deep breath. Yes, that's right, Mary. Experiencing. Yes. The hands dropping comfortably to your lap and let's see where you’re whole mind-body feelings sense what kind of a... and is it really possible that... you notice all by sentence stems, I let her fill in. Again I call these implicit processing heuristics. They're permissive, but I don't know the answer, and she doesn't know the answer until something starts cooking in her. And I wonder, for example, is there a contrast she senses between the peace and her mind with the million helpers in her solar plexus? Is there a contrast between that peace and health and healing part of her? And the inflammation in one hand and her behavior of inciting the inflammation with too much excessive activity. And when the audience sees me do this, I'm saying to myself "Okay, shut up, you damn fool! She's working fine by herself. Shut up and let her work." 

00:21:15
[sil.] 

00:21:30
ERNEST ROSSI If some of you are very acute in your eyesight would see that there's a slowing of the flutter of her eyes. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:22:05
ERNEST ROSSI That's right, enjoying that wonderful mental and body helpers on the one hand. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:23:05
ERNEST ROSSI I'm making a gesture to the audience indicating that her eyes have closed now. And this is wonderful, gentle progression that we're seeing in Mary and expresses her equanimity, her focus and when you're fortunate enough to have such a client, well, this is pure gold. This is a client who's apparently really working inside and what is the work? Work is the problem area and I've also consulated the opposite of that problem, the healing function that she pushes it into her brain and gut and on those two sides of her... to interaction. How's this interaction going to play out? I don't know. 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
ERNEST ROSSI But I do know that Mary's equanimity and the peace and healing that she's found two areas for, they can interact whatever the psychogenomic factors are involved, and then, inflammation. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:24:50
ERNEST ROSSI And there's a slight quivering of her eyelids, just reminds me of REM sleep, you know, when we're in our dream sleep, there's that characteristic movement. Yes, that's right, Mary. And audience can watch where I'm pointing, because I see some kind of behavior here that I don't know if it's voluntary or involuntary. But this is why I'd like to use hand processes that are so often symbolic of, reflective of the hidden unconscious so to speak. That's right, Mary. I'd like to have you feel what's really going on there. You notice how indirective I am. I say, Mary, I want you to really notice what's going on there, where? Let her decide. I have a... something I'm observing, I don't know whether she's observing it. So I'm very indirect. And we see this kind of opening symbolic, which to me it's a little bit like a flower opening. But again, that's Erne Rossi, I maybe projecting later, Mary could tell us what she's experiencing at this moment when I mention flower opening. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
ERNEST ROSSI And of course, Erne Rossi's therapeutic mind thinks of a flower opening as the essence of what, beauty, serenity certainly the opposite of over striving, pushing oneself too hard. Yes, I'm seeing a lot of behavior of this very characteristic of... That's right, Mary. Yes, that is very, very beautiful. I said art, beauty, and truth, I want to remind audience aren't just frills of life, but the essence of heightened, refined, sensibilities, the heightening of our best consciousness. And so, when I see (inaudible ) I point it out. Yes, again, this... from this to this opening, how beautiful. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:40
ERNEST ROSSI That's right, a deeper breath, but very, very gently now. There's a refinement taking place. There's an incredible refined sensibility. There's a parting of... 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, Mary. 

00:29:20
MARY MARONI (inaudible ) 

00:29:23
ERNEST ROSSI It's incredible smile do you have, what are you experiencing suddenly? 

00:29:25
MARY MARONI Well, I was thinking I was done. 

00:29:30
ERNEST ROSSI Say that again? 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN Mary was thinking maybe she's done. 

00:29:30
ERNEST ROSSI  She's done. Yes, indeed. Now this, I don't tell a person to go into trance, I don't tell them when they're done; they know when they're done and they spontaneously, I never told her to close her eyes, I would not presume. I let nature tell me that she closes her eyes as so she's going inside and then, what's it been? about...how long do you think we've been working here? 

00:29:55
MARY MARONI  10 minutes. 

00:30:00
ERNEST ROSSI 10 minutes. I implicit measuring it, but I think, it's at least 10 minutes, it's probably a little bit longer. So this time count us speeding up this time condensation, you might say, is the indication of creative work. Time always seems short when we're doing something important, I just want to give that sign. So you're seemed to be happy, smiling; your hand seems to be nicely together; what... hey, let me be a scientist, what number is your inflammation at now? 

00:30:35
MARY MARONI Oh... this is very difficult for me to choose a number. But I feel really quiet inside, so I think I could say, maybe, it's very low, maybe a zero or one. 

00:30:55
ERNEST ROSSI Zero or one, very low. And you profess that with the words, if you're, you used the word quiet, so you can quiet yourself and you can bring it from five to zero or one. Do you see how I'm working up to a client giving herself creating her own behavioral prescription? I listen carefully and do you sense now what you have to help yourself with the inflammation, this quietness and you have wonderful resources in your brain and your gut already. So if this is... she did a nice breath, she taking out relief. But we've got a little time, yeah. So let's explore just a little bit further, is that okay, Mary. 

00:31:50
MARY MARONI Hmmm. 

00:31:50
ERNEST ROSSI If... now this is an implicit processing heuristic. If your inner mind knows that, in fact, you can do this entirely on your own and you can give yourself this... these therapeutic suggestions of quieting, appropriately removing yourself several times a day from your excessive activity. If your unconscious mind knows it can't do that and if your conscious mind knows it can simply call for it, helping you recognize those times throughout the day when from my point of view, you're at the low-end of your basic rest activity cycle.

But then, every hour and a half, we also have to have a comfortable healing trough if your conscious and unconscious minds now understand how you can recognize when you need to give yourself a healing break throughout the day. Will those eyes again close more or less by them self, so you can go back inside and I don't know if you're gonna see yourself throughout your daily routine, how you will learn how to recognize when you need to take a break and have a healing session with yourself, if that's gonna be okay, let's see if those eyes close more or less by themselves, and you can just enjoy how you're going to experience this entirely on your own. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:34:30
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, really experiencing that as deeply as you need to. Do you can see allow my client to make a Darwinian selection as deeply as you need to experience your comfort. I'm always proffering, always offering and my offerings are, of course, therapeutic direction. So Mary can take pride in that wonderful brain that knows how to do intensive work out there, she just has to use that brain to also do appropriately a number of times a day to do the inner healing work. And it always comes at the trough of the cycle, if you're negative about that you say, oh! I'm fatigued, but if you tune into that fatigue, what a wonderful delicious comfort it turns out to be. Nature is poring out those comfort karma is wanting him to enjoy a healing rest. And the audience sees once again this characteristic, I call it like an opening flower. 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:45
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, fantastic. 

00:36:50
MARY MARONI I have a question. 

00:36:50
ERNEST ROSSI  Yes. 

00:36:55
MARY MARONI So let's pretend that several times a day or more I do this healing moments. 

00:37:05
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

00:37:05
MARY MARONI And ideally it's when that circadian rhythm is in the trough, right. 

00:37:10
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah, you're naturally feeling a little tired, if you're sensitive. 

00:37:15
MARY MARONI That would be how I would know. 

00:37:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, exactly. 

00:37:20
MARY MARONI I'm naturally feeling a little tired. 

00:37:20
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. You honor that tiredness, this is your inner nature calling saying, let me have the resources, let me have the energy to do what healing I can do. 

00:37:30
MARY MARONI Okay, so I could say to my nursing students, excuse me, I need to do a little healing now, it take five minutes. 

00:37:40
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, exactly. So the client gives herself the behavioral prescription of that(ph). Ah! what a relief. I don't have to be a genius as a psychotherapist, I can just relax, I can enjoy my work and the truth is who among us is so brilliant that we can follow and presume to program those million of the synaptic, trillions of synaptic connections. I've read a scientific excerpt, scientists saying there's more connections in the brain at any moment than there are elementary particles in the known universe, this is a big brain writing at the RNA and DNA. Yes, yes, little simply might sound mundane. When you feel tired, take a break because, it sounds I wrote a book called The 20 Minute Break years ago, just little baby book. But this is the more profound science I've learned about since I've wrote that book. Okay. Do you feel... what's the number now? 

00:38:55
MARY MARONI  Oh! It's just not even a number, it's just not there, it's zero. I feel very relaxed. 

00:39:05
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. And can you sense how that relaxation is a healing comfort. 

00:39:10
MARY MARONI Yes. 

00:39:10
ERNEST ROSSI  Yes. So I'm tying healing comfort on to her word relaxed, because relax isn't just, oh! relaxing, it's profound. Millions of genes are turning on in that so called relaxation. It's a profound healing state. 

00:39:35
MARY MARONI And so the key question is, is as these millions of relaxation genes are turning on is the inflammation gene turning off? 

00:39:45
ERNEST ROSSI  That's our assumption, yeah. Yeah. When I did this little... pathetically, little pilot study, it turned on the stem cell healing genes and simultaneously turned off the oxidation genes and the inflammation genes. But that study is such a tiny study, I wouldn't wanna make the whole, in other words, we need more research to document the science, but exactly there's a one little study just published in American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. We couldn't have planned the results better and it was statistically valid even though we had a small number of subjects. You want to turn on those stem cell healing genes and you want to turn off oxidation, which is lets leads to, literally burning up molecules, so it lowers your life extension and increases the aging process. You want to turn it off and you want to turn off the related inflammation. So the miracle for you, Mary is the precisely when you're enjoying a healing comfort, that's reducing the inflammation. And so far as our psychosocial genomic work, now there's also the medical world that works with drugs and, and namely you're going to need that help too, I don't know. But right now, what you're manifesting is optimal for the, what I call the psychosocial genomic healing experience. And your symptoms disappeared to me that's gotta mean something. I'll shut up now. 

00:41:35
MARY MARONI No. And I can choose to believe in your little pilot study. 

00:41:40
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah. Let's hope it's gonna grow with researchers jumping into the field. 

00:41:45
MARY MARONI Meanwhile, I'll believe in it. 

00:41:45
ERNEST ROSSI  Great. What a coincidence. We've only got two or three minute’s left. 

00:41:55
MARY MARONI Well I would like to tell you it's been an honor. 

00:41:55
ERNEST ROSSI  Okay. 

00:42:00
MARY MARONI Working with you and with your wife Kathryn. 

00:42:00
ERNEST ROSSI  Likewise for us. 

00:42:05
MARY MARONI Thank you. 

00:42:05
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you for volunteering and doing such wonderful, wonderful work. 

00:42:10
MARY MARONI Thank you. 

00:42:10
KATHRYN Very special Mary. 

00:42:10
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:42:10
KATHRYN  Oh! We need to microphone off. Erne, I think, we go till 10:15, do we not? So a good news, we've got a little bit more time. 

00:42:25
ERNEST ROSSI Oh! We have more time. Well, that's... 

00:42:25
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:42:25
ERNEST ROSSI I guess it's come to a natural conclusion. 

00:42:30
KATHRYN Oh! Thank you. 

00:42:30
ERNEST ROSSI  Okay. Let's hear a late question. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN  I was in your workshop yesterday and was stuck and I made a decision to 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN I made a decision to attend these meetings as possible of your sessions this weekend. And today, I was just following, just following your instructions to the participant? And one of the things that you said to her, really helped me a lot because before I was thinking I deal all these things one cell at a time and when you made this statement all those bacterial, those helpful bacterial, my inflammation is not in my intestines, it's in my lungs. But I was really amazed at the change from realizing that I could this one cell at a time. It was really nice. 

00:44:00
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:44:05
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:44:05
KATHRYN Thank you. 

00:44:05
ERNEST ROSSI Do you wanna summarize that for the audience, Kathryn? 

00:44:05
KATHRYN  Yes. This beautiful man was very touched by the experience that Mary had and it was an experience it resonated on the inside of himself even right now. 

00:44:25
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:44:25
KATHRYN Of understanding that about inflammation. 

00:44:30
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

00:44:30
KATHRYN And about the many genes that express themselves within the gut, the solar plexus and that it really is one gene at a time, and that one gene at a time for the healing. 

00:44:50
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah. 

00:44:50
KATHRYN And that, he's beautifully emotional right now... 

00:44:55
ERNEST ROSSI  What he felt(ph). 

00:45:00
KATHRYN You know how deeply it touched him. And so, your work today and your work yesterday has been a real healing transition for him. 

00:45:10
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Let's enjoy his experience for a moment. A wonderful audience can experience that analogous state within themselves just for a moment or two. You see, we've been been working for at least three quarter of an hour and now there's a natural tendency to relax and wow. So, maybe, all of us are can enjoy what I call the Ultradian Healing Response. How wonderful this new research that shows precisely when we allow ourselves healing relaxation that nature, Darwinian nature pours out healing, relaxing hormones. 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:35
ERNEST ROSSI And do we feel it, like Mary does in our gut the warmth, the healing, as well as our mind, a kind of serenity, a peaceful, in Sanskrit it's called Ananda, ananda, ananda. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:05
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, we need to enjoy this, at least, half a dozen times a day for life extension, for healing, for optimizing our natural creativity on many levels from mind to gene. 

00:47:45
[sil.] 

00:47:55
ERNEST ROSSI So as most of us continue with that for another couple of minutes. Let's see if someone else would like to say something in the microphone about their state at this moment? Are we really enjoying a group healing experience. Yes. 

00:48:20
MARK ROBINSON Hi, Dr. Rossi. I'm Mark Robinson from New Hampshire. Have you ever worked with cancer patients, huh, you know, cancer treatment is pretty archaic, its chemotherapy or a radiation and all these billions of dollars are spent on cancer research. Have used this type of technique on the cellular level with those type of individuals? 

00:48:40
ERNEST ROSSI Okay, Kathryn? 

00:48:40
KATHRYN Yes. He works with cancer patients. 

00:48:45
ERNEST ROSSI Cancer patients. 

00:48:45
KATHRYN Cancer patients. And he's wondering if you've ever used these kinds of techniques with cancer patients to help change them on a genomic level? 

00:49:05
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. I never had the pleasure, the honor of doing that but maybe if you have that kind of a population, I would love to cooperate with you in doing that. 

00:49:15
KATHRYN In doing research. 

00:49:15
ERNEST ROSSI  Yes. I mentoring research in a number of countries around the world. People who are starting to use this kind of a psychosocial genomic healing experience. And if I can help you in any way and I'm only one person, I'm a person in private practice you know, but I would like to believe that you could e-mail me at anytime and I would come up with some kind of a response, but you know I'm not an expert in everything. 

00:49:50
KATHRYN Really? 

00:49:50
ERNEST ROSSI Gee whiz. I mean, sometimes I feel I'm running myself a little bit ragged, but then when we come to this kind of a meeting it's a wonderfully unifying healing for us. That's based on the hard science and yet as in keeping... it's in rapport with what all the spiritual traditions of all cultures have been telling us for thousands of years. This goes all the way back to philosophy of love too in the Eastern, now Western tradition, it goes down back to the Pre-Socratics that said, what is life? What is the world? Well, there's the opposites of heaven; there's earth, there's light, there's darkness, there's thickness, there's hell, in another words there's continual dialog contending. I believe the hand process, I'm utilized accesses that natural duality between a problem and a resource bringing them together to promote optimal healing. And we've helped Mary with her inflammation, I'm sure at some level we could help cancer patients too, notice I'm not saying, I'm gonna cure, we're gonna cure cancer, but we're gonna optimize and it's not just one gene, but there's families of genes that come in with relaxation healing. I would say, we could help ameliorate symptoms, so whatever drugs or other medical interventions are required will be facilitated by our work. And we don't know where the line is between psychological and somatic, they're so intertwined, but they can cooperate and that's where I'm facilitating that cooperation. Okay. Let's have another question. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Since the world, especially here in our country a lot of trauma. Four ways trauma from war or combat, from sexual assault, from accidents, and from natural disasters. Is there evidence that this is working with trauma patients? 

00:52:15
KATHRYN  With trauma patients, there are so many people that have experienced traumas, you know, the wars, the sexual assaults, you know, the assault even, you know, the terrorist assaults, is there any evidence that this process might help people with trauma? 

00:52:40
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Here I have had some experience in my workshops around the world. In particular, in Israel I've had workshop with their soldiers and this is a process of what is the soldier? Is that the soldier going through the preliminary warmth and so forth. The initial simple dualities and you say, and which of those hands? Which side of you expresses the trauma with your symptoms? And they get that. And then I... in this, let me say, and what you've experienced on the other side, that's the opposite of your symptoms, and most of them are amazed. And they go through a hand process where they, again, they're essentially bringing together the opposites, the healing function with their traumatic function. I would love to do some DNA microarray studies of these patients, but I never had a chance to, so I only worked on the psychosocial level. Likewise in England, I worked with patients, soldiers who had amputations and phantom limb pain, and it's a cinch for them to, yeah, tune into the pain, phantom limb pain, and what do they feel in another part of the body, just the opposite of the pain. You know, it sounds so simple minded. You're bringing together the pain part of the brain where the pain is included with another part of their brain that knows how to experience comfort and you're saying do get out together guys, get together. And then, you see them going into all kinds of after the works going through completion. Today is stage three, before you see the pain side being enfolded by the comfort side, the healings side, and just identical with what every experience here. So I think this is a kind of a Rosetta Stone. These ancient philosophy that bringing together the Theory of Opposites, that was the first of the philosophies, both East and West. Carl Jung called it The Problem of The Opposites in his book, one of his books mysterium coniunctionis the Latin for mysterious conjunction. He got very close to what I do, and of course, I was trained as you in endless, of course, he died before we knew about the genomics of it. 

00:55:20
KATHRYN  I'd like to add something, Erne, that one of the most meaningful therapies within a group that I ever saw was in fact with a soldier in Israel. And he worked completely privately and when he was finished, he did share what was going on in the inside of him and his job as a soldier was to pick up the body parts and to bring them back and to try to identify them. And for 30 years every night he want to sleep and he had traumatic dreams and memories of what he had to do as a soldier. And he'd been many therapies just trying to resolve, you know, this PTSD. And during the process, he came to a stage three and his insight was different than ever before, and what he said was, that he gave something to the families. He couldn't deliver their sons and daughters as whole bodies, but he gave their families something, he helped to restore, you know, hundreds, if not thousands, of family members who could say goodbye in a physical way to their loved one and he felt like he was an angel of mercy for the first time in 30 years and we did follow up, and it did continue, he stopped having that traumatic night time dreams. 

00:57:05
ERNEST ROSSI That was a beautiful poignant tale that illustrates how do I conceptualize that? How do... what that... how did that therapeutic change take place? I would say, this is an example of a numinous metacognition. Previous to this, he was in nightmares repeating in his dreams, all the horror of trying to pick up body parts that belonged together. That was him, a scavenger on the fields of broken bodies but in this process, he was able to jump to another level, a meta level, a thinking about his thinking, a feeling about his feeling and suddenly it came to him as a stage three insight, oh! I'm an angel of, what was it you said, mercy? 

00:58:00
KATHRYN Angel of mercy. 

00:58:00
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. He got a whole new idea of himself, I'm an angel of mercy. And that, of course, that was the metacognition he's developed a new pattern of gene expression, a new neural network that placed picking up body parts in a new perspective, the perspective of the angel of mercy his higher self, so to speak, his metacognitions contained and ameliorated the pain of his, the horror of his daily work. So I did not, did nothing to get rid of the horror, I just helped him to develop a metacognition, and he put a label on it, just as Mary put a label, her metacognition was a piece of serenity in her brain and in her gut plexus area. So do we see how I call this creating new consciousness, this year will be... there will be a publication, the second volume of my selected papers and that's what I decided to call it, Creating New Consciousness all the way from mind to gene expression. Okay. We have time for just one more question. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Am I correct that this would be an application for issue such as asthma, which is a chronic inflammation that comes and goes. So that would be a physical symptom or maybe, you know, chronic pain? And I'm also wondering, it seems like it would be an application for the issue of forgiveness, which is where the rubber hits the road for most relationships? 

00:59:50
ERNEST ROSSI  Kathryn? 

00:59:55
KATHRYN So she has two ideas that she's wondering might be applications for the theory. One is, asthma, which is an inflammation asthma. 

01:00:05
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah. 

01:00:05
KATHRYN And the other is the concept of forgiveness, like with couples and, you know, and friends. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN Like with holding the bitterness on one side and accessing. 

01:00:15
KATHRYN You know, like holding the bitterness on one side and the opposite on the other. 

01:00:20
ERNEST ROSSI Exactly. 

01:00:20
KATHRYN For instance. 

01:00:20
ERNEST ROSSI And if it all possible to connect with molecular biologists that have a lab that can take blood samples or saliva samples, and sense what genes are turned on when your enter forgiveness and healing phase. In other words, that's we all have to do. I maintain that all of our paper and pencil tests that measure this quality and that quality, they're incomplete. All that cognitive behavioral research has to be supplemented by psychosocial genomic research, and then we'll have the whole picture. So I'm saying that most of our work on the cognitive behavior level, when it's limited to that, it's wonderful, wonderful work. But that's only, what, 40% of the... 

01:01:10
KATHRYN And we have to... 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN I see it as a compliment to the traditional therapeutic adding the biological element. 

01:01:15
KATHRYN  Thank you. She sees that adding the biological element... 

01:01:20
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

01:01:20
KATHRYN ...is I'll use a different word, it's golden to the treatments. 

01:01:25
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. Okay. 

01:01:25
KATHRYN Thank you so much. 

01:01:30
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you very much. 

01:01:30
