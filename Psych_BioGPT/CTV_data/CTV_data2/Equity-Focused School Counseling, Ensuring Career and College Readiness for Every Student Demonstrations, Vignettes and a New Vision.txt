00:00:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Welcome to equity-focused school counseling uh, ensuring career and college readiness for every uh, student. Uh, my name is Stuart Chen-Hayes. I'm associate professor of counselor education/school counseling at Lehman College of the City University of New York. 

00:00:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And my name is Ketrin Saud Maxwell. I'm assistant professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University and former director of a grant-funded program to train bilingual school counselors. 

00:00:50
DERYL BAILEY  And I'm Deryl Bailey, associate professor from University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. 

00:00:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL To work effectively in schools today school counselors need to expand their skills in the roles of collaborator, consultant, leader, advocate, culturally competent counselor in their work in the school counseling programs. And as school counselor profession evolves there are many school counselors, school counselor educators, counseling psychologist working with or training school counselors as well as supervisors in the field that have not been exposed to the contemporary models of school counseling practice. And therefore, what they seek is assistance in how to move in the new directions and the new paradigm of the school counseling profession. In addition, there are many graduate students in school counseling programs who are just beginning their journeys in understanding how to implement this new vision for school counseling. And what they want is real hands-on tools to assist that learning. So, this DVD will demonstrate transformative school counselor on knowledge, skills, and practices for pre and post service school counselors, for school counselor supervisors, for counselor educators, for school psychologists and really for anyone who wishes to know how to effectively work as transformative, equity-based school counselors. In addition to providing a basic understanding of this new vision of school counseling, the DVD will also present multiple skill- building vignettes, demonstrating key skills that school counselors need to developed to ensure that all students benefit from this new vision of the roles of the professional school counselor focused on equity, career, and college readiness for every student. 

00:03:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES One of our goals in creating the equity-focused to a counseling video is to have focus, have an idea of not only giving you the statewide(ph) most important things that are happening in the school counseling field right now, but also looking at how have we got into this place, and so I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about briefly the history of school counseling and our focus on primarily school counseling in the United States which certainly our interest is in taking the school bully(ph) and having an international perspective as well. School counseling began uh, in United States uh, out of the vocational guidance movement. And this was a movement that started in the late 1800's early 1900's as a way of uh, challenging the uh, great industrialization that have been happening in the workforce in the United States, and focus realizing in the progressive movement that there needed to be some sort of way to start helping people to look at uhm, what it meant to be uh, in a job or focusing on what we now call career counseling and career development, and so majority of school counseling initially started with the focus on high schools on looking at career development in terms of what was happening for uh, future workers in the society. Over time uh, in uh, 1920's and 1930's we had the Great Depression in the United States and then a lot of school counseling started to look at focus on employment, employment readiness and uh, was very much in the reaction of what was happening with the Depression. Uh, several decades after that with World War II uh, particularly in the 1950's we started see the movement of uh, the space race challenging the Soviet Union and in the United States, and this is the first time that huge amounts of funding became available for school counseling and school counseling programs. In the late '50's and early 1960's we saw a large numbers of land grant universities in the United States getting a large amounts of money to train school counselors. And initially school counselors were only at the high school level but over time focus realizing the importance of the... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ..developmental perspective and started to move toward middle school counselors and elementary school counselors as well. And so at the same time professional organization started to come up. The first profession organization to tie in to school counseling was the National Association for uh, College Admissions Counselors which began in the early 1930's. And then in the 1950's four organizations came together to form which is now known the American Counseling Association and this for organizations were the American School Counselor Association, the National Career Development Association, (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
DERYL BAILEY Hmm. 

00:05:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...the National Employment Counselor Association, and the American College Personnel Association. It's interesting as we look back now in time to look at those four organizations really keys the part of what we're talking about in equity-focused school counseling: ensuring career and college readiness for every student. And so after the 1960's one of the things that we found was that a focused came in on personal/social issues, uh, a focused on community mental health and so the original focused on career began to shift toward the personal and social uh, and then some persons also started to look at what are the academic issues related to elementary, middle, and high school levels. And so in the United States uh, school counseling is always been very much involved with the political contexts and so I talked about in the 1950's what was going on of the space race and then in the 1960's the, the funding for community mental health. In the 1970's and 80's there was a lot of talk about school reform and our public schools in United States really doing for all students what they need to be doing. Uh, and school counseling had pretty much been reactive at this point in time in terms of what was going on. There was a man named uh, Professor Norman Geisbergs(ph) who in the late 60's early 70's really moved away from the idea of having one school counselor as an individual to focusing on the entire school on an entire school... (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...counseling program. And so what services will be delivered to all students in the school and he with a group of colleagues initiated a whole group of research that was unpublished in the 1990's showing the efficacy of what happens for students who are involved in uh, fully implemented school counseling programs. Along that time uh, toward the early to mid- 1990's uh, in reaction to what was happening uh, around the country with the, the focus on uh, the standard space movement and really looking at quality education for all students American School Counseling Association developed uh, the first set of national standards called the ASCA National Standards. Uh, (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ....two uh, school counselor educators Carol D. Hill(ph) and Shery Campbell(ph) put together for the first time the national standards for school counseling. And they were in three domains: Academic development, career development, and personal/social development, and so out of this idea of uh, national standards was really the first time that there was a language to put together for all schools elementary, middle and high school about here are the things that we expect, the competencies that we want school counselors to be delivering in a school counseling program. Also at this time in the late 1990's there was a group uh, put together uh, questioning what was the role of school counselors? (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So one of the challenges in the profession has been exactly what the school... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
DERYL BAILEY Hmm. 

00:08:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...counselors do. 

00:08:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES And we like to think that now we're in a much better place about that and pretty clear about the role of school counselors at least in the United States. 

00:08:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so a group called the Education Trust, which is the country's largest nonprofit devoted to closing achievement on opportunity gaps uh, put together uh, a series of focus groups under the work of a woman named uh, Patricia Martin. And Pat Martin work as a school counselor, a Math teacher, a building administrator, a district supervisor uh, and she was hired by the Ed Trust to, to look at how could we really shift to a model of equity in focusing school counseling, and how can we shift school counselors start helping to close achievement and opportunity gaps. And over time the work that she developed look at focus groups asking students, parents, and guardians, teachers, and counselor educators and principals, what is that the school counselors do, what is that that they should be doing, and out of that the Ed Trust created a group called the National Center for Transforming School Counseling, and they created a model looking at exactly as uh, Doctor Saud Maxwell talked about the need to really transform how school counselors are prepared and how school counselors deliver their services in districts uh, around the United States. And so that work uh, moved into uh, uh, or paralleled with uh, work with the American Counselor Association also uh, uh, put into practice in the late 1990's and the early 2000's. American School Counseling Association recognized out of the work of Norman Geisberg(ph), the work of Carrie and Sharon Johnson(ph), the work of Kelthy Hear(ph), the work of the Ed Trust's Transforming School Counseling that they needed to developed a national program model, and so in 2002 the American School Counseling Association developed the ASCA national model for school counseling programs. And this was the first time that a variety of the best theories in school counseling are put together. And so uh, the framework is seen as a diamond with four major areas, accountability, foundation, delivery systems, and management systems. And so part of what we look for school counselors and school counselor supervisors should trained in how to do a program-based model. Now also in the 2000's uh, we've seen all sorts of other uh, things occurred. In addition to the implementation of the ASCA National Model a group came together called the Center for School Counseling Outcome Research at the University of Massachusetts. Uh, Doctors Carrie Demitt(ph) and Doctor Jay Curry(ph) uh, co-direct the center and the idea was that school counselors need to be using outcome research and evidence based practice in everything that we do also in the idea of not only giving like competencies and academic uh, career college and personal or social development but ensuring that there is research based evidence and clear outcome so that school counselors gonna tie the work that we do to everything else that's happening in schools. And then in addition uh, Pat Martin left the Education Trust and in uh, about 2004 she was hired by the college board to create what is now known as the National Office for School Counselor Advocacy. And this office was uh, focused solely on equity issues and the realization that many students in the United States were not getting the college readiness consent that they needed often nothing mean down at the elementary lot of, level, a little or nothing at the middle school level and maybe a little bit at junior/senior level in high school, and what we've realized is that school counselors played a dramatic and critical role in getting college readiness to students K through 12 and all the way through uh, college as well. And so NOSCA created a, a, a consortium of which all three of us were involved... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm(ph). 

00:11:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...uh, to work to ensure college readiness skills for all school counselors as well. Uh, and so that brings us up into where we are in terms of the history of school counseling. 

00:12:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES We should also say that uh, Doctor Deryl Bailey uh, at University of Georgia you are one of the original six granted schools... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
DERYL BAILEY Yes, we were. 

00:12:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...in the Transforming School Counseling Movement received the half million grant with colleague... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
DERYL BAILEY True(ph). 

00:12:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...Doctor Pam Pasley(ph). Uh, and then Lehman College where I teach was one of the original companion institutions, we didn't received the half million dollars... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:12:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...but did all the... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...work to transform our school counseling program, we now have 30 uh, counselors at school counseling programs around(ph) the country that have done that. 

00:12:35
DERYL BAILEY In the state of Georgia where now the board of regents has declared it so that all the school counselor's uhm, training programs must look like ours. 

00:12:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Excellent (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Excellent task(ph), excellent. So our work and uh, Doctor Saud Maxwell you work with the ACCESS uh, bilingual transform school counseling grant has meant that this really is nationwide. 

00:12:55
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:12:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  And that we have all states that are now doing this lots of a trust that has now done the work in over a hundred districts, major cities, rural areas as well. This is a model for all students cities, suburb (inaudible ) rural. (crosstalk) 

00:13:11
DERYL BAILEY Like(ph) rural. 

00:13:11
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:13:11
STUART CHEN-HAYES Exactly. Well, let's talk a little bit now about this new vision of transform school counseling. The idea of equity for every student through the acronyms that we used are ACCESS and TACKLE. (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
DERYL BAILEY TACKLE. 

00:13:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so this work uh, originated from the Education Trusts uh, National Standard for Transforming School Counseling. And the easiest way for counselors to remember what we're attempting to do are the acronyms ACCESS and TACKLE. And so we want to give away K through 12 and all of our school counseling programs, the ACCESS competencies. An ACCESS stands for academic competencies and skills, career competencies and skills, college readiness competencies and skills, emotional and personal competencies, competencies and skills and social and cultural competencies and skills, and so our goal is to have every student be able to have uh, ACCESS skills from transformed school counselors kindergarten through 12. Okay, the concept TACKLE takes the Education Trust transform vision skills and puts them into a very specific skills that school counselors need. Counseling skills were important but they are not sufficient if we are to equity-focused and close achievement, opportunity, attainment, and funding gaps. 

00:14:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so the concept of TACKLE includes uh, uh, the T stands for teaming and collaboration uh, as you see in the vignettes that we do throughout it's not just school counselors working with students, we have parents and guardians, (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:14:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...we have teachers and we have building leaders including principals. In order to really close gaps and get the skills going school counselors can't be the little(ph) ranger we have to have a lot of help. 

00:14:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES And if we're only gonna do this we have to work in outside our offices and in classrooms not only behind close doors. The second area of TACKLE is advocacy. We need to be advocating for all students in particular students who've not have the resources or access to career and college readiness than those students have. So, English language learners, bilingual students, students of color particularly African-American, Latino/Latina, and native American students, students with disabilities be they physical, learning, emotional and or developmental, and students who are poor and are working class. Traditionally, those four groups of students had been the students who's schools and school counseling programs have been the least successful for, (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...our work is to turn that around. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Yeah(ph). 

00:15:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES The C uh, stands for in TACKLE culturally competent counseling and progra, program coordination and so not only culturally competent counseling individual and group.... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and family but how we work with developing, designing, implementing and evaluating school counseling programs to sure that they meet, ensure that they meet the needs of all students. The K stands for knowledge and use of technology uh, while paper and pencil and chalk can be considered technology we wanna make sure that school counselors are using computers, are using computer based uh, assistance for career readiness, for college readiness uh, using power points uh, doing everything that they can uh, to use technology to promote the readiness of all students... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...in schools. And use of technology also means that for public schools we look at what are the school's report cards, where is the data, how can we take that data, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and move it to close gaps in our schools. Uh, the L stands for leadership. We see school counselors as leaders in schools. It is critical that school counselors see themselves as leaders and that they work with the other leaders in and outside of schools. And so leaders promote advocacy, leaders promote equity and ensure that all students are getting what they need uh, to reach their dreams. And last but not the least the E stands for equity assessment using data, and so the role of transform school counselors just to look at the equity issues, who is getting services in the school, who is not, how we can turn that around, uhm, who is doing really well on standardized test and who is not, who is getting career and college readiness and who is not, what are the things that we can used, what are the data points that we can look at and then transform... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
DERYL BAILEY Hmm. 

00:17:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...through doing our work. 

00:17:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, that's the new vision ACCESS and TACKLE of transform school counselors. (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
DERYL BAILEY They can (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:17:22
STUART CHEN-HAYES The next area is the college and career readiness context to school counseling and our focus is on closing achievement, attainment, funding, and opportunity gaps. And so achievement gaps are basically the gaps that we see in academic- 

00:17:35
Achievement Gap The difference in academic performance seen between groups of K-12 students when data is disaggregated by various cultural variables including ethnicity/race, gender, social class, disability status, language status, and other variables. 

00:17:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES -performance that differ across different groups of students and so we know that in the United States there are schools that have performed with, all students doing very, very well uh, by race, by ethnicity, by social class, by ability, disability level, by English language, and learning level but we also know that there are wide gaps that not all schools are doing that. (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES So transform school counseling is looking at what can we do to close this achievement gaps. What can we do with individual counseling, with group counseling and with developmental... (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:18:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...school counseling lessons to help close achievement gaps in schools. 

00:18:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah(ph). 

00:18:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES The second gap that we are working on are attainment gap. An attainment gaps are who by- 

00:18:15
Attainment Gap The difference in who receives college diplomas and who does not based on data disaggregated by ethnicity/race, gender, social class, disability, and language identities, among others. 

00:18:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES -different cultural groups are graduating with college diplomas and who are not. 

00:18:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so we know overwhelmingly that in the United States currently persons of Asian ethnic and racial identities are graduate with highest percentage of diplomas of any of the major ethnic and racial groups followed by European Americans. 

00:18:30
DERYL BAILEY Hmm. 

00:18:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Groups that are not doing as well but, but we want to work on uh, persons of African descent, (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...persons who are Latino or Latina, and native American, and are indigenous persons specific islanders. 

00:18:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so our work is how do we ensure that one day that all students of all ethnic and racial groups are graduate and with college diplomas. Similarly if we look at social class. We know that wealthy students and upper middle-class students are much more likely to be graduating with college diplomas than lower middle-class, and poor and working class students, and so our work is how do we give the tools in terms of college readiness and career development so that our students by the time they graduate from high school will be successful going off to college and graduating as well. 

00:19:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Funding gaps are- 

00:19:15
Funding Gap The difference in public tax dollars per student spent on education in poor public school districts versus wealthier public school districts. 

00:19:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES  -the wide disparities that we see in the amount of money that's given to rural and urban students... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...in the United States versus often suburban students although that's not exact. There are some suburbans students that get a lot of money and there are some suburban students that... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:19:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...don't get much. But the issue is that in most states we still, our funding public schools via a tax based, and it's the tax based that is the uh, decider right now who gets goodies, who gets resources and who doesn't. 

00:19:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah. 

00:19:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so our work is how do we transform school counselor and school counseling programs to focus on the funding gaps. And although certain schools may not have a lot of money what's the best way that we can use school counselors and school counseling programs to get the resources to all students. And then last we wanna look at opportunity gaps. 

00:20:05
Opportunity Gap The difference in resources given to students including: quality of instruction, college-preparatory curriculum, quality of teachers, access to a school counseling program, access to career and college development skills and counseling, and other opportunities that make a difference in who has the access to go to college and high-paying careers and who does not. 

00:20:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES And school counselors have been very much at the center of either helping to challenge opportunity gaps or not noticing them... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah. Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...over the history of school counseling. An opportunity gaps are who's getting career and college readiness... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
DERYL BAILEY  Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and who's not in elementary, middle, and high schools. Who's getting access to advance placement in international baccalaureate, in honor(ph) courses and who is not. Who are the gatekeepers that are keeping the status quo that are saying things like, oh, those are college bound students, well why aren't we creating every student to be college bound and career ready. 

00:20:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES We're not saying that all students will go to college. That's not our role here but our role is we shouldn't be the ones deciding. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
DERYL BAILEY Deciding(ph), yeah. 

00:20:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES We wanna make sure that every student is prepared and ready so that they can make that choice of the full range of career dreams, the full range of post secondary opportunities... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...including college. 

00:20:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah, I think that's a very important point that Doctor Chen-Hayes has made because it's not as if we're saying every student has to go to college. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Correct. 

00:21:05
DERYL BAILEY Right(ph). 

00:21:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL It's just that we, what we're saying is we need to make sure that every student is ready. 

00:21:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Correct. 

00:21:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So if in fact they choose to they can. And that's a very liberating. 

00:21:15
DERYL BAILEY Right. Making sure that every student has college as an option for themselves... (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

00:21:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Exactly. 

00:21:15
DERYL BAILEY  is, is, is what we're about. 

00:21:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Exactly. 

00:21:20
DERYL BAILEY That should be about. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Exactly, it's all about hopes and dreams. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES We were all about getting focus to their greatest hopes and dreams. 

00:21:25
DERYL BAILEY Right(ph). 

00:21:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES But you can't do that if you only see the school counselor in the second semester in senior year... (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
DERYL BAILEY Yeah. 

00:21:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...for career and college readiness. That's 12 years too late. 

00:21:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES The Education Trust talks about one of their matters is college begins in kindergarten. 

00:21:35
DERYL BAILEY  Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES And we would like to appropriate that for this work 'coz all we know that good college and career readiness developing the ACCESS and the TACKLE skills needs to start in kindergarten and go all the way... (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES  through the 12th grade. 

00:21:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. And so based on what Doctor Chen-Hayes said uhm, what we're about is equity-focus school counseling program so we're moving away from that... (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm(ph). 

00:22:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...idea of just working one on one with any individual, and really have more of a systemic and community perspective so that we can really help our students reach those hopes and dreams and that's what we as counselors were about. 

00:22:15
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:22:18
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL We want our students to reach those hopes and dreams. And so to be effective in schools today we need to use those equity based TACKLE skills which Doctor Chen-Hayes uhm, talked about. The teaming and collaboration, advocating, providing culturally competent counseling, knowing used technology lead(ph), uhm, and ACCESS equity using data. It's also very helpful for school, school counselors to be knowledgeable about a comprehensive developmental standards based school counseling program such as the one uhm, from the American School Counseling Association a framework for school counseling programs. Uhm, one of the very nice parts and there are many nice parts of this model, one of the very nice parts is that there are many artifacts in this model... (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
 Hmm. 

00:23:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  that can be used to demonstrate successful outcomes and that is very important in the time like today where we need to show outcomes otherwise school counselors are seemed as superfluous and we will not really have the jobs... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...in this day in age. 

00:23:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So artifacts such as action plans, result reports, program audit, school counseling program calendars those are all things that are very visible, very hands-on... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...things that administrators, principals want to look at. Uhm, and I, and I think I show this because as a counseling I was trained as a counseling psychologist and so I was trained much... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  more in that individual model which I think is a wonderful model. However, to work in the context of schools and to make sure that we're making a difference and that we have a job. (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And it's not that I'm saying that we all, that our major purpose is have our job, I think our major purpose is to make a difference in the lives... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...of our students and families... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL But unless we can show we make the difference we're not going to have a job. 

00:24:05
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

00:24:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
DERYL BAILEY This thing artifacts actually make our jobs easier for us. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

00:24:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
DERYL BAILEY It's with organizing in the work that we do to make sure that we're reaching all kids who need uh, uh, to be reached. And again I just want the, the piece(ph) was about you know we're not eliminating individual counseling. 

00:24:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Correct. 

00:24:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. 

00:24:20
DERYL BAILEY Uhm, we're, we're to being, would find to find, we're in creating other way to do in that type of counseling to make sure that we're, that will send more students uhm, on a regular basis. 

00:24:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. And I think what Doctor Bailey said to is we're also not trying to work harder but we're trying to work smarter. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
DERYL BAILEY Work smarter, absolutely. 

00:24:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And that's very important. Uhm, so these artifacts that are found in uhm, American School Counseling Association the model is very helpful for our work, and uhm, so the following vignettes that we're going to be showing today are actual scenarios from actual issues facing elementary, middle, and high school counselors in urban areas, in suburban areas and rural areas. Uhm, they show uhm, in a very vivid way hopefully that school counselors can used micro skills to advance the TACKLE themes and the ACCESSS skills that Doctor Chen-Hayes was talking about. And to provide equity and access for every student, not just some students but for every student. 

00:25:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, I wanna thank you Doctor Bailey and Doctor Saud Maxwell for joining us on this journey... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:30

00:25:35
DERYL BAILEY  Thank you. 

00:25:40

00:26:55
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES So remind me again to sum up. What were the most important things, your dreams in terms of the career that you'd like to have? 

00:27:00
ALEX FALTER Okay. A co, a video game creator, a movie star and movie cre, producer. 

00:27:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so your three top interest were all very interrelated. You want to be a video game producer, a movie uh, (crosstalk)

ALEX FALTER Producer. 

00:27:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...producer, and or a movie star. (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
ALEX FALTER A movie star. 

00:27:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, so in order to reach those three career dreams what are you gonna need to study through middle school, high school and then after high school, post secondary including college? 

00:27:30
ALEX FALTER  Well, for video game I think I'll have to study the history of game, making games. 

00:27:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
ALEX FALTER For movies I think I'll have to do, I'll have to find out how other, how other movies are just so popular like, like behind the scenes and things, what makes it popular, and then to be a movie star I'll have to practice, I'll have to practice on how to be acting. 

00:27:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
ALEX FALTER Like I do after school. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay so that all sounds good. Let's really focus on the connections to academic subjects. 

00:28:00
ALEX FALTER  Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES What about literacy are you gonna need to read and be able to write with your own? 

00:28:05

00:28:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

00:28:10
ALEX FALTER ...for the movies.

STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So studying English and what are the languages are you interested in? 

00:28:15
ALEX FALTER Hmm, not, really and the other was... (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Not at all? 

00:28:15
ALEX FALTER ...by able to do that tinee(ph) I get, by doing a count of 10 it's to be on the (inaudible ) communications(ph). 

00:28:22
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. (crosstalk) 

00:28:22
ALEX FALTER Something like that. 

00:28:22
STUART CHEN-HAYES So English and some Español because of you have two languages you have more access to more opportunities, all right? 

00:28:30
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES And what about Math are you gonna need to count anything as a video game designer or... (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
ALEX FALTER For points. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...a director? 

00:28:35
ALEX FALTER For sco, your score. 

00:28:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. All right so you count up scoring and then points and all of that, okay. How about Science anything related to the science of video or film making? 

00:28:45
ALEX FALTER  Hmm, well, not really. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES No. 

00:28:50
ALEX FALTER Well, I can't, like, well the other boys, I don't really see any Science on it. Unless... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
ALEX FALTER ...you wanna create a Science movie. 

00:29:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Now that could be yes. You might wanna set and design studio. And you already talked about the history of video making or making games so that sound like a majority of academic subjects that you need to study. 

00:29:10
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, so what are your best subjects in the school in this areas of this? Which do you like the best? 

00:29:15
ALEX FALTER And I will, like my favorite out of those three things that I wanna be? 

00:29:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
ALEX FALTER  I'd say video game creator. 

00:29:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, so now let's go back to what you're gonna be studying in school. Are your favorite subjects Math or Literacy, English, Spanish, Science, History? 

00:29:30
ALEX FALTER Well, of all, of those all that there's two History and, there are three History, Science and Math. 

00:29:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, so actually. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
ALEX FALTER I like easy Math facts(ph). 

00:29:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Easy Math facts(ph), uh-huh. 

00:29:45
ALEX FALTER Yeah. 

00:29:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, those were a good match in terms of those areas for your career dreams. All right, so what kind of college or post secondary education are you gonna need in order to become one of those career dreams? 

00:29:55
ALEX FALTER  Uhm, you had degree, a master's degree. 

00:30:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES A master's degree? 

00:30:00
ALEX FALTER Yes. 

00:30:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Do you know on what field? 

00:30:00
ALEX FALTER  For video, for making game, video games. 

00:30:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, do they give master's degrees in video game making? 

00:30:05
ALEX FALTER Uh, I'm not really sure. 

00:30:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES That be a good thing for us to check out. So one of the things I wanna do is to follow up with you about how do we find out what exactly you're gonna need to study after high school to become a video game maker. Uh, there are fine arts or graphic design... (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...uh, those might be things and those usually would require at least an associate's degree or a bachelor's degree. 

00:30:30
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh, you could go to a school of drama. 

00:30:35
ALEX FALTER Yes. 

00:30:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Those are possibilities too to be an actor also certain things like that. 

00:30:40
ALEX FALTER Yes. 

00:30:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, if you think about what you wanna do for career and, and college, your dreams on what you wanna do uhm, how will that help you when things get tough in the classroom with your current teacher? 

00:30:50
ALEX FALTER Well, the acting can kinda help me control my feelings. 

00:30:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Great, so you can pretend you're a really wonderful actor and you have everything under control in class. 

00:31:00
ALEX FALTER Yes. 

00:31:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And then when you get upset you can talk to either me as your school counselor or your parent at home or to your friends after the class and certainly talk to the teacher after the class too. 

00:31:10
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. Good. All right. 

00:31:15
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, uhm, anything else that you like to share with me before we end up? 

00:31:15
ALEX FALTER  Well, like for another job or something? 

00:31:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Could be whatever you wanna say. 

00:31:20
ALEX FALTER  Well, I'd like to say that I (inaudible ) about the movies, I uh, after school on Thursday night I take this movie making class. 

00:31:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
ALEX FALTER And we can make movies and I got a disc for the movies that we filmed, and the type that we've done are comedies. I like more of science and then a one horror movie. 

00:31:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Cool. 

00:31:45
ALEX FALTER Yes, very cool. 

00:31:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, and could you maybe bring that in some time to show me, or show your whole class, or show the whole school? 

00:31:50
ALEX FALTER Maybe I could. 

00:31:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES That would be great because I don't think most kids have access to a movie making class at your age. 

00:31:55
ALEX FALTER Five movies we made. 

00:31:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Wow, amazing. Well, I'd love to see that. Well, Alex I'd like to thank you. It's been really fun working with you in school counseling. I wish you all the best and we'll be in touch soon. 

00:32:05
ALEX FALTER Uh hmm. I hope to see you again in a couple of days. 

00:32:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES  You got it. Bye-bye. 

00:32:10
ALEX FALTER Okay, okay bye-bye. 

00:32:10
Vignette 1 Part B 

00:32:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES  So, I know you're really busy Mr. Houlihan. And I'm really appreciative all your principal duties that you could take a couple of minutes and come, talk with us about what's going on. 

00:32:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Sure. 

00:32:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And I certainly appreciate too uhm, Mrs. Roberts uh, your being here as well. 

00:32:25
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES So uhm, what, my concern is that uh, and we talked about this a little before uh, I've now had six of your students with disabilities come to see me for individual counseling. 

00:32:35
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES  They've all done really well, we've work on pretty much the same issues. We've worked on anger management, stress management, a lot of stuff related to the study skills and how to be more appropriate in the classroom setting, (clears throat) but I feel like I'm using all of my time individually to keep working with the same... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Hmm. 

00:32:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...students with the same issues. And I would like to propose that I stop working with the students individually and instead that I come into your classroom and maybe co-teach or even teach on my own developmental lessons that will teach the whole class, the various skills that I've been doing one on one. So, stress management, anger management, how to get along with each other in class things like that, uh, and I know in the school traditionally with IEP's school counselors have only done individually counseling, a little bit of group, I could have done group but you know six and they're all at different times it wouldn't really have work, but I'd like to be preventive at this point. I fell like I'm being reactive. 

00:33:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES You're, you're giving me whatever goes on or I work with that well, I think I could be serving more students more effectively in working on the closing the gap line... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...with our students with disabilities if I came in their classroom and stand. What do you all think? 

00:33:45
LAURA ROBERTS Well, I, I feel that the individual counseling has worked very well at this point. My concern about having you come into classroom is first of all you're not a teacher, no offence uhm, second of all it might be very disruptive because we have a lot of focus and emphasis on academics at this time, not every child has the same needs or same behavior problems or uhm, concerns so I really feel that the individual counseling has been great at this point. I would like to stick with that. 

00:34:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN One of the things I, I did hear Mr. Chen-Hayes say though is that uh, he's had six students, correct? 

00:34:20
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN And it sounds to me like it was in a, in a short period of time and there are similar issues, so I'm, I'm all about you know how, how to sort of make you know, a, a person's job here a little bit easier and reach as many as students as possible. Uh, I'm, I'm very open to the idea of, of even co- teacher you know. 

00:34:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
LAURA ROBERTS I guess my question is what would that look like exactly? 

00:34:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Sure. Uh, I think you and I can work together. I'd be happy to collaborate I certainly do not see myself as a teacher but I see myself as an educator along with the two of you in the school. 

00:35:00
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so one of the things that I'm interested in this implementing a developmental school counseling program for the entire school and it's not just doing individually group counseling, a huge part of giving the competencies away is doing developmental lessons. I don't have to do them. I couldn't work with you on them you could deliver them... (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...or we could do it together. But I think the issue is that there are these skills and competencies all of our students need... (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...I won't be able to deliver them to all students if I keep doing in one on one individually. And so the way that it would look is that we could sit down and we could plan out uhm, I could take the material that I've used uhm, which comes from evident space sources and so there is a research base behind of what I'm attempting to implement but my biggest goals to be proactive, to not be reactive 'coz I'm suspicious if I've had six that there are probably six more lurking in the wings. 

00:35:50
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES And you've been great about referring to me but I think this would be a better use of my time and would actually keep students in your class more or rather than sending them out to work with me. 

00:36:00
LAURA ROBERTS  Okay, and you have training in this area also... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
LAURA ROBERTS ...so you know. 

00:36:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES In my graduate school counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
LAURA ROBERTS Okay. 

00:36:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...program we had to do tens of lesson plans and deliver and get feedback and I have them all available if you wanna look at them, but we don't have to take what I have we could certainly come up with our own, but I have a, a whole model and because we're in, you know, everything is about getting our test scores up than a... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

00:36:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...data driven model, uhm, we could very much create the baseline for each student look at where they're at. We could also compare the students who've gone through individual counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
LAURA ROBERTS Uh-huh. 

00:36:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...with those that had not but since they have gone through that they'd be a real support for all the students that are in there now. And In terms of curriculum I probably do it during like literacy period so they could write essays or do things that will be building their literacy skills at the same time, so be, at both end I don't see this is add on or push in I see it as very collaborative. How does that sound? 

00:36:50
LAURA ROBERTS  Actually that sound appealing. I like the idea of you know bringing it together with another subject rather than just adding in something else... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:37:00
LAURA ROBERTS ...because as you know we are on a time constraint. Uhm, and I will admit I do have some other minor behavior problems I do think that everyone could benefit. Uhm, I like the idea of, of just being a proactive approach... (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:10
LAURA ROBERTS ...as well. And I'd be open to it. 

00:37:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES 'Coz I think you will see that you'll have your time for freed up to do things and then focus on student behavior... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

00:37:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...in this way we're really working as a team as oppose to you in the classroom and me in my office, we can then be working as a team in your classroom and obviously if we do identify the students I can work individually or you may decide we want to put a bunch into a group and do a group or hold off for awhile so that I can then free at my time to go to lessons in other classrooms and do more group related work too, yeah. 

00:37:40
LAURA ROBERTS Okay. 

00:37:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES  All right. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN That sounds good to me. 

00:37:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES I appreciate your time and why don't you and I set a time to figure out where we can meet X(ph) and... (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
LAURA ROBERTS Okay. 

00:37:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...we'll go from then. All right. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
LAURA ROBERTS Thank you. 

00:37:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Thank you. 

00:37:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Thank you. 

00:37:55
Vignette 2 College and Career Readiness for Every Student 

00:37:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  This vignette is college and career readiness for every student and which we'll see here is Suzette is a rising sophomore in high school. I(ph) am a new school counselor at a large high school. And I have just found out that no one has had any career or college readiness work, uh, in the elementary, middle or high schools in this particular school. I will work with Suzette briefly and then I will work with her building principal and a teacher on how to get career and college readiness for all students in this high school and hopefully earlier in this district. 

00:38:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Suzette, I'm so glad that you can come by today. 

00:38:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh, do you have any idea why I asked you to come down to the school counseling office? 

00:38:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  No I just came because you said to come. 

00:38:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Well, one of my goals is I'm trying to meet all the students on my caseload... (crosstalk) 

00:38:45

00:40:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So who has helped you with that along going in schools. Have you gotten any help from school counselors or teachers? 

00:40:05

00:40:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

00:40:05
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR ...like her that's why I wanna do it. 

00:40:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. All right. So, you've talked about you've got some family members who helped you out. Has a school counselor ever done any career development with you so far? 

00:40:15
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  No. I don't even know what career development. What you mean with that(ph). 

00:40:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Helping you figure out what you wanna do with your life. 

00:40:25
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uh-uh. 

00:40:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES No, okay. All right. How about uh, your plans for after high school, post secondary, would you like to go to college? 

00:40:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Yeah. 

00:40:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR My friends are the one that I wanna go. 

00:40:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...if you'd like to go who has helped you so far in terms of planning for college, school counselors or teachers in the school? 

00:40:40
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Oh, no, no. 

00:40:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So uh, this year, sophomore year generally people do the PSAT have you heard about that? 

00:40:50
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  No. 

00:40:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. PSAT is something that sophomores do uh, it's a pre uh, college readiness examination, can help you look at the areas that you need to study, work harder on before you take the SAT which... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...is one of a couple of standardize pre-college admissions exam. Have you heard of the SAT or the ACT? 

00:41:15
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR I heard about the SAT's. 

00:41:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. All right. So, the PSAT is usually, usually done in the sophomore year. So, it sounds to me like what I've heard from everyone else in your co-work(ph) that no one has done any career and college readiness work for you, not yet, so it's time to change that. So, why don't I give you a couple of things that you can look at now. 

00:41:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES I'm gonna work uh, with the principal and some teachers and see if we can start doing this systemically... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...for the sophomore class, in the junior class, in the seniors, in the freshmen next year as well. There's something called uh, CareerZone. 

00:41:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR CareerZone? 

00:41:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES It's online and it's free. 

00:41:50
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh, and so that's something you can look at right away and you can begin to just explore for free what's going on in terms of career development. 

00:41:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:41:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES There's another something called the career key, that's also online, that's also free, something you can use and look at, I just wanna give you a couple of things right away. Uh, there's a company called the College Board, which is a nonprofit. It, it administers AP exams. Have you heard of what AP exams are? 

00:42:15
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR No. 

00:42:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Advanced placements, okay. 

00:42:15
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES We're here in sophomore year and you need to know what AP courses are. 

00:42:20
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uhm, Mr. Chen-Hayes is this homework that you're giving me that I have to do? 

00:42:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh, I wouldn't call it homework I'd say if you're interested the things you could look at... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...with the things that it will definitely bring you to down the road. 

00:42:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Where either gonna do this hopefully as classroom lessons, a large group activities. 

00:42:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES One of my goals since you'll be on my caseload next year as well, there's school counselors to make sure you know what all this things are... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...uh, as quickly as we can. 

00:42:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:42:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uhm, there's something a college board does that I'm gonna see, when you get in this school that is called my road, and it's an entire career and college readiness uh, online program that you can use. You have access to a computer? 

00:42:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Yes. 

00:42:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, to online? 

00:43:00
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Yes. 

00:43:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, all right. So, this is something that I'm hopeful that we can do as well. So, one of the things you can start to do is look at colleges online, you can start uh, Google... (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:43:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and search for which schools you might have your interest, and how would you help to start to look at, which school that I wanna go to, would it be two-year or four-year uhm, what kind of environment, a pay for college, uh, what are the exams that I need to get in, (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...what kind of grades do I need to have, what kind of courses do I need. Uhm, are you taking honor's course right now or you're taking. 

00:43:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR No. 

00:43:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES No, all right. 

00:43:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR No. 

00:43:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, one of the things that we know is that we can get you into some honors in some AP courses uh, I don't think the school offers international baccalaureate but if it did that will be another area. Things that will help you. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR I don't know what that means too. 

00:43:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. International baccalaureate is a uh, diploma program that's recognized around the world. 

00:43:50
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:43:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES It's kind of the equivalent of doing AP courses. 

00:43:50
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:43:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES It's, it's a curriculum that helps ensure students for college ready. 

00:43:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:43:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES And that's what we wanna look at is to make sure that you are taking courses that really challenge you, that will ensure that you graduate and that colleges will say, wow they have really strong curriculum, really strong things. 

00:44:10
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:44:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so that's part of what we'll be working on. 

00:44:10
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:44:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uhm, another website that I, and, and share for you when your family look at is called NACAC, the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, and so that along with the college board website, www.collegeboard.com. 

00:44:25
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And then I gave you the career key and, and the uh, uh, the CareerZone as, as other potential resources as well. 

00:44:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  Okay. 

00:44:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES So you called look at any of those on your own, no pressure but I just wanna give you some things off at the top of my head. Things that I used that I'll be working with down the road... (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:44:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES And have you really look at what is it that I want to do, how will I use my interest in English, (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:44:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...what types of careers might go toward with that and then what potential major center colleges might I wanna go through down the road. 

00:44:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:44:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES How does that sound? 

00:44:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR It sounds good. And do you think I would be able to go to college? Do you think I'm like I can go, I'm a person who could be go in college? 

00:45:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Your GPA is what right now? 

00:45:05
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uhm, I'm not sure. I'll check it. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR I'll get back to. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES You've been getting most of the A's, B's, or C's? 

00:45:10
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  Sometimes I get A's but I have more B's and C's. 

00:45:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. You can definitely go to college. 

00:45:20
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:45:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES The issue is you're more likely to go if we give you the planning ahead of time. 

00:45:20
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  And you have the resources and know the courses you need uh, and where you need to go and... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR  Yeah(ph). 

00:45:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...how to pay for it. So you can absolutely. 

00:45:30
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR All right, cool. 

00:45:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Well, I'm really glad we have the chance to talk I enjoyed meeting with you.

00:45:35
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR I do. 

00:45:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, you may e-mail me anytime, any questions. I'm putting up a website uh, for the school counseling program and a list all the career and college readiness resources. (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Could you put me on a website? 

00:45:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES I'm sorry. 

00:45:45
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Could you put me on a website? 

00:45:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh, eventually, I love to get pictures if I have permission to put students in a website sure... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Cool. 

00:45:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...I think that's a great idea. 

00:45:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Cool. 

00:45:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. 

00:45:55
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Okay. 

00:45:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Thank you Suzette be (inaudible ) up. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
SUZETTE RAMSUNDAR Thank you. 

00:46:00
Vignette 2 Part B 

00:46:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Miss Ratti I'm really appreciative that you could join me and Mr. Houlihan I know you're incredibly busy, and it will just take a few minutes but I figured that we really should uh, attempt to do this up(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:46:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES As you know you hired me in as your new school counselor here in this high school and uh, I've met now with about half of the caseload uhm, about 125 of the 250 students that I've been assigned and I'm working with uh, the rising junior so they're all sophomores right now. And one of the things that I found I talked with Miss Ratti is that there hasn't been any career development that's been done with the elementary, middle or even high school there hasn't been any college readiness that's been done elementary, middle or high school, and uh, the students have heard of the SAT but they've not heard of the PSAT, and it's sophomore year they needed to be taking it very soon and I look at the data, I look at our gaps, things we're trying to close and I'm really interested in seeing if we might provide some sort of career and college readiness systematically for every student in the school as soon as possible. What do you think? 

00:47:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN  You're asking me what I think? 

00:47:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. Yeah. (clears throat) 

00:47:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN I, uh, I have attendance issues at the school. I have... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...behavioral issues at the school and you call me in here to talk with me about... (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah(ph). 

00:47:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN  college readiness stuff I'd, I'd. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:47:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:47:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN So, uhm, well, all right to be fair uhm, what, what, what's out there? I mean what's work? Because I, I, I've gotta worry about numbers... (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:47:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and, and things like that so. (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:47:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uhm, go ahead. 

00:47:40
REGINA RATTI  I've seen this done before in many of the schools that I've work then and it really has worked. And I think it will be extremely beneficial for the ninth graders now to start learning about what it's gonna take to better their education as far as their career fields and everything. I think it's something that will work. And I will volunteer to use this in my classroom for my students to start. 

00:48:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN But don't, aren't, aren't you teaching humanities? 

00:48:10
REGINA RATTI Yes, I am, and I will continue to teach humanities and it will be schedule that we can workout or something that will help the students. 

00:48:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, it sounds like your biggest underlying concern is how is this gonna help me out of data mess that I'm in right now. Is this gonna improve attendance, will there be better behavior, (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yeah, that's, (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...what's the bottom line? 

00:48:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...that's where I'm coming from. 

00:48:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So the evidence base is that we know that fully implemented school counseling program students are much more likely to attend school, behavioral problems, lesson uhm, and they get much more connected to their academics. 

00:48:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And that's my number one for this because in other schools that I've worked in I've seen this really work as well that, did the students get why they're here, what the point of a good education is, do they get the idea of the courses they're taking are not just to waste their time but we need to focus on what is it that you wanna do for your life, how is it that you're gonna be different you know five, ten years down the road, what kind of hopes and dreams do you have for your life, what kind of job do you want, what kind of career, and how the college or other post secondary things match with that. We can connect students better to what we're doing in school, and teachers that are highly motivated like Miss Ratti know that if you do career stuff you do college readiness the students get excited, they get inspired, they get empowered about wow, I'm not just sitting here doing all this tests or all these papers this is now gonna move me toward to what I wanna do with my life. 

00:49:35
REGINA RATTI Uh hmm. 

00:49:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES The bottom line is we need to show (clears throat) results from what we do. 

00:49:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yeah, and I need to. (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so, go ahead. 

00:49:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN I, I need to see results of where it's but, been done before... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right, exactly, exactly. 

00:49:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...in some other schools. 

00:49:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Right. So, I have, I can take you to the center for school counseling outcome research website, it's online the, the research studies are there, I have them as well. But I think the bottom line for us is to we need to create baseline data. 

00:50:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:50:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And we needed, to be able to look at once we start to do this lessons uh, we need to be able to show here's what students are learning, but learning isn't enough, how are they different, if we see referrals for behavior go down, if we uh, see attendance go up we can argue in part that doing the career and college readiness is assisted with that but we're not gonna know unless we try. So, that's what I'm asking is... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:50:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...if we can pilot this, and I'd like to pilot with the ninth graders. You have all the ninth graders... (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
REGINA RATTI Yes. 

00:50:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...between your English and your Spanish classes. 

00:50:30
REGINA RATTI Uh hmm. 

00:50:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES And so our thought was and our greatest dropout rates are biggest issue are the ninth graders. If we could start with them immediately see how that goes and we'll start to build with the other students and then there are some other activities we could do either assemblies or schoolwide uhm, I was the one who bring up on the website a number of specific areas uh, college board website, the NACAC website for college readiness, you know a couple of free career development programs that are at there as well. 

00:50:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES So we can start all the students and parents, and guardians, the nannies as well. So at this point there's no cost other than maintaining a little bit of extra stuff on the website uh, and we have a motivated teacher who's all for it, a motivated school, school counselor who wants to be tenured... (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
REGINA RATTI Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...but also wants to see a start to close the gap through the work that we do. 

00:51:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. If I see, if I can see some members of where it's been done before and it's been done successfully, and it's also affected attendance rates... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and lowered some discipline referrals and, and behavioral issues... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

00:51:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...then, then I, I, I'm open to it. 

00:51:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:51:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES I can show you specifics of students having done well in school academically in fully implemented school counseling programs. I'm not sure I can come up with specific data points for those areas yet but I can show you what we have and then we could work toward in terms of what we're doing to show evidence related to that when I work. 

00:51:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. Let's start. 

00:51:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

00:51:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Let's start. 

00:51:55
REGINA RATTI Great. 

00:51:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES All right. Okay. So, you and I will set some time in terms of... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
REGINA RATTI Yes. 

00:51:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...how and where we wanna go. We'll keep you fully informed. (clears throat) Show you the lesson plans, have you come in as she watch in terms of what's going on. 

00:52:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Yeah. 

00:52:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES And I know you've got a busy and other things to do so... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05

00:53:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] Thank you for coming. Uhm, [non-English narration] you calls me uhm, because you were having some concerns so I'll just like to know you know, what's going on. 

00:53:10
  [non-English narration]. (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
  [non-English narration]. 

00:53:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. So, he's, so I think what you're saying then is that he's been in Span, in Spanish class, only Spanish class for four years? 

00:53:35
 Yeah. 

00:53:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  And he seems to be bored and you really would like to see him you know, learn more English and be in English classes. 

00:53:45
 Si. 

00:53:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Uhm, [non-English narration] 

00:53:50
LEONARDO LOPEZ Leo. 

00:53:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Leo. Leo [non-English narration]? 

00:53:50
LEONARDO LOPEZ  [non-English narration] 

00:53:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uh hmm, and so you're doing the same thing [non-English narration]? 

00:54:10
LEONARDO LOPEZ Yup. 

00:54:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Wow, so how was that affecting you? 

00:54:10
LEONARDO LOPEZ  Well, uhm, well, as I said I'm getting bored and I, I, I really don't wanna come back to school because that's the only thing I'm learning and I wanna learn some English so I can talk... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:25
LEONARDO LOPEZ ...with other people. 

00:54:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So, I, and I see you know a little bit of English. Now, how do I learn that English? 

00:54:30
LEONARDO LOPEZ Well, some of my friends have been teaching me. 

00:54:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
LEONARDO LOPEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:54:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Hmm, so it seems [non-English narration] (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
  Si. Si. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:50
  [non-English narration] 

00:54:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:54:55
 I don't wanna ever see that, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Si, and that is a very real concern because in order to go to college, you really do need to have that English. It also be really good to, for you to continue that Spanish. So, I'm wondering if you've heard about uhm, if you've heard about dual language classes? [non-English narration] 

00:55:15
 No. 

00:55:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, Leo had you heard about dual language classes? Do you know any... (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
LEONARDO LOPEZ No. 

00:55:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...of your friends who were in dual language classes? 

00:55:20
LEONARDO LOPEZ No. (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  No. 

00:55:25
LEONARDO LOPEZ Not much. 

00:55:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Let me tell you a little bit about it. Dual language is when you'll have 50 percent of the class done in English and 50 percent in Spanish. Uhm, oh, I've seen you smiling already. (laughs) You know, would you be interested in that? 

00:55:40
 Si. 

00:55:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah? 

00:55:40
 Si. 

00:55:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] 

00:55:40
LEONARDO LOPEZ Uh hmm(ph). 

00:55:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah. I think that would work out very nicely for you. Uhm, I also have another idea. Uhm, have you heard AP's Spanish classes? 

00:55:50
LEONARDO LOPEZ No. 

00:55:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, okay. AP Spanish classes is, is what, uh, Advance Placement Spanish classes and it's classes that you can take now. You're in the fifth grade now, right? 

00:56:00
LEONARDO LOPEZ Yes. 

00:56:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. You can take these classes now from the fifth grade on and you can take college credits for it. Because, then you're gonna be learning Spanish, you know, really advance Spanish and then by the time you graduate, you can have college credits. So, how does that sound to you? (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
 Wow. 

00:56:20
LEONARDO LOPEZ Good. 

00:56:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah, are you planning to go to College? 

00:56:20
LEONARDO LOPEZ Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Yeah? Well, what are you thinking of? What would you like to study? 

00:56:25
LEONARDO LOPEZ  I am not really sure. 

00:56:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. So, it's not something that you've really wondering(ph). But that's something else we'll talk about to and maybe even in the Spanish classes as well as the English classes. So uhm, Señora uhm, [non-English narration] 

00:56:45

00:57:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Sure. 

00:57:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL a concern. Uhm, and I like to know you know, I like to get your opinion about something and your, your views 'coz you are the principal. Uhm, I've been talk, I've spoken to uhm, parents of a children in the Spanish classes. (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  And uhm, some of them and the children themselves have been telling me that they're, been in Spanish classes for a long time. One of them that I just saw has been in the Spanish class for four years and he says he's bored 'coz he really wants to learn English. And I was just wondering if you knew anything about this? No? It's the first time? (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN No, no, yeah, no this is the first time. I'm, (crosstalk) 

00:58:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh. 

00:58:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN I'm intrigued though. Tell me a little bit more. 

00:58:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Well, would, uhm, has happened is it seems like they've only uhm, in the Spanish classes and the kids are feeling isolated, they say that they wanna get to know the other kids in the school. They also said they're feeling bored and you know, they don't want to go to school. And actually I started looking at the data... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...for those classes and I saw that there are a lot of absences. 

00:59:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yes. 

00:59:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

00:59:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN There are, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:59:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN  I, that's, uh, uh, overall and you... (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh-huh. 

00:59:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...probably noticed Ketrin is that... (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN ... my concern has a lot to do with you know, attendance... (crosstalk) 

00:59:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

00:59:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and those numbers and stuff like that, so. 

00:59:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uh hmm. And that's one of the reasons I thought would be really important to bring it up to you. 

00:59:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:59:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, and it was not even the, uh, also in addition to the attendance, there have been a lot of disciplinary referrals... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yes. 

00:59:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...uhm, from those classes. 

00:59:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

00:59:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And so, uhm, I was wondering if uhm, there is any ideas of you know, how you might want to address it? I have some ideas but I thought(ph), you know, I'd first like to know what you were thinking about? 

00:59:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN Well, being that, you know, I wasn't even aware of, of, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN uh, what was going on initially. Uhm, I'd like to hear some of your ideas first. 

00:59:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh, okay. Uhm, well, one of the ideas I had was uhm, to bring, put many of these children in the dual classes 'coz we do have a dual language. You know, both Spanish and English. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:00:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And it seems like these kids and as well as the parents are just very eager to be put in those classes. 

01:00:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:00:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So, perhaps that might be a first step uhm, in addressing this issue. 

01:00:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN And do you, do you think that, with that if, if there are eagerness to attend those classes is there, you think it's possible that we'll see a rise in, in some of the uh, attendance numbers? 

01:00:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL I certainly think so. I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Okay. 

01:00:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL that's my hypothesis right now. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay, alright. 

01:00:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL But when I think what I would like to do also is actually collectative(ph) for you. Because I think that would be really good for you to have so that you know how this intervention is affecting the students. 

01:00:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right, 'coz uhm, it's all about numbers. 

01:00:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, yes it is. I'm very aware, aware of that. 

01:00:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:00:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, and the other thing that I've, and there's a lot of research based evidence on this and this is how I'd like to propose to you. There is also AP classes offered uhm, that I've read about and I'm familiar about. AP classes offered in grammar schools for uhm, in Spanish... (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN  Hmm. 

01:01:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...for the kids. And what's great about this is that the kids retained their native language. 

01:01:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL They're also learning English. They don't feel stupid you know, like when they begin to learn another language, they begin a little stupid. But here, they feel like having(ph) know something, they're very motivated... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:01:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  they learn about college, (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL uhm, and you know, I just tell them like I told the little boy that I just saw is, "Hey, you're gonna get college credit." And he just have the smile on his face. And I thought it would be a really great way to keep you, you know, how the uhm, graduation rates for Latinos is very low. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:01:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  and I thought that this would be a good way not only to get them to make sure they graduate from grammar school... (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:01:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...but it'll motivate them to keep going throughout high school and then into college. 

01:01:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay, that sounds interesting. 

01:02:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. Okay, I'm so happy to hear that you're open to this. 

01:02:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Sure. 

01:02:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Who would, who do you think uhm, I would need to talk to in the school? I mean, I know you know, you first, but are there certain teachers that you think that would be important for me to contact? 

01:02:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Perhaps uh, I would say the, the first person to start with would be uh, Ms. Johnson, uh, one of the Spanish teachers. 

01:02:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. 

01:02:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh, and, and I would say you know, just be, this is the, the initial discussion about it so uh, (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN I don't want to, you know, put it out there as... (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...this is something that we're definitely going to do. 

01:02:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN You know, it's in its initial stages so why don't we just uhm, start with a conversation with, with Ms. Johnson and we'll take it from there. 

01:02:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay, so, I'll arrange to have that conversation with me and then after it's maybe uh, all three of us? 

01:02:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yeah, that would be great. And you said that uh, uh, as time goes on you'll be able to collect the data... (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes I will. (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and share that to me. 

01:02:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL What I would like to do is certainly collect the data of how the students are doing now in terms... (crosstalk) 

01:02:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:02:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...in, in the class and how they'll do once they are in the dual language and then eventually in the AP classes. And that will be I think were wonderful data for you to have to show uhm, uhm, in the Board of Education and perhaps maybe then we could have more programs like this in the district. 

01:03:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. That sounds good to me. (crosstalk) 

01:03:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. Thank you so much for your time. 

01:03:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Sure. 

01:03:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL I appreciate it. (crosstalk) 

01:03:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Thank you, thank you.

The second half of the scene will be a discussion with the high school principal uh, and with the teacher advocating for uh, creating uh, high level curriculum college readiness courses for all students in the school. 

01:04:05

01:04:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:04:45
LOURDES RIVERA And I understand that are there no AP classes here. And prior to coming here, Diana was in AP courses and she was doing extremely well and I'm very... (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
LOURDES RIVERA ...concerned about this lack of resources... (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
LOURDES RIVERA  because my daughter is going to be going to college. (crosstalk) 

01:05:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm.

LOURDES RIVERA But I feel that she needs the preparation now. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
LOURDES RIVERA And the fact that there are no AP courses is a great concern to me. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So, you're here because you're really frustrated because you thought that the school would have the same opportunities for your daughter that your other one did and it turns out in this case that it doesn't. 

01:05:15
LOURDES RIVERA  Exactly. 

01:05:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:05:20
LOURDES RIVERA And I'd like to know what can be done about this. 

01:05:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, absolutely. Okay, uhm, uh, Diana can you share with me the courses that you took in AP at your last high school? 

01:05:30

01:05:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
DIANA CERONE Right(ph). 

01:05:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES And, and are you bilingual? Are you fluent in both Spanish and English? 

01:05:45
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

01:05:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. So another option might be AP Spanish at some point as long(ph) too, huh? (crosstalk) 

01:05:50
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

01:05:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, alright. So, it sounds like you all didn't know when you came into the school that there weren't any options for AP classes. 

01:05:55
LOURDES RIVERA No, we did not. 

01:05:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh, they have some honor's courses. Are you currently enrolled I think if I look that in your in some of the honor's classes that we had put you in or no? 

01:06:05
DIANA CERONE Uh, no. 

01:06:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES No, right. (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
DIANA CERONE (inaudible ). 

01:06:09
STUART CHEN-HAYES  So, that's one of the things that we could look at right away is honors are not necessarily an equivalent to AP but it's at least some advance curriculum as opposed to not(ph). So, let's do that uh, as one right away too. Uhm, your goal, your hopes and your dreams for your daughters are what? 

01:06:25
LOURDES RIVERA Well, I expect both of them to go to college and I... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30

LOURDES RIVERA ...if they don't get those type of rigorous... (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
LOURDES RIVERA  courses now in order... (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:06:45
LOURDES RIVERA ...to prepare them adequately... (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:06:45
LOURDES RIVERA ...from being able to get... (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:06:45
LOURDES RIVERA ...into the best college as possible. (crosstalk) 

01:06:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Absolutely. And I'm pretty new to the school too, so I'm aware and I'm in agreement with you that I think it's my role at this point to really advocate for AP classes. What would that sound like if I share with you that I will immediately meet with the principal and one of the teachers that I'm very allied with and see if we can really get this to move. I can't guarantee a time frame... (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
LOURDES RIVERA Uh hmm. 

01:07:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...but uh, I'm in agreement if it for my daughters I want that too. 

01:07:15
LOURDES RIVERA I'm sure you would. 

01:07:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:15
LOURDES RIVERA And I, and I'd like you know that you know, I am de, definitely not going to back off from this point so I appreciate your being on board with advocating... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
LOURDES RIVERA ...for this. But if I need to... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
LOURDES RIVERA ...speak to the principal as well... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
LOURDES RIVERA ...then I will do so. 

01:07:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Let me start, let's see what I can do, if you're not satisfied with I may, or even if you are, I mean, you, you feel free you can contact the principal at anytime too. 

01:07:35
LOURDES RIVERA Okay. 

01:07:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Before we do that I wanna find out, what would you like to be when you grow up and if you've thought about it where might you like to go to college Diana? 

01:07:45
DIANA CERONE Uhm, I would like to go for medicine and... (crosstalk) 

01:07:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:07:50
DIANA CERONE ...I don't know, probably out of state. 

01:07:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:50
DIANA CERONE Uhm, my mom really... (crosstalk) 

01:07:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:55
DIANA CERONE ...well, she would like me to stay here with her but I would really like to travel... (crosstalk) 

01:07:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:07:55
DIANA CERONE ...at this point. 

01:07:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Excellent, excellent. So that gives me an idea too. Do you all know about the International Baccalaureate? 

01:08:00
DIANA CERONE  No. 

01:08:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Do you heard anything about IB? IB, I wouldn't call it an equivalent to AP but it has some very similar connections... (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

01:08:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and especially for students who are bilingual, bicultural. 

01:08:15
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

01:08:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uhm, it can be a real advantage. International Baccalaureate is a worldwide curriculum and it's now offered elementary, middle and high school. And the most important years are the last two years of the high school program where you can uh, earn a diploma and basically that diploma is as rigorous as any other type... (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
LOURDES RIVERA Hmm. 

01:08:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...of curriculum anywhere in the world. So, it's somewhat different, it's inquiry-based as opposed to AP. AP you take... (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
LOURDES RIVERA Uh-huh. 

01:08:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...a certain number of classes. IB, you structure an entire curriculum and we have uhm, thousands of programs now doing IB around the world, there are number in the U.S., they're very few in this particular metro area and so personal interest of mine is to see if we might also include IB in addition to AP. And you can uh, Google uh, just the letters IB 'coz International Baccalaureate is very long, uhm, and I can give you that information to look at that too, but I think with the combination of honor's courses, a combination of AP and/or IB courses it gives you multiple high level curricula options to choose from. And you're absolutely right. The students that have access to those courses are the ones that have the widest range of options for career in college. Nora how about you? When you grow up what are your dream or what you like to be and how you get there? 

01:09:30
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN I would like to be when I grow up a teacher. 

01:09:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES You like to be a teacher? A teacher of what? 

01:09:35
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN A teacher of students. 

01:09:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. And what kinds of things did you teach your students? 

01:09:40
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN Math. 

01:09:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Math. 

01:09:40
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN  Reading and writing. 

01:09:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Reading and writing, excellent. And would you teach them in English, Spanish or both? 

01:09:50
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN Both. 

01:09:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Cool. 'Coz one of the things that we now is person's who have two or more languages have much more access to the job market and a lot more benefits in terms of going off to college too, excellent. Alright, well, I've heard you loud and clear and I want you to know I have a five and a half year old son and I want him to have access to AP courses and/or IB, when he's in high school honor's things too. And if it's good enough for my son, it's good enough for your daughters too. 

01:10:15
LOURDES RIVERA Thank you. 

01:10:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright, thank you. 

01:10:20
Vignette 4 Part B 

01:10:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  So, Mr. Houlihan uh, as the principal of the school I've called you in to this meeting because I had this parents uh, Ms. Rivera who came in with her children, the one who's just enrolled in the school as a transfer uh, sophomore student. And Ms. Bouknight uh, I ask you to come in as well... (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:10:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...as the lead teacher in the school uh, because there is a major issue brewing(ph) with this family and it's very clear to me that... (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES  we are gonna need to do something quickly. Uhm, this student uh, who's a sophomore is interested, uh, she wants to be a doctor. 

01:10:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES And uh, her name is Diana. 

01:11:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES And in talking with her she is in no honor's courses, she's just taking kind a regular classes whatever. 

01:11:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:11:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES And the mom said that they transferred from uh, a high school that had all sorts of AP courses and the daughter was taking AP History, AP English, very open to taking AP Spanish, the family is bilingual by culture. And uh, the mom said that she uh, is quite concerned and I said, "Well, you know, I think you're right, I'd be happy to advocate for us having more high level courses starting AP... (crosstalk) 

01:11:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:11:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...or," I introduce the concept of International Baccalaureate and I talk about my son. 

01:11:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:11:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uhm, and that he's now on an IB school and he's five years old. So my son has this why not this particular woman's kids and all of our kids. And so uh, I agreed that I'd advocate on her behalf, 'coz it was very clear that she will be talking to you regardless uh, and I thought well let me at least share with that. (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Sure. Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, we have no advance uh, we, we have uh, honor's courses but her daughters not in them... (crosstalk) 

01:12:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and we don't have AP or IB and this parent is wanting to insure that happens as soon as possible. 

01:12:10
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Well, there's a couple of issues I think. Uh, like if I, it's okay for me to speak about uh, (crosstalk) 

01:12:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN Of course. 

01:12:10
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT  Advance Placement classes or IB classes. Uhm, the focus has been put on uhm, insuring that our students are prepared to take the standardized test. And uhm, that's really where the focus of, of the teacher has been making sure our students are ready to take those test and also so they can uh, go on and take their ACT's. Uhm, and also we actually don't really have the time to uh, to devout to going to the trainings for the Advance Placement classes and it, it just be a lot upon the teachers to actually uh, assume that you know, they'll be, we'll all be ready or prepared to uhm, offer Advance Placement classes. It's a lot of structuring as far as the teaching schedules and, and what types of students will be in this classes is just a lot of questions uh, that a lot of the teachers would have. And uhm, it will just be difficult to incorporate that uh, Advance Placement or even IB courses within our current curriculum as it is right now. 

01:13:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. So, you see a lot of difficulties in it, one of which would be the time and effort in terms of doing the switch but it sounds like you are committed to the students doing well on their ACT's. Is that correct? 

01:13:25
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, well, (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:13:25
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT we believe that if we give them the proper instruction and the core(ph) courses that they will be able to use those skills to do well in those task, yes. 

01:13:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:13:35
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:13:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, one of the issues is that we all share that goal, we all want our students to do well but... (crosstalk) 

01:13:40
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...when we look at our test scores in the data in the school, even though that's what we say and that's what we're attempting to do, it's clearly not enough because less than 50 percent of our students are even attempting to apply to... (crosstalk) 

01:13:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:13:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...two year or four years institutions of college. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:13:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh, we have no doubt at showing whose graduating, whose getting diplomas. We have the sizable numbers of students who are dropping out. When we desegregated that and we look at out English language learners or students with disabilities, our African-American Latino students are not doing as well as our dominant culture students in this group. So, I think we share what you said but I think this parent is saying what we also know is that we need to make a stronger curriculum, we need to be offering multiple different path so that people have more choices and see that if we can get multiple data points up so that we indeed do have all of our students taking the ACT, going off to college and being successful. What do you think, Mr. Principal? (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Well, one of the, one of the things that I keep peering(ph) at the district level is that we are one of the few schools that do not have... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

01:14:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...AP classes. And while I do here your concerns... (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:14:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and, and do understand that there is a certain amount of training that goes involved with, with teachers having to present the AP courses. Uh, I'm, I'm in line with, with Mr. Chen-Hayes here in terms of, uh, we're not talking about revamping... (crosstalk) 

01:15:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Correct. 

01:15:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...the, the entire curriculum, we're talking what my understanding is and what I would like to see done is an introduction to a handful of AP courses initially. (crosstalk) 

01:15:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh, and incidentally the training for AP courses can take place over the summers. 

01:15:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN And we do have a certain amount of money alloted... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...in the budget... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN  for... (crosstalk) 

01:15:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:15:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...those sorts of training. So, (crosstalk) 

01:15:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN  I understand, you know, (crosstalk) 

01:15:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:15:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN that summers are important and as you know, part of my contract I had to give up a certain part of the summer uh, (crosstalk) 

01:15:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

01:15:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN so in order to bring the school along to where it needs to be, maybe there's a piece, (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN uh, a handful of teachers that will be willing to go for that training... (crosstalk) 

01:15:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...and we can start offering some AP courses. 

01:15:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:15:50
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Okay, well, maybe we can work uhm, on something, maybe do, uhm, do a volunteer basis because, (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Right, let's look at... (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:15:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...much teachers will be interested... (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and I think... (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

01:16:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...uh, I think for all of us it's always better when we get people who are interested and volunteer than we all, all had enough with certain mandates. So uh, (crosstalk) 

01:16:05
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh-huh. 

01:16:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES it's great. The other piece is I'd be happy to volunteer to get a group of folks together to, at, uh, doing something around IB and maybe starting, since we have academies in our school maybe starting an IB academy. Which again we take a, a small cohort of teachers uh, we have a number of Spanish speaking students in the school and families. 

01:16:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:16:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES And the neat thing with IB is it's all bilingual. And so if we could get a cohort that is bilingual in Spanish and English we have very easy and effective way to do that. And again the opportunities that are open, not all of our students are gonna stay here in the U.S. with a large population of students from Mexico and from the Caribbean, from South America. (crosstalk) 

01:16:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:16:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Students may end up going to college or for secondary outside the U.S. (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm, that's true. 

01:16:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES And an IB diploma gives that in ways that, that AP does not. So, if that's alright with you, I'd like to maybe see if we could start that, that way we're beginning to offer multiple high level uh, pieces, but it's going back exactly what you said uh, Ms. Bouknight that we want all students to be doing well on their exams and reaching their career in college, yes. So, thank you for taking the time, I appreciate it. (crosstalk) 

01:17:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN Absolutely. Thank you. (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Okay. Thank you. 

01:17:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm.

Culturally Competent Counseling and Coordination For Equity and Access Vignette 5 Using the ACCESS Questionnaire to Assess Multicultural and Social Justice Climate 

01:17:15
DERYL BAILEY  The name of this vignette is Using the ACCESS Questionnaire to Assess Multicultural and Social Justice Climate of the school.

01:17:40
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

01:17:40
DERYL BAILEY It is, it is Diana, right? (crosstalk) 

01:17:40
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

01:17:40
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Uhm, these are gonna, actually a few questions uhm, easy(ph) questions that is to get your perspective in terms of uhm, what the, the social, uh, the climate of the school is in regards to different groups of student. Uhm, when I say different groups of students I refer African-American, with Latinos, Latinos/Latinas uhm, but this from your perspective uhm, how is the school counseling program of the school addressing issues that maybe of concern to those particular groups of student? 

01:18:10
DIANA CERONE Uhm, as far as the Hispanic population I don't think they're addressing the Hispanic population as much as they should. 

01:18:20
DERYL BAILEY Uh-huh. 

01:18:20
DIANA CERONE From my perspective. 

01:18:20
DERYL BAILEY Okay. What is some things that you think would, would, would benefit Latino students at the school if, if they were sort of built into the school, the school climate or the activities of, of the counseling department, with administration or whatever(ph)? 

01:18:35
DIANA CERONE We'll get even(ph) more involved. What happen is a lot of them don't speak you know, uhm, English very well and so... (crosstalk) 

01:18:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:40
DIANA CERONE ...they get left you know, left down of any program that is in the school. And is because it's an English of course, but I think that they should be included. 

01:18:45
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:45
DIANA CERONE  Uhm, there should at least have somebody speaks Spanish that go guide us, uh, the students... (crosstalk) 

01:18:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

01:18:50
DIANA CERONE  in allowing to come, be part of uh, the other affluents(ph) are in it. 

01:18:55
DERYL BAILEY Okay. So, do you think if, if there were more, more maybe teachers or, uhm, faculty at the school who uh, were probably(ph) could speak Spanish, uh, would you think that would be beneficial to the student population? (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
DIANA CERONE Oh, yes, definitely. Uh hmm. 

01:19:10
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Are there any, are there any activities here at the school that we, that we do now that are beneficial to those students who uhm, may not be as proficient in English? 

01:19:20
DIANA CERONE Uhm, to benefit the Spanish population as you mean? (crosstalk) 

01:19:25
DERYL BAILEY Yes. 

01:19:25
DIANA CERONE Uhm, I think if there were more programs as far as, well, definitely the classes they were you, you know, they will need to have more Spanish speaking professors, teachers but as far as programs uhm, I don't do more activities with the students. 

01:19:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:19:40
DIANA CERONE  You know, after school activities I would say definitely. 

01:19:45
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Uhm, in terms of the students who may have some, may have different learn, learning styles, learning disabilities uh, do you, do you feel there is, there is services or activities building to the school climate? The sort of help those students to belong in and fit in? 

01:20:05
DIANA CERONE Uhm, for what I understand, I know they're, they get special attention from the, from the department but I'm not sure, I'm not really familiar with what they get or not. 

01:20:15
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Okay, but do you, and you mention uhm, early with you know, the Latino students who uhm, may not speak proficient uhm, English, that there was some activities, some af, after school tutoring sessions uhm, that teachers could, uhm, could be involved in to help those students. Uhm, what about students who uhm, maybe uh, questing(ph) their sexuality or gay, les, maybe gay or lesbian. Are there uh, things that we, that, that we do here at the school could do to also help those students feel more inclusive and, and belong a part of the school? 

01:20:50
DIANA CERONE Uh, groups? 

01:20:55
DERYL BAILEY Groups. (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
DIANA CERONE Uh, yeah, I have groups friend, yeah, for them.

Do you, do you see that(ph) in groups with, with a culmination of those students who maybe giving those, providing those students an opportunity to learn from one another and support one another? 

01:21:30
DIANA CERONE Oh, definitely, that would help as well. (crosstalk) 

01:21:30

01:22:35

01:24:05
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. But it's definitely not the climate that we wanted to create your in, in, in the school uhm, to have you had an opportunity to talk to your teachers about you know, ways that you know, would, things that they could do to help you.

But you know, since I told them that I wasn't planning on not going to college, they're becoming a little bit more supportive so(ph). 

01:25:15

DERYL BAILEY Right. 

01:26:40
TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...you know, who's taking care of my child.

01:27:05
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:27:05
Vignette 6 Part B 

01:27:05
DERYL BAILEY  Mr. Houlihan I appre, I appreciate you meeting with me. Uh, I just one meet, with one, one of our young ladies whose uhm, were about teen uhm, preg, parents and uh, she talked about needing more support from us to help her finish, finish school and going to college. 'Coz I want to have an opportunity to sort of brings to her some ideas and, and sort of share some thoughts that I've been having to how we might help students because we, we've, we got quite a, a number of them that maybe having some of the same challenges uhm, that uh, to me she was. Uhm, so one of the things I was thinking about is maybe if we could create some supporting the work for the students who are teen parents uhm, one of the things that Tamisha talked about was possibly uhm, after school tutoring but also have some babysitting services available if possible uhm, to, to support her in her efforts to, to uhm, finish school and, and, and do well. So, in it, what are your thoughts about that? 

01:28:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN In terms of the after-school services? (crosstalk) 

01:28:05
DERYL BAILEY Yes. 

01:28:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uhm, I believe in, in tutoring one uh, of the areas that we can start with uh, we have a national honor society... (crosstalk) 

01:28:15
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...program at the school and uhm, I think it's been done before uh, (crosstalk) 

01:28:20
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN we could probably bring it back where seniors uh, and I think a handful of juniors... (crosstalk) 

01:28:25
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...uhm, as part of the requirement for being a member of the National Art Society... (crosstalk) 

01:28:30
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

01:28:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...dedicate I think it's Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays... (crosstalk) 

01:28:35
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...uh, some tutoring services. It'll be at the end of the school day until about 3:30 or quarter to four. I think that that would probably be a good place... (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:45
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...to start with that in terms of the tutoring. I'm not a hundred percent sure about the, the babysitting services... (crosstalk) 

01:28:50
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:28:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...but I, it's, it's something that uh, we could definitely look into uhm, you know. And I, I would also ask you maybe to take a lead on that. 

01:29:00
DERYL BAILEY Well, one of the things that I was thinking that we have the uhm, uhm, childhood development uhm, course here. 

01:29:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh hmm. 

01:29:05
DERYL BAILEY And some of their resources they offer aft, you know, after-school, uhm, they've been doing some projects after-school. 

01:29:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Oh, okay. 

01:29:15
DERYL BAILEY And so maybe you know, if we get a teacher to work with some of maybe the oldest students in that class to provide, uhm, to provide some you know, some type of services for some of the young ladies if we decided to, to do some... (crosstalk) 

01:29:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. 

01:29:25
DERYL BAILEY ...after-school tutoring for those girls on, on specifically. 

01:29:30
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:29:30
DERYL BAILEY That was one idea that we've made, that I would like to pursue with your permission to, (crosstalk) 

01:29:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Sure, absolutely. 

01:29:35
DERYL BAILEY to approach the teacher. 

01:29:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:29:35
DERYL BAILEY  Uh, well, now, now the other pieces, the larger pieces of problem... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN Great(ph). 

01:29:40
DERYL BAILEY ...because that's kind of after the fact but uhm, the curriculum, I want to talk to you about it(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yeah, yeah, 'coz that's the, that's the big picture. (crosstalk) 

01:29:50
DERYL BAILEY Right, exactly. So, uhm, I'm not quite, quite sure ab, about how the school board or you know, would, would see us (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:30:01
TERENCE HOULIHAN In terms of the uh, approaching it from a sexuality education? (crosstalk) 

01:30:05
DERYL BAILEY Yes. Uh hmm. 

01:30:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh, I, I know that in New York State uh, we do have, we have the legal right as a school... (crosstalk) 

01:30:15
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

01:30:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...to, to go about it in terms of a comprehensive sex, you know, sexuality education program. And there are some schools that do the, the absentness(ph) only. 

01:30:25
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uh, but I'm, I'm aware that the numbers don't necessarily support absentness(ph) only so uh, the numbers do support comprehensive. (crosstalk) 

01:30:35
DERYL BAILEY Comprehensive, exactly. 

01:30:35
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uhm, I am very much open to you know, being progressive... (crosstalk) 

01:30:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...as a school building leader so, I think implementing a comprehensive sexuality education program would be good. We can introduce it obviously in the health classes. 

01:30:50
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

01:30:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN And I think that if we uh, use SIECUS, are you familiar with SIECUS? 

01:30:55
DERYL BAILEY Not a, the whole lot. But can you tell me more about what this is? (crosstalk) 

01:31:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. It's the, uh, it's an acronym I believe it, it stands for Sexuality Information and Educational Council of the United States. 

01:31:05
DERYL BAILEY Right. 

01:31:05
TERENCE HOULIHAN The great, it's, it's a great program uh, that's why I got you know, a lot of ideas in terms of how to approaches from... (crosstalk) 

01:31:10
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:31:10
TERENCE HOULIHAN  comprehensive background. I think that would an awesome... (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

01:31:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN ...place to start. 

01:31:15
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

01:31:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Uhm, if, just jumping back a little bit, you were talking about the supporting that works, have you, and I know it's, it's a scheduling you know nightmare. (crosstalk) 

01:31:25
DERYL BAILEY Nightmare. 

01:31:25
TERENCE HOULIHAN And, and I'm not talking about scheduling it during the day but there, there are some pregnant teens in the building, have you thought about maybe approaching it from a, a, a group counseling perspectives? (crosstalk) 

01:31:35
DERYL BAILEY Yes, I, and Tamisha and I talked about that and she said she would be willing to be one of the participants of uh, identifying those young ladies. And what I want to do is meet with them one on one to sort of explain what the goals of the project would be and the group would be. (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

01:31:50
TERENCE HOULIHAN And to sort, cre, create that, that uhm, that type of uh, network and even maybe doing uhm, uh, meeting to them lunchtime sort of like a brown bag lunch to sort of offer support to one another. (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
TERENCE HOULIHAN Yeah, that's fine, okay. 

01:32:00
DERYL BAILEY And she was, she was really uhm, willing and interested in doing that so, uhm, well we appreciate you're support uh, the students are important to us because you know, we want almost all of our students to, to be successful and uhm, Tamisha's really focused and wants to finish high school and going to college and wants the same for her kid. 

01:32:15
TERENCE HOULIHAN Right. Well, if, if it's, it's, it's a number's game, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:32:20
DERYL BAILEY Yes. 

01:32:20
TERENCE HOULIHAN And if, if this is going to keep students, not only in school, but if it's gonna help them to graduate and, and you know, move on with their lives uh, college career and stuff like that I'm, I'm open to it. (crosstalk) 

01:32:35
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. Get busy on starting with the groups for, for these young ladies uhm, during lunchtime. 

01:32:40
TERENCE HOULIHAN Okay. 

01:32:40
DERYL BAILEY Uhm, and uhm, look and check into the other curriculum that you talked about. 

01:32:40

Equity-Focused School Counseling: Ensuring Career And College Readiness for Every Student Disc 2 Knowledge and Use of Technology For Equity and Access Vignette 7 Creating an ACCESS Plan for Every Student with Technology 

01:32:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES  This vignette is entitled Creating an ACCESS Plan for Every Student using Technology. I am working as a high school counselor and I have two uh, ninth grades students here who are just starting their career college uh, readiness journey uh, with our school and what we'll see in this videotape is an illustration on how school counselors can challenge the digital divide. Neither student has internet or computer access at home or elsewhere and so we are gonna create their ACCESS plan in person in my office uh, and I will use my laptop. Hello, Bix and Nina welcome to the school counseling departments uh, (crosstalk) 

01:33:50
BIX WINDBIEL Okay(ph). 

01:33:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Hmm(ph). 

01:33:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES at our high school, we're glad to have you both here and do you know why you're here today? 

01:33:55
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, well, uh, you know, we had to write some stuff up and we don't have computers so. 

01:34:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ So, we're in your office. 

01:34:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Exactly. So, we figured that I uh, I now have this online on our uh, school counseling program website and since you're not able to access it and you're two the last folks to get it done, I figured that we do it in person, alright? So, I will then transfer the results from the site and we can go from there. And I appreciate you all coming into today uh, and uh, I look forward to again this is password protected so once I have it up on the site only you have access to it. But obviously since you don't have computers, we're working on building our career college readiness lab here once we have the laptops up and ready to go then you'll be able come in and access it in any point in time. But this is something that I use annually, I work with you and I updated each year as we go through testing idea where you at coming at a high school and then each year as you go through sophomore, the beginning of junior, beginning of senior year as well too, okay? Alright, so let's start. (crosstalk) 

01:34:55
BIX WINDBIEL Okay. 

01:34:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES What I've done is I have taken, we have a national school counseling program model that's based on what we called uh, National School Counseling Standards. They're in academic, career in college and personal social areas and so I have a series of nine questions, actually I've 12 questions that I'll ask and just give me you know, your initial response once I entered in, you can always go and then change it, add to things like that, but our goal is to learn about your hopes and dreams for career in college and hope you'll be successful graduate your high school and go off and do what you need to do. Okay? 

01:35:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

01:35:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright, so the first question is what are your goals for academic success this year as a ninth grade students and what can we do to help you reach them in the school counseling program? So, who ever wants to begin? 

01:35:40
BIX WINDBIEL Go ahead. 

01:35:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, so you mean grade wise or? (crosstalk) 

01:35:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Could be grades, could be it's personal uh, purposely up and ended so(ph). 

01:35:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:35:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:35:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I would like to get 90 or above averages so that way colleges will uh, think about accepting me. But uhm, considering I don't have a laptop or computer at home it's hard to write up papers for English or uhm, History so with your program I can use them. 

01:36:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so it will help you. Your goals is to get at least 90, is to get As. Uh, what's your GPA coming in from ninth grade? 

01:36:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Uhm, I believe it's uh, 87 I think. 

01:36:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so, a, a, a high B, B plus? 

01:36:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:36:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, excellent. And so your feeling is that whatever we can do at the school to make computer labs or computer accessible for you would be a real help? 

01:36:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, definitely. (crosstalk) 

01:36:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, alright, excellent. Bix how about for you? If there's one academic goal that we could uh, more than one that we could assist you with the school counseling program gonna be successful, what would it be? 

01:36:40
BIX WINDBIEL Well, you know, uh, I've uh, uh, like Nina I wanna get high grades in all my school especially in the third marking period where the... (crosstalk) 

01:36:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:36:50
BIX WINDBIEL ...where it goes on our transcript. 

01:36:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:36:50
BIX WINDBIEL Uhm, but you know, not that I'm making periods(ph) between the hemiter(ph) and uh, this should help like uh, you know, I've been writing some papers that I would've preferred to have typed. 

01:37:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:37:00
BIX WINDBIEL And that's been a little bit of a problem, (crosstalk) 

01:37:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:37:05
BIX WINDBIEL you know(ph). 

01:37:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES So then if we can get you a regular computer access, enter a time to use school computers because at this point there's not a guarantee that you all be having computers (inaudible ), okay? And then, uhm, are there been any things in terms of academics that haven't work for either of you in the past that you would wanna do differently or that we could help you with like things that you tried that didn't work be it study wise or trying to get up your averages into the 90s, what types of things have you tried before that hasn't work? 

01:37:35
BIX WINDBIEL Well, I've never been very good at like managing my time, you know, like... (crosstalk) 

01:37:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:37:40
BIX WINDBIEL ...for like uh, you know getting stuff done one time, it's never been my strong point (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:37:46
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I, I thought same problem as Bix. (crosstalk) 

01:37:46
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:37:46
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, and I think also when I do get my hands on the computer whether it be my library or friends house, I usually tend to uhm, instead of doing schoolwork I'll go on uhm, website for games or something and not really focused on what I should be doing. 

01:38:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so time management and ... (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm(ph). 

01:38:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...procrastination... (crosstalk) 

01:38:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. (laughs) 

01:38:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and uh, the few times that you do get on the computer 'coz you don't normally get the chance to do that at home It's like, "Hey, this is great. I wanna fun" (crosstalk) 

01:38:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:38:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES So part of it is that if we can set up maybe regular times for you... (crosstalk) 

01:38:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:38:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...or regular access to begin to look around if we can find uh, a library within any(ph) traveling distance or an internet cafe or something that will allow to have that access. and then, uhm, uh, one of the things that we wanna do in the school counseling program is to give regular time management and anti-procrastination workshops and strategies in classrooms so that's something that I write then in terms of all trying to get to us (inaudible ). Okay, uhm, do you know the exact number of credits and courses that you need to graduate from high school in order to get into uh, well, graduate first, but in order to get into college or from(ph) secondary ahead. 

01:38:50
BIX WINDBIEL  I don't know. I'm not sure. (crosstalk) 

01:38:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah(ph). 

01:38:55
BIX WINDBIEL But I know that I have to complete certain number of classes in each semester and stuff but... (crosstalk) 

01:39:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:39:00
BIX WINDBIEL ...and uh, do community service but... (crosstalk) 

01:39:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:39:05
BIX WINDBIEL ...I don't know the exact. (crosstalk) 

01:39:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES You don't know the exact number, uh-huh. 

01:39:05
BIX WINDBIEL She does(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:39:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Yeah. 

01:39:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ We went over it in my school but I don't really remember what they said. (crosstalk) 

01:39:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES I remember right, so we need to make sure that you all clear on that and part of that well be as well uhm, help me get an idea are you all looking at doing college after graduation and if so, what kind? 

01:39:20
BIX WINDBIEL Uhm, yeah I wanna go to college. 

01:39:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:39:25
BIX WINDBIEL Maybe not necessarily the first year after college but I wanna take it, I mean after high school. I wanna take a year off or something but you know, I definitely do wanna go to a college. (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:39:35
BIX WINDBIEL I don't know what kind, I'm not sure. 

01:39:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, alright. Nina, how about you? (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, I am definitely wanna go to college after... (crosstalk) 

01:39:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:39:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  graduation... (crosstalk) 

01:39:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:39:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...and I'm hoping for Ivy League, I know it's a stretch but I do wanna go. (crosstalk) 

01:39:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Well, it's uh, there's nothing wrong with hoping and part of what, my role is then is to work with you all to look at what we talk about best fit. What's the best place for you to go and it's important for you to aim for those that, that maybe we call rich schools that maybe a challenge or the most so, uh, highly selective and then look at some of the selective ones and some not so selective ones so that you have a range uh, and that'll be important to talk about. So, it sounds like what we can do here is make sure that you are clear on the exact credits that you need for graduation and then the specific courses that you will need uh, to be successful in terms of uh, the college choices that you wish to make. And that's part of what's important in terms of career in college readiness from school counselors is making sure that you take advance level coursework, that you should take some coursework maybe even college little courses(ph) before you graduate which can lessen the cause and also sort of things that we can do. Alright, that's very helpful. Let's now shift over to career development. If you had it narrow down to only three when you grow up or at least past(ph) high school what would be your three top career choices? Uh, if you had to pick them up. 

01:41:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

01:41:00
BIX WINDBIEL  Uhm, well, (crosstalk) 

01:41:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, Bix. 

01:41:05
BIX WINDBIEL uh, the first would be uh, some kind of writing like journalism... (crosstalk) 

01:41:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh-huh. 

01:41:10
BIX WINDBIEL ...or something like that and then uh, architecture and like design was interesting(ph) to me too. 

01:41:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:41:15
BIX WINDBIEL  Those are the two big ones like (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:41:23
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So writing related maybe journalism, architecture design and there are multiple pass(ph) within that. 

01:41:25
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, I mean, of course, like you know, I wish I can be a rock star but it's you know. 

01:41:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Oh, you can always add rock star too, absolutely. Some, someone's gotta become a rock star. (laughs) Alright, so let's take a minute with you and talk about if uh, writing related or journalism and architecture design and become a rock star are your choices. (crosstalk) 

01:41:45
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah(ph). 

01:41:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES What are the courses that you're gonna need in high school that will be most successful it gets you, getting you toward anyone of those three? 

01:41:50
BIX WINDBIEL Well, uh, obviously writing for journalism and writing... (crosstalk) 

01:41:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:41:55
BIX WINDBIEL ...and all that it's obvious. (crosstalk) 

01:41:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:42:00
BIX WINDBIEL And like a drafting technical drawing when I heard about for uh, architecture... (crosstalk) 

01:42:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:42:05
BIX WINDBIEL ...design. 

01:42:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, and what else for architectural design besides uh, drafting and, and (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:42:12
BIX WINDBIEL I'm sure Math would be very important. 

01:42:12
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, and would this be Math A and B? Would this be Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Precal, Calculus? (crosstalk) 

01:42:20
BIX WINDBIEL Mostly Geometry and Trigonometry those kinds of things. 

01:42:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Yeah, at least, but the more that you can... (crosstalk) 

01:42:25
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

01:42:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...take advance Math courses, the more likely in terms of the architecture set of things, schools are extremely competitive, the more that you have advance Math courses, you'll be up there with other candidates coming in and attempting to do that. To be a rock star what are you gonna need? 

01:42:40
BIX WINDBIEL Well, I'm a singer. So, (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Cool. 

01:42:45
BIX WINDBIEL voice lessons. (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Some chorus or voice absolutely... (crosstalk) 

01:42:45
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, sure. 

01:42:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...it's very important. What else? (crosstalk) 

01:42:50
BIX WINDBIEL And uh, I don't know uhm, songwriting, you know, composition, music theory... (crosstalk) 

01:42:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:42:55
BIX WINDBIEL ...those kinds of things. 

01:42:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES And a lot of that are more likely in college. (crosstalk) 

01:42:55
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

01:42:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  What would you need in high school prior to? 

01:43:00
BIX WINDBIEL Good grades to get into a college. 

01:43:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. 

01:43:05
BIX WINDBIEL I'm sure exactly. (crosstalk) 

01:43:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES But there are rock stars who don't go to college. But let say that you're a rock star who chooses to go to college. Uh, you likely if you're successful make a lot of money, correct? And so rock stars need to have good business sense or they need to have goods revision management skills, the folks to hire to be around them to schedule them in, to monitor their bank accounts, concerts(ph) so some supervisor or business or management skills and, and Math is important too. Yeah. 

01:43:30
BIX WINDBIEL  Alright. 

01:43:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so that covers all of that. Let's go across Nina, for you what are your three top career choices? 

01:43:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, I'd say my three top career choices are uh, being a, a psychologist. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:43:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:43:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ a teacher and maybe an actress. 

01:43:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. And so, uhm, teaching to become a psychologist or uh, to become an actress. What are the courses that you would need uh, in high school to be successful on your way toward college for those three? 

01:44:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Well, uhm, it depends what kind of teacher I wanna be. I think I'd rather be a teacher for elementary grade so I'd have to get a basic understanding of, of my courses in high school so Math, English, Science and History. (crosstalk) 

01:44:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES You need, you need to be good in everything? 

01:44:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Yeah. 

01:44:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, so that will help, but if you had to specialize what, as an elementary school student you need to cover the whole curriculum. But even so, there might be areas that you're more interested than others or? 

01:44:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, more Humanities... (crosstalk) 

01:44:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:44:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...than Math and Science. 

01:44:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. Although, I'm gonna give you a tip that often if you're strong in Math and Science, principals will be even more excited. 

01:44:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Oh. 

01:44:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES 'Coz there's a real need in the schools for well-trained Math and Science teachers... (crosstalk) 

01:44:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

01:44:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...especially at the elementary level. So, keep with the love of Humanities but think at the back of my mind what else might I do with Math and Science to really set myself apart from other candidates who are equally strong in Humanities? 

01:45:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

01:45:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES So that's just kind of a, and knowing that your cue(ph) is fairly high that's a good thing to do. Right, how about uh, to become a psychologist? What are the particular courses that would be useful and important in high school? 

01:45:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Uhm, I'm not really sure. 

01:45:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Uh, Humanities, Social Science, Math, Regular Science, you have to be a really good communicator in both written... (crosstalk) 

01:45:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

01:45:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...as well as oral. 

01:45:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, I think that's a big part of it to(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:45:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Yeah, yeah. And uh, the, the acting interest... (crosstalk) 

01:45:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

01:45:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...can be very useful if you're in drama or do public speaking, speech scene... (crosstalk) 

01:45:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Speech, yeah. 

01:45:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...the day(ph) theme because those activity show a real interest in people, they show a real interest in communication and psychologist have the experts of both people and communication... (crosstalk) 

01:45:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

01:45:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...and how to study the science of both. Cool. And then, the acting component you don't necessarily have to go to college for but lots of actors do go and go study in the School of Drama... (crosstalk) 

01:45:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:45:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...or something like that. So, alright. Cool. Is this helpful to you two at this point going through and, (crosstalk) 

01:46:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, definitely. (crosstalk) 

01:46:00
BIX WINDBIEL Uh hmm. 

01:46:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES and kind of see in here? Alright, if it's not let me know. (crosstalk) 

01:46:05
BIX WINDBIEL It's a lot more clear. 

01:46:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, you know what course is to take. (crosstalk) 

01:46:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Now, all about clarity in making that match which we know all of the above. Okay, let's go back to you, Bix, uhm, if you had to pick your top three interests or skills in anything, everything, everywhere what would they be? 

01:46:20
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, writing. 

01:46:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. 

01:46:25
BIX WINDBIEL Uhm, singing and music in general, uh, and, uh, those are the two big ones but also baseball. 

01:46:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES And baseball, too. Alright. Do you ever thought about attempting to play, uh, semi-pro or professionally? 

01:46:45
BIX WINDBIEL I'm not good enough. 

01:46:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright. Okay. So, it is fun. It's, it's, (crosstalk) 

01:46:45
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

01:46:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES it's a hobby. Okay. Alright. So, those skillls which you say they match your career choices or at least two of the three? 

01:46:55
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, yeah. 

01:46:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. Alright. One of the things we know about people being happy and successful in their careers long-term is that they pick, uh, careers that skills and interests match or that people who are in those careers have those skills as well. So, it's important, do you know any rockstars? 

01:47:10
BIX WINDBIEL Hmm, no, not really. (crosstalk) 

01:47:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Do you, I mean, in person, do you now any architects or designers? 

01:47:15
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, yes, I do. 

01:47:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. And so, one of the things might be to hang out with them, talk about what their interests are, how they got into architecture design things like that and only(ph) journalists or professional writers? 

01:47:25
BIX WINDBIEL I do. 

01:47:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. 

01:47:25
BIX WINDBIEL  Yeah. 

01:47:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. Alright. I have a background in journalism and professional writing so, consist a little with that before I became a school counselor. Ah, and so, it's important to find folks and, and check out with them, things they like about their careers and things they don't but the skills and their activities, their hobbies often will tell us a great deal about how they have it and make a good connection in that. Nina, how about for you? What are your three top skills or activities? 

01:47:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, I would say, uh, track, running and...(crosstalk) 

01:47:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:47:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...uhm, theatre... (crosstalk) 

01:47:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:47:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...and circus... (crosstalk) 

01:47:55
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. 

01:48:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...are the big things. 

01:48:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Alright, and do you see connections between those three in the career possibilities that you have as a teacher psychologist and an actress? 

01:48:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Well, the theatre and, uhm, circus definitely relate to... (crosstalk) 

01:48:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:48:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...acting. 

01:48:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. 

01:48:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I'd say that's a bit, well, and like theatre kind of help so with teaching in psychology 'coz it helps you learn to communicate with other people... (crosstalk) 

01:48:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:48:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...which definitely. (crosstalk) 

01:48:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES To convey messages. 

01:48:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right, yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:48:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah? Excellent. Okay, alright. And track and field keeps you, keeps you vibrant and healthy. 

01:48:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:48:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Very important in all of the above anyway you have to stay fit actually for all three career so. (crosstalk) 

01:48:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

01:48:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright. So, good connections there. Do you know any professional actresses? 

01:48:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yes, I do. 

01:48:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, and I assume you know teachers. 

01:48:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

01:48:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES And do you know any psychologists? 

01:48:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, yeah, I do. (crosstalk) 

01:48:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay, so again, the same thing as I said with Bix that you wanna really try to meet the folks, get some idea, what do you like about your career, what are the things you don't, what are your interests and activities and see what kind of fit there is with that. Okay, the last one in terms of career development, uh, and you may, uh, actually have kind of, uh, talked about this already but I'm looking for your favorite hobbies or activities outside of school and what those top three would be. So, Bix, do you wanna start again? 

01:49:20
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, yeah, uhm, definitely playing baseball and, you know, I do that, you know, as long as it's in season. 

01:49:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:49:25
BIX WINDBIEL Uhm, uh, doing, uh, theatre, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:49:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:49:30
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, acting is a lot of fun... (crosstalk) 

01:49:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:49:30
BIX WINDBIEL ...and, uh, (crosstalk) 

01:49:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:49:30
BIX WINDBIEL  listening to music, listening... (crosstalk) 

01:49:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:49:35
BIX WINDBIEL ...to a lot of music. One of my... (crosstalk) 

01:49:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. 

01:49:35
BIX WINDBIEL ...top three. 

01:49:35
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent, alright. And now, in high school as well, it's important to find activities that you can put that in so that as you move toward college you can show a progression about here are my hobbies, my activities, these are the things I'm interested in and to show for college admissions officers, uh, you may take a leadersip role in certain activities about things that you were doing that will really show here's my passion, here's my interest as you move toward college you'll gonna be writing admission essays. Why the school wants you to be, uh, why you wanna be at the school and why they should select you. So, talking about activities and hobbies, if there's a link, that can really help. Okay, how about for you Nina? 

01:50:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, outside the school I like, uhm, acting and taking voice lessons and, uhm, taking trapeze classes. 

01:50:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Awesome. So, you're a trapeze artist (laugh) which means you're well-balanced. Wow. There are a lot of folks who would not touch that with 10-foot pole. How do you maintain your balance literally doing something like that? 

01:50:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, well, it takes a lot of focus and you kinda have to put fear aside for a little bit and just go for it. 

01:50:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Wow, amazing. That's something you definitely wanna talk about in the college admissions essay 'coz it really sets you apart and shows your uniqueness and for both of you, that's part of our work as school counselors to help draw out what are the things that are unique about you as you go to pursue your career in college dreams. Cool. Alright. Let's do, uh, a few, uh, questions on your, uh, college readiness and getting ready for post-secondary and, uhm, you both talked about what you wanna do. You both wanna go to college, uh, so, actually, I'll skip over them. What additional information do you or your family members need about how to get into college or the process of, of getting admitted? 

01:51:15
BIX WINDBIEL  Well, I don't really know much about the college, uh, process at all... (crosstalk) 

01:51:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm. 

01:51:25
BIX WINDBIEL ...like the high school application process was pretty intensed in the city... (crosstalk) 

01:51:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:51:25
BIX WINDBIEL ...but, uh, for college, uh, I really don't, I'm not sure like... (crosstalk) 

01:51:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:51:30
BIX WINDBIEL ...where do I want to apply whatever(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:51:30
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. So, where to go, how to apply, financial aid, paying for college, making the decisions, filling out the applications, doing the essays, making sure that you get in courses that match high-level curriculum, honors courses, events placement, international baccalaureate, and your heads(ph) to be swimming but those are the types of things that's why we're doing this is to find out who has information, who doesn't and these are things that the school counseling in college who are in this program will give you as you go through and we'll do it for parents and guardians as well. Are you first generation? Did one or both parents or guardians go to college in your family or? 

01:52:10
BIX WINDBIEL They both went. 

01:52:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. 

01:52:10
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

01:52:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright. Alright. 'Coz we do even more for folks who haven't had a parent or guardian who have gone through. 

01:52:15
BIX WINDBIEL Okay. 

01:52:15
STUART CHEN-HAYES And if you want to be a student athlete in college, you said that you're not gonna be pro but if you like one after baseball scholarship or something following the NCAA regulations are real importance as well too. (crosstalk) 

01:52:25
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, I will start to play in college. 

01:52:25
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, well then, that's something to consider as well simply really highlight and look at, uhm, if, if going to the scouting process if scouts are interested in you that can be a way to get a full free ride or full scholarship to college, too(ph). 

01:52:40
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:52:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES So, cool. Alright, Nina, how about for you? 

01:52:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, I just, I, I was looking and there are just so many colleges out there and I don't really know which one is the best one for me. It's just out of all of them. 

01:52:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Okay. So, a big part of our work will be connecting you to resources that can assist you in the college search process. Uhm, we'll be bringing you to our websites related to the college board. We have a really amazing program called Naviance which actually helps in the whole career development and sight selection or in case you go through the college selection process and there are other ones as well, too. How about for you? Are you first generation? Do you have family members who have gone to college before? 

01:53:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I have had family members who have gone to college. 

01:53:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES Alright. Okay. So, again that can be a help in the process but we'll give you the full, uh, set of things as we go through and that's really important. Alright, uhm, as you look at the courses that we offer here at the school, we offer regular courses, we offer, uh, honors courses, we offer advance placement courses and we'ere talking about starting an international baccalaureate program. As you look at your interests and your hopes and your dreams, uhm, what do you know so far about the different types of rigorous course work, the different types of courses that you could be in and, and tell me what you know. 

01:53:55
BIX WINDBIEL  Well, I, I think that's probably important to be in those courses and I'm sure that will impress colleges... (crosstalk) 

01:54:00
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Yeah. 

01:54:05
BIX WINDBIEL ...quite a bit, you know. 

01:54:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah. 

01:54:05
BIX WINDBIEL So, obviously, more than regular courses if you're in one of those three. 

01:54:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES Yeah, so, (crosstalk) 

01:54:10
BIX WINDBIEL Uhm, so. 

01:54:10
STUART CHEN-HAYES it sounds like you'd be interested to make sure that we have you in honors under AP under IB courses as much as we can. Uhm, are you fluent in languages other than English? 

01:54:20
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, I'm not quite, I'm not fluent but I, I've studied German. 

01:54:20
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Okay. So, uhm, some of the IB programs, uhm, will offer dual language fluency and so that might be something that, to consider and then there are AP courses that you can take. You can get stronger off in German that you can place out for college credit with that as well. So, now, that's... (crosstalk) 

01:54:40
BIX WINDBIEL Uh hmm. 

01:54:40
STUART CHEN-HAYES ...really gonna work. Okay, Nina, how about for you? 

01:54:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, as you said, to be a teacher you wanna stand out in Math or Science so, I think that I do wanna stand out and I can do that by taking AP courses or... (crosstalk) 

01:54:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:54:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...honors. 

01:54:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES  Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. Absolutely. So, it's important that we make sure that you get programmed into the courses that really move with that and not only for graduation but that for both of you multiple years of advance Math, multiple years of advance Science, really strong literacy courses and an elective should really go toward, you know, your interest, both you have interests in the arts. Ah, and so, those are really important to you that you get to take some side courses, that you get to take some design courses will really help with that so that your time in high school really matches your hopes and dreams for the future and then she could really begin to see the connection and make that happen. Okay. Uhm, I think we'll leave it at that, I have some other personal social questions I know that our time is coming to a close for today, how this has been for both of you talk to me what it's been like? 

01:55:40
BIX WINDBIEL Ah, it's, it's been good you mean stuff like clearer, like, you know, me, less like tangle, you know, (crosstalk) 

01:55:45
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:55:45
BIX WINDBIEL either bunch of confusion about all those subjects and just an... (crosstalk) 

01:55:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:55:50
BIX WINDBIEL ...absolute easier... (crosstalk) 

01:55:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:55:50
BIX WINDBIEL ...uh, to sort things out. 

01:55:50
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. Alright, Nina how about for you? 

01:55:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah, for me I was just, sort of, been putting off college and I'll figure it all go but now it actually hit me that I'm going to go and you actually made it clear to look at my intrust and see how it'll connect... (crosstalk) 

01:56:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:56:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ ...to a jobs I wanna pursue. (crosstalk) 

01:56:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Uh hmm. 

01:56:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ So, it was very helpful. 

01:56:05
STUART CHEN-HAYES Excellent. Alright. So, I'll make sure that this added in online and then you'll eventually have a password protected code to be able to get in. You can shift this anytime you want 'coz we don't especially know your major, know what you're gonna be, you know, right away but we want you to be thinking about that and beginning to get some ideas about, no upon intended, but where's the best ballpark, uh, in terms of where you wanna be. And so, now, what you'll be getting from the school counseling program is that we'll be doing regular lessons in classrooms on career and college readiness, academic developments and personal social things, we'll be doing some group counseling things, we always have individual counseling available, and then we're doing, doing the planning on an annual basis. We'll be doing a career college nights for you and for parents and guardians as well to get information out, uh, and that's what really about as being resources, uhm, our goal so that you can meet your dreams. Okay. So, I wish you a good rest today and we'll see you soon. Take care. (crosstalk) 

01:57:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

01:57:00
BIX WINDBIEL Thank you.

01:57:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  The title for this vignette is Connecting 9th Grade Students to Post-Secondary Options: Utilizing College Board Materials. Uhm, in this vignette, a 9th grader comes to see me because she's confused about her career and we explore a little bit about what her confusion is about. After which, we'll stop the tape and then I'm going to be working with two teachers in developing lessons to address the ca, career concerns of not just one student but of many of the 9th grade students. 

01:57:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Hi, what's your name?

01:59:55
DIANA CERONE Exactly. 

01:59:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...they haven't done that. 

01:59:55

02:00:15
DIANA CERONE Uhm, it's exciting but I was, sometimes is a little bit scary, uhm, (crosstalk) 

02:00:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:00:20
DIANA CERONE I don't know if I'm gonna be able to go to college, (crosstalk) 

02:00:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:00:25
DIANA CERONE I mean, my parents really want me to stay in the restaurant and help 'em out. 

02:00:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:00:25
DIANA CERONE  Uhm, so, I, I don't know. I really like to go to college but I'm, I'm a little confused. 

02:00:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Okay. So, and when you say you wanna go to college then what is it that you dream of doing? 

02:00:35
DIANA CERONE  Uhm, either become a pediatrician, or... (crosstalk) 

02:00:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:00:40
DIANA CERONE ...a nurse. That's something... (crosstalk) 

02:00:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:00:40
DIANA CERONE ...I wanna do. 

02:00:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Ah, okay. So, you wanna go, be able to go to medical school, to nursing shool. 

02:00:45
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:00:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Okay. How are you doing in school? 

02:00:50
DIANA CERONE I'm being good. I can ace, ace some base, you know. (crosstalk) 

02:00:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, won, wonderful. 

02:00:55
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:00:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So, what do you think, what courses do you think you need to take in order for you to be able to go to college and go to nursing or? 

02:01:00
DIANA CERONE Ah, mostly biology, math, (crosstalk) 

02:01:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:01:05
DIANA CERONE Uhm, English, unique good, you know, good communication. 

02:01:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:01:05
DIANA CERONE  And, uhm, things related to health. So, I will say health, the health class to delve(ph). 

02:01:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. So, it seems like you've ha, you have some ideas of what it is that you like and what it is that you might want to do. 

02:01:20
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:01:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. Uhm, uh, I also, I think what I hear you saying is that you're not set on it, those are some ideas but that you would like to know a little bit more. 

02:01:30
DIANA CERONE Yes, definitely. (crosstalk) 

02:01:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. Have you heard of, uhm, myroad.com, it's a website on, uhm, on the computer? 

02:01:40
DIANA CERONE No and... (crosstalk) 

02:01:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:01:40
DIANA CERONE ...I don't have a computer at home. 

02:01:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay, so, you don't have a computer at home. Okay, do you know that we have a computer lab here at school? 

02:01:45
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

02:01:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. So, uhm, I was thinking that that might be something that you might be able to log on to. I'm working now in the school to see if we can get it for all the students. Right now, you might have to get your own subscription to it... (crosstalk) 

02:02:05
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:02:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...but it's not too expensive and I'm gonna try to see if I could do something so that we can gather some money in the school. I think it's maybe around $16 right now individually... (crosstalk) 

02:02:15
DIANA CERONE Okay. 

02:02:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...but I'm gonna move towards, you know, talking to the principal and other people to see if we can get it for the entire school. And in that website, it'll really help you get to know yourself a little bit better. Ah, they have some inventories that you can do and then there's also the types of careers, what you will need to do in order to get into... (crosstalk) 

02:02:35
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:02:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...those careers. Would you be interested on that? 

02:02:35
DIANA CERONE Yeah, definitely. And I think... (crosstalk) 

02:02:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:02:35
DIANA CERONE ...my friends will be interested in that too. 

02:02:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay, what makes you say that? 

02:02:40
DIANA CERONE Well, a lot of my friends are also thinking of going to colle, uhm, to college and especially my, uh, best friend, (crosstalk) 

02:02:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:02:45
DIANA CERONE would like to go to the same one. We're... (crosstalk) 

02:02:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:02:50
DIANA CERONE ...really close. 

02:02:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. Are you in the same classes together? 

02:02:50
DIANA CERONE Ah, one. 

02:02:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. (crosstalk) 

02:02:55
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:02:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. Uhm, now, I've, I'm not sure but I think as I was looking to your records, you're also in the English as the second language course? 

02:03:05
DIANA CERONE Yes. 

02:03:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. 

02:03:05
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:03:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. So, I think maybe what I'll do is I'm going to, given that you said that there is some friends of yours that are interested also maybe we'll talk to some of your teachers and maybe we can do some lessons so that you can explore your career with your friends. 

02:03:20
DIANA CERONE That'll be great. (crosstalk) 

02:03:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. And then, you could, you know, help each other out and give each other ideas and support each other as you're going through school. 

02:03:25
DIANA CERONE  Okay. 

02:03:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, okay. Uhm, there's also some materials in Spanish and maybe that might be really helpful for your parents to know, you know, a little bit about the careers here and also, uhm, you know, what would, what they would need to do in order to help you for college, uhm, if in fact that's what they, you know, you all decide. And we can talk more about that, uh, because maybe you, I could offer something in Spanish for the parents to, sort of, they have them understand what it might be like to go to college here in this country and how it might help our families 'coz as you know, (crosstalk) 

02:04:05
DIANA CERONE Uh hmm. 

02:04:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL I mean, you know, as a Latina myself it's so important to be able to help about your family. And maybe you'd be really nice to, you know, you can work in the restaurant as your parents say but also then make your parents really proud by other things that you can do perhaps by going to the nursing school. So, we could work on that too. 

02:04:25
DIANA CERONE Yeah, that will really help me. 

02:04:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay. So, uhm, thank you, thank you for coming and I'll be in touch with you again. 

02:04:35
DIANA CERONE Thank you. 

02:04:35
Vignette 8 Part B 

02:04:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Thank you so much for coming in. Uhm, uh, the reason I ask both of you here 'coz I know Tamisha that you teaches Technology and... (crosstalk) 

02:04:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:04:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...uhm, Laurie that you teach English as the second language. And I wanted to run an idea pass to you and see what you think. 

02:04:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Okay. 

02:04:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uhm, there had been, uhm, a couple of students in the 9th grade who have been really interested, uhm, some of the Latina and Latino students who have been really interested in knowing more about careers and they've been coming to see me individually and, uhm, you know, we've been working on some things individually. Uhm, they don't have computers at home and there's a lot of... (crosstalk) 

02:05:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uh hmm. 

02:05:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...information available in careers, uhm, on the computer particularly from the college work. So, here's my idea and see what you think. My idea was perhaps maybe we could have, you know, we could put our heads together and maybe how a couple of lessons that we can do perhaps in English and in Spanish and using the computer and the materials on the computer is available both in English and Spanish also. 

02:05:45
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Okay. 

02:05:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And, uhm, we could help the 9th graders begin to think more about their careers and who, who they are, what their interest are, and what they may wanna do. (crosstalk) 

02:05:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uhm, uhm, that sounds really interesting. Uhm, I always thought that career should be more focused towards the upper grades like the 11th and 12 graders... (crosstalk) 

02:06:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:06:05
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...but I mean that's how I guess our curriculums have always been but... (crosstalk) 

02:06:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

02:06:10
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...I guess incorporating that with the early years that sounds like, that sounds like a good idea. 

02:06:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, so from, from your perspective and the way things have been done... (crosstalk) 

02:06:20
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:06:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...is usually been the focus on the 11th and 12th grader. So, (crosstalk) 

02:06:20
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, that's the length. 

02:06:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL you're, sort of, like, "Oh, why do it in the 9th grade?" 

02:06:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, it's still, (crosstalk) 

02:06:25
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Yeah. 

02:06:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT it's a little surprising but... (crosstalk) 

02:06:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uh hmm. 

02:06:30
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...you know, I'm not, I can't speak for Laurie but I know for me. (crosstalk) 

02:06:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:06:30
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT So, it's a little surprising to do it with the 9th graders and, uh, I'm not quite sure why we would but, you know, (crosstalk) 

02:06:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:06:35
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT but I think that's, it should be a good idea I think everyone should have... (crosstalk) 

02:06:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:06:40
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...uhm, equal information. So. (crosstalk) 

02:06:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. So, you're not quite sure why we do it but it sounds like a good idea. 

02:06:45
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) 

02:06:45
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:06:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah, and actually in my experience too and even when I went to school it wasn't damn that early. 

02:06:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:06:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And I don't know what your experience was like. 

02:06:55
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Well, I guess my concern is that, do you think that, that students are really able to determine what they wanna do with that age? I feel like a, sort of, young, I feel that already coming out of school the're very confused. 

02:07:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:07:05
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uhm, do you think that they know at that age what they, is it too young for them? I guess that's my concern. 

02:07:10
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, that one. (crosstalk) 

02:07:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Actually, one of the things they found is that career development really starts in kindergarten because... (crosstalk) 

02:07:15
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:07:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...that's when, you know, if you think back at our own lives, that's when we begin to dream of... (crosstalk) 

02:07:20
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:07:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...what do we wanna do when we grow up and, you know, and that's when we can really tap into peoples excitement, kids excitement. And so, one of the things that, uhm, the researchers found is that the earlier we can tap children into what they want to do and begin to dream and tap into that and then what do they need to do in order to make their dreams a reality, the, the more, uhm, likely they would be to graduate from high school which is something that's so, of such importance to all of us... (crosstalk) 

02:07:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT  Uh hmm. 

02:07:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...and to be motivated and to actually, you know, uhm, work in their classes. So, that was another reason why I thought this might be a great idea because it might be really helpful for motivating the kids to, you know, do their work because there's a goal in the end. 

02:08:10
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:08:10
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:08:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:08:10
DR. LAURA ROBERTS And so, how would this work exactly? 

02:08:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, well, one of the things I was thinking about, I'm glad you ask that, uhm, here are some materials from the College Board and it's, uh, bilingual, it's an, for the 9th graders and... (crosstalk) 

02:08:25
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:08:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...it's called It's Up To Me. And... (crosstalk) 

02:08:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:08:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...if you look at it, it really explores uhm, you know, what the kids are thinking about in terms of who they are and then what do they want... (crosstalk) 

02:08:35
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:08:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...to do so that we can incorporate it into your class and... (crosstalk) 

02:08:40
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:08:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...they can have writing assignments, uhm, we could also incorporate to maybe, you know, uhm, Tamisha, we can do it, uhm, with the myroad.com, uhm, (crosstalk) 

02:08:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:08:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL and that's something I'm gonna wo, talk to the principal about and see if we can get, uhm, the school to buy into this. 

02:08:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:08:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL It's not that expensive and that way we can have, you know, we can do this as a pilot program. 

02:09:00
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Okay. (crosstalk) 

02:09:00
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:09:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uhm, and then, we can get together and, you know, it's the three of us putting our heads together. I don't have all the answers but I know that both of you are just wonderful teachers and really interested in your kids and I thought this might be some way to go. 

02:09:15
DR. LAURA ROBERTS I like the idea of incorporating, uh, into the actual class rather than adding something else because, and then... (crosstalk) 

02:09:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:09:20
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...it also gives the kids a purpose especially when it regards to writing, uhm, but I like the idea of, sort of, like I said incorporating it in the classroom. (crosstalk) 

02:09:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. So, for you to be so, uh, your idea is let's incorporate it into the class... (crosstalk) 

02:09:35
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Yeah. 

02:09:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...because then we can have those writing assignments. 

02:09:35
DR. LAURA ROBERTS I think so, yeah. (crosstalk) 

02:09:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, yeah. (crosstalk) 

02:09:40
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT And also making it relevant to what they wanna do in the future. It is not just... (crosstalk) 

02:09:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:09:45
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...uhm, you know, giving them an assignment that they have no attachment to but this is something nice actually intrinsically coming from them. So, (crosstalk) 

02:09:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:09:50
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:09:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT I think it'll be really good. 

02:09:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Wonderful. So, I'm, I'm really happy that both of you like this idea and I... (crosstalk) 

02:09:55
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:09:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...look forward to working with both of you and maybe we can plan a time that maybe next week we can get together and then we could, sort of, really, you know, uh, crystalize a little bit what we might want to do. 

02:10:05
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Well, thank you for sharing that. Ah, we have never thought of doing something like this. So, thank you. (crosstalk) 

02:10:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, thank you. 

02:10:10
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Thank you. 

02:10:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Thank you.

Leadership For Equity and Access Vignette 9 College and Career Readiness Begins in Kindergarten 

02:10:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  The title of this vignette is Career and College Readiness Begins in Kindergarten. In this vignette, the mother comes in with her daughter 'coz she wants her daughter to be in English only classes because she's concerned that her daughter will not be able to go to college or have a good career unless she's in English only classes. So, I take a leadership role as a school counselor and help her turn, to see that, in fact, being multilingual will allow her to have more options in terms of college as well as career. 

02:10:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  [non-English narration]. 

02:11:00
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

02:11:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. [non-English narration] 

02:11:00
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Nora. 

02:11:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Nora. Hi, Nora. How are you? 

02:11:10
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN [non-English narration] 

02:11:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. How old are you? 

02:11:15
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN [non-English narration]. 

02:11:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, you're seven years old, okay. So, you're a big girl. Uh-huh. So, uhm, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you to talk with me today? 

02:11:25
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uhm, [non-English narration]. 

02:11:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:11:30
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  [non-English narration] 

02:11:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Hmm, and, oh, so, what you're saying is that you would want, uh, Nora to be in English only classes because right now she's in, uhm, only Spanish classes and you don't want her to have any difficulties later on, uhm, like, it seems like for you in learning the language. 

02:12:05
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration] 

02:12:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL And you speak the language very well. How did you learn the language? 

02:12:10
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Ah, well, I come on to classes, (crosstalk) 

02:12:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:12:10
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  [non-English narration] 

02:12:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:12:15
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration] 

02:12:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Uh hmm, uh hmm. [non-English narration] 

02:12:25
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  [non-English narration] (crosstalk) 

02:12:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. [non-English narration] 

02:12:30
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  [non-English narration] 

02:12:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. So, she's doing very well in her Spanish classes and... (crosstalk) 

02:12:35
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration] 

02:12:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  I see you smiling Nora. Tell me, tell me about your Spanish classes. 

02:12:40
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN  [non-English narration] 

02:12:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] 

02:12:45
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN  [non-English narration] 

02:12:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  [non-English narration] Uh hmm. So, uhm, I hear your concern 'coz I think it is very, very important that the children be able to speak in English and you're absolutely right in order for their future. Uhm, what I'm not sure if you are aware of is that Nora will have more possibilities in terms of careers and in terms of job opportunities and even perhaps, even in colleges, uhm, by knowing two languages. We're you aware of that? 

02:13:25
DR. LOURDES RIVERA No. 

02:13:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  No. Yeah and I think that's something. I wasn't aware of it either when I was, I came here when I was very young and people were telling my parents that we, I had to speak only English and my parents then said to me, "Nope, you have to keep your Spanish language." And, unlike Nora, I complaint because I didn't want to study Spanish, uhm, but today I'm very grateful because they were very right and in fact they were, it was, it's very true I had many more opportunities for college as well as careers. Uhm, so one of the things that perhaps maybe we can talk about is perhaps maybe what might be helpful is for Nora to be taking classes in both languages, uhm, both in English and in Spanish. How would. (crosstalk) 

02:14:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration] (crosstalk) 

02:14:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:14:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  [non-English narration]. 

02:14:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] You know, and that's mean, uh, so I hear your concern that is she going to have a good education? It depends upon the bilingual education program 'coz sometimes it's not a quality program, however, here we do have a very good bilingual program and it's dual language where she can speak, she can retain the Spanish and develop that and also, uh, in, uhm, increase her ability to speak English. Uhm, and one of the nice things Nora for you is, uhm, do you have grandparents? Uh hmm. What language do they speak? 

02:15:05
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN  [non-English narration] 

02:15:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Oh, so they speak both English and Spanish. And when used to talk to abolita(ph)? Yeah. Do you talk to her in Spanish? 

02:15:15
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN [non-English narration] 

02:15:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] Well, yeah, [non-English narration]? What do you talk to her about? 

02:15:20
NORA RIVERA-LARKIN  [non-English narration] 

02:15:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  [non-English narration] You, you talked to her about how much you care about her and that's one of the things [non-English narration]. You know, we won't be able to have this relationship, she won't be able to talk to her grandmother the way she is now because she only be talking in English. So, not only is it so important for career and college readiness but for our families. You know, how important our families are for us. So, uhm, let's, uhm, I'm gonna talk to the principal and see if, uhm, we can get Nora enrolled in a dual language, uhm, and that will certainly be so helpful for her, uhm, in career and college as well as in our families. 

02:16:25

02:16:35
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration] 

02:16:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  So, so, it seems like it's, of you, would you have any concerns about it if we do go on that path? 

02:16:45
DR. LOURDES RIVERA No, [non-English narration] 

02:16:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL [non-English narration] There is a wonderful book that also that I like you to be aware of... (crosstalk) 

02:16:50
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uh hmm. 

02:16:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...and it, right now I only have it in English with me but it's also available in Spanish and it's called, If Your Lang, Your Child Learns in Two Languages. Uhm, and it's, they had, they have it in Spanish [non-English narration] and it will address a lot of the concerns that you have 'coz I think it's so important for us to know that the best thing for our kids is to be able to speak the both languages. 

02:17:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA [non-English narration]

02:20:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

02:20:50
DERYL BAILEY ...and they will go over that, your transcript to show you exactly what you've had and what you need, uhm, and just, sort of, keep, keep checking you that way and then during that advancement period you can, uhm, select the other electives that you like to take. 

02:21:05

02:21:30
[sil.] 

02:21:30
DERYL BAILEY  Okay, uhm, so, do you, do you have someone to standing now of what exactly the types of courses you need to graduate. 

02:21:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Right. 

02:21:40
DERYL BAILEY And the number of credits you need. 

02:21:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Yeah, I understand the credits and I have to complete them within my four years of high school. (crosstalk) 

02:21:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay, okay. Now, do you know the difference between AP course, IB courses, honors classes? 

02:21:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ No. 

02:21:55
DERYL BAILEY No, okay. Uhm, and, uhm, the AP and IB courses are your, your very rigorous courses. They are... (crosstalk) 

02:22:05
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

02:22:05
DERYL BAILEY ...that, sort of, continued, the, the, the, that college prep type classes. And, uh, do you plan to go to college? 

02:22:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yes. 

02:22:10
DERYL BAILEY Okay, good. So, then you want to enroll in some of the, uhm, AP courses. 

02:22:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:22:15
DERYL BAILEY And with the AP course is you actually there's a test at the end of the year. 

02:22:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uh hmm. 

02:22:20
DERYL BAILEY Okay. And based on your performance on the test you can potentially earn college credit, uhm, that will go towards your, your freshmen year, your first semester in college... (crosstalk) 

02:22:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:22:30
DERYL BAILEY ...if you scored at, uhm, a three, at least a three on the exam. The highest you can get is five, you score three, then you get, you get college credit. So, we need to start looking at which AP courses, uhm, we offer that you have, uh, available to you and which one should you be interested in taking. And then, IB courses are, are, are pretty much the same but IB, uhm, diploma is, is an international kind of, uhm, diploma program that you could, that you could look into. (crosstalk) 

02:22:55
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:22:55
DERYL BAILEY We might also need to considers for, foreign languages because all the colleges are requiring students to have some foreign language. (crosstalk) 

02:23:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Language, okay. 

02:23:05
DERYL BAILEY So, we need to look at, uhm, not only what you need for graduation but also what you need to graduate from high school versus what you need to be admitted into the colleges that you're looking at. (crosstalk) 

02:23:15
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. Okay. 

02:23:15
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Have you consider where you might wanna, want to apply? 

02:23:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Uhm, no, I have not really thought about it yet. 

02:23:20
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Well, uhm, but we're about at the end of our time for the day but the next time we meet let's start looking at places that you might, schools that you may wanna go... (crosstalk) 

02:23:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:23:30
DERYL BAILEY ...so that we can compare what they require for admission... (crosstalk) 

02:23:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:23:30
DERYL BAILEY ...versus what we require for graduation. 

02:23:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Okay. 

02:23:35
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

02:23:35
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Thank you.

DERYL BAILEY Uhm, according to the school records, you've missed quite a few number of days. Can you tell me what's, what's going on? 

02:24:15
BIX WINDBIEL Why should we come? Nobody else does. 

02:24:15
DERYL BAILEY Well, that's, that's not exactly true. Ah, let me ask you something. What, what do you, what, what do you plan on doing when you, when you're done with high school? What are your goals? What are your dreams? 

02:24:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Maybe college. 

02:24:25
DERYL BAILEY  Maybe college. Okay. What about you? 

02:24:30
BIX WINDBIEL I don't know, uhm, I guess something, you know, or. 

02:24:35
DERYL BAILEY Something like? Can you be more specific? 

02:24:35
BIX WINDBIEL  Okay, uh, well, I love our college 'coz at least, it's like big and more school. 

02:24:45
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

02:24:45
BIX WINDBIEL  You know, that... (crosstalk) 

02:24:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. 

02:24:50
BIX WINDBIEL ...I would want to go to. 

02:24:50
DERYL BAILEY Did you know there's other, all the options other than just four-year schools, there are two-year schools there, uhm, uhm, apprenticeships and those kind of the things, right? 

02:25:00
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

02:25:00
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Then you say, maybe some college Nina, uhm, any idea what, what you might wanna major in if you decided to go to college? 

02:25:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I don't know. 

02:25:10
DERYL BAILEY You're not sure? Okay. Uhm, you say some college, you, do you know you wanna do something beyond high school, okay. So, let's, let's immediatel, just ask you a few questions about graduating from high school. Is that a, is that a goal or an aspiration of yours, both from you? Nina? 

02:25:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  I guess, yeah. 

02:25:30
DERYL BAILEY You guess? 

02:25:30
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Yeah. 

02:25:30
DERYL BAILEY Bix, do you think that graduating from high school would be a good thing? 

02:25:35
BIX WINDBIEL I learned a lot more with my attendance rate. 

02:25:35
DERYL BAILEY Well, that's what we're gonna talk about. So, did you, but is, I'd, when I first determine if graduating from high school is important to you? 

02:25:45
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, I think it, (crosstalk) 

02:25:45
DERYL BAILEY Yeah? 

02:25:45
BIX WINDBIEL I think it is. 

02:25:45
DERYL BAILEY Okay, you think it is. Alright, so now, you, you asked about your attendance rate with the, with, with the graduation requirements. Uhm, you are aware that, you know, you have to, to come to school, to earn the credits in order to graduate, right? 

02:26:00
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

02:26:00
DERYL BAILEY Okay. And then you're, you're pretty much aware of that, too, right? Okay. Uhm, do you know how many credits you need to graduate? 

02:26:10
BIX WINDBIEL No, I have no idea. 

02:26:10
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Nina? You, you need exactly 24 credits to graduate. And so, each year you should be earning credits to were, to 24 to graduate but we also know that if you missed more than 10 days, you can be dropped from the school rolls which means you get no credit for that semester. Right? And we don't want that to happen, do we? 

02:26:30
BIX WINDBIEL  No. 

02:26:35
DERYL BAILEY Okay, because if you're not here then you can't reach that goal that you would like to, to reach which is graduating from high school. Okay. Bix tell me, what, what would you like to do when you're, in 10 years, what would you like to be doing? 

02:26:45
BIX WINDBIEL  I don't know. I like, I like riding, I like. (crosstalk) 

02:26:50
DERYL BAILEY You like riding? 

02:26:50
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

02:26:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. So, you like to, in a career, get a job when you're, you're riding? 

02:26:55
BIX WINDBIEL I guess so. 

02:26:55
DERYL BAILEY  Okay. And Nina, you? 

02:27:00
NINA GERSHONOWITZ Like maybe be an actress but I don't see the point of going to school 'coz I don't see how I need any of that stuff to be an actress. (crosstalk) 

02:27:05
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. Do you, do you know any actresses? 

02:27:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ No. 

02:27:10
DERYL BAILEY Who's your favorite actress? 

02:27:10
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  Uhm, Bernadette Peters. 

02:27:15
DERYL BAILEY Bernadette Peters. Do you know how she got to be such a good actress? 

02:27:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ No. 

02:27:20
DERYL BAILEY Okay. So, one of the things you might wanna do is, is look at Bernadette Pe, Peters and see how much education, what type of education she, she, she had to, to, sort of, get to where she is. Do you think that acting is just natural? Do you need to learn it? Can you learn it? That something that you need to work at? 

02:27:40
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I guess but I mean it's mainly natural. 

02:27:40
DERYL BAILEY  Uh hmm. 

02:27:45
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I don't see what school has to do with that. 

02:27:45
DERYL BAILEY Well, the, the school can provide you with some opportunities to learn more and become better at those things, for example, have you been in any of the school plays? 

02:27:50
NINA GERSHONOWITZ  No. 

02:27:55
DERYL BAILEY Okay. You might wanna talk to the drama teacher and see if you could be, you know, get in, involved in some of that because a lot of those students began, uhm, become involved in community theatre which leads to, can lead to acting roles, uhm, but being in school in, in learning, uhm, in learning how to do those things is important. Alright. Uhm, Bix can, can you tell me some things that might make school more interesting for you? 

02:28:20
BIX WINDBIEL Well, if they just did more what I enjoyed doing like there are some things that I find really boring. Ah, I don't see, I'm not be there for that. 

02:28:30
DERYL BAILEY What kinds of things that would, would you like to seemed do more of? 

02:28:35
BIX WINDBIEL Well, like I said I like riding, you know. (crosstalk) 

02:28:40
DERYL BAILEY Uh hmm. 

02:28:40
BIX WINDBIEL And sports, you know, sports are fine. 

02:28:40
DERYL BAILEY Okay, are you taking in in Journalism classes or work with the yearbook or the newspaper? 

02:28:45
BIX WINDBIEL No. 

02:28:45
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Would you consider that as a possibility? 

02:28:50
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, probably, that would be a good thing. (crosstalk) 

02:28:50
DERYL BAILEY Okay. But you know to be involved in those activity that your attendance at school has to be, uhm, a lot better than it is. 

02:29:00
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah. 

02:29:00
DERYL BAILEY Okay. So, if we talk to the, to the, uh, Journ, Journalism teacher and the yearbook adviser and they agreed to take you on, do you think that maybe mov, be, maybe more motivation to, uh, to come to school? 

02:29:10
BIX WINDBIEL Yeah, I think so if there's something interesting like that for me, you know. (crosstalk) 

02:29:15
DERYL BAILEY Okay. Alright. Nina, what, what would be more motivation for you to come to school? 

02:29:20
NINA GERSHONOWITZ If it started later. 

02:29:20
DERYL BAILEY Later as in how late? 

02:29:25
NINA GERSHONOWITZ I don't know, like an hour or two hours later so I can have more sleep. 

02:29:30
DERYL BAILEY Well, uhm, I'd, I don't think that's going to happen in terms of the school starting later but we can talk about some ways that you could, uhm, perhaps to get more sleep the night before that you come to school. Uhm, what time do you go, go to bed? Ah, what are you doing, you know, to prepare for the next day? We can talk about those kinds of things and strategies just as so to help you in that way to, to try to, uhm, get you more sleeps so that when you, when you get here you're, you're on your best, best game. Okay? Okay. Oh, we're out of time for the day, and, uh, but the next time we, we meet I will talk some more about the strategies that I just mentioned to you in terms of, uhm, ways to come, get more, more, uh, rest so that you can be ready prepa, better prepared and Bix I will talk with the, uh, Journalism teacher and the yearbook teacher to see if we can get you, uhm, involved in those activities. Okay? 

02:30:20
BIX WINDBIEL Alright. 

02:30:20
DERYL BAILEY But I need you to come to school tomorrow. 

02:30:20
BIX WINDBIEL  Okay. 

02:30:25
DERYL BAILEY Thank you. 

02:30:25
Vignette 12 Disaggregating Data to Close Achievement and Opportunity Gaps 

02:30:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  This final vignette is entitled Disaggregating Data to Close Achievement and Opportunity Gaps. In this vignette, the 7th grade teachers are very happy because the majority of the students have passed the standardize reading and math test. However, I disaggregated the data and realized that the Latino students have done very poorly. So, I ask for a meeting with the 7th grade teachers so that we can review these results and then come up with some ways that we can addresss this need. 

02:31:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Well, thank you Tamisha, Lourdes for coming. Uhm, first thing I want to say is, you know, congratulations. I heard that the 7th graders did well on the math and reading tests. 

02:31:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT  Yeah, (crosstalk) 

02:31:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Yeah. 

02:31:20
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT we're really proud of them. They did an awesome job. 

02:31:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:31:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Yup. 

02:31:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Which means that you've done an awesome job also. 

02:31:25
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uh hmm. 

02:31:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Slight I think so. (laughs) 

02:31:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  Yeah, yeah. And so, what, uhm, I've like to do also when I get data is, uhm, you know, look at a little bit more deeply and to, sort of, see where we can improve even more... (crosstalk) 

02:31:40
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:31:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...and, uhm, so I disaggregated the data and I just want to, sort of, check in with both of you. Do, do you know what I mean by that disaggregating the data? 

02:31:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT No. 

02:31:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL No. 

02:31:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh-uh. 

02:31:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL It's actually very fancy way of saying that we, sort of, uhm, it take slices of the data and look at different groups and see how they're doing. So, we see how boys are doing, how girls are doing, how Latinos are doing, how, those unframed reduce lunch maybe doing, how the persons of African-American decent maybe doing so that we can see perhaps maybe there are certain groups that have needs that we can address differently so that everyone can do well. 

02:32:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT I'm okay. (crosstalk) 

02:32:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL So, uhm, so what I do is I disaggregated the data and one of the things that I found with that the Latino students were, uh, significantly, did significantly lower than, uhm, the other students in class. And me, (crosstalk) 

02:32:30
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Significantly? Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:32:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah, meaning that, many of them actually did not pass. Ah, so even though the majority of the 7th graders did pass, uhm, the majority, the Latino students didn't. And so, I guess I just wanted... (crosstalk) 

02:32:45
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Oh(ph). 

02:32:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...to bring that to your attention and you're, sort of, you know, think with you together what do you think that might be about? 

02:32:50
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  Geez, well, uh, I know that in my classes, so, some of the Latino students they do have difficulty getting their work on time and, and during their homework and I, I've spoken to them about it, uhm, but I don't know with maybe they're not getting additional support at home or assistance at home but I know that getting them to do their homework has been a challenge all year long. 

02:33:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:15
DR. LOURDES RIVERA I don't know if, (crosstalk) 

02:33:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:15
DR. LOURDES RIVERA if that's similar Tamisha to you. (crosstalk) 

02:33:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT That is, that is very similar, you know, often coming to, uhm, to school unprepared as well. 

02:33:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uhm, by not having their assignments, worked their assignments... (crosstalk) 

02:33:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah. 

02:33:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...usually have been started but not completed. So, I, I, (crosstalk) 

02:33:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:30
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT I get that, there have been, uhm, some phone calls made home to the parents... (crosstalk) 

02:33:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:35
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ..but often... 

02:33:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:33:35
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...I haven't been able to reach them. So. 

02:33:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. So, I guess from both of you I'm hearing that perhaps maybe one of the issues is that there have been really been, you know, uhm, hunting in their assignments and, uhm, and that, that been, that certainly affects grades and it certainly... (crosstalk) 

02:33:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:33:50
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:33:50
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...affects how much they're learning. Uhm, how about going back to what you're saying, how about, you know, the day that they took the test, did you notice anything about, uhm, they're coming in on time or they're preparation? 

02:34:05
DR. LOURDES RIVERA Well, you know, lo, looking back on it, you know, uhm, along with the, the not bringing their assignments they, they sometimes do tend to be late to class, uhm, (crosstalk) 

02:34:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

02:34:15
DR. LOURDES RIVERA they tend to hang out maybe outside of class before coming in and... (crosstalk) 

02:34:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:34:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA ...it takes a little bit of time to, sort of, get them to refocus. 

02:34:20
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. 

02:34:20
DR. LOURDES RIVERA  But, you know, that's, you know, that's kind of part for the course with, with moves of 7th graders. I don't know if. (crosstalk) 

02:34:30
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:34:30
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah, I think that's pretty part, yeah, a, perhaps maybe what they might need is just a little bit more support and perhaps maybe... (crosstalk) 

02:34:35
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Yeah. 

02:34:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...for the Latino parents to understand a little bit more fully, uhm, how important these standardized tests are for their future, for their children's future 'coz one thing that I have found is that oftentimes the parents don't really understand the U.S. educational system and... (crosstalk) 

02:34:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:34:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...they don't really understand the test and how... (crosstalk) 

02:34:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:34:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...important the tests are for their children's future 'coz they really do care about their children. But many of them, back in their home countries, they really didn't, you know, go to, some of them didn't go to school and some of them even if they did, the educational system is so differnet. So, I guess one of the things I was thinking about was perhaps maybe, uhm, having some type of workshops with, uhm, bilingual, in English and Spanish, with the parents. And then, uhm, I could work on it with both of you or I can do it on my own or, uhm, maybe with, uhm, someone else. And just deserves the, to offer some, uhm, to help the parents understand a little bit more about the importance of this test. (crosstalk) 

02:35:40
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:35:40
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL The importance of, uhm, really being able to do this with, for their child's future. And I was wondering if you would be interested in something like that. 

02:35:50
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Well, I, I think that will be a great idea and, and I'd be more than... (crosstalk) 

02:35:50
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:35:50
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...happy to work with you... (crosstalk) 

02:35:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:35:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:35:55
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...on getting that. I think that, uhm, one of the, you know, Tamisha mentioned before that, you know, sometimes getting the hold of the parents is difficult and I think it's, you know, they're working really hard... (crosstalk) 

02:36:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

02:36:05
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...and may have two jobs and I think that finding ways that maybe we can support the kids and the parents in this process would be a good idea. 

02:36:10
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:36:10
DR. LAURA ROBERTS I guess, we, I just never really thought about it... (crosstalk) 

02:36:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:36:15
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...that way... (crosstalk) 

02:36:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:36:15
DR. LAURA ROBERTS ...prior to this. (crosstalk) 

02:36:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT And also giving a workshop or training or, uhm, something like that for the parents at times that would be, uhm, sort of, flexible about their on work schedules... (crosstalk) 

02:36:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

02:36:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...and also they work really hard and, uhm, (crosstalk) 

02:36:25
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yes. 

02:36:25
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT  you might wanna think about it during and after school hours or even, you know, on the weekends which many of them... (crosstalk) 

02:36:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Yeah. 

02:36:35
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT ...may be off. So. 

02:36:35
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL I was actually thinking perhaps maybe in the weekends and perhaps maybe I know, uhm, man, some of the parents and they all go to a common church and perhaps... (crosstalk) 

02:36:45
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Well. 

02:36:45
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...maybe we could even do it with, you know, some of the parents at the church, uhm, and in that way maybe we can even get the minister to a, sort of, you know, uh, be involved in this and to help and the kids... (crosstalk) 

02:36:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:36:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL ...you know, understand a little bit more about how this is important as well as the parents. 

02:37:00
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:37:00
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. 

02:37:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uhm, so, perhaps maybe we could, you know, think about that and, uh, work on something like that. 

02:37:05
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Okay. 

02:37:05
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT That sounds great. 

02:37:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay, (crosstalk) 

02:37:05
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Yeah. 

02:37:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL  wonderful. Uhm, I think the other thing that I wanted to, uhm, suggest to both of you also (clears throat) is that, uhm, with, uh, in terms of the workshops, that we could also see in ter, in terms of, uh, collecting data those parents who do come, the parents of those children who do come, uhm, even for next year because it might not just be for this year but for next year, how do they do on the standardize test compared to the parent, the children of the parents who haven't come. And, perhaps, maybe then we could have some data to show our principle to say, you know, "Hey, this is something that'll be really important and then maybe then we could actually offer this consistently, (crosstalk) 

02:37:55
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Uh hmm. 

02:37:55
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL uhm, for the next few years and hopefully maybe the word will get around that this is something that will be important. 

02:38:00
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:38:00
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Yeah, that sounds great. 

02:38:00
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL It sounds. 

02:38:00
DR. LAURA ROBERTS  It sounds like a good idea. (crosstalk) 

02:38:05
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Okay, thank you so much for coming in and for thinking this through with me and I'm excited of working, uhm, on this with both of you. 

02:38:10
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Same here. 

02:38:10
DR. LAURA ROBERTS Definitely and thank you for bringing this to our attention. 

02:38:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm. 

02:38:15
DR. LAURA ROBERTS I don't think that we would have looked at it that way. 

02:38:15
DR. TAMISHA BOUKNIGHT Ah, no. (crosstalk) 

02:38:15
KETRIN SAUD MAXWELL Uh hmm, wonderful.
