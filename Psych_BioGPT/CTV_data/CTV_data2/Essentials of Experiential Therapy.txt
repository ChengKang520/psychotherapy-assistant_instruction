00:00:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, well, my name is Jeff Zeig. And our purpose here is to do a clinical demonstration, a live demonstration. And that would entail working with somebody with a circumscribed problem, something that we could accomplish significant amounts, if not everything that needs to be accomplished, within the hour. And over the years, I’ve worked with people who've had phobias and anxiety and depression and habit control problems. So anything in general of that genre would be great. And I’ll ask for a couple of volunteers because we’d like to find some different topics that could be useful to help students to understand some of the essentials of Ericksonian therapy. And I’ll ask for volunteers in just a minute. I’ll choose from a number of people who volunteer and I will appreciate it if you understand that there are some subjects that I just -- I have worked with so many times before that I would really like to find some things that are different so that we have an archive of all of the different sessions that are possible to do with an Ericksonian approach. I want to give a very minimal lecture. And this lecture is on basic principles of an Ericksonian method, which is really about heuristics. Heuristics are simplifying assumptions. You have some choices about how you're going to work in psychotherapy. Your work in psychotherapy could be based on a theory so that your clinical applications follow the theory. Your work in psychotherapy could be based on clinical applications where there is not a lot of supporting theory for the clinical applications, but the clinical applications are so strong that the theory comes secondary to the clinical applications. Your therapy could be based on research so you have to have an empirically based knowledge, empirically based protocol and then your intervention comes from there. In this Ericksonian approach, our intervention comes from heuristics. Heuristics are simplifying assumptions. These simplifying assumptions allow us to be flexible in our approach so that there is no theory of personality, there is not even a strong explicit theory of intervention. Heuristics are simplifying assumptions. Simplifying assumptions are what chess masters use in playing chess. So a simplifying assumption is control the center squares early. A simplifying assumption in stress is protect your king early. A simplifying assumption in chess in overprotection builds an attack. If you overprotect a square, that will build an attack. A simplifying assumption in chess is don’t develop the queen too early. That is also one of my simplifying assumptions in family therapy. So just a very brief excursion through some of the simplifying assumptions that we have in Ericksonian therapy. One is utilization. Utilization is a doctrine that says whatever exists in the therapy situation rather than considering that grist for the mill to analyze, we use that as an opportunity to further the therapy, further the hypnosis. If I was going to turn utilization into a graphic, it would be like this. Whatever is given, you can utilize it to advance the trance, you can utilize it to advance the therapy. All of Erickson’s 400 cases are grounded in the concept of utilization. Utilization is the foundation of solutions. Utilization is the opposite of psychological problems. We could define in a limited way psychological problems as failures in utilization. The person does not believe that he has the resources to cope adequately or to change. But as we know, every smoker knows how to be comfortable without a cigarette. Every schizophrenic knows how to talk in a clear and straight forward way. Every person in a bad relationship knows how to be more sensitive or sensible. Every person who is suffering from depression knows how to change their mood. Every anxious person knows how to manage their tension. But they're not in contact with the capabilities that they have. Those capabilities exist as potentials. So the job of the therapist paradoxically in hypnosis is wake the person up, not put them to sleep, wake them up to their potentialities. And we do that by using this heuristic of utilization. If you utilize what’s available in the situation that often times, not always, because it’s a heuristic, but that often times promote solutions. A second thing is that we individualize treatment. So protocols are something that we eschew. We don’t have protocols for induction. We don’t have protocols for therapy. One of the distinguishing characteristics of an Ericksonian approach is that you invent a new therapy for each patient. Makes it very hard to research. A third principle that we use often is that rather than communicating things directly, we orient towards, orienting towards is a philosophy that every great religious leaders has used. They talk in parallels and metaphors and analogies because the purpose of orienting towards is to stimulate into play some of the realizations that have previously been dormant. Precision, Milton Erickson was the most precise communicator that I ever met, so that each word was chosen surgically, each gesture was chosen surgically, the implication of the words, they were chosen surgically, the implication of the gestures were chosen surgically. The result of that, I never felt so loved in my life. And that was just not about me, but it was about this man who was selling firmed and he was working so hard to have a precise impact with me. So Erickson chose his words like Robert Frost would chose his images in a poem, his words in a poem; like Steven Spielberg would make editorial choices; like Picasso would make choices in painting, each line was done with precision. And I can say to you cheerfully that I can’t do that. But if I’m really good, I think I can approach maybe a 50% to 70% level of precision where I’m really consciously aware of all of the things that I’m doing and monitoring the impact that those have on the patient. Positive expectation, of course you can. So we permeate the room with possibilities. Of course you can, go into a trance. Of course you can experience regression, age) regression in trance. Of course you can cope. Of course you can change. And some of the positive expectations that Erickson presented were in and of themselves curative but in combination with his particular genius, positive hallucinations which is one particular heuristic. Resource orientation, strength takes precedence over pathology. Let's focus on the solutions, let’s focus on the strengths that the person has rather than spending time analyzing the weaknesses. We destabilize. And this is a very difficult concept to get across to people, that using a judicious amount of spice, a destabilization, discontinuities and confusion -- For example, you don’t realize that every movie that you watch is based on misdirection and discontinuity. And -- but it’s the misdirection and discontinuity that makes the art happen. Gift wrapping rather than saying things is part of the orienting towards philosophy. So we may gift-wrap ideas within metaphors, within illusions. We may gift-wrap ideas within tasks that we give the person, symbolic, movements that we use or that we ask from the patient. Gift-wrapping is a way of enlivening the therapy. The patient has to unwrap the gift to discover the solution. So if you think about it in the most simplistic way, the patient comes in with the gift and the gift is the problem. And the problem is gift wrapped in the solution. So the patient is presenting you with that gift, and what you can do is that you can be polite. And similarly, you can give back the patient a gift which is a solution that is gift wrapped in a technic, so that therapy becomes an exchange of presents. I want to how awake you are at 8 in the morning. Therapy is an exchange of presents and meant in both senses. But if the patient is giving you a gift rather than interpreting the gift, the therapist gives back a gift getting the patient to activate to interpret what is the therapist meaning. Now this sounds strange except for the fact that all communication is multi-leveled and interpretive. So there is really nothing other than a kind of incessant politeness that goes along with that kind of approach. Building responsiveness -- euphemism for the induction of hypnosis is to build responsiveness. If you have a seed, an idea or the patient has a seed, an idea, and you want that idea to become implanted and to grow, well, over time the earth has become hardened and it’s become hardened to the extent that it’s not very receptive to seeds. So if you're a good farmer, you’d want to lovingly till and fertilize the soil to bring out the implicit fertility so that you can plant the seed and the seed will have the best opportunity to grow with continued care. So induction is like farming. Induction is like developing a fertile bed of responsiveness so that the seeds that are available can grow. Being strategic, having a goal in mind, working toward that goal, being outcome oriented, seeing where it is that we're going and developing the plan for moving in that direction which by the way adds a lot of drama into the therapy. So Jay Haley in the opening sentence of uncommon therapy defined Ericksonian strategic therapy as when the therapist has a goal in mind and works toward that goal. Now, that was not something that was common in 1973 when Haley was talking about the essentials of strategic therapy. This idea, the last idea guiding associations, that’s the one that’s hardest for me to explain. It’s not our positive and negative cognitions that change our behavior. It’s the complex weave of preconscious associations that drive our behavior. The whole literature of social psychology demonstrates that it is not changing positive cognitions -- negative cognitions to positive cognitions. It’s about the way in which the whole context of psycho physiological contextual associative material drives our behavior. So we create associations that build up and drive behavior. So it is my hope that over the course of the demonstration, you're going to see these heuristics in action, and then you’ll have a cognitive frame from which you can understand some of the things that I'm doing, which may seem a little unusual and mystifying and different from what we would conceive as normal psychotherapy. Okay. Now, because we have to move quickly to move on to the demonstration, I apologize for not being able to explain those ideas in more detail. But I hope that I give you a little orientation and motivate you to learn some things about Ericksonian therapy. Now, what we need is to do an actual live clinical demonstration. So I could do a clinical demonstration on myself, but my gestalt is not that good and I couldn’t do my parts that good in this kind of a situation. So I please need a volunteer, somebody who's willing to work with me on a circumscribed problem, also be willing to be videotaped for posterity. Yes, okay sir. Come on. Come on up. We need to microphone you and we need to get a little help from the assistant. So come this way. Wait one second. He’s going to mike you. And while that's happening, is there any questions about any of these 12 concepts, heuristic concepts, also could be considered basis principles about an Ericksonian approach?Utilization is the most important to me. So a very simple example of utilization is a businessman who is in the hospital, he's having lots of ups and downs, and he’s developed this compulsion and all that he can do is move his arm up and down. And he can’t stop moving his arm up and down. And Erickson recognizes that this is a businessman who's had lots of ups and downs, but rather than interpreting what his behavior means, what Erickson does is he goes to -- he goes into the man and somehow, probably hypnotically gets the man to move his arm faster. And then Erickson works with him a little later and gets him to move his arm on a diagonal. And he can’t stop moving his arm. Please. And then, Erickson gets to work with him more of a diagonal and eventually gets him to move his arm horizontal and he can’t stop moving his arm. And then Erickson takes him down to the carpentry shop in the hospital, the wood working shop, puts sand paper in his hand and gets him sanding wood. So this is the virtue of our faults. Lets find a way to make useful, things that have seemed to be previously problematic. Okay. So hi. 

00:16:15
MARIO Hi, Jeffery. 

00:16:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Hello. Your name is? 

00:16:20
MARIO Mario. 

00:16:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Mario. And Mario, your first language is? 

00:16:20
MARIO Spanish. 

00:16:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Spanish. [non-English narration] 

00:16:30
MARIO [non-English narration] 

00:16:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG  [non-English narration] 

00:16:35
MARIO [non-English narration] 

00:16:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG [non-English narration] I feel better already. So Mario, we’ll have to do this in English. 

00:16:45
MARIO Yes. 

00:16:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG I would much prefer to be able to do it your language, but I think your English is fine. 

00:16:50
MARIO English is fine, thanks. 

00:16:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So Mario, we’re going to do something that's just a little bit -- okay, well, let's start this way. Tell me, what is it that you’d like to accomplish? Let’s say that this hour is tremendously successful. And if this hour is tremendously successful, what is it that you'd have at the end of the hour? 

00:17:15
MARIO I would like to find out how I could really unleash my true inner strength -- 

00:17:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Your true inner strength. 

00:17:20
MARIO --to help-- 

00:17:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Unleash your true inner strength. 

00:17:20
MARIO --to help other people in a much more profound way. 

00:17:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So your goal is to take some of the things that you have accomplished, some of the things that you have developed, and to be, what I would call, generative? 

00:17:45
MARIO Yes. 

00:17:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And to take those gifts and to turn them out into the world and see that those seeds begin to develop and bear fruit. 

00:18:00
MARIO That’s correct. Perfectly described. 

00:18:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. And you – I’m sorry? 

00:18:05
MARIO Perfectly described. 

00:18:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Perfectly described. And what you would like to understand is something about why or how. That part I didn’t get. 

00:18:15
MARIO Well, the thing is that I have felt that sense for many years, in fact I changed my profession. And I feel very, very comfortable with what I do. Nevertheless, I find that within myself there are kind of barriers that I’m not much aware of, like some convictions that I probably have at an unconscious level which is really restraining me from really "blossoming" as a human being. 

00:18:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So you want the blossoming -- part of the idea of blossoming is that it takes this generative cast and you become more generative in the world. 

00:19:00
MARIO Yes. 

00:19:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So you know that these seeds are here. 

00:19:05
MARIO I know. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG You know that the seeds are here and here, and you want to be able to turn them this way, yet, somehow. 

00:19:15
MARIO Yes. 

00:19:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Or is it -- ah, is it something like here or is it something like -- 

00:19:30
MARIO Yeah, it’s more like the first thing like this -- extending the back. 

00:19:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG More like here. Aha, okay. So if I was representing the barrier, the barrier might look something like this. 

00:19:45
MARIO Yes. 

00:19:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG If I wanted to represent that barrier better, could you help me for a moment because I’d like to understand it. 

00:19:55
MARIO Ehm. 

00:19:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So let's have you stand up for a minute, come over here, stand just a step or two away so that you can see better. And now what I am going to do is that suddenly I’m going to change my state -- 

00:20:15
MARIO Okay. 

00:20:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG -- and I'm going into the barrier. And I’m representing the barrier that has prevented you from doing those kind of generative things that you’ve wanted to do. Okay? 

00:20:30
MARIO Okay. 

00:20:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So look at me as I represent the barrier. How am I doing representing the barrier? 

00:20:40
MARIO You are too static. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG I’m sorry? 

00:20:40
MARIO Too static. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Too static. 

00:20:45
MARIO Like too frozen. 

00:20:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. 

00:20:45
MARIO I don’t feel within myself that kind of-- 

00:20:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So be my stage director and help me to better represent the barrier. 

00:20:55
MARIO Okay. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG What do I do? 

00:20:55
MARIO  I would see more anxiety in your face. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. So I feel -- you see more anxiety. 

00:21:10
MARIO But it’s like part of you is trying to move forward and a part of you is trying to take you backwards. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Right. Well, the part of me that wants to move forward is the generative-- 

00:21:20
MARIO Yes. Yes. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And the part that’s holding me back has been the barrier. 

00:21:25
MARIO Yes, it’s like an inner conflict. 

00:21:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So let’s take them through the transporter, if you could understand the metaphor from early Star Trek. 

00:21:35
MARIO Star Trek, oh, yes. Definitely. 

00:21:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG You right (inaudible ). 

00:21:40
MARIO Yeah. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. And we just took them through the transporter and here is the generative part and here is the barrier, and I want to do the barrier and the barrier is based on some seeming anxiety. 

00:21:55
MARIO Yes. Yes. Yes. What this coming up to me is there is a very strong fear of failure. 

00:22:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Fear of failure? 

00:22:00
MARIO Yeah. 

00:22:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So help me -- sit down here for just a minute. Okay. And Mario, what I’d like you to do for a moment is to scan your body. And for example, if you were Japanese and I said to you as a Japanese man, point to yourself, a Japanese person would do this. If I said to a western person point to yourself, western person would do that. So for a moment I’d like you to just close your eyes, scan your body. And as you scan your body intuitively, and as intuitively as you can, care to be right now scanning your body. I’d like you to just intuitively point to that place where inside in some secret place there’s been the barrier. 

00:23:15
MARIO The barrier is in the back. 

00:23:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So point to it. 

00:23:20
MARIO Here. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. Great. Now hold that for a minute and feel the barrier, and then as you can feel the barrier, tell me what is it like? 

00:23:40
MARIO I feel pain. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG It’s pain. 

00:23:45
MARIO Yes. I feel a kind of-- 

00:23:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Is it a dull pain, a sharp pain, ehh--? 

00:23:45
MARIO It’s a mixture between sharp and dull pain because it has the sharp quality, at the same time is quite widespread. 

00:23:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Intermittent pain, continuous pain? 

00:24:00
MARIO Yes, it’s kind of continuous pain. 

00:24:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Continuous pain. Sharp pain, a dull pain, a continuous pain. Yes? 

00:24:05
MARIO Yes. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, great. And then tell me something else about the quality of that barrier, that pain. And the quality of that is that it’s red, it’s -- 

00:24:20
MARIO It’s brown. 

00:24:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Brown. And what shape is it? 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Is it regular, irregular? 

00:24:30
MARIO You know what’s an amoeba? 

00:24:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG An amoeba? Okay. So it’s an amorphous kind of shape. 

00:24:35
MARIO Yes. 

00:24:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, great. And what else can you tell me about the barrier? 

00:24:45
MARIO That as I’m paying attention to it part of the pain is going away. 

00:24:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Oh, yes. So this is pretty interesting, that there is something that allows the power of your gentle attentiveness. And the power of your gentle attentiveness becomes a kind of solvent just like you could have a chemical that would dissolve something that was previously solid, and we’d call that a solvent, that your very attention, yes, becomes a kind of solvent that changes some things that could be really essential things to change about the quality of that pain that has been also called barrier, that has -- also be called some anxiety or some specific fear in the past. 

00:25:50
MARIO Hm. 

00:25:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Right. Got it. What else can you tell me about that right now? 

00:26:00
MARIO I think that combined with this kind of back pain is something with my breathing. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Something with your breathing? 

00:26:10
MARIO Yeah. 

00:26:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yes. 

00:26:10
MARIO Yeah. 

00:26:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And what is that something with your breathing? How would you characterize that? 

00:26:15
MARIO It’s -- it’s a feeling that I cannot I cannot breath as deeply as I could and as a healthy life would advise to do. 

00:26:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yes. So it could be that the constriction in your breathing is something that has been subsequent to experiencing the barrier. And it could be that possibly the constriction of your breathing has been a trigger. 

00:26:55
MARIO Might be. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Might be. Now would be an interesting thing to -- take a moment to really reflect on -- and to really reflect for a moment on previous times in which you’ve come into the barrier and that barrier has been there as a kind of anxiety or a kind of pain, continuous, perhaps something to do with failure. And then as you reflect back on those previous times as if you were going back in time in a kind of sequential way, then you might see what insights you can have, what reflections you can have about whether it’s been the case that the constriction in breathing has been the trigger or that the constriction in breathing has been the result. 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Take just a few minutes of clock time but subjectively all the time in the world that you might need. And tell me, what is it that you discover? 

00:28:25
MARIO [non-English narration] I cannot find anything coming up. 

00:28:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yet you can reflect back and you can remember other times that the barrier has been there. You can reflect back and realize that there’s other times that suddenly you got the inspiration, okay, I want to do things that are generative. And when suddenly that inspiration really comes to mind and you get that feeling, that felt sense, I want to do something that’s generative. Then there have been times in which the barrier has made itself known. 

00:29:20
MARIO Yeah, what's coming -- coming to me is that sometimes I think I live according to some rules that I might not be conscious of. And yes, a feeling of breaking those rules give me a sense that something terrible is going to happen. 

00:29:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Something terrible could happen if you-- 

00:29:50
MARIO Break. 

00:29:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG The rule. 

00:29:55
MARIO Some rules. 

00:29:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And rules -- rules could be guidelines and rules could be laws. 

00:30:10
MARIO Hmm. Yeah, what I am experiencing is much more a load than a guidance. It's-- 

00:30:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG A load. 

00:30:20
MARIO Yes, it's-- 

00:30:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Like a law. 

00:30:20
MARIO Yeah, like a weight. 

00:30:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. Okay, great. So help me by coming back and taking a deep breadth and just stretching and doing something physical that will change your state for a moment. Smiling is a great thing to do. Okay, fantastic. Watch me for a moment, right? And what I will do -- or you do it for me and let’s do it in a kind of symbolic way. 

00:30:55
MARIO Okay. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Go back into the barrier for a second. 

00:30:55
MARIO Hmm. 

00:30:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, great. And then take the barrier and hand it to me. And I’ve got it and I’m going to hold it and I’m going to curiously treasure it for a moment, because it’s been part of you. And I’m going to appreciate it, because it seems like there's something about it that has been intrinsically interesting, even if that we’re only the energy that has been put into the barrier. And then once I’ve honored it, appreciated it, acknowledged it, accepted it for what it was, then what I’m going to do is I’m going to take that and I’m going to put it into my back so that I can feel that sharp and dull and continuous pain and some of the acute accoutrements of that, that may have something to do with anxiety or failure, and something to do with breathing. And then I’m just going to put myself here and I’m going to be your barrier for a moment-- 

00:32:15
MARIO Okay. 

00:32:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG --because I want you to take a moment to see it. Is that alright? 

00:32:20
MARIO That's perfect. 

00:32:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, great. Now, when I go into this barrier I want to tell you my projections. So I’m not trying to foist these on you. They’re just what I feel when I go into the barrier. Would that be okay? 

00:32:40
MARIO Yes. 

00:32:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. So when I go into the barrier, the first thing I want to do is to close my eyes and it’s as if I’m convoluted and I’m going inside my shell. Are we good friends now? 

00:32:55
MARIO Yeah. 

00:32:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG If I talked about a cephaloanal insertion, it wouldn’t offend you in any way? Because if you had a cephaloanal insertion it would mean that you needed an optirectomy to prevent you from having a shitty outlook on life. 

00:33:10
MARIO I’m already -- I’m already quite confused. 

00:33:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Ehh, confusion could be a herald of change and it would be easier for them to see than it would be for you to experience from the outside but you reflect on it. So when I go into this barrier and I start feeling that dull and continuous pain, the first thing I want to do is to close my eyes, I want to roll my shoulders down, and as I do that I start to constrict my breathing. And I can’t get a full breath of air. And then I start to feel warm in my temple, especially my left temple. And there's something about going into this state where I feel kind of paralyzed, like I don’t have the energy or even a strong inclination to move. And yet curiously, I suppose that like somebody living in an igloo, it’s become comfortable for me or at least familiar. And I don’t have the impetus to move. Now this little calling that I can hear in my mind that says generative, and I can hear that little calling in my mind and I can conceptualize what it is that I want to do and where it is that I want to be. But once I’m here, it feels to me as if I’m stuck. So how could you relate to my projections about what it was like to be in the barrier, and also please what did it look like from the outside? 

00:35:05
MARIO It was -- it was very powerful what you did because sometimes when I feel these barriers I get angry with myself because I have been struggling for so long. And when I saw you in that posture like really without that energy and being stagnant(ph) I felt the love compassion for myself because I have to feel -- I can feel very proud of myself because despite the fact that many times I have felt in such a way I kept going and I didn’t quit. 

00:35:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yes. And just -- that’s fabulous. And so, you have felt this calling and then this sense that even though there is gravity that your movement can be this way and that you don’t have to -- alright? And so, then I could feel some of the sense of pride, you know. Now, really not because we have Professor Kernberg(ph) in the room, actually for another reason, when I go into that state -- just because of my own curiosity and perhaps because it may have relevance and impact for you, when I go into that state and I’m into the barrier, two things, one thing is that I feel young like this is -- like I'm a little boy, like I’m young, that’s my feeling. And the second thing is a question that I’d like to ask. When you looked at me and if you started to think back in your life, who was it that you know in your family history who was most apt to access the barrier? 

00:37:30
MARIO To access, what do you mean by that? 

00:37:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Go into this state. Who is it in your family history, who is more like this? 

00:37:40
MARIO Probably my mother. 

00:37:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Your mother. And compared to your mother, are you junior grade, you’re less-- 

00:37:45
MARIO I'm-- 

00:37:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG You're less than your mother? Your mother’s barrier was stronger than yours? Your mother’s barrier was equal to yours? Your mother-- 

00:37:55
MARIO I don’t know I was thinking of the posture. I mean, sometimes -- yeah, sometimes that was her posture. 

00:38:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And could it have been that anxiety or fear of failure or something that-- 

00:38:10
MARIO I don’t think. I don’t think. 

00:38:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG You get somehow -- and I’d like you to think about it, and like you to -- I don't mean to rush you. 

00:38:25
MARIO No, no, that's fine. 

00:38:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG But to just move things forward if you trust that I can help you with that-- 

00:38:30
MARIO Absolutely. 

00:38:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. So, then this idea that there's something relevant that you may think that could be related to your mother. 

00:38:40
MARIO Yeah. 

00:38:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG I was talking with a young man -- please excuse me, okay. I know that I’m pushing things-- 

00:38:50
MARIO No, that’s fine. I appreciate it. 

00:38:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And I don’t mean to be rude or cut you off or anything like that. 

00:38:55
MARIO I know that definitely. In my family my father had -- he was always -- he was a great -- a great dad. He was the person who always knew what to do. 

00:39:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So he could-- 

00:39:10
MARIO Yeah, exactly. And my mother was much more like always looking at what she should do and they were a very happy couple. 

00:39:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So your mother was more like this, your father was more like this? 

00:39:30
MARIO Yeah, I admired my father and I didn’t admire that much my mother until when my father passed away five years -- six years ago. One year after he passed away my mother got very, very sick, she almost died. And I didn’t imagine that seeing her so sick could have such an impact in my life. I felt at that time that I was strong that I could use a lot of tools to keep me calm. And I really found a sense of vulnerability that I have never ever felt in my life. 

00:40:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Vulnerability and -- 

00:40:20
MARIO Or fragility. 

00:40:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And an even more global understanding of the seasons of life and the fragility of life and the importance of having a mission. 

00:40:30
MARIO Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:40:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And your mother may not have been able to achieve her mission. 

00:40:40
MARIO When she recovered -- and she gave us an example of the power of her spirit to recover, because she was 52 days in the intensive care unit. When she recovered, she became an example for all of as of her true power. So the sense that I had is that although I am -- I will be always grateful to my father, I could see like two models at home. 

00:41:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And this became a defining moment. 

00:41:10
MARIO Yeah. 

00:41:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG A defining moment for her. 

00:41:15
MARIO Yeah. 

00:41:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Just like any man could have a defining moment and know the moment that he was a boy and suddenly there was a defining moment, I am a man. And anyone can have defining moment, that even if you had multiple degrees there could be a defining moment, nothing more complex than the way in which somebody smiles at you and suddenly you realize, I’m a professional, or there could be a defining moment where somebody suddenly realizes I have a mission and that’s what I can do. Now, I’m going to go back in time for just a moment, and because we have so little time I apologetically say that I’m pushing things through. 

00:42:05
MARIO That’s fine. 

00:42:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG But that would give your sometime to reflect afterwards. It was my experience of Ericsson where I would see him and I would be a little disoriented and confused and hours later something would come back and days later something would come back, and weeks and months. And there was a structure that was inherent that allowed those tiny time capsules to go off. I was seeing a young boy, 17, and he had a wicked, wicked addiction. And his addiction, you know, wasn’t like this, his addiction was drugs. And so, as I was talking with him I said, well, tell me about your father. His father was in his 50s and still in rehab. And I said to the boy, if I grew up in your family -- if I grew up in your family, I would have the same problem, that in some ways you’re an interchangeable part. I know that shocked him, but it was something I was totally congruent with. I believe that if I grew up in his family I would have experimented as wickedly with drugs as he did. And once I gave him a chance to just get through his confusion about how I would say something that bold, I said to him, you know, you had an experiential need to live your parents’ conundrum. You needed to know experientially, just like riding a bicycle is something that you learn experientially, you needed to learn experientially about your father’s conundrum. You needed to learn experientially this is the conundrum that you were born into. And I explained to him, well, there's going to be a moment in which you stop and you do what it is that you are destined to do, because then you’ve had enough time to explore that conundrum and recognize that if I was growing up in your family I would have had the same concern and the same issue and that there is a defining moment where you can suddenly say, breaking away from the gravity of the past this is who I am. Now, if I said to you before to point to that part of you that had been the barrier, where do you keep your generativity? 

00:44:55
MARIO Here. 

00:44:55
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Here. Can you just hold that for a moment and feel the warmth of your hand and the support of your hand and the way in which your eyes became softer and your breathing became fuller? And that part of you that is generative that you keep here, help me to understand it, what is generative life? 

00:45:25
MARIO Is the ability to reach people through communication. 

00:45:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And your connection is really good and I can feel that connection, to reach people through communication. What do you want to reach them with? What is your message? 

00:45:40
MARIO My message is that within every human being there is a lot of beauty, wisdom, laugh, creativity, energy, serenity and peace, that what we are living is just a dream, that when we're awake we will see that problems resolve. 

00:46:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. So, the idea of this generativity is that the problems, they can dissolve and what the orientation can be is to love and hope and connection and what is meaningful. And one of the things that's really meaningful to you is to be generative. 

00:46:25
MARIO Yeah. 

00:46:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So, I would take a little more time with that normally, but if it’s alright with you, can you give me your generativity for a moment? And I’m going to hold your generativity and I’m going to feel it and appreciate it and I’m going to admire it. And then, if it’s alright with you, I’m going to take it and I’m going to put it into my body so that I can feel your generativity, is that all right? 

00:47:00
MARIO Yes, it is. 

00:47:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay. So as I feel your generativity, again telling you my projections of what it’s like, like by compulsion was to just turn to the left and my compulsion was to just sweep my arm and that there was something that was like being a conductor and bringing out the richness of the different instruments in the orchestra, knowing that each instrument and each of the musicians had their own style and that I wanted to help them to bring out that richness and so I could feel my arm and it was moving, it was a conductor and there was a freedom of breathing and a sense of wanting to smile and a sense of wanting to see and connect, and that suddenly I was in this place that I suppose I could call being generative. How did that look to you? 

00:48:15
MARIO Very beautiful. 

00:48:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Great. Do you want to take the step over there for a minute so that you can get even a different perspective and see it from a little bit of a distance. And so as I took that in, as I put it inside me, there was this immediate move to the left and sweeping and suddenly seeing and connecting and appreciating some of the uniqueness of all of the people who are here and like a conductor wanting to bring forward some of the beauty and some of the talents and some of the inspirations. It was aerobics. Oh yeah, sorry. And so, it's just a lovely feeling and suddenly as I did that I was straight and tall, and I didn’t even realize how I got there. How does that look to you. What can I do to improve it? 

00:49:25
MARIO I think that just what you did looking at everybody and acknowledging that everybody has his or her own talents and wisdom and that there we don’t have to be equal in the sense that we don’t have to have exact -- the same talents or that we could involve ourselves in creating a magic moment like an orchestra -- 

00:49:50
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Right. 

00:49:50
MARIO --I think there was you know the power of synergy and the power of magic. Yeah, I think that’s beautiful because you respect everybody and you don’t want to change anybody. You just want to help that person to go inwards and find out all the beauty and all the possibilities that are here without him or her-- 

00:50:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG So, did you want to be a catalyst? 

00:50:15
MARIO Yes. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And the catalyst has not really changed but the catalyst is something that takes-- 

00:50:20
MARIO Accelerates. 

00:50:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG --what’s there and accelerates-- 

00:50:20
MARIO Yeah. 

00:50:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG --accelerates the reaction, being the catalyst. 

00:50:25
MARIO Yes. 

00:50:25
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Okay, great. So, standing there as you are and looking at me as you are, smiling at me as you are, would it be alright to do some trans work-- 

00:50:35
MARIO To what? 

00:50:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG -- trans work, hypnosis? 

00:50:35
MARIO Yeah. 

00:50:35
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yeah, okay. 

00:50:40
MARIO Yeah. 

00:50:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And so then, what I’d like you to do is to get that focus on me and see me and take a moment when you’re ready and just close your eyes as if you’re allowing your unconscious mind to be a kind of conductor and that you’re allowing your unconscious mind to explore and appreciate, appreciate and explore some of the rhythms that you can feel in your body, as if there is a body of your experience, if there's a mind, conscious and unconscious, and in away that's way that’s curious you can begin to realize the synergy, realize the synergy of bringing together your conscious mind and your unconscious mind and the wisdom of your body and to allow the conduction to have a curious trigger and effect. And Mario, you understand that, my oh my, there is a lot of gravity that we all face and you can really give yourself the nod to understand that. But that as you enter into this trans, there is a sense of the way in which you keep your head unconsciously in that upright position effortlessly, so that even though the implicit gravity of any old situation can be there, there's a new realization of the balanced tone of the muscles of your neck that keep your head in the upright position even though the inexorable forces of gravity have a tendency to drag people down that you can keep yourself in that upright posture. And Mario, I would like to encourage you to just take a free and easy breath and to allow the conduction of that breath to move you, to feel the movements of your hands as if your hands were moving as a conductor to the rhythm of your body. 

00:53:55
[sil.] 

00:54:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And that for a moment just like -- as a little boy you would memorize how to play tennis or how to play football or how to ride a bicycle, I’d like you to memorize that feeling of moving yourself into that upright posture even though those old inexorable forces had their own tendency in the past realizing that you can begin to feel the openness of your breathing and experience the generativity, go -- go -- going into trans. As if you’re really implanting into yourself a memory, a generative memory that could add new life and new realizations in ways that can truly delight you, in ways that can surprise you, in ways that can become you in all senses. And I’d like you to feel that sense in different ways. So I’d like you to explore an experiment, if that’s alright with you, and just turn just a fraction to your left. That’s right. And then to move your arms in that conductive way -- 

00:56:10
[sil.] 

00:56:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG -- and to feel the power of your breathing in the way in which your heads are naturally moves into that upright posture. And then Mario, I’d like you to take two steps towards your right, if that’s alright, and then feel what compels you now and what your unconscious mind generates in terms of your own conduct. 

00:57:00
[sil.] 

00:57:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG And as you’re doing that, Mario, with your eyes closed, you can just look up to the top of your head, take a deep breath and begin to memorize this orientation, because this orientation is something that you want to keep, something that has its own synergy, something that you can have here and now, something that you can continue to evolve there and then and again and again. And when you've begun to do that, then once again I’d like you to just take a deep breath and allow your hands to rest back towards you leg and allow you to come back down to the seat and sit down and open your eyes. Was that empowering to you? 

00:58:20
MARIO It was. 

00:58:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Very empowering? 

00:58:20
MARIO Yeah. 

00:58:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Fantastic. You know, we've eclipsed the time, and so we are needing to end just a little bit abruptly. if that’s alright with you. 

00:58:30
MARIO Yes, it does. 

00:58:30
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Did we accomplish some things that were significant for you? 

00:58:35
MARIO I think we accomplished two things. 

00:58:40
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Yes. 

00:58:40
MARIO One of the things I'm aware of, the other I’m not aware of but I know it’s happening. 

00:58:45
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Fantastic. So you can know that you’ve accomplished something consciously and have the trust that your unconscious can have its own generative way of realizing things. 

00:58:55
MARIO Yes. And I would like to really appreciate your way of relating with me and I also would like to thank the audience for the -- for attention. 

00:59:10
JEFFREY K. ZEIG For me el gusto es mio-- 

00:59:10
MARIO Es mio. 

00:59:15
JEFFREY K. ZEIG es mio. And if I could I would have them sing las mananitas. 

00:59:20
MARIO Las mananitas. 

00:59:20
JEFFREY K. ZEIG Mucho gusto. 

00:59:25
MARIO Gracias, thank you. 

00:59:30
