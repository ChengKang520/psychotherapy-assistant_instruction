UNAUTHORIZED REPRODUCTION OF THIS MATERIAL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY ANY MEANS, IS LEGALLY PROHIBITED TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY What do you think will be different about doing (inaudible ) from what you’re doing? I’m kind of curious what the rumors are? What are you worried about? 

00:00:50
Well, everyone is like, “aren’t you gonna be nervous? He’s gonna be by in the mirror?” And I said, “well, I heard he’s not scary, and then it’s really fun and…” So I have a little fears about that, like going in there and (inaudible ) in a freeze up or something that… 

00:01:02
JAY HALEY on DIRECTIVE THERAPY Colloid therapy should be fun. The people in such awful distress that you have to have some fun at that situation. There are certain things I would suggest that I would prefer. I would prefer they didn’t ask people how they feel. If you can avoid that, you get a very different interview. And it’s based on an idea that I think would be nice to get rid of them, which is the Theory of Repression. A person has things… ideas repressed, emotions repressed, and they need to be brought out. And if they’re brought out, they’ll be transformed. Usually, in my experience, if they’re brought out, they just do more of it. And if you get somebody who’s angry, and you get him angry, he just gets more angry, he doesn’t have it disappear. That I would recommend. You know, if you really want to ask people how they feel quiet, but I think you’ll find this not most protective. The other is, I think, making interpretations is not helpful. It turns people against you. I mean, they… they appreciate it, “oh, that’s wonderful, that’s interesting! Why are you telling me about myself?” But they don’t like it. I mean, people don’t like insight, let’s put it that way. They will get even with your views. Sometimes they get even with you by staying with you forever. But it’s a… it’s another thing I think is best not to do. You know when you… when you train people out of the community, who aren’t educated, you realize that the therapy was born in the university and that you’re busy doing what the university people do, which is teaching people and focusing on understanding the situation, doing research and all that. When… I think, therapy is a more practical problem. Assume that if you help them understand themselves, they’ll be transformed. And then often you’re disappointed, because they understand themselves and they… they get irritated at what they find. But anyhow, those are the two things I mainly would rather (inaudible ). And I think if you… if you did two interviews side by side, while you’re asking about their emotions, you’ll find them very different interviews, they go into metaphor with how do you feel. They say, I feel in despair or I feel awful or… They… They feel something that’s dramatic. But it hasn’t necessarily have to do with the problem they’ve got to get over. One of the things that I think is important is to learn how to formulate a problem. When people come in and they have something wrong, that they actually that’s a new thing, they come in ordered by the court and that’s a different matter. And their interview… Their case is from the court at the moment? You do, you do? 

00:04:25
Most of mine are, yeah. 

00:04:25
JAY HALEY The court tends to not believe that… or to believe that people don’t change. Therefore, they have to take a kid out of the family, so it won’t be harmed. Or they take the father out of the family, so he won’t do any harm. But you… With the court you have the power to do that. I remember a case where we had… where the father was picking… sexually picking on his son and came into therapy, and was in therapy over two months. And he… he was taken out of the family. A therapist (inaudible ) and he was gone. He was already gone. He just was no longer allowed to… to see anybody in the family. And the court has that power. The therapist was a little lenient, because she thought they were doing well and that the guy was gonna get passed, that she believed they could change, the court personally didn’t believe they could change, and just says, let’s take him out, so they’ve taken him out. And it’s a new therapy, when they take him out and we had compulsory therapy. Usually, you have somebody come to therapy who wants help. (Inaudible ) tradition and every theory is built… built on assumption. Now all of a sudden that’s not the assumption and you have somebody who’s set to have an interview by the court, and when they have… when they come in they don’t wanna be there. And the therapist doesn’t wanna be there if… if the patient doesn’t wanna be there, so neither one wants be there. And it’s kind a group(ph) session. And there’s no techniques worked out how to handle that. I mean, you can’t say, I’ll take therapy three to one and learn how to handle this case, because they’re new. If you go to family, that you would really think to do something with three or four sessions, and the court says 12 sessions, and you got 12 sessions to deal with the matter, no matter how it goes, because you don’t dare do not the 12 sessions if that's the court order, because that will harm the person. Usually, the solution has been to put people in groups whenever they’ve done something wrong, if they're taking drugs, if they… if they’re sex abuse, if they’re victim, if they’re not a victim. And group therapy is so different from family therapy, that you sprain your brain trying to… to work in a group as a family therapist, because groups are made up of individuals who have no relations to each other. They can develop while in there, but even forbidden to see each other, there is no connection. In family therapy you’re changing people in an ongoing relationship. And if you change the relationship, you'll change their behavior and ideas and so on, that's the theory. But if you only are trained in groups, you don’t have to change the family, because the groups mostly have people express themselves and so it was really on their mind and so on. And there is not enough outcome studies to be sure which is the best way to work. I don’t think there’s very many outcome studies on group therapy even though it’s been around for 40 years. Precarious family therapists won’t see a group. They… If they’re asked to see a group they’ll bring in the relatives, because they… they feel there is something in the family that’s the problem. What began to bring family therapy into addiction was the discovery that the addicts saw their families once a week at least, even street addicts, and that their mothers were giving them money so they wouldn’t go to jail or be harmed or whatever. So the family was even financing their habit. And when they found out what was going on, they began to see more sensible to bring new family. And then there were objections to that because if they… a husband was in a group, he wasn't allowed to bring his wife into the group, even if he was bringing her up in every evening, he couldn’t have that connection, which is a real problem. But those are some of the things that are difficult about therapy. I think therapy can be fine for them. One of the things you’re gonna enjoy is good outcome. The… The brief therapy is new to the world. You know, when brief therapy was done in the 50’s, where everything started, the… the… the therapist was condemned for… for being brief. It must have been shallow, (inaudible ) or not they must have been shallow. To see the change for now, I mean, brief therapy is… is the thing. It’s remarkable, you know that… that now you have to do brief therapy. And all of you better who are going into practice, because the insurance companies are gonna do brief therapy. They also have to deal with colleagues(ph). We have a different ideology than you have. And sometimes it’s not possible to negotiate them, they… the patient is caught in between. Usually, you can negotiate if everybody's (inaudible ) or if have so many cases, they’re happy to get this one passed to somebody else. What is assumed in therapy… family therapy is that, a person with a problem is caught between two other people at least, and like a kid is caught between parents in conflict or the teacher in conflict with mother, teacher and the principal in conflict with the mother and the kid. That is, you have a series of conflicts that are trying to… if you think that way. And if you think that way, then you try to resolve the triangles in order to free the person from the behavior they’re caught in. But it’s not always easy to do that, because if you go in or you have somebody else come in, every intervention, you may disagree with the therapist who is in there to produce a coalition with you and somebody else, then there is a… if you step… if the mother is handling a kid and you step in and just dodge her for in some form, she’ll be… the kid will then be in conflict between the teacher and you or whoever the third person is, if you think that way. One other thing that it emphasizes, that had struck me over the years is we’re used to think we were gonna find out the truth, that if a person had a symptom, we could explore that in the past and so on, and we’d come up with the explanation that was true. This was why the person had that symptom. And I think, more sensible people now have theories that they don’t believe are true. I mean, they don’t have to be true, if it’s a good… If you have a theory that mother and father are in conflict, produce the child problem, it doesn’t mean that’s true, it means that’s the best theory you can have, because you then deal with mother and father in such a way that they’ll help the kid. It gives you something to do and a triangle to be in. And that doesn’t mean it's true. Truth is something else. But you need to be free to have theories that are not necessarily true, but are very helpful to you. And I think that’s a new thing in the world. If you're just thinking some other new things you face that… we had to face, like we used to only deal with the (inaudible ) only, deal with the past, that you explored the past to find out the source and history of symptoms in order to bring the things to mind and get rid of the symptoms, and the past was sacred in the sense. Debates were over whether this person must have had this experience or that experience and sex abuse or not sex abused, but it’s a… it’s a past that’s now becoming (inaudible . The people… Fewer people I think are realizing if I just explore the past of this person I’ll understand, because the past is precarious. You know we used to deal with this with Milton Erickson. He used hypnosis to change the past, and did it pretty well. And that was occurring at a time when the people were realizing that they didn’t have to change the past. If you do it well, you could take other approaches and give directives and do things. Did you ever hear of the February Man? No! Well, that was the case for Milton Erickson to change the past. He had a woman come in who said she was lonely and had always been lonely,, and she was very (inaudible ), because she didn’t (inaudible ) properly, because she had such an unhappy past. So he hypnotized her. And he took her back to childhood and had her imagine she was a child again, and a man came to visit her father. And she let him in and her father was worried at the time, so she started talking to this visitor. She called him the February Man, because he came in February. So she had a nice time with this nice gentleman and she remembered that was a very pleasant time. And then he took her forward to a few years later, and the February Man showed up again. And he took her through the experience with her, they played games together and she enjoyed that childhood together. And then he took her forward again to two or three years to when she was older. I mean, took her up through… up to adulthood, and woke her up, and she began to draw on what her experience has been and she really said, I really didn’t have such a bad past and (inaudible ), should you change her past or shouldn’t you, even though it might relieve her mind? So it’s… those kind of questions come up. Once you start taking action to change people with directives and such. But that’s the only man I know that… that deliberately set out to change the past and did it hypnotically to see how extreme he could do it. And also did any of you or all of you have any experience with hypnosis? Nobody! Well, I think it’s a gap in your training, but it’s not an unusual gap, because for a long time hypnosis was used by dealing with the people according to the field. And one of the things, that it’s nice training, even if you don't use it, I think. Because it teaches you to listen carefully, because you are gonna do something careful. And it teaches you to… to be precise when… …of a subject, their hand will get heavier and heavier and feel like lifting up, they’ll never lift the hand, because you didn’t ask them to lift the hand, you asked them to feel like lifting the hand. And once you want to get that kind of precision in your directives, you get… you get better results in your directives. A nicely defined symptom is often resolved pretty quickly with hypnosis. It teaches you to think more broadly about things, more metaphorically. You think of things you haven’t thought of. It’s… It’s a curious phenomenon. It’s also a… a phenomenon that is mysterious in some way. Sometimes you have remarkable success with it and often you don’t always know why, you know. You know, the things that began to be tried was, hypnosis with the whole family, and they never really took on, with couples it did. (Inaudible ) we take for granted, didn’t just appear out of nowhere. I was in Batson’s project in California in Minnow Park(ph). And in the 1950’s, we were just beginning to see all the families. And I heard there was a guy who was seeing families in San Leandro in a juvenile home. And so I went over to see him. There was only two or three in the country that I knew were seeing all families for therapy. So it was always interesting to find a new one. People began to see, knew that family therapy was not even making an issue of it. They fell into it more naturally. Anyhow, I heard he… his name was Philip Wander(ph) and I heard he was over in San Leandro, so I went over to see him. And I found he had a one-way mirror, which he used for training in psychological testing, which is still how they do it, with the teacher behind the mirror watching somebody test, and he was doing that. And he said he began to do therapy with the mirror. So I asked him how did he come to do that? And he said, well, he had a family come in with a good girl. She was found on the Bali somewhere, drunk and she was brought in. And he tested her and she came out with no neurotic problems, which he felt therefore she should have no (inaudible ), but the test say never must be true. So he turned the rules. He told the parents she was normal. And two or three months later she showed up on the bar in a Bali town drunk again. So they brought her back. So he was curious (inaudible ) on this, and he wondered for the first time, what kind of a family does she come from? And so, he brought the family in and then he put them behind the mirror, well, he went behind the mirror and put them in the room and went behind the mirror. And, he watched the family together and he saw them… he saw them very denial(ph) really. The father said to the girl, can you get cigarettes here? And the mother says whether they are not aware? And this was a girl who had some serious problems. So, Philip Wander(ph) was a very intense guy, he’s still around, he’s still at Berkeley. And he went around and… to the door of the other room, he pulled the father on into the hall, and he said, “do you love your daughter?” The father said, “yes.” And Philip Wander(ph) said, “you go in there and tell yourself.” So he went in there, and took about 10 minutes, but he said I love you. And everybody then got emotional. The mother was… began to cry, the girl began to cry. The mother said, “where have you been?” The girl said, “I saw a fellow, I was lost.” And he was so pleased that he asked them to come back and do this again. And then he began a series of treatments in which he puts the family in the room and the first thing, he pulled them out one at a time to talk to. Then he began to go in himself. Everybody does a therapy that fits their personality. And he didn’t wanna be that intense to that family, so he stopped going in and stayed behind the mirror. And then he would call one (inaudible ). He did various things with this mirror. And we put in a mirror in place of his project, because we saw… I saw… I basically saw that you could see a family for the first time actually dealing with each other without having a huge expensive film and so on. So, we put the mirror and then we began to have a lot of visitors. And all the visitors admired the mirror and thought that’s what family therapy is. And therefore put in mirrors, and then put them around the country, (inaudible ). There are a number of people who… who got into family therapy in some inadvertent way. I’ll tell you how I did it was. I was a hypnotherapist and marriage therapist back in the 50’s. I was referred a woman, a young 18-year-old who had a shaky hand, she couldn’t hold it still, and she worked at a job she was gonna lose, because she would throw a pencil, because she couldn’t grip it. So she went into therapy with a friend of mine, a physiatrist. And he spent about three months with her and talking about her past maybe. And he sent her to me to see if I could cure the symptom before she lost her job. So I (inaudible ), that’s how we work in those days, I would… I would deal with the symptom while I dealt with deeper problems. Sometimes it was hard to find a deeper problem. But the (inaudible ) she was a very good hypnotic subject and I hypnotized her. And I suggested that her left hand began to shake and the left hand shook. And the right hand stopped shaking, which seemed to me a pretty good neurological test, and there wasn’t something wrong with neurology. And… So I woke her up. And she said, my left hand is shaking now. And I said, wasn’t that better? You’re alright with your left hand? It’s better to have it there than to have it in your right hand. She said, she didn’t want it in any hand. So, I asked her what did she want? And I woke her up with some positive suggestions. I would ask, what if gets worse and people would tell you what if it gets worse, and what if it gets worse than that? And you get the destination of the symptom if you do that. So I asked her, what if this gets worst? She said, “I’ll lose my job.” And I said, “but what if you lose your job? What will happen?” She said, “my husband will have to go to work.” And then I got struck by lightening really. And I realized that we could take up this symptom as related to her husband, but I was never thinking that at that moment. And I brought her husband and found out that… that he just come out of the navy. If he went to college, his wife’s parents would feel that she was supporting him, which she was, to college, and if he didn’t go to college they would feel he was… he wasn’t anybody who was anybody for their daughter, because he wasn’t even going to college. So I asked, “how do your parents feel about this situation?” And the girl said, “my mother calls him everyday and she says, are you coming home today? And then I say, mother I’ve moved, I live here, I’m married.” And the mother says, “that won’t last.” And the next she calls again and says, “are you coming home today?” So that seemed to me related to her shaking her right hand. I began to think in a way she (inaudible ) for that one case. I mean, there was involved (inaudible ) her husband, must be more involved with the in-laws. And then what happened was, I saw her for a few sessions which she got over. Her hands stopped shaking, her husband went to work, her parents began to support the marriage, and I took all the credit. It’s was a very quick successful case. And then I began to think about it and realized it could have been that I didn’t look that what happened was the girl got pregnant. And when she got pregnant, her husband had to go to work to support her. And she had to quit her job soon. And the parents who wanted her back didn’t want her back with a baby. And so, they began to support the marriage instead of turning it down. And this all happened without me, but it happened in the natural stages that happen in peoples lives. And I was realizing that there are stages and that the changes can occur, which if they happen to be in therapy at the time we get the credit. Anyhow, but that’s how I found about it… how I found about that and got into it. And a lot of people just began to… to see… see cases like that as there must be a marital problem if she’s behaving like that sort of thing. Since therein is a theory not changing. 

00:27:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:15
Yeah. 

00:27:20
Exactly like maintaining? 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY I saw that that’s what became the theory of therapy, which is to change. So you have to keep adapting to that. Unless you have that… If the wife goes too far - the husband reacts, if the husband goes too far – then the wife reacts, they both go too far away – the kid reacts, and it stabilizes. Now, to use that as a way of changing out family, there’s a lot of thing to do with all. I think it opened up an awful lot of interesting things, particularly in research and such. Let me give you an example of (inaudible ) tonight. What… What I was doing for a while, a year, was testing families to see if a family (inaudible ) was different from a family with a psychotic, with a family with a neurotic and whatever, testing families and comparing them. And I did it family change after therapy or didn’t they would, it’s a very complicated research when you get into it. (Inaudible ) actual family is talking together, you know, is structure setting so that we could compare them with others. And I remember I was standing behind the mirror and watching a family, I was about to go in and give them a test, and there was a mother, father and a kid. The kid began to look under the table, and father said, “don’t look under the table.” The father said… The mother said, “don’t pick on the kid.” And the father said, “you shouldn’t look under the table.” And then a few minutes later the kid fooled with the microphone. And the father said, “don’t fool with the microphone.” The mother said, “don’t pick on the kid.” The father said, “you shouldn’t fool with the microphone.” And then they did a series of these and what I realized was that’s what we wanted to measure, the way they reacted to each other in that situation. And I (inaudible ) measured, the way we would measure these things was to give them a (inaudible ), to the whole family or to give them a TAT(ph) or… We only had the individual test, we had nothing. But I was so impressed and so in despair watching that family, how would I know if they change after therapy, if I couldn’t see if that sequence stop or go over or whatever you know. It was a difficult research. And we did it, partly it’s a kind of important that if a family has normal children and is no different for a family that has had normal children on certain measurements, then you got a problem in the research. You know let me say a little bit, what we’ll do is when a family comes we’ll sit down and make a plan. We’ll put some time on clarifying problems, because most of the therapies are getting problem cleared, I think that’s (inaudible ). Sometimes you can, if you watch you can do… you can do without getting your problems cleared. I once had a patient who said, he wanted me to treat him without knowing what his problem was, because he didn’t want to reveal his problem. So we did things like that. You have to make certain decisions when you are a therapist. And you have to decide on the units you are going to think in. You can think in terms of one, you can think in terms of two, you can think in terms of three or more. You can think in terms of networks if you’re hooked(ph) to it. That is you can think in individuals and you have a certain range of things you can do. So that if you have somebody who is anxious you can explore their past, you can explore a lot other things with them, lot of causes. If you just use your… your unit as one person and… and there is a vast literature on one person. If you think in terms of the marriage, that she’s married, you can think that she has to have a problem, because her husband has to take care of her. She can’t take care of her unless she has some… some problems or some affairs, that is some couples to have arrangement, where the guy has to take care of his wife and that’s rule they follow. So let me have a two-person theory that is adequate for many purposes, or you can then notice that the mother-in-law is in the middle of this marriage and that’s why the… the woman is caught between her mother and… and her husband, and that’s why she’s anxious. And so, you got to think in three’s. And if you think in three’s, the whole world opens up in a different way, because you have collation theory. Two people can get together against one person or with one person. So you can think in three’s if you want, and we have these choices. And it’s not which one’s the best or which one’s true, it’s which one solves the particular problem you’re trying to deal with at the moment. There is no good theory of marriage therapy and it has been around… (inaudible ) counseling has been around since the 50’s or earlier. AAMFT was actually the marriage counseling organization before (inaudible ). What happens is that they burrow from other theories. And there is an individual theory is I think. The marriage counselors saw the couples individually and hypothesized about them individually. Their relationship to the way they reach their parents and how they behave with their… how the wife behaves with the husband is likely, a mother behave with her father and so on. That is they do that kind of a use of a one-person theory. Now, they also began to think in two’s and began to see people together. And that’s how the family therapy came in. They began to notice that the couple had a… had a person between them. They had a mother-in-law or had a kid or had a professional calling. You can’t even have an idea of marriage. You can’t say I’ll take this marriage which is a lousier one and I’ll make this one a good one. I’ll turn it into a good ideal marriage, because there is no good ideal marriage, they’re just a tremendous variety, that’s what there this. There is people from every culture, there is people from every age, there is people with different backgrounds and class. And every marriage is different. Now if you get a couple who come in, and they’re American college couple who share everything (inaudible ). In the next hour you get a Middle Eastern couple, where they certainly don’t share everything. You have to treat them quite differently. You have to be very adaptive treating them. One of the interesting things that came up in marriage therapy that… that never got completed, which I’m sure you will, was the discovery of the theory that couples follow rules. They started courtship, which will have a couple whatever they do they follow that rule and to make sure uneasy(ph), because you realize everybody follows rules. But for example, you can have a wife who is responsible and a husband who is irresponsible. And whatever they do, she will do the response… she will be responsible and he will be irresponsible. Even in coming into therapy, she will responsibly take the couple into therapy when they are in distress. He will resist and doesn’t want to go into therapy, because he is irresponsible. Everything they do, they’ll do that. And if you step in to… to solve this problem and you say to her, “have you noticed that… that you behave responsibly and he behaves irresponsibly”, the wife will say, “yes, I’ve noticed that, that’s the way he is. He’s absolutely, totally irresponsible, and anybody living with him will have to be responsible, because he’s irresponsible.” And that’s the explanation and that’s the triumph you have in the therapy getting them to say that. And if they say that and there you are and you’re still stuck with… with that group. One of the men… Don Jackson was an early family therapist who died. And he was working out rules like that. And making us realize we didn’t have the rule. And people will obviously follow rules, but that we don’t have them. We… We sort of have them. But for example he (inaudible )… If the wife meets a guy she likes, she begins to initiate a relationship. She begins to go after him and (inaudible ). And then they get married and he just responds and enjoys this opportunities, then they get married. And she wants him to initiate something. I mean, it’s time that he began to come forward and do something. And he doesn’t feel that’s right, because that isn’t the contract. And so he protests that she’s asking too much of him. And she says she is not, he’s supposed to give her something (inaudible ), extend himself somewhat in this marriage. But the marriage is awful. So you have a problem, how can we get out of that? And it’s not easy to get out. What the woman does is begin to regret that she got married and she begins to push the guy to do more. He resists more and more, because that isn’t what he agreed to. And this can go on for years. And they get… they get almost solved and then they get back into it again. But anyhow, those are examples of rules, which if we ever mapped a marriage thoroughly we would… we would have all the rules that the people are dealing with each other. And it’s just not being examined. But that’s one where you think in two’s, whereas one initiates and one responds. If you can’t stand the heat you got to get out of the kitchen. And I think that applies to therapy, that if it begins to touch a person and you have to (inaudible ), because it isn’t your… your case, it’s the client’s case. And if can’t handle it, you better find a way a do it, that’s all. Like the training analysis was (inaudible ) what… what including the clients do. He doesn’t get on coach when he goes through the personal analysis, which can take years. But the training analysis in New York on one time was seven years. And how you can ever get over that ideology is after seven years of five days a week. You know, it’s just remarkable. But anyhow I… the therapy I tend to do is that… is to emphasize that people have to solve their own problems. And the therapist has to solve his or her own problems not managed to take it out on the client or expect the client to help them. And you can feel this is very upsetting, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go ahead and do it. You are in the business of changing people(ph) and you got to change too.
