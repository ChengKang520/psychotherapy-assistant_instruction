SHANNON DERMER Welcome. Thank you for joining us. I am Dr. Dr. Shannon Dermer. I am Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling at Governors State University and today I am going to be talking about optimal wellness with my guest here Dr. Michel and she will be introducing herself in a second but she is specifically going to be talking about adolescence and optimal wellness and adolescence. Tell us a little bit about yourself.

00:00:50
REBECCA MICHEL Sure. So thank you so much Dr. Dermer. Again my name is Dr. Becky Michel. I am an assistant professor here at Governors State University. And I have been working with children and adolescence for the past 15 years or so and I am specifically interested in helping young people develop the best that they can be. And so rather than focus on what's wrong with them, focusing on what's right and I have been doing this kind of work for my whole time in my career so far. And I am trained actually as a strength based educator and so that helps to inform how I work with young adults. 

00:01:25
SHANNON DERMER Great. And do you mind if I call you Becky? 

00:01:30
REBECCA MICHEL That would be great. 

00:01:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Becky Michel. You have background in school counseling as well as like community counseling. 

00:01:40
REBECCA MICHEL Yes community health, yes. 

00:01:40
SHANNON DERMER Right and so you specifically like to I know work with career development with adolescence and older adults but also across the lifespan with a strength based approach. 

00:01:50
REBECCA MICHEL Yes. Absolutely. 

00:01:50
SHANNON DERMER So what exactly does that mean then when you are working with adolescence and taking a strength based approach? 

00:01:55
REBECCA MICHEL Good question, Shannon. So what it means is as you probably know positive psychology is looking at what's right with people and this is a huge paradigm shift from the typical psychology of looking at kind of what's wrong with people, taking a deficits model. And so counseling which is based in wellness is more aligned with positive psychology and so what it means to take strength based approach with adolescence is to look at what's going well in their life, look at what their natural talents and assets are and use that information to figure out how to overcome challenges in their life. So we don't focus only on what's good, we look at the whole spectrum of what are the challenges, what's going okay and then what's going really really well and then we try to use what's going well and what you are good at to overcome those challenges. So kind of rather than moving from like a negative five on a scale to zero, we want to try to move from wherever you are at to a plus two or plus three or even maybe plus five. 

00:03:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Great. So it's not that and I am going to say positive because strength is too hard to say. So a positive approach it's not that you ignore some of the obstacles that they have, it's not that's just not where you start your focus, you acknowledge but then you try to identify all of their strengths to help to focus on that and have them continue to do those but also to use that then to help them to overcome maybe some of the obstacles. 

00:03:30
REBECCA MICHEL That's exactly right and I think that's one of the misconceptions with having strength approach or positive approach is that you just focus only on that and it's not the case. You focus on the whole spectrum. 

00:03:40
SHANNON DERMER And why do you think this is particularly important in your work to use this approach with adolescence? 

00:03:45
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely. So adolescence as we know from a developmental standpoint are really social being and so they want to be connecting with their peers, they want to be forming better social networks. And so and also this is the time when they are creating their identity and so it's very very important to help them learn about what's good about themselves and because that's going to shape and set them up for their self-construct throughout their whole entire life. So if we can teach them what are they naturally good at and help them use those strengths they can be better academically, they can form healthier relationships and then they can, and then that leads to actually better health outcomes, life satisfaction, lots of really, really positive outcomes. 

00:04:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Do you think that's a struggle for some people like the teachers, parents, to maintain that positive outlook one talking to living with, working with adolescence just because adolescence are going through so many changes that they tend to push people buttons a little bit. 

00:04:50
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely. Absolutely. And so that's another reason why this approach sometimes gets some push backs because you think about people come into counseling because they are having usually a challenge right and often times the people in their life, their teachers, their educators, their parents, maybe even their peers are just fed up with them right and so their system is fed up with them, they are fed up with themselves and ultimately they don't know what they can do in order to get out of that place of being stuck and so it's tough when you try to talk with adults specifically about oh let's focus on the strength, let's focus on what's going well, because they just want to complain, right, because they are living at. However what we find is that we can start with the strengths with the adolescence and even with the parents and guardians they have a lot more buy-in for counseling and so rather than just talking about here is all your problems that you have let's focus on what you are good at. It changes the dialog and it allows them to figure out ways to overcome their struggles. 

00:06:00
SHANNON DERMER Great. So what's the specifically for adolescence but also in general when you are using this positive approach I know you are going to do a little demonstration later on but what do you think that I and the people watching need to know before we see the demonstration? 

00:06:15
REBECCA MICHEL Sure I think it's important to know that there are many different ways that optimal development is nurtured and so this can be within oneself like we have been talking about so developmental assets or the strength that people have that's generally the character that somebody has like all the different traits that they have that makes them who they are. There is also a protective factors and risk factors. And we have heard of that before right, so protective factors are aspects of one's life that help buffer against challenges or difficult circumstances whereas risk factors are situations that make a problem worse. So and I will actually talk little bit more about that in a second, and then third it's the environmental aspects of one's life. So the systemic the school, the family, the ones that lives in the community so all three of those areas really contribute to optimal development or on the other hand you know difficult development. And so when you are thinking about adolescence and young adults there is a lots of different developmental domains to focus on. There is social which we will talk about here in a second, a little bit more because that's really, really important for the stage. There is also emotional development and that there is behavioral development, there is cognitive development, there is moral development, there is educational development and so… 

00:07:40
SHANNON DERMER It's a lot of development. 

00:07:40
REBECCA MICHEL There is a lot of developing going on at this stage. 

00:07:45
SHANNON DERMER No wonder those teenagers are cranky. 

00:07:45
REBECCA MICHEL I know and actually it's you are very true because in your brain there is so many different changes that are going on at this time of life and even just from an emotional standpoint, it's so difficult for young people to learn how to regulate their emotions and yet those who do learn how to regulate are able to have much more successful outcomes academically, socially, just even just in their everyday life. 

00:08:15
SHANNON DERMER Wow! So what then for counselors in training or for counselors who are maybe new to this how do you decide I mean, if we assessed all of those all the time would it be in counseling for couple of years? 

00:08:30
REBECCA MICHEL Well it will keep us all employed. 

00:08:30
SHANNON DERMER which is good. But because I also know you like career counseling but how do you make decisions which you should focus in on the most or go the more in depth into because there's a lot of different areas that they are developing in. 

00:08:50
REBECCA MICHEL They definitely are and I think what's important to start with when you are working with this population is to have a comprehensive view of their development and that list I was saying was not even an exhaustive list, there is more areas, right and so what you want to do is you want to do a thorough assessment of course, and often times the assessments the typical assessments even in counseling which is based in the wellness model still are typically deficit focused. So when I say comprehensive assessment I mean, assessments that measure both what's not going well in their life so measuring their depression, or their anxiety, or their social anxiety, or academic, or behavioral concerns but then also measuring what they are good at and so there is lots of different ways to do that. There is different assessments like the strength finder, they are like the VIA strengths. There is also narrative approaches that you can take in order to learn about what people are naturally good at. So you start off by having a good battery of assessments to assess what's going well and then what's a challenge and then you know you look at all the different developmental areas and you think okay where are the problem areas and what's going okay so often times with students I work with adolescence and young adults you focus on the education because some students are engaged in school and some are not engaged. We also often focus on social, the social development because again that time of life is so important for forming connections. 

00:10:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Good. So you mentioned assessments because I think a lot of times we train clinicians whether it's social work psychology counseling that or any of the other mental health fields we train them to be kind of deficit oriented when we do assessments so you are talking about assessment is comprehensive but when you say comprehensive you also mean focusing in on their strength, resilience, things like that and you actually mention I mean the narrative approach is a more talk type assessment but you also mention to I think paper and pencil assessment. What were those? 

00:11:00
REBECCA MICHEL Yeah. So one is the strengths finder, and that's from the Gallup Institute who they put out a lots of surveys and they do quite a bit of research and that you pay for that assessments but it's a computerized assessment. And it gives you really valid and reliable results about your top five strengths or areas of talent and then it also gives you suggestions about how to develop those areas. So and then another and that's I have quite a bit of training and I have been working with the Strength Finder with people throughout the lifespan for years, for almost a decade. And it's a really it's wonderful assessment. The only downside is that it cost money and so one of the pros of different assessments which is the VIA Assessment. This one is free. And it also is very valid and reliable. One of the developers of it is Martin Seligman who is the father of Positive Psychology and so this assessment the wonderful thing about that assessment is that there is a version for youth, so it's from 11 to 17 year old and then there is version for adults. 

00:12:10
SHANNON DERMER That's nice. 

00:12:10
REBECCA MICHEL So, it is. So depending on what age group you are working with and then it takes about 45 minutes to administer. It's about 200 questions. These questions are all about themselves and then you from that assessment you get a list of your top 24 strengths all in order and rank order and one of the really nice things about working with young adults who are experiencing problems is that if you compare me as a young adult who is experiencing problems compared to you I am probably not going to be very good in a lot of things right, I am, socially I might be struggling, academically I am struggling, my family situations is not really that good. So me compared to you maybe I would ranked low but me compared to myself I am going to have some strength that really rise to the top. So it's, this is such a helpful assessment because each of us has all of these 24 strengths. It's just in different order. And so it's helpful to use this assessment specially with young adults who are struggling. 

00:13:20
SHANNON DERMER Well that's great because my background is marital couple and family therapy and counseling and so I can see if I was giving some of these results in a family session or with the parent and child that we are talking about sometimes it's easy for the parents or school teachers or whoever to focusing some of the deficits or negatives but test hold such a powerful place in our society that it could be really helpful for parents to hear those strengths too and it's from an objective test not just the counselor who they have fooled and they are thinking they are good sometimes parents feel like that that my kids fooled the counselor and they are thinking that they are not as bad as they are and it's not the parents are bad they are just struggling also. But it can be I think really nice for the parents to see this objective evaluation of the strengths of their child. 

00:14:10
REBECCA MICHEL And that's such a great point and there has been quite a bit of research on these assessments, these two in particular. There is lots of other ones of course but that so even just seeing the results having the person see the results helps them to act in that way. So if you see that like bravery let's say for example or courage are at the top, you will be more likely to then start acting like that, right, it's like the self fulfilling prophecy and then the same thing with your supportive or you unsupportive network when they see this list then they are going to start expecting you to act like that. So it's really the outcomes are really, really dramatically positive when you give these types of assessment and they have the buy-in about it. 

00:15:00
SHANNON DERMER So that's a great way that the average counselor can use an assessment tool that actually gets integrated into counseling and assessment and intervention and you can see the impact on everyone. It's not just assessment it's part of a total counseling package. 

00:15:15
REBECCA MICHEL It absolutely is and you can what's important is the assessment doesn't just stop of course with the results. It is very important to spend several sessions if possible talking through what the results mean to them, having them take ownership of the results and then finding specific strategies to help them use their strength in creative ways so that about positive psychology in strength based counseling it's not just the quick fix, it's a mindset and so people if you practice gratitude enhancing characteristics for a week maybe somebody might feel grateful for a week but if you can incorporate every night before bed thinking about two things that you are grateful for every single night before bed and figuring out why that grateful thing happened, you will become a more grateful person and that's a long-term developmental positive outcomes that you have experienced. 

00:16:15
SHANNON DERMER Great. Well in a couple of minutes in about two minutes you are going to be doing a demonstration but what else do we need to know before that demonstration? Is there anything else you think we need to know? 

00:16:20
REBECCA MICHEL So I think just it's important to know that adolescence and young adults it's very typical for them to experience struggles in their life specially in their social realm. There is again all of those changes in the brain are happening and so that's causing them to be emotional. That's causing them to be dis-regulated and so the adults and the educators and the parents in people lives and the relationship that they can have with them can help that young person identify what they are good at and identify how to use what they are good at to overcome these challenges that they are experiencing in their life. 

00:17:00
SHANNON DERMER So great. Thank you so much for sharing that brief overview of positive or strength based view to working with adolescence across the lifespan. And I look forward to see you put some of that into action in the demonstration.

CLIENT SESSION 

00:17:20
with Rebecca Michel, Ph.D. 

00:17:20
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:17:25
REBECCA MICHEL Hi, Tina. Welcome back. 

00:17:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT How are you doing? 

00:17:25
REBECCA MICHEL I am doing really good. Thank you so much for agreeing with me again today. I know that as a junior you are very, very busy and with this time of year. 

00:17:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Study. Study. Study. 

00:17:35
REBECCA MICHEL Study. Study. Study. Study. That's what I like to hear. That's what we educators like to hear so but I really wanted to meet with you because I know the last time we talked you were having some troubles getting along with some of the girls in your grade and then I know there was a little bit of academic challenges going on too. So can you just give me an update about where you are at right now maybe with both of those areas and then if there is any other things that have happened since the time we met last. 

00:18:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. So for the girls at school it just seems like I am a different like I like to study and kind of stay on the go with my academics but they like to do other things and I miss out on a lot of stuff. 

00:18:30
REBECCA MICHEL Okay so you miss out on a lot of stuff. 

00:18:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Like parties and stuff like that. 

00:18:35
REBECCA MICHEL And how does that, how is that impacting you, Tina? 

00:18:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Well, when I go to school, I don't hear the latest stuff that happen and I am kind of out of the loop. So it feels, I feel kind of isolated. 

00:18:45
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. That's definitely understandable and it's sounds like it's because you don't like to do some of the same things that some of your other peers like to do. 

00:18:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. Right. 

00:18:55
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. Alright and then how about are there other any people here at school that you do connect with either peers or you know adults? 

00:19:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah I have two friends. I really get along good with them. We study together. And then there is a counselor at school that I have talked to just to kind of have as a sounding board and she is very supportive. 

00:19:20
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. So even though you are experiencing some trouble socially with not being able to connect with your peers in a meaningful way you do have a couple of friends who you share some common values with and then you also have a school counselor who you can talk to about some of these things. 

00:19:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. So that's helpful. 

00:19:40
REBECCA MICHEL Okay that's helpful and so and we will talk a little bit more about this social aspect of your life because I know for most teenagers that's pretty important. 

00:19:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It is. It is. 

00:19:55
REBECCA MICHEL And it impacts lots of different areas of your life. So we will definitely touch on that little bit more. So how about from an academic standpoint you were saying that you are having some academic troubles or some stress associated with that. Can you give me an update on that? 

00:20:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT So this ACT thing math is not really my strong point and that's my struggle and I just I don't see negative and I have been tutoring and I had some support at home but it's not really clicking as much as I wanted to. 

00:20:25
REBECCA MICHEL And that's probably it sounds like pretty frustrating for you. 

00:20:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. 

00:20:30
REBECCA MICHEL Because you seem like you are very motivated student. 

00:20:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. 

00:20:35
REBECCA MICHEL You have taken the steps probably that people have suggested like tutoring, like getting help at home and it's just not working. 

00:20:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:20:40
REBECCA MICHEL So and is it mostly focused around studying for the ACT or is it with your grades in your math classes as well? 

00:20:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It's kind of both because in order to do well on ACT I am in the math class now you need to pass the test and do what you need to do and I know that these materials will be on ACT so it kind of goes hand in hand. 

00:21:00
REBECCA MICHEL Okay and then how about with that two what have you, you have done tutoring and have gotten some support at home are there any other things that you can think of right now that you have tried or that you would be willing to try in order to try to get increase that math self-confidence and ability. 

00:21:20
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Well, one thing I was thinking is I can connect with somebody in my class. The thing is there are couple of kids that are good at math I don't really know them and kind of approaching them for help. It is a little difficult to me. 

00:21:35
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. That's understandable. So couple of people you have identified hey they are really good but they are not really in your social network. 

00:21:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:21:40
REBECCA MICHEL Okay so that's a really good idea. Next some relates kind of to the first thing that we were talking about with the socialization a little bit. 

00:21:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:21:50
REBECCA MICHEL Okay, it sounds good. So and are those the two main presenting challenges that you have in right now Tina or is there anything else that you would like to throw in the table right now? 

00:22:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT No those are the two main things. 

00:22:00
REBECCA MICHEL Those are the two main things okay. So one of the things, Tina, I think that is really, really important for teenagers like yourself is to develop your sense of identity, who are you, who is Tina so if I asked you Tina can you tell me about some of your strengths what you are good at and then some of your weaknesses. Why don't you share with me a little bit about that? 

00:22:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT My strength, I will have to say that I am encourager someone that is really motivated to the finding good in others because that's what I hope someone will do for me. So I think that's a strength. 

00:22:40
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely. That's absolutely a strength. What a wonderful asset to have to support and encourage other people and like you said it sounds like you have some empathy too because you can, you portray you know, that ability to encourage because you know that it feels good to have that back at you. 

00:23:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:23:00
REBECCA MICHEL Good. Okay so that's just strength. Any other strengths? 

00:23:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT My ability to take feedback. 

00:23:05
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. 

00:23:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I want to be good at things. I want to get better at things so if someone can come and tell me you know hey, I think that was good but you can do this to make it better then I am always open to that and I think that's strength. 

00:23:20
REBECCA MICHEL That is absolutely a strength, Tina, so your ability to encourage others, your ability to accept feedback from other people in order to keep growing. 

00:23:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. 

00:23:30
REBECCA MICHEL Very very good. Good. How about any other strengths or limitations? 

00:23:35
REBECCA MICHEL Short comings. 

00:23:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Short comings? 

00:23:40
REBECCA MICHEL Is that okay to you? 

00:23:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah, absolutely. 

00:23:40
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. So I was thinking at times I think it's good to trust people but sometimes trusting to a fault has gotten in the way. 

00:23:55
REBECCA MICHEL Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:23:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT When you, when you look at someone and may not take it as face value you kind of just mistaking finding the good in everything again and ignoring red flags. Like with my friend. 

00:24:10
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. So you see the good in a lot of people and you miss or you don't pay attention to red flags that would help you get a better of their actual character. 

00:24:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. Exactly. 

00:24:25
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. Alright. And how has that impacted you? You said like with your friends, how has that impacted you? 

00:24:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT So I have one friend where I noticed that she was cheating off another girl or she was like drinking and doing stuff like that but I ignored it just trying to find the good and knowing okay well she won't do that to me and then one time we took a testing she tried to look at my paper. And it shouldn't have been a shock to me because I saw her do it before. 

00:24:55
REBECCA MICHEL Okay, but it was shock. 

00:24:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:24:55
REBECCA MICHEL Okay and that impacted you it sounds like and how did that impact your relationship with her? 

00:25:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It made me pull back distance myself a bit and now we are kind of like in different clicks. 

00:25:05
REBECCA MICHEL Okay got you so that has contributed even more to the trouble with socialization that's going on right now. 

00:25:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. Exactly. 

00:25:15
REBECCA MICHEL Alright and that's certainly a breach of trust when we have studied hard and you have worked on the weekends and you get your tutoring and you work right of your family, and you do the work and yet somebody else is trying to cheat off of you. It sounds like that's really frustrating. 

00:25:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It is. 

00:25:30
REBECCA MICHEL So, Tina, I think, you know, you really are at a great point right now you know you are very matured for a junior in high school and you have a really pretty good foundation of a couple of your strengths and then a couple of your how did you say it. 

00:25:50
REBECCA MICHEL Short coming. 

00:25:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Short comings, alright. I like that. A couple of your short comings. And so what we are going to do now is we are going to just talk a little bit more about the strength and about what you are naturally good at. 

00:26:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:26:00
REBECCA MICHEL And if you remember last time that we met I gave you some homework. I know you have enough homework but I gave you some more and you took the VIA Assessment which measured your strengths, which measured some of your strengths and so we are going to go over your results of that if you wouldn't mind. So here you go. So this is character strengths and virtues and this was the youth version of it and so it probably took you about 45 minutes or so… 

00:26:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It was really fun though. 

00:26:30
REBECCA MICHEL Good. That's good to hear. So what was fun about it. 

00:26:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Just being able to identify the good and find all these things that I can do so use in a and put it to use when I go to school or with my friends so, 

00:26:45
REBECCA MICHEL Wow that Tina that is exactly what the purpose of this is. 

00:26:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:26:50
REBECCA MICHEL And so one of the things and a lot of people that I work with actually do find it fun, you know it takes about 30-45 minutes or so but usually that times goes by really really fast because you are answering questions about yourself and you are saying this is who I am. And one of the neat things about this is not only it is free so that's helpful, but also that it gives us a list of 24 different strengths that are all in rank order. So it's not like you only get a list of your top ten you actually see as you can see on your results you see all 24 of them but you see some of them are coming more towards the top, some of them are in the middle, some of them are pretty low. And what we can do you know using this information we can find ways for you to utilize your top strengths more in creative ways and in different areas of your life in order to overcome challenges that you are having so it's, as you mentioned before sometimes with your friends you only see the positive and you don't look at the negative. Well this approach increases us to look at the positive what are you good at but then also look at what's not going well. Use those strengths in order to overcome some of those challenging areas. 

00:28:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:28:10
REBECCA MICHEL So we are not just focusing on one thing we are focusing on the whole continuum what's going great and what's struggling. 

00:28:15
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:28:15
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. 

00:28:15
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:28:15
REBECCA MICHEL So you can see these are your 24 character strength and one of the neat things Tina about this is that this is a really highly reliable, highly valid assessment so basically that means that it's good stuff, it gives you good information, pretty consistent. Now this information can change a little bit overtime. 

00:28:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I was just going to ask you that, can it change? 

00:28:35
REBECCA MICHEL It can it can specially if you, let's say we identify some strength of yours in the middle not in a top, not in the bottom, but you really want to work on those then with time those might move up a little bit in the rank order so certainly but one of the things is that these strengths are categorize into six different areas so the different areas are ubiquitous which means basically they are universal. So these are what scholars and religious leaders, and moral leaders around the world have somewhat agreed that are important traits that people have in order to function at a really, really high level. So those are you can see those are transcendence, temperance, justice, humanity, courage and wisdom. And we will talk more about all of these you know, as we go through our sessions, our counseling sessions. 

00:29:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:29:35
REBECCA MICHEL But today we are going to focus on your top five areas and again you have 24 but we will focus on your top five. So it looks like would you mind just reading your, just the main word of each of your top five. 

00:29:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT okay. Spirituality, forgive and mercy, love, persistence and open mindedness. 

00:30:00
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. And so I am assuming but maybe I shouldn't assume that you may have read through this. Have you read, did you read through this a little bit before? 

00:30:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Just a tiny bit. 

00:30:10
REBECCA MICHEL Just a tiny bit, okay. So we will talk a little bit about what each of these mean and let's just do a little check in to see if you think that this yes that really does sound like me or this doesn't sound like me at all. 

00:30:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:30:25
REBECCA MICHEL And if doesn't sound like you that's fine. We will go through the list and one of your homework assignments will be to pick out another one and we will go to your number six through your number seven and we will focus on that area. 

00:30:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:30:35
REBECCA MICHEL So from your spirituality standpoint, this basically means that you have a set of beliefs that really help to guide you so this doesn't have to be a religious aspect but it's some higher purpose that guides you, does that sound like it checks in with you? 

00:30:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. 

00:30:55
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. It does. You have a smile there. So it sounds like and that's something that I know your faith is something that we have talked about before as being an asset to you. 

00:31:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yes. 

00:31:05
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. So under and that's under transcendence. Under temperance forgiveness and mercy. So this is accepting that people have flaws and being able to move through and forgive them. Now the example that you just gave a few minutes ago about your friend it sounds like you are having some a little bit of trouble forgiving her. Would you say that this isn't area that you typically have as strength giving people a second chance. 

00:31:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Usually, usually but the closer the person is to me that hurts, the harder it is for me to forgive. 

00:31:40
REBECCA MICHEL Which is completely understandable. 

00:31:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:31:45
REBECCA MICHEL Alright because that you have a close relationship with them and then they break that trust and so it's harder so she was somebody who you are very close to. And that was her fault. And so usually this is, this does sound like you though and that maybe one of the reasons why this is such a struggle for you right now because usually you are able to give people second chances but it sounds like you have kind of thought you should have seen those red flags and so you are having a trouble doing forgiving her this time. 

00:32:15
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:32:15
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. And then another one of your strengths is love and this is such an important strength and it's not usually something that we in our society even talk about as a strength. 

00:32:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. I didn't think about that either. 

00:32:30
REBECCA MICHEL Yeah, because most people don't think about that right but it's actually really, really important trait and strength for people to have throughout their whole life. People who have love as a main strength are able to have better relationships overall. They are able to have better life satisfaction, usually they are able to have better partnerships throughout their life so this is a really good one. 

00:32:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:32:50
REBECCA MICHEL Now you are probably going to definitely say that you are this. Right but so basically this is having positive close relationships with others and that's a reciprocal relationship that you have with somebody. So would you say that that's something that you do possess? 

00:33:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Do you really mean romantically? 

00:33:15
REBECCA MICHEL No. I don't mean romantically. So it could be and that's such a good question, Tina, it could be romantically certainly but in this context it's much bigger than that, it's feeling love for humanity, it's feeling love for other people. It's to me it sounds a little bit like you are encouraging of others so but again you tell me if this is you. 

00:33:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah it is. I have a really close relationship with my dad. So I kind of see, see that that we encourage each other back and forth. 

00:33:45
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. That's great. And we have talked about that before and how is such a positive support for you academically and just as you have been grown up really. Okay so love. Then another one of your strengths is persistence so that's finishing what you start setting goals and then finishing them. Does that sound like you? 

00:34:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT that's one of my favorites because I feel like that one stands out the most because I always want to if I start something I want to finish it whether it's like my school work, or sport or art projects whatever it is it's really important for me to see it through and not give up along the way. 

00:34:25
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely and you Tina you are so goal oriented and that has helped you achieve a lot of success so far in your academics. And so persistence is also just a really, really helpful strength to have in order to reach goals of course, really throughout your life. So this is something that's really going to continue to keep helping you. 

00:34:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:34:45
REBECCA MICHEL And then finally open mindedness. So this is thinking things through, being open, being receptive to possibilities. Does that sound somewhat like you or not like you? 

00:35:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah, I was wondering could it also I was thinking when I saw the word did it mean like thinking before you act and not kind of jumping at things is that related to this? 

00:35:10
REBECCA MICHEL It's somewhat related to it I think that that actually maybe a different one somewhat related to being able to like prudence being careful about one's choices which is also if you see likes it your number eight and so that's not really jumping into things too fast. Open mindedness is it's being able to weigh all size of the situation to not just see things as black and white, to see life in the gray and somewhat to me an example is that it relates to you being able to be open minded to the fact that your friend for example while she cheated off of other people you are open minded to the fact that she is I don't think she is going to do that to me because we are close. So that's an example from one we were talking that leads me to believe you may have this strength. 

00:36:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. Okay. 

00:36:05
REBECCA MICHEL So does that, could you see the different between prudence and open mindedness. 

00:36:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I do. I do. Thank you. 

00:36:10
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. so that's those five and again you have all of these 24 to some degree or another. And so with these you said that persistence is your favorite. Alright and so let's focus on that. You know one… two of your current challenges are that with socialization with friends and then with your academics with math. And so how about do you mind if we focus on the academics right now? 

00:36:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:36:45
REBECCA MICHEL And so with that, Tina, how do you learn best, how do you usually like to learn math? 

00:36:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I have to see it and then I need to write it and then I need to write it again. 

00:36:50
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. see it, write it, write it again. 

00:36:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:36:55
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. Excellent. And your persistence strength makes you want to do really really well on the ACT right, and so you are willing to do whatever it takes, it sounds like because you have this as a strength you are very goal oriented. You are willing to take whatever it takes in order to see that outcome. That successful outcome. So one of the things that you said was that there is a couple of students in your class who are good at math but that aren't really in your social click, right? 

00:37:25
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:37:25
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. So let's think about using your strength of persistence what could you do to connect with those students in order to allow them to help you to get better at math? Let's just brainstorm what are some things that you could so? 

00:37:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Well the first thing I can do is introduce myself. 

00:37:45
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. it seems simple enough but absolutely, okay. So introduce yourself. And anything holding you back, would you anything hold you back from doing that? 

00:37:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT No, not really. 

00:37:55
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. So introduce yourself. How about, what could you say from there? 

00:38:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT people like compliments. So I can say you know I notice you are really, really good at this. I should get that way. 

00:38:05
REBECCA MICHEL Okay. so being genuine with them, right? 

00:38:05
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Yeah. 

00:38:05
REBECCA MICHEL And to people you know about people and you are naturally an encourager, right and so you notice that they are good at math and so introduce yourself, hi I am Tina, hey we are in the same math class, I notice that you are really good at this. How did that happen. Right, how what did you do, right, and so okay so and then let's say that dialog actually goes pretty well alright, we are not at a party we are in school we are in an academic setting and so what could you say from there. 

00:38:40
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I was thinking you know the teacher puts us in groups a lot, so maybe I can ask them, maybe the next time we have a group project if I could be included in the group because I am hoping like to learn from them maybe. 

00:38:50
REBECCA MICHEL And so how do you think they would respond to that, Tina? 

00:38:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Well I am trying to think if it was me I would be like okay. 

00:39:00
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. So you don't really and again that goes into probably to your open mindedness but think that you know okay somebody comes up to you, they introduce themselves, they give you compliment, they say hey can we work together and then you if somebody did that to you, you would say sure, right? 

00:39:15
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. 

00:39:15
REBECCA MICHEL So that's a great approach. Now it may not go well, right maybe you try with one of them and they say, no, I already have my group, right, so what could you do if that happens, what could you do if there is a barrier there? 

00:39:30
TINA KAMARA-LOTT If there is a barrier maybe I can approach one of the other ones. 

00:39:35
REBECCA MICHEL Okay great. That's usually a few different. 

00:39:35
TINA KAMARA-LOTT More than one… 

00:39:35
REBECCA MICHEL More than one like you said there is at least a couple so you can maybe approach them individually potentially, try that same approach, right and you could also potentially alley with your instructor with your teacher and let them know that you are really working hard to do well in the ACT and to do well in that class and that you would love to be pair list somebody who is really performing well and so there are so many different things, Tina, that you can do. This is just one example of using your strength of persistence, using your knowledge about working with people and encouraging other in order to try to get what you want with your end goal. And there is it's not always going to work out right, there is going to be some red flags that come up that it's important to pay attention to but at the end of the day if you know what you are good at and if you know what you want then you can use what you are good at your talents and your strengths in order to get what you want and we can apply this same idea to the socialization and with your peers because as we talked about before that's really, really important. 

00:40:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It is. 

00:40:45
REBECCA MICHEL And so what I like for you to do you know we are scheduled to meet again next week if you are willing to. 

00:40:50
TINA KAMARA-LOTT I am. 

00:40:50
REBECCA MICHEL But what I would like you to do is really spend some time looking through this list more and really focus on maybe even your top ten and then look at some of the ones at the bottom and pick out if there is any of them that you would like for us to help you move up, there are lots of different ways that you can move different strength up that list. 

00:41:10
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Okay. 

00:41:10
REBECCA MICHEL And then I would like you to really think about the socialization and the fact that you struggle connecting with some of your peers who have different values than you and at the end of the day, I would like you to ask yourself are those the type of people you want to be surrounding yourself with or there are other people that you can surrounding yourself with like those two friends focusing on those relationships. And either one of those are somewhere in between is fine but I would like you to look at this list, think about who do I want to be surrounding myself with as the people I call my friends. 

00:41:45
TINA KAMARA-LOTT Right. Okay. 

00:41:45
REBECCA MICHEL Then if you could bring back this assessment, these assessment results next week and then we will talk about them and keep figuring out how to help you keep living the best that you can live, Tina. 

00:41:55
TINA KAMARA-LOTT It sounds good. 

00:42:00
REBECCA MICHEL Alright. Well thanks so much for meeting today. And I will see you next week. 

00:42:00
TINA KAMARA-LOTT See you next week. 

00:42:05
HUMAN GRWOTH & DEVELOPMENT: 

00:42:05
WORKING WITH ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTS 

00:42:05
WRAP-UP 

00:42:05
with Rebecca Michel, Ph.D. 

00:42:05
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:42:10
SHANNON DERMER So thank you for demonstrating all the concepts that we talked, a lot of the concepts we talked about in the beginning in your demonstration with your mock client, that wasn't a real client so tell me what were the highlights you are trying to get across to us? 

00:42:25
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely. So first of all when working with Tina she is a very articulate and intelligent young lady as you can see and so what I first wanted to do is just to see from her what she thought some of her strengths and deficits were because often times at this developmental stage adolescence and young adults they really don't know it's they either have an inflated self-concept, or usually a really deflated self-concept or self-esteem so that helps you to just get a base line of where they are how they are thinking about themselves. And then we went into thinking about what are some challenges that she is having and these are things that we have been supposedly working on for a while so socialization with her peers, and that was mostly the conflict was mostly around the fact that her peers were doing things that she didn't really agree with morally like drinking, and partying and then the other challenge she was having was academically and since she is so goal oriented and wants to do really well when she is not doing well then that causes struggle for her. So we explored the challenges and then we went over her assessment results so that was she took the VIA youth survey and so we went over those results and I checked in with her to see if that, if she agreed with those and if she understood each of them and tried to clarify if something was confusing to her and then we used those strengths to try to tackle one of the challenges. If we would have more time I would have talked about both of those challenges and then we will keep using in future sessions I would ideally keep using that those assessment results to find other ways to use those in different areas of her life. 

00:44:15
SHANNON DERMER Good. Now I know a lot of times when we think of adolescence we think of that inflated sense of self where they are like indestructible and they are smarter than everybody else and you know those types of things but how do you use this positive approach with adolescence maybe who do have really high goals for themselves but actually have that deflated or not an accurate assessment of themselves that they actually put themselves down more than when they really at. 

00:44:45
REBECCA MICHEL Yeah and that's such a good question because often times as we know working with young adults sometimes those that present as being you know all high mighty actually have some of the lowest self-esteem. And so it's really, really important to get them one on one with you can in a group and help them to truly recognize who you are as your real self because many people specially you know, the popular groups there is quite a bit of research on this that there is actually lower self-esteem in a lot of these individuals and so if you can help people to identify and feel comfortable with who they really are their natural strengths and, and find ways to actually be that person to actually exhibit those traits, their esteem is going to actually get higher in a healthy way and one way to do this actually with people who have lower self-esteem or self-worth is to have in a group setting, to have other people say things that they have noticed about that person. So… 

00:45:50
SHANNON DERMER It's very powerful. 

00:45:50
REBECCA MICHEL It really can and you can write this down if you want to be unanimous or you can say it verbally you can do all sorts of artistic things with it but people who are struggling and when they look in the mirror they get depressed. They don't think that they have any self-worth. Hearing it from peers specially during this stage of life can be incredibly motivating because they might think okay, Shannon, you see this in me maybe I really am honest, right or maybe I really do have persistence or what not. 

00:46:20
SHANNON DERMER That's a really good point and that sometimes it's really powerful to hear something from another person specially in adolescence when they are so focused in on what other people think of them but I remember as semi-young adult when I was in my doctoral program, there is a faculty member who was my mentor, who meant a lot to me and one of the things she would do at the end of each semester when she was supervising someone is she would write them a little letter and she would write a letter you know the growth that she had seen overtime and the strengths that you had I think I might still have that letter somewhere that saying those things but I also think from a narrative perspective that idea of drawing something or having a certificate or putting something in a letter can really also reinforce what they are hearing. 

00:47:10
REBECCA MICHEL It really can and even just from developing some of those character strengths, you know, that we talked about, love for example, is such a powerful strength that really binds people together, it makes sense and so when you can actually have somebody who has lower self-esteem when they can hear what other see about them and when they can actually share what they see in other, it builds a really, really special bond between people. So I love that idea of a letter that can come from a peers, that can come from educators, from counselors, that can, and that can be really, really meaningful. 

00:47:45
SHANNON DERMER Or even parents 

00:47:45
REBECCA MICHEL Parents, absolutely parents. 

00:47:45
SHANNON DERMER Sometimes adolescence to know parents because they don't want to be told what to do or they don't think their parents are being authentic but a true authentic compliment from a parent can also do wonders. 

00:48:00
REBECCA MICHEL It can. It can and actually I have students that I have worked with who are transitioning into college or post-secondary work and momentous like that that they have they take that and they put that up in their dorm room and in the residence hall and that's what help them get through the transition. Those little things, those little messages of authenticity can be so powerful in building positive pro-social bonds. 

00:48:25
SHANNON DERMER Great. So I did see a lot of what you have talked about in the beginning you hit on in about 20 minutes or so that you hit on a lot of things, important things and I did notice the emphasis on relationships and love and lot of that that I, I am not sure every one would think to assess right away with an adolescence. 

00:48:50
REBECCA MICHEL Exactly and even as Tina asked does this mean romantic love, you know, and I think that was good because those are the types of questions that when you see these words on an assessment we have different connotations that we put on them and so it's important to talk about what the assessment and the authors of the assessments said the meaning is but then to actually find what's meaningful to them what's the definition for you and so focusing on those connections really can increase the social development among adolescence as we have talked about is so important during the stage. 

00:49:25
SHANNON DERMER It really is and I think a lot of times when we think of assessment we think of relationships we are just thinking of oh resources, resources but you keep using the word meaning and I think that that's really important to remember for everyone across the lifespan but specially for adolescences the meaning that they are getting from these relationships and the meaning they are getting from how these important people in their life see them. 

00:49:50
REBECCA MICHEL Absolutely. There is so much research out there that the involvement that parents specifically but also educators have in their youth's life has such positive impact on their development. So academically, certainly socially, emotionally there, people have better self-esteem when their parents are involved. Now of course, there is helicopter parents and there is all sorts of different things of millennium… 

00:50:15
SHANNON DERMER So involve not over-involve. 

00:50:15
REBECCA MICHEL Exactly, absolutely and it's such an important distinction but to actually be involved in a genuine way with your young adult or adolescence it's there are you can get great dividends from that. 

00:50:30
SHANNON DERMER Great. So we are just about out of time. If there is one thing you want to tell everyone to remember what is it? 

00:50:35
REBECCA MICHEL So one thing would be to focus on what's naturally a strength, what's naturally a talent in somebody rather than starting with the problem. 

00:50:50
SHANNON DERMER Great. Great. Thank you so much for that takeaway. And thank all of you for joining us today for CACREP, Essential Skills for Counseling Practice. I hope you learned about all the strengths that adolescence have and how you can use those to help your clients.
