RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and I'm your host for this series on Attachment Theory in Action. So we've been exploring all the different, the practical applications of attachment theory, a very robust research tradition that has spanned the last 50 years or so of our profession and it seems to be having increasing influence on the way that therapists actually operate in their consulting room. Our focus today is on work with children and with families and how these ideas translate into the way, the kind of relationship that the therapist forms in family therapy and working with kids. And we have with us, we're fortunate today to have someone with us who is one of the foremost practitioners of attachment based psychotherapy with kids and families, and it is my great pleasure to welcome Dan Hughes today. Hey Dan, how are you? 

00:01:15
DANIEL HUGHES Good Rich, good to see you again. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON So let's put this, our conversation in some context. Both you and I have been in the field for a while. And I must say that I, in the, in graduate school in the 1970's, I didn't hear much about attachment theory. It didn't seem like that was the prevailing influence on how therapists were supposed to be with their clients. Let's, if you could, just talk a little bit about how your, the sort of therapist your training prepared you to be, and how you got interested in attachment theory and its implications for your clinical practice. 

00:02:00
DANIEL HUGHES Oh sure, my training in the early 70's may have been similar to yours. It was fairly eclectic. The foundation was probably a combination of Carl Rogers and Cline Center therapies, as well as psychodynamic, which probably a blend of the two, with a big component, two big components coming in. One was cognitive behavioral as well as family systems, so it's probably an integration of the four and I thought it was, I thought I had a good foundation in all four, and that, that continued through my internship and in my practice. 

00:02:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:02:35
DANIEL HUGHES As you, I had little exposure to attachment. There was a bit of it in one my courses but it was seen as of interest to academic folks or maybe some theories of childhood development but it really wasn't seen as relevant to clinical applications. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Okay. And what changed? So it, so how does, you had a whole package of what were then considered the foremost models so why, why did you have to shift if, to the degree you did or, or shift your perspective any as you moved and had more experience as a practicing clinician. 

00:03:15
DANIEL HUGHES Well, failure. That was 

00:03:15
RICH SIMON That one's a big motivation in our field, isn't it? 

00:03:20
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, I decided I'm going to retire early or I was going to learn how to have more, better results. And I was getting no results with the kids and the sort of reasonable families, I was doing nice family work, I thought, with some adjustment problems and family just struggling how to, how to set combined boundaries with a relationship and maybe some stress from illness or whatever or a divorce, but I wasn't able to help other kids that I was, I was asked to develop a program for, which is kids who had been abused or neglected. There kids were presenting major problems and I wasn't able to help them. And the other kids I thought, oh I can help them but so can most people and if we don't help them, they'll probably still have a decent life, whereas I knew these kids with major problems, emotional cognitive behavioral relationship when I couldn't help them, I thought, I got to learn how to help these kids and what I was doing wasn't working. It was obvious. I wasn't going to blame the kid for it. I was going to say, I got to learn how to reach these kids. And from there, it went to, we're talking 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON So hold on for a second, Dan. So give us a little flavor, Dan, so who, who were the, how were these kids behave, what was happening? How were you, how were they, give us some flavor for the kind of therapeutic connection you were trying to create and, and what was happening or what wasn't happening with them. 

00:04:45
DANIEL HUGHES Oh sure. A variety of things, traditional oppositional things. So if I'm non-directive, it's hard when they run around the room and take things off my desk, climb my bookcase and pick up something and head toward my window with it. You know, I think the most dramatic was a kid, he was pretending or I thought he was being more cooperative today and he looked at me with big sad eyes and said, I'm thirsty. Would you get me a glass of water? And I said sure, so I went into the bathroom and I had these little paper cups hanging from a dispenser by the sink, so I pulled one down and it was filled with urine. He had peed in it and then put it up in the dispenser again. Well, he thought that was the funniest thing, I got him, you know. 

00:05:35
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. 

00:05:35
DANIEL HUGHES That realized my 

00:05:35
RICH SIMON That kind of humor has become more and more popular, if you go to the movies anymore. 

00:05:40
DANIEL HUGHES Right. Anyway, that, that, usually not as dramatic as that but these were not, were not fun to be around, you know. When I realized if I got a voicemail that one of them was sick, and I was happy about it, I realized something's wrong there. I got to find some reason to want to see these kids. And I'm starting to react to them like everyone else is, their parents or their foster parents or their teachers. I don't like them, you know, and I realize I have to change this if I'm going to help them. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:15
DANIEL HUGHES Then I start looking at attachment theory. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON So that was it. You, now this was not a, this, that would not have been an obvious decision, the obvious place to go. What made you at that point, you were just desperate. You were just picking up whatever you could or what, what made you head in the direction of attachment theory, which was at the time was thought of primarily as an academic interest? 

00:06:45
DANIEL HUGHES Well, it was, well one girl in particular really helped me when I said to her, this is your fourth foster home, and you do well for about three months and then you start doing poorly and it's happening again. Could I help you? And she said, yes I'd like some help. And I said, how can I be of help? And she said, would you help me to move every three months? So I'm sitting there thinking, what she wants is going to destroy her life, and what I want for her, which is to be able to have a good relationship with a foster parent, if she can't have it with her parents, then learn how to have it with your foster parents. And when she couldn't do that, didn't even want that, then I realized I have an uphill battle here, so then I wondered, why doesn't she want it? My kids wanted it, why doesn't she want a relationship with her foster parent? And so it just moved me into that direction. I heard a pediatrician at the time talk about, he thought that attachment was an important way to understand early childhood development, and so that probably, he helped me to, to go back to the books and try to understand, well does this have something to offer. And as soon as I started reading it, and I saw these kids described and I saw the research and the symptoms they had, the classification of attachment disorganization, it just fit the majority of every symptom I saw in these abused and neglected kids. Not everyone, but a lot of them, these kids were, had attachment disorganization. So many did, so then I realized I had to understand it better. And from there, I realized I had to learn what to do about it 'cause as you say, it was good, I mean it had good academic and it has some nice early descriptions of the symptoms of these kids. But it didn't have nearly enough of what to do about it. 

00:08:40
RICH SIMON There was no instruction manual about attachment theory, yea. 

00:08:45
DANIEL HUGHES These were all developmental academic psychologists there or others to them. They weren't clinicians. 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON So how do you begin to do that? How do you begin to take very interesting research literature, all kinds of interesting findings, but by people who are not primarily concerned with the idea of changing behavior. They're looking at development of behavior over time. How does, how did you begin to develop what became this framework that you've been, continues to develop over these last 30 years or so? 

00:09:20
DANIEL HUGHES Well, I had the book and I'm sitting at home reading the book, and I have three little kids running around. That helped. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON You had a laboratory. 

00:09:30
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, I really did. And they, they joke with me now, but they're glad I learned because I needed some work to be a better father, and I'm still learning so that's an lovely, another lovely thing about attachment, that it never stops, so you can develop relationships with your kids when they're adults. And then, when you're an old person, they, you attach to them, so what come there goes around. But you got to get it right. 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON Cycle of life. Yep, yep. 

00:10:00
DANIEL HUGHES Anyway, so there was that. I was experimenting there, there were a few programs or groups of therapist who said they were using attachment model, so I went and talked to them and saw what they did. I liked some bits but I didn't like other bits. They had ideas of parenting so I started considering those. So they, I think the main benefit I got from them is they were outside the box, and I realized I may not like what they're doing outside the box, but maybe I need to go outside the box a little bit too. And I also had a blend of the non-directive, Carl Rogers and all, and the dynamic to some extent, and the directive of the CBT clubs and the training I got there and I realized why can't I combine the two. Why do I have to be one or the other? And then I at the time was increasingly seeing clear that Carl Rogers was becoming more directive, less non-directive. He was still client-centered, but he seemed to be stretching so maybe we could stretch. Then I realized as a parent, I wasn't non-directive and I wasn't directive. I was both. So why not have a relationship that cod integrate both, and I kind of, I call it, follow lead follow. Follow the person like you do with a baby. When they get stuck or when they're doing things not in the best interest, I lead them out of it or I lead them into looking at traumas or shameful events, and then I follow their response to my lead, and then I lead them again, and I follow them. It's a back and forth, just like it is, it's a very reciprocal process like it is with a parent child. It's reciprocal. 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON So let's, let's jump ahead here a little bit and talk about now, today, how you've integrated this and if you're, let's give people some of the basic principles that organize what you do and also how the connection between what you do and these principles. So with attachment theory, therapy in general, but particularly, this issue of safety is in many therapists minds, the initial and perhaps the foremost issue of creating a relationship in the therapy room. Safety I think is in the forefront of your work. Talk to us about the role safety plays, why it's important and what is there distinctive about the way you think about creating an atmosphere of safety in the relationship with the client from the very first session. 

00:12:30
DANIEL HUGHES Ok sure. Well, if I'm studying attachment, then I'm going to read about safety all the time since it's the, that's the foundation of attachment theory. And then as a therapist, as you say, most therapies agree on the need for safety especially therapies that are dealing with trauma. We have to have safety. So, it just became a given, I have to facilitate safety, and then I'm thinking some of the behavior of these kids when they're running around the room or they're swearing at me is probably they're not safe. So how do I facilitate safety. Well, first I realize I had to be more of a person to them, so I'm not going to be ambiguous, 'cause ambiguity generates a bit of anxiety. Freud knew that, he even talked about the value of ambiguity, so that people become mildly anxious so they reassociate better. So I'm thinking I don't want ambiguity, I want to be, I want clarity. Parents are very clear about their experience with their kids that they have, and they communicate it very openly and directly so I want to do that. But what do I focus on if I'm communicating my, what experience do I want to have, and I realized that I can't focus on their symptoms because I'm not going to like their symptoms. Then, you know, that's not going to help them be safe if I start yelling at them for what they're doing, but I have to focus on what's under the symptoms and discover what that is because it's probably things dealing with shame and anxiety, fear, sadness, and a lack of trust, and if I focus on that, it's easy to have empathy with them. It's easy to like them. So I started to set it, not that I won't address the symptoms if I have to for safety. If he's going to punch me or jump out the window, I would address that. But if I don't have to worry about physical safety, I could quickly set them aside a bit and then wonder about them or have empathy about them or just accept that whatever their motive it, it's probably coming from survival. Kids who feel, see it's the only way I can sort of get by. So I start doing that, and I was very clear about it that I was interested in them, in, in the kid. And my interest was usually in the here and now. What he's wearing, his attitude, something that he says, how he's doing his hair today, something he told me last week that I wrote down so I wouldn't forget it. Again attachment is about you don't forget a person when they're out of sight. You know, a kid knows when they go to school, their parents don't forget them, and they will come back home at night and the home will be there and you know, so when I take notes after a session, my first thing, number one note, is something the kid has told me that I cannot forget. So I can bring it up in the next session, and I can ask him about it, or if he tells me about it, I won't have a blank look on my face. That's going to undermine safety, that I've clearly no interest in this human being. I might be interested in his problems or his symptoms but not the person. So I have to, I have to remember what he tells me and get excited about it, get interested in it. I remember, oh I was so proud one day. I knew I had made when this girl comes in, this teenage girl, she's coming in with her usual somewhat strange outfit and this time she had this greenish weird looking green purse. And I said, hey you got an interesting green purse there. And she said, oh yea, whatever. And I said, but it's not the purse you had last week, do you have more than one purse? She looked at me like I was clueless and I said... so we had a great discussion on why she has seven purses, and the different colors and textures and sizes and what she uses them for, and I was truly interested in why teenage girls have seven purses. I was so proud of myself. 

00:16:20
RICH SIMON Yea, good for you. 

00:16:20
DANIEL HUGHES I wasn't faking it. I wasn't faking it. 

00:16:25
RICH SIMON Yea 

00:16:25
DANIEL HUGHES So you know, when a kid, a boy came in and tells me about a football team, that was easy to be interested in it. But it wasn't easy to get interested in the purses. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON Expanding your range. 

00:16:35
DANIEL HUGHES I have to be interested in anything I ask her about or tell her, or she tells me. Anything. 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON So Dan, as staying on the subject of safety for the moment, the, tell us a little bit, so how does this sound in a first session? What are the kinds of things that you're saying as you're getting to know a kid and you're beginning to create that initial bond with him or her? 

00:17:00
DANIEL HUGHES Well, it's, before I say what I say, it's how I say it. It's a very relaxed conversational tone, you know it's like a story teller. It's not monotone, it's not lecturing, it's not sort of a factual fact gathering thing. It's not sitting back and writing notes about a person. It's engaging them in a story about their life, so the tone is, hey look at that. Wait a second, wait a second. I didn't notice this before, was that green stripe over your right ear, was that there last week? If so, I'm really sorry cause it's fascinating. Why green and why there? And I lean over and if he'll let me, I'll touch the green stripe and I'll be interested in it. I might ask him if he thinks that will look on me. You know, should I do it? Could I get away with it? Or maybe a different color stripe. And would he laugh at me if I came in next week with an orange, an orange stripe over my right ear, or would other people? You know, I'm going to talk about silly things. I'm going to be somewhat, a bit foolish. I'll be safe because I won't be a real serious person who's going to fix the kid. What I'm communicating is I'm interested in you. My goal, my intention, and this is the heart of relationships, we feel safe with a person when we know their intention and we like their intention. Their intention is complimentary to our intention. So suppose I sit down and I say to a kid, nonverbally or verbally, by my tone or my content, okay my intention is to fix you. Kids don't sign up for that usually. You know, they throw you away. So my intention is just to get to know you, have a bit of fun, and just be curious about your life and these kids are lonely. Nobody knows them nobody takes much time to get to know them, and my attitude usually stuns them. That it's, it is very safe. There's no strings attached here, I just want to get to know you. And I'm also confident as I get to know the kid, truly get to know him, the symptoms will make sense in their story. And, and when I wonder about those, they'll be open to change if they need to change and they'll be, I don't have to fix them. They'll just take care of themselves I help the kid get a coherent story. But getting back to the safety part, it's that I'm, easy for them to read me, very clear nonverbally of my experience and my experiences tend to start right where they are comfortable starting. And I follow their rea-, I'm not real animated and silly with a kid who comes in who's angry and depressed. That would be disrespectful. The kid who comes in angry, I start noticing that. I say hey, I say, I notice you're kind of angry. Is that about me or something else? Could you help me understand it? I'll be more serious but not in a lecturing fact gathering. It's still conversationable tone, but it's a different emotional affective state. This isn't laughing or being playful cause he's not in that position, so I follow what he's presenting to me. 

00:20:05
RICH SIMON Okay, and so by the end, is, is you view of a, in a first session, is there, it's not like there's a lot you're trying to accomplish outside this process that you've been bringing to life for us, with your, you know, I get the flavor of what it might be like to sit in a first session with you. In, in, so there's not a, you might go through a whole first session and not talk about there's a problem in this kid's life. How does the, what's the relationship between this kind of immediate response and this quality that you're generating and the connection with the kid and any attempt to address why that kid happens to be there. 

00:20:50
DANIEL HUGHES Well, the, my goal is to connect with the kid, to get a connection going with a kid who isn't very good at connections or don't, doesn't want them, doesn't trust them. SO that's my overriding intention in the first session. However, by the end of the session I want, I also want him to know, to have a bit of an experience that there's nothing that he's not safe exploring with me. Nothing. So I'm not going to avoid hard stuff in the first session, I want to give him a taste that hard stuff is part of who he is and part of life, and he's safe to explore that with me too, cause my attitude about that won't change. When I ask him about the thing over his hair or whatever, and I ask him about, hey I hear, I hear you had a hard time yesterday cause you stole something from your mom and she caught you. Boy you and her were kind of angry with each other. Was that hard? What was going on there anyway? So my attitude is still the same about his stealing from his mother as it was about the green stripe in his hair. And he says, I don't want to talk about it. Oh okay. He says, yea, you don't know me very well. Well, we can talk about it another time. I felt sad about it because you had a really hard day yesterday, and you know, it sounds like you and your mom aren't feeling close right now. So if, you know, if you change your mind just let me know. So he, he may not talk about the stealing in that session, but he gets the idea. Therapy is about everything about him. I don't as a narrative therapist say, I don't privilege only the easy stuff 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Yea, yea 

00:22:15
DANIEL HUGHES I privilege everything about this child. I'm as interested in his stealing as I am in the green hair and his purse or whatever. So I want to give him a bit of that in the first session. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Okay, so, so this, in addition to this, this, the encompassing, this holding environment if you will, of safety, there's also that, there's that other element of the new leanings, of exploration. 

00:22:45
DANIEL HUGHES Yes 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON So talk to us about that. What's, you want to start by creating the kind of atmosphere you've been describing. And then, new learnings, adventure, exploration. What's the role of that, that side of, that quality of relationship in what you're trying to do? 

00:23:05
DANIEL HUGHES Okay, it's part of the same thing. I just focus in on it from a slightly different perspective. And that's where attachment is going to, the theory of attachment started with safety, but now there's some attachment therapists are stretching it into they're safe to explore, and you're safe with your parent, but then you're safe to explore the world, and the exploration, how do you explore the world when you're a baby? It's through your parent's eyes and through their experience of you. And that's how it has to fit into their subjectivity. Well some people would say it's part of attachment, other people say it's a separate innate motivating factor. I don't care. It really doesn't matter to me, they're just so interwoven that as I facilitate safety, I'm showing, in our connection, they're also experiencing events in the world, and their experience of the world and mine, through my experience. And I'm an adult. Kids tend to be, when they're safe with an adult, to be more open to be influenced by the adult, and to go with the adult in exploring something, no matter what it is. So I start to explore things with the kid, and I chat about it, wonder about it, to see if they have any ideas about it. We might get a camera, I get out my cell phone after I learned how to use it and take a picture of a bird out the window and I look it up on the internet with the kid and you know, what kind of a bird is that? And I tell them I'll research it for them in the next week, and so I explore the world. If I get excited about this, he will get excited about it. He might laugh about it, so anyway, the new learning is in part through my safe exploration of things in the world with him. Just like babies do. They learn through the parent's experience. Well, these kids who have had nothing but negative experiences and no adults to identify with, be close to, communicate with, I want to be an active influence, a participant in his developing an awareness of his world. Well, most of the focus is his world not mine. You know I'm not going to sit and talk about my interests unless it overlaps his interest. But I'll be deeply interested and developing interest in his world. 

00:25:15
RICH SIMON So tell us about, how that sounds, Dan. So what, what are the kinds of ways in which you set the stage for that, and make it clear, clear that the kid can talk about the, what his interests are or if he wishes to, talk about what disturbing and that he can, that that's also, that it's a place where he can talk about that, possibly some other way of handling things. Just how, how is that you, again what does that sound like and what's the kind of things, give us some flavor of, of the back and forth with these kids that you see. 

00:25:50
DANIEL HUGHES Well, I usually don't ask kids as much as I just sort of know about them, so I'll be talking to the parents before I meet the kid. What are his interests, what's he do, how does he spend his free time, what are you know things he's fascinated with or you know, that sort of thing. So when I sit down with a kid, I say hey, hey I hear you like the Philadelphia Eagles. Yea, I do too. What do you think about Michael Vic, I heard he got hurt again, ain't that a bummer. So, what, you know whatever he's interested in, I, I will, I'll know about it and I'll start asking him, wondering about it, and I'll be genuine about it. When we're focused on that, I'm fully focused on that, fully present. And then I'll move from that to something else and then I'll say, so you know my guess is sometimes you're interested in other things. In fact, I heard, your mom said you really, you really enjoy at night just sort of going up to your room and reading. And, it's that Harry Potter series, I heard? You know, fascinating isn't it? So what was, what are some of the characters you're most excited about Harry Potter? You know, I don't know. So it depends on the kid, and they give me feedback constantly, about do they want to talk about it or not, and then I wonder about, say it's a foster kid and I'll just sort of gently [00:27:105]say, hey I hear this is your second foster home. What's that like, you know, and I never, I never had that. I grew up in one home. I don't know what that's like. It's almost like moving into the home of strangers, right? Like a house of strangers. I think that would be kind of hard. How do you handle that the first few days or the first few weeks? Are you kind of nervous, kind of just, do you find you just sort of hang out in your bedroom more, or do you talk about little things, you just sort of get to know them one bit at a, what do you do about that? So I'm interested in, now this is a little trickier 'cause there's probably going to be some anxiety there, and it won't be something he's ashamed of or probably terrified of but it moves him into areas that are a little harder to talk about. And he's going to see my attitude about that is the same way. I'm not judging it, I'm telling him what he should do, I'm not correcting him. I'm just curious about it. I have empathy about it, and I wonder about it and I accept it whatever he's telling me. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON Yea. 

00:28:05
DANIEL HUGHES So, that would develop and as time goes on, and it may be later in the session, in the next session, but I know this kid's story has big gaps in it, or parts that are not regulated well, parts that are just split off, so he's not, he's fragmented really, his psyche. So I know I have to address those 'cause I also know if I sit and wait for him to bring it up, I'll wait years and he won't bring it up. So I would generally go over and say, hey, you know we've chatted for two or three weeks now and you haven't told me about those hard times you used to have with your dad. And I read about it from the social worker, and your foster mom told me that you mentioned something to her about it. Could you help me understand what was, what would you say is one of the hardest things that happened with you and your dad? Could you, could you let me know that, just a bit of it, just you decide how much and what. You know, I just want to know how you handled it, and how that's affected your life now. So my voice is now much more gentle and empathic or compassionate, so the kid feels usually safe with me in doing that. But, but I want to stress this, Rich, that, that the greatest amount of success comes from the fact that I have not changed my conversational tone. This is really important from my point of view. So many therapists do a relationship building thing where they're conversational and relaxed and then they change their tone and get very serious and sober. 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. 

00:29:40
DANIEL HUGHES And get that monotone, and they almost say, well, that was fun. Now we got to talk about you know, why you're here, which is you know, the problems with aggression due to being abused by your dad. And the tone changes the entire, there's no momentum. It's like all this relationship building, the value of it, this about relationship building, it comes to a stop, so it was wasted and then you start over again with a serious tone, whereas I flow from one to the other. The content is different but my attitude through my conversational tone stays the same. 

00:30:15
RICH SIMON Oh. That seems very important. Yea, yea. 

00:30:20
DANIEL HUGHES Cause you got the momentum and the kid, if you don't lose that momentum, the kids often answer before they're aware of answering. Because the narrative, the story telling quality creates its own, own life, like its own movements and the kids just feel safe and they just join it with this new content. 

00:30:40
RICH SIMON So this, this, so what are your, at this aspect of things, you've laid a foundation with, for this connection that you have with the kid and then so most, many of the kids coming in, there's some trauma narrative in there somewhere in your particular practice and so one of the principles I know that's important is this idea that the story comes alive. So part of it, helping the story to come alive, is to not make it so serious and somber and begin to talk in our therapy speak fashion. But beyond that, say more about the importance of the story coming alive and why that is, is something that you, you like to talk about in regard to your work with kids. 

00:31:25
DANIEL HUGHES Oh sure. Well, again if we go to attachment theory and we hear that a securely attached adolescent or adult has a coherent autobiographical narrative, the story is coherent, it's safe, it's comprehensive, there's no big gaps and distortions, it's consistent, it just is a, it's a story that hangs together. The events of a person's life make sense in the, in the context of their overall life story. Well, that, that's the theory so the question is how to get that to happen in therapy in the conversational tone, the story telling tone I find to be the best way to get that to happen. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON Interesting. 

00:32:10
DANIEL HUGHES Right, and if you read Steven Porges and his polyvagal theory, and he talks about acceptance and he talks about the ventralvagal circuit, he uses story telling tone. And he talks about the need for modulations and rhythms in your voice if you want the other person to be open and engaged with you. So it just, it's consistent with the neurological research. It's consistent with the attachment research, and it's what we know that story tellers hold the attention. Story tellers have influenced people for 10,000 years at least, probably in a time, the amount of time we've influenced people by giving them a lecture is very small. 

00:32:55
RICH SIMON Yea, yea, that's sort of, that's a new twist in, in human evolution. Now one of things that you, that you seem to emphasize that fits with this whole style that you've been demonstrating for us really, is the idea that you somehow are part of the story. Now what does that mean? 

00:33:15
DANIEL HUGHES Oh sure am. It's affecting me. The story, say this kid is talking about being abused by his dad, well I'm putting my mind there. This 5 year old boy, now he's 7 say, and he's able to re-, he's able to be safe enough to reflect with me on some of the acts that his father did to him. And as he's telling me this story and I hear the fear in his voice, and he's trembling and he's sad, or his anger or whatever, and I'm with him in it. I'm experiencing it with him. I'm being a 5 year old boy and I'm, I'm stunned that my father would do this to me. I'm imagining what it would be like to be a 5 year old boy whose father is supposed to be the source of safety is a source of terror. And so then my voice and my face show it. I'm not condemning the father, I'm not telling the boy how he should respond to that or react to that, but I'm experiencing whatever he's experiencing about that and as I do, he speaks more and more openly about it 'cause I'm with him. And my affective response which is matched with or tuned with or resonating with, whatever you want to call it, his emotions about that, helps this boy to stay regulated emotionally while he's telling the story 'cause he's experiencing, psychologically I'm holding his hand. I'm with him experiencing it with him. I'm not standing back observing it. I'm as close as I can be physically to him safely, probably it, cause I do, generally I do this work in a family setting. Helping kids to resolve trauma, I want the parents there if they're sources of safety. The parent probably will have their arm around the child while he's crying and shaking about his father abusing him. And fairly quickly into the story, if I really allow myself to experience with it, there's going to be tears in my eyes. I'll be there, I, I'm, they're always there, well not always. If they're not there, I'm surprised, why aren't they there? I'm with a 5 year old boy being abused by his father, Why don't I have tears in my eyes for the pain of this boy? And then he sees it on my face and hears it in my voice, and then what he's getting from me is a couple things. So one as I say, he can regulate the emotion, it's not dis-regulating because I'm with him in it, as is the career or the parent who has her arm around him, but the second thing is he's getting my experience of his father abusing him, and he sees I'm stunned. I can't understand how a father would do that. I have deep empathy for a boy feeling betrayed. He's experiencing that abuse in a new way. Not the way his father experienced it, which is, you deserve this you bad boy, but the way I'm experiencing it so there's new meaning developing from that event. 

00:36:10
RICH SIMON And Dan, so what, how, what are the kinds of things that you might be saying at that moment in working with this, this 5 year old for example? 

00:36:15
DANIEL HUGHES Well, I'd be saying things like, oh my goodness, my goodness, how hard that must have been. You were a little fellow. And my guess is you often wanted to be with your dad and you often said, Dad, Dad, I'm trying to be a good boy, please don't hurt me, don't hurt me, and he hurt you anyway. You say, what am I doing wrong, you, part of it's like am I a bad boy? Does my dad not li-, I don't know, probably all kinds of questions like why would he do this, and how scary would that be, very scary. Yea, I don't know, what did you do with that? What did you do? Was there somebody there you could go to, or the times you could find a way to get your dad stopping to hit you, or what? So it's, it's a urgency to understand, it's a 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON That's a great phrase, yea, there is a quality of urgency in how you're saying that isn't there? 

00:37:05
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, really it is. 

00:37:05
RICH SIMON It's important that we 

00:37:05
DANIEL HUGHES It really is, I'm not just trying to 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON that we understand this together, yea 

00:37:10
DANIEL HUGHES this kid, I'm participating with him in developing the story about that abusive event. If he can make a story and stay regulated and get the shame out of it and get the terror out of it, it will be integrated into his life story, and that's my goal, so that doesn't mean he would deny it or distort it or dwell on it. It means that down the road, if something comes up and reminds him of that or thinks of his dad or, he will be able to sit there and maybe be sad or a little afraid but he won't disregualte. He won't be in shame and terror about that. 

00:37:45
RICH SIMON And you're, in a way you've become part of a story, haven't you, by, by enabling him to be able to relive it with you as it, you're really alongside him. 

00:37:55
DANIEL HUGHES I really am. 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON Yea, yea, yea. 

00:38:00
DANIEL HUGHES And by being that, I can give my adult meaning and my therapist meaning and my good father meaning. I could be stunned a father would do that. 

00:38:10
RICH SIMON Yea, yes. You're not trying to change his story but you're adding a dimension to what happened to him that wasn't there the first time around. So he has his experience then he has your experience and something was terribly out of joint with that and your, your empathy and your wish that it hadn't happened and your, and mainly in the way that you're describing it, your, your desire to really understand. 

00:38:35
DANIEL HUGHES Understand, be with him in it, and tremendous compassion for a child who experienced that. So yea, there's new meanings that will emerge from that because I'm with him. I'm participating with him in it. 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON Now let's add one other element here because that, all of this, seems very important and you're doing, you just don't see these kids by themselves through therapy. They, working with the kid individually sounds like it's a piece of what you do. But wherever possible, you're trying to involve the parents. So to begin with, how do you think about this? What's, when are you seeing the child just you and the child, and when are the parents being involved, and then how, how are you developing a relationship with the parents in some ways as parallel to the kind of sense of safety qualities you're describing in your model with the kid. 

00:39:30
DANIEL HUGHES Right, well, I started, I developed this model with abused kids in foster and adoptive homes and now I use it with all families. So it's a model of family therapy rather than a just a model of working with abused kids in foster and adoptive homes. And so, that's my default position. If I can help this kid to be in a home where he or she is developing secure attachment with his or her parents, it's much more powerful an intervention than doing some individual work an hour a week, 'cause he has parents there and if they could facilitate attachment, I mean there, there's the people with p9ower to do it, much more than I do. So the goal is then family work. So if I have parents who are willing to do that, when they refer the kid, I say great, you know, come on in, I'll meet you guys first. Don't bring your kid, I just want to meet you and get to know the kid, and get to know you. Well, my goal, I call it a 2-phase type of family therapy, where I'm working with the parents alone first, and that may be one session, it may be ten sessions. I'm going to work with the parents until number one, they feel safe with me. I'm not blaming them, I'm not judging them, I'm not saying they're bad people. In fact, I got to experience the parents way of experiencing the kid. These are good people. What's under their symptoms? So they're punitive, and harsh, and cruel, and say mean things to the kid. Okay, but why, why are they doing that? You know, my guess is it comes from their shame and their fear and their not knowing what else to do. You know, they're reliving the way they were treated. So I have to help them to be safe with me, and then once they're safe with me, and they're open to, to seeing that I want them to have a better relationship with their kid, 'cause the kid needs them not me, I'm not going to stand in the way of that or compete with them. I want to facilitate that. I say to parents all the time, I'm a midwife to this process, to give a psychological rebirth to your relationship with your kid. You know, so it's like they, like you had when they were an infant or you know whatever. So then, so then I look with the parents about where their experience with their kid is, have they lost the sight of the beauty of their child, what's under the symptoms, are they now in what, um, a good friend and I wrote a book called Friend-Based Parenting. We called it block care. The parents have sort of run out of energy, they don't like their kid anymore, and they don't see anything good about their kid. This is not good, and if the kid is living in a home with parents that don't like him and don't see anything good about them, it's going to be very hard to change this kid. And I'm not going to start family therapy if they can come in and they say, what a little crappy kid I got here. You know, they're showing that in their behavior and their attitude and what they're saying. The attitude's horrible. I don't see that as therapeutic. I really don't. So I want the parents to, to get it at the beginning, they're not close to their kid and I have empathy for them. So when some of the best sessions occur after when I see the kid with the parent, the session after, the parent looked at me and said I hate my kid, because they're safe to tell me that. And in telling me that, they usually start to cry, and then they get it that I understand how painful it must be to hate your kid. And then they look at me and say, I don't want to hate my kid. I really love him, but I lost the love. How can I get it back? So those are really powerful sessions I have with parents alone first, 'cause they're safe with me that I'm not judging them, I'm not looking to them as the cause of their kid's problems. I'm looking at their relationship with their kid. If we can get it healthy and moving in an attachment based way, that's the best solution to their kid's problems, whatever the cause. So that, anyway that's the first phase. I get the parents so they're safe with me, we explore, and I may look at their own attachment history about you know, if they know they react when a kid gets angry because if they ever got angry, their parents would have slapped them and angered. They just never knew how to handle anger in a family, or whatever. Or they were never close to their dad and now they're not close to their son and they, you know, they're in the shame of that, or they wanted to do it. Those types of things. So we've addressed that they're safe, we're exploring it, I talk about how we're going to do the session. I talk about let me take the lead, let me help your kid to be a bit vulnerable and open about what's hard. Believe me, if he says my parents don't love me, I'm not going to take it as, on fact, or if they say my parents never spend any time with me, you don't have to defend yourself on that. I will say, if that's your experience, kiddo, that must be hard. If they, if the kid says, my parents, I'm not important to them anymore, one kid said I'm only an investment to my dad. And then the dad found that hard to hear but he was able to sit and listen to his kid saying that, when I helped the kid to tell me his experience of that, and how he came to that conclusion that he's nothing but his investment to his dad, and how sad he is that he's not more based on his experience, and he wants to be more. Well this dad, when the boy turned to him, 'cause I said why don't you tell your dad that. And the kid says tell him what. Tell him Dad, sometimes I don't feel very special to you other than as an investment. Well the boy is starting cry when he tells his dad that. His dad is starting to cry when he answers him, and since I told dad I'm going to have dialogues like this and I've coached him a little bit, and I let him know I'll sort of remind if he forgets, I'll nudge him, Dad's going to start with empathy. Dad's going to say something like, 'cause we will have practiced this in my sessions alone, I'll let the parents know, if you want a relationship, you got to start with empathy about his experience rather than arguing with him or reassuring him. Start with empathy. So dad will say something like, son, I'm really sorry. If you experience, if you believe that you're nothing but an investment to me, I can see where you really don't feel close to me or safe with me. I'm sorry I haven't been able to show how special you are to me in a thousand other ways. I have to learn how to do that, don't I? I want to learn. Dad will say something like that and mean it, instead of yelling at his kid, what do you mean an investment? yea, well, you know, I am investing a lot in you, and da da da, you don't show me any gratitude. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON We're off to the races. 

00:46:05
DANIEL HUGHES Yea. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON Part of, so a big part of the flavor of your work as we're talking is that the parents have seen how you do what you've been showing us, that you do with their child. And they either, they're aware of it or consciously, I would imagine a lot of that rubs off on them and how they talk. 

00:46:30
DANIEL HUGHES Right. It really does. You know, this attitude, I call it the attitude of PACE, being playful, accepting, curious and empathic 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON Say that one again. That acronym I know that was very important. 

00:46:40
DANIEL HUGHES Sorry, I was being a little fast there. Playful, accepting, curious and empathic. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON Empathic 

00:46:45
DANIEL HUGHES If I have those four qualities in 90% of my interactions with kids in therapy, most kids start to respond to it. They soak it up. And I talk to parents about it. It's in my books for parents, being playful, accepting, curious and empathic. And when parents see how to do that without problem solving, without quick reassurance or lecturing, and they see the value of connecting to their kids that way, and how the kids respond to it, it takes practice but parents fairly quickly get it. One of my favorite stories, this guy comes in and I'm telling him about this. He's a construction worker type fellow, I think he did, ran a construction company. He looked at me and said, hey doc, I don't know if you noticed, I'm not Mr. Rogers. And I said, well actually I did notice, but my guess is you like results, right? You can say that again, that's the bottom line. Well, my guess is if you tried this for two weeks, you'll see some results and you don't have to be Mr. Rogers to do it. Tell me again doc, what I'm supposed to do. I'm willing to try for two weeks. He came in two weeks later so proud of himself. He says the kids don't argue with me as nearly as much. They listened to me, I listened to them. I guess I never listened to them before, did I? Well, probably not enough. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Yea. 

00:48:15
DANIEL HUGHES Anyway, so I, I really, some people worry I'm too directive with parents. Like one, one more traditional family therapists says, you're infantilizing the parent. And I say I'm empowering the parent. I'm giving them skills, I'm teaching them skills, not, I'm not doing it in a problem solving way. I'm just saying if you relate to your kids this way, they will respond to you. 

00:48:35
RICH SIMON What was the, focus on that for a moment. So where, I kind of, where does that coming from? So what's so directive about what you've been, I don't, I don't personally get that from what you're saying so far, but what is that, what is that, what are you doing that seems so directive. 

00:48:50
DANIEL HUGHES Well, well like I might say to the parent, like the investment kid, I might say to the parent, if you're kid says to you at some point, when you say no to me, I think you're doing it just 'cause you don't like me or 'cause what I want isn't important, if he says something like that to you, because that's what's emerging in the story, well you respond with empathy first. And then I tell him how to do it. How, give him examples, and I say if you give him, if you argue with him or give him your experience, you know, or reassure him, it, he won't feel heard. He needs to feel heard first, and then give him some reassurance or even better, just let him know you're going to work with him to help him experience things he doesn't experience from you right now. You know, things like that. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON So it's like, is it when it fit in, it sounds like part of the way you see your role is your, amongst other things, you're a model but you're also a coach. 

00:49:45
DANIEL HUGHES Oh yea right. 

00:49:50
RICH SIMON A big part of what you're doing is you're trying to coach parents and maybe, at the appropriate moment, kids to respond in different ways. 

00:49:55
DANIEL HUGHES Oh for sure. Yea, yea that's a big part of what I do, so there is a directive component, but I don't feel, I don't think parents feel infantilized. I find them feeling empowered to, I can do this. And I can do, my kid responds to me, not just to this therapist. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. Now what is it, so we're talking about kids and it's, it's very poignant to hear how you how you talk with five year olds and small children. So in your practice, are we moving through, how does the model that you're laying out for us change as we move in, kids move into their teenage years? What does change about it? 

00:50:40
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, well, I think we just trust your, trust your, um, your parts of your brain that are not real conscious and just relate to a teenager like they're teenagers. And so the tone is a little different but it's still a story telling tone. It's not quite as playful and you know, like exuberant and, or they'll look at you and 

00:50:55
RICH SIMON Oh they'll, they'll just go, be gone to you, I don't want to talk to Mr. Rogers myself and 

00:51:05
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, yea. But it's still deeply interested, deeply wondering, and I'm with teenagers the way I am with their parents in a way, which is I search for things that they're annoyed with me about, that they don't like about what I said in this, and I'm really searching constantly for nonverbal expressions and that's the main communication I'm looking at. I'm really attuned to their nonverbal expressions so when the teenager breathes differently or sighs or rolls his eyes or looks out the window, there you go, I would say to the teenager, my guess is something I just said really doesn't resonate with you. You really don't feel any value in it. Help me understand, what did I say that you didn't like? So I invite teenagers to disagree with me and to express their experience of me, or what I said or the whole therapy process. Teenagers love that, they feel so respected or heard. I'm not, I'm not an expert who knows best for them or I'm not, you know, I'm a person like they are, and when they disagree or when they're bored or when they don't understand, I notice their nonverbal and invite it, which means they don't have to sit there and agree with me. They just be whoever they are and so I'm teaching them how to use words to express all the nonverbal expressions they're using. They have a choice. They could, they could put it into words and I'll get it quicker. Or they could keep using the nonverbal and I'll keep wondering about it. Also I sweat with teenagers. When they, you know, when they dis me, when they disrespect me, when they devalue me and stuff like that, I whine about it. I, I get somewhat irate about it, not, in a playful way usually a light way. Hold on there, hold on there kiddo. Why are you treating me like this? Well just because I'm a hell of a lot older than you, and I have all these wrinkles and gray hair and I know nothing about texting, doesn't mean I can't add something to your life. 

00:53:00
RICH SIMON Not a complete moron, yea. Okay. 

00:53:05
DANIEL HUGHES Yea, and then they give me a hard time about this and that, and I say, no no no no, that's not fair, you don't know me. Maybe other therapists are that way but I'm different. How do you feel if I say you're just like every adolescent you ever met? You say, no I'm different. I'm a unique person. Well so am I, I'm a unique therapist, so cut it out. Treat me, you know, don't treat me that way, you know. So I whine with adolescents and they like that. Keep talking, if I get animated and sweat and let an adolescent know, I'm really struggling here trying to get to know parts of you and you're saying you don't want me to know. Help me understand, why don't you want me to know this? If you don't want me to know 'cause you think I'll judge you or try to tell you what to do or try to fix you, I sure buy that. I'm glad you're saying I'm not going to tell you about that. But I don't think you know me well enough to know yet that I don't do stuff like that. Why don't you give me a pass, just a tiny, so I'm, it's still story telling voice with teenagers. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Yea, yea but there's no veneer. There's no, of the calm, loft, lofty wisdom delivered from on there. 

00:54:15
DANIEL HUGHES I just 

00:54:15
RICH SIMON It's never going to come out at you, yea. 

00:54:20
DANIEL HUGHES I like to mix it up a bit with teenagers. They respect that more that we disagree about this. I'm pushing, sweating, they want to know I'm willing to work for a relationship, when they make it hard to have a relationship. I'm not just sitting there collecting my money and if they're too hard, I'll refer them to somebody else. 

00:54:40
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. So what, when you, you, from just this brief sample, you, you, you are a pretty damn engaging person across this, with the kids and across their different developmental stages with the parents. What do, at this stage, you been doing this for a while now, you're, what's, what are the cases that you find, given everything you've been explaining to us, about what you've developed over the years, what's, what are the toughest kinds of cases for you personally at this stage of your development as a psychotherapist? 

00:55:20
DANIEL HUGHES Toughest to be able to help, or toughest 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON To help them, yea 

00:55:25
DANIEL HUGHES Well, oh, well the toughest for me are the ones I can't help. I'm not able, I'm not successful with. The types of kids or situations I'm least successful with, if I'm working with a family and I can't get the parents to buy into it, they drop out, they get furious, they refuse to do anything, they constantly you know, I, I can't reach the parents and then they drop out. The kids too have had multiple traumas. The repetition of trauma is so damaging. The more you have the harder it is geometrically I think. Some of those kids I'm not able to reach. Some kids who have had such horrific beginnings and especially neglect and orphanage experiences, I'm not sure. They sort of like have a hole at the bottom of the bucket and I think I'm getting there but then it's, start all over again the next week or the next month and, and I don't know, you know I don't want to blame them and I don't want to say they're not helpable or not reachable, but what I am doing isn't reaching them. I know that, and I feel very sad about that, 'cause I just keep looking for how do I connect to this kid, how to help this one. And without coming to any conclusions that he can't be helped. So then I have to refer to someone else that I might respect or that might have a somewhat different approach and, or different situation or whatever, and hope that they could reach them when I wasn't able to. 

00:56:55
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. So we just have a few minutes now, and in a moment I think people would be interested in finding out some of the resources and things. Last thing, so, so people who are interested and perhaps their style of work might be very different than yours. If your, if you were to give some initial, some suggestion about what's, to move in the direction of what you're talking about, maybe part of what you described is, is something that they might want to adapt, maybe they have some questions about others, where's the beginning? What, what is it, what would your advice be to somebody who's listening to this and this, and what you're describing is kind of a brand new ball game and they're just trying to get their feet wet here, move in a different therapeutic direction in terms of their own style, what would, what advice would you give to a therapist such as that? 

00:57:50
DANIEL HUGHES To really be committed to a therapeutic relationship, that has a strong reciprocal quality to it, where you're impacted by, intersubjectivity means you're both, the subjective experience of both is affected. So believe in that, trust it. Secondly is that, believe in that your greatest gift isn't technique but your person, who you are and express it. You don't have to express it like I do. One of the, I've trained many therapists in this model, one who's extremely good at it, is a very gentle quiet little lady. But she's so subtle in her expressions of emotion, she has a full range of emotion, and kids get it very quickly, as do their parents. But she's not as dramatic as I might be, but it's her person that's being expressed and it's genuine and it's clear what she feels about the people she's working around and she's, her deep interests, compassion. So it's who are you as a person, how do you express that in a way that's genuine, that fits who you are, and that is able to start a reciprocal rhythm with your client based on who they are. Each time it's unique. 

00:59:00
RICH SIMON That's great. Yea, reciprocal rhythm, I like that. All right, so just as, we have few more moments. In terms of resources where people can learn more about what you do and perhaps read things, training opportunities, where should they go? 

00:59:20
DANIEL HUGHES Well, my website is danielhughes.org and my email address is on there. I do trainings and we're at my office in Pennsylvania, up in Maine in the summer as well, and different parts of the country when I'm asked by groups or organizations to do a training. I have a sort of vacation program in this model of treatment. It involves both eight days of training but also a practicum, being supervised by people certified as supervisors in this model. 

00:59:55
RICH SIMON What is this model, Dan, let me just, have you say, and you would, we hadn't really have a name. In this field you have to have a name for what you do, what is it? 

01:00:05
DANIEL HUGHES Well, yea, and I guess because in some ways, I have two names for it so the original when I worked with foster and adoptive kids exclusively was dietic developmental psychotherapy, or DDPT, so that's, that's still the original model. Now it's term, now it's also AFFT, attachment focused family therapy, when I broadened it to working with all families. So the textbook or the, the main book for teaching the model was Attachment-Focused Family Therapy Workbook, by Norton. It came out in 2011.

RICH SIMON Okay, great. All right so, just to point out before we say our goodbyes that those are the resources and you can also find links to Dan's website and mention of his publications on the fulfillment page for this webcast. And again I will remind everyone that this conversation begins on your computer screen but the real important conversation is what comes afterwards, so you'll see on the comment board that we invite you. Take a moment now for your own sake. If we put things into language, we tend to remember them and we tend to feel more engaged in the learning. Take a moment now, what stood out for you, what came to mind, what connections did you make, make between what Dan was talking about other, other approaches in the field or ideas that you may have. If you have questions for Dan, put them in the comment board. He is the, there's no guarantee he will respond. He's like other presenters in this series, these are, these are busy folks, and they will look at it. If they're so moved, you may well get a response to your question. But we all benefit when individuals take the time even just to ask a question, 'cause if you're asking the question, probably someone else has that question as well. So Dan, thank you so much, I can't remember an interview where I got such an immediate and visceral sense of how, how somebody actually, what they do and how they actually sound in their office and what it would be like, and I know what it's, if I was a five year old client, how wonderful it would be to be in psychotherapy with you my friend. Thank you so much.
