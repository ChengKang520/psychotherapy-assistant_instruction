DEVELOPMENTAL COUNSELING AND THERAPY Overview Lecture: Allen Ivey 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  Welcome to developmental counseling and psychotherapy. What I've got to do in a few brief minutes is share with you the, an overview of these tapes and how they might be useful to you and in training. What we found, as we've experienced the developmental model and it gives us an understanding of many other theories. And by the way, much to my surprise, much to our surprise, this turned out to be a theory in its own right, and we do find it going through the various dimensions of DCT, is a helpful way to frame the whole process of counseling and psychotherapy. It doesn't mean it's against another theory. I think it's a way to integrate other theories in a comprehensive developmental model. We hope that some of the pieces of these tapes will be useful to you as you go about generating some of your own ideas about how development fits into the counseling and therapy process. Now, let me provide an overview of what you're going to go through in this tape series. 

00:01:10
PAST DEVELOPMENT INFLUENCES PRESENT DEVELOPMENT 

00:01:10
ALLEN IVEY The first thing is, that's important is to recognize that our past historical life development events reflect themselves in the lives of the clients before us. This will show up in a couple of ways. First of all, what's happened in the past often appears in the present, in the lifestyle, in the verbalization of the client. At same time, past events seemed to be locked, fixed in the body. So you'll find a fair amount of emphasis in this tape on sensor, what we call "sensorimotor" or "body experiencing." So expect that to be an important dimension. Flowing from that, you'll see a lot of attention to images, and- 

00:01:50
IMAGES AND EMOTIONAL CENTRAL 

00:01:50
ALLEN IVEY  images as a base for emotional understanding. Our own feeling is that too much of counseling and psychotherapy reflects on feelings rather than experiencing them in the here and now. And there is a whole epistemology or way of organizing emotion in this series which, I think, can be very helpful to understanding emotional as well as cognitive development. Another piece in this tape is that it's very important to be able to recognize the meaning-making ah, framework of the client. Each client seems to make sense of their experience at a different cognitive developmental level. When I say cognitive developmental level, keep in mind, I mean emotion as well as cognitive. Piaget once said that every emotion is a cognition, and every cognition is emotion. And Piaget's emotional theory has not been given enough attention and we hope we kind of demonstrate in the series some of the more emotional aspects of what we would call a "neo-Pi, Piagetian approach" to counseling and psychotherapy. So in that process, it's important to recognize different levels of emotion, different levels of cognition in the client. And the major tape will be, in the series, we'll show you how to recognize, in the here and now, the interview, the meaning-making cognitive developmental level, emotional level of the client. So you could look forward to that. Following that, there are some basic questioning skills which you can use to organize the world of the client. And one says that questioning skills are not very surprising because at the sensorimotor level, we really wanna get into sensory experience. And you'll find the basic question there as "What do you see here or feel?" but, "What not?" "What do?" "What are you feeling?" to aim toward, here and now, experiencing. At the concrete level, we tend to get into "What are you feeling?" and we start again in the naming emotions and epistemology, the distance has already increased. At the formal operational level, we move to reflecting on feelings, and I think reflecting on feelings is okay. I think it's a useful thing to do, but keep in mind, reflecting on feelings is not experiencing them. And fourthly, feelings occur in a systemic family, multi-cultural context. And we'd, we'll talk about the dialectic systemic level and the issue of looking at feelings and cognitions in a more broad way of framing things. So, what you can do is you can identify the cognitive developmental level of the client, you can ask questions to facilitate horizontal development or a vertical development of the client. I think you'll find these skills useful as a way to integrate different counseling and psychotherapy theories. And that concludes, basically, the first part and the most basic part of this tape, not maybe as far as many of you go. There is a second tape in the series which takes the ideas to life-span development processes. There, we'll be looking at Koji Tomase's(ph) work in life-span development. I think Koji's(ph) work really is an improvement on Erikson's framework and that Koji Tomase's(ph) work from Japan really shows us how to integrate life-span theory in a more multi-cultural way. Then we'll be looking at multi-cultural development and some issues there. We're also going to look at personality disorder, personality style. And we find that DCT is a very helpful way to conceptualize working with varying types of personality disorders or styles. A major tape there, I think we'll take pretty quite a bit of looking and practicing to understand the concepts we have there. Finally, we have a tape on ah, treatment planning, an issue on how you can organize the systematic treatment plan for program at these various cognitive developmental levels. This is a lot of material, and to really master it, we will take literally ah, a semester. It's, and a semester begins in a small way. The first step really is to get an overview of the theory perhaps from an introductory presentation and the issue of images. Then, the second thing to do is to master identifying cognitive developmental levels. Once you've mastered noticing the cognitive level of the client, the cognitive and the emotional level of the client, then you can go to questioning to expand development at the level where they are, or questionings to move them vertically, and vertically is not just up, it's down. In this model, higher is not better. All levels of cognition are considered valid. So there's a lot in this model. For me, it's been rather profound in my way of integrating helping, and I understand counseling and therapy in new ways. In one way, we are really naming a lot of things that people already do very, very well in a little different way. Yet, this different way, you will find ah, if you read some of the books and theories behind, this really go back not only to Piaget but very deeply in Western philosophy to Plato. Now there's a distinction, as I wind up here, there's a major distinction we should keep in mind. Piaget organizes cognitive levels higher ardently(ph); higher is better. Plato, in the Allegory of the Cave, organized and searched for the ideal and higher form of knowledge. Drawing from the feminist critique of Egarie(ph) ah, our own experience, ah, Native American traditions, Afro-American traditions; we're beginning to understand them more. Ah, Asante's work in Afrocentric theory, we're talking about development as holistic. 

00:07:20
"HIGHER IS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER" 

00:07:20
ALLEN IVEY And we reject, refute the Platonic, the Piagetian idea that higher is better. Development is holistic. We do exist in interdependent world. DCT, and I'll end finally with this particular point. Traditionally the goal of counseling and psychotherapy has been autonomy, self-actualization, and independence, free will. Ah, we again think that's a nice concept but we see it limited, again drawing from Asante and the Native American gro, tradition, from the Asian-American tradition, we believe we live in an interdependent world in which we are related one with another. And while we're working on issues of cognitive, emotional development, we're developing in a family and a multi-cultural, a group context. And so while we're working a lot in this tape on individual issues, we hope you'll always remember the family and the cultural context within which we develop. And again, we see the goal of counseling and therapy as interdependence, how can we work together more completely, one with another.

ALLEN IVEY  Together more completely, one with another. 

00:08:45
The Importance of Images: The First DCT Video Demonstration Allen and Mary Ivey 

00:08:45
ALLEN IVEY  What Mary and I would like to share with you is the very first tape we ever made on developmental counseling and psychotherapy, is where we discovered that the ideas of the book, Developmental Therapy, indeed do work. This, in effect, is a home movie. Ah, our good friend, Bruce Oldershaw, was there with the mini-cam, and ah, taken in our own living room of all places. And I said, well, I decided I'd try these skills with Mary. What I'd like you to notice is, and what we discovered even more dramatically in this is the importance of images. You'll also see at the beginning of this tape, some struggles, as I sort of fumble around. Remember it's the first I've ever done the work, the systematic questioning sequence of DCT. But that's okay because the ultimate goal, we're all gonna struggle a bit, the ultimate goal is to get that image fairly rooted in the body. I'd like you also, as you watch the tape, to notice your experience. To give you a little background for the tape, ah, Mary, just be prior to the questions which focused on images, has been talking about constant fights with her daughter, Elizabeth. Elizabeth, at that point, was a senior in high school, and a very common thing that happens around this important time of separation is a mother and a daughter fight a lot. So, imagine that Mary has come in to me to counsel her, talking about problems of fighting with her teenage daughter which go on and on and on. And in the situation, I then go to some standard developmental questions. I'd like you to notice your reaction to these questions. After each segment, there'll be a short break, ah, you'll notice on the screen to explain what's happening and then, but particularly notice your own feelings inside your body as you observe Mary on this tape. I think you'll find it interesting. 

00:11:00
Developing Image of Life Experience NOTE: THIS SEGMENT ADDED TO TAPE IN 1993. VIDEO IS OLD AND MAY BE PROBLEM ON SOME SETS. IF SO SKIP THIS SEGMENT. 

00:11:00
ALLEN IVEY  What's in your mind today, Mary? 

00:11:15
MARY B. IVEY (sighs) Well, I'm really upset. (sighs) Another couple of weeks and my daughter is gonna leave for college, and it, it feels terrible. I, I, I don't know why, we've been fighting a lot this last couple of weeks, and, and I wanted her to go away and everything to be really good. I, I wanted us to feel good about each other and for her to be happy and for us to have a good relationship, and it's really upsetting, all this fighting that's going on. 

00:11:40
MARY PRESENTS A TYPICAL MOTHER-DAUGHTER CONFLICT AROUND LEAVING HOME. IN THIS NET SEGMENT, ALLEN FOR THE FIRST TIME DEMONSTRATES DCT AND IMAGE WORK. NOTE YOUR PERSONAL REACTIONS TO MARY. 

00:11:40
MARY B. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
ALLEN IVEY First of all, what did you feel, what are you, what did you feel right then when you're talking about ah, your daughter leaving? 

00:12:05
MARY B. IVEY Oh, I think I feel sadness. Ah, it's, it's really sad after all these years to finally have those years over. 

00:12:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I see your eyes smiling as you talked about sadness. 

00:12:15
MARY B. IVEY Well, I don't know if they're smiling. I feel like I have tears. I'm, I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ALLEN IVEY But d'you get more of those feelings of sadness? 

00:12:20
MARY B. IVEY  Hmm. (sighs) It just feels very, very sad. 

00:12:25
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. It, and what type of, and when you see her is, when you hear her leaving, you get that feeling of leaving, what do you see? What type of visual image comes to your mind? 

00:12:45
MARY B. IVEY I see a little girl about two years old and I'm remembering what she looked liked when she was two. 

00:12:55
STOP TAPE WHAT WERE YOU FEELING/THINKING WHILE WATCHING THIS TAPE? CAN YOU LOCATE THE FEELINGS IN A SPECIFIC PLACE IN YOUR BODY? SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THIS TAPE. IN THE VERY SHORT SEGMENT, MARY ACCESSED VIA IMAGING HER SENSORIMOTOR EXPERIENCE. LET'S LOOK AT THAT BRIEF SEGMENT AGAIN. FOCUS ON HERE AND NOW EMOTION 

00:12:55
MARY B. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
ALLEN IVEY First of all, what did you feel, what are you, what did you feel right then when you're talking about ah, your daughter leaving? 

00:13:30
MARY B. IVEY Oh, I think I feel sadness. Ah, it's, it's really sad after all these years to finally have those years over. 

00:13:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I see- 

00:13:40
FOCUS ON NONVERBAL DISCREPANCIES 

00:13:40
ALLEN IVEY - your eyes smiling as you talked about sadness. 

00:13:40
MARY B. IVEY Well, I don't know if they're smiling. I feel like I have tears. I'm, I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
ALLEN IVEY But d'you get more- 

00:13:45
MAGNIFYING FEELINGS 

00:13:45
ALLEN IVEY - of those feelings of sadness? 

00:13:45
MARY B. IVEY  Hmm. (sighs) It just feels very, very sad. 

00:13:50
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. It, And- 

00:13:55
SEEKING IMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH EMOTION. 

00:13:55
ALLEN IVEY  what type of, and when you see her is, when you hear her leaving, you get that feeling of leaving, what do you see? What type of visual image comes to your mind? 

00:14:10
MARY B. IVEY (sighs) I see a little girl about two years old and I'm remembering what she looked liked when she was two. 

00:14:20
Most clients have images of important past situations. Through emotions, they can be easily accessed. This is a powerful technique and should be used ethically. In this brief segment, Mary has experienced her feelings at the sensorimotor level and demonstrated this through bodily experience. To help a client talk about issues at the concrete operational level, ask for details and specifics. CONCRETE OPERATIONAL EXAMPLES 

00:14:20
ALLEN IVEY  So, Mary, its, I've seen you have some very deep feelings about your daughter leaving and you have some powerful memories from the past. 

00:15:00
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
ALLEN IVEY At the same time, you've had some ah, pretty heavy arguments ah, this last month or so as she's getting ready to leave. 

00:15:10
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
ALLEN IVEY Could you tell me- 

00:15:10
COUNSELOR CONCRETENESS TENDS TO LEAD TO CLIENT CONCRETE OPERATIONS 

00:15:10
ALLEN IVEY - about, specifically about one of those arguments, what happened and what did she say, what did you say or. 

00:15:15
MARY B. IVEY Well, it was the day she was going to be interviewed for a, uhm, ah, scholarship and she put on a pair of slacks and oh, kind of a funny-looking, you know, her kinda tops that she wears that aren't very flattering, big and bulky. And she asked if, if I, if I thought that outfit looks nice for the interview. And I said, well, you know, no, I, I thought maybe the shirt might be okay when she better change her pants or something. And so she went... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
MARY IVEY ...down and changed the outfit and put something else on. And that didn't look any better, and then I decided, I thought, then I sugge, suggested to her, "Well, why don't you wear a skirt and a top?" I mean, people, or interviewing, you know, they usually judge you on what you're wearing. And she got very angry at me and she said, "No, they are not gonna judge me on what I'm wearing. They're gonna judge me on what I have to say." And she went yelling downstairs and screaming but then she did put on a skirt and a top and, you know, was kind of angry about the whole thing, and went storming out the door, saying she didn't like me telling her what to do. 

00:16:20
Mary's concrete, linear story gives us a good example of concrete operatiional client stories, full of detail. FORMAL OPERATIONAL PATTERNS 

00:16:20
ALLEN IVEY  So, Mary we've heard how strongly have these positive feelings about your daughter and we've heard also about these arguments. Is there any way- 

00:16:45
SEARCH OF FORMAL PATTERNS 

00:16:45
ALLEN IVEY - you can put that together in a pattern which might explain what's going on between you and she? 

00:16:55
MARY B. IVEY Well, I think it has to do with my feeling very strongly about her and loving her ah, and wanted to help her, and it, it becomes very difficult. 

00:17:05
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. So it's very difficult- 

00:17:10
REFLECTION OF FEELINGS 

00:17:10
ALLEN IVEY - or you to deal with your feelings in relationship to her? 

00:17:15
MARY B. IVEY I think it's hard to deal with those feelings of separation, feelings of leaving and sadness about that. 

00:17:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So as you think about those feelings- 

00:17:25
FEELINGS OCCUR IN MULTIPLE SITUATIONS 

00:17:25
ALLEN IVEY - as separation and leaving, has it shown up for you in other situations as separation and leaving for in terms of them being powerful experiences for you? 

00:17:35
MARY B. IVEY Maybe I'm reminded when I had to leave home. Other situations with my daughter or with my own, in my own life? 

00:17:40
ALLEN IVEY  Either one. 

00:17:45
MARY B. IVEY Couple of things come to mind, I guess, reminded me when I left home, the time I went to college, those feelings. Uhm, pain(ph) is just very difficult. Leaving is hard. 

00:17:55
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. So we have a lot of feelings around leaving. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. So, Mary, separation, leaving, very powerful, (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
ALLEN IVEY important experience. Ah, how do you look at it now as we talked for a while? 

00:18:15
MARY B. IVEY Well, I think I- 

00:18:15
MARY REFLECTS ON HER FEELINGS 

00:18:15
MARY B. IVEY - look at it a little more positively. I think a lot of these feelings are normal feelings. Feelings of sadness, and, and some ways, I think a feeling of joy that, that a period of life is completed. 

00:18:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
MARY B. IVEY And, ah, you know, I, I think it's okay. 

00:18:35
ALLEN IVEY You think it's okay? 

00:18:35
MARY B. IVEY  Well, I just have to deal with my feelings and it's time to move on. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
MARY B. IVEY I remember my mother saying, "Healthy birds fly away." And, I think that's true. 

00:18:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
In this segment, Mary reflected on her feelings using pattern thought, characteristic of formal operations. SUMMARY OF THE PRECEDING THREE SEGMENTS: 1. MARY DEMONSTRATED SENSORI-MOTOR EXPERIENCES USING IMAGES. 2. SHE DISCUSSED A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM. 3. SHE REFLECTED ON HER FEELINGS USING OPERATIONAL THOUGHT. SOME EXERCISES, PARTICULARLY AT THE SENSORI-MOTOR LEVEL CAN BE QUITE POWERFUL AND SHOULD BE USED WITH RESPECT AND SENSITIVITY. DEVELOPMENTAL COUNSELING AND THERAPY by Allen E. Ivey and Mary Bradford Ivey Produced by Bruce Oldershaw Camera Person, Anthony Rigazio-DiGilio COPYRIGHT 1990 MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES BOX 641 NORTH AMHERST, MA 01059 Introduction and Overview ALLEN E. IVEY AND MARY BRADFORD IVEY 

00:18:50
ALLEN IVEY  Developmental counseling and psychotherapy is very much about you and your own personal reactions in the interview. As you listen to this brief introductory statement, I'd like you to allow yourself to drift a little bit and think about your own images of change, development, and human growth because it's your images, your experience that are going to make the difference in your understanding and usage of these concepts. Ah, development is a complex word and one way to define it is the word, change. As you talk to me, just think for a minute about a change you went through in your life. Think about a time who was there, who helped, how did you feel during that change. Just the word "change" often equals development. The second type of development is that life-span progression that Erik Erikson talks about. You move from childhood to elementary school, elementary school to adolescence. You move to marriage or you move to a permanent relationship. Ah, all kinds of discoveries about yourself as we move through life. Kubler Ross points out the dealing with death, just kind of our final transition. Think about your only images around these issues. And finally, Nancy Schlossberg has another interesting way for us to think about development. She calls it the "non-transition." Sometimes, something we want to have happened as part of our life, but just playin' it doesn't happened. The baby doesn't come, we don't get that wonderful new job, our expectations aren't reached: these often are painful passages, painful times of transition. Think about some of the developmental things that you wanted to have happened and didn't happen for you. Development, obviously, is a rich and complex thing. It brings about many, many images in my mind. In this tape series, we're gonna share some of those ideas with you on how to help people understand and negotiate transitions and non-transitions. Can we stop the tape now for a moment and you share with one another those images and ideas that you've generated in your own experience as we've talked just here? 

00:21:40
STOP TAPE AND SHARE YOUR OWN PERSONAL IMAGES, IDEAS, AND EXPERIENCES AROUND DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGE, LIFE-SPAN PROGRESSION, AND NON-TRANSITION. Demonstration of DCT's Four Basic Levels: Opening Discussion 

00:21:40
ALLEN IVEY  There's a lot that goes around in us in this issue of transition. What I'd like to do now is just to explore, you know, in video tape for a short time, a classic developmental transition. That is, what occurs between a mother and child or in a family when kids leave home. This leaving home is a time that we all know of stress, challenge, and of course, a wonderful opportunity. So, now I'd like to focus on Mary and have her reflect about this time of developmental transition. Mary is right at the stage where her kids have gone to college and she's experiencing new things in her life, and yet there still are old attachments there. The transition is still there very much and you could see that. Mary, (clears throat) could you... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
ALLEN IVEY ...tell me a little bit about your feelings? (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:22:40
ALLEN IVEY Your kids now are ah, sophomores and seniors in school, what's going on between you and them, and how do you feel? 

00:22:50
MARY B. IVEY Well, I, I think it's a, a different relationship in some ways. We were just, you know, they are to visit them on Parent Weekend. And, you know, it, some of the same issues are there as before, (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
MARY B. IVEY but it's different. There's a little distance. I find I miss them in different ways, (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
MARY B. IVEY you know? You have to keep contact by phone, uhm, very excited to see them. Uhm, I have mixed feelings when they return, because I wonder... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
MARY B. IVEY ...if the old kind of problems are going to come back as they come back or are they going to be grown up and different. I have mixed feelings. 

00:23:25
ALLEN IVEY Come back and focus- 

00:23:25
Transitions bring mixed feelings 

00:23:25
ALLEN IVEY - on me here, and this issue of mixed feelings around transitions that Mary expressed is very, very much to be expected. The joy, the sadness, and also, if you live in a family, you got unresolved issues. Ah, I'd like to follow up in some of these unresolved issues for Mary and I'd like you to notice how I approach this from a DCT, developmental counseling and therapy, framework. First, I'm going to ask her to get an image in her mind of these issues. And then I'll talk about that briefly. Mary, you mentioned, (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
ALLEN IVEY  ah, an issue despite the fact that things are going generally well, there is an, an, there are almost always unresolved issues. Ah, what are some of the unresolved issues that you might be willing to share here in front of national television? 

00:24:15
MARY B. IVEY Well, I guess I, I look back in my own parenting style and I wonder if I, you know, I was set enough boundaries for the children then, and I was strict enough and, and really guided them in their development, studies. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY So, so one of the- 

00:24:30
Preoperational problem 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY - things is, you feel is a boundary issue? (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
MARY B. IVEY  Uh hmm Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
ALLEN IVEY Could you think back on this last weekend- 

00:24:35
Discussion of Issue at the Sensori-Motor Level: Note use of Images in DCT 

00:24:35
ALLEN IVEY - and some place where you felt this boundary issue? Would you get very specific about that issue? 

00:24:40
MARY B. IVEY  Uhm, well, I, I, I think of going out for dinner the very first night and, and we're all in this lovely restaurant. We had, you know, welcome, wonderful reunions, you know, and talking with each of the girls but feeling a little bit tense as the four of us are there, wondering one, one girl's gonna say something that's gonna set the other girl up. You know, often, Kathy's gonna say... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
MARY B. IVEY ...something that's gonna set Liv, Liz off, and, and just wondering when that's gonna happen and, and how, how I'm gonna react. 

00:25:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
MARY B. IVEY It, it's if, just a feeling of tension. 

00:25:15
ALLEN IVEY So it. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
MARY B. IVEY And they did. They did with a little bit of a put down and you could just... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:25:15
MARY B. IVEY ...feel, all those old feelings coming back. 

00:25:20
ALLEN IVEY You get the image- 

00:25:20
Images highlight issues 

00:25:20
ALLEN IVEY - of this particular time there was a put down between the girls. 

00:25:25
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
ALLEN IVEY Can you see that in your mind? 

00:25:25
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
ALLEN IVEY What do you see? 

00:25:25
MARY B. IVEY Well, I'm looking across at, at Kathy and, and, ah, knowing how she's struggling to being a younger sister like that to, ah, say the right thing with her older sister there and do the right thing. And, and I could just see Liz ready to pounce on her, you know. I just, you know, almost attacking her and I, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
MARY B. IVEY and, ah, you know, catching her up. Oh, (sighs) you know, and I'm just, I want Liz to lay back, you know, relax, she's fine. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. So I, I see you're kinda smiling as you're talking about that and yet I see you moving. What are you experiencing as you get that image, that visual image in your mind and then across the table? 

00:26:05
MARY B. IVEY I, I'm (giggling) experiencing- 

00:26:05
Re-experiences in here and now 

00:26:05
MARY B. IVEY - I, I'm feeling tension, I'm feeling, you know, the, the number of fights those kids had over. God knows why they, you know, they fight about clothes, they fight about this and that. And... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:26:15
MARY B. IVEY ...one minute, they can get along and the next minute. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
ALLEN IVEY And you're talking about the kids now, Mary. 

00:26:15
Focusing on image 

00:26:15
ALLEN IVEY What, what are you feeling as you've seen that? 

00:26:20
MARY B. IVEY I'm feeling, I'm feeling anxiety, I'm feeling pain, pain... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY What kind of pain? 

00:26:25
MARY B. IVEY ...of some of the arguments that they had. That's painful when they argue for me. I don't like when they argue. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
MARY B. IVEY It hurts. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
ALLEN IVEY Can you tell me a little bit more about the pain, where, where it was? 

00:26:30
MARY B. IVEY Well, in,- 

00:26:30
Locating feelings in the body 

00:26:30
MARY B. IVEY  -(sighs) I guess, in the pit of my (laughs) stomach. It, it feels terrible, it, it, you know, that, that they should be fighting. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
ALLEN IVEY As beautiful as it all, there's still pain. 

00:26:40
MARY B. IVEY Right. 

00:26:40
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Come back, ah, I'll sort of swing back in here again and interrupt, ah, basically, we have what appears to be, ah, relatively successful family transition. And yet, you all know what it's like to go home. At this point, you may wanna stop the tape and think about how, I love the words, "stop the tape," you might not stop your own tape, as you're watching this tape, and talk about how we replay old family tapes when we go home with our parents and you may be identifying with Mary, as dealing with your own kids, or you may be that child, who's had parents coming in and making certain expectations of you. DCT would argue by the way, is these visual images in allowing ourself to get in touch with sensorimotor feelings that are so critical in understanding what's going on our experience. And we do a lot of our work in rooting in sensorimotor experience. Let's stop the tape for a moment and you yourself see if you can get into some visual images of a time in transition or non-transition and share that again with your groups. 

00:27:40
STOP TAPE AND EXAMINE VISUAL IMAGES 

00:27:40
ALLEN IVEY  One of the hardest things for all of us to do, ah, in counseling and psychotherapy is to really get in touch with what we call a sensorimotor area. As you may have noticed, I had to struggle with Mary a little bit, hopefully not push her too much to get her in touch with some of the real pains there, even in the middle of a joyous occasion. You'll find in your practice sessions with DCT, that you, yourself, will prefer to reflect on feelings rather than to experience them in the here and now. The real guts of, of this program, I think, is learning how to sense your own body,- 

00:28:20
Search for felt body sense 

00:28:20
ALLEN IVEY - get in touch, and help your clients get in touch with their sensorimotor feelings 'coz it is here, I believe, that affect really lies. Think about the word, "reflect feelings," that means you're putting the feeling out there then, ins, instead of experiencing feelings. Well, really, in it's essence DCT breaks down the four very common questions. One is what do you see, hear or feel. That focuses at the sensorimotor level. The second one, could you give me a concrete example. There's a familiar question at least, the concreteness, except we say, it's concrete operations. The third question is, is that a pattern or does it happen a lot, at least to us, to reflect on situations or reflect on ourselves, the formal operational thoughts. What we call, the "dialectic/systemic," is, is not quite so familiar, we'd like to know where does that pattern come from? How do we put it all together? Was there flow in the pattern? And as you look at our written material, you'll feel that, you'll feel and find, that it is a very complex area. What I'd like to do now, is demonstrate just very briefly with Mary, obviously, a coached client, although she was not coached for the first session, ah, and what's gonna come up now will be spontaneous. Just briefly, these four developmental levels, and I'd like to talk a little bit more about them. 

00:29:35
Concrete discussion of issue: note linear descriptions 

00:29:35
ALLEN IVEY  So Mary, we did, you did experience this feeling of pain. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
ALLEN IVEY could you give me a concrete, specific example of sometime in the past where you had that same feeling of pain in your stomach. What was said, what happened? 

00:29:55
MARY B. IVEY Well, I, I, I think of a zillions of times that they could, the two girls are getting dressed in the morning to go to school or even when they come for vacation and somehow, there's gonna be something that's gonna happen, where one person's gonna borrow something from somebody else, and is not gonna return it in the. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
ALLEN IVEY Can you think of a specific time this has happened? 

00:30:10
Note concrete specifics 

00:30:10
MARY B. IVEY Ah, well, I guess, one of many mornings, uhm, where they get up and argue about what they're gonna wear and, (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
MARY B. IVEY you know, they've spent hours thinking about the night before and then in the morning they get up. (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ALLEN IVEY The arguments, ah, loud? 

00:30:25
MARY B. IVEY Uhm, they start off very kind of soft and then they sort of increase, depending upon what has happened, (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
MARY B. IVEY who has borrowed what from... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
MARY B. IVEY ...who, what, what they borrowed from each other. And, uhm, you know, just the, just the snotty comments, I call it. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
Search for sequence 

00:30:40
ALLEN IVEY So, it starts out the, sort of the A is, is kinda quiet and they're arguing... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
ALLEN IVEY ...about clothes for example... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
ALLEN IVEY  and then, the B, the behavior is, what happens? 

00:30:50
MARY B. IVEY Uhm, somebody realizes that, that, that, uhm, you know, that they borrowed something they haven't returned it in the right condition, you know, it's not looking at all, maybe there's a spot up a skirt that's being returned or a blouse or something like that. 

00:31:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. And what are they feeling at that B stage? 

00:31:05
MARY B. IVEY What they are feeling? 

00:31:10
ALLEN IVEY And what are they saying? 

00:31:10
MARY B. IVEY Well, it, I, they're, they're feeling, uhm, mad at each other, you know, it's just what happens... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:15
MARY B. IVEY ...they get angry. 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY And then the C. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
MARY B. IVEY And then it accelerates. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY Does the consequence, accelerates and what happens when it accelerates at C? (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
MARY B. IVEY And sometimes I go in there at that point and, and, you know, let's figure this out, let's, I'm, I'm the peacemaker, I try to, (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
MARY B. IVEY you know, keep thing calm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY So the consequence is you come in... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY ...and try to cool it. 

00:31:30
MARY B. IVEY Try to calm things down. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
ALLEN IVEY  Okay. Now, we could look at this, I've tried here very, very briefly to say that, we look here in the concrete area, (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
MARY B. IVEY Hmm. 

00:31:40
ALLEN IVEY specific behaviors. And here's a particular case I try to do, hmm, moderately effective, it could bet, could be better she'd had a more precise case. The Antecedent, the Behavior and the Consequence. The antecedent was the argument. The behavior was the argument and yelling. And the consequence is Mary comes over. And begin to see the flow of a system and their reinforcement conditions, you could also do that same type of analysis with a rational motive therapy which is pretty good with this type of analysis as well, but we look more at the cognitions. Ah, at another level, we could explore this obviously, in great depth. In another level, we can look at the, the pattern and, ah, in this case, let's come back to Mary... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
ALLEN IVEY ...and I'll do more of a Rogerian-type of thing. Ah, but I'll ask, I'll ask a question instead, Mary, as this goes on- 

00:32:30
Formal exploration 

00:32:30
ALLEN IVEY - what is your pattern of thought and feeling as this occurs? What's going on inside you, personally, as this is happening? 

00:32:35
MARY B. IVEY  Personally, I'm playing a very familiar role in which just trying to keep the peace, I think I did that with my own family and I'm doing that here now trying to keep things quiet, trying to help people get along, no arguments, uhm, I, I don't like that, I don't like conflict. 

00:32:50
ALLEN IVEY So one of your lifestyles is just to avoid conflict. 

00:32:55
MARY B. IVEY Right. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:32:55
MARY B. IVEY Keep the peace. 

00:32:55
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And I noticed that another patterns and you, you tend to, come, I ask you for your feelings and you tend to come up with content. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
ALLEN IVEY What if, could you just stop for a moment, and just reflect on your feelings? What is your pattern of feeling in this type of situation? What are you feeling? 

00:33:10
Repeating pattern 

00:33:10
MARY B. IVEY I feel whenever there's conflict I feel the anxiety and I feel a need to do something about it, a need to go in and rescue things to, to, uhm, make things, (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
MARY B. IVEY smooth things over, make things work better in the family. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY I've seen your body that you're... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
MARY B. IVEY Yeah, trying, (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
ALLEN IVEY ...trying to get everything. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
MARY B. IVEY trying to get everything organized and smooth down and calm down. 

00:33:30
ALLEN IVEY So your pattern in the family... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
ALLEN IVEY ...in this transition, is that to smooth things down. 

00:33:30
MARY B. IVEY Right. 

00:33:30
ALLEN IVEY And, (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
MARY B. IVEY  Try to make everything work well. 

00:33:35
ALLEN IVEY and as I come back again on the screen, I think we all know that if we have a pattern of trying to smooth things down, it may smooth things down for a while. And as the, ah, I'll have to grin(ph) on this one as, as the stepfather in his splendid family, I do know that these, ah, these issues do pop up again and that leads to the fourth dimension which we call, the "dialectic/systemic." There is a system that's going on, and I'm sure, those of you that do systemic thinking are already thinking about this. There are also are some feminist issues, women are expected to do certain thing and you see Mary interacting with her two daughters. So I'd like to do at the fourth level is just to ask Mary to reflect about what's going on in the system to perpetuate this particular type of thing, which ultimately is then the pain, actual, physical pain at the dinner table on a, what generally a happy weekend. And by the way, will who of you hasn't experienced some type of pain when mother or father, stepfather, ah, uncle hasn't said something for the 698 times you, ah, these are patterns which often occur in systems as well. So Mary, we know a little about systems now- 

00:34:40
Dialectic/systemic exploration 

00:34:40
ALLEN IVEY what's the system which produces all of these, in your perspective? This is a sort of step back and do, still another epistemological step, another level of reflection. 

00:34:50
MARY B. IVEY Well, I think it's a system that evolved. 

00:34:50
Reflection on systems of operations 

00:34:50
MARY B. IVEY You have, uhm, ah, a mother and two daughters who've triangulated(ph) or, you know, been together for a period of five years and then we form a blended family and bring in a stepfather and two stepbrothers and, and in trying to do this, it's hard to leave the old system behind which is I think we call it sometimes, "three sisters getting along," and, and more of a equal relationship as opposed to me taking more of, ah, a stronger position with the girls and. (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
ALLEN IVEY And so the stepfather in this case, me, sometimes doesn't integrate well into the system. 

00:35:25
MARY B. IVEY (laughs) Right. Unfortunately. 

00:35:30
ALLEN IVEY We're grinning but, ah, it isn't always been, (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
MARY B. IVEY It's difficult. It's, it's a struggle. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
ALLEN IVEY it, it isn't been material. 

00:35:30
MARY B. IVEY No, and it's a struggle, it's a struggle. 

00:35:35
ALLEN IVEY Now, we also know this comes an issues in intergenerational family history. 

00:35:40
MARY B. IVEY Right. 

00:35:40
ALLEN IVEY How does mother and grandmother, at least in your part, fit in into this picture? 

00:35:40
MARY B. IVEY  Well, uhm, I think my mother was much stronger than I and probably did just the opposite. She ran the show at home and, and I think if there were arguments in our family, with my sister, or my father, mother, or anything, and if mother wasn't happy, I was still again playing the same role of, of keeping things settled, smoothed... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:05
MARY B. IVEY ...making things, went okay, making sure things went okay. 

00:36:10
ALLEN IVEY So even as a young child... (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
Family pattern repeats 

00:36:10
ALLEN IVEY ...you, you played that peacemaker role? 

00:36:10
MARY B. IVEY Right. So, coming, doing this right now, is a very familiar sort of thing, it doesn't work, it's very ineffective lots of times but... (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
MARY B. IVEY  that's what I do. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Thanks so much Mary. 

00:36:20
MARY B. IVEY Thank you. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY Ah, anything you wanna add before I do a closing thing? I gotta give you. 

00:36:25
MARY B. IVEY No, I, I, you know, I, I, ah, commend the stepfamilies that, you know- 

00:36:30
Summary comments 

00:36:30
MARY B. IVEY - I think this is a Counselor's struggle, working... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
MARY B. IVEY ...putting blended families together, and it's something... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
MARY B. IVEY ...we have to keep working at all the time. 

00:36:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. And as a stepfather, ah, one of the most reassuring things I ever had when, when there's an article on the Wall Street Journal, with Mary and I had been married about two weeks, when they said, at first, the 100 percent of blended families, get into difficulties. But then maybe reach the 100 percent of families get into difficulties. Ah, so, if you don't have a family that has difficulties, ah, come on, we'll put you on videotape next. Ah, but what I'd like you to do at this point, is think a little bit about what Mary and I have done. We started with pretty simple incident, it sound like your great weekend, you say, "So what?" They had it, they went over and had a weekend together at a college weekend. We take one little issue, a little pain at the dinner table, we then move to the sensorimotor level and get to the real feeling of pain that's there even in the middle of all the joy. Sometimes, did you know that pain can destroy a whole event for us. We find if we go back, we can find specific, concrete examples of the same type of feeling in other situations we call this, "concreteness." And then, we do find of course, a formal operational pattern. What is missing in much counseling and psychotherapy however, is that there is a system, and there is an intergenerational family that often place(ph) itself out. One of our purposes in these series is to open up a possibility of multilevel interventions. We'll argue that treatment plans and need to include all four levels. You'll be getting specific questions, specific ways to diagnose an ex, an excess, different types of cognitive experience. Also, we'll be looking at the issue, how to develop treatment plans. And by the way, we'll have a tape, which I particularly find helpful. 

00:38:15
Multi-level treatment plans 

00:38:15
ALLEN IVEY We take these basic concepts and show how to use them with really complex issues such as depression, personality disorder, ah, also, and believe it or not, you can use it with normal kids. As you can tell, Mary and I, ah, and so are people in the rest of this team, are very enthused about this framework. We think it's immensely practical. It doesn't deny other approaches. It says, we gotta think about assertiveness training. We've got to think about family therapy. We've got to think about Rogerian skills. We've got to think about Gestalt, meditation. A whole wrap to treatment procedures are needed and necessary to help people work together more effectively. DCT is a specific set of techniques but it also is an integrating framework for looking at other forms of counseling and therapy. 

00:39:00
The Positive Asset Search: Critical for Client Growth 

00:39:00
ALLEN IVEY  DCT argues that as we work with any client, normal, depressed, pathological, on the other hand, I think we're all normal, we're all working at developmental issues. There's a need to spend time on finding positives in the client. There's a tendency in doing counseling and psychotherapy, and family therapy work, always look at what's wrong. And so as part of any treatment plan, a part of any interview, there needs to be some focus on the positives. So before we start looking at the session that, issues that Mary has brought out, I'd like just to focus on some of the strengths. You can use these strengths periodically to help the client and families look at themselves a little more positively. As you look at yourself more positively, it's a little easier to go on to depth. So Mary, there are some strengths... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
MARY B. IVEY Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, in this family. Obviously, they stay together. Could you kinda go through some of the positives, 'coz we're gonna try to look at some of the issues that still are going on. What are some of the real strengths that we can draw on? 

00:40:05
MARY B. IVEY Well, I think the real strength in the family is the fact that, as you, as you, we both know that when all the children are together, all four of them, that it's absolutely wonderful and there's never, ever been an argument in nine years. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
MARY B. IVEY They've just, they all, the girls admire the boys, and, ah, or the young men, and their wives and it's, ah, it's very pleasant, very nice. 

00:40:25
ALLEN IVEY So one of the strengths that you've been lucky enough that the two sets of kids get along okay. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
MARY B. IVEY Beautifully. 

00:40:30
ALLEN IVEY What is some, what is some strengths, ah, in, ah, in your daughters? 

00:40:35
MARY B. IVEY Well, I think that, ah, when you're a sophomore and a senior in college and the senior looking forward to graduate school, uhm, having successfully completed several internships and, and, you know, having friends and just doing well in school, I think that's wonderful. (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
MARY B. IVEY If, if you complete college and look to, you know, look forward to a bright future. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:55
MARY B. IVEY And the sophomore also is, they're both interested in communication and, and, ah, I'm very proud of, of... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
MARY B. IVEY ...the work that they've done. 

00:41:00
ALLEN IVEY And I hear, one of the strengths that you're proud, enthused and... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY ...feel very genuine about these accomplishments. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
MARY B. IVEY Right. I do. 

00:41:05
ALLEN IVEY I think feeling good about these accomplishments makes it a little safer to go and look at some of those problems. We also as a family, do I have any strengths to contribute to this? 

00:41:15
MARY B. IVEY I think you've been a wonderful role model and a wonderful, I, I think an inspiration for their feminism, for their, ah, achievement academically, uhm, you know, you're there to dialogue with them, to, you know, make them think a little more. 

00:41:30
ALLEN IVEY So, (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
MARY B. IVEY And that's very good. 

00:41:30
ALLEN IVEY toss it to you, how does a positive, how, how might the positive assets has helped you or any other client deal with some of the pain? It's just there with all of us all the time. 

00:41:40
MARY B. IVEY I think it's wonderful to have the, you have the think about the strengths and you need the strengths and to, and to continue focusing on the strengths when you deal with the problems that are there in, inevitably, in daily life. And if you keep in mind the strengths that the family has and the individuals in that family have then I think you can work at some of the areas that are more difficult that we all struggle with. 

00:42:00
ALLEN IVEY Rogers calls this, "positive regard." Victor Frankl(ph) calls it, "finding positive meanings." 

00:42:10
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm 

00:42:10
End Introduction & Overview Assessing Cognitive - Development Level MARY IVEY, KATHY BOHN, ELIZABETH BOHN, ALLEN IVEY, SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO, IMANI ROSA, HODGES GLENN AND ELSA ORJUELA 

00:42:10
MARY B. IVEY  It's very important for you to be able to assess the cognitive-developmental levels of your clients. You each have a handout with the cognitive-developmental levels, ah, listed. In this next segment, I'd like to have you look at an adolescent and, and see what developmental level that she is presenting. 

00:42:55
Which of the four cognitive levels is the most prominent in the following example? 

00:42:55
KATHY BOHN  I had a physical at eight 'clock this morning. Nice, the lady told me that I was, I, I made her late. I couldn't believe it. I, I backed up her schedule. I have an application due, great. I told her I was at the post office, she said, I don't care, you're making me late. Social studies. The worst. I did the reading but, ah, I didn't answer one single question. Math class was the pits. I'm sitting in that class, the class is so dumb, I can't believe it. I get home tonight, mom finds out that I have to, have, ah, that I have to have, ah, ah, pay 44, $44 for this late registration standby fee for achievements. She flipped out. I couldn't believe it. I, ah, I said I'd go to the bank and she goes, "no, no, don't go to the bank, don't go to the bank. I'll pay for it. I just wanna get you through college, you're such an absent-minded senior. Absent-minded senior, I'm going." I have five applications due but before Christmas and I can't even, I can't even begin to comprehend how I'm gonna work these out. I have three papers due this week. It's, it's so much pressure. I have, I've three opens and I don't even know what to do with them. I have such a headache by the end of the day that I'm just, I sit there. 

00:44:05
MARY B. IVEY Clients present their preoperational problems at various cognitive-developmental levels. Some of you might've thought Kathy presented at the concrete level and some of you thought that she might've presented at the sensorimotor level. I guess, we might say theoretically, that she presented, ah, at the sensorimotor level. She tended to be rather random in her thinking, rather here and now, and very much on focusing, ah, the experiences of her feelings. The type of counseling needed for this type of client would be an environmentally-structuring type of counseling or behavior modification program so that a safe environment could be provided for her. In this next segment, let's take a look at Kathy and see at what level she is presenting. 

00:44:45
Concrete example: linear description 

00:44:45
KATHY BOHN  I got into school today. It was raining out. It was really awful day and I come in for my physical and I was late. And I'd forgotten my note and I was looking for it all over my bag and, and, and, in my pocket jack, in the pockets of my jacket and I couldn't find it. So I told the lady, I said, "Look I don't have my note, but, this is proof. This is my, uhm, this is my form that proves I was at the doctor's this morning." And she looks it over and she's a new lady at the office so I thought, well, maybe I could get away with it and you know, and not have a note. And the lady, ah, the secretary, Mrs. Iverson(ph), from behind the counter goes, "No, you have to have, you have to have a note if your tardy." I went, "God." I said, "I'm at the doctor's office. I don't have the note. It might be in the car. But it's pouring down the rain out. I'm soaked. I'm late for class already." and she said, "No, you can have a note." I said, "Can't I call my mom?" And she's like, "Well, it shouldn't happen this way, Kath, you know, you're supposed to have a note on the day you come in with the tardy." I'm like, "Well, can I call, my mom call in." She's like, "You know, it's not good." I'm like, "Can my mom call in?" I asked her very calmly, holding back the aggression I had. I felt like hitting her. She said, "Alright, this time but never again, Kath." And I said, "Okay." And the lady in the office, the lady who was giving me the note was very nice and, and, and just, was just willing to help me, and this lady behind the counter, I could've killed her, you know. So anyway, so I go back and I went to the phone and I dialed mom, they put me on hold, and hold, I mean, I didn't even get elevator music, I just get put on hold with this signal. Mom comes on eventually, and says, "Oh, okay, I'll call the office. But she calls me an absent-minded senior for forgetting the note and so I get into this and I get into that. But she does call the office and lady in the office said, " Okay, she's called." And then she made a comment by saying, "Next time, I think Kathy, that, uhm, you should bring in the notes and not have your mom do all your things for you." And I walked out just in a rage. 

00:46:50
MARY B. IVEY  Concrete clients tend to talk in a very linear direction about their problems. And of course, you can hear Kathy giving great detail what happened today and all the different sequence of events that happened. And they do best with a coaching style where the, ah, counselor gives both the listening and direction. Now let's go on and hear Kathy as she talks a bit in a more formal operations way. 

00:47:20
Formal example: ability to reflect on self 

00:47:20
KATHY BOHN  I guess, as I look back on my day, Monday as it was, as it had to be, I can see myself in these situations with the secretary and, and in the office getting the note in the morning and I'm and I could see myself not blowing up and, and I was glad I didn't blow up. I got angry, I admit and was, was a bit upset but I understand where she was coming from and I, I guess I can reflect on that and say that, you know, I was glad it didn't blow up. With, with the doctor's office this morning, for instance though, I was under that much more pressure of getting the application in, make sure it got out by before the 8:30 mail. And having her tell me that I put her behind in all of what she did just it, it, it didn't, I didn't need it, you know, and I think I got a little angry at her but I think she can understand where I was coming from too. It was a rainy Monday, and I, I think that, in a Monday itself, I just, it happens. 

00:48:20
MARY B. IVEY  Formal clients are very self-reflective and you can see in this particular segment that Kathy was reflecting on her actions and her behavior. And she was beginning to see some patterns in her life. These are the clients that are easiest for us, I think, to deal with. They respond to clients and their therapy and counseling and the more cognitive types of therapy. Okay let's go on and look at the dialectic/systemic client. 

00:48:50
Dialectic/systemic example: multi-perspectives 

00:48:50
KATHY BOHN  As I look today, it was probably a very typical Monday, but, from my perspective that is, but from someone else's perspective, I, I think that, particularly the secretary in the school, I'm sure she just thinks I'm an absolute absent-minded, flustered senior, done with applications plus schoolwork and maybe kinda sees us, as kinda funny because I ran in this morning and, and it was, I was wet and I had my, barely have my application together and you know, I can understand that but and then from a, another point of view, from like, my friend's point of view, I remember she said, "Kath, you know, you gotta just take it easy and, and it's amazing you did all this much work in this one weekend. I mean, I wouldn't been able to do it." And she was almost encouraging, and that was nice because at that point, I needed it. I mean, I've been criticized by anybody else, everybody else there. There are many ways you can look at my day. And, you know, from the secretary's point of view, from my friend's point of view, and I guess if I can look it from my point of view, I also see, I also see is that at least I'm not bored. I have many things to do to occupy my time. And I guess, that's, that's all, that's often better than just doing nothing. 

00:50:20
MARY B. IVEY  Dialectic/systemic clients are the most complex. They can talk about systems of operation. And then, and you, you saw in this last tape, Kathy was able to take multiple perspectives on her particular problem. With the counselor's help, many of these people can think about themselves and the systems that they live in very effectively. 

00:50:40
Family Example 

00:50:40
MARY B. IVEY  Now let's show you a family tape. Developmental counseling and therapy can be used effectively in families. I'd like to have you analyze the cognitive-developmental level of each family member as well as the cognitive-developmental level of the family as a whole. Uhm, I'd like to thank Sandra Rigazio-Digilio, who is our therapist in this family. I think it's very important that we as therapist look at our own family as we work with developmental counseling and therapy. 

00:51:15
What level or levels are represented in this family? 

00:51:15
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO  I know that there's positive and negatives in every family. I know that, ah, it's very hard to share the, the negative, uhm, especially when your not sure who's going to see this. So that I'd like to leave the questions more open-ended. And, uhm, for the purpose of the demonstration, we'd like you to think about just by yourselves for a moment, uhm, what happens for you when you think about this family and when you think about the ways you relate you relate with one another, if you could do that alone for a minute. 

00:51:50
[sil.] 

00:51:50
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO  And while you're thinking, what I'd like to propose is that you decide together in the way that this family would decide, uhm, a particular family situation that you'll feel comfortable sharing with me and with the camera, uhm, that will allow me as an outsider to get an inside view of how the family typically works. Could you decide what situation you'd like to talk about now? Again, just the way that your family would make this decision. 

00:52:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Do we want a bad situation or do we want a good situation (laughs)? 

00:52:30
ALLEN IVEY We have both. 

00:52:30
ELIZABETH BOHN  We haven't been in a big family argument in a while because I haven't been here. So, yeah, you can exclude me if you want to 'coz I got the three of you but. (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
MARY B. IVEY Oh, I always keep thinking about Bill and John that aren't here, we have two absent, uhm, stepbrothers, half-brother, stepbrothers to Liz and Kathy. What it's really like when all, when everybody's here is when it's the best and the easiest I think when we have four kids almost. 

00:53:00
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:53:00
MARY B. IVEY Do you think sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:53:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:00
MARY B. IVEY ...when everybody's here? 

00:53:00
KATHY BOHN  See someone to talk to, you have to try to get along, talk to one... (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:05
KATHY BOHN ...and talk to another and. (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
MARY B. IVEY  That's when we have the least amount of argument. 

00:53:10
KATHY BOHN Right. The least. 

00:53:10
ALLEN IVEY Oh, yeah. 

00:53:10
MARY B. IVEY What would be a typical situation? 

00:53:15
ALLEN IVEY Oh, borrowing clothes. 

00:53:15
MARY B. IVEY (laughs) Borrowing clothes? 

00:53:20
ELIZABETH BOHN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
KATHY BOHN Okay. That's classic. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO Uh-huh. 

00:53:20
KATHY BOHN Ah, it's classic of many thing. 

00:53:20
MARY B. IVEY  Stop borrowing clothes. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO And half, and that's what's along just the four of you? 

00:53:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO That is first. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
KATHY BOHN Yes. 

00:53:25
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
ELIZABETH BOHN Yup. 

00:53:25
KATHY BOHN  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:53:30
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO So, borrowing clothes will be the example? 

00:53:30
ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ). 

00:53:33
MARY B. IVEY Is that okay? (crosstalk) 

00:53:33
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO  He has quite a strong vote in this family (inaudible ). 

00:53:37
ELIZABETH BOHN Well, he just thought of something that all of us, I didn't, I didn't thought of it but it's definitely... (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
MARY B. IVEY And there's. 

00:53:40
ELIZABETH BOHN ...a good topic and a big issue. 

00:53:45
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO Okay. 

00:53:45
MARY B. IVEY Yeah. 

00:53:45
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO All right to begin, Allen and Mary, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
MARY B. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
SANDRA RIGAZIO-DIGILIO if, if I were to ask you that you had to chose just one person out of the group of four, that observes the most closely this situation, who watches it carefully when it happens, who would that be? And I'd like the two of you to decide together who would that be. 

00:54:05
ALLEN IVEY What clothes, by the way? 

00:54:05
MARY B. IVEY Who observes it the most conflict. 

00:54:05
ALLEN IVEY  I think I do. 

00:54:10
MARY B. IVEY I think you're, I think you're (inaudible ). 

00:54:13
Post-test: Identifying Cognitive-Developmental Level 

00:54:13
MARY B. IVEY  Now, you've had several opportunities, opportunities to assess cognitive-developmental level. At this point, I'd like you to turn to looking at several brief vignettes to see if you're able to recognize the cognitive-developmental level as shown on the video tape. 

00:54:35
What level is represented by this client? 

00:54:35
ALLEN IVEY  What do you wanna do? 

00:54:40
MARY B. IVEY Okay, well, let's begin then. First of all, what happens when you focus on your family? 

00:54:50
[sil.] 

00:54:50
ALLEN IVEY  Well, they, ah, they think that, ah, the medication isn't doing me much good though. They, I just think the, the green pills, they kinda knock me, ah, I just, I just feel really I'm slow about it. 

00:55:25
What level is represented by this client? 

00:55:25
 To have you here and I really appreciate you coming. I thought we might like to talk about some, the junior high and now here you are a sixth grader and won't be long in another semester or so and you'll be off to the junior high. 

00:55:35
IMANI ROSA Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
 What comes to mind when you think about the junior high, any, any, ah, anything? (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
IMANI ROSA Like lots of homework. 

00:55:45
 Lots of homework. 

00:55:45
IMANI ROSA I might get picked on because we are the last one that's in the school. 

00:55:50
 Might, because you're the youngest in the school, you might get picked on by the older kids and homework. 

00:55:55
IMANI ROSA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
 Any other things that you think about, what do you think about the junior high? 

00:55:55
IMANI ROSA Well, maybe I won't be taking the same classes with my friends. 

00:56:00
 You're all. 

00:56:00
What level is represented by this client? 

00:56:00
MARY B. IVEY  Personally, I'm playing a very familiar role and we're just trying to keep the peace. I think I do that in my own family and I'm doing that here now, trying to keep things quiet, trying to help people get along, no arguments, uhm, I, I don't like that. I don't like conflict. 

00:56:20
ALLEN IVEY So why. 

00:56:20
What level is represented by this client? 

00:56:20
HODGES GLENN  Well, internalization appears to be one of the, ah, looking at it developmentally, ah, one of the more favorable positions because it allows you to, ah, fit yourself into a given specific situation. 

00:56:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
HODGES GLENN And use that as a model for, you know, how you think about the situation, how you behave. Uhm, for instance, ah, there are situations where maybe, more prudent to, ah, to address issues of racism. To actually ah, perhaps show, ah, force. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
HODGES GLENN  while in other situations, it maybe more warranted to, ah, take a less, uhm, say a covert or obvious or open, ah, ah, action. I think it's important like in my own personal experience, to be able to look at a situation realistically and to find options that allow you to express your identity as a person. 

00:57:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
HODGES GLENN While at the same time, realizing that there is perhaps an oppressive element out there and it maybe racial and it maybe some other factors as well. But it's up to you to be able to be, ah, open and, uhm, analytical in understanding it and then making your choices and acting on them. 

00:58:00
What LEVELS are represented by this client? 

00:58:00
HODGES GLENN  Just a bad day. I uhm, come home, ahead(ph) on too much to drink, like I usually stop off at some of the guys... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
HODGES GLENN ...and you know what I mean, tie a few on, you know, but, I can always drive home, you know. You barely(ph) have problems with that, but, uhm, got inside and can(ph) she was just after me, one thing after the other and I just, I'm still drinking at home, I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
HODGES GLENN I had beers, there... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
HODGES GLENN ...you know, some nice wines and stuffs. (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
HODGES GLENN So, and, I had a few too many to drink, particularly when I got home. 

00:58:45
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
HODGES GLENN 'Coz I just got fed up with her complaining and I've told her I'd shut her up, so I went over to her favorite vase, this vase has been with her family for years... (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:58:55
HODGES GLENN ...and I just knocked it over. 

00:59:00
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:59:00
HODGES GLENN Just knocked it over and. 

00:59:00
ELSA ORJUELA  When, when you did that, what was you feeling? 

00:59:05
HODGES GLENN It's not an anger, but, after that it was, ah, I begin, I got scared. 

00:59:15
ELSA ORJUELA You got scared. 

00:59:15
HODGES GLENN  And I was afraid that, "Oh my God, look what I did?" 

00:59:20
ELSA ORJUELA What you did, think that? 

00:59:25
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

00:59:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh. 

00:59:25
HODGES GLENN That I was friends(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
ELSA ORJUELA So, you saw a connection... (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

00:59:25
ELSA ORJUELA ...on what you're doing. 

00:59:25
HODGES GLENN Yeah, I was trying so hard not to be like him. 

00:59:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh. 

00:59:30
HODGES GLENN  But to do that, I mean, it just, it just reminded me of him. 

00:59:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

00:59:40
End Assessing Cognitive-Developmental Level DCT Systematic Questions Elsa Orjuela Hodges Glenn Allen Ivey 

00:59:40
ALLEN IVEY  DCT questioning procedures are what we're going to focus on in this tape. What you'll find that if you ask specific questions pointing around specific DCT levels, the clients will express cognitions in very, very different ways. For example, if we focus in at the sensorimotor level, as you'll see early in the next tape. You'll see clients talking about images, you find them giving much more in touch with the here and now, what's going on with them, just in the immediate experience. On the other hand, if you ask about concrete issue, you'll find them talking about linear issues in detail, kind of issues in sequence. Thirdly, if you ask for patterns, you'll find people focusing on patterns of life. Ah, in effect, what, the specific questions you asked within DC, lead to predictable results in the client. Our belief is that we need to build an adequate foundation of developmental cognitions at each level before progressing to the next. However, keep in mind while we're doing a systematic presentation in this tape, sometimes it's best to start where the client is. For example, if the client is formal in nature, it's best to start with formal operations and then move perhaps to the concrete and then later to sensorimotor functioning. It's not always necessary to go through the specific sequence that were gonna present in this tape. 

01:01:35
Opening sequence Focal question: What occurs for you when you focus on your family? 

01:01:35
ELSA ORJUELA  Good morning. 

01:01:45
HODGES GLENN Hi. 

01:01:45
ELSA ORJUELA Ah, we have met before... (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

01:01:50
ELSA ORJUELA ...and, ah, I was wondering today if, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:01:50
ELSA ORJUELA I could, ah, get a little bit of more of the history of the alcoholism, if it is okay with you? 

01:01:55
HODGES GLENN Sure. 

01:01:55
ELSA ORJUELA Yeah? 

01:01:55
HODGES GLENN  Yeah. 

01:02:00
ELSA ORJUELA Okay, all right. 

01:02:00
HODGES GLENN Well, what do you wanna know? 

01:02:00
ELSA ORJUELA Well, uhm, when, what have, what occurs for you, when, ah, you think about your family? 

01:02:10
HODGES GLENN (clears throat) I think about my family? 

01:02:10
ELSA ORJUELA  Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
HODGES GLENN Some pain and confusion. Yeah, a lot of confusion, scary, too. 

01:02:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. (crosstalk)c 

01:02:25
HODGES GLENN It's a little scary. 

01:02:25
ELSA ORJUELA  Can you tell me more about that? 

01:02:30
HODGES GLENN Sure, uhm, when I was a child, growing up, uhm, my dad drink a lot, my mom would drink sometimes, but my dad drink most of all. And, uhm, most of the time, he would come home from work or just come home very, very late at night. 

01:02:55
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:02:55
HODGES GLENN And he would be drunk, just smelling of alcohol, uhm, as soon as he walked in the door, it just went all over the house. I was upstairs in my room, most of the time in my bed. My brother and I slept in one room. 

01:03:10
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:03:10
HODGES GLENN And my sister slept in the other room and, ah, but we could smell it and I would, when he came home, I would get underneath the covers because it was just, I was scared. 

01:03:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
HODGES GLENN Big boys aren't supposed to be scared... (crosstalk) 

01:03:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh.

HODGES GLENN  And I hear him coming screaming and hollering at mom, just throwing things and then they're yelling at each other and she starts throwing things. And I just get really, really frightened and. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
ELSA ORJUELA  Uh hmm. Where did you feel the fright? 

01:05:50
HODGES GLENN (sigh) All over. I just, my body gets real stiff, you know, I start, I wanna scream out, "Mom," but I don't think she will hear me. 

01:06:00
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:00
HODGES GLENN That point my sister comes over, she grabs me by the back of my neck... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
HODGES GLENN ...and says, "Let's get out of here." 

01:06:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
HODGES GLENN Grabs me and we get all of our pillows and our stuff and on our way out, I'm crying and, uhm, I asked for my teddy, and she says "Forget your stupid teddy, let's go," and then she grabs me and run out the house and (sighs)it is just so scary, God. 

01:06:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:25
HODGES GLENN And the whole time I'm running, I'm thinking, "Why can't I have a house like Bob's? 

01:06:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
HODGES GLENN Bob's got a nice house." 

01:06:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
Focusing on the body magnifies sensori-motor feelings 

01:06:30
ELSA ORJUELA  And you said that you felt scared throughout your whole body? 

01:06:40
HODGES GLENN  Uh hmm. 

01:06:45
ELSA ORJUELA Like right now, (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
HODGES GLENN Well, I just.

01:06:55
ELSA ORJUELA Yeah. Petrified.

HODGES GLENN Not to show fear. 

01:07:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:07:05
HODGES GLENN Because, it's. (crosstalk) 

01:07:05
ELSA ORJUELA When you think about these feelings, (crosstalk) 

01:07:05
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

01:07:05
ELSA ORJUELA when you're feeling like this, just so fearful, uhm, does any color come to mind?

ELSA ORJUELA  Where are you seeing it? 

01:07:25
HODGES GLENN Just all over, just red. 'Coz I remember he, uhm, he hit my mom once and she fell and she hurt her head, he stumbled into the bedroom. And that particular day, we didn't run away, we all came down the stairs, and our mom was getting up, she was feeling the back of her head and she saw there was blood on her hand. And, and we call the hospital and they picked her up and took her in and it was just, ah, like a bump or something. 

01:07:55
Concrete example based on body feelings 

01:07:55
HODGES GLENN It wasn't really serious. But the fact that she was bleeding, and I just, (crosstalk) 

01:08:00
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh. 

01:08:00

ELSA ORJUELA when, when you're afraid. 

01:08:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm.

01:08:20
HODGES GLENN Yes(ph). 

01:08:20
ELSA ORJUELA ...you, you associate that with, with blood. 

01:08:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. I was very afraid, yeah.

01:08:45
ELSA ORJUELA  Uh hmm.

01:08:50
ELSA ORJUELA  Has there been any time, uhm. 

01:08:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm.

HODGES GLENN Well, once my girlfriend and I were fighting. I had a rough day at work and things weren't going that well. You know, I mean, work usually goes well, (crosstalk) 

01:09:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm.

01:09:35
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:09:35
HODGES GLENN ...and then tie a few on, you know, but I can always drive home, you know, I never had any problems with that. But, uhm, I got inside and okay(ph), and she was just after me, one thing after the other and I just, I was still drinking at home, I mean, (crosstalk) 

01:10:00

01:10:05
HODGES GLENN 'Coz I just got fed up with her complaining and I told her I'd shut her up, so I went over to her favorite vase, this vase has been with her family for years... (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:10:15
HODGES GLENN ...and I just knocked it over. 

01:10:20
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:10:20
HODGES GLENN Just knocked it over and. 

01:10:20
ELSA ORJUELA When, when you did that, what were you feeling? 

01:10:25
HODGES GLENN It's not anger, but, (sigh) after that it was, ah, I begin, I got scared. 

01:10:35
ELSA ORJUELA You got scared? 

01:10:35
Interview Moves to Discussion of Formal Patterns: Is this a pattern? 

01:10:35
HODGES GLENN  And I was afraid that, "Oh my, God! Look, what I did?" 

01:10:45
ELSA ORJUELA What you did? You think that? 

01:10:50
HODGES GLENN Yeah.

ELSA ORJUELA ...on what you're doing. 

01:10:50
HODGES GLENN I was trying so hard- 

01:10:55
Client sees repeating pattern 

01:10:55
HODGES GLENN - not be like him. 

01:10:55
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
HODGES GLENN  But to do that, I mean, you just, it just reminded me of him. 

01:11:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:11:05
HODGES GLENN You know, and I. 

01:11:05
ELSA ORJUELA  Uh hmm. 

01:11:10
Examining of patterns 

01:11:10
ELSA ORJUELA So, you had been telling me that, uhm. 

01:11:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:11:15

01:11:45
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

01:11:45
ELSA ORJUELA Hmm. 

01:11:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. I haven't hit her or anything like that... (crosstalk) 

01:11:45
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:11:45
HODGES GLENN ...but, and that vase was really important to her. 

01:11:50
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:11:50
HODGES GLENN You know, it just really hurt me that I would do something like that... (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
ELSA ORJUELA  Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
HODGES GLENN ...to hurt her. 

01:12:00
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:12:00
HODGES GLENN 'Coz I really- 

01:12:00
Sees family pattern 

01:12:00
HODGES GLENN - like her a lot and I think I love her, but that's something that wasn't expressed in their house either. No one said that to each other. 

01:12:10
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. So, so, you see yourself, do you, when you, when you think about you doing that... (crosstalk) 

01:12:20
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:12:20
ELSA ORJUELA ...uhm, and your father doing that, my, do you think that that might be sort of a pattern? 

01:12:30
HODGES GLENN (sigh) Yeah. 

01:12:35
ELSA ORJUELA Yeah? How do you. (crosstalk) 

01:12:35
HODGES GLENN I believe so. Well, that's not the first time that it happened. Uhm, it's happened with her before, uhm, I think that's the worst it's been. 

01:12:50
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:12:50
HODGES GLENN You know, but I definitely have too much to drink and a fight will start. And she'll end up storming to her bedroom and I'll sleep on the coach and, 'coz I'm too drunk to drive at that point or she takes the keys away, anyway... (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
HODGES GLENN ...so I couldn't do it. 

01:13:10
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. So you, so you get, you get drunk and then you, you... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:13:15
ELSA ORJUELA ...start into a fight with her. 

01:13:15
HODGES GLENN Yeah. 

01:13:15
ELSA ORJUELA You get very angry and, and... (crosstalk) 

01:13:15
HODGES GLENN  Uh hmm. 

01:13:20
ELSA ORJUELA ...and perhaps somewhat violent. (crosstalk) 

01:13:20
HODGES GLENN You know, hmm, I haven't been violent with her, but we would just get loud... (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:13:25
HODGES GLENN ...and threatening. (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:13:25
HODGES GLENN You know, I threaten. At least, she says I do. 

01:13:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
HODGES GLENN I don't recall at all, a lot. 

01:13:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
Dialectic/Systemic Questioning: Examining patterns and systems and moving to action. 

01:13:30
ELSA ORJUELA  Well, we'd have been talking about, uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:13:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
ELSA ORJUELA your, your perspective on, on, what it is like for you to be, to have had come from a family where your father was alcoholic... (crosstalk) 

01:13:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:13:50
ELSA ORJUELA ...and you seemed to have been, uhm, also doing that now in your present life. 

01:13:55
HODGES GLENN Right. 

01:13:55
ELSA ORJUELA Okay. 

01:13:55
Search for multi-perspectives 

01:13:55
ELSA ORJUELA And I was just wondering what, uhm, if were, we were to take a different... (crosstalk) 

01:14:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:05
ELSA ORJUELA ...way of looking at it, what would it be like, if, if you were to look at it from your girlfriend's perspective, in your behavior. (crosstalk) 

01:14:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:15
ELSA ORJUELA What, what, what would she, how would she describe it or what will she say about it? 

01:14:20
HODGES GLENN  Hmm. She'd be angry, angry, I mean. (crosstalk) 

01:14:30
ELSA ORJUELA But what would she be angry about? 

01:14:30
HODGES GLENN 'Coz of my drinking, uhm, angry that I can't control it. She says she loves me. 

01:14:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:14:40
HODGES GLENN  Uhm, that she could marry me but not my drinking. 

01:14:50
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
HODGES GLENN That's got to stop. 

01:14:50
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. Is she angry at you because you can't control it or is she angry at... (crosstalk) 

01:14:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:14:55
ELSA ORJUELA  something else? 

01:15:00
HODGES GLENN (sigh) Well, I think she's angry at me because I can't control it. That's what I think. Uhm, I say I can't contro, that I can control it. 

01:15:10
ELSA ORJUELA That you can. 

01:15:10
HODGES GLENN  Yeah, I say I can, but... (crosstalk) 

01:15:15
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh. 

01:15:15
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:15:15
ELSA ORJUELA But? (crosstalk) 

01:15:15
HODGES GLENN We had a number of incidence... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:15:20
HODGES GLENN ...and with the vase being broken, that made me think that maybe I should continue to get help and, ah, because I, I don't wanna lose her. 

01:15:35
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:15:35
HODGES GLENN Ah. 

01:15:35
ELSA ORJUELA  So you, you, you came to realize that, that, that you might not be able to control it. 

01:15:45
HODGES GLENN Right. 

01:15:45
Moving knowledge to action: note generally concrete thought on part of client 

01:15:45
ELSA ORJUELA  And you want to do something about that? 

01:15:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Because it makes her happy. 

01:15:55
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:15:55
HODGES GLENN And, ah, I think it would make me happy, too, and I wouldn't be like my dad because he never got help. 

01:16:05
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. So, so this is something new. (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ELSA ORJUELA Your father never did and you are really attempted to do this. 

01:16:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ELSA ORJUELA To help yourself... (crosstalk) 

01:16:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ELSA ORJUELA ...and then to have some control over this. 

01:16:15
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:15
ELSA ORJUELA Hmm. That's wonderful. (crosstalk) 

01:16:15
HODGES GLENN Yeah(ph). Thanks. 

01:16:20
ELSA ORJUELA Is there any, any particular thing that you would like to begin to do? 

01:16:25
HODGES GLENN Hmm. There are so many things. 

01:16:30
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. Just one. 

01:16:30
HODGES GLENN Just one? (laughs) 

01:16:30
ELSA ORJUELA Yes, for now. 

01:16:35
Magical thinking still remains 

01:16:35
HODGES GLENN Well, hmm, I could stop drinking. 

01:16:40
ELSA ORJUELA  But that has been part of the problem that you don't know how to stop it, (crosstalk) 

01:16:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
ELSA ORJUELA or can't control it. 

01:16:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
ELSA ORJUELA How would you, ah, I want you to think about something that you would like to begin to do. 

01:16:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:16:55
ELSA ORJUELA Not, not necessarily control the drinking, but something that, uhm. 

01:17:00
HODGES GLENN  Okay. 

01:17:05
ELSA ORJUELA That you can do differently. 

01:17:05
HODGES GLENN Okay. 

01:17:05
Concrete/formal 

01:17:05
HODGES GLENN One thing I could do is I could talk to her more because when I come home and I'm angry even when I'm sober, I don't talk, I keep it inside. 

01:17:20
ELSA ORJUELA Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
HODGES GLENN You know, and, ah, she's always willing to listen. 

01:17:30
ELSA ORJUELA Can you talk? (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
HODGES GLENN Just talk to her. (crosstalk) 

01:17:30
ELSA ORJUELA Can you talk? 

01:17:30
HODGES GLENN  Yeah.

01:17:35
HODGES GLENN We, of, definitely, I mean... (crosstalk) 

01:17:35
ELSA ORJUELA Is it very difficult. 

01:17:35
HODGES GLENN ...no one talked when I was growing up. 

01:17:40
ELSA ORJUELA Uh-huh, Uh-huh. 

01:17:40
Family history continues 

01:17:40
ELSA ORJUELA So when you. (crosstalk) 

01:17:40
HODGES GLENN I mean, he yelled and screamed at us. 

01:17:45
ELSA ORJUELA I see, so you don't know how to do that or is it very difficult for you to do that... (crosstalk) 

01:17:45
HODGES GLENN Yeah. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:17:50
ELSA ORJUELA Okay. 

01:17:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:17:50
ELSA ORJUELA So and, and what would you, would like to do is that, you can talk when you come in drank or sober that, that instead of getting angry and violent... (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

01:17:55
ELSA ORJUELA ...that you're, that somehow you're able to talk to her. 

01:18:00
HODGES GLENN Yeah, how I feel. (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
ELSA ORJUELA About how you feeling. Uh-huh. 

01:18:00
HODGES GLENN (inaudible ). 

01:18:04
ELSA ORJUELA So would you like to work on that? 

01:18:05
HODGES GLENN Sure, yeah. 

01:18:05
ELSA ORJUELA Okay, I think I can help you do that. 

01:18:15

ALLEN IVEY  Elsa and Hodges have demonstrated the four aspects of developmental therapy. We should also say that a standard cognitive developmental interviews suggest that you go through eight specific stages. And we find that really going to this interview in depth, takes about an hour and a half and, ah, keep in mind that it doesn't always work as fast as you've seen here. We tried to truncate short segments to highlight the main points. And finally, of course, that critical issue when you're working with alcoholism, you need a willing client to look at him or herself. In your own role-plays, try to find issues that are real to you, that you're willing to share and see what happens to you as you go through these various stages of the interview. We think they're really important.
