Exploring the Emotions of White Racism and Antiracism Lisa B. Spanierman, Ph.D. McGill University 

00:00:45
RIDDY(PH) SANDAL(PH) My name is Riddy(ph) Sandal(ph). I'm a faculty member here at Teachers College and it is my pleasure to introduce today a speaker, Dr. Lisa Spanierman. Dr. Spanierman obtained her doctorate from the University of Missouri and is Associate Professor in the Department of educational and counseling psychology at McGill University. She also serves as the Director of Gardner(ph) Residents Hall at McGill. Dr. Spanierman's research focuses on white individuals, racial attitudes, developing white racial justice allies, and racial micro-aggressions towards divisible(ph) minorities and aboriginals(ph) in Canada. Presently she serves on the editorial boards of The Journal of Counseling Psychology and The Journal of Diversity and Higher Education. Dr. Spanierman served as a tri-chair of the Society of Counseling Psychologies, taking action again racism in higher education special task group, and currently is the organization's vice-president for scientific affairs. She obtained her Master's degree from Teacher's College in 1997 and is delighted to deliver a talk at the place that sparked her interest in the study of racism. Please join me in extending a warm welcome to Dr. Lisa Spanierman.

Emotions Of Racism And Antiracism Lisa Beth Spanierman, PhD McGill 

00:02:10
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Good morning. Thank you so much for that introduction and I just wanna extend a thank you to Marine(ph) Navil(ph) and the conference organizers for inviting me to give a talk here today. It really is very special for me to come home and come back to my very first professional conference in 1996, where I served as a student volunteer helping to introduce speakers and force people to write evaluations and those kinds of things. So it's really great. The other aspect, I was trying to think about what part of my work do I wanna present. And I'm really presenting where my research program's going, synthesizing some of the work that I've done and also, um, a way that I'm expanding outward in the future. And this work on the emotions of racism in many ways is inextricably intertwined with Teacher's College and the Winter Roundtable. And part of that is, um, having been a survivor of Robert Carter's race lab, and for folks that know about that, um, it's really helped to shape the way I think about reality, changed a lot of things. Um. Another person I want to acknowledge who's in the audience is Diane Goodman, and I'm so fortunate that she's here because I attended a talk of hers in 1998. I was flanked by Punky(ph) and Mary(ph) Hepner(ph). We were at a workshop here at the Roundtable, and she was talking about educating, um, privileged group members about diversity, social justice, and oppression. And it had such a remarkable impact on me that I looked at Punky(ph) and Mary(ph) and said, dissertation topic? And they were like, uh, scale development. Because that's what we do at Missouri. So. Um. That really sparked a lot of what I've been doing. So I'm just so thankful to be presenting at the 30th Annual Honoring The Legacy, because so many people have been so instrumental in my professional development, and it's just truly an honor to be here. Um. I also want to thank Deril(ph) Whing(ph) Sue(ph) who's a prof. here because he's been incredibly supportive of my work during the last ten years and really helped me in terms of how I'm thinking and, in this future direction. And then somebody who's not a psychologist, but rather a sociologist, Joe Phagan(ph) at Texas A&M. Um. He could be, in my mind, he's the premiere thinker about racism in the United States. He did a keynote one year and I got to know him, and he was the one who's encouraging me to expand out, to think about a taxonomy and a theory of the emotions of racism and antiracism, and he's invited me to write a book for one of his series. So I told some folks already but I, I hope to not cut into anybody's lunch time, and I hope to really have an engaging Q and A because I'm interested in your comments as I'm thinking about developing these ideas. 

00:05:15
Overview Rationale 

00:05:20
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN What I'm gonna talk about today, and where I'm gonna go, is I'm gonna provide a rational, why should we care about the emotions of racism and antiracism? 

00:05:30
The Emotions of White Racism 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN The I'm gonna start with this developing taxonomy and talk first about the emotions of racism. 

00:05:35
White Fear White Rage White Guilt & Shame 

00:05:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN White fear, white rage, white guilt and shame are some that I'll feature. There are more, but here's only so much you can do in a 50 minute talk. 

00:05:50
White Empathy: A Bridge Emotion The Emotions of White Antiracism 

00:05:50
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And I also wanna talk about white empathy as a bridge emotion from racism to antiracism. 

00:05:55
Implications 

00:05:55
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And then finally I'll talk a little bit about implications for diversity education. And that's also a direction where I'm taking my work. I think it's really crucial, um, at this stage. I'm trying to think about how can science inform policy or practice? And for me right now, the practice is, uh, to find ways to assist diversity educators in the classroom who often times are under assault. So in terms of the rationale, I think back to one fo my first classes at Teacher's College in 1995. It was Robert Carter's class before the race lab. That was a two-course series, and it was on racism and mental health. And I remember thinking, I've been in therapy, I know myself, I can do all of this, and I got into that classroom and it just turned my world upside down. And what I had realize was I hadn't thought about myself as a person with a race until I had this wonderful interaction with Professor Carter. And it was very humbling to realize that there was this tremendous aspect of myself that I had, um, been unaware of. And through the course I tried to engage, I took some fo the risks that Melba(ph) Vasques(ph) was talking about in the keynote and made a lot of mistakes. But I'll never forget at this one point, I, I don't even know what the topic was. Most topics were very provocative to me and other white folks in the room at the time, and this one white man, Master's student like myself, just stood up and raised his hands and said, I can't take this shit anymore, and stormed out of the room. And I thought, wow that's what I wanna study. That's really cool. And it really started me thinking about how emotions are a really crucial part of particularly how anyone responds to racism, but in particular how whit folks respond to racism. 

00:07:55
Rationale Emotions are central to how race is experienced in the United States 

00:08:00
 Scholars have talked about, um, how emotions are central to how race is experience din the United States, and now that I've been in Canada in two years I can say the same things there, although the white folks there think racism is south of the border in Canada. I mean, in the US. But it's not. Um. 

00:08:20
Emotions have important consequences for White people's behaviors 

00:08:20
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Emotions have important consequences for White people's behaviors. And when I'm thinking about the classroom setting, I'm thinking about cognitive load. And when white students are so mired down in strong emotional responses, they don't have the cognitive space or energy to process the information that we're teaching them. And it's not just, um, psychologists and diversity educators teaching this kind of material. My partner's a professor of American Indian Studies. He has no training in group dynamics or group facilitation or how to respond to emotions. And so when he's teaching about concepts like genocide and the residential boarding schools, the white students have very, very strong emotional reactions. Often times the white men are sitting in the classroom like this, they're completely disengaged, people shut down. At times when he was a professor at University of Kansas he received death threats. So this is really serious stuff. And I feel that as psychologists and educators we have a real opportunity to help our colleagues in racialized community studies and ethnic studies programs, um, with some of our skills, how to help in the classroom. 

00:09:30
Emotions are vital to social justice education and the development of racial justice allies 

00:09:35
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Uh. Emotions are vital to social justice education and the development of racial justice allies. Um Robert Reason(ph) has a couple of special issues in higher ed journals, talking about this kind of thing, and Diane Goodman's work speaks to this as well. 

00:09:50
Many educators are not trained to recognize or respond to emotions in the classroom 

00:09:50
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And as I mentioned before, many educators aren't trained to even recognize emotions in the classroom, let alone respond to them effectively. And because of that, they may encounter obstacles when doing this kind of teaching. And for any of you that are on tenure track, and your assistant professor's teaching these kinds of courses, you know your teaching evaluations are going to suffer and you might start struggling with questions of, am I incompetent? Or feeling overwhelmed. Or these kinds of things. So. That's why its important to study the emotions of racism and ultimately what I'd like to do in the book project is develop a grounded(ph) theory of the emotions of racism that could really inform educational settings. 

00:10:30
White Fear "Fear is a powerful emotion, one that immobilizes, traps words in our throats, and stills our tongues...when we are afraid it seems that we cannot think, we cannot speak, we cannot move" Beverly Tatum (1997, p. 194) 

00:10:35
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And there's a quote from, um, Beverly Tatum that really speaks to one of the aspects of white fear that I've been examining. And it's, fear is a powerful emotion, one that immobilizes, traps words in our throats, and stills our tongues...when we are afraid it seems that we cannot think, we cannot speak, we cannot move. And she was really talking about white students in the classes that she teaches around racism and psychology. And white students so fearful of appearing racist that they can't function in the classroom. And I think that's something really critical that we have to think about. There are many aspects of white fear. 

00:11:15
Fear of What? 

00:11:15
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN So fear of what? 

00:11:20
Fear of learning the truth 

00:11:20
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Fear of learning the truth about racism, genocide, on the foundational elements on which the United States was built. James Loen's(ph) book Lies My Teacher Told Me is indirect, um, contrast exposing the myths that, um, many of us are taught, and most of us that would argue in the US and Canadian education systems, to, um, think that we're a democratic, fair, just, um, uh, nation, uh, based on meritocracy(ph), and that's not true at all. So there's a lot of fear about that. 

00:11:50
Fear of losing privilege 

00:11:50
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Fear of losing privilege. And I think that, um, Dr. Vasques(ph) talked about that this morning when she was saying, anxiety sometimes can be a bad thing when leaders of color or white women step into positions of power, uh, there could be backlash. She was talking about that, sometimes, uh, people's fear and anxiety about what could happen creates some kind of response that makes it untenable to work in those systems. 

00:12:20
Fear and mistrust of People of Color 

00:12:20
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN A lot of my work based on that scale that I developed from my dissertation, focused on fear and mistrust of people of color. And this is an irrational fear. And kind of the typical example that I'll talk about with my student si class is, when white women are walking down the street, and there's a black or Latino man, and clutching the purse, crossing the street. And what I'm always trying to encourage them to think about is, okay, first you think about how you feel crossing the street. But try to think about what it feels like to be the black or Latino man who's experiencing people clutching and running and hiding every time he walks by, and what that might be about. 

00:13:00
Fear of appearing racist or offending others 

00:13:00
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Fear of appearing racist, and that was Beverly Tatum's quote earlier, which could be paralyzing the classroom. 

00:13:05
Fear of facing one's own racism 

00:13:05
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Fear of facing one's own racism. And I could really talk about this personally because that's the process that I had to engage in Robert Carter's year long series. In terms of really seeing that I was socialized in a racist system, and even though I've been studying this and educating a lot of my life's energy to this area since 1995 when I first sat in Professor Carter's class, I still have a lot of racist cobwebs. I'm still undoing this all of the time, unlearning, and I'm still bombarded by racist and misogynistic(ph) messages all the time, every day, as all of us are in US society. 

00:13:45
Fear of a revolution by People of Color 

00:13:50
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And then, I haven't really studied this one so much yet, but it came out in some qualitative data, and it's essentially fear of the revolution. White folks are expressing really being afraid. In the states it tends to be that black people are gonna just step up and take over, and I guess we kinda saw that for folks who saw Jango a little bit. It's kinda tapping into some of that white fear of the revolution. Although my friends who are African American Studies scholars have their critique of that film, I think there are some positive points as well. We can talk about that later Kevin(ph). 

00:14:25
White Rage 

00:14:25
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN The next emotion that I want to touch on briefly is white rage. 

00:14:30
Frustration 

00:14:30
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And this could range from just a simple frustration, as talked about by my colleagues Michael Dandria(ph) and Judy Daniels(ph). 

00:14:40
Anger and hostility 

00:14:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN To anger and hostility and racial resentment. And the picture I'm showing here many of you will be familiar with is, uh, the white woman, Hazel Bryan, jeering at Elizabeth Eckford, um, right around the time when Little Rock Central High School was being integrated. And that's a very classic picture. But looking at her face, and really thinking about white rage and white anger and white racial resentment, I think that picture really embodies it. Um. There's a lot. There are recent books, uh, about their relationship. They've been on Oprah together, it's an interesting story, I don't really have time to talk about it that much here. But what Diane Goodman wrote about in her book that was published in 2001, is that sometimes white fear manifests as white rage, so to really think about the intersections of those. So when I'm afraid, instead of confronting my own fear and dealing the feeling os anxiety, perhaps I start lashing out at others and could do some very, very harmful things. Anger and hostility. A lot of times, um, white rage has been written about with regard to white suprematists or people on the far, uh, Neo-nazi kinda white folks. But I'm really trying to expand the idea of this to, it's everyday white folks like myself who have been taught to experience white rage. Often times we see it as this idea of white victimization. Like white's have it worse now. Look at what Affirmative Action's doing. And of course, white women are the biggest beneficiary of Affirmative Action, but we're not taught to know that. We think, um, black people, Latino people, American Indian people,a re taking our slots(ph) and jobs and things like that. And, um, when I do res, qualitative research with white folks, especially white students cuz that's the population I'm interested in, I'll always ask them, well what's an example of that? When has that happened? And they can never draw on one. Or they'll say, there's so many scholarships at the University of Illinois where i Was on the faculty for eight years. So many scholarships for students of color but nothing for me. And I said, really? Let's take a look about, you know, where, where are all these scholarships? And we never really can find that many. So it's really quite interesting. And there's just a lot of mythology around Affirmative Action. I'm doing some research now. A couple of my students are here from Canada. I'm just delighted that they made the far trip. You can just wave so folks will say hi to you and, we know Canadians are so nice. So. Um. But we're doing some work there among aboriginal students in Canada. And one of the themes that came up when we were researching the racial micro-aggressions there, is this withstanding jealous accusations, which sounds very similar to the backlash against Affirmative Action in the states. So students are saying to them things like, well you've got this unfair tax break. You don't have to pay tuition. And there's no understanding of what the rules really are, and there's clearly no understanding of the historical context in which some of these practices and policies may be put in place, and how they hardly make a dent in rectifying the trauma, um, of the past. And we did a study in Illinois, um, at University of Illinois that we published in 2011 in Journal of Diversity and Higher Education. We analyzed web log data and this was after our racist, um, athletic mascot, Chief Illiniwek,was retired. And my partner, Tony, was just always reading these web blogs. And as you might imagine it was, um, quite painful for him to read it. And I think one of the things that Dr. Vasques was talking about this morning was really turning your pain into action. So we really talked about, what are some things we can do? And we said, oh, we, let's research it. So we had a thousand pages of web log data. 

00:18:35
"Native Americans should just shut up and fiddle their little hands with glee that a university decided to abuse them. Damn the Natives..." Anonymous participant (Clark et al. 2011) 

00:18:35
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And this is just one quote that I think really features the, the white rage. Native Americans should just shut up and fiddle their little hands with glee that a university decided to abuse them. Damn the Natives. And we read a thousand pages of things like this. It was really quite fascinating. I think, um, using the web log approach, you capture some things that many people may not say in a face to face interview. Some people still say it but, um, many folks won't. White guilt has been an emotion has been an emotion that I've been researching quite a bit over the last ten years. And it's very, very complex. 

00:19:15
White Guilt Nature of White guilt depends on the context 

00:19:15
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN One thing that I want to note is it actually depends on the context. And what I'm talking about here is I have a study that we published in 2006 where we looked at types that cluster certain emotions together. And when white guilt is coupled with white empathy, which I'll talk about later, it;s quite different that when white guilt is coupled with white fear. So for example, sometimes I would, at Illinois, I would take, um, undergraduate students from, uh, theories(ph) class that I taught into my research lab. And they knew we were studying whiteness, white racism, and white privilege. But when they would get in there, uh, things would happen. Sometimes they'd come in wearing the Chief Illiniwek shirt and before I even had a chance to say anything, my graduate students would school them on why that was inappropriate and how that was racist. Um. And other things that would happen is they'd be reading books like Silent Racism and understanding how they too were well meaning whites who were perpetrating micro-aggressions, essentially on a daily basis. And there was a lot of fear. I had several students over the years, maybe second or third year white undergrads, come to my office hours shaking and saying, now that I'm learning this, I can't walk down the street anymore when I see a group of black students or Latino students, I think that they're just seeing my privilege all over me and just seeing me and just trembling. And I said, I think you need to go to counseling. I think you need to work on this a bit. And another interesting thing that I found out is that in a study that I published in The Counseling Psychologist in 2008, the, the few white folks who are actually doing the right thing. The white students who have a strong antiracist orientation. So for example, this one young woman, both of her parents were attorneys, but they chose to work as civil rights attorneys. They could have had high power corporate jobs. They chose to live in a black community on the south side of Chicago, and that's where this young woman was raised. So she was always raised among black folks. She didn't really have many white friends. And she was a strong social justice advocate. She drives a 120 miles south, comes to Champaign-Urbana(ph), and she's sitting in classes that's a predominately white, land grant institution, or as Tony would call it, a historically white university. And, she's hearing these white students who have no clue, and she's so embarrassed when they're saying things and she finds herself constantly in the role of educator or debater, and it's very, very frustrating for her. So she's isolated from the white students. Then we find that, when she reaches out to the black students on campus, they don't know her history. They don't know about her, so she's isolated from them. And when I wa-, I spent a day, or a half a day walking around campus to try to find resources for her. Of course, as a good counseling psychologist, I went to the counseling center. I went to the program on intergroup relations. I went all kinds of places, and there was really nothing to help this student. And I'm thinking, something's wrong here, because this young woman's doing all the right things. This is how we want out white students to be. And we have no resources for her. So. That's kind of tangential from my white guilt, but I was just thinking about her. Um. 

00:22:30
Important part of the process for White individuals to become racially conscious 

00:22:35
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Janet Helms, Beverly Tatum, and scores of other folks really talk about how white guilt is an important part of the process for white individuals to become racially conscious. So in the white racial identity development model, for example, this is captured in that disintegration status. And it's really crucial in some ways. But what I'll talk about later is the anecdotal literature. Not the science literature, but the other literature and popular media really talks about white guilt as something debilitating. Something that we have to move our white students through quickly, or even something used by, you know, president Obama to force white people to do something as a manipulative tool. 

00:23:15
Linked to cultural competence and social justice action 

00:23:15
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN But actually, the research has found that it's linked to multicultural competence. I have a study in The Journal of Counseling Psychology in 2008 that shows that connection. 

00:23:25
Promoting an apology 

00:23:25
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And then a group of social psychologist, Iyer Leach and Crosby and Iyer Leach and Peterson, have done some work showing that it's linked to promoting an apology, which an apology is not everything, but it's a start. And in Canada for example, um, the government's apologized for the residential schools. Doesn't mean that they've solved everything and there's no racism toward aboriginal folks and the disparities, um, are now rectified. Of course not. But at least an apology's an acknowledgment. We don't even have that in the states, and most of us grow up not even knowing about the horrors of the residential boarding schools. 

00:24:00
Supporting compensatory efforts 

00:24:05
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And it's also linked to support for Affirmative Action and the kinds of things I was talking about earlier. So when I've been thinking about white guilt lately I'm really thinking it's very, very complex and very nuanced and that there are productive aspects of guilt and maladaptive aspects of guilt. And this is something I'm gonna be working more and I'll be curious to hear from folks who've spent a lot fo time doing diversity education with white students. There's kind of a funny story about the criticism of white guilt. I have a colleague, he teaches in the honors college at University of Arizona, and his partner's a counseling psychologist. And he's in American Studies, which my partner's in, so we have a lot in common. His name's Pat Grzanka and he was presenting a poster at an APA on white guilt. And he was really critiquing some of the oversimplification in some of my earlier work around the scale, which was, um, a set conflating, he said, white guilt and white shame. But I just decided to mess with him a little and I turned my nametag around and went up to his poster and let him kind of talk me through it. An, um, it was very, very helpful for me, because I think had he seen that I was one of the folks, he wasn't only critiquing me, and in other fields outside of counseling psychology, people are a bit harsher with their critique, and I really wanted all of it because that's hoe science improves. And he gave me really good critique. We're very close friends now, and I have a lot of respect for his work. Um. He worked with Ruth Fassinger a little bit at the University of Maryland as well. 

00:25:35
Criticism of guilt In the anecdotal literature, White guilt is seen as negative--something that Whites must work through 

00:25:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN So guilt is, um, seen as something negative in the anecdotal literature. 

00:25:45
White guilt may re-center Whiteness 

00:25:45
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Some scholars say that it actually may recenter whiteness int he classroom and take the focus off people of color or take the focus off racist systems and institutions. So that's something that educators need to be very careful about. 

00:26:00
White guilt is a middle-class emotion 

00:26:00
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN White guilt's been critiqued as a middle-class emotion, and that it's seen much less often among working class whites. And I'm glad that Will Lou(ph) is int he audience cuz he's editing a text, an Oxford handbook, that's coming out on social class and counseling psychology, and my partner Pat Gariet(ph) and I contributed a chapter where we're looking at the intersection of social class and whiteness. And I can't remember how much we talked about guilt in there. 

00:26:25
White guilt has been conflated with shame 

00:26:30
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Um. And then of course Pat Grzanka's critique that white guilt has been conflated with shame. So I did a lot of thinking and reading about this, and a really helpful book is, um, this woman, uh, a minister, Tandeka(ph) wrote a really compelling book about white folks, um, and really features white shame. 

00:26:50
Shame is related to feeling worthless, powerless, & unlovable. Shame involves negative evaluation of one's whole being; guilt is linked to a particular behavior. Whereas guilt may motivate reparative action, shame does not appear to do so. 

00:26:50
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN But shame more so is related to feeling worthless, powerless, & unlovable. It involves a negative evaluation of one's whole being whereas guilt is linked to a particular behavior or a series of behaviors. And guilt, as I mentioned before from the social psychologists' work, is linked to a reparative action, whereas shame doesn't appear to be linked in that way. So I think with quantitative research, for those of you that do quant research, there are some limits. And this may be one of the limits of my earlier studies. But now we're doing a lot of qualitative research in the lab, and I think we can unearth some of the nuances and complexities around white guilt that could be more helpful to educators in the future. Now I wanna introduce white empathy. And I'm really referring to this as a bridge emotion, and a bridge between white racism and white antiracism. And many diversity educators will talk about the importance of fostering white empathy among students. What I'm finding in my quant and qualitative is that, white empathy is necessary but not sufficient. So for example, I'll have white student sin my classes, undergrad who would say things like, I feel horrible that racism exists. I feel really bad that it's so unfair for people of color. By the way, I didn't have slaves, my parents didn't have slaves, my grandparents didn't have slaves, nobody in my family had slaves. So they somehow remove themselves from understanding that. Um. 

00:28:25
White empathy Refers to understanding the pain that People of Color experience as a result of racial oppression. 

00:28:25
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN The way that I've conceptualize white empathy is that is refers to an understanding of the pain and suffering that folks of color experience as a result of white supremacy and racial oppression. 

00:28:35
Operationalized as anger and sadness about racism 

00:28:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN I've operationalized it as anger and sadness about racism in my scale, which is pretty limited. My colleague Eway(ph) Wang(ph) and, um, some of her colleagues, she's a, uh, Southern Illinois University, she developed a scale of ethno-cultural empathy. And I've been using that in some of my work as well, which picks up on some different dimensions of empathy. My research has shown a lot of positive associations of this small measure of white empathy. 

00:29:05
Racial Awareness Cultural Sensitivity Diversity Appreciation Multicultural Education Racially Diverse Friends 

00:29:10
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN In terms of being linked to higher levels racial awareness or, which translate to lower levels of colorblind racial attitudes, high cultural sensitivity, higher diversity appreciation, greater multicultural education, and more racially diverse friends. And in a lot of my research I'm finding out that cross racial friendships are very, very important to college and university white students in terms of shifting their racial attitudes. I also wanna draw briefly on, um, Joe Feagin and Hernan Vera's work from their book, originally published in 1995, White Racism: The Basics. 

00:29:45
Stages of WHITE EMPATHY Autopathy Empathy Sympathy 

00:29:45
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And Joe Feagin's work is just amazing, but he's talked about sympathy as the most limited stage where white folks develop a passing interest in the lives of racialized people. There's nothing long standing to that. He talks about empathy as more consistent and a more developed ability to understand racialized individuals' feelings. And you can see how actual real friendships and connections could foster that. And then autopathy, where white individuals deliberately place themselves in situations to gain a first hand feeling of what it's like to be oppressed. This is not to say that I could ever know what it's like, um, to go out and hail a cab as a person of color in New York, or to know these kinds of things, but I think that white, that young white woman that I talked about earlier who grew up in the south side of Chicago, she was arrested by the police for just hanging out with her black friends. So on a certain level, she was able to understand that, um, as a kind of a guilt by association she called it, um, racial profiling. She got it a little bit more than most of us get it as white folks. So I think, um, I'm just gonna lead us now to the emotions of white antiracism. And unfortunately my colleague Laura Smith from Teacher's College isn't here, but I'm really trying to feature a lot of the work that, um, she did. And she published a paper in 2010. Smith and Redington(ph). 

00:31:15
Emotions of White antiracism The journey from racism to antiracism is painful 

00:31:15
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN But one of the things that she and others who study white antiracism are talking about is, yes the journey is very, very painful from racism to antiracism. It, it comprises all of these emotions that we just talked about and it's really having an honest confrontation with one's own racism to get through it. The only way through the pain is into it. 

00:31:35
Moral outrage 

00:31:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And this could also be expressed as having some moral outrage, which I see among some of my students, white students, as their learning about the existence of white supremacy and the foundations and structures in the United States and Canada. And what's different about moral outrage and guilt is there's no self blame. There's responsibility and accountability but not blame. And that might be part of the nuances around guilt. 

00:32:05
Feelings of joy on the other side 

00:32:05
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN But what Laura and her colleagues found, um, in their, they conducted a qualitative study among 18 white antiracists, is that there actually are feelings of joy on the other side. And I think, I can't remember the name of it, I think it's called Mirrors of Privilege. Also a film, uh, a documentary that really features white antiracists and I think it taps into some of the joy that these folks experience. 

00:32:30
Sense of integrity Peace of mind Compassion Joy Hope 

00:32:30
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And this could be around a sense of integrity, authenticity, pleasure, relief, uh, peace of mind in the sense of moral fulfillment, compassion, a joyful feeling of connection to humanity and hope. Hope for future generation. Hope for a better world with less racism and greater humanity for all. And I'm just gonna end with just some real brief implications for diversity educators, since I've told you earlier that's the whole point of why I'm trying to think about this and dot he work. 

00:33:05
Implications for diversity educators 1. We must prepare White students for experiencing a range of emotions 

00:33:10
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN But I think that we prepare white students in our courses for experiencing a range of emotions as they come into contact, um, with the horrific atrocities that have been committed. Um. Historically, but also today. These things are still going on. I know that I've taken more of a historical approach when I've been talking about it, but it doesn't take much to just open up the news to look at the news in Indian country, to look at, um, even the New York Times and see the kinds of things that are happening today. 

00:33:40
2. Educators must be aware that strong emotional responses could interfere with ability to process info 

00:33:40
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN Educators must be aware that strong emotional responses could interfere with students' ability to process information. So this would be a good thig tot alk about with the white administrator who doesn't get multicultural education. Doesn't get why it's so difficult. But to be able to actually show data, show studies that explain, well I can't even achieve me learning outcomes in the class because these emotions get in the way and I need additional support. I need a TA. I need a TA who's from social work, counseling psychology, or some related filed who can help me manage the group dynamics in the classroom. And we did try this in my partner's American Indian Studies 101 class. One of my white graduate students, who had completed her undergrad at Illinois and really could relate with the white students in the class, she went in and just agave a brief talk about, you know, I know you just saw such and such film, and I know it was very, very emotional, and I know lots of you may be grappling with emotional issues. And she spoke for a half hour and she and my partner Tony got tons of positive feedback, and students reached out to Kathy to follow up and process and talk through some of their feelings. And I know when I was a student in Robert Carter's first class, in that large class of 80 people in a lecture hall, he had us in break out groups and they were racialized breakout groups. And I was so mad that I was in the white group. I didn't wanna be in the white group. And I was thinking, why is he doing this to me? This is horrible. But I realize now, there's something really important about having a space with other white folks for me to air, uh, my ugliest thoughts and feelings and process them with other people. And that, that may not be possible when I'm in, um, groups that are racially mixed. Or it may be very hurtful for other people, and why should I subject them to that? So a lot fo what we're doing now, we have a paper that's coming out in 2013 looking at, um, intergroup dialogue courses. This actually was a student's undergraduate thesis where he interviewed white students to really find out that maybe a technique for them is having them in these white affinity groups first to really talk through some stuff and then, when they develop a level of readiness to connect with folks of color. 

00:36:00
White faculty must take responsibility for teaching White students about racism and White privilege 

00:36:00
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN white faculty must take responsibility for teaching white students about racisms and white privilege. It's not fair for us to put this work on the shoulders of our colleagues of color. They have enough to deal with at universities and institutions that are working against them in many ways, and I think white folks, we have to take a responsibility to step up and do this work. 

00:36:20
University personnel should create settings that foster meaningful friendships across differences 

00:36:25
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN University personnel, and I'm sure there are some in the room, we need to think not only about academic, um, connections and curriculum, these kinds of things, but also ways to foster settings, um, to create setting that foster meaningful cross-racial friendships. And as a residence hall director, I have no idea why I'm doing it. My students know it's like really taking a lot out of me but I really wanted to learn on the ground. What's going on with these undergrads and their, I live with them. So I live with 221 18 years olds. And you can feel my pain for that. But I think I see how important these friendships are, and I'm trying to think of ways that I can foster some of these connections in my own residence hall in Gardner Hall. 

00:37:05
Need additional research to identify effective interventions among White students 

00:37:10
DR. LISA SPANIERMAN And then finally, we need additional research, so for the research in the audience we really need to find out ways to disrupt white fear, to promote white empathy, and to promote moral outrage. Something that we need more of, Robert Jensen at University of Texas Austin, a journalism professor, really talks about this, um, in his book The Heart of Whiteness. We need to promote moral outrage. White folks should be feeling as outraged as people of color about the existence of white supremacy and white racism. And I will leave it here. Thank you so much for your attention. And maybe we'll have some time for some questions. The way I do it, cuz I'm teaching multicultural counseling, and I'm teaching it now in the Canadian context where it's just blowing white folks out of the water. Um. I think my students can attest to, they're in my class right now, sorry. Um. But one of the things I have to do it, I make some comments in the class to just kind of remind folks about, um, you may be feeling a lot of guilt right now. Or I have them write weekly journals and I may kind of summarize, well I read the 17 journals this week and I noticed some emotional responses coming up. I noticed that some of the white folks are feeling guilty, and that's a very natural, normal response. You should be feeling some of that. If it's getting to a point where it's so overwhelming that you wanna hide under the desk or not come to class, let's have a conversation. And when I star tot sense of the things in the journals, I try to have a private conversation with the students. It's a lot of extra work, but it really helps them to unpack some of their emotional responses. Some of them are angry. Some of them are like, why do I have to learn about this BS and I have to kinda say, I know some of you are gonna feel angry. Some of you are sitting here like this, and then the ones who are are like that. And, you know, just like what my partner Tony does in class. Some of you are wearing the Chief Illiniwek shirt. But to try to have some empathy. It's very, very difficult. And to help them, I think kind of what, um, Dr. Vasques was saying before, this morning, before you draw a line through their name, maybe draw the line in pencil and know that you might erase that line as they learn more and more. And I've seen some really incredible transformation in just one session. Sometimes I encourage students to talk to other white students who've gone through course the year before and just kind of process their feelings over a cup of tea or a glass of wine. You know, whatever suits them to try to work through that. Ands that reminds me, like, I was showing a film this week, and I brought tissues. And I made a joke about it but I said, it's, it's okay to cry in here. This, some of the things we're gonna be experiencing and learning about are very, very difficult to ingest. And I cry in the class and I know, um, I hope Toponterado's(ph) at this conferrence this time, but he's always talked to me and his partner Ingrid Greeger(ph) about the importance of modeling for the students and being able to show them that I fumble and I make mistakes and I have strong emotional responses. And what's important is how I recover, and how I work with some of those things. The first thing I wanna say is, you, you may not be aware of what a positive and profound impact that you have. I think, had somebody asked Robert Carter if I would bet talking about him 17 years later at a talk at the Roundtable, he would say no way. I was saying really dumb things in his class. Like, what about Oprah. Like I was saying things like that. Like I was like, come on. Like, what do you mean institutional racism and he was like banging his head against the wall with me. And I've, I've come a long way. So you may not be aware of that. The other point that you bring up, which I think is really critical, is we're in these white suprematist systems. I don't, I don't think these are ill-intentioned white folks. I really do think, as Barbara Trepagnier says, they're well meaning white folks. But the hegemonic(ph) nature of white supremacy, it's so embedded in the systems that it makes it so difficult to do the work. So one of the things I like so much and make time to come to these kinds of conferences, or I just went to the National Multicultural Conference Summit, and it's an expense and it;s time, but to connect with like-minded folks and get that kind of support for myself. Cuz I do think, um, what Dr. Vasques was talking about this morning, self care is such a crucial, crucial way to kind of deal with it on our own level. And all we can do is encourage the interns and the students. I, we can try to find other folks on the campus or int he institution or maybe in the community. We might point them toward, um, Mirrors of Privilege to see white folks who've kind of come through to the other side, who could talk about it. Um. Or maybe make connections with people at neighboring institutions who could come in and do a talk. Often times I would go into classrooms to do the white privilege lecture because my colleagues of color were the one always teaching the diversity classes. And I would go in to do it because it's a service that I hope I'm, I'm thankful that I can provide that. Because it doesn't seem like I have a hidden agenda about talking about white privilege. They're wondering what it is. They're trying to get the angle.
