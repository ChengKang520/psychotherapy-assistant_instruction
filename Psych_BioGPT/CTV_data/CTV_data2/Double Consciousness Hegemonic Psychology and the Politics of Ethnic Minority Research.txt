GEORGE GUSHEW Hi everybody, and thank you for coming. Uh, I'm George Gushew and I'm a member of the faculty here in the program of Counseling Psychology, and I'd like to welcome you to this presentation. Our speaker, is Kevin O. Cokley an Associate Professor of Counseling Psychology and African and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Texas, in Austin. Wait a second, this just in, as of September a full professor of Counseling Psychology and African and African Diaspora Studies. Yes. Um, he's also Editor in Chief of the Journal of Black Psychology. Dr. Cokley's research and teaching can be broadly categorized in the area of African-American Psychology. He has recently been elected to Fellow Status in the American Psychological Association for his contributions to Ethnic Minority Psychology and to Counseling Psychology. He was identified among the top 20 contributors to the Journal of Counseling Psychology between the years of 1999 and 2009. And among the top ten contributors to Multicultural Psychology Journals between 1994 and 2007. He's the recipient of the 1999 Charles and Shirley Thomas Award for mentoring ethnic minority students by the Society of Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority News, also known as Division 45. The recipient of the 2008 Top Ten Rising Stars of the Academy Award by Diverse Issues and Higher Education. And the 2007 Association of Black Psychologists Scharlarship Award. It is really our honor to have Professor Cokley with us this afternoon. And his address today is entitled "Double Consciousness: Hegemonic Psychology and the Politics of Ethnic Minority Research". Thank you so much for being here.

Overview of Today's Talk 

00:02:50
Content - W.E.B. Dubois - "Double Consciousness" - Hegemony in Psychology - Continued Marginalizatino of Ethnic Minority Research - Melville Herskovits - "Politics of Knowledge" = White Researchers and Multicultural Research - Definitional Disagreements 

00:02:50
Reflections on the "Journal of Black Psychology" and the field of Black Psychology 

00:02:55
KEVIN O. COKLEY Thank you, George, can you, can you hear me? Okay, um, it is indeed my, my pleasure to, um, be speaking today as we commemmorate, um, 30 years of this wonderful conference. Um, I remember, um, it's been a few years since I last spoke here and so I was really, um, humbled and honored to be asked to, to speak again. If you know anything about me, you know that I am one who does not stray from controversy. And so this talk will be chalked full of provocative assertions of my part. I welcome and invite the dialogue if we have time afterwards. I'm going to start off with, um, W.E.B. Dubois' notion of double consciousness. Um, I'm gonna spend a little bit of time talking about Hegemony in Psychology, then I'm going to transition to the continued marginalization of Ethnic Minority Research, um, we're gonna go to, um, the discipline anthropology and we're gonna talk a little bit about Melville, Melville Herskovits', um, and his idea of the "Politics of Knowledge". And then we're going to transition to an, to an old conversation that we've had years ago, around white researchers and should they conduct multicultural research? Um, and then we're going to transition to some discussion about what is Ethnic Minority Psychology? Um, because I would, um, contend that there is not a consensus on what even constitutes Ethnic Minority Psychology. And then, I will end by, um, reflecting on my time as Editor in Chief of the Journal of Black Psychology, and the field of black psychology specifically and the discipline of what I like to say Ethnic Minority Psychology generally. Okay? You with me? 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:04:45
Doubls Consciousness "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of the world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness, - an American, a Negro; two black souls, two thoughts...two unreconciled strivings; two warning ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." 

00:04:45
KEVIN O. COKLEY Excellent, excellent! Alright. So, this quote I'm sure if familiar to many of you. W.E.B. Dubois in 1903 in his book "Souls of the Black" quote. He says, I, and I quote, "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of the world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness, - an American, a Negro; two black souls, two thoughts... two unreconciled strivings; two warning ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." And I wanted to use Dubois' comments to provide a context for this talk. And, and, and the struggles that I see with ethnic minority, um, researchers. Um, on the one hand, we are charged with doing research that is acceptable to the so-called main-stream dominant, um, ethos within our discipline of psychology, and on the other hand, we want to do research that reflects the values of our communities. And when we focus our efforts on our communities, we sometimes have to struggle to try to justify our work to the main stream. And we continue to struggle with this idea of, you know, cannot be a researcher that's authentic to my community, but that still does work that is deemed acceptible by the main stream. And I thought Dubois' quote captures this double consciousness that we, um, find ourselves experiencing. 

00:06:35
Hegemony in Psychology 

00:06:35
Psychology is perceived as a "soft" science - Recent 2011 Monitor article about promising psychology as a STEM discipline. 

00:06:35
Only 30% of people believe psychology uses scientific method 

00:06:35
Most people think that psychology mostly consists of counseling and clinical work 

00:06:35
Perception that counseling psychology is among the "softest" specialties and least scientific psychology (see Best et al., 2001) 

00:06:35
Multiculturalism is a core value of counseling psychology (Toporek et al, 2005) 

00:06:35
Approximately 70% of counseling psychology programs have faculty who indicate multicultural research interests compared to only 32% of clinical psychology programs(Norcross et al, 1998) 

00:06:35
Unfortunately, the multicultural emphasis might contribute to, or perpetuate, the perceptino that counseling psychology is "soft" and not scientifically rigorous 

00:06:35
KEVIN O. COKLEY But, let's talk about psychology, shall we? Um, this little thing called Hegemony in Psychology, I'm sure you're familiar with it. Um, psychology has always had this, um, inferiority complex, right? You know, in comparison to, you know chemistry, biology, physics, you know, something natural sciences, um, because it's perceived as a soft science. Um, in a recent 2011 Monitor article, uh, it talks about promoting psychology as a STEM discipline. So, APA, over the past few years has worked very hard to get psychology to be seen and viewed as a legitimate science in and of itself. But only 30% of people believe that psychology even uses the scientific method. And most people think that psychology mostly consists of counseling and clinical work. And within this broad discipline of psychology, there is a perception that counseling psychology, the discipline that I represent, is among the "softest" specialties and the least scientific within psychology. Um, there was a recent article in American Psychologist, um, that examines, um, the skepticism of the public towards psychology in general. And, one of the things that the author, Lillian Field(ph), does is, he references counseling psychology a couple of different times. So, by this time, I'm feeling kind of bad, like, what's up, leave my discipline alone. Um, but, you know, we're getting picked on. One of the things that we know to be true about counseling psychology is that multiculturalism is a core value, for which I don't think we need to apologize. Um, approximately 70% of counseling psychology programs found that they indicate multicultural research interest compared to only 32% of clinical psychology programs. So, if you've done any sort of surveying, if you've had any sort of experience with these training programs, you'll see, um, hopefully you'll see there's a lot of truth to this. Unfortunately I believe the, the multicultural emphasis that we value in our discipline might contribute to, or perpetuate, the perception that counseling psychology is "soft" and not scientifically rigorous. So what to do? Do we abandon our values so that we can be seen as a more legitimate science? I think not. 

00:09:00
Promotion to Full Professor 

00:09:00
Comments by Dean 

00:09:00
"Methodological bias" 

00:09:00
Journal bias - too many articles in so-called "low impact" journals that focus on ethnic minorities (e.g. Journal of Black Psychology, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development) 

00:09:05
KEVIN O. COKLEY So, now let me just, let me back up for a moment. Um, George mentioned that I was recently promoted to full professor, and I am very, very glad that process is behind me, but I want to tell you a little bit about that process because it really fits into the narrative of this talk that I'm giving. So I have a joint appointment, um, in the department of educational psychology, you know, specifically to counseling psychology programs, 50%. And I have another 50% appointment in the newly created, um, Department of African and African Diaspora Studies. And so, for my promotion process for a professor, I have to go through two different processes. Um, that's double the work, double the number of electoral viewers, double everything. Um, and in fact, when I was asked to, to be a 50% member of the African and African Diasporas Studies department, I, I had some concern. Not because I was not committed to the discipline of sort of studying African Diaspora, but rather because of the politics of trying to negotiate a promotion that would involve two different academic units. Nor knowing that they are very different ways of understanding a person's record. Um, but, nevertheless, I, I chose to, um, to have this affiliation. In my Department of Educational Psychology, in the College of Education, my, rather smoothly. Um, consensus at the department level, consensus at the college level, um, all the way up. Um, and I felt very good about that. Um, the process in the African and African Diaspora Studies, um, department, was a little bit different. And not because of the department itself. I actually received consensus at the depar-, department level. But once it went to the, um, the college, the College of Liberal Arts, um, I had some trouble. And I was given some bad news from the chair of the Deparment of African and African Diaspora Studies, where he told me, that out of a 20 person committee, um, there were eight people who supported me and 12 who did not support me. Um, and struck. I was, I was, I was flabbergasted, um, and it was, and I can honestly say that was the first time in my academic career where I actually had such a naked assault, and challenge of my self efficacy(ph) as a researcher. And I had to sort of, you know, step back and make sense of what that could mean, you know, and, and if you've ever been in a situation where someone's basically told you you're not good enough, you start to question yourself, right? You began to look at, well maybe, you know, I should have published different types of articles, or in different types of journals, or maybe I should have done this, maybe I should have used more advanced statistical analasys, you go through all this, sort of, this self doubt. Um, within a span of 24 hours, um, I received another, um, e-mail from, or actually a phone call from the chair who said that he had been in contact with the dean and the dean disagreed with the decision, he felt that it was unfair and over-ruled them. And was giving me his support. Um, that means something. Um, but in my communication with them, he'd shared with me what the concerns were, and I want to share that with you. Um, the first concern that the dean noted, was what he called "methodological bias". And, alright, he didn't even mention me specifically, he actually was speaking to the Department of African and African Diaspora Studies about the tenure and promotion process. And he was giving examples of some of the difficulties, or some of the challenges that, that people who had just gone through the process were experiencing. I knew he was talking about me. I, you know, and he, and he, later, admitted as much. And as soon as he said methodological bias, I said, you know what? I bet you that on that committee there were psychologists, not psychologists from Department of Educational Psychology, but psychologists from the depart-, Department of Psychological Science. And I know that, if you know anything about people who are a part of that world, it's a very different world, uh, from the world that I inhabit. And, in fact, I was right. And it was the psychologists on that committee who were the most critical of my work. And, part of it was because I am not an experimentalist. I wasn't trained that way, that's not the way that I sort of view the world, and you know you can't be in an, that sort of department in the Department of Psychological Science, and not be, or it's very difficult to say, to be in that department and not be an experimentalist. So I knew that, that was the methodological bias that he was referring to. The second comment was, um, a comment about the journals that I was publishing in. Um, he said that there was concern that I was publishing too many articles in what's called, so-called "low impacted" journals that focus on ethnic minorities. And the specific example that he gave was, well the committee was concerned that you were publishing too many articles in the Journal of Black Psychology. And, now this was, this was before I was Editor in Chief, that was a very peculiar claim, given that in my time, post, uh, tenure and promotion, I was tenured and promoted in 2004, so given the span between 2004 and 2013, in my 20 plust articles I have published, I published exactly one article in the Journal of Black Psychology. I went back and looked at my record, cause I was like really, was I publishing that much in the Journal? One article I published in the Journal of Black Psychology. But apparently, that one article was too many. Uh, and was a concern. And then finally I said, well, let me go back and look at my record because maybe I'm missing something. So in my count on my record, I counted six articles that I had published in journals that would be, that would, that was focusing on ethnic minorities, um, six in comparisson to 14 or 15 that did not have that focus. So the claim was was peculiar to me and suggested to me that something else is going on other than, you know, sort of, you know, me publishing in so-called low impact journals. 

00:14:50
Publishing ethnic minority research in "high impact" journals is not simply about publishing the highest quality, most rigorous research - reflects Editors, Associate Editors, and Reviewers expertise as well as values and biases about what is important - This is often reflected in the racial ethnic composition of Editorial Board 

00:14:50
Nor does it always reflect the most impactful ethnic minority research 

00:14:50
What determines impact? Impact factor 

00:14:50
Impact factor - measure of the frequency in which the average article has been cited in a particular year or period. 

00:14:50
Baker and Wichers (2011) suggest that a high impact psychology journal is >4 and a low impact journal is < 1.5 

00:14:50
Noen of the top 50 high impact psychology journals focus on race, ethnicity or culture (Journal Citation Reports) 

00:14:50
Examples of "Low Impact, Specialty Journals" Journal of Black Psychology Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences Asian American Journal of Black Psychology Journal of Latina/o Psychology Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology* 

00:14:50
KEVIN O. COKLEY And, while we're on that topic, um, we should be really, really careful about the language that we use. Um, you know, I, I was at a conference recently and, um, some presenters, um, used the language of low impact specialty journals and they did not mean any disrespect, um, in saying it, they were just sort of presenting data on journals that, that focus on ethnical minority issues. Um, but, I, I found myself having a really strong reaction. Um, because the Journal of Black Psychology kept being used as one of the examples, and I found myself, you know, sort of, having a very strong reaction and, and I commented that, you know, we need to be very careful about the language that we use. And we need to des-, deconstruct this idea of low impact, and what does that mean and how do we sort of, who determines, who gets to determine what's an impactful journal and what's not an impactful journal? So we know that publishing ethnical minority research in, um, so-called, "high impact" journals is not simply about publishing the highest quality, most rigorous research. It reflects editors, associate editors, and reviewers expertise as well as the values and biases of what they view as important. And this is often times reflected in the racial ethnic composition of the editorial board. So, I don't know about you, but when I'm looking at journals, one of the first things that I do, I look at the composition of the editorial board. And if I don't see folks of color or at least white allies who've, who respect this sort of work, I, I, I have concerns, because I'm not convinced that my work will be given a fair and judicious evaluation. And so we know that that's part of the reality of many psychology journals. And publishing in these so-called high impact journals, does not always reflect the most impactful ethnical minority research. If you were to look at some of the articles that are the most cited in the ethnical minority literature, often times, these articles weren't published in these so-called high impact journals. So what's more important? Getting your work published in a journal that's recognized as high impact and it gets, doesn't get cited as much as another article that published in a so-called low impact specialty journal, that gets cited numerous times? Who gets to determine what constitutes impact? So, I'm glad that I asked the question. What determines impact? Those of you who are in the academy or perhaps you know, are familiar of journals, there's this little thing called the impact factor. Um, this impact factor has grown increasingly more important in the lives of many academics. Um, some of us would say it is the bain of our existence. Um, but what is this thing called the impact factor? The impact factor is the measure of the frequency in which the average article has been cited in a particular year or period. Um, impact factor, uh, metrics usually based on either one year or five year, um, sort of, um, intervals. And so the idea is that when you publish an article, you want the article to, to be cited, you know, frequently, and the more that journals have articles that have been cited the more, the higher the impact, and the more prestige, supposedly, that these journals will have. Um, in a recent article, uh, Baker and Wicherts suggest that a high impact psychology journal is greater than 4, and a low impact journal is less than 1.5. Alright? Now these numbers, you know, for, for some of you may not mean anything, but I'm gonna give you a little bit of context in terms of what that actually means. None of the top 50 high impact psychology journals, that is, journals with impact factors greater than 4, are journals that focus on race, ethnicity or culture. None of them. And, the journal, you know, that I'm most affiliated with in terms of my professional identity, the Journal of Counseling Psychology, isn't even in this top 50 high impact journals. So, not only do we have biases against, you know, potential biases against ethnic minority research, we have within psychology, disciplinary biases. Right? You feeling me? Okay. So, what are some examples of these so-called low impact specialty journals? Well, these are the journals, um, that based on their criteria do not meet the threshold. Now, of course, you know, with some of the journals are, Asian American Journal of Black...Asian American Journal...oh my goodness, Asian American Journal That's a typo, I don't know how I missed that. It just, it just caught me, I was doing some cutting and editing at the last minute, so...That would be an interesting journal, right? Asian American Journal of Black Psychology. Don't know how I missed that, my bad. Um, but some of the, some of the journals are newer journals and so they're not gonna have impact, um, factors. I put an asterisk by the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology because it wavers between being a high impact journal, based on their criteria or not. In 2010, it had an impact factor of over 1.8, so, in 2010 they were a high impact journal. Now, unfortunately it went below 1.8 so they are no longer a high impact. And that's relegated to the low impact specialty journals, um, category. Um, but again, let's think about this terminology. Let's look at these journals, these outlets that have been so important for so many of us for so many years. And, for those of you who want to publish, if I say to you, "Hey, how would you like to publish in a low impact specialty journal?" How many of you are gonna be running to get your pieces published in these journals? That's what I thought. Um, probably not too many of you. So, I, I, I would caution us about how we talk about the journals that represent and reflect the values of our communities. 

00:21:00
Continued Marginalization 

00:21:00
Following Graham's (1992) study, Imada and Schiavo (2005) found that between 1990 and 1999, only 4.7% of 6 APA journals studied ethnic minority populations where ethnic minorities were the focus of the study, or analyses were conducted by race in multiethnic samples. 

00:21:00
Non-APA journals published a higher % of studies (8.7%) during the same period. 

00:21:00
Developmental Psychology Journal of Educational Psychology Journal of Clinical and Consulting Psychology (6.8%) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (2.5%) Journal of Counseling Psychology (12.9%) Journal of Applied Psychology 

00:21:00
KEVIN O. COKLEY So, how else, is this work that we do marginalized? Um, following Sandra Graham's study, um, 1992, where she looked at, um, select APA journals to see how many of them actually included African-American participants, Imado and Schiavo found that between 1990 and 1999, only 4.7% of 6 APA journals studied ethnic minority populations where ethnic minorities were the focus of the study, or analyses were conducted by race in a multi-ethnic sample. Um, the found that non-APA journals published a higher percentage os studies, 8.7%, during the same period. And the journals that they included, you know, are on the right and the Journal of Counseling Psychology of those journals, was the journal that published the most, um, studies that focused on ethnic minority populations at 12.9%. And it only goes down from that point on. And, I, you know, on one hand I'm proud that the Journal of Counseling Psychology was the highest, but 12.9% is kind of low. Now granted, this was between 1990 and 1999. So perhaps a more recent analyses might reflect some, hopefully some different trends. 

00:22:15
Melville Herskovits 

00:22:15
Jewish American Anthropologist; Ph.D. from Columbia University 

00:22:15
Founded and was first president of the African Studies Center in U.S. 

00:22:15
Wrote the seminal book "The Myth of the Negro Past" - Traced the cultural retentions between Africa and the Diaspora 

00:22:15
http://www.pbsorg/independentlens/herskovits 

00:22:15
KEVIN O. COKLEY So, I want to transition you know, because I when we talk about ordinary research, um, you cannot avoid the discussion of the politics as research. Um, how many of you are familiar with Melville Herskovitz? Okay, one, two folks. Well, Melville Herskovits was a Jewish-American anthropologist who received his Ph.D. here, uh, Columbia University. And he founded and was the first president of the African Studies Center in the United States. He wrote the seminal book "The Myth of the Negro Past". Which traced the cultural retentions between Africa and the Diaspora. I was exposed to this book as a graduate student at Georgia State University, um, my, um, my academic and spiritual and intellectual mentor, Boba Asa Hiliard(ph), um, told me about this book and I was excited to find a book where scholars actually tried to consciously link, um, the contemporary African-American circumstance with African cultural, you know, sort of, um, history. And, I was, it was peculiar to me that it was a Jewish-American who, who actually did this, and if you, if you know this history, you know that Melville, um, Herskovits, was also in a, um, considered a very sort of provocative and controversial scholar. And in fact, he debated, um, you know, you know, several scholars, or was in disagreement with several scholars, um, one of them being E. Franklin Frasier(ph), uh, an African-American psociologist who did not agree with his idea that there were cultural retentions or, you know, cultural retentions, African cultural retentions of note, in contemporary African-Americans. So, think about this dynamic. You have a Jewish-American scholar who is saying, no African-Americans have African cultural retentions and dedicates a significant portion of this career to demonstrating this, And you have an African-American scholar, of who's prominent saying, no, that's not the case. Um, it really causes, at least it caused me to, to have some very confused and conflicted feelings about that dynamic. I want to, I have a clip here... 

00:24:35
MELVILLE HERSKOVITS What is a Negro in the sense that the term is used in the United States? Obviously one only has to look at the great degree of crossing tremendous variation in color that marks American Negros. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN I hear the voice of Melville J. Herskovits and what I wonder is, how did a white man come to know so much about black people? Probably more than any other American, Melville Herskovits is the person who demonstrate that African Americans are connected to African Americans. He was a leading anthropologist in the 20th Century and he was also a kind of social paradox. When you look at Herskovits, through one angle, he sets the terms for our understanding of the relationship between Africa and black people in the Americas. From another angle, you might see him as someone who appropriates a certain kind of knowledge. From another angle, he's the son of Jewish immigrants and he's trying to sort out his own position in America. I always like to think of him as kind of the Elvis of African-Ameican studies, on the one hand, you might think of someone like Elvis as someone who takes things that blacks have already been doing and he gets the credit for them. On the other hand you can say, well, here's a guy who actually mainstreams rock and roll. Herskovits mainstreams some of these ideas about the African and African-American culture. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Early antrhopologists were committed to demonstrating that black people were inferior. Many people believed black culture was a bad copy of white culture. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN Look, I, you know, if black people have been ignored and not listened to their part of the story as not being told, for centuries, it's understandable that black scholars aren't waiting in line behind some white guy to tell the story that they want to tell. 

00:26:30
MELVILLE HERSKOVITS What is a Negro, in the sense that the term is used in the United States? 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN What does it mean to ask what is a Negro? What is a Negro as a physical type? What is a Negro as an existential condition? What does the Negro want? How do we understand African-American belonging over time? Does the right to define, and describe and observe a people give you power over those people? Does the right to really characterize a people determine their fate?

Does the right to define, describe and observe a people give you the power over those people? 

00:27:10
DOES THE RIGHT TO CHARACTERIZE A PEOPLE DETERMINE THEIR FATE? 

00:27:10
What role should White majority scholars play in ethnic minority research? 

00:27:10
KEVIN O. COKLEY I love that question. "How did a white man come to know so much about black people?" And he talks about Herskovits being viewed from different angles. He sets the terms for understanding relationships between Africa and black people in Americas. He appropriates a certain kind of knowledge, uh, which advanced his career. Um, and he could also be viewed as the son of Jewish immigrants trying to understand his own identity. He was considered, or might be considered the "Elvis" of African-American studies. He mainstreamed the idea of the connection between African and African American culture. This question is a very powerful question. Does the right to define, describe and observe a people somehow give you the power over those people? Alright? That's a very profound question. Does the right to characterize a people determine, in some way, their fate? 

00:28:20
White Researchers and Multicultural Research 

00:28:20
In 1990, APA Convention a symposium chaired by Joseph Ponterotto examined the history of White researchers in cross-cultural research 

00:28:20
Many multicultural icons spoke (e.g., Pedersen, Casas, Helms, Sute) and the most provacative comments arguably came from Thomas Parham. 

00:28:20
Points included - Feelings of resentment (different levels of resistance) - Necessity to give something back to the community - Asking who speaks for multicultural counseling? - Wondering if majority and minority cultures can work together 

00:28:20
Mio and Iwamasa (1993) characterized the reaction as "a palpable tension in the air, with people of all colors feeling unsettled" 

00:28:20
"During the Q & A various audience members' voices were shaking" 

00:28:20
In 1993 The Counseling Psychologist published a Major Contribution "White American Researchers and Multicultural Counseling" (Mio & Iwamasa, 1993) - Characterized Parham as criticizing White researchers studying minority issues 

00:28:20
Many of the original multicultural scholars responded; Parham stated that they did not accurately characterize his message 

00:28:20
"My commentary was...intended to illustrate how many ethnic researchers feel when their efforts study culturally specific issues are met with a different level of resistance than their White counterparts receive...Culturally different researchers (CDR) watch their manuscripts being rejected by journal after journal, whereas White researchers are published with less difficulty. CDR watch White researchers make tenure using ethnic research as a vehicle, whereas ethnic researchers are denied tenure, ironically, because their research is said to be too narrowly focused on this or that cultural group, or published in an ethnic-specific journal to which White researchers give no credibility". 

00:28:25
KEVIN O. COKLEY And then I transition to what role should White majority scholars play in ethnic minority research? Now this is an old discussion. And so, in 1990, some of you, um, will remember this, because you were there and participated in it, in 1990, the APA convention had a symposium that was chaired by Joseph Ponterotto examined the history of white researchers in cross-cultural research. Many of the multicultural icons, that we know, spoke. And arguably, the most provocative comments made, came from our own dear Dr. Thomas Parham. Some of the points that Dr. Parham made, included, ethinical minority researchers feeling resentment. Uh, feeling resentment about their own research efforts being disrespected and marginalized and feeling resentment that their white colleagues doing research in the same area receiving much ore praise and accolades. Um, he talked about the necessities to give something back to the communities that you are studying, studying. He asked the question, "who speaks for multicultural counseling? Who speaks for multicultural research?" And wondered if majority and minority cultures can work together. Mio and Iwamasa in 1993, in the Counsel of Psychologists wrote a major contribution and to characterize the reaction as quote, "a palpable tension in the air, with people of all colors feeling unsettled". Know, if you know anything about Dr. Parham, he has a tendancy to make people feel unsettled. Um, as a brilliant you know, sort of, attribute on his part because he speaks truth to power. And in this instance, he spoke a truth that made people very uncomfortable. During the Q and A, various audience members' voices were shaking because they were so emotional about the comments made. And, you know, and I'm glad that Dr. Parham is here, because I wanted to really give honor to his contribution here, and instead of paraphrasing his words, I decided I would actually use them verbatim. Alright? But in 1993 the Counsel of Psychologists published a Major Contribution "White American Researchers and Multicultural Counseling. Um, in the Major Contribution lead article, um, Parham was criticized, oh, I'm sorry, Parham was characterized as criticizing White researchers studying minority issues. That was one particular characterization. Many of the original multicultural scholars responded, um, Dr. Parham stated that they did not quite accurately characterize his message. And he said, and I quote, this is a lot of words, but I didn't want to miss the substance of his thinking. He said "My commentary was...intended to illustrate how many ethnic researchers feel when their efforts study culturally specific issues are met with a different level of resistance than their White counterparts receive...Culturally different researchers (CDR) watch their manuscripts being rejected by journal after journal, whereas White researchers are published with less difficulty. CDR watch White researchers make tenure using ethnic research as a vehicle, whereas ethnic researchers are denied tenure, ironically, because their research is said to be too narrowly focused on this or that cultural group, or published in an ethnic-specific journal to which White researchers give no credibility". Um, you know, I guess we're fortunate because we don't have to deal with that now in 2013, right? Um, this was back in... 

00:32:00
Definitinoal Disagreements 

00:32:00
What constitutes ethnic minority research? 

00:32:00
This is an important question because it often reflects the beliefs and worldview of the researcher - Etic - behavior is culturally universal; often understood by ethnicity or race comparative studies; goal is a universally applicable psychological theory - Emic - behavior is culturally specific; understood in local cultural terms; goal is culturally relative psychological thory 

00:32:00
I believe the ethnic minority research has to be emic in nature. 

00:32:00
What constitutes ethnic minority research? 

00:32:00
Research where ethnic minorities are the focus of the study? 

00:32:00
Does it include research where analyses are conducted by race or ethnicity in multiethnic samples? (i.e., race comparative) 

00:32:00
Does it include research that focuses on White attitudes (e.g., prejudice) toward ethnic minorities? 

00:32:00
Research that seeks to inform theory, research and practice related to ethnic minority psychology? 

00:32:05
KEVIN O. COKLEY So, this idea of ethnical minority research, um, we might assume that well all agree on what it is. Um, I would submit to you that we don't agree what it is. So what constitutes ethnic minority research? This is an important question because it often times reflects the beliefs and values and a world view of the researcher. And if you sort of go to, you know, cross cultural psychology or multicultural psychology 101, where you have differences in sort of world views. And Etic perspective would say that behavior is culturally universal. It is often understood through the use of ethnicity or race comparative studies. The goal is to have a universally applicable psychological theory. Where as an Emic perspective says behavior is culturally specific. It is understood in local terms and the goal is culturally relative psychological theory. Now I want to be clear in saying that I'm not trying to pit these two world views against each other. Each world view is important in its own right. Um, but I, I do take a strong stand in saying this, I believe that ethnic minority research has to be emic in nature. And not everyone agrees with me on this assertion, but let me tell you why I think this. So again, what constitutes ethnic minority research? Is it research where ethnic minorities are the focus of the studies? That's unnecessary, but I would contend in sufficient condition. Does it include research where analyses are conducted by race or ethnicity in multiethnic samples? So-called race comparative, um, paradigm. Does it include research that focuses on White attitudes toward ethnic minorities? Is that rightfully considered ethnic minority research? Or is it research that seeks to inform theory, research and practice related to ethnic minority psychology? I personally, happen to scribe to this last idea. Let, let me back up for one moment. This idea of research where ethnic minorities are the focus of the study, is an important one. Um, because one of the things that we see happening over and over again, is when individuals have, um, data sets that have, happen to have diverse samples. And they sort of pick and choose samples, you know, people of color, and with no forethought about culture, race, ethnicity, they simply want to do research because they are curious about what they might find with an ethnic minority sample. Um, I feel very strongly in saying that that does not constitute ethnic minority research, simply because you have an ethnic minority sample. 

00:34:55
Reflections on Black Psychology 

00:34:55
Content analysis of research published in the Journal of Black Psychology (2000-2011) 

00:34:55
Necessary to continue examination and articulation of a field that reflects varied interests, ideologies, and approaches among scholars and researchers - Sample of African descent - Race comparative research - Use of psychological constructs and measures normed on Black samples 

00:35:00
KEVIN O. COKLEY And so, I want to, um, end my talk, by sharing my reflections as Editor in Chief of the Journal of Black Psychology, because all of these issues, um, have faced me during my tenure. So I conducted a content analysis of research published in the "Journal of Black Psychology", between 2000, and 2011. Um, I did this because like all fields, it is necessary to continually examine and, um, the articulation of a field, um, especially a field such as Black psychology which reflects so many different varied interests, ideologies, and approaches among scholars and researchers. Because, part of what I was seeing was one people submitting papers to the journal because they had a sample of African descent. A black sample. And that appeared to be their only criteria. Um, I was seeing research where there was comparisons being done between, um, black samples, and in most cases, white samples. There's, and if you know anything about the history of race comparative research, there has been, it is contested terrain. And there have been many discussions about why that is inappropriate, and in fact, you, you probably have had, or maybe are familiar with experiences, where ethnic minority researchers who want to do research on their communities, are told, or asked the question, "where's your white control group?" Alright? Very, that question, I think, really sums up you know, some of the hegemony that we see in our discipline. Um, and I was seeing research that used psychological constructs and measures normed on Black samples. So I was seeing, and I've been seeing all types of manuscripts submitted to the journal which clearly suggest, or reflect, differences and perspectives of the authors. 

00:36:40
Why Conduct Content Analysis? 

00:36:40
Content analysis of the JBP is necessary - As official journal of the ABPsi, JBP should publish research which reflects the mission and purpose of ABPsi - Only journal dedicated soley o publishing psychological research from Black or Afrocentric perspectives 

00:36:45
KEVIN O. COKLEY Um, I believe that a content analysis is important because the Journal is official, an official journal of the Association of Black Psychologists, and as an official journal of the journal, um, Association of Black Psychologists, it should reflect the mission and purpose of the Association. Just as APA journals would not have missions that contradict APA, the Journal of Black Psychology should have a mission that reflects the value of its sponsoring, um, professional organization. And it is the only journal, to my knowledge, that is dedicated soley to publishing psychological research from a black or Afrocentric perspective. 

00:37:20
Results 

00:37:20
Apparent that various perspectives exist - Using racial comparative framework (with minimal or no reference to Black psychology literature) - Examining White prejudicial attitudes toward Blacks - Offering a technically and theoretically sophisticated paper (whose explicit lins to field of Black psychology were less apparent) 

00:37:20
Only common denominator for empirical studies was including a Black sample 

00:37:20
KEVINE O. COKLEY So my results, the results were pretty interesting, um, it, I, I confirmed that, in fact, there were many different perspectives, um, that were represented. Um, using a racial comparative framework, I saw a number of studies that did that, but when they did that, there was minimal or no reference to black psychology or to the black psychology literature so in other words, these are authors who would have a black sample, often times a comparative black sample, to a white sample, um, and yet, there's nothing in their literature review, no discussion to try to link the study itself to black psychology.Now, these studies were not published under my Editorship, so I'm not, that's not, that's just an observation. Um, there was studies examining white prejudicial attitudes toward blacks. Now, their work is very important. I think that it needs to be done, but I, but I asked a question, is that black psychology? Is it black psychology to understand white people's attitudes towards us? Um, I saw evidence of some papers that were technically and theoretically very sophisticated. But no explicit links to the field of black psychology, um, were apparent. The only common denominator for empirical studies published in the Journal of Black Psychology, was including a black sample. The only common denominator. 

00:38:45
Discussion 

00:38:45
It would seem to be in the best interest of the field if a higher standard were used 

00:38:45
Otherwise researchers with no grounding in Black psychology or experience with Black populations will believe themselves competent to conduct and publish research in the JBP simply because they have a Black sample 

00:38:45
Imagine trying to publish in the Journal of Family Psychology with little to no knowledge about family systems, or publishing in Neuropsychology having only a cursory understanding of the brain 

00:38:45
Guiding question for JBP (and really all ethnic minority research) should be "How does this study or scholarly contribution contribute to advancing theory, research, and practice of Black psychology/ethnic minority psychology? 

00:38:45
If Black psychology specifically, and ethnic minority psychology generally, is aviable field of research, and not simply the application of Eurocentric psychological theories to Blacks and other ethnic minorities, Black and ethnic minority research should offer culturally specific definitions, constructs, models, theories, measures, and conceptualizations of behavior and mental health rooted in the lives and experiences of Black people and all ethnic minorities. 

00:38:50
KEVIN O. COKLEY Now, it would seem to me that it would be in the best interest of the field not only of black psychology, but really of ethnic minority psychology, that we use a higher standard. We cannot relegate the work that we do to simply have an access to people of color. We have to be better than that. Otherwise, researchers with no grounding in Black psychology or experience with Black populations will believe themselves competent to conduct and publish research in the Journal of Black Psychology simply because they have a Black sample. Um, I, I find that extremely problematic, and yet, I, unfortunately, I continue to see evidence of this practice. Imagine trying to publish in the Journal of Family Psychology with little to no knowledge about family systems, or publishing in Neuropsychology having only a cursory understanding of the brain. You couldn't do it. We should not expect any less from our journals. So the guiding question that I have for the Journal of Black Psychology and I think that we should have for all ethnic minority research, should be, how does this study or scholarly contribution contribute to advancing theory, research, and practice of Black psychology/ethnic minority psychology? If we cannot answer that question, it is my opinion, that that research should not be published in the journals that, that focus on ethnic minority populations. And if black psychology specifically, and ethnic minority psychology generally, is truly a viable field of research, and not an appendage, or simply the application, of Eurocentric psychological theories to Blacks and other ethnic minorities, Black and ethnic minority research should offer culturally specific definitions, constructs, models, theories, measures, and conceptualizations of behavior and mental health that is rooted in the lives and experiences of Black people and all ethnic minorities. We cannot, as, um, some, um, well-known ethnic minority scholars have said in the past, said to been as darker skinned versions of white Eurocentric paradigms. That, in and of itself, is an offensive assertion. 

00:41:05
Conclusion 

00:41:05
Important for the editorial staff (gatekeepers of the ethnic minority research) to have a clear vision of the field. 

00:41:05
Questions involving - Sufficiency of having a sample of African descent - Conducting race comparative research - Importance of using Black/African-centered psychological theories, constructs and measures 

00:41:05
I believe these issues apply to all ethnic minority research 

00:41:05
Must be continually engaged and debated as the JBP and other so-called "low impact specialty journals" become increasingly popular outlets for researchers 

00:41:10
KEVIN O. COKLEY So, it is important for the editorial staffs of these, um, journals, who are the gate keepers of ethnic minority psychology, it is important that they have a clear vision of what this field that we call ethnic minority psychology, is. We need to continue to engage in answering questions of is it sufficient to have a sample of African descent, or is, ethnic minority sample. Is that all that it takes to do research that's labeled ethnic minority psychology? And is that all that it takes to get, you know, access into our journals? Um, is it impo-, is it, ethnic minority research that is simply involving comparisons with white samples. Now, I've gone on record as saying that I'm not categorically against all racial comparative research. Um, and in fact, you know, depending on how it's conceptualized, it can used to advance ethnic minority psychology. But in the instances and the examples that I have seen, that has not been the case. It's simply being, if you, if you look at the cross cultural psychology literature, it's doing comparisons for the sake of trying to come up with a universal psychological, applicable theory. It is not with the intent of advancement of ethnic minority psychology, and that's a difference. Um, and we need to continue to engage in questions about the use of culturally specific theories, constructs, and measures that reflect our communities. And I believe these issues apply, not only to black psychology, but really, to all ethnic minority research. So we must be continually engaged and we must debate as the "Journal of Black Psychology" and other so-called "low impact specialty journals" become increasingly popular outlets for researchers. And so I would, I would caution my brothers and sisters who are editors and on the editorial boards of other ethnic specific journals that you be very careful about the research that you allow into your journals. That you have a higher standard because we don't want people coming in and taking advantage of our communities and we don't want people coming in and, and publishing research when they are not, when they do not have and existential connection to the communities, and or they do not attempt to give back to those communities. And, and, and I want to be very, very careful, and again, this is an old discussion that, you know, many of you in the room have had and been engaged in for years. I am not saying that members, um, who are not part of these communities should not even be engaging in this research. That is not what I'm saying at all. But there is a certain respect that must take place. And you respect us, you respect our communities, you take the time to read our literature, you understand who we are to understand our values. And that it is disrespectful to think that you can simply collect data from some black and brown bodies, write about them, and then submit and publish them when you have not existential connection to those communities. No understanding, or no knowledge of those literatures. That is what I'm suggesting And we have, fortunately, we have people, we have White allies, who have done just that. Um, but unfortunately, we have so many more who have not and do not do that. And on that note, I thank you! 

00:44:40
KEVIN O. COKLEY That has been one of the primary criticisms of certainly, an, an, an African and African-centric approach. This idea that you are essentializing a very diverse continent and trying to, you know, scribe, essential characteristics to a very, a very diverse people. Um, you know, what I would suggest to you, is, I think that we can, well, I know that there have been scholars that I would have found myself in alliance with, Shakan Diaz(ph), for example, and others who would say that there is a cultural unity, even amongst a very diverse African descendent group of people. Um, and so when you read their scholarship and you see the work that they've done, it's hard to not come away with this idea and belief that despite the diversity amongst people of African descent, there are cultural threads that unite and bind us. Now, this is, this is not without contention, and there are people, like E. Franklin Frasier(ph) and more contemporary scholars, who have a, who have a problem with the Afro-centric project because of this idea that it is essentialist. And people just, you know, agree to disagree. Uh, I am of the school of thought that people of the descent have a cultural unity, that, even though our circumstances, you know, whether we're in the Caribbean or on the continent, or on Europe, or where ever we find ourselves in a diaspora, while there may be certain things that are clearly different, that there are, there's a underlying ethos that, that binds us. 

00:46:15
KEVIN O. COKLEY What I presented to you, in the, just empirically, that the journals that care the most about these issues aren't the "high impact" journals that are given, you know, sort of, afforded a certain, sort of, privilage in our discipline. And, you know, it's, it's, it's really sort of, a matter of, of, of challenging this idea that work can only be impactful in certain types of journals. Now, now my own personal approach, when I was, um, um, on tenure, was to try to publish broadly. You know, so I wanted to demonstrate that I could publish in so-called "high impact" journals, which I did, as well as, you know, journals at different, you know, perceptions of status. But, I, I am clear that if someone, you know, chooses to, um, publish their work in journals that are open to that work and have this good sound theoretical, methodological sort of work. Then, you should be able you should be able to make the case that this work is impactful. But, there's some, there's a political reality. And the political reality is that promotion and tenure committees look at, they're numbers driven. And they look at impact factor metrics. And if we were to take those metrics to heart, then those of us who are in counseling psychology who only publish in the Counseling Psychology's or the Journal of Counseling Psychology would be seen as publishing in "lower impact" journals. So it's all relative. 

00:47:45
KEVIN O. COKLEY And you know there are other metrics that are being used now. You might be familiar with the H-index, you know, which is a, which is a newer metric out there, where where the idea is that it is not simply, it is not only important in terms of how many articles you publish. Because what if you publish a hundred articles but no one is citing them? So the H-index is a metric that considers not only how much you publish, but how often you're, you know, you're really being cited. And so, if I'm someone who, um, let's say that I've published, um, 20 articles and none of those articles have ever been cited. So that's, that's one, what kind of impact have I had? If I've cited, if I've published 20 articles and those 20 articles have been cited you know, 20 or more times, then that's a different level impact. So you have two people who've both published 20 articles, but one has been cited a lot more than the other, and so there are more contentionalized ways of sort of understanding the impact of a scholars work. Now, that's irrelevant for younger scholars because it takes time to develop and H-index, but there are, I guess my point is, there are ways to talk about your work to provide a context so that people will understand it's merit, and it's important. 

00:49:00
KEVIN O. COKLEY I am a gatekeeper. I'm a gatekeeper, so when someone sends something to the "Journal of Black Psychology" I make the decision of whether it's even going to see the light of day in terms of review. Because I have my own idea about what's appropriate for the field. You know, and again, you know, people are free to disagree with me, but, while I'm editor, these are the decisions that I make. And every editor has that charge. 

00:49:20
KEVIN O. COKLEY Thank you all very much!
