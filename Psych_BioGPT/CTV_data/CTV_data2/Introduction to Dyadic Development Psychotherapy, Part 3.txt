Introduction to

Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: 

00:00:00
DVD III 

00:00:00
DANIEL HUGHES What we thought of this afternoon is, Art and I would do each show three segments of different therapy sessions of this model. And it's really, like, depends on what part of the elephant you see, and it depends on where you are on the elephant as to what the elephant, you think the elephant looks like. Well, DDP is sort of the same way because it is so individualized. It depends on the client, the therapist and the relationship. And it depends on where they are in the treatment. Each time, it is just unique. The principles are the same. The principles how do you connect to a kid who doesn't want to be connected. How do you help them to feel safe enough and then to discover relationships actually are healing, and helping, and… and fun. And, and you feel great with a good relationship with a parent. How do you help a kid figure that out? Well, it's so umm… individualized and it's just… it's just… anyway. So we thought if we chose six different tapes of… Art and I, so two therapists, six tapes. In years past, we've had six therapists up here showing six different tapes of six therapists. You just have a sense of it. Also, you probably… you've probably won't… Well, no… Yes, you will. Early stage… In this one, you're about to see. It's a 10-year-old girl with her guardian. Her guardian took care of her from about a year old, uh, when… It was outside the, the foster care system. A neighbor was not taking care of this kid and had the guardian take care of her a lot, and then just left and said, "You could have her." So the guardian kept her. But the, the parent came back and says, "I want her on weekends." And the guardian didn't think she had any rights. So she said, "Well, okay." Well, at five… This… the parent, the mother took her, like, one weekend a month until she was five, at which point, there was evidence of physical and sexual abuse during these weekends. So they stopped and the girl now didn't trust anybody and was very aggressive, very defiant. So she went into a residential program. It's a beautiful program. It's in North Carolina that that has an attachment model. So within about six months, this girl had figured out she needs a mother and her guardian was there. Her guardian, the husband, the two of them were very committed to this girl, you know, actively working with the program to have her come back home safely, a very aggressive kid. So how to get her home safely? She's really settling in and the… I came down to do some supervision and training, which I routinely do for this program. And she was… had made progress. Not so much, again, you like behavioral progress, but that's not the bottom line. The bottom line is the kid making sense of things and showing different attitudes, and different motivation, different desire. Well, the last visit, when the guardian came, she actually was sad when she was leaving, and asked for her and said when is she coming back, whereas in prior visits, it had always been, "What are you bringing me? I don't care if you go." You know, she actually was missing this guardian. She had figured out she needs this guardian. So beautiful progress in six months, which isn't bad for a kid, 10 years old, with, with her history, but very committed. So anyway, they asked when I was there doing a consultation, this was in the spring, they asked if I would be willing to see if I could facilitate her move toward the guardian, so that then the therapy, continuing therapy. So the therapist was in the room with me. And I'm taking the lead in this and seeing if we can help this kid to turn to the guardian for more comfort and support.

00:03:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Okay. What I'm going to show you… This is a teenager. She's sixteen, almost seventeen, with a single mom, therapeutic foster placement. Umm… she will be adopting the girl at the end of the summer. Umm… bit a little bit of history, removed from her birth family when she was maybe five, something like that. I forget exactly. Lots of abuse, lots of neglect, a variety of foster homes, some good, some not so good, was adopted at… I believe age 10. Umm… and then the adoption was disrupted at 13. And the kid had been again neglected and abused in this home, came to this home. So she's been in this home now about three years. Single parent as I mentioned, young parent. In this session… And, and this is sort of middle stage I would describe it as. I'm not gonna… I was gonna show you the first part and then the end of it, but I just don't think we have time if we're going to talk about it. But umm… she… lot of… What happened in the earlier part of the session, she was talking about. She didn't have her cell phone anymore. Her, her mom took it away because of something she did. And what it was that she did, mom had told me, but the girl didn't want to tell me. She had taken some naked pictures of herself and, in a conversation with a boyfriend, sent them to the boyfriend. And that, you know, resulted in her not being able to keep her cell phone. And there had been a whole set of issues before that about a cell phone. And she had one. And it was pretty monitored and then the mom let her have it unmonitored. This happened. Anyway… umm… so I want to know kind of what happened. She doesn't really want to tell me. Umm… and in fact, in the session before that, she… uh… Yeah, in the session before that, it had come up and didn't really want to tell me. But she… this… the dilemma for her, this is… Again, this is how you can tell it's the middle stage, in the past, in the previous session, she promised me she would tell me the next week. I said, "Well, okay, that's fine". She, you know, even pinky swore. So, you know, and so her dilemma was she really didn't want to tell me because she was embarrassed. But you pinky swore with me and so she felt she had to. And, you know, I kept, in the early part, saying, "You know, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to." And so it was her kind of internal conflict. So I'm going to show you it's toward, toward the middle of the session, a couple of things that come up. Umm… and then what goes on with her, her therapeutic foster mom. If there's time, I can show some of the earlier parts, but… You'll see this. So it's a teenager. Oh, the other thing I like about this clip, in particular, is umm… you'll see I'm trying to… I'm trying to figure out with her what her tears are about. And I really don't get it, umm… what her tears are about. And so you see as I kind of try to figure it out with her and I keep missing it. And she keeps telling me, that's wrong, you know, you're not right. I just kind of stay with it, and eventually I get it which is, you know, took… takes me about six minutes. You know, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But eventually I get it. Umm… and then from there it goes on to, uh, you see something with her mom. And then at that point, then she tells me what happened. And what I think you're see… what you're winding up seeing is that at that point she feels I really get her. I got her so now she can share this very embarrassing kind of thing. 

00:07:35
AUG 4 2009 

00:07:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN It's up to you. You're the… This whole list there, often you came up with. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN I think there's probably a way you can kind of say what happened without going into graphic specifics. Don't you think? 

00:07:40
KRIS (inaudible ). 

00:07:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN What are your tears about? 

00:07:55
KRIS Because it's really embarrassing that… I'm still really ashamed of it. 

00:08:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Do you think your mom, do you think your mom looks… maybe looks down on you because of that or… 

00:08:10
KRIS No, I did something I'm not proud of. Something I… I wish I didn't. 

00:08:10
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN So I kind of guessed that, you know, may be… I don't say it this way, but my guess is may be she doesn't want to talk about it because she is worried about what her mom thinks. And so I say, "Oh, may be you're worried about your mom will look down on you and…" No, that's, that's not it. I got, got that one wrong. But that's okay. But, but again notice, even though I get it wrong, that doesn't stop her because we have some relationship history. There's a sense there even though, you know, sometimes we do go back and forth and she finds me annoying and irritating a lot. She also knows it's in a good natured way and I really am trying to help her and her mom. Do you know how your mom feels about it? 

00:08:50
KRIS I don't know. 

00:08:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You don't know? 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Well, I think you do. We talked about it. Right? 

00:08:55
KRIS I don't know. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN You don't know? 

00:09:00
KRIS We've never talked about how you felt about it. 

00:09:05
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Do you want to know how she feels about it? 

00:09:10
KRIS Sure. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN In what respect? Like, what do you mean? 'Cause, I mean, we talked a lot about it. What don't you know? 

00:09:15
KRIS Well, how you feel about it? 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN How I feel about you because of it… 

00:09:15
KRIS No, how you feel about it in general. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Well, I think, you know, you got yourself in a position that was very uncomfortable. You basically didn't know how to, you know, stand up for yourself really, and made a mistake. But that's, you know, I mean, I don't think that that's a bad thing. It was just a learning experience. Right? 

00:09:35
KRIS Yes. 

00:09:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Well, you know how your mom feels about you after that? 

00:09:35
KRIS No. I already know. She doesn't look down at me. It is just one of those mistakes that people look, like, back and they're ashamed of it. And I don't wanna talk about it with anyone. 

00:09:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Hmm. You don't have to. 

00:09:50
KRIS But I made a promise. And I can't break a promise. 

00:09:55
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN It's only 'cause you're s ashamed about it. If your mom… 

00:10:00
KRIS Because it was seriously bad. 

00:10:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN What makes it… What made it… What makes it so bad? 

00:10:05
KRIS It's the worst thing I have ever done. And I still hate myself for it. 

00:10:10
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You hate yourself for it? 

00:10:10
KRIS Yes. 

00:10:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN That's pretty serious. How come you hate yourself? 'Cause your mom doesn't hate you for it. Am I right? 

00:10:20
KRIS It's not about my mom. 

00:10:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh, I know. 

00:10:20
KRIS It's about what I did. It's not to my mom. It's not towards my mom. 

00:10:25
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN No, I know that. 

00:10:30
KRIS It is about something I did that I hate myself for. 

00:10:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Right. 

00:10:30
KRIS Because it was the stupidest, most worst thing that I have ever done. 

00:10:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN But what I am asking… So again what you see, I don't… You know, again, I have sort of missed the point. But we have a relationship there, right? Because I missed the point and she's not saying, "Forget it." Right? She, she's trying to get me to get it, right? That speaks to a relationship. Now, you know, it said it'd be nice if you could just say that maybe… if she wasn't so upset and if you could be a little more on the mark. But that that happens in relationships. You don't understand things, you go back and forth. But she's clearly invested enough that she doesn't want me to get it. Right? And so you will see that. You'll see how that evolves. And again, middle phase, what she's talking about is the thing she did. She, she's moved away, a fair degree, from feeling she's a bad kid to she's a kid who did something bad. And for her, that's a big thing. You know, really… You could think of it, developmentally she's moved from feeling mostly shame to now feeling, What? Guilt. Right? Okay. And that… that's a big developmental step because when you feel guilt, right, what you want to talk about it, you want to fix it, you want to figure it out. She's not trying to hide, right? And in fact, she's not saying, "I'm never gonna talk about it." She's saying, "Oh, you know, I don't want to talk about it because I'm so embarrassed. You know, but I, but I made a promise, alright? Promise to you, so I have to tell you." So know she's got this dilemma. I am asking this, I understand you do, but your grandma doesn't, I wouldn't dare ask if she knows, but your mom doesn't. 

00:12:10
KRIS It's not about who I… It's about me. 

00:12:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:15
KRIS I don't care that they… It's not… I hate myself. I don't hate them. 

00:12:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN So what… So why do you feel so badly about… 

00:12:25
KRIS Because I made a stupid decision. 

00:12:25
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:12:25
KRIS I made… I didn't know what to do and… 

00:12:25
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:12:25
KRIS I hurt my, like… I'm so ashamed of it. 

00:12:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Tell me, tell me what makes it so awful for you? 

00:12:35
KRIS Because. 

00:12:40
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah? 

00:12:40
KRIS Peer pressure especially is hard to get out of. 

00:12:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Mm-hmm, that's, that's true. And so what makes this so hard and hurtful? 

00:12:45
KRIS Because if you knew what I did, then you would understand. But I don't want to tell you that. That's the thing. The only reason why Ms. Melisa knew is because she went and ran him out before even coming to me. 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN No, no. Do you want to know why I did that thing? 

00:13:05
KRIS I know why you did it. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Why? 

00:13:05
KRIS Because you didn't want to talk to me about it alone. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Well, Kris, I was afraid you might really lose it. And I thought it could be better for you. And help you keep yourself together little more if, you know… besides, I'm required to tell those things anyway. 

00:13:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I guess what… Ms. Melisa is her youth worker at the agency, that's the foster care agency. She kind of knows… 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN She, she knows that you already know about it, right? 

00:13:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Um… I don't know. I mean, I mean, I didn't… You know, I didn't say, like, "I don't know, please tell me." And… 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN But she thought that you (inaudible ). 

00:13:40
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh, yeah, yeah. She knows that and she… I mean, she knows her mom and I always talk about stuff. I mean, she is a smart girl and she is a smart kid, and she is certainly, at this point, has figured out how that works. So I would, I would figure… I would guess she does know, but maybe not. I mean, she may not have put all the pieces together. I'd like you to help me understand there… there are other things you've done and you've felt bad about… 

00:14:10
KRIS But this is the worst. 

00:14:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Right. And I want to understand what makes it the worst 'cause you… 

00:14:15
KRIS I… I don't know. I haven't thought it, okay? Just give me some time to think about it and put it. 

00:14:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Okay, forget about it. You know, I'm thinking, there have been times you… there have been times in the past, you've said things to your mommy, you actually hit your mom. Right? 

00:14:25
KRIS This is the most thing I've ever… I am the most ashamed of. 

00:14:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN So, so what makes this… 

00:14:30
KRIS Because it hurts my future. It hurts the way I look at myself. 

00:14:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN How does it hurt your future? 

00:14:40
KRIS Because… 

00:14:40
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:14:40
KRIS It just does. 

00:14:40
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN But I mean, how? 

00:14:45
KRIS You don't understand. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN I don't understand how it won't hurt your future either, sweetie. 

00:14:50
KRIS Because if I don't look at myself as someone who can get through things, then how am I gonna get through future things. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Well, because don't we learn by making mistakes? And growing and… 

00:15:00
KRIS I don't know, Mom. 

00:15:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN or you're kind of worried that you might… 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Might do it again? 

00:15:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Exactly. 

00:15:05
KRIS No, okay? I don't know. 

00:15:05
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You don't know? 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Well, okay. 

00:15:05
KRIS Just like I didn't know this was gonna happen, I didn't… I don't know. I didn't know I was gonna fall out of a tree today. Sometimes, you just don't know. 

00:15:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN That will be pretty upsetting, if you did something you feel ashamed of and you're not confident you wouldn't do it again. That would be really upsetting. So is that… is that part of it? You're just not convinced that if you were put in a similar situation, you might not do something equally as embarrassing? Is that what you mean? Okay. So it took actually, only five-and-a-half minutes. But right now… Again, you can, you can see in terms of the relationship, I finally get it. And she calms down because now her feelings aren't just stuck in herself, right? And that she's not alone with her feelings. Now somebody may understands and can share those with her. Now I get her. Now that I get her and she knows that I get her, now she calms down. Okay. Again see, it's a nice example of how powerful relationships are and how powerful this concordant inter-subjectivity is. Before this, there's discordant inter-subjectivity because I'm missing some things. Now all three elements are in, in synch, and it, it really is a quite powerful. It's okay. So you weren't there. Some… someone, another peer could put you in a position when you do something that later you really regret. You're not sure you'll be able to stop it or say no. Is that what you mean? Okay. 

00:16:50
KRIS No. 

00:16:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I'm just… 

00:16:50
KRIS If you had fallen out off a tree and hurt your wrist, you'd feel the same way. 

00:16:55
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I'm just saying, you know, I assumed it, right? But she's doing, so you want encourage her. 

00:17:00
KRIS I do, but… 

00:17:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You want to… You want to do things to encourage her that how… Oh, what I was talking about here is her mom has her arm around her and her mom isn't the most demonstrative person. And I was just kind of noticing had commented before. I think this is the one of the first times I've seen your mom do that. And, you know, they are saying, "Oh, no, we do this all the time at home." She had… When she was talking about falling out of a tree, that was not a metaphor, she actually had early at the day fallen out of a tree and sprained her wrist. But every time like her mom, like, would move, she'd go, "Ow! My arm, you know, it's broken. You're killing me." Umm… so I was asking her. And she said, "Oh, she really likes it." And I was just saying, "Gee, it's funny, you really like it and you keep giving her a hard time about it." So in effect what we've done, we… we've figured out what it was that made it so difficult for her to talk about it. Got to some, you know, a real connection there. In some ways this is the break, okay, 'cause you can't keep hammering away at stuff. This is a bit of a break, so to speak, and then we'll get back to that that issue. There's that ebb and flow in terms of emotional intensity. That's what you see here. You want to… 

00:18:15
KRIS I do. 

00:18:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You want to do things to encourage her to have her do more of that and not be as, not be as… 

00:18:20
KRIS I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just a bad day… 

00:18:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I didn't say be bad, I wasn't gonna say be difficult. I'm saying help your mom not be as, as umm… formal, is that the right word? Would that sound right? 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Formal? 

00:18:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I haven't seen you sitting net to each other. I don't… I think this is the first time I… May be also, but this is the first time I've seen your mom put her arm around you. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Hmm… 

00:18:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:18:45
KRIS She does it all the time. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Okay, I'm just saying this anyway. But, yeah, it just seems to me if you're really worried that if you were put in a similar situation, you'd do the same thing again and you'd feel awful about it. This is something serious that we ought to work on. So that, so that the next time we have a conversation, you can say, "What I did, I regret and I feel bad about. And, and I wish that I didn't do it. But, you know, I know I would just never do that again." You, you need to feel confident that you would never do that again. Would, would you like that? Yeah. So, so at some point, you'll get there. We're gonna have to talk about it. Whenever you're ready. So again, you know, I don't want to push her. I know this is difficult. I know we'll get to it at some point. And again, whether we do it today, next week or in two months, it doesn't really make a difference. You know, I really want her to feel I want to help her. I want to be there for their family and help them. But this is the, you know, leading not pushing. So I'm gonna keep encouraging her, leading her, but I'm not going to push her to do something she really doesn't want to do here. Especially for kids who have experienced their world as being one over which they have almost no control, people do things to them, creating experiences where they legitimately can have some authentic sense of control over what happens is, is important. It's therapeutic. And it's… You know, it's up to you at this point. 

00:20:25
KRIS I don't know. 

00:20:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah, you know. You did promise last time. 

00:20:35
KRIS And a boy over the phone with pictures and I hate myself for it. 

00:20:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Hmm… The pictures were of? 

00:20:45
KRIS Me. 

00:20:50
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Of you. Oh. And so, oh, you sent pictures over the phone? 

00:21:00
KRIS Yes, picture messages of me half-naked. 

00:21:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh. 

00:21:00
KRIS Now you see why I'm afraid to talk about it? 

00:21:05
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I can see why you are embarrassed. I not sure why you're afraid. 

00:21:10
KRIS Because it's not something I ever want to talk about. 

00:21:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN So who is the boy? 

00:21:15
KRIS An ex-boyfriend. My first boyfriend. 

00:21:20
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Somebody who looked like Carmen? 

00:21:20
KRIS She actually let me date him. And now I… 

00:21:25
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Carmen was the first parent who adopted her and then disrupted the adoption. 

00:21:30
KRIS And now I think to myself why wouldn't my mother let me date him. 

00:21:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You were 10 when you were with her. 

00:21:35
KRIS No, I was 13 when I started dating him. 

00:21:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Thirteen? Oh. 

00:21:40
KRIS I was dating him all the way up until a day before I left her house. 

00:21:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh, so you've stayed in touch with her? (inaudible ). 

00:21:46
KRIS Well, no, I got in touch with her through Myspace, and then we started to talk and I made a mistake. 

00:21:55
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Are you still on Myspace? 

00:22:00
KRIS I'm on Myspace, but I blocked him. So… And my Myspace profile is set private and I changed all my information on there. 

00:22:10
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Okay. Is that one way… Is it like Facebook, only friends can see it? Is that how… is that… only friends can see it? 

00:22:15
KRIS Yeah. 

00:22:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Not friends of friends. Oh, I see. Has your mom looked at your Facebook page, or… 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Sure did, recently. But I do, yeah. 

00:22:25
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN I really didn't change anything much. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, she had only used it like once. 

00:22:30
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh. Pardon me. Do you have a Facebook page? Is that how you see it or? 

00:22:35
KRIS Yeah. 

00:22:35
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh, okay. So you're friends of each other. I see, okay. 

00:22:35
KRIS Yeah. I really have to go out and get grandpa. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:22:40
KRIS Sorry. So her grandfather is on my… Facebook. 

00:22:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Oh, is he? Okay. It's cool. 

00:22:50
KRIS An 80-year-old man is on Facebook. It's funny. 

00:22:55
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN It is. It's a good way to stay in touch with people. So… so, so you sent him half-naked pictures of you. 

00:23:05
KRIS Yes. 

00:23:05
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN So how did… so how did that happen? I mean, it didn't start out like that, did it? 

00:23:10
KRIS We were talking, and he just randomly said that he liked me still and still wanted to be with me. And all this other stuff, and I was like, "Oh, okay, whatever." And then he sent me a message saying, "You know what, please send me some pictures of you." I started off by sending normal pictures, just thinking he wanted to see what I looked like now. And then he said, "No, you half naked or naked." And I was just like, "I can't do that. Sorry." And he was like, "If you don't face your fears now, how're you're gonna face them in life?" And that's when I kind of, well, didn't do it to the fullest. That's what he wanted. 

00:24:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. So what was it about what he said in the… that piece that he said in the moment that made sense to you? 

00:24:10
KRIS Because people do always say to face your fears. And I was like, he might be right. I don't know. 

00:24:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Umm… okay, we have got a couple minutes for questions or comments. Yeah? 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN She… (inaudible ). 

00:24:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Umm… I guess that didn't occur to me. What, what occurred to me umm… what my thinking was at the moment was, umm… "Boy, she's really upset. Umm… this is how she feels." Umm… and I guess I thought that that's probably was an accurate description of how she was feeling about herself. You know, it didn't seem like it was an exaggeration or she was using wrong words. And based on my experience with her, although she, she can be a bit dramatic, I just thought… And a lot of teenagers can be. I just thought that that's how she was feeling, and decided, at least in my mind what I was thinking to accept that and move with that as opposed to say, "Well that's a pretty strong word. Maybe I mean… maybe you mean really upset to just accept and go with that." Because I again, as you saw, it took me a while to really get what it was she was upset about. So until… For me, until I really know what it is that's driving the behavior, I, I don't want to do too much else except figure that out. So I don't want to go off on what seems to me is tangents if my focus is… I really want to know what it is that's so disturbing here. As I said, that was my thinking. Yes. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN You may later have gone into this, but since you know she had a history of… Is this the one that had a history of physical and sexual abuse? 

00:26:15
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Uh… Well, she was physically abused. And, yes, she was a molested by a grandfather, by a foster parent and a neighbor I believe. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN So her view is (inaudible ) In your mind, did you have maybe mentioned that this could be an insight into that part of her mind, the fact that she did something that was sexual, per se, and as such she… Or did you just inaudible ) You know what I'm saying? 

00:26:55
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah, I didn't see the… Once I figured… Once she helped me figure out with her what the issue was, which is that, "What this guy said made sense and I don't have any confidence in my ability to make good judgments." That just didn't lead me in that direction. It just seemed that that's what it was, that she's a kid who… She's 16 or 17, that she is really, developmentally, much younger than that. And, and that's a real fear to say, "Oh, I mean, I did something I'm embarrassed about. And I don't know that I wouldn't do it again." I mean what a horrible feeling for her. So that was… It seemed to me the primary. And again, leads to why she needs this relationship with her mom and… We… You don't see this, but there was a conversation at some point. I think later about… You know, she was fine with the phone being taken away. Because that was the deal and it make sense to her. And she knows her mom was protecting her, and until she could feel that put in the same situation she wouldn't do it again, she thought she probably shouldn't have a phone. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN I think you really need to close us on what that means, and the connections that she might (inaudible ) are an essential part. 

00:28:10
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN And the meaning for (inaudible )… And that's what I like about this clip is. I have lots of ideas about what's going on. And they were… They seemed reasonable at the moment, but they were wrong. It took, it took me about five or six minutes to figure that out with her. Yes? 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) she knows that she actually make that same bad choice again. Would you then bring that relationship into (inaudible ) and encourage her, so that when she does (inaudible ) she can come to her mom and use that relationship to balance what's happening on a, you know, and have that support? 

00:29:00
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN You could. You… The only concern I would have is that there if I said to her, "Now, if something like that happened again, could you, you know, ask your mom." She would say, yes. I mean it. I mean, you know, wouldn't be a… It would be a genuine authentic answer. The issue is in the moment when she's flooded with emotion, I'm not sure, and more importantly, she's not sure she would be able to do that. So again, it's about relationships. And the stronger the connection she develops with her mom, the more likely it is that what you've just said will actually happen. So it's about the relationship. The stronger we make the relationship, the more likely that is to actually happen. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:29:45
ARTHUR-BECKER WEIDMAN Yeah, I mean, we could bring it to her. And then, you know, I might at some point, but yeah, it's about strengthening the relationship. And that was partly my comment about the, you know, her arm and all that, was to, again, bring it to both their awareness that the touch was… was good feel. It made her feel good, she likes it. In fact, do, do that at home and to underscore that that's, that's a valuable part of their relationship. So another, probably, I have time for one more question. No? Okay. Great. Take it away, Dan. Do you have any comments on the tape or your… 

00:30:20
DANIEL HUGHES Uh, sure. A comment is that I think… I think the part… the discussion I heard between you and audience is that, uh, I mean, we could have theories about those things. I'm confident if I get a dialogue with a rhythm going, da-da-da-da, you know, where I was, was just hearing out with her, trying to pull out her experience, make sense of it, how is that affecting her. If it's connected to anything from her past, that would pop up in the next session or the session after. But I don't have to worry about missing stuff that when you get a nice rhythm with a client. And that's… It's co-creating their autobiographical narrative. The narrative itself pressures… builds up inside of a person. And if you safe with a person, you know, these rhythms all the sudden, it pops right out. Or all of a sudden, the kid is primed and you say, "Hey, I was wondering, you know, the, you know, about some of the hard times you had with your past with that the grandfather… Doesn't it kind of confuse you when some boy expresses some sort of an interest in you sexually?" Boom! Then the kid will talk about it. If we sort of move in too quick with interpretations about stuff like that, sometimes the narrative doesn't do its job. It's like we're trying to make it do its job. The narrative will do it. Okay. I want to start with this one. I like this one in terms of… It demonstrates a million things. If we don't have time and a half hour before the break, instead of going to a third one, I'll just finish it after the break. If we do finish it now, great, I'll do another one after. But I want to stay with this one.
