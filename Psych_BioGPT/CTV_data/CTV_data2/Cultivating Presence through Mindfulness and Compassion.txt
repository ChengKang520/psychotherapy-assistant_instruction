UNKNOWN Thank you for taking an hour of your time to explore how self-compassion can enhance therapeutic presence. In uh… Shari Geller's brilliant new book "A Practical Guide to Cultivating Therapeutic Presence" she writes that therapeutic presence is a state of having one's whole self in the encounter with the client. Being a completely in the moment, on the multiplicity of levels, physically, emotionally, cognitively and spiritually. Uh… she says a special aspect of the constructive therapeutic presence, uh… perhaps in contrast to the constructive mindfulness is the overarching goal of… of presence to facilitate deep healing through relationship. She adds that presence is about being in contact with one's self while being in a compassionate relationship with others. So that's where this talk comes in. So how do we facilitate not only a, uh… mindful relationship to ourselves and others but also a compassionate relationship with ourselves and others. So in my view, the secret ingredient is self-compassion. So in the next hour, I'd like to address the following questions. What is self-compassion, what is the relationship of mindfulness to self-compassion? How can self-compassion help to alleviate compassion fatigue? And how can self-compassion support therapeutic presence during the clinical hour? And finally what is the role of equanimity in maintaining presence? So I'd like to start with a, uh… simple reflection. So imagine for a moment that you have a close friend who's struggling, had a misfortune, failed or felt inadequate. How would you respond? So what words might you use, what would be your tone, your physical posture? When a close friend is struggling, what are you like? How do you relate? 

00:02:35
[sil.] 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN And now think for a moment about how you might relate to yourself when you struggle, when you fail or you feel incompetent? What goes on in your own mind? How do you relate to yourself? 

00:03:00
[sil.] 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN So you might have already noticed that there is often a difference between, uh… reactions towards others and towards ourselves. Umm… I have a friend who said, you know if I treated others the way, I treat myself, I probably wouldn't have any friends. Umm… so that brings us to the informal, uh… definition of self-compassion. Self-compassion means treating ourselves with the same kindness and understanding, uh… when we struggle as we would treat a good friend or as we would like a good friend to treat us. This is easier said than done. Why? Because when things go wrong in our lives, uh… we often have what we call a unholy, uh… trinity of reactions. Uh… we often criticize ourselves, you know, you shouldn't have done that or what's the matter with you. We isolate ourselves, we believe that, umm… often we feel shame and we hide either from ourselves or from others and we also become self-absorbed which means that we get kind of stuck in our heads. Why me, why not… why do this happen, happened to me. We become uh… rather small package. So this actually is unfortunate. It's a reaction but it's, it's not, umm… uh… we come by it honestly, so to speak because when, uh… things go wrong in our lives, we feel threatened and when we feel threatened, uh… particularly from the outside, we have a fight, flight, freeze response. But when the threat is from the inside, when we are threatened with, uh… shame or grief or despair, that fight becomes self-criticism, flight becomes self-isolation and freeze becomes self-absorption. So what is self-compassion? So Kristin Neff in 2003, operationally defines self-compassion as having three key components. Self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness and what we may notice is that those three components are exactly the opposite of that unholy trinity. Self-kindness, rather than self-criticism, umm… humanity rather than self-isolation. And mindfulness rather than self-absorption. So we have a colleague, uh… named Mitchell Becker who said, you know, those three components of self-compassion in a nutshell can be called loving, connected presence. Loving connected presence, self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. So uh… perhaps uh… you might like to have a felt sense of what of… of uh… these three components of self-compassion. So what I'd like to invite you to do, uh… is to, uh… make some fists, just like this, nice tight fists. And just notice as you're doing this how you feel, particularly, what emotions arise for you. Right, so maybe you feel a kind of tension, fear, anger, strength. This is often how we go through our lives, more than we want to. This is what we call resistance and so now open your hands like this and drop into your body and perhaps notice what kind of emotions arise when you have this gesture. So you might find, for example, that you're feeling some peace, some openness, some receptivity. So this is what we call a gesture of mindfulness, the first component of self-compassion. And then, perhaps, extend your arms out like this and kind of feel into the posture and even allow your eyes to close and ask yourself, oh, what am I feeling now, what emotions in particular am I feeling? And you may notice that sometimes, uh… you could be having a feeling of caring, of holding, of receptivity, of connection, of embracing. So this is what we call, uh… the gesture of common humanity. Uh… It's a way of being in connection with others in a caring way. And then finally, please put one hand over another and place it on your chest. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN And drop into your body and notice how that feels. What kind of emotions arise for you in this posture, for this gesture. So often people will share comments like oh, there is a sense of refuge of love, of peace, of ease, of kindness, of being held. So this is what we call a gesture of self-kindness. So together the experience of these three components of self-compassion feel like this, mindfulness, like this common humanity, and like this which is self-kindness. So this is quite different than a threat response which is fight, flight, freeze. So actually what we're doing with self-compassion is we're moving our human physiology from a state of threat to a state of care giving. Threat to care giving. Threat is associated with adrenaline and care giving is more associated with uh… oxytocin and the endorphins. That's the, uh… a shift that we're uh… actuating when we, uh… practice self-compassion. Uh… and to have a better understanding of self-compassion it may help to compare and contrast, uh… self-compassion and mindfulness. So mindfulness is generally understood as, umm… moment to moment non-judgmental awareness and when mindfulness is in full bloom, it is saturated with loving kindness and compassion. Uh… But a scholar John Pickard(ph) called loving kindness the beating heart of mindfulness. So we say that loving kindness is the attitude, warmhearted attitude of… of, umm… of mindfulness. Uh… so then what's compassion? So compassion is, uh… what happens when loving kindness meets suffering and stays loving, so there is a monk in Myanmar who said, uh… when the sunshine of love and kindness meets the tears of sorrow, the rainbow of compassion arises. However, sometimes the rainbow of compassion does not arise when we experience sorrow, when we are wrapped in dread or despair or shame. So we go from a sense of, I don't want this feeling to I, uh… uh… shouldn't have this feeling to I'm wrong to have this feeling, to I'm bad and when we feel bad, uh… there is a whole host of negative self, umm… core beliefs, negative core beliefs that arise such as, you know, I'm defective, I'm unlovable, I'm basically alone, I'm helpless. I'm inadequate. I'm a failure. And this is where self-compassion practice comes in. Our sense of self that needs to be rescued before we can be mindful, when we are caught up in these thoughts, we really cannot pay attention to what's going on around us. Sometimes we need to hold ourselves before we can hold our experience. So some ways distinguish uh… mindfulness and self-compassion and mindfulness and self-compassion really go well together are mindfulness is more about loving awareness of moment to moment experience and self-compassion is loving awareness of the experience. Umm… mindfulness… mindfulness asks what am I experiencing? And compassion asks, what do I need? Mindfulness says uh… feel your suffering with spacious awareness and it will change. And self-compassion says, be kind to yourself in the midst of suffering and it will change. So for example, if you say to a mindfulness teacher, you know, my heart is breaking, the teacher might tend to really say, I'm so sorry. Do you think, you can make some room for the pain, do you think, you can hold the pain, perhaps, in a more spacious way allowing it to be there if not perhaps just for now? And a compassion teacher might say, I'm so sorry, umm… what do you think, you need right now? How could you be kind to yourself? So you can see that these responses are both saturated with kindness with warmth but one folk is more an experienced and the other more on the experience. So compassion is more of what we call a, umm… attend to a personal relationship. It's either self to other, uh… or self to self. Jack Cornfield wrote, I used to think umm… that to become free, you have to practice like a samurai warrior. But now I understand that you have to practice like a devoted mother of a newborn child. It takes the same energy but has a completely different quality. It's compassion and presence rather than having to defeat the enemy in battle. So compassion is personal. Some mindfulness practitioners worry that self-compassion will strengthen the sense of self, you know, it's called self-compassion. Uh… but I like to say that, uh… mindfulness dismantles the self by focusing on moment to moment experience whereas compassion, umm… melts the self by warming up awareness. So they are both creating a kind of, uh… more flexible uh… sense of self. Uh… and this idea of melting the self through compassion, I think everybody is, uh… can be knows what this means, for example, when you've been struggling and if somebody comes to you and puts their arm around you and uh… shares some kind words with you, you probably become much less self-absorbed. You're more, you, you begin to relax and you begin to see things with more perspective and clarity. So I like to talk just a little bit about the research because if we're going to go down this road, self-compassion, we need to know that this is a credible path. So there are now over 900, umm… the articles, chapters and dissertations in the psychological literature. Uh… 570 articles actually in peer review, psychological journals and half of, uh… those articles have actually appeared in the last two years. So this is a, this is a burgeoning interest in self-compassion. And uh… on the slide, uh… the year 2016, you notice, there is a little dip but that's just because the year is not over yet. That uh… exponential increase in… in uh… publications is continuing. Uh… So the research started in, uh… 2003 when Kristin Neff operationalize self-compassion and made a scale to measure it. Uh… however, uh… Mark Leary who is professor of psychology in neuroscience at Duke University says that the research in self-compassion, uh… is actually, uh… almost getting boring. Because so many measures of well-being are associated with self-compassion. So self-compassion is consistently associated with less anxiety and depression, including less stress, rumination, thought suppression, shame, perfectionism. People with self-compassion showed more life satisfaction, autonomy, self-confidence, wisdom, happiness, optimism, creativity, intrinsic motivation, conscientiousness, better relationships, positive health behaviors. So you know what, Mark Leary is talking about just by every measure of emotional well-being that we have correlates with self-compassion. There are also, umm… umm… self-compassion associated with positive health behaviors, such as intrinsic motivation to exercise, less alcohol use, reduce smoking, less binge eating, less caregiver burnout, improved heart rate variability, better immune system functioning and general, and generally better health overall. So list goes on and on. You can actually, if you like to see an up to date, uh… bibliography of self-compassion research, you can go to Kristin Neff's website which is at the end of your, uh… slides. Uh… the research is also starting to show that self-compassion is a core mechanism of change in psychotherapy across… across uh… theoretical orientations. For example, uh… after short term psychodynamic treatment, uh… decreases in anxiety, shame and guilt and increases in the willingness to experience sadness, anger and closeness were associated with higher levels of self-compassion. So people felt, they had a kind of internal resource, capacity to hold these experiences. Uh… In mindfulness based intervention, self-compassion has been shown to mediate, to reduce stress in mindfulness space stress reduction and lower depression and mindfulness based cognitive therapy. There is also a whole model of therapy called compassion focused therapy, developed by Paul Gilbert and colleagues in the United Kingdom that is based on, uh… training self-compassion. Most of the research is uh… co-relational. Uh… so in 2010, Kristin… Kristin Neff and I developed a uh… eight week program uh… called mindful self-compassion or MSC to teach self-compassion and in a randomized controlled trial, we found that uh… participation, participants uh… showed increases in self-compassion, mindfulness and compassion for others. Decreases in depression, anxiety, stress, and emotional avoidance. Uh… Increases in social connectedness, life satisfaction, happiness and all these gains were maintained one year later and self-compassion even increased between uh… six months and one year later. And uh… one thing, it's important to know is that most effects of these mind training programs are those dependent, we found that, umm… uh… that participants self-compassion level uh… increased significantly uh… depending on how much they practiced. So umm… now I would like to teach you a meditation from the MSC program that enhances, uh… compassionate presence and it's called giving and receiving compassion. And a downloadable, uh… recording of this meditation can be found on my website. Uh… uh… and on the center for MSC website. So giving and receiving compassion is a, uh… core meditation of MSC and it's also, uh… helpful uh… foundation for compassionate listening and also for managing compassion fatigue. So after we do, uh… this exercise together then uh… we will talk about those subjects, compassionate listening and compassionate fatigue and integrate this practice uh… in uh… those areas. So I would like you, uh… to join me in this, umm… meditation if you like. Uh… it will be guided as a meditation and it is a meditation but you can also practice this informally, uh… throughout your day anyway you like. So uh… to begin if it feels right for you, please, uh… find a comfortable place to sit and allow your eyes to close partially or fully. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Then if you wish, putting a hand over your heart or some other place, some other soothing place. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN As a reminder, that we're bringing not just awareness but loving awareness to our experience and to ourselves. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN And then begin by taking a few deep relaxing breaths and notice how you're breathing. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Notice, how you're breathing nourishes your body as you breathe in. And relaxes your body as you breathe out. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN And then allowing your body, your breathing to find its own natural rhythm. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN As you continue to feel the sensation of breathing in and breathing out. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN And now focusing your attention primarily on your in breath and letting yourself savor, this sensation of breathing in. How it nourishes the body. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN How it energizes the body. One breath at a time. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN As you breath in also perhaps breathing in something good for yourself. Something that you may need, so maybe you need a little extra love today or some peace or some strength, as you breathe in, you know, breathing in that quality, whatever it is that you need. Breathing it in and then just releasing your breath. 

00:24:40
[sil.] 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN And now shifting your attention to your out breath. Noticing how it feels to breath out. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Noticing a sense of relaxation or ease that is accompanied, that accompanies the out breath. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN And now please call to mind… please call to mind someone whom you love or someone you know who needs compassion. Clearly visualizing someone. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN And feeling your exhalation, feeling your out breath and as you breath out, sending something good to that person. With every out breath, sending either the ease with an out breath or maybe something that they need. Something good. One out breath after another. 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN And now letting go… letting go of what umm… that person may need or what you may need but continuing to feel your breath, continuing to feel the physical sensation of breathing and this time the sensation of both breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and out. And as you breathe in, breathing in for yourself. And as you breathe out breathing out for that other person. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN So continuing to hold that other person in your mind's eye. But also holding yourself in your mind's eye and breathing in for yourself and out for the other. 

00:28:25
[sil.] 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN In for me, and out for you. In for me and out for you. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN One for me and one for you. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN And if you like, you can focus a little more on yourself breathing in a few for your, yourself. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Or you may wish to breath out a few for other focusing more on the out breath, focusing more on the in breath. Whatever you need. But always allowing the in breath to be for yourself and the out breath to be for another. 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN And really allowing your breath to flow in and out, just like the gentle movement of the ocean the way waves flow in and the waves flow out. Just like the ocean, perhaps allowing yourself to be part of that ocean. Letting your body… breath quite naturally, letting your breath breathe you. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN The breath going in for me and out for you. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN Limitless, boundless flow. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN And if you like, letting yourself really be part, be part of this limitless, boundless flow. Part of the ocean. An ocean of compassion, an ocean of compassion in for me, and out for you. 

00:31:30
[sil.] 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN And now releasing the practice, you can always return to it whenever you wish. Releasing the practice and just sitting in your experience for a moment. Letting your body feel, whatever it feels. Also allowing yourself to be just as you are. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN And then when you're ready ever so gently opening your eyes. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Perhaps, getting yourself the privilege of… privilege of, uh… knowing what that exercise would like for you. What you felt? What was it like to breath in for yourself and nourish yourself. What was it like to breath out for another, to nourish another? What was it like to be in connection in this way? And a natural connection without trying. Perhaps you notice that you actually want to breath in more for yourself. We want to breathe out more for another. So this exercise is something, sometimes called umm… loving others without losing ourselves. So it's a way of, uh… taking care of ourselves, a way of practicing self-compassion in relationship. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Okay, umm… so this practice, uh… giving and receiving uh… uh… giving and receiving compassion can be applied during uh… therapy sessions to cultivate, umm… compassionate uh… connection and presence. In particular uh… what we call uh… compassionate listening. So Jan Surrey(ph) will have spoken in this course about, uh… relational mindfulness, about mindful listening and so I would like to offer you uh… some uh… strategies for cultivating in particular this element of compassion, compassionate listening. So imagine that you're in a therapy session with a client and umm… and you would like to listen more compassionately so there are three elements, uh… to consider. The first one is to, uh… wait before speaking. So instinctively when someone is struggling, we uh… wish it weren't so and sometimes we automatically speak words of comfort or kindness. Uh… maybe we wish to, umm… help a person not to feel so alone. But when we do this, when we speak sometimes even out of the goodness of our hearts, it, it tends to, uh… fill up our mental space, ours and our clients and it leaves less room for really listening to what the client is trying to say. So we have this little acronym wait and that means, why am I talking? So uh… the first element of compassionate listening is to wait before speaking. The second element is what we call embodied listening. So what is embodied listening? We often listen, uh… with our ears and with our eyes but embodied listening actually means when we have the space to do it, when we don't have to be talking, to actually, uh… letting out awareness inhabit our bodies and to feel with our bodies what our clients are saying. So one of the definitions of compassion is… is like uh… two leaves fluttering in the same wind. So as you're listening to one of your clients speaking, see if you can allow your body to feel precisely what your client's body is feeling. Allow your leaf to flutter in the same wind as their leaf. So that's the second part. Uh… embodied listen, the third part is giving and receiving compassion what we just did, uh… the breath practice. So when we listen in an embodied way to someone, our minds will naturally wander. Uh… there are so many reasons for this. Uh… one is, the main one is because that's what the mind does. It wanders. Umm… however, in order to understand what somebody is saying, we naturally have to associate from our own, uh… wealth of experience to what the person is saying and sometimes we get caught in a bit of reverie about what a person is saying and we're not paying attention anymore. Sometimes what a person is saying is perhaps emotionally activating and we just distract ourselves because we want to kind of temper the experience. So when we notice, uh… when our mind has wandered, what can we do, what can we do to return to connection through our own bodies and to return to connection with our client? And this is giving and receiving compassion, this uh… meditation practice with the breath. So while you're, umm… doing therapy, allow yourself to be aware of your breath and the background. This is a really stabilizing practice for, uh… clinicians to be aware that you're breathing at any given time and when you notice that you've really gone off, with the in-breath allow that in-breath to be for yourself and with the out breath allow the out breath to be for your client. So umm… let me give you an example. Uh… what is your first reaction when a client tells you and this may have happened to you, it's certainly happened to me. Tells you they have been stockpiling, uh… medications, maybe they are on the night table next to their bed and they feel, the client feels ready to take those medications, uh… when they need to. In other words, this is suicide threat or suicide, suicidal ideation. What is your first reaction when, when you hear that? Well, naturally, you're gonna feel afraid, you're gonna feel threatened. And one of the natural thing that happens when you feel threatened, well you want to stop it, you want to stop the threat. So you immediately start thinking of, you know, how can I prevent this and we, you know, might have the instinct to immediately ask our client to, you know, contract for safety and so forth and what's the up shot to that, if that's the first thing we do? It usually drives the client away. Next, the client feel more alone, more isolated, more despairing. So in that moment, what would happen if instead of doing those natural reactive threat based responses, we actually start a care giving. First we started taking care of ourselves by breathing in for ourselves and then we started caring for our client by breathing out for the client. Comforting ourselves with in-breath and connecting with the client in the out-breath and then when we have reestablished connection, exploring what the client is actually feeling and also gently enquiring perhaps… perhaps collaboratively about alternatives. So I've been in this situation a number of times and I found that breathing in and out as a might say a safety net, when I uh… no longer in connection with the client has worked really well, uh… to keep us in relationship. And it has worked, worked out to keep clients safe. So those are the three components that we like to offer particularly in the mindful self-compassion training program, uh… for compassionate listening. Wait before speaking, listen in an embodied way and when you notice your mind has wandered, compassionate breathing in for me and out for you. Which brings us, uh… to the last topic that I would like to address which is, uh… caregiving fatigue sometimes called compassion fatigue or burn out. So just about everyone who's taking this course is a professional caregiver and probably most everyone has been exhausted from, uh… time to time. So care-giving fatigue is not a weakness. Care giving fatigue is actually a sign of being human. So being human means that we have a social brain and we can feel the pain of others. So you know, the therapy profession is rather weird in so far as we're actually choosing to spend so much of our lives feeling the vicarious, uh… feeling vicariously the pain of others but sometimes it's just too much. So what, what happens when it becomes, uh… too much. Typically, we're advised to practice self care to alleviate care giving fatigue. So what kind of self care activities are usually encouraged when we suffer from care giving fatigue? So we're often told we should umm… take time off, spend more time with friends, exercise, eat well, get a message. Umm… and all these self care strategies are really quite important but uh… what's the limitation of these strategies? And uh… the main limitation is that it's actually off the job. So if you go off and have a nice vacation Martinique, when you come back, you know you're probably gonna drop into the same situation and how quickly do you become fatigued again. So this really begs the question, uh… how can I recharge my batteries on the job while doing therapy? So compassion maybe an answer. So you maybe saying oh, God, you know try telling a burnt out clinician that what they need when they have compassion fatigue is more compassion. Uh… you might lose your friends and your colleagues if you were to say such a thing. Umm… but the reason, uh… why compassion may actually be the answer to compassion fatigue is, uh… lies in the difference between empathy and compassion. So Carl Rogers defined empathy as an accurate understanding of another's world as seen from the inside, to sense another's world as if it were your own. So compassion is, uh… so that's empathy and compassion is kind of empathy plus love. Umm… compassion is a deep and tender wish for the other person to be free from suffering. It's actually a positive emotion, it's… it's mostly love, it's energizing. Empathy says I feel you and compassion says, I hold you or I love you. Uh… so to explore the difference between empathy and compassion, neuroscientists, uh… Tania Singer and Olga Klimecki in… in Leipzig, Germany trained people for several days to activate empathy or compassion and then show them a short film, uh… depicting other's suffering and the films activated, uh… distinctly different brain networks, only compassion training activated networks associated with positive emotions, reward, and care giving. So when we just feel uh… empathic pain, the brain actually registers pain. But when we add, uh… when we meet that pain with kindness, which is compassion, actually something quite different happens in the brain and also as self-experienced. So we can say that umm… usually when we are talking about compassion fatigue we're actually talking about empathy fatigue, uh… and that compassion is really something quite different. So how do we start to enhance our capacity for compassion when we are suffering from empathy fatigue and the answer may again be in self-compassion. So to quote the Dalai Lama, he said, for someone to develop genuine compassion toward others, first he/she must have a basis upon which to cultivate compassion. And that basis is the ability to connect to one's own feelings. So that's mindfulness, isn't it? The ability to connect to one's own feelings. And it says, and to care for one's own welfare and to care for one's own welfare. So that's self-compassion. Caring for others requires caring for oneself. Umm… so when we begin to apply self-compassion to alleviate empathy fatigue or caregiver fatigue, uh… we usually add another element and this is equanimity and I believe that Susan Pollock(ph) will say a lot more about that, uh… in her presentation in this course. But equanimity refers to maintaining mental balance in the midst of opposites such as pain and pleasure, success and failure, joy and sorrow. And equanimity is often the fruit of mindfulness practice, uh… it's kind of a spaciousness, spacious awareness. But, but it can also be directly cultivated using uh… phrases. Many other ways but one way is using phrases such as the serenity prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things, I… I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Just hearing that, doesn't it create a kind of a spaciousness inside? So I'd like to invite you to do is to do a short experiential exercise with me and this is called compassion with equanimity. So first, umm… I'd like you to bring to mind, uh… client of yours who is exhausting you. Who you actually kind of don't want to see. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN And then close your eyes and clearly visualize this person in your mind's eye. And notice… notice how it feels in your body just to be doing this, just to be visualizing this person. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN You may notice some stress or discomfort. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN And now feel your breath in your body. Feeling how your body naturally breathes in and naturally breathes out.

UNKNOWN And allow yourself to breathe in for yourself because it is difficult to be working with this person breathing in for yourself and now also breathing out… out for your client. In for yourself and out for your clients.

UNKNOWN Really, feeling the lusciousness of breathing in because you need it and breathing out.

UNKNOWN And as you're doing this, I'd like to, uh… read some equanimity phrases… phrases uh… that you can perhaps just allow to roll through your mind as you continue to breathe in for yourself and out for your challenging client. And that is that everyone is on his/her own life journey, everyone is on his/her own life journey. I am not the cause of this person's suffering. I am not the cause of this person's suffering nor is it entirely in my power to make it go away even though I wish I could. Moments like these are difficult to bear yet I may still try to help if I can. 

00:51:15

00:51:20
UNKNOWN So continue to breathe in for yourself and out for your client.

00:51:30
UNKNOWN And just once again considering the words everyone is on his/her own life journey. I am not the cause of this person's suffering nor is it entirely within my power to make it go away. Even though, I wish I could. Moments like this are difficult to bear. Yet, I may still try to help if I can.

UNKNOWN So now please open your eyes. And giving yourself a moment to reflect, what did you notice when you said those phrases? What did you notice when you breathe in for yourself and out for your client? So breathing in for yourself was self-compassion, out for your client compassion for others. And the phrases, equanimity phrases often give just a little bit of space. A little bit of room, room to breathe, help us to disentangle a little bit because when we feel entangled, then we struggle and when we struggle, we get exhausted. So that's the power of compassion, especially self-compassion with equanimity and this can be practiced, uh… any time uh… as you are engaged in the psychotherapy process. There is a palliative care physician named Michael Kearney(ph) who said that, umm… uh… self care without awareness and kindness is like keeping ourselves from drowning, from drowning underwater whereas self care with kindness is like learning to breathe underwater. So self-compassion and equanimity may help us to breathe underwater. So before I close, I would, umm… like to read a few quotes that capture the radical invitation of, uh… self-compassion for compassionate presence. So uh… please put on your uh… therapy hats as I read these lines and maybe even ask yourself is this therapy? So many of the people who are, uh… participating in this course, you know, you might have been in therapy for many, many years or many of you might have been practicing meditation for quite a few years. But uh… children shared with us the following thought and that is that we can… we can still be crazy after all these years. We can still be angry after all these years. We can still be timid or jealous or have feelings of unworthiness after all these years. Feelings unworthiness isn't, are we supposed to make that goal away, you know. Isn't self-compassion supposed to make unworthiness go away, isn't psychotherapy supposed to? What it would be like actually that we, we would still have feelings of unworthiness after all these years. And she… she says the point is not to throw ourselves away and become something better. It's about befriending who we are already. So this is… this is not a new idea. You know, Sigmund Freud, famously said a person should not strive to eliminate his/her complexes but to get in accord with them, right, that's what makes it interesting our neurosis is as long as we have a friendly relationship with our neurosis. Freud understood, we die with our neurosis. So the radical invitation of self-compassion and therapeutic presence is that we stop fixing and that we start caring. So we like to use a paradox, the paradoxical statement "When we suffer, we practice not to feel better but because we feel bad." What this means is, it's kind of like, uh… a child who has, uh… the flu. Imagine you have a child that had the flu, it's a five day flu and all the child's friends took five days, your child is on day one. And your child is lying in bed saying, "Oh, mommy… mommy… mommy. Oh, daddy… daddy… daddy, I feel so bad," and your heart opens and you kindly take care of the child. You're not taking care of the child in order to drive out the flu. You're taking care of the child because your heart just naturally melts. So this is… this is, uh… what we're doing with self-compassion training, we're actually learning an inclination of heart, we're learning a kind of tenderness of heart where rather than fighting and resisting our experience and fighting ourselves, that the heart naturally opens and melts. That's freedom. So when we suffer, we practice not to feel better but because we feel bad. Carl Roger said that "The curious paradox of life is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." This is a radical invitation. What would it be like not to wish that our clients were any different as the foundation for psychotherapy? So Rob Nairn a meditation teacher in Scotland probably said it best. He said that "The goal of practice is to become a compassionate mess." So what is a mess? A mess means to be a fully human, a mess means still uncertain, often struggling but with great compassion. With great compassion to be with others in that way. So I think that might be helpful for therapeutic presence. So thank you for listening.
