Culturally-Competent Counseling and Therapy Sponsored And Produced By The Society For The Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues Division 45 of the American Psychological Association With The Support Of Microtraining Associates Part II: Innovative Approaches To Counseling Asian-American People Demonstrations by: Gayle Iwamasa Frederick Leong Derald Wing Sue 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  We're working on this multicultural counseling tapes. I think you're gonna find the vignettes and discussions on this one particularly helpful. Ah, I'd like to introduce Patricia Arredondo, ah, president-elect of Division 45 of A.P.A. and professor at Arizona State University. Patricia. (crosstalk) 

00:00:35
PATRICIA ARREDONDO Yeah(ph). Thank you, Allen. Yes, and this, ah, series of tapes called Innovative Approaches to Counseling and Psychotherapy from Culture Specific Perspectives. As Allen indicated, we are really giving a lot of focus to multicultural competencies, and this represents a joint venture between Microtraining Associates, Allen's organization, and Division 45, the Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues. This particular tape that you will be, ah, introduced to involves an Asian American perspective in counseling and it includes three participants, Derald Wing Sue, Fred Leong and Gayle Iwamasa. 

00:01:15
ALLEN IVEY  I think you're gonna find this tape stimulating, you know, raise a lot of questions it certainly did with me. Ah, let us begin. 

00:01:25
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Welcome to this, ah, counseling therapy demonstration of, ah, working with an Asian American client. Ah, as many of you know, uhm, from our research, we find that counseling and psychotherapy in the theories of counseling and psychotherapy originate from a cultural context and may be culture bound. Today, what we were going to be demonstrating is a role-played situation between Dr. Fred Leong, uhm, a, a counselor working at the University Counseling Center with, ah, Dr. Gayle, ah, Iwamasa who will be role-playing a 21-year-old, ah, ah, college student, ah, who is coming in for counseling and experiencing, ah, some difficulties in her academic work. Uhm, this session is somewhat artificial and that it is divided into four different segments, uhm, ah, both Dr. Le, ah, Leong and, uhm, ah, Gayle will be, ah, role-playing a, a segment in which, ah, I will stop artificially and make process observations as we go along. There are several things that, ah, you as a viewer should be aware of in terms of looking at this role-play. One of them, ah, deals with cultural, racial ethnic factors that interv, of that, in some sense interv, uhm, influence the, ah, counseling session. And there are several, ah, one of them is the differences in communication style that are oftentimes misinterpreted by a traditionally-trained counselor or therapist. Ah, if they do not understand, for example, ah, Asian American counseling or communication styles. Secondarily, ah, it's important to note also that, uhm, ah, many Asian American clients tend to express psychological distress through, ah, different, uhm, ah, frameworks and traditional stating that I have problems. And then thirdly, ah, it's very important for us to tune in to pro, potential nonverbal communication style differences. And, ah, let's begin with the session now. 

00:03:35
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Hello, Gayle. My name is Dr. Leong. From the intake notes, I noticed that you're, ah, senior majoring in Biology, how are things going? 

00:03:45
GAYLE IWAMASA Fine. Uhm, well, I'm, I'm sort of havin' a hard time getting started this semester, and, and some, some of my classes are really boring and, and just school isn't as exciting as it used to be. 

00:04:00
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Sounds like that's a concerned of yours, your difficulty with getting classes started. 

00:04:10
GAYLE IWAMASA Yeah. 

00:04:10
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  That can be discouraging. 

00:04:15
DR. DERALD WING SUE  First of all, uhm, this is a primary example of communication style, potential communication, ah, style differences. You will note that uhm, ah, the client, Gayle, tends to avoid eye contact with the therapist. Now, Euro American counseling and therapies, uhm, it would only interpret, ah, eye contact or avoidance of eye contact as having diagnostic significance and in that deed, that is, uhm, ah, generally true. However, most, ah, interpretations of lack of eye contact tend to be negative in nature, that is at the, uhm, ah, that the client, ah, might be passive, unassertive, depressed, the whole host of varit, uhm, ah, variables. One thing that we have found in our study is that Asians tend to avoid eye contact primarily for one, uhm, ah, dominant reason and that is that eye contact, ah, is avoided with someone who may have higher status, prestige, or is a male, uhm, ah, figure and that this should not be, ah, seen in a negative sense. The other thing that will, ah, come out more evident as we go along is that Gayle is relatively, ah, much more nonverbal in her interactions with the therapist than, uhm, por, potentially with a white client iof you were working, ah, with one. Uhm, ah, nonverbal types, you know, being much more nonverbal and having silences or long latencies between responses are culturally determined in, ah, Euro American society studies find, for example, that their latency of less than three seconds. And if you start counting one, two, three, most people begin talking. Among Asian, ah, and traditional Asian, especially, this does not, uhm, this is not a long latency of response so that the therapist needs to realize that, ah, this pause or silence is not always an invitation for you, the therapist or listener, to take up the conversation. Ah, and lastly, ah, we will, ah, go to, uhm, emphasis more than nonverbal dynamics are involved as the other clips go along. 

00:06:30
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Tell me more about what's been happening. 

00:06:35
GAYLE IWAMASA  (sighs) Well, I mean, it's really not, not a big deal or anything but, uhm, this semester, I've just, I haven't been feeling very well. Uhm, I get headaches a lot and have a hard time sleeping. And I, I went to the student health center, uhm, but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. And so now, my parents are really worried and they call me every day from L.A. and see how I'm doing and I tell them, you know, mom, don't, you know, waste your money. I'm okay. But she says that my health is more important than money. 

00:07:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE Many of the studies on, ah, Asian Americans suggest that, ah, when Asians and Asian Americans encounter psychological distress, they are most likely to express it through somaticizing or through somatic complaints such as, ah, inability to sleep, indigestion, ah, headaches, and a hound, host of other variables. 

00:07:50
GAYLE IWAMASA  Well, I mean, it's really not, not a big deal or anything but, uhm, this semester, I've just, I haven't been feeling very well. Uhm. 

00:08:05
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Now, we don't want a therapist if, if a client comes in, ah, and talks about somatic, ah, difficulties to assume that it is purely psychological and it's important to check this up in a medical sense. But what we want the therapist to be aware of is that indirect ways of expressing psychological conflict, ah, conflicts, uhm, for many Asians and Asian Americans, uhm, tend to be much more appropriate for several reasons. Uhm, the primary reason, ah, that is important to note is that Asians, uhm, ah, have been told from birth that whatever they express or tell to a stranger, ah, is discol, ah, disclosing, ah, family types of conflicts and issues and this is a taboo. And there is great source of shame for people to talk to what is perceived as a counselor or therapist as being a stranger and disclosing this personal information. So, uhm, they are more likely to indirectly express the difficulties through either somaticizing or through education or vocational issues. And the therapist needs to realize and ask a question, "How do I tap in to the feelings of the client? And how do I communicate with the client when they are reluctant to talk about, ah, psychological problems directly but indirectly through, ah, somaticizing?" 

00:09:30
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Parents are like that, aren't they? 

00:09:35
GAYLE IWAMASA Uhm, actually, I worry more about them. 

00:09:40
DR. FREDERICK LEONG In what way? 

00:09:40
GAYLE IWAMASA  Well, we've never been very wealthy and, you know, I'm the oldest. 

00:09:50
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Uhm, what it's like to be the oldest in your family? 

00:09:55
GAYLE IWAMASA  (sighs) I don't know where to begin. We're really close family and my parents immigrated from Korea several years ago and opened a small restaurant. And, uhm, we all work there, me and my three younger brothers. And, uhm, since I was the oldest, ah, I always had a lot of responsibilities and so I kept the books and did the work schedules and order the food. And, and my father said I, I did such a great job, you know, and things run really smoothly when, when I was there. But then, I left for college. So, and sometimes, you know, we did pretty well. We made a decent income. Uhm, but last year is bad. The economy and, and the neighborhood were just really bad and so they had to close the restaurant. And so, well, father is not working now. And all my brothers are, are working to support the family now. 

00:11:20
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Are your brothers going to school as well? 

00:11:20
GAYLE IWAMASA  Uh hmm. My two youngest brothers are, are still in school. Uhm, Jimmy graduated last year, ah, from high school, and, uhm, he's putting off going to college until father can, uhm, find some, some work. And my mom wants to work, uhm, but she has really bad arthritis and it, it's really, really painful. And, well, I, sometimes, she would go and work in the restaurant even though she felt really bad and we'd say, mom, you know, you need to rest, and, and she'd say, well, she was doing it for us kids 'coz she wanted what was best for us. And so she and father saved their money. I didn't know it but they actually were saving up for my college education. And, uhm, when I turned 18, father said that, that, uhm, they had been saving money for all this years and that, that was my birthday present. It was, uhm, a free college education and all I had to do was study. 

00:12:40
DR. FREDERICK LEONG How did that make you feel? 

00:12:40
GAYLE IWAMASA  I don't know. Grateful, I guess. 

00:12:50
DR. FREDERICK LEONG You don't sound too certain. 

00:12:50
GAYLE IWAMASA Yes, I am. Of course, I'd be, what do you mean? 

00:12:55
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Well, I'm the, uhm, oldest of four children in a traditional Chinese family and, uhm, my parents have always given or tried to give us the best. Ah, education has always been very important, you know, my family with, uhm, you know, providing us with the best, making sure that the education was a way for us to succeed in life, make our parents proud and so on. And it's not just financial support, it's all the other intangible things that they provided, too. Ah, for example, whenever I hide in a test or an exam and so on, they would make no demands upon me, didn't give me choirs and so on. They even let me eat in my own room, which is usually not allowed and so on. One time, they actually, uhm, cancel my mother's, ah, birthday celebration, which is a very important family event it was right before my S.A.T. test, didn't have to tell me why I just knew. 

00:14:00
GAYLE IWAMASA I know how that is. And how, how that make you feel? 

00:14:05
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Well, I guess grateful to them but, but at the time, I just felt so obligated and, and trapped. 

00:14:15
GAYLE IWAMASA Trapped? 

00:14:15
DR. FREDERICK LEONG You know, on one hand, I felt like here are my parents trying to give me everything they could, and I really should be grateful for it and so on. On the other hand, it was just, I feel so obligated and guilty... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
GAYLE IWAMASA I am. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...'coz what, I was just, what was I doing? They were giving and giving and I was just taking. 

00:14:35
GAYLE IWAMASA  Uhm, yeah, but what can you do about it? 

00:14:40
DR. DERALD WING SUE  This is a very complex interaction that has just occurred, uhm, ah, a number of areas that we can explore but one of the primary ones that I wanna note immediately is, uhm, ah, the culture specific method by which, ah, Fred is illustrating in his work, uhm, with the client, Gayle, here. Ah, primarily if you look at the, uhm, ah interaction here. Uhm, Fred has engaged in, ah, what we call in traditional counseling in psychotherapy, a therapeutic taboo. He has chosen to, ah, self disclose some thoughts and feelings in his own, ah, personal life. In traditional counseling and psychotherapy, ah, as all of you know who are probably, uhm, ah, undergoing training or who have done work, we're told not that the therapist does not self disclose. 

00:15:35
DR. FREDERICK LEONG My parents have always given or tried to give us the best. Ah, education has always been very important, you know. My family with, uhm, you know, providing us with the best, making sure that education was ah, way for us to succeed in life. Make our parents proud and so on. 

00:15:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Ah, one of the primary things is that, uhm, ah, Fred is using self disclosure as a means to tap into, uhm, ah, Gayle's experiential reality and her feelings. Among many traditional Asian, ah, Americans, restraint of strong feelings is a highly valued, uhm, asset. And what we have here is asking a client directly how they feel, especially a traditional Asian may not tap into the feeling, ah, tone level, so that the therapist, ah, needs to learn alternative ways of how you tap into the feeling tone level so that the client begins to understand, ah, that you understand their world view. Now, there's a number of interactions that occurred in the role-play here that indicates, uhm, that, ah, Fred has done so just by the way of lowering of the tone, ah, of, of Gayle's, ah, voice as Fred begins to talk about, ah, his experiences. Uhm, and in some sense, ah, the comment that, uhm, ah, he made that he should have felt, uhm, ah, obligated but trapped. Ah, I think that this is very much a, uhm, a dilemma that Gayle actually feels as well. And during the debriefing, there are other aspects that we'll talk about but I'd like to return to this other, the another segment of the role-play. 

00:17:15
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  That's a good question. I don't think there's any one solution to every situation. In my case, it took me a long time to work through those feelings. I just couldn't understand how in, one hand, I could feel the love and affection from my parents and be grateful for all the things they were doing for me. Now, on the other hand, felt, uhm, you know, so resentful and anger, angry towards my parents. 

00:17:45
GAYLE IWAMASA Well, it sounds like you must have felt really guilty. 

00:17:50
DR. FREDERICK LEONG I did and I, I felt ashamed too. 

00:17:50
GAYLE IWAMASA  Tsk, yeah, yeah. I sort of feel that way, too, with, you know, my parents and, and my brothers, too, I mean, here I am going to college and not working and, you know, Jimmy putting off, going to school so he can help support the family and, you know, my brothers working after school. 

00:18:25
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Tell me if I understand you correctly. You feel torn between going on for your own graduate studies but you also feel obligated to help your parents out. And if you would have pursue your own career goals, that would be putting yourself ahead of your family and that would be selfish? 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:50
GAYLE IWAMASA  I just don't know what to do. 

00:18:55
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Ah, I didn't either. Not at first, but there are options open to you and I, I found that it's useful to talk to somebody with a different perspective. Is there something you would be interested in trying? 

00:19:15
GAYLE IWAMASA Ah, I could try it. I, I guess it wouldn't hurt. 

00:19:20
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Ah, this is the last and final sequence of the, uhm, ah, role-play. Again, there are just so many issues, ah, ah, to point out that I'm gonna, ah, select just, ah, several, uhm, that I think are especially important for counselors and therapists to be aware of. One of them deals with this particular question that was asked by, uhm, uhm, Gayle of, uhm, of Fred which, ah, was, it must have made you feel, ah, guilty or guilt-ridden. 

00:19:50
GAYLE IWAMASA Well, it sounds like you must have felt really guilty. 

00:19:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uhm, and what happened was that Fred's response was, ah, he agreed, ah, yes and ashamed as well. Uhm, one of the primary, ah, differences among, uhm, many, ah, Euro American groups and Asian American groups is the expression of affect and traditional Euro American culture. If you do something wrong or against which you believe or have been taught, you are likely to feel uhm, ah, ah, of, of aspects of guilt. Uhm, now, uhm, among Asian cultural groups, and I'm talking particularly about traditional Asian cultural groups, if you do something wrong, you may experience feelings of, of guilt all right but you are also likely to, ah, feel experiences of shame. Now, uhm, guilt is an individual affect while shame is a group affect and it's a very important, uhm, ah, distinction to be made because traditional Asians and Asian Americans tend to be much more collectivistic in their orientation, ah, and, ah, while Euro American society tends to be very individualistic in its, uhm, ah, orientation, and this affects not only the expression of affect that the counselor or therapist might misidentify but in some sense might communicate if they stick on the guilt level, communicate a lack of understanding of the world view of a culturally, uhm, ah, different client. Ah, I'd like to just take the opportunity right now to, ah, thank, uhm, ah, both, ah, Dr. Leong and Dr. ah, Iwamasa for, for the role-play here. And I'd like to open it up for discussion among the, ah, three of us just briefly to process, ah, some of your reactions and thoughts, uhm, ah, as we went on, and I wonder, Gayle, you won an Academy Award as I've said, ah, with your role-play. But, uhm, ah, any reactions and thoughts, ah, about this? 

00:21:50
GAYLE IWAMASA I think one of the most important things is that, uhm, the client feel comfortable and not feel like, uhm, she was getting bombarded with lots of questions. Uhm, and it felt more comfortable just to know that somebody else had similar experiences or was understanding where I, as the client, was coming from. 

00:22:20
DR. DERALD WING SUE So you found the slower pacing by, uhm, ah, Fred, ah, comfortable, and his ability to self disclose also... (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
GAYLE IWAMASA Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
DR. DERALD WING SUE ...it made you feel like he understood what was... (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
GAYLE IWAMASA Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE ...going on. 

00:22:30
GAYLE IWAMASA Exactly. 

00:22:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uhm, ah, ah, you know, have you had experiences with, with therapist, ah, in terms of how they pace themselves? In terms of, ah, working with clients. 

00:22:40
GAYLE IWAMASA Uh hmm. I think in particular, something I found, ah, particularly the students in training ha, having a lot of difficulty with the silences ... (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
GAYLE IWAMASA  and feeling like they need to fill in the silences or jump in and immediately say something when the client might actually be thinking or experiencing some sort of emotion and having a hard time communicating that. 

00:23:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
GAYLE IWAMASA  And so I think being able to be comfortable with those periods of silence, uhm, because when Fred did that, uhm, I was able to feel comfortable to continue and actually share what was on my mind as a client where is, if a therapist jumps in right away, then that might, that might've been lost. 

00:23:25
DR. DERALD WING SUE Fred, what about, ah, your decision? Uhm, you know, you and I have been taught all the time. Therapists don't self disclose and you chose to talk about, uhm, ah, some of the similar conflicts that you went through. Uhm, what thoughts do you have about that? 

00:23:40
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Well, I think you know, it, it's, it's a balancing act of, you know, what we've been taught in the Western approaches and so on, but I felt that the most important goal was to use a culturally comfortable, culturally syntonic way to engage the client... (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  and that given, uhm, most Asian Americans difficulty about talking about personal issues, you know, family, problems and so on, that we needed something else to kinda, you know, uhm, take an alternative route to, ah, kinda role play that disclosure and to kinda make it okay... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  to describe some of those difficult experiences and not to be too tied into the traditional approach. 

00:24:25
DR. DERALD WING SUE Yes. You know, I, I immediately picked up, uhm, this, ah, issue of, of Gayle, ah, asking you about, ah, feeling guilty and you acknowledged that you did feel that but you've also said that you feel, felt ashamed as well. Uhm, can you say something about that? Uhm. 

00:24:40
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Yeah. I think as that particular interchange illustrated, uhm, Asians coming from a more collectivistic, uhm, you know, culture have the concerns about, uhm, you know, maintaining face... (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...and, and, and the, the whole issue of filiopiety... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...and so on, and, uhm, the, the conflict that I think many Asian Americans feel with, ah, Asian side of them and in the Western side... (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...and I was trying to, uhm, help her get in touch with the Asian side that, that, you know, that I were, was feeling guilty but also ashamed because my parents had taught me to, you know, do the proper thing and so on and help make the you know, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...family proud but then also feeling that, ah, that, uhm, the tension from this acculturation process of which side do I, do I go with but wanting to acknowledge the Asian side. 

00:25:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE Yeah. You know, what we've just tried to demonstrate here is there a danger in terms of, ah, what we've just done. Ah, we've talked about counseling and therapy with an Asian American. We've illustrated some, ah, principle. What is it down, potential down side that, ah, that could occur as a result of these? 

00:25:50
GAYLE IWAMASA Well, my concern would be, uhm, focusing solely on stereotypes about people and making an assumption that just because Fred and I role-played this one situation that all female, you know, Asian American college students are going to be a particular way. And I think one of the things that, that makes a therapist, ah, not only culturally sensitive but culturally competent is really being able to get a sense of what's going on with that individual in the room and to understand the, the vast, ah, amount of within group differences... (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
GAYLE IWAMASA ...among Asian Americans. So that would, that would be a concern that I would sort of immediately, uhm, want to warn people to not assume that because we focus on some, uhm, typical, traditional, ah, concepts today that this is something that should be applicable across the board with all Asian American clients. 

00:26:50
DR. DERALD WING SUE Good. Is that the way you feel as well, (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
DR. DERALD WING SUE ...uh-huh, Fred? 

00:26:55
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE You know, if you have to give two recommendations, uhm, ah, that would most be helpful to I think, uhm, ah, some of our colleagues who work with, uhm, ah, traditional Asian, Asian American clients, what would they be? 

00:27:05
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Well, I think one of the, the principles that I try to work with is, ah, using, uhm, these differences that we found in, in cross-cultural studies but using it in a dynamic fashion without, you know, locking into a stereotypical fashion. And one of them comes from Ed Hall's work about styles of communication, about high, low context styles of communication. And that most Western Europeans prefer the low context communication styles using amount of words as you are saying with communication styles and silences. And that many Asian cultures use a high context communication styles so that I wanna make sure what Asian American clients that I keep them in the back of my mind and, and watch for these, you know, nonverbal cues, make sure that I'm, I'm with the client with regards to where they're at, you know, cognitively because so much is not said but understood... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...and the importance of the subtlety of communication among Asian Americans. 

00:28:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. Well, again, I wanna thank you both for, ah, participating in these, uhm, ah, demonstration and role-play and I hope the viewers have found these, uhm, ah, equally helpful. And I wanna just, ah, end, uhm, today's, uhm, uhm, session with echoing what, uhm, ah, Dr, ah, Dr. Iwamasa said and that is the issue of stereotyping. It would be very, uhm, ah, destroy the entire integrity of what were trying to illustrate here if, ah, the viewers were to leave with a thought that this is the way all Asian Americans are. Uhm, this depends on, on generational differences, ah, acculturation status, and even the fact that, uhm, you know, we're illustrating a Korean American, uhm, a client coming here. We know that in the United States or something between 29 to 32 distinct identifiable, ah, Asian, Asian American, ah, groups with their own language, culture, ah, values et cetera. And this is a challenge, I think, of multicultural, uhm, ah, counseling, multicultural, ah, psychology is how does one balance the individual uniqueness of clients, ah, the group, uhm, ah, forces and factors that are present, and the similarities or universals that we share. That, I think, is the greatest challenge that we as counselors and therapist face in this, uhm, ah, world of increasing diversity and thank you once again. 

00:29:30
ALLEN IVEY  Well, we just can do a little wind up after we finished here and, ah, kind of what we're doing in most of these tapes is, ah, doing sort of a, (inaudible )one, one kinda standard question, ah, which I'd asked all three of you is that a lot of people looking at this tape are trained in the White European American frame. And, ah, what would you like me to take, ah, to my own work in counseling and therapy, what would you like, ah, ah, people that don't come from the Asian background to take, to take from this? 

00:30:10
DR. DERALD WING SUE See, I've been doing all the talking, so I'm gonna pass the book and allow my two colleagues, ah, to begin (laughs). 

00:30:15
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  Well, one of the things I've been thinking about is that, we really need to look at, uhm, cultural identity at a more complex fashion, that each one of us really have three separate identities, ah, universal identity, those elements we share with all other human beings and so on, so that, you know, there's depression, and depression is ex, experienced across... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:30:35
DR. FREDERICK LEONG  cultures and so on. But we also have a group identity, that's where gender comes in, race ethnicity, and so on. And that's where we're generating these principles of about how to do counseling with Asian Americans, African Americans, and so on. But, ultimately, there's that personal identity, our own individual, unique experiences, learning, histories, background, and so on. And I think we need to keep those three identities in mind and, and use it dynamically in counseling, and, you know, shift back and forth between the two. I think we look in this, as Derald and Gayle was saying, into only the group one and then you can be stuck in the stereotypical... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
GAYLE IWAMASA Yeah. 

00:31:10
DR. FREDERICK LEONG ...cookbook fashion. And you need to always remember ultimately you're coming back to the individual client. 

00:31:15
GAYLE IWAMASA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. They have to stay with the, don't bring in the group dimensions... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Right. 

00:31:20
ALLEN IVEY ...must(ph) become (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:31:21
DR. FREDERICK LEONG You ignore an important dimension. 

00:31:21
ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ). So makes the individual more rich, what... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
ALLEN IVEY ...what I mean to say. 

00:31:25
GAYLE IWAMASA Well, the one thing I'd like add so that, I agree with that, is, is I would also, ah, not want the therapist to get the impression that they need to know everything that there is to know about clients, but that part of the process of doing therapy is to learn about your clients' experiences. So, uhm, I would hope that people wouldn't have the assumption that they need to memorize everything or be able to attend to every subtle nuance, but that if they approach their work with each of their clients individually, as, as Fred had mentioned, and sort of with an attitude of, of wanting to learn about what this person's experiences and being open to that instead of immediately trying to categorize behaviors, experiences, uhm, and the content of what the client is saying. But to look at it in a bigger picture, I think, would be more helpful than trying to memorize rules and regulations about what to do and what not to do in therapy. 

00:32:25
ALLEN IVEY You know, a good, good example from that, Gayle, comes from, ah, ah, I was really kinda, myself frankly kinda hypnotized within myself as you're talking about the issues, ah, ah, with parents, and my story that goes with that is when I was senior, in college, my mother had a severe cancer operation. I was talking about going home and so what can I do to help and so forth. (sighs) Well, the first thing this woman says when she comes out of the operation is, "Allen's got to go back to college". And, ah, still sign to send to chill down, down way. I think there is real differences that I think about your discussion. I think about, my feeling really is guilt, and I had to do it. And it was more of a personal thing. So I think there is that universal, universal-ality... 

00:33:10
DR. FREDERICK LEONG Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
DR. GAYLE IWAMASA Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
ALLEN IVEY  which I experience. And I think you might go a little further with, ah, how would I or somebody that might have had a puerile, puerile experience, self disclose in an appropriate way 'coz there's always a danger, I think, of missing. Well, this is a way, you're at the same experience as me, so therefore, you feel as I felt. 

00:33:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
GAYLE IWAMASA I think the rule of thumb is, is why are you self disclosing to the client? Are you self disclosing because you need to get something off you chest...(crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 Yeah. 

00:33:40
GAYLE IWAMASA ...or are you trying to make a connection? Are you trying to communicate to the client, "Hey, I've been there, I know what that's like." Gosh, and this is how it made me feel. In some sense maybe modeling for the client, it, it's okay for you to be resentful...(crosstalk) 

00:33:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
GAYLE IWAMASA ...or guilty or ashamed or whatever, some of those feelings are. 

00:33:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE  And that's why, I, I totally agree with that. Uhm, you know, asking yourself, ah, why have you elected to self-disclose? And that goes to the basic issue, I think of multicultural, uhm, training that I find is that, uhm, I think all therapist need to understand themselves as racial, ethnic, cultural beings. They have to become aware of their own world view, their own values, prejudices, and, and biases. Uhm, ah, otherwise, if they're unaware of it, that's where I find it, ah, occurring. And, and in Fred's case and working with Gayle to be, you know, to be so concerned about how she interacts or relates to her family with the, going on with the family. Uhm, a person who is very, ah, reason, a very individualistic culture and a therapist who has been taught that individualism is to be valued over, ah, ah, family or group, uhm, and things might interpret Gayle was being immature, ah, too overly dependent, too passive. But if the therapist recognizes that my value, world view is that I value individualism, Gayle values collectivism, and it doesn't, you, you prevent yourself from imposing your standard upon, uhm, a, a client and oppressing them. 

00:35:15
ALLEN IVEY I think that is so important, Derald, that really reminds me something that's become more and more part of me as I work with the, work with you over the years, is that I came to think of myself more as a person in context, and I think about what typically is a therapist might do is what do you want as an individual and as well the family is not important, what do you want? And, ah, I think it's really important to highlight that, ah, you did a collectivity, a connectedness, which I think by the way is really appropriate in all settings.(crosstalk) 

00:35:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY Ah, but this is also a way for us to learn. 

00:35:50
DR. FREDERICK LEONG I think it was illustrated in one part of the role-play, uhm, in terms of feeling guilty and ashamed and that that is a central issue for many Asian Americans, and that this internal conflicts. So there're many levels, the conflict between a mainstream European therapist with one cultural value system, and Asian American client, so that could be that cultural conflict. (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
 Yeah. 

00:36:10
DR. FREDERICK LEONG But then for many Asian Americans, the conflict is also internal, the, my, you know, my American side is feeling guilty, but my Asian side is feeling ashamed, and that how do I deal with this internal cultural conflict, struggle. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY Where I certainly, certainly one stage precipitancy, well, what do you want, ah, what are your goals, ah, and to find your own direction, (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
ALLEN IVEY ...which is really kind about to launch. (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
 Yes. 

00:36:35
ALLEN IVEY Ah, anything else to say. Have we gone on. (crosstalk)
