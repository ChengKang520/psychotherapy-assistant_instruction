JASON KO So, thank you very much for coming by. I know it's like a short notice. 

00:00:00
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Yeah, of course. 

00:00:05
JASON KO I've been feeling anxious already and, and all these side effects are, you know, making me even more anxious and I just don't know what to do. 

00:00:10
SIOBHAN DOHERTY I know. So… 

00:00:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Adverse drug reactions arising from psychotropic medications can be a difficult and trying part of both having and treating a mental disorder. For patients already experiencing the challenges of dealing with a psychological illness, the appearance of additional negative symptoms arising from the very medication designed to treat their disorders can be disheartening and troublesome. These side-effects can cover a wide range of severity, from simply uncomfortable to life-threatening. It is difficult or impossible to predict just how psychotropics will affect any given patient. Because of this, it is vital for the caregiver to be familiar with the various markers of an adverse drug action and the actions to be taken should one arise. 

00:01:05
SIOBHAN DOHERTY Yeah, yeah. I mean, his symptoms are pretty light, which is good but they still gave him a lot of anxiety. So I, I tried to tell him that it was nothing out of the ordinary, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. So hopefully that helps. 

00:01:20
SEAN HARRIGAN An adverse drug event or ADE is generally defined as a side effect anticipated or unanticipated of an administered medication. They usually occur at doses appropriate for prophylaxis, diagnosis, therapy, or for the modification of physiological function. Simply put, these are unintended detrimental reactions to prescribe to medications.

Psychotropic Medications: 

00:01:55
Adverse Drug Reactions 

00:02:00
Generalized Side Effects 

00:02:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Identifying adverse drug reaction is associated with psychotropic medications at the earliest onset can be challenging for caregivers. The majority of these patients receive care on an outpatient basis, such as in a psychiatrist office. This means most of the time, they're not being directly observed by their healthcare providers. Even in an in-patient setting, the initial signs may go unnoticed or be written off as an expected physical, psychiatric or behavior symptom, especially given that unusual behaviors are common among individuals with serious mental health issues. The more the caregiver understands adverse drug reactions, the better they will be at recognizing when ADEs are occurring and following the necessary steps to treat and even prevent them. While some side-effects are largely specific to a certain class of psychotropic medication or even to an individual medication within that class, we will generally be looking at side-effects prevalent among many if not all classes of psychotropic medications. We've organized these side-effects into categories related to body structures or body functions. They are presented in this way for ease of identifying and understand them. However, it is important to remember that, these symptoms can show up seemingly haphazardly, and sometimes in clusters that occur throughout the entire body system. 

00:03:35
MIND/HEAD 

00:03:40
[music] 

00:03:50
SEAN HARRIGAN Headaches, dizziness and drowsiness are common side-effects with all classes of psychotropics. When headaches occur, the caregiver may first suggest non-pharmacological interventions, such as rest and relaxation techniques. The caregiver may also administer prescribed analgesics to help with the pain. If the analgesic fails to relive the pain, the care provider needs to be notified. All patients receiving psychotropic medications should be informed that dizziness and drowsiness or a feeling of being sedated can occur. Until they know how the drug will affect them, caution should be used when operating any machinery, including an automobile, or even when engaging in any potentially dangerous or precarious activity, such as climbing ladders. They should also avoid especially strenuous activity, or those which require alertness. These symptoms largely occur at the early onset of treatment. However, if they persist, it is important to alert the primary physician. The feeling of sedation is most prevalent when taking antidepressants and antipsychotics. When sedation occurs, the patient or caregiver may want to discuss the possibility of a later administration time with the physician, closer to the patient's bedtime. If this is the case, the patient may want to keep a night-light in the event sedation or dizziness occurs at night. The physician may also decide to decrease the dosage or find a less-sedating drug altogether. On the other side of the spectrum, some medications including SSRIs, SNRIs and antipsychotics may cause insomnia. In this case, taking the drug earlier in the day can help patients sleep better at night. These patients should also avoid caffeinated food or drinks. And it may be useful to learn relaxation techniques that they can practice before bedtime. 

00:05:55
VISUAL 

00:06:00
[music] 

00:06:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Blurred vision is among one of the anticholinergic effects, symptoms that include dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention, all of which we will look at later in the program. Anticholinergic effects are prevalent especially in the typical antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants. When blurred vision occurs, the patient should be told that the symptoms will likely dissipate after a few weeks. And that he should avoid driving or operating machinery while experiencing these symptoms. It is also important that small objects be cleared from walking areas to prevent falls. If the individual is an out-patient, this is an important part of patient-family teaching. Photosensitivity is another side-effect that causes over-sensitivity to light. If this patient is experiencing acute ocular brightness, instruct him to wear sunglasses outdoors. 

00:07:05
SKIN 

00:07:10
[music] 

00:07:15
SEAN HARRIGAN Drug-induced photosensitivity can also affect the skin. If this occurs, instruct the patient into the use of sunscreen and the need for protective clothing when outdoors. Other adverse reactions for the skin include itching, erythema or redness, irritation, swelling or urticarial lesions. In some cases, these will go away spontaneously, meaning that no intervention is needed. However, if the patient is on antipsychotics, it is important to report any reactions to the physician. Any patient taking the anticonvulsant lamotrigine, Lamictal needs to know to report the appearance of a rash immediately, although a relatively infrequent occurance, a lamictal rash can result in permanent skin damage, vision loss, and even death. Coadministration with valproic acid, depakene, or divalproex, depakote can increase the risk of this serious rash. 

00:08:30
GI SYSTEM 

00:08:35
[music] 

00:08:45
SEAN HARRIGAN Gastrointestinal upset can occur across all classes of psychotropic medications but serving the medication along with food may help to ease or eliminate stomach upset. With antipsychotic concentrates, it may be helpful to dilute the medication and serve with juice or other liquids. These concentrates should also be mixed right before they are taken by the patient. For constipation, most patients will find relief if they increase their fluid intake, get regular physical activity within their range of tolerance, and eat a diet high in fiber. AN OTC or over the counter stool softener such as DSS, Docusate taken with a liberal amount of water may also be considered. 

00:09:35
URINARY SYSTEM 

00:09:40
[music] 

00:09:45
SEAN HARRIGAN The patient should be instructed to report any trouble urinating to their physician. In take and output is to be monitored if trouble voiding or urinary retention occur. Polyuria, an increased output of urine, may occur in patients receiving lithium. Intake output, and daily weights should be performed when this side-effect occurs or is suspected and skin turgor should be monitored. Polyuria usually subsides after the first week or two but can lead to dehydration if ignored. 

00:10:20
ORAL 

00:10:25
[music] 

00:10:35
SEAN HARRIGAN Dry mouth is another one of the most commonly occurring adverse reactions related to psychotropic medications. To help with this, the caregiver can provide sugarless candy or gum and ice chips and instruct the patient to sip water throughout the day. It is also necessary to remind the patient of the need for strict oral hygiene when experiencing these symptoms to avoid tooth and gum issues as well as bad breathe. With clozapine, clozaril, patients may experience hypersalivation. 

00:11:10
JASON KO This is the issue. I have right now like somehow it's my, my mouth just keeps salivating. 

00:11:15
SEAN HARRIGAN This must be treated with care and sensitivity as not only can this pose a danger of aspiration if the symptom is severe enough, it can also be embarrassing for the patient. Sugarfree gum may help to increase the swallowing rate. When severe, the patient's physician may prescribe certain medications to ease the problem. 

00:11:40
SIOBHAN DOHERTY …see if that helps that, a various symptoms. 

00:11:40
JASON KO Okay. 

00:11:45
HORMONAL/SEXUAL 

00:11:50
[music] 

00:11:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Psychotropic medications can cause hormonal imbalances that result in physical changes including alterations in appetite and weight as well as sexual dysfunction. For men, decreased libido, retrograde ejaculation, and gynecomastia or the benign enlargement of breast tissue may arise. Women may experience amenorrhea, or the lack of menstruation. Sexual dysfunction can occur in both sexes. Men may experience abnormal ejaculation or impotence while women may report delay or cessation of orgasm. These symptoms can be very distressing. It can be helpful to tell the patients that these effects aren't permanent and if necessary, suggest they discuss the problems with the physician to see if a change in medication might be helpful. It is also important to remind women to continue using contraception even while experiencing amenorrhea since the lack of menstruation may not mean that ovulation has ceased. 

00:13:00
BRENNAN KELLEHER I'm gonna do it. 

00:13:05
SEAN HARRIGAN Increased appetite and weight gain are also very common among patients on psychotropic medications. For this reason, it is important to weigh the patient every other day. If weight gain is an issue, the caregiver and patient can work with a dietician to design a low calorie diet. The caregiver can also talk to the patient about increasing their physical activity and can help them to find an exercise program or a trainer. When taking SSRIs and SNRIs, the patient may experience weight loss in the early stages of treatment. It is important to help with the patient's diet if this becomes an issue. Making sure that they're getting the necessary calories for their appropriate body weight. The patient's weight should be monitored at appropriate intervals and care should be taken with patients on these medications who have history of anorexia. 

00:14:00
CARDIOVASCULAR 

00:14:05
[music] 

00:14:10
SEAN HARRIGAN Cardiovascular side effects include hypertension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, pulse irregularities, and tachycardia. If these occur, the physician must be notified and the patient's vital signs monitored regularly even as an outpatient. The physician may give more specific parameters and instructions for monitoring depending on the patient and the prescribed agent. The physician will often decrease the doze of the medication and may change to another medication if cardiovascular side effects persists. Orthostatic hypertension may also occur. If the patient experiences this, they should be instructed to sit and stand slowly. If in the hospital, the nurse should monitor the patient's blood pressure every shift both lying down and standing. The patient should also be instructed to avoid long hot showers, baths or hot tubs. 

00:15:10
[music] 

00:15:15
OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS 

00:15:20
[music] 

00:15:25
SEAN HARRIGAN There can be a reduction in the seizure threshold in patients receiving a combination of antipsychotics, anticyclic antidepressants particularly for those patients with a history of seizures. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on seizure precautions if there has been seizure activity or an increase in neurologic irritability. Seizures can be especially prevalent with higher doses of the antipsychotic clozapine, clozaril. And the norepinephrine dopamine re up taken hebitor bupropion, wellbutrin. And so the caregiver should be on the alert with patients who have been prescribed with these medications. Regardless of the severity of the patient's symptoms, these adverse reactions need to be handled with sensitivity and care. For a patient seeking treatment for a mental disorder, the appearance of such symptoms can be met with frustration, confusion and resentment. And can make the patient want to forgo treatment altogether. The caregiver can make all the difference in helping the patient whether challenges, guiding them through the negative aspects of their medication so that they can experience all of the potential benefits of treatment.
