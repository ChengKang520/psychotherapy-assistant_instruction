Evidence-Based Treatment Planning for Social Anxiety 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN The following is a presentation of John Wiley & Sons. It's part of an informative series about empirically informed treatment planning. This program focuses on social anxiety disorder.

00:00:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Hello and welcome. I'm Art Jongsman and joining me is my colleague Dr. Tim Bruce. Today we're going to discuss empirically informed treatment planning for social anxiety disorder. 

00:00:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE This program's divided into a number of modules. 

00:01:00
In This Program 

00:01:00
*DSM Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 

00:01:00
*Essential Elements of Treatment Planning 

00:01:00
*Brief History of the EST Movement 

00:01:00
*Empirically Informing a Treatment Plan 

00:01:00
*Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:01:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE We'll describe the DSM criteria for social anxiety disorder, discuss the essential elements of the treatment planning process, provide a brief history of the empirically supported treatment or EST movement and discuss how to empirically inform a treatment plan with findings from the EST literature on social anxiety disorder. Finally, we'll spend some time discussing common considerations in relapse prevention. 

00:01:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Before we get started, one thing should be noted. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how a treatment plan can be empirically informed. We'll show to incorporate goals, objectives and treatments interventions that are consistent with those of identified ESTs. You'll also see brief scenarios that demonstrate aspects of the EST interventions described. It's important to note that these scenarios and this program in general are designed to be educational in nature and not intended to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed. For those interested in learning more about the ESTs presented, references to their empirical support, clinical training materials and training opportunities are provided in your workbook. So let's get started. 

00:02:10
DSM Criteria for SAD 

00:02:10
*Persistent fear of social situations 

00:02:10
*Fear of being humiliated or embarrassed 

00:02:10
*Anxiety or panic in response to the social situation 

00:02:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's begin by looking at the features and diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder or SAD for short. SAD is an anxiety disorder marked by a persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations where the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny and negative evaluation by others. The individual often fears that he or she will show anxiety or act in some way that will result in humiliation or embarrassment. This unreasonably strong fear often provokes anxiety of various intensities depending on the situation. 

00:02:45
*Avoidance or endurance with great distress 

00:02:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Persons with SAD know that their fear is excessive or unreasonable. Despite this, they typically avoid feared situations or endure them with intense anxiety or distress. 

00:02:55
Performance Situations 

00:02:55
*Speaking in public *Formal (large groups) *Informal (small groups) *Writing in front of others *Eating in front of others *Playing an instrument *Playing sports *Entering a room *Using a public toilet 

00:02:55
Interactional Situations 

00:02:55
*Socializing *Going to a party *Making "small talk" *Eating lunch with peers *Dating *Asking a teacher for help *Speaking to a boss at work *Asking a salesclerk for help *Asking for directions 

00:02:55
Social Anxiety Disorder 

00:02:55
Significant interference with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning; or social activities or relationships; or there is marked distress about having the social anxiety 

00:03:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA These situations may include social performance demands, such as eating, writing or speaking in front of others, as well as any number of social interactions from small talking to carrying on conversation with others. The anxious anticipation, distress and avoidance characteristics of the disorder interfere significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the social anxiety 

00:03:30
Six Steps to a Treatment Plan 

00:03:30
*Identify Primary & Second Problems 

00:03:30
*Describe Behavioral Definitions 

00:03:30
*Diagnosis Based on DSM/ICD Criteria 

00:03:30
*Specify Long-term Goals 

00:03:30
*Create Short-term Objectives 

00:03:30
*Select Treatment Interventions 

00:03:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Now that we've reviewed what constitutes social anxiety, we'll move onto the process of treatment planning and describe its essential steps. There are six primary steps in developing a treatment plan. Each is customized to the individual client's unique presentation. These steps are: identify the client's primary and secondary problems, describe behavioral definitions of the problem, that is each problem's behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal symptom manifestations. Make a diagnosis based on the DSM or the ICD criteria, specify the low-term goals for the treatment process, create short-term objectives for the client and select treatment interventions. 

00:04:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA A client might talk about a variety of issues during the assessment but at as a first step in creating a treatment plan, the clinician must determine the most significant problem or problems. This is often done by assessing which problems are most related to current distress disability or both. Usually a primary problem will surface and secondary problems may also be evident. So some other issues may have to be set aside as not urgent enough to require treatment at this time. An effective treatment plan can only deal with a few identified problems or treatment will lose its direction. 

00:04:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Clients may express the same general problem in different ways. The manner in which they think, feel, behave or interact will be to some degree unique to them and their situation. So each problem that is selected for treatment requires a specific definition of how it's evidenced in your client. So as a second step in the treatment planning process, the behavioral definition of the problem is specified. These features may very well correspond to diagnostic criteria like those found in the DSM or the ICD. 

00:05:25
DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS FOURTH EDITION TEXT REVISION DSM-IV-TR AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION 

00:05:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE You should keep these in mind as behavioral definitions are formulated. 

00:05:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA The third step in treatment planning, the determination of an appropriate diagnosis, is based on an evaluation of the client's complete clinical presentation. The clinician must note the behavioral, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal features causing distress or disability. And then compare them to the criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder as described in the DSM or ICD. Note that not all therapists use psychiatric diagnosis per se in formulating their treatment plans, but instead prefer to focus on changes in the identified problem behavior, cognition, emotions and the like. Having said that, most third party payers require a diagnosis and most ESTs are based on research that uses diagnostic criteria to define problems. So it's usually necessary to make a diagnosis. 

00:06:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Step four in developing a treatment plan is to set long-term goals for the resolution of the client's primary and secondary problems. These goal statements need not be crafted in measurable terms but can be broader and indicate a desired general positive outcome to the treatment process. One or more goal statements can be developed. 

00:06:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Writing short-term objectives for the client to achieve is step five. In contrast to long-term goals, objectives should be stated in behaviorally measurable or observable terms. Clearly stated objectives are helpful to both the therapist and the client in assessing process. They're also important to quality assurance review agencies, health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations in assessing whether and when the client is making progress. The objectives should be designed with this requirement for accountability in mind. 

00:07:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Now interventions are the actions of the clinician within the therapeutic alliance, designed to help the client accomplish the treatment objectives. Selecting the appropriate therapist interventions is the sixth and final step in treatment planning. There should be at least one intervention plan for every client objective. If the client doesn't accomplish the objective after the initial intervention's been implemented, a new intervention should be considered in the plan. 

00:07:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA From what we've just described, it may sound like this is a pretty cut and dry process and that you simply just repeat the process with every client. But that's really not the case. One important aspect of effective treatment planning is that each plan should be tailored to the individual client's unique problems, strengths and needs. Treatment plans should never be boilerplate, even if clients have similar problems. 

00:08:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Good point, Art. The individual's strengths and weakness, unique stressors, cultural and social network, family circumstances and symptom patterns must be considered in developing any treatment strategy. Clinicians should rely on their own good judgment and select interventions that are appropriate for the distinctive individual with whom they're working. 

00:08:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Now that we've discussed the steps involved in treatment planning, let's move on to showing how this treatment planning process can be informed by psychotherapy outcome research. 

00:08:50
Brief History of the Movement to Identify ESTs 

00:08:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA We begin by providing a brief overview of the movement to identify empirically supported psychological treatments. 

00:09:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Although it can argued that the movement to empirically informed psychologic treatment began hundreds of years ago when the scientific method was first applied to the study of psychology, the specific task of identifying empirically supported psychological treatments began in earnest in the early 1990's, both in Great Britain and the United States. On the forefront of the movement here was Division 12 of the American Psychological Association, the Society of Clinical Psychology. 

00:09:25
Society of Clinical Psychology American Psychological Association, Division 12 Task Force on Psychological Interventions Refers to: the original Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures and the subsequent Task Force on Psychological Interventions 

00:09:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE In 1993, Division 12 organized the Task Force on Psychological Interventions chaired by Dr. Dianne Chambless. It was charged with reviewing the psychotherapy outcome literature to identify psychological treatments who's efficacy had been demonstrated through clinical research. 

00:09:40
Criteria for Treatment 

00:09:40
*Well-Established Treatments *Probably Efficacious Treatments 

00:09:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE The group established criteria for judging the quantity and quality of the research supporting a particular treatment and categorized treatments meeting these criteria as either well-established or probably efficacious. More detail on the criteria used for these categories can be found in the workbook. 

00:10:00
Products of EST Reviews 

00:10:00
*By 1996, 47 ESTs 

00:10:00
*By 1998, 71 ESTs 

00:10:00
*By 1999, Division 12 took ownership of list 

00:10:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE By 1996, the group had identified a preliminary list of 47 ESTs. By 1998, the list had grown to 71. In 1999, Division 12 took full ownership of maintaining this growing list.

00:10:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Since the work on this original group, other reviewers have emerged using the same or similar criteria to review literature related to other populations, problems and interventions. These are some examples. And as we mentioned, Great Britain was on the forefront of these efforts. The latest products of their work can be found at the website for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Finally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, or SAMHSA for short, has recently begun an initiative to evaluate, identify and provide information on the evidence-based mental health practices. They have entitled their initiative as the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices. Their work can also be found online.

00:11:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA In this series, we draw from these literatures to show how clinicians can integrate goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent ESTs identified by these groups. 

00:11:25
Introduction to ESTs for Social Anxiety Disorder 

00:11:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Empirically informing the treatment planning process involves integrating those aspects of identified ESTs into each step of the treatment planning process. For social anxiety disorder, several of the EST review groups, including the original APA Division 12 group, Nathan and Gorman and Kendall and Chambless have identified cognitive and behavioral treatments as therapies meeting the criteria for an EST. 

00:11:45
ESTs for Social Anxiety *Cognitive Restructuring *Exposure *Social Skills Training *Anxiety Management Skills Training *Psychoeducation 

00:11:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Cognitive and behavioral therapies for social anxiety and public speaking fears, refer to a variety of techniques, including cognitive restructuring, exposure and skills training. In addition, skills used for managing anxiety may be trained. There is also a strong ongoing emphasis on psychoeducation. Let's start by looking at cognitive restructuring. 

00:12:10
Cognitive Perspective 

00:12:10
*Maintained by negative, biased beliefs 

00:12:10
*Common themes: *Doing something embarrassing *Getting a negative evaluation *Performing inadequately 

00:12:10
Cognitive Restructuring Helps clients identify, challenged, and ultimately change these negative, biased ways of thinking about social situations 

00:12:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE From the cognitive perspective, the excessive fear in social performance situations characteristic of SAD is maintained by negative, biased beliefs that overestimate the likelihood and catastrophize the consequences of doing something embarrassing, getting a negative evaluation from others or performing inadequately in some way. Cognitive restructuring helps the client to identify, challenge and ultimately change these negative, biased ways of thinking about social situations. It brings thinking more in line with the actual low probability that bad things will occur while decatastrophizing of fear consequences should they actually occur. 

00:12:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA So in short, the cognitive therapist seeks to help the client identify his or her distorted thinking patterns . . . 

00:13:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. 

00:13:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Then assists them in challenging these thoughts and exchanging them with more reality-based thoughts. 

00:13:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. 

00:13:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA And what about the behavioral therapies? 

00:13:10
Behavioral Perspective Avoidance maintains social anxiety by not allowing anxiety associated with social performance or social interaction to extinguish 

00:13:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well from that perspective, significance is given to the role of avoidance. Uhm, from these models avoidance maintains social anxiety by not allowing anxiety associated with either social performance or social interaction to ultimately extinguish. 

00:13:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. And the kind of avoidance we're talking about here can be subtle or obvious, correct? 

00:13:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, correct. 

00:13:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Something as subtle as not participating fully in social interactions . . . 

00:13:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . to something as obvious as just not showing up. 

00:13:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, just not showing up, exactly. Any of these forms of avoidance are seen as products of fear basically. So the treatment aims to help the client change from this kind fearful avoidance of social situations . . . 

00:13:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:13:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . to a nonavoidant approach. 

00:13:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE You know, from the behavioral perspective, avoidance doesn't allow new learning, ah, that would change fear to occur. 

00:13:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA And this new learning is accomplished through exposure techniques? 

00:14:00
Behavioral Exposure Gradually and repeatedly enter feared social situations, staying in them, interacting, and allowing conditioned anxiety to gradually extinguish over time 

00:14:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exposure is, ah, a behavioral treatment technique that has clients to gradually and repeatedly enter feared social situations, staying in them for a while, interacting, and allowing . . . 

00:14:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:14:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . this kind of conditioned anxiety to gradually extinguish over time. 

00:14:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA With exposure therapy, the therapist helps the client identify an array of social situations . . . 

00:14:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:14:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . that increasingly produce anxiety . . . 

00:14:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:14:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . and then assigns him or her to take small and increasingly . . . 

00:14:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:14:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . greater steps towards entering and staying in these anxiety producing situations? 

00:14:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yes, exact--exactly. And clients take these tasks at their own pace essentially with some gentle urging and support by the therapist or group members if it's done in group. 

00:14:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:14:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE It's, it's done step by step. 

00:14:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:14:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Some clients do it very gradually, others may be more aggressive and assertive. 

00:14:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Like behavioral interventions for other problems, skilled training may be used in addition to exposure? 

00:14:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Behavioral treatments for social anxiety may include skills training. Some therapists may also teach skills for managing anxiety during exposures. 

00:15:00
Social Skills 

00:15:00
*Conversational Skills *Assertiveness *Other Communication Skills *Formal Public Speaking 

00:15:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA The types of social skills that may be the focus of training, those include conversational skills . . . 

00:15:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:15:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . assertiveness . . . 

00:15:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Assertiveness. Yeah. 

00:15:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Ah, other communication skills? 

00:15:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. Uhm, social skills, even formal public speaking skills if that's, ah, relevant. 

00:15:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:15:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE You know, the decision to train skills is based on an assessment of the client's needs, their skill level and like. So some clients with social anxiety actually have good social skills. 

00:15:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Sure. 

00:15:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE But their anxieties interfere with their abilities to use them. 

00:15:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:15:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE So others may, ah, have skill deficits . . . 

00:15:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:15:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . ah, that make, you know, rewarding social interaction difficult. So part of the treatment planning for social anxiety requires an assessment of this relationship and whether anxiety management, social skills training or both are, are needed. 

00:15:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA So a strong anxiety is a part of the picture and interfering with the client's ability to function. You mentioned that anxiety management skills may be trained. Let's talk about those anxiety management skills. 

00:16:00
Anxiety Management Skills 

00:16:00
*Applied Relaxation *Thought-stopping *Attentional Refocusing 

00:16:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Sure, common skills include things like applied relaxation, ah, to, to just physically calm thought-stopping to stop an anxious train of thought. 

00:16:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Sure. 

00:16:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Attentional refocusing bask--back on the task that is. 

00:16:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:16:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Ah, the goal is to help the client stay focused on the social task to try to maintain this external focus on the task as opposed to getting caught up in this kind of self-conscious, internal focus that, ah, drives anxiety. 

00:16:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. In fact, these skills are trained like most skills . . . 

00:16:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:16:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . using some instructional . . . 

00:16:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Instruction. 

00:16:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . skill. Maybe some modeling? 

00:16:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Modeling . . . 

00:16:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:16:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . rehearsal. 

00:16:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Rehearsal by the client. 

00:16:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. Yeah. In most of these treatments, the skills training, the exposures, the cognitive restructuring or any therapeutic task is usually done first in the session, either individual or group therapy. When the skill's mastered relatively well, then it's typically carried out into everyday life through homework exercises. 

00:16:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Exposure derives from early behavioral therapies like . . . 

00:16:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:16:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . systematic desensitization. 

00:16:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:16:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA I'm old enough to remember that. But it can be used in conjunction with cognitive . . . 

00:17:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:17:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . restructuring as well, correct? 

00:17:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, it certainly can. Uhm, you know, from the cognitive perspective, exposure serves as an arena for what, ah, they call behavioral experiment, which is an exercise in, in where the clients, ah, fearful thoughts, alternative predictions . . . 

00:17:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:17:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . alternatives are generated . . . 

00:17:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:17:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . and then both are tested in this kind of real life . . . 

00:17:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Behavioral experiment again. 

00:17:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Behavior experiment . . . 

00:17:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:17:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE But it sure looks like exposure. 

00:17:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA In addition to cognitive restructuring, exposure and the skills training . . . 

00:17:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:17:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . there's a strong emphasis on initial and ongoing psychoeducation in all of these therapies. Isn't that right? 

00:17:35
Psycoeducation 

00:17:35
*Information about social anxiety *Development and maintenance *Rationale for treatment *Others that help clients achieve their therapeutic goals 

00:17:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. That's true. You know, common themes of psychoeducation including, ah, information like about social anxiety, how the therapy might conceptualize it's development, it's maintenance and that's the basis for providing the rationale for the treatment. It may talk about the various components. But it can include anything the therapist thinks will help the client achieve his or her therapeutic goals. 

00:17:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. And all of this must be done within a collaborative relationship. 

00:18:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Building a strong therapeutic alliance . . . 

00:18:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . which is particularly important in these therapies where clients are asked to challenge their fears. 

00:18:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Absolutely. 

00:18:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA What about the question of just doing one aspect of these treatments like just doing exposure for example or cognitive restructuring or . . . 

00:18:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . how about relaxation training. 

00:18:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:18:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA The literature suggests that some of these individual interventions can be used on their own, but is that what therapists typically do? 

00:18:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. That's a very good point. It's true. There is evidence, for example, that exposure without formal cognitive restructuring can be as effective as a combination. Skills training, ah, has shown efficacy by itself. 

00:18:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:18:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Having said that, most therapists using, ah, the EST approach to social anxiety will draw on various applications. 

00:18:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Combine them. 

00:18:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Combine them, both cognitive and behavioral therapies, to accomplish any of multiple goals. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. Hmm. How about relaxation training? 

00:18:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well applied relaxation by itself has, ah, shown efficacy with phobic disorders and some will use this application but typically as an adjunct in a larger multimodal therapy. 

00:19:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. Again, a combination. 

00:19:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. And some therapists don't train calming or coping skills at all in favor of the kind of more cognitive attentional approach, ah, ah, where they might, you know, train thought-stopping or attentional refocusing. Ah, and some just use exposure and they don't train any coping skills at all. 

00:19:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE They just want you to focus on the exposure task over and over again. 

00:19:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Is the same true for social skills training? 

00:19:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Any skills training is typically used as an optional component, ah, of the CBT for individual who would seem to benefit from that particular, ah, improved skill. 

00:19:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA So what modality is used in providing these? 

00:19:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well in clinical trials, they've been typically delivered in small group format which, ah, has some very strong practical advantages over one-to-one therapy . . . 

00:19:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure 

00:19:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . and that you've got built-in resources . . . 

00:19:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:19:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . for doing exposure skills training and the like in addition to other benefits of, of group therapy. 

00:20:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. Benefits like group member support. 

00:20:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. 

00:20:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA And feedback . . . 

00:20:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:20:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . from the group members to the client. 

00:20:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. Now having said that, they can also be done effectively individually if, if you can find the, the practical, you can call it the practical side of it. 

00:20:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Okay. Okay. So there's a range. What is the usual length of treatment? 

00:20:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well typically these treatments, ah, run 12 to 16 sessions. They're typically conducted, ah, weekly. There's some evidence of briefer versions, like four to eight sessions, can be effective as well. And, of course, if, ah, there's more complexity . . . 

00:20:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:20:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . slower response, fewer opportunities to do exposures, things like that that can lengthen it even . . . 

00:20:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Can go longer. 

00:20:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE It can, it can lengthen treatment. Yeah. 

00:20:35
Integrating ESTs for Social Anxiety Disorder into Treatment Planning 

00:20:35
Behavioral Definitions 

00:20:35
*Expresses excessive, unrealistic fear about social performance 

00:20:35
*Admits to constant worry about social interaction 

00:20:35
*Feels blamed by others for the slightest imperfection or mistake 

00:20:35
*Reports symptoms of automatic hyperactivity in social situations 

00:20:35
*Demonstrates symptoms of motor muscle tension 

00:20:35
*Reports symptoms of hypervigilance in social settings 

00:20:35

*Lacks the necessary social skills to initiate and maintain relationships 

00:20:35
*Alienates self from others due to socially inappropriate behavior 

00:20:35
*Others 

00:20:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA With all this background in mind, let's look at how cognitive and behavioral treatments for social anxiety can be integrated into the essential steps involved in treatment planning. The first step in treatment planning is to identify your client's manifestations of social anxiety and select or create these to form a behavioral definition. For example, your client may express excessive, unrealistic fear or worry about social performance or interactions. They may show anticipatory anxiety or worry about social situations, or evidence social skill deficits. Other clients may show additional different manifestations of social anxiety. Accordingly, the behavioral definition section of your treatment plan is tailored to your individual client's clinical picture. 

00:21:25
Long-term Goals 

00:21:25
*Interact socially without undue fear or anxiety 

00:21:25
*Perform socially without undue fear or debilitating anxiety 

00:21:25
*Develop the essential social skills necessary to function in social situations without undue anxiety 

00:21:25
*Develop the ability to form relationships 

00:21:25
*Reach a personal balance between solitary time and interpersonal interactions with others 

00:21:25
*Form social relationships that enhance the quality of life 

00:21:25
*Others 

00:21:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Next, the clinician and the client set long-term goals. Some examples may include any of these. For example, a goal statement may be interact socially without undue fear or develop the ability to form relationships. Perhaps a development of social skills will be targeted. And there may be others that you develop to fit your clients needs. 

00:21:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Now, let's direct our attention to applying empirically supported treatments to the creation of client objectives and therapist interventions. In the assessment phase, you are seeking a detailed description of the problem and its history from the client. 

00:22:05
Assessment Phase 

00:22:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA An example of an objective that captures this could be describe the history and nature of the fears. 

00:22:10
Short-Term Objectives 1. Describe the history and nature of social fears and avoidance. 

00:22:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Interventions might be to focus on providing a level of trust with the client or assess the client's history of social fears. 

00:22:20
1. Focus on developing a level of trust with the client; provide support and empathy to encourage the client to feel safe in expressing his/her social anxiety. 

00:22:20
2. Assess the client's history of social fears and avoidance to date including the frequency, intensity, and duration of representative symptoms. 

00:22:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA You may also assign a daily journal of social anxiety occurrences or ask the client to complete some objective measures or psychological testing to assess the social anxiety or social skills. To get more detail on this refer to the workbook. 

00:22:40
2. Keep a daily journal of social situations that cause anxious thoughts feelings, and avoidant actions. 

00:22:40
1. Assign the client to keep a daily record of social anxiety, including a description of each situation that caused anxious feelings, the rating of anxiety, using Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs), and thoughts that triggered the anxiety; process the journal material and help the client uncover the dysfunctional, distorted thoughts that fueled the social anxiety. 

00:22:40
3. Complete psychological testing objective questionnaires for assessing social anxiety and social skills. 

00:22:40
1. Administer to the client tests designed to assess social anxiety and social skills (e.g., Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory [SPAI]. The Social Interaction Anxiety Scale [SIAS], the Social Phobia Scale [SPS], The Social Reticence Scale [SRS], Social Skills Inventory [SSI]); score and give feedback to the client; re-administer as needed to assess outcome. 

00:22:40
Psychoeducation 

00:22:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE A common feature of the ESTs for social anxiety disorder is an initial and ongoing psychoeducation. A common emphasis in psychoeducation is helping the client learn about social anxiety, captured in this objective and this intervention. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:00
Short-Term Objectives 4. Verbalize an accurate understanding of the vicious cycle of social anxiety and avoidance. 

00:23:00
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Discuss how social anxiety derives from cognitive biases that overestimate the likelihood and manageability of negative evaluation by others, undervalue one's self-efficacy, distress and often lead to unnecessary avoidance that maintains the fear. 

00:23:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Another emphasis is to convey information about the treatment and its rationale. 

00:23:10
5. Verbalize an understanding of the rationale for treatment of social anxiety. 

00:23:10
1. Discuss how cognitive restructuring and exposure serve as an arena to desensitize learned fear, build social skills and confidence, and reality-test biased thoughts. 

00:23:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Often books or other reading materials are recommended to the client to supplement psychoeducation done in session. 

00:23:15
2. Assign the client to read about cognitive restructuring and exposure-based therapy in chapters of books or treatment manuals on social anxiety (e.g., Managing Social Anxiety by Hope, Heimberg, Juster,and Turk; Dying of Embarrassment by Markaway, Carmin, Pollard, and Flynn) 

00:23:15
Calming & Coping Skills 

00:23:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA As we mentioned, ESTs for social anxiety will sometimes including anxiety management skills training. An example of a short-term objective consistent with this is implement calming and coping strategies. 

00:23:30
Short-Term Objectives 6. Learn and implement calming and coping strategies to reduce overall anxiety and manage anxiety when heightened. 

00:23:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA A treatment intervention consistent with it might be teach the client relaxation, thought-stopping and attentional refocusing. 

00:23:35
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Teach the client relaxation, thought stopping, and attentional focusing skills (e.g., staying focused externally and on behavioral goals, muscular relaxation, evenly paced diaphragmatic breathing, ride the wave of anxiety.) 

00:23:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Again, books or other reading materials may be recommended to supplement work done in session. 

00:23:45
2. Assign the client to read about calming and coping strategies in books or treatment manuals on social anxiety. 

00:23:45
Calming & Coping Skills 

00:23:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE We also mentioned that some ESTs for social anxiety train calming or coping skills while some do not. Applied relaxation is a stand-alone treatment with some empirical support for phobic disorders that is used by some therapists in conjunction with other cognitive and behavioral techniques. In applied relaxation, clients are taught how to repeatedly and quickly induce relaxation in the presence of social cues until anxiety in these situations reduces. The procedure starts by teaching the client how to achieve relaxation through progressive muscle relaxation or PMR. 

00:24:20
Progressive Muscle Relaxation Systematically tensing and releasing muscle groups until full-body relaxation is achieved 

00:24:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE PMR is an exercise in which a client is taught how to systematically relax muscle groups by tensing and releasing until there is complete body relaxation. As the client becomes more skilled, the exercise is then typically condensed so that relaxation can be achieved very quickly, something termed rapid relaxation. 

00:24:40
Rapid Relaxation Learn to induce relaxation in the presence of social cues until anxiety associated with them is decreased 

00:24:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Once rapid relaxation's mastered, the client induces relaxation in the presence of social cues until the anxiety associated with them is decreased. 

00:24:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA When coping skills for managing social anxiety are trained, a common approach includes some combination of rapid relaxation, thought-stopping and attentional refocusing. This vignette shows how a therapist might work with a client to introduce these coping skills. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Okay, in some of your previous sessions and in your homework, you practiced the muscle relaxation to calm yourself down. So how's that going? 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN It's going pretty well but I still have a lot of anxiety. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Well, the relaxation is just one part of managing your anxiety. It's focused on the physical side and it's used to help maintain some level of calm. We want to keep doing that but as discussed, a primary source of anxiety has to do with what your mind is focused on. For example, let's say you are relaxed and thinking about something calm like lying on the beach. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN Pretty nice, okay. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN Then while you're relaxed, you suddenly start thinking about something bad happening to you like you walk into a room full of people and they all start laughing and you assume that they're laughing about you. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Right. I see, yeah, not so relaxed anymore. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Exactly. And in social situations, your goal is to get your focus off things that will make you anxious like your heart is doing or what that guy who's laughing is thinking about and you want to keep your mind on what you're going to do in that social situation. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Does that make sense? 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Perfect sense. Yeah. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN So let's talk about what you can do if your mind starts to wander off. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Okay, sounds good. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN The first thing I'd like you to try is a simple technique called thought-stopping. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Thought-stopping? What's that? 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN It, it helps you to take control and stop the focus on negative things like the thought I'm going to make a fool of myself or people will laugh at me. You can usually tell when you are focused on negative thoughts by paying attention to how you feel. So whenever you start to have an anxious thought, I want you to shout the word "stop" in your head without saying--making a sound. Sometimes it helps to even picture a big red stop sign in your head. Does that make sense? 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN I think so. Shout "stop" to myself the minute I start to have an anxious thought. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN That's right. And then the next step is to immediately bring yourself back to what you're supposed to be doing and thinking about at that moment. So you redirect your focus away from thoughts that make you feel anxious and focus on what is going on around you. You ask yourself what am I supposed to be doing right now. Focus on the here and now. You want to stop thinking about what's making you anxious or your heart rate or your sweaty palms and instead think about what you want to say or do at the moment. Does that make sense? 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN It does. Uh-huh. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN So let me show you how it works. Let's say I have to walk into a room full of people. Some of them I know, some I don't know. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN And before I go in, I want to calm myself down using the rapid relaxation skill, like this . . . 

00:28:05
[sil.] 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN Then a thought enters my mind that tells me I won't know what to say after I say hello. Immediately I say stop in my mind and picture a big red stop sign in my head. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Then I refocus my attention and take my mind off the negative though and think about what I would like to do in this situation. I think about why I'm here and who do I know that I can talk to. I think about Jack who is standing over there and how can I ask him about his son's basketball game last night. So you see how this works? 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN I used relaxation, thought-stopping and the refocusing skill all together. Okay, now you try it. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:29:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah, this therapist is, ah, moving from the somatic here into the more cognitive coping skills, huh? 

00:29:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. They've, ah, sounds like they've done progressive muscle relaxation and, ah, now they're going to focus, ah, on some of the--basically attentional, ah, coping skills. 

00:29:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. It's important to get that client focusing on the task at hand versus those internal states or messages that they give to themselves. 

00:29:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. The notion is that, you know, if you're, if you're, uhm, in a social situation and, and you start focusing on what your body's doing or what people are thinking of you and so this is just generating anxiety. 

00:29:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:29:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE It's, it's taking you off task. It can actually interfere with, ah . . . 

00:29:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:29:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . with the performance. So, you know, that's usually discussed in session and, and the alternative to that is that, you know, this isn't likely to happen so let's just try to stop doing this. 

00:29:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:29:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE So if you find yourself--let's just stop and let's get back on the task. 

00:29:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:29:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE That also sets it up as a bit of an exposure. Bit of a, a, a behavioral experiment. You know, they're testing the prediction. 

00:30:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA The prediction. Yeah. 

00:30:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:30:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA And I think the fact that she paired them so nicely was good. The relaxation with the attentional refocusing, with the thought-stopping. All three of those coping skills were paired together to help. 

00:30:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. Some, ah, some folks will teach--will, will integrate the somatic with the cognitive. Some will just do the cognitive and then in a--like in applied relaxation, it's just rapid relaxation . . . 

00:30:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:30:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . in a social setting. 

00:30:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:30:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE So. 

00:30:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA And some won't do this at all. 

00:30:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Some don't do it at all. I mean, you know, some folks will just set up exposure and, ah, and the notion is--there's still saying stay on the task, you know, stick to your exposure goals. But they don't necessarily, ah, explicitly train coping skills per se. 

00:30:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Yeah. There's some controversy over that. 

00:30:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE There some disagreement. 

00:30:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA We alluded to that in our, ah, lecture stuff earlier. 

00:30:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. 

00:30:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. Let's move on now to cognitive restructuring. 

00:30:55
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:30:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Cognitive Restructuring is a common intervention and empirically support cognitive and cognitive behavioral interventions. An example of a treatment plan objective reflecting this intervention could be identify, challenge, and replace biased, fearful self-talk with reality-based, positive self-talk. 

00:31:15
Short-Term Objectives 7. Identify, challenge, and replace biased, fearful self-talk with reality-based, positive self-talk. 

00:31:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE A treatment intervention consistent with cognitive restructuring could be one focused on identifying biased thoughts and generating alternatives that correct for these biases. 

00:31:20
Therapeutic Interventions 

00:31:20
1. Explore the client's schema and self-talk that meditates their social fear response, challenge the biases; assist him/her in generating appraisals that correct for the biases and build confidence. 

00:31:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE In cognitive restructuring assignments are often given to clients that ask them to test their biased thoughts against the reality of daily life. These are referred to as behavioral experiments. This is a treatment intervention consistent with this practice. 

00:31:40
2. Assign the client to read about cognitive restructuring in books or treatment manuals on social anxiety. 

00:31:40
3. Assign the client a homework exercise in which he/she identifies fearful self-talk and creates reality-based alternatives; test them in a chosen situation; review and reinforce success, providing corrective feedback toward the goal of improvement. 

00:31:40
Cognitive Restructuring 

00:31:40
*Educate about how cognitive appraisals influence emotional reactions 

00:31:40
*Identify relevant self-talk 

00:31:40
*Identify biases and generate alternatives that correct for the biases 

00:31:40
*Convert the biased and alternative thoughts into predictions that can be tested through behavioral experiments 

00:31:40
*Conduct behavior experiments/exposures 

00:31:40
*Review toward the goal of testing fearful predictions against healthy alternatives 

00:31:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA One of the first steps in cognitive restructuring is to teach the client how self-talk influences emotional reactions to events, as opposed to seeing emotional reactions as something independent of thought processes. Once that link is established, the next step is to begin identifying the client's self-talk that is influencing their emotional reactions. As cognitive restructuring progresses, the biases and the client's self-talk are identified, alternatives to them are generated and then the validity of these are typically tested through repeated behavioral experiments like we talked about earlier. 

00:32:15
Cognitive Restructuring Goal is to change appraisals of threat from biased predictions to alternatives that are more in line with likely outcomes 

00:32:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA The goal of cognitive restructuring is to change appraisals of threat from biased predictions to alternatives that are more in line with likely outcomes. 

00:32:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE In this vignette, the therapist works with a client to understand the link between thinking and emotion and then does some initial assessment of the client's self-talk that may be influencing his socially anxious, emotional reactions. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN In previous sessions, we talked how your self-talk triggers your emotions. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN We also identified some of the self-talk that contributes to your anxiety before and during social situations. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Do you recall of those? 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yes and now that I'm aware of it, I see that I do it a lot. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Okay, that's not surprising. So what have you noticed that you're saying to yourself? 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN I say I'm not going to be able to do this. I'm going to get too nervous. Everybody's going to notice. They're going to think something's wrong with me. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Okay. And does it make sense to you that when you see the situation that way, it looks very scary and you don't feel confident at all. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Yes, I feel I'm not going to be able to handle it and everybody will notice. 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN And the self-talk makes you feel . . .? 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN It makes me feel bad and nervous and pretty scared usually. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Sure. And now we also said that if we turn the self-talk into a prediction of what will happen that it doesn't always line up with what actually happens. Your prediction usually overestimates these bad things and underestimates your ability to manage the situation. Do you remember that? 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. I can see these things don't happen like I thought they would. I just can't stop myself from thinking this way when I'm there. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Well that's normal. That's the way it usually works unfortunately. And that's why just understanding it isn't enough. We want to challenge the self-talk directly. We want to prove it's telling the truth. And if not, then to start dismissing it. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. I just hope I can do it. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN You're willing to try then? 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'll give it a try. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Now we've said that the self-talk is overestimating the bad things, then there must be an alternative prediction that doesn't. One that's closer to what is likely to happen. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Do you remember generating those alternative predictions? 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Basically, we said that I might get nervous but if I stay focus on what I want to do, I can probably do it. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Right. If losing control and not being able to do it is an overestimation, then a more realistic prediction is that you might have some anxiety but you won't lose control. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN And if the self-talk underestimates your abilities to handle what you want to do, then an alternative prediction would be that you will manage the situation even if you have to do it while you're nervous. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Which I know is probably the case. It's just hard to believe when I'm in this situation. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN Right. And the idea here is that it's more likely to become believable as you continue to des--test these predictions directly . . . 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN . . . and see in your experience that you can believe the alternatives. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. I can see that. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Okay. So let's find a situation where we can do this. We'll identify the predictions that you might have in a fearful situation and the alternatives that are more realistic. Then we can plan out the situation, figure out what you want to do and then go for it. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN In the next session, we'll go over how it turned out and build from there. Does that sound okay? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Sounds great. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN So what are some situations coming up this week where you might be able to practice? 

00:35:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA That was a good demonstration of the basic steps of cognitive restructuring, don't you think? 

00:36:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. I think, you know, uhm, she's helping this client, ah, understand the connection between thoughts and emotion and then understanding the type of thinking that he's been engaged in whi--while he's socially anxious. 

00:36:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:36:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE She even kind of moved it--in fact, I think it was a good demonstration but it was probably moving much faster than . . . 

00:36:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA It always is, yeah. 

00:36:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:36:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA You know, in these demos . . . 

00:36:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. Right. So, ah, they got into the alternatives and then, of course, they're going to go to doing, you know, setting up predictions and, and doing, ah, testing of that through exposure. 

00:36:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA I think that education part is always a part of this cognitive restructuring is that you need to give them things to read, you need to be able to discush it--discuss it in sections, ah, in the session itself. But it always is important to lead the patient through this whole procedure of understanding this. 

00:36:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE It is. And I think, you know, one of the things that was demonstrated here was that the client was, uhm, you know, expressing an understanding of some of these things . . . 

00:36:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:36:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . but also saying . . . 

00:36:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:36:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . I'm not sure I'm going to feel this way . . . 

00:37:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:37:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . when I get out there. 

00:37:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. Right. Yeah. I understand it but I can't seem to keep myself from feeling it. 

00:37:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:37:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:37:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Which, which also speaks to the point that understanding may not be, you know, sufficient. 

00:37:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. Sure. They've got to experience it and that's where those experiments come in hand and giving them homework to really test out their . . . 

00:37:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:37:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . positive alternative thoughts. 

00:37:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. It's kind of like the, the rational mind says yeah, I understand that but they really got to see in their experience that this is going to be okay and people don't do this, you know, judge me harshly. . . 

00:37:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . and those kinds of, ah, things. So one of the ways that can really be facilitated that's not shown here is that, ah, this type of treatment's conducted typically in groups. 

00:37:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Oh yeah. Sure. 

00:37:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE And so people are, you know, the group's an exposure in itself. 

00:37:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:37:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE Right. And--but then they can, they can talk about these thoughts within the group and identify them. Sometimes it's done as, as a set of exercises and, and things like that. 

00:37:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Just for the client to be in a group situation and be able to speak in a group situation is an exposure for them. 

00:38:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE It is and group is very practical because you've got built-in exposures with your fellow, ah, group members. 

00:38:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. 

00:38:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE They're the audience. 

00:38:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. Now we take a look at the EST technique of exposure. Exposure to situations where the client fears social performance or interaction is a principal of empirically supported treatments for social anxiety. This begins with the construction of a hierarchy of feared activities that will guide the client through exposure exercises ranging from lesser feared to greater feared situations. These exposures are typically practiced in session using role play of staged situations until mastered sufficiently. They are then moved to real world activities, something known as exposure in vivo. 

00:38:50
Situational Exposure 

00:38:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE An objective that captures in session exposure could be participate in gradual repeated exposure to feared social situations. 

00:38:55
Short-Term Objectives 8. Participate in gradual repeated exposure to feared social situations within individual or group therapy sessions; review with therapist. 

00:39:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Therapeutic interventions consistent with this objective would include those related to constructing a fear hierarchy in conducting the exposures. 

00:39:05
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Direct and assist the client in the construction of a hierarchy of feared situations associated with the social anxiety. 

00:39:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE There's always reading assignments to supplement therapeutic interventions may be used. 

00:39:10
3. Assign the client to read about exposure in books or treatment manuals on society anxiety. 

00:39:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Between session exposures could be captured in an objective such as this. 

00:39:15
9. Undergo gradual repeated exposure to feared social situations outside of individual or group therapy sessions. 

00:39:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE And with a treatment intervention such as this. 

00:39:20
1. Assign the client homework exercises in which he/she does exposure exercises and records responses; review and reinforce success, providing corrective feedback toward improvement. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:25
Role-played (Staged) Exposure 

00:39:25
*Select interaction from fear hierarchy for exposures 

00:39:25
*Lay out step-by-step goals 

00:39:25
*Rehearse exposure with clients picturing themselves accomplishing the risk and managing foreseeable challenges 

00:39:25
*Model the exposure, if helpful 

00:39:25
*Ask the client to do the exposure, periodically taking ongoing SUDs ratings 

00:39:25
*Review afterward providing feedback for improving mastery 

00:39:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Role played or staged exposures are commonly used in empirically supported treatments for social anxiety. Procedurally, a real life social performance or social interaction situation is first selected. The goals and each person's roles and responsibilities are laid out. The exposure plan may be reviewed, rehearsed and modeled before conducting it. During the exposure, a measure of the client's anxiety is taken periodically, like every 30 to 60 seconds they are asked to provide a SUDs rating of anxiety. Ideally, the exposure continues until those ratings have lowered and stabilized. Something called within session extinction. They are repeated from one session to another until the client can conduct them without debilitating anxiety. This is often referred to as between session extinction. 

00:40:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE In this vignette, the therapist works with a client to rehearse a planned exposure. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Well, would you agree that your exposure turned out well? 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I would say it went very well. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN So what are you finding is most helpful? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Well laying them out, rehearsing them, that helps. Staying focused, not getting distracted by my heart rate. But I haven't been too anxious either. Of course, I've been doing situations that are only twos and threes. 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Well I think you may find that the things that have worked for twos and threes will also be helpful and effective as you tackle the higher levels. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN I think you've done very well. Do you feel like taking the next step? 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN Well I have that presentation to the board in a few weeks. So yeah. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN Right. And what did you rate that? 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN I rated that a five. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN So would you like to try? 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think I need to. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Okay. So let's start with what you want to do in this presentation to the board. We'll lay out a plan. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN If you can write out what you want to say between this session and our next one and practice it, we can get it down the way you want it. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Sounds good. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN So let's lay out what this presentation involves and let's discuss how you would like it to go. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Well it's a sales summary presentation. It takes about five minutes. What I do is present the sales statistics for the last quarter. 

00:41:50
Next Session 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Okay. So you have the presentation? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Yes, I do. I have it right here as a matter of fact. I have practiced it at home. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN That's great. So like we've done before, I'm the audience and just act as if you're at the meeting. I'll be asking for your SUD rating periodically. But just give it to me quickly and get right back on track. Remember how we've done that? 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, I remember that. Uh-huh. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN So one of our goals is that no matter what happens, your heart races or you notice someone yawning or whatever it is, that you stay as focused as possible on what you're there to do. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN You want to act you belong there. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Remember, you're the one who knows this information and your role is to convey it to the board so they can use it. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Okay. I think I'm ready. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN One last thing. What's your rating right now? 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN Right now it's about a six. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Are you ready to start? 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Okay. All right. Well good morning. I'm Bob from accounting. I'm here to present the sales summaries for the quarter end September 21st. 

00:42:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA You know, this client obviously has done some exposure before. She begins right away with reviewing that experience. 

00:43:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA And says oh, you did a good job with that and that was good for you. 

00:43:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA But she could have really broken that down. 

00:43:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, ah, it's a very important part of exposure, ah, to review it, identify what went well, what the strengths were. You often have to problem solve obstacles. 

00:43:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Get at the self-talk underneath it. What were you saying to yourself. 

00:43:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE It's an arena for all those things. 

00:43:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:43:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE So, yeah, that would have definitely been more elaborated in, in actual, you know . . . 

00:43:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA More detail there . . . 

00:43:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:43:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . would have helped a little bit. 

00:43:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. No question. I did think she used homework well. 

00:43:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:43:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE You know, she, she asked the--she set up an exposure and she asked the client to do the presentation, prepare it and that kind of thing. 

00:43:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:43:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Uhm, you know, he can do some, ah, imaginal or, or rehearsal of it at home and then, and then come in and, and try it. 

00:43:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:43:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE That's, that was a good example of the kind of homework you would, you would see in this. 

00:43:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Good. 

00:43:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE In this therapy. 

00:43:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Good. And I thought there was a lot of rehearsal in this particular vignette. Not a lot of exposure yet. 

00:44:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:44:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA And, you know, we could of--she could of strengthened that a little bit maybe future sessions. 

00:44:05
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:44:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA Have the client get up, do the presentation, have her act as a--and then respond a little bit. 

00:44:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE Oh yeah. 

00:44:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA So there could have been more . . . 

00:44:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. Well there probably is in . . . 

00:44:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . in terms of exposure there. 

00:44:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:44:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Now he's obviously going to get exposure when he goes off and does--and performs this . . . 

00:44:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:44:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . particular task . . . 

00:44:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:44:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . of reporting to the board. 

00:44:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. I agree. I actually think this demonstration is a good demonstration of the rehearsal of, of an exposure. 

00:44:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:44:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE So, uhm, you know, he was sitting instead of standing and so on and so forth, which, you know, if somebody's anxious about getting up and doing it, ah, that you might start there. 

00:44:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA It's good preparation. 

00:44:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Good preparation. 

00:44:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:44:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE And then you would want to do it . . . 

00:44:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:44:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . where it was more like the situation . . . 

00:44:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA More reality elements. 

00:44:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah, exactly. 

00:44:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. 

00:44:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE One of the things I wanted to comment on about this is this use of this SUD rating. 

00:44:45
ARTHUR JONGSMA Oh yeah. 

00:44:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE It stands for Subjective Units of Discomfort, as you know, ah, SUD's rating sometimes. 

00:44:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:44:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE The way that's used in these exposure sessions is you take it as an index of the, ah, client's anxiety. So zero to 10, what's your SUDs? And--well that was demonstrated here at the beginning of this, ah, vignette. But then what you do is, as a, as they're actually performing in the exposure, you periodically ask them for it. You just kind of interrupt . . . 

00:45:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:45:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . and say, what's your rating? 

00:45:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:45:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE And ideally, you want to watch that come down over the course of exposure. And it's also therapeutic to the client to watch it come down. 

00:45:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:45:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Because that's one of the messages . . . 

00:45:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA Reinforces that message of I'm coping better. 

00:45:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Absolutely. 

00:45:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA I'm getting through this. 

00:45:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:45:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:25
Social Skills Training 

00:45:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE And now let's talk about the role of social skills training. ESTs for social anxiety will sometimes add social and other communication skills training to treatment. This applies to cases where improvement in these skills is likely to facilitate a positive outcome. Informing objectives and interventions with social skills training content will deal with an objective like this. 

00:45:45
Short-Term Objectives 10. Learn and implement social skills to reduce anxiety and build confidence in social interactions. 

00:45:45
TIMOTHY BRUCE This objective's associated intervention could be using instruction or modeling to build social skills. 

00:45:50
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Use instruction, modeling, and role-playing to build the client's general social and/or communication skills. 

00:45:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE And again, the use of reading materials to supplement training could be included. 

00:45:55
2. Assign the client to read about general social and/or communication skills in books or treatment manuals on building social skills. 

00:45:55
Social & Other Communication Skills Training 

00:45:55
*Explain rationale for social skills training 

00:45:55
*Identify skills needed to accomplish tasks 

00:45:55
*Model and role-play interactions using skills 

00:45:55
*Repeatedly practice and review toward the goal of developing adequate skills 

00:45:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA When social or any other communication skills are taught, the general format of such intervention involves explaining the rationale for social skills training, identifying specific skills need to accomplish the relevant social tasks like public speaking, modeling and role-playing interactions using the specific skills identified, repeatedly practicing in and outside of sessions and reviewing with the goal of becoming comfortable with these social skills. 

00:46:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Let's see these steps depicted in this vignette. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN So Bob, tell me what it's like for you to meet someone new. Say the husband of a colleague at a business dinner. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Well, I tell you, I'm usually a wreck. I don't know what to say and the more nervous I get, the harder it is to make conversation. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN You know, lots of people don't learn simple social skills because they avoid social situations. So they don't have the opportunity to practice just basic conversation. How about if we do some role-play so you can get comfortable with it? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Okay. I'll give it a try. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN All right. Now in your reading assignment, there were some guidelines to follow. I'd like to review those with you. Okay. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN And the first one is for you to take the initiative to break the ice and greet the other person with just a simple hi, how are you? I'm Bob. You want to always have a follow up question in mind for use after the introduction. Something like how--have you eaten at this restaurant before? Third, be aware of your facial expression and remember, a smile is always a welcoming gesture. Next, you want to maintain eye contact for comfortable periods and be careful not to always look down or away. The fifth one is to watch your body language, stay relaxed and lean toward people when talking or listening to them. Also be mindful of people's names and use their name in conversation to help you remember it and to make personal contact. And finally, show interest in others by asking questions about their lives. I want you to avoid just talking about yourself. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN And I, and I remember reading all those. I just wish I could do all of them. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Well that's why we're here. We're just here to practice it and practice it. And then you can try it at home or with other people as, as you get more familiar with it. So I want you just to try it out on me and just let's pretend that I'm the husband of one of your colleagues. And so you try out the guidelines. Okay? 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Okay, let's give it a try. Okay, so hi. Is it Mike? I'm Bob Baker. It's good to meet you. Have you been here before? 

00:48:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well I think that was a, a, you know, a good demonstration of the kind of basic structure of skills training, in this case conversational skills training. You might, ah, train other skills. 

00:48:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:48:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE You know, public speaking skills. 

00:48:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:48:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Ah, ah, uhm, assertive skills, etcetera. Uhm, I thought she did a good job of, of demonstrating those, the educational component of it. Uhm, it's not uncommon to, ah, to rehearse and practice that kind of skill. 

00:49:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA So she moved from educational component into the rehearsal component, having that person to really be involved in that process. 

00:49:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA She missed one doing the modeling component . . . 

00:49:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE Uh-huh. 

00:49:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . where perhaps it wasn't necessary but that is a step that's often done in . . . 

00:49:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:20
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . is that the therapist can model for the patient . . . 

00:49:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:25
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . how to do these kind of things. 

00:49:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. You typically see modeling especially if there's strong skill deficits . . . 

00:49:30
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:49:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . where the person really needs to see what it is that . . . 

00:49:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. 

00:49:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . they need to do. 

00:49:35
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. 

00:49:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE Uhm, and, ah, so, yeah. She did skip that. It may have been because this patient actually is fairly skilled already. 

00:49:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Right. Yeah. 

00:49:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE So. 

00:49:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA And it also helps if you do this in group I think. You have other people who can participate in the rehearsal. 

00:49:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA And they can react to it. Give the patient some feedback. 

00:49:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA So group therapy is a . . . 

00:49:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. 

00:49:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA . . . powerful technique to use with this. 

00:49:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Well that highlights the practicality of it . . . 

00:50:00
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:50:00
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . for this purpose because a lot of the exposures, the skills training, a lot of these components require other people and situations and so on and, and a lot of them are, are staged and role-played to begin with anyway. 

00:50:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:50:10
TIMOTHY BRUCE You have a built-in bunch of people to do that . . . 

00:50:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:50:15
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . when you do it in group. And group is the most common way these things are done. 

00:50:15
ARTHUR JONGSMA Yeah. And you mentioned earlier that this is a pretty skillful client really, has a lot of facility with social skills. Even you could see that in the interaction with the therapist. 

00:50:25
TIMOTHY BRUCE Yeah. You know, and this is an optional component of these treatments. I mean, essentially an assessment has to be made are we looking at skilled person here whose anxiety is interfering with the use of those skills. If that's the case, we're going to focus on reducing the anxiety . . . 

00:50:40
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:50:40
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . because the skills are going to be allowed to, to, ah, to show themselves. But in some cases, you have an unskilled person or skill deficits and anxiety and that's where you would opt to . . . 

00:50:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Uh-huh. 

00:50:50
TIMOTHY BRUCE . . . not only, ah, work to reduce the anxiety . . . 

00:50:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Then build the skills up. 

00:50:55
TIMOTHY BRUCE Also build the skills up. 

00:50:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Sure. 

00:50:55
Other Common Approaches 

00:50:55
*Psychodynamic interventions exploring Childhood abuse Family situations 

00:50:55
Family/Conjoint Therapy 

00:50:55
Enhancing motivation through "Stage-of-Change" Interventions 

00:50:55
Prescribing or referring medication 

00:50:55
ARTHUR JONGSMA Therapists working with social anxiety have also commonly used other approaches that may be part of an overall treatment plan. Examples include psychodynamic interventions exploring childhood abuse or other traumatic or severely critical family situations. Family or conjoint therapy to reinforce skills and build confidence, enhancing motivation through Stage-of-Change Interventions and prescribing or referring for medication. 

00:51:30
TIMOTHY BRUCE Although there's evidence that empirically supported psychological treatments for social anxiety have lower relapse rates than comparable pharmacological treatments, social anxiety is vulnerable to relapse in some cases. Many of these interventions take common steps to help clients avoid the pitfalls of relapse. Let's take a look at some of them and how they can be incorporated into a treatment plan. 

00:51:50
Common Considerations in Relapse Prevention 

00:51:50
*Explain rationale of prevention interventions 

00:51:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA One of the first steps in relapse prevent is to provide a rationale for it. This typically involves a discussion of the risks for relapse and how using the relapse prevent approaches we will outline can lower that risk. This can be captured in your treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as this. 

00:52:10
Therapeutic Interventions 1. Provide a rationale for relapse prevention that discusses the risk and introduces strategies for preventing it. 

00:52:15
[sil.] 

00:52:20
TIMOTHY BRUCE Another early step in relapse prevent to distinguish between a lapse and a relapse. A lapse is presented as a not uncommon temporary setback that may involve, for example, re-experiencing a socially anxious thought or an urge to avoid, for example, a new social experience. Relapse on the other hand is described as a return to a sustained pattern of fear and avoidance to social situations. This component of relapse prevention can be captured in a therapist intervention such as this one. 

00:52:45
2. Discuss with the client the distinction between a lapse and relapse, associating a lapse with an initial and reversible return of symptoms, fear, or urges to avoid and relapse with the decision to return to fearful and avoidant patterns. 

00:52:50
[sil.] 

00:52:50
*Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 

00:52:50
ARTHUR JONGSMA Accordingly, high risk situations that might make the client vulnerable to a lapse are identified. This discussion may be informed by past difficult experiences or anticipated new ones. 

00:53:10
High-Risk Situations 

00:53:10
*Anxiety or "post-mortem" rumination about possible social miscues 

00:53:10
*Deciding to avoid a social situation 

00:53:10
*Having upcoming social demands that may need to be rehearsed 

00:53:10
ARTHUR JONGSMA Some examples include having a strong anticipatory anxiety, anxiety symptoms or post-mortem rumination about possible social miscues, something which may not have happened for some time, or deciding to avoid a social situation after having not done that for a while, or having upcoming social demands that may need to be rehearsed, such as a wedding. 

00:53:35
*Identify "high-risk" situations for a lapse 

00:53:35
*Review the application of skills learned in therapy to high-risk situations 

00:53:35
TIMOTHY BRUCE For the high-risk situations identified, the therapist and client rehearse coping with each of them using skills learned in therapy. This often includes the skill of developing a tolerance for occasional anxious thoughts and feelings while working to problem solve them. Identifying and rehearsing the management of high-risk situations can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as number three shown here. 

00:54:00
3. Identify and rehearse with the client the management of future situations or circumstances in which lapses could occur. 

00:54:00
*Encourage routine use of skills 

00:54:05
ARTHUR JONGSMA In addition to using the skills learned in therapy to manage high-risk situations, clients are also encouraged to integrate them into their day-to-day lives. This usually includes the goal of engaging in previously avoided situations on a routine basis. Therapist intervention number four captures this in the treatment plan. 

00:54:25
4. Instruct the client to routinely use strategies learned in therapy (e.g., cognitive restructuring, exposure), building them into his/her life as much as possible. 

00:54:30

ARTHUR JONGSMA Sometimes clients benefit from having a coping card or other reminder of important strategies and information regarding relapse prevention. If you decide to use this aid, it can be captured in the treatment plan by including a therapist intervention such as number five.

5. Develop a "coping card" on which coping strategies and other important information (e.g., "pace your breathing." "focus on the task at hand," "you can manage it," and "it will go away") are written for the client's later use.

TIMOTHY BRUCE Finally, periodic sessions of therapy can help maintain positive therapeutic gains. So clients are invited to periodically revisit therapy to strengthen and reinforce their new approach to social situations and/or problem solve challenges. Treatment intervention number six shows use of this option in the treatment plan.

ARTHUR JONGSMA Today's discussion focused on empirically informing treatment plans using goals, objectives and treatment interventions consistent with those found in empirically supported treatments. These treatments must all be delivered within the context of an authentic, emphatic relationship. As you can see, there's a significant body of research in this area. The accompanying guide provides you with additional clinical resources, as well as references to empirical support for the interventions we discussed today.

TIMOTHY BRUCE We want to remind you that the purpose of this series is to demonstrate the process of empirically informed psychotherapy treatment planning for common mental health and substance abuse problems. It is designed to be informative in nature and doesn't intend to be a substitute for clinical training in the interventions discussed or demonstrated.
