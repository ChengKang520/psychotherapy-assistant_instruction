PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you Allen. And we are pleased to continue this series. This is a partnership between Division 45 of the American Psychological Association, the Society of the Education on Training of Cultural and Social Issues as well as Microtraining Associates. So we're very happy to be venturing into this tape series. Again, for the last number of years, the focus on multi-cultural counseling competency has been dom, I don't want to say dominating the profession but it is certainly is coming in very strong. This tape series is designed to introduce culture specific counseling, as well as multi-cultural competency in training and education. This particular tape that we will be sharing with you now involves the perspectives of Latinos in counseling. And presenting will be Dr. Azara Santiago-Rivera from SUNY Albany and Dr. Luiz Vazquez from New Mexico State University. 

00:01:45
ALLEN IVEY  And ah, I would just say that, as we move to the third tape, I am learning an immense amount and feel very lucky and honored to be here with you Patricia, thank you. So, let us begin. 

00:02:00
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ  [non-English narration] Azara, [non-English narration]. 

00:02:05
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  [non-English narration] 

00:02:10
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration] . 

00:02:15
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA [non-English narration]. 

00:02:15
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration]. 

00:02:15
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ  . And today we're going to talk about bilingual therapy and its importance in the United States. As we have seen that, that there are many languages spoken and yet very few therapists who are bilingual. And language creates a form of expressing emotion, a form of being able to, being able to communicate and also a form to express non-verbal behavior. What do you think about that Azara? 

00:02:40
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I certainly think it's important for therapists to understand the dynamics of language in therapy and in counseling. Especially for that kind of a client that comes in knowing both languages. Ah, we ought to be thinking that a person who is, in this case, Spanish speaking bilingual brings to counseling and therapy strengths. The fact that he and, or she speaks, speaks two languages. 

00:03:05
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Yes. Very, very true. I've often seen that because therapists have been often, I would like to use the term language impaired, it becomes very difficult to understand someone in a different language. And, and we would like to introduce today is be able to talk about how language mitigates communication. Not only between the client and the therapist, but also the emotional sense of what language is. 

00:03:30
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Sure. Okay. 

00:03:30
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Okay? 

00:03:30
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah, I'm ready. Are you? 

00:03:30
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Yes, I am. 

00:03:35
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Okay. 

00:03:35
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ In order to demonstrate how language is being used in therapy, Ah, we will be presenting a case. The case of Azara, a 46-year old ah, mother of two. She has two children. One is 17 years old and one is 15 years old. She, she is completely bilingual, wa, was raised basically at home only speaking Spanish and learned English through school and other sources. She, she recently returned to the community college after going through a divorce of being married of 24 years. She recently moved back home with her parents. Her father is retired and disabled and her mother works part-time at a bakery. And a, Azara and I will be talking about Azara, the client. Azara? 

00:04:15
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  Uhm, what I'd like to do is add a bit more information about, about the client that I would be role- playing. Azara, the client, ah, reports that, ah, that both parents argue constantly in the household. And, and we'll demonstrate how, how that's taking place and how's that affecting the client, Azara. Ah, we also would like to add about the client that she's feeling a bit overwhelmed with responsibility of moving back into the household, attending college, not doing very well in college at this point, right? 

00:04:50
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Uh-huh. 

00:04:50
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And also feeling overwhelmed that she now has to raise her two sons and feels some resentment towards her husband who really has not been available emotionally during the time that they were married. So, given that scenario, we would like to begin the role play. 

00:05:10
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Thank you Azara. Now, our role play begins in, in our fourth session. We have met for three sessions and we have discussed some of the family background. We have discussed some of the feelings for the parents. And we have discussed some of the feelings toward her education. So we're going to pick up asking Azara how it's been going since her last session. Hi, Azara. 

00:05:30
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Hello. 

00:05:30
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ How's it going since her last session? 

00:05:35
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, you know, things, ah, things I think are getting a little bit more complicated at home, Dr. Vazquez. Uhm, you know I, I am just feeling very overwhelmed. I'm, I'm feeling very overwhelmed. You know, I, I just, I'm having problems with my mother. I'm having a difficult time with the boys. You know, now with this whole idea of not doing well in school, I mean I just, I thought my life was getting back together and now it, I just feel that things are falling apart. I don't know what to do. You know last week I thought things were better but I just, I don't know, I can't handle this. I really can't. 

00:06:15
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ What's happened since last week? 

00:06:20
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  Well, you know I, I had a really big fight with my mother. It was, it was a big fight. You know, she wants to take over raising the boys and you know, they're not used to this, to this, first of all, mo, moving back home with, with you know their abuelita, their abuelito, the grandparents 

00:06:50
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration] 

00:06:50
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA [non-English narration] 

00:06:50
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ I, I can see the sadness in your eyes. 

00:06:55
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA [non-English narration] 

00:06:55
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration] 

00:06:55
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, I, I don't know. I, I feel a little guilty. I feel very guilty. You know, I'm the oldest, Dr. Luiz, and, ah, and I'm supposed to be the responsible one in the family. I was raised to be the responsible one. But then I have, you know, I've got two boys to take care of and mommy is just getting in the way. And I don't know how to tell her to stay out of the way. The boys, you know don't want to learn about the culture. The boys don't, you know, are not fluent in Spanish and she wants to talk to them in Spanish and she wants to instill, you know, our values but they resist. It's hard. You know, I'm having a lot of conflict with them. 

00:07:45
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Now, is she still having ataque when you're talking to her, when you attempt to talk to her? 

00:07:45
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  Ataques? 

00:07:50
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Si. 

00:07:50
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Oh, boy, yes. She's having ataques. You know, I grew up at home and when I was a kid, she would have the ataques, the nervios as I call them. And this was her way of getting attention, you know. She would complain of headaches, of stomachaches and then you know, we'd, we'd have to drop everything as, as kids and we'd have to take care of her. And you know, I resent that. I really resent that. And at the same time you know, I feel guilty because I'm supposed to take care of her. I'm supposed to. That's what I was raised to do, to take care of her. 

00:08:25
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ  It also sounds like she's working hard and you're working very hard at this too. [non-English narration]. What is going on in here? It's like here, you're talking out here. But I feel very strong, strong, strong feeling inside. 

00:08:45
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA You know I, I, I can't put in words in English what I'm feeling. Is it okay if I tell you in Spanish... (crosstalk) 

00:08:55
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration]. 

00:08:55
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA ...what I'm feeling? Because when I think about, you know, my relationship with my mother, you know the memories I have of her are, I, I can think of them in Spanish and it's, it's hard to describe that in English. Uhm, my feelings are very mixed. I mean I can think, you know, the experiences I have with her growing up. You know, la quiero muchisimo. I love her. But at the same time, 

00:09:25
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  [non-English narration]. 

00:09:30
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm, I'm angry with her because she, she, she, you know, she just was not the kind of mother that I want to be for my boys. 

00:09:40
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ How did you want her to be? [non-English narration] 

00:09:40
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  I wanted her to be, I wanted her to be, to have fun with us. I wanted her to, you know to, to ah, you know, obviously discipline us, you know, us as kids. But I wanted her to take more, you know be part of my life growing up. She was always sick. She was always sick. You know, she always had [non-English narration] and, you know, all we did was take care of her. You know, my brothers and I took care of her. 

00:10:15
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ Remember in the last session when we talked about ataque de nervios with your, with your mom, we also talked about how that represented her being so angry [non-English narration]. She didn't have any other way to express herself. And we talked about that, I'm wondering what's that been like for you because I could still see that strength of your anger coming out. [non-English narration]. 

00:10:35
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA And it is there. It's, it's still very much there. I, I haven't had, I haven't been able to work that through. And you know what? I, I find that the same thing is happening to me. Ah... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration] 

00:10:50
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA ...well, you know, and thinking back the first session that you and I met and we talked about, about all kinds of things. And I came to you, Dr. Vazquez, with the same sort of symptoms. I had a stomachache, headaches, nervousness and it's the same thing that my mother, that my mother showed when I was growing up. I'm being like her. And I'm, I'm angry at that. I don't want to be like her. I want to be different. I want to be me. 

00:11:20
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ  [non-English narration]. In other words, be able to look beyond so share it to me what it's like to actually express your anger. Not by having an ataque but by talking to me. [non-English narration] 

00:11:35
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I, ah, [non-English narration], you know. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:11:45
DR. AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA [non-English narration]. I don't want to be like your mom. I want to be me. I'm angry at you for, for robbing me of my childhood. Mi niñez. You robbed me of that childhood. 

00:11:55
DR. LUIZ VAZQUEZ [non-English narration]. 

00:11:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  [non-English narration]. Uhm, I will. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
LUIZ VASQUEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:12:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I'm angry. And upset. I'm upset, I'm very upset. And you know, I, it's hard for me to express that. Because, you know, I was, I was told not to express, express my emotions that way. 

00:12:15
LUIZ VASQUEZ  Who told you? 

00:12:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA My father. You know, my father told me to always be in control. And I had to be in control. And I had a difficult time expressing my emotions and you know I think that I can, I feel, I feel that I'm able to get started with you and I'm able to express some emotion with you now. And let me tell you, I feel relieved that, you know, I go back home and the same scenario, the same situations. So... (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
LUIZ VASQUEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:12:50
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA ...it's so difficult. 

00:12:50
LUIZ VASQUEZ  [non-English narration]. What is making you hold, hang on to that? 

00:13:00
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  What's making me hold on to that is because I don't wanna be at home living with my parents. I want to be independent. I mean I was married for 23 years and I wanted to be independent and, you know, I had a life. I don't have that life anymore. And I have to go home. So it's hard. 

00:13:20
LUIZ VASQUEZ [non-English narration]. 

00:13:20
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA  Like my husband. My ex-husband. I'm very angry at him. I'm very angry at him because he left me for a younger woman. And I'm angry at him too. I'm very angry with him. This is, it's not easy for me to forgive him. So. 

00:13:40
LUIZ VASQUEZ Have you ever talked to him? 

00:13:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA About this? 

00:13:45
LUIZ VASQUEZ Si. 

00:13:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Ah, no. I haven't, I haven't talked to him about this. We should stop. 

00:13:50
LUIZ VASQUEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:13:55
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
LUIZ VASQUEZ And since I asked you about your, your husband, you smiled right away, and I haven't talked about it. What does that mean? 

00:14:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA The smile is because, I think I wanna hold on to that anger. I don't wanna let it go. 

00:14:10
LUIZ VASQUEZ  Por que? 

00:14:15
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Por que, because I wanna be angry at him for leaving me. I don't wanna let that go yet. 

00:14:25
LUIZ VASQUEZ What do you need? 

00:14:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA I need time. I need time. I really do need lots of more time. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:35
ALLEN IVEY  It's time now for the debriefing. And we have Elsa Casas here. Elsa is a long time friend and colleague at UMass. And I'm going to ask Elsa to ask the first question. 

00:14:50
ELSA CASAS  Uhm, actually, what stood is the question and, ah, and a summary at the same time and that was, what was, what stood out was the issue of anger. Particularly anger among Latino women. Uhm, the inability sometimes to express anger. And I noticed that you really pushed her somewhat to express that and I noticed that she was kinda fighting which is interesting to find out from you being the client what that felt like? 

00:15:25
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Well, ah, it, you know, I think, I think ah, Luiz did a very good job of trying to, to, to get me to express this anger. And to tie the, the anger with, with experiences. For, for example, in a few, in a few places, ah, I, you know, began to remember ah, the experiences that we have talked about and the importance of being able to associate those experiences with the Spanish language. So that was my purpose of switching from, let's say, English to Spanish because it was easier to express the anger by using the Spanish language. And that, once again, the idea of using language that the client's native language, strategically in, in counseling and in therapy to maybe get at some of those emotions that are not easily translated into the English language or that, or that experience in the English language, therefore their coded in, in memory in that Spanish language, that's the, the native language. 

00:16:30
ALLEN IVEY Well, my Spanish skills, as you well know, (laughing) are not particularly strong. So, what would you suggest for me, as a European-American, White, non-Spanish speaking? How can I use what you're talking about? 

00:16:45
LUIZ VASQUEZ And there are several ways. Ah, one of the ways would be is that when you are working with clients who, who are bilingual obviously you, your proficiency is within the English language. So, most of your session will be in English but there'll times that you in English when you access emotion from a client and their, and their language of intimacy maybe Spanish or, or maybe whatever the language they speak. And at that time instead of intervening and not allowing the client to move into their language, allow them to express themselves in their language. Of course, you won't be able to understand what's going on, but there are many non-verbal cues that are expressed through facial expressions, physical expressions and so forth. And, and once a client has, has been on to calm down from the emotion that they're expressing, you'd be able to process that out with them in English and, and that would be one way to use the bilingualism. 

00:17:40
ALLEN IVEY And that's incredibly important. Ah, Jean Jenlin(ph), in his focusing talks about a critical points use the language of the client, he's speaking about English. But I think really, we can pick out, like you say non-verbally, what's going on in the client. And then say it on your way. And then tell me what it means. I think that's, that's very helpful. 

00:18:00
LUIZ VASQUEZ Exactly, ah, and the other would be, if your use a translator, of course that means having lot of training in what your translator, 'cause have to be able to trust the translator. Because a translator becomes an agent of the counselor, and so the counselor is responsible for that translator. Because, really the translator is really there for the counselor, not for the client. We all know the language the client can speak. But the counselor maybe able to use a translator to help become a cultural broker or a medium of communication that allows a counselor to be able to focus more on the, on the non-verbals, while, while the translator participates, is being able to express verbally what's going on with the client and vice versa. And that creates a really nice way of transitioning. However, I would only recommend that only if both parties have been trained, both the counselor and how to work with a translator and also the translator to make sure that the translator does, that you are aware of the translator's world view, their cultural identity, ah, their own (inaudible[00:19:06.291]), and their knowledge of the, of the culture that you're asking him to participate in, within the counseling session with you. And those things, and also the counselor's role, it's difficult because many times counselors feel ineffective and at times handicapped, because they're not able to, to express. And that can be a very frustrating experience. So, I would strongly recommend if you are to go that route to do their training. Of course the best would be with a bilingual counselor. 

00:19:30
ALLEN IVEY Another piece that you'd talked about was the importance of, and I thought it was fascinating, the idea of, of me learning certain key Latina/Latino proverbs, ideas. Could you just share a little more about it with the group. They'd like to hear that. 

00:19:45
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Sure. One of the things ah, that ah, that has been in fact ah, researched and, and found to be quite effective is the use of Spanish proverbs in the counseling session. Certainly, an opportune moment must exist between counselor and client for the counselor to introduce a proverb. The idea is that the proverbs add a, a, an additional dimension to what's happening on a counseling session. And sometimes ah, you can use the Spanish proverbs to actually deal with resistance that might be occurring in a counseling session. And, ah, it, it can be quite effective. Now, the idea here is that you can use the Spanish proverbs, you know, there, there, there a cute, you know, three, three-word proverbs that you can you can, any therapist can learn how to pronounce. And as long you know the meaning behind them, that's what really matters, is the meaning behind them. You could actually introduce them in the counseling session that maybe even connect more with your client. If in fact that the client is, is, is having difficulty, kind of ah, ah, understanding or conceptualizing something or even, or even having some problems expressing, you know, uhm, emotion, you can use the Spanish proverb to trigger, to get client to talk more to you. So it is, it is quite an effective tool. 

00:21:25
ELSA CASAS And I think it happened in this session at the time when you were getting sad and he was saying [non-English narration]... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
LUIZ VASQUEZ  [non-English narration]-(crosstalk) 

00:21:40
ELSA CASAS ... [non-English narration]. That means that the eyes are the mirrors of the soul, and that the tears would be fine for her to express. And that was at that when she was resistant. I mean, I, I'm interpreting here. I got the feeling that you were interpreting letting go of the emotion. And he was using it appropriately and I think that she finally kind of was letting go. Right? 

00:22:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Yeah. 

00:22:05
ELSA CASAS You were able to. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
AZARA SANTIAGO-RIVERA Break it down in tears. The idea was to show that, that we can, we can release an emotion. 

00:22:10
ALLEN IVEY I would say I found your ah, conversation very touching. I found myself wandering off at times I'm thinking about my, (laughing) you made me, I think there are some cross-cultural relations that occurred in yours as well. Ah, would you like to wind up, Elsa? 

00:22:25
LUIZ VASQUEZ One thing to add. 

00:22:25
ELSA CASAS Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
ALLEN IVEY Why won't you (inaudible[00:22:29.126]) 

00:22:25
LUIZ VASQUEZ  Well, one thing that I'd, I, I did reach in and, and, and I attempted to, to get Azara to express her anger because, and that was for two reasons. One reason was, was that I did not want her to repeat the same patterns of those ataques that her mother was experiencing. So, to be able to get permission to express some anger. The second reason, which is a very important one, is because of my gender, being the male Latino counselor, I wanted it to break tradition and socialization that it would be okay to express yourself and allowing herself that experience within the session would also maybe allow herself to be able to work through some of the issues involving her father. And maybe even some of the issues that were directly related to her husband. So with, with our work together it would allow that expression and break the traditional socialization of gender issues across the different cultures. Because as Azara is going to, to college also raising two children, she's very non-traditional and working towards such goals, and this would allow some more assertiveness and a free expression instead of looking for ways of becoming or coping where there were depression, anxiety and so forth. 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY Anything else? That's all right then. 

00:23:45
ELSA CASAS  Well, what I wanted to add was essentially that, that you were thinking about parents and getting old, and, and so on. And in this session i, it focused in multi-dimensional issues that not only a cross-cultural, but specifically the language. The, the comfort, the level of comfort that the two of you felt going back and forth. And I think uhm, for someone who's only bilingual that might not seem as reasonable for people to do. And I think that that might, what we're doing is that, uhm, to allow people to try, try it out and not to feel that you have to know all the words, but just do understand that they will be able to understand by allowing the patient to express themselves and maybe explain some other things. Okay? And just to try it out. So. 

00:24:40
ALLEN IVEY So, thank you all very much. 

00:24:45
LUIZ VASQUEZ Thank you.
