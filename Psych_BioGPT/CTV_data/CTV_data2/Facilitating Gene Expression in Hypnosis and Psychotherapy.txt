Ernest Rossi, PhD 

00:00:55
ERNEST ROSSI So this is the workshop on gene expression and brain plasticity. How do we facilitate them in psychotherapy and therapeutic hypnosis? Actually it's a quite a stretch. Most of this research has been done with animal models and we're generalizing. We're following the implications of modern neuroscience. We've, for hundreds of years known that there are something called the general waking trance. What is the general waking trance? Well, it's heightened attention, focused attention. Something that gains our complete absorption. Today we talk about it in terms of a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, a sense of surprise, sense of uncertainty and it turns out the evolution feels so important are those novel and new things in our environment that actually has a mechanism for turning on gene expression and that could lead to brain plasticity, new levels of awareness in the brain as well as modulating, healing throughout the body via the immune system and so forth. But we've only got a few studies about this. But tonight I like to explore with all of you. Is it really possible for us to talk to our genes? Can we really light the lamps and brighten the lamps of human consciousness with our cycle biological approaches? Okay, so we have this concept of the general waking trance and the miraculous thing is, it seems so more wonderful than we could possibly believe, but that's the function of art, beauty, and truth. Things absorb our immediate interest and give us that sense of elevation, a sense of surprise, a sense of curiosity, and that curiosity is the beginning, the first stage of the four stage creative process. It was later on Leonardo Da Vinci, centuries ago, said yes, when we feel curiosity, it awakens us and we immediately start doing internal work and that internal work is stage 2. We replay the surprise, because we have the question, what is it, what is it, what is it, what is that and nature is that something dangerous I should run away from, or is it something interesting I should approach. Maybe, I can eat it. So this has very deep profound routes in evolution itself. So, that's the kind of experience I like to have you all explore with me this evening, a sense of curiosity, a sense of replaying something that you're curious about and then some of you may even get to stage 3. Ha, you suddenly say oh, that's what's such and such could mean, you get an insight that's the third stage of the creative process and with that, wow what a wonderful feeling comes to us, a feeling of beneficence, a feeling of comfort, warmth, relaxation, and our mind naturally turns to hey, how can I enhance this experience in my real everyday life and that's stage 4. How do we validate our internal insights? What behavioral prescriptions will we give ourselves for behavior change today, tomorrow, next week, next year to continue enhancing ourselves with these interesting fascinating experiences that believe it or not, literally help our brain grow and facilitate our health and well being. So those of you who'd like to explore what's more seemingly more available to us than our own hands. Suppose you raise your hands, don't let them rest in your lap or head up against your neighbor, because we wanna let your hands have the freedom. This is above all, a freedom experience. Look at those hands almost as if, what, almost as if you've never seen those hands before. Yes, and that begins the curiosity. Which of those hands for example would be your sparkly hand, yeah sparkly. When you were a child, you see the fourth of July and you get sparkly and you get interested in something, which hand represents that interest of that young child. And on the other hand, what's the opposite of that interest that you experienced as a child. And then moving on, yes, in your sparkly hand, which, what, yeah, what was, yes, what was your first moment of being aware of yourself, was it before five, was it two, three, was it seven, eight, ten years old and as you begin to review some of those memories of your earliest awareness of yourself, let that sparkly, let that child's hand start to drift down very, very slowly. And you notice, I wanted your hands to be up in the air in the beginning. Because this is an activity dependent approach. I don't want your hands resting in your lap as if you're gonna go to sleep, no it's activity that turns on genes. It's doing something interesting that turns on genes. So, continuing now, the first moments of self awareness. How about another sparkling moment in childhood when, yeah when was the first time that you knew you were smart? Hey, was it in school, if you knew something about A, B, Cs, or was it at home, your mom or your dad was surprised that you knew something. Yes, that's what we're looking for and what was that feeling like. Knowing something and having questions and having, yes, what were you curious about as a kid? Was it animals? Was it ants? Was it a cat? Was it a flower? Was it a babbling brook? yes, what were the things that charmed your interest that staged one of the creative process and as your hand continues moving on into adolescence, yes, what could be more profound and that a new feelings that come to us an adolescent. Yes, hey, what's the first time you fell in love? Was it with one of your school mates? What were you? Were you five or six like I was or were you 11 or 12? Yeah, what was that? Do you remember the name of the little boy or little girl you're in love with? Or were you more ambitious with that than that you were in love with your teacher maybe. What's your teacher's name? Yes, we are trying to really enhance tune in to the liveliest experiences of childhood that yes, turn on your genes, shape your brain and made you what you are becoming even now today. So continuing now with your other hand, if it's going to be okay to explore another year or two, 14, 15, 16, some of the surprising experiences, 17, 18, 19 and that the other hand drifting down. Hey, how about some of the secrets that you promised yourself as a teen, even as a child maybe, yes, when you grow up you were gonna be, what, yeah, what are you gonna do. And knowing that all of this remains private within you. Yes, almost very often, our most private experiences are the most important ones. So important, we dare not even breathe a word about it to anyone. Yes, and is there something that that young person, that teen, maybe even into your young 20s needs to say to your adult self now. Is there something that your adult self can say to your young teen? Yes, what's the most important meaning, what's the most exciting? What's the most mysterious? What's the most tremendous? What's the most magnificent, and as both hands drift down to your lap now, yes, you've received something and yes, can you go on to stage 4 when knowing what's some of these sparkly things, but some of these inspirational creative things have been in your past. Can you see a pattern, a connection and can you tell yourself even now, yes, what are you going to do to receive this essence of creativity and your growing brain actually in every cell of your body. So, now I'm looking around a room, I'm looking for someone who I could do an individual demonstration with and to make it easy, I'd prefer to see someone jump up from the first or second row. Someone who feels, hey, they have an interesting experience and interest memory they'd like to share. Or hey, it could be the opposite. Maybe you're disappointed with this exercise, it's your stuck. Yes, if you are stuck you are in stage 2 of the creative process. You've been replaying but you never got to the exciting part. So is there anyone in front two rows, who's maybe, yes sir, perhaps a little bit down. Let's see what our volunteer is really want to come up and sign the required sheet and this will be your person you have to sign a permission sheet for. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:05
ERNEST ROSSI So this is indeed spontaneous and unrehearsed. I've never met this person. I don't know what to expect. Did he have a bright idea, did he get something exciting or is he stuck like most people are when they come to our office. So, all looking for positive experiences this way. How do they get them? Sometimes we replay over and over again. A negative idea, a negative way of handling yourself in the world, negative ways of treating yourself and actually thereby cutting off the heightened activity that turns on gene expression, brain growth health and healing. Okay, your name is? 

00:14:00
SOLOMON Solomon. 

00:14:05
KATHRYN Solomon. 

00:14:05
ERNEST ROSSI Solomon. Solomon, I have a hearing impairment. It's obvious from these humongous hearing aids. So, excuse me, this is why I have to have my wife here and she she's tuned in and she'll often, I’ll often to look to her. So, it's not a reflection of you, it's a reflection of my handicap. So, what was your experience in the little group exercise, Solomon? 

00:14:35
SOLOMON Well, it was, I kinda flashed a different really sweet memories when I was a kid of important doubts that I just felt special around. 

00:14:45
ERNEST ROSSI You felt special 

00:14:45
KATHRYN Adults, adults around him in that he's felt, felt special around. 

00:14:50
SOLOMON And a sense of wonder and excitement about. Everything looked magical and exciting. Great. 

00:15:00
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah, was that associated with the adults did you say? 

00:15:05
SOLOMON Well, with more adults than kids. 

00:15:05
ERNEST ROSSI Ah! You experienced it as an adult? 

00:15:10
SOLOMON No, no as a child, but more trigged by it, more related to adults. 

00:15:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, triggered by the presence of adults and so forth. Wow, how does that translate to the here and now Solomon? Do you have adults or guys or people you look forward to for similar experiences? 

00:15:35
SOLOMON Well, I look forward to everybody. 

00:15:40
ERNEST ROSSI Everybody? 

00:15:40
SOLOMON Yeah, yeah I love people. 

00:15:45
ERNEST ROSSI And is it going well? 

00:15:45
SOLOMON Yeah. 

00:15:45
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. So your growing edge is often with people? What's while keeping your privacy of course, Solomon, what are some of the exciting growing edges with people that you're experiencing now? 

00:16:00
SOLOMON : Well, I just want every time I meet somebody who's or including people I know well or first time it doesn't matter but whenever somebody's really there and really will look into my eyes and I can see them and they can see me then, I just feel like I get lost in this beautiful world. 

00:16:25
ERNEST ROSSI Get lost in the beautiful? 

00:16:25
SOLOMON A nice kind of lost. 

00:16:25
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic. I feel myself doing this. I don't know if you feel if you want to imitate me, but is it really a bigger, a bigger world you're getting into. And wow, look at this audience is huge. This is our life space, Solomon, is it not? Can we really be lucky? I don't know if there's anybody in the audience who feels so lucky that they can also stretch and just feel the space around them. The growing edges around them. Wow! Can gene expression and brain plasticity really be this easy? 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:30
ERNEST ROSSI So continue for yet another moment Solomon on a scale of one to ten where ten is maybe the happiest or highest or best you felt of yourself, five is average and 1 would be pretty not too excited. How do you feel, what number are you experiencing now. 

00:17:55
SOLOMON Well, a solid seven. 

00:17:55
KATHRYN Seven. 

00:17:55
SOLOMON Yeah 

00:17:55
ERNEST ROSSI Seven? Fantastic, okay. 

00:18:00
SOLOMON I what excited means I was sort of thinking that I can't see anybody's eyes really but I gathered that if I, each person if I could see their eyes, I know its possible. 

00:18:10
ERNEST ROSSI That would be even more enhancing. 

00:18:15
SOLOMON Well, yeah but actually it's knowing it that is enhancing. Just knowing that everybody out there is amazing. Makes me very happy. 

00:18:25
ERNEST ROSSI Is there someone in the audience who's eyes you'd like to look at to work right with you that would enhance your state even higher than seven. 

00:18:35
SOLOMON Well it could be anybody's or it could be yours or yours. Okay. You want me to pick somebody or I am really open. 

00:18:50
ERNEST ROSSI Does anyone in the first couple of rows, yes, here we have. 

00:18:55
KATHRYN Oh! here's Louis Coffman. 

00:18:55
SOLOMON Hi. 

00:18:55
LOUIS COFFMAN Hi. 

00:18:55
LOUIS COFFMAN Hi. You're eyes sparkle. 

00:19:00
KATHRYN Louis says your eyes sparkle. 

00:19:05
SOLOMON Thank you. So do yours. 

00:19:10
ERNEST ROSSI Sparkly eyes, thank you. 

00:19:10
SOLOMON That's great. 

00:19:15
ERNEST ROSSI How this is foreseen in your life Solomon? Start with your morning wakeup and what's it like waking up for you? 

00:19:25
SOLOMON Well, I just wanna spend time alone, which is good. 

00:19:30
ERNEST ROSSI You spend time alone? 

00:19:35
SOLOMON Yeah, yeah I'm doing my stuff. 

00:19:40
ERNEST ROSSI And how do you get into your day and how do you create a beautiful sparkly day? What works for you? What's the, you know, every hour and half or two throughout the day we go to a normal cycle of creative process, energy comes up for an half an hour, quarter or two-quarters of an hour and then it goes down and we need to rest. What's your first up cycle, the first lift in your day? 

00:20:10
SOLOMON Well, first lift is lying in bed just letting whatever thoughts come to me. 

00:20:15
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, so that's wonderful. That's what I call just receiving your early morning thoughts and what kind of again respecting your privacy Solomon, what's the areas of your thoughts? what's cooking up there? what's your growing edges? 

00:20:35
SOLOMON I feel like growing edge is really once I get to work. 

00:20:40
ERNEST ROSSI Your growing edge, once you get to work and your work is? 

00:20:40
SOLOMON I'm a therapist. 

00:20:45
ERNEST ROSSI I see. So, you have people coming to a office, fantastic. 

00:20:50
SOLOMON Yeah, and I do a lot of teaching. So, like just being with teaching and being with clients is heaven for me. Yeah, just being with people in a real deep way. I love that. 

00:21:05
ERNEST ROSSI So, really you get your sense of growth through your actual work. Your one of the lucky people. Work does not drain you, it's not debilitating, it's not stressful. Wow, you're what Maslow a call a being motivation person. You are into that being, becoming rather than deprivation. You know, you're the kind of the guy all of us want to know here. We want to be able to do what you do. So, I really love to hear from you, what would be can you say a few words about one of your most fascinating interactions with a client, again respecting yours and their privacy, how do you know you're having a great session with a client, what is happening? What's the typical pattern? 

00:22:05
SOLOMON Wow! That's a great question, there's so many, let me just think a second. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
SOLOMON Well, I think it’s when I watch people come to life. 

00:22:25
ERNEST ROSSI Yes that's it. Your hands just came to life, continue with that Solomon, that's right, coming to life, it's almost like we did in the beginning of our session here. You like seeing people come to life. So continue that movement and as you replay the movement, can you replay a recent session in your mind with a client, where you saw the client come to life and you can do all that privately Solomon. Although occasionally you might wanna a share a sentence or two that's appropriate to be shared, about the signs you saw of this client coming to life and how you I presume using your mirror neurons came to life as well. Continue, that's right, really continue. 

00:23:20
SOLOMON Well, sometimes it's seeing in their eyes them coming to life and sometimes it's a really Sparkly way and sometimes it's almost the opposite where they suddenly, a person settles down and really feels himself in a solid way. And sometimes it's something personal that happens in them and sometimes it's between me and the person where we're we join in a way and I just know that they haven't connected with somebody like that since they were a child and I feel so honored that I get to be the person they're closest to. In that moment, they're the person I'm closest to and I know that, that will continue forever even if I never saw them again that, that we now have this thing that happened between us and in each of us that is the universe in a moment. 

00:24:20
ERNEST ROSSI What number are you at right now as we described in this? 

00:24:25
SOLOMON Eight at least. 

00:24:30
ERNEST ROSSI So, it's getting higher, isn't it? Okay, what's that? How do you feel it in your body, that getting higher up to eight. 

00:24:40
SOLOMON Well, I feel the shivers inside. 

00:24:40
ERNEST ROSSI Shivers inside? Fantastic. Yes, yeah, that's, we call the, yes beautiful. So shivers turns on gene expression and brain plasticity, fantastic. Give us another clue, Solomon to your being motivation, how that really works for you? 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:10
ERNEST ROSSI And the audience might notice, I follow Solomon, I 'd rather follow him rather than having him follow me. My following him of course my mirror neurons are picking up states, and getting in resonance with him and since it's a high state, yeah that I would hypothesize as turning on gene expression. Wow, this certainly feels good. And again some of you in the audience might wanna imitate this a little bit. Can it also feel good die at this moment. Is it, I feel as if the stretch, the little extra stretch and it's kind of exhilarating high feeling. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic and I don't know if the Buddha actually did stuff like this. All those yogis and gurus, medicine people we see all kinds of gestures like this in the archeological, anthropological literature. This is like a salutation to the morning, to the day. That's right. I really encourage even more of you in the audience to just recognize. Yes, I look up. I see these lights and I can well imagine this is sun that's charred(ph) across the sky and each of us, a unique universe celebrating the vast stretch. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:30
ERNEST ROSSI And even now I recognize, I'm unusually half asleep at this time of the evening. I'm not half asleep now. Yes, 

00:27:45
[sil.] 

00:27:50
ERNEST ROSSI Do you have children Solomon? 

00:27:50
SOLOMON Everybody. 

00:27:55
KATHRYN Everybody's children. 

00:27:55
SOLOMON I feel, well I don't literally but sometimes I feel like everybody's my child. 

00:28:00
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic. This is much better, much further than I've gone along. You are my guru. What a marvelous idea. You were really my guru. You stretched me a little bit this evening. I really appreciate it. Any of you in the audience feel a little bit stretched. Solomon would it be okay address the audience to say. So, this is a nice example of a professional that really gets it. He has a practice. He wakes up and he has that wonderful feeling. He explores it and in his daily work how old were you when knew were going to become a psychologist therapist Solomon? 

00:29:00
SOLOMON  It's 15 or 16. 

00:29:05
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic. Now I'd like to tune into audience. We see Solomon who here would not say this guy could be my teacher. This guy is my model. Others somewhat is there another person in the audience would like to volunteer take the seat that Solomon's in and talk about any negative issues it might have about coming to the state that Solomon's already achieved and is even now helping me achieve. Is anyone stuck in stage 2 of the creative process. My goodness we're really all are not more enlightened. Surely, there's no one whose got. 

00:29:55
KATHRYN Keep looking in that direction 

00:29:55
ERNEST ROSSI  We have a volunteer. 

00:30:00
SOLOMON You want me to go down? 

00:30:00
KATHRYN  Yes, we do. 

00:30:05
ERNEST ROSSI Is that person being signed up. Come up. Great. 

00:30:15
KATHRYN Thank you so much. 

00:30:15
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you Solomon 

00:30:15
KATHRYN What a pleasure. 

00:30:20
ERNEST ROSSI Thank you buddy. 

00:30:20
KATHRYN Oh, I think it’s also attached to your pocket. Thank you so much. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:40
ERNEST ROSSI So, this evening we'll have a chance perhaps to explore the whole range of possibilities of where we are as therapists. When we're high and when we have issues and how do we enhance our own ability to work through issues which to me usually means the four stage creative process. How do we get curious about our issues and begin to explore and incubate and replay those issues until we get a click. Okay. I should read from your name tag, this is Willard Pearce Peterson. 

00:31:30
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yes. 

00:31:30
ERNEST ROSSI Fantastic Willard. Thank you for coming up. What’s your issue that you like to deal with? 

00:31:35
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON  Well, I’m in recovery from life. 

00:31:45
ERNEST ROSSI Recovery from life. 

00:31:45
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yes. 

00:31:45
ERNEST ROSSI Wow! 

00:31:45
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON  And I can’t figure out what it is. 

00:31:50
ERNEST ROSSI Say it again. 

00:31:50
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON  Can’t figure out what it is. 

00:31:55
ERNEST ROSSI You can’t figure out what it is. Would you like to go right into a therapeutic process to help you figure that out? 

00:32:05
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON  Yeah, I’d like as much help as quick as I can get it. 

00:32:10
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Wonderful Willard. Let’s do it as quick as you can. Place your hands what like so and which hand represents this issue you’re trying to recover from life as it is. Which is it your left or your right hand that expresses this? 

00:32:30
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON  The right hand is heavier. 

00:32:35
ERNEST ROSSI Heavier, okay. 

00:32:35
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON So I'd say the right hand. 

00:32:35
ERNEST ROSSI  And continue feeling that hand heavy with the weightiness of your issue Willard. And at the same time in your other hand lets see what you’ve begun to experience privately within yourself that's the opposite of this heavy hand. And let me know when you got it there and this goes back over 2,000 years to Lao Tzu and his Dao De Jing, his early philosophy, what is life. How does one create a great society, a great mind and he said the key was in exploring the opposites. So, whatever issue yes, the client projects it in one hand and I would say what’s the opposite and keep it private because most of my work is done privately and do you have the opposite in the other hand Willard? 

00:33:40
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I have lightness. 

00:33:40
ERNEST ROSSI Lightness, lets go with that. So, continue. You can see that Willard's hands actually is lifting very slowly. This is an ideal dynamic response, an ideal plastic response. That’s the kind of plasticity we’re exploring in gene expression and brain plasticity. So, as that hand continues lifting more or less by itself Willard. Let's see what happens to the other hand. Does it get engaged with your left hand? Does it drop away? Does it is there a dance, and so a drama that takes place in that mind, body, space between the hand and yes I think of space as the Shakespearean theater is between the opposites, dealing with the opposites that were – that turns on the curiosity, the creative process, gene expression and my goodness we’ve really got some energy going there Willard. I really really like to appreciate that and those of you who are close can see the eye behavior, the tearing of the eyes. Yes, these are the minimal cues, a meaningful experience happening. So, that's very beautiful Willard and at the same time I usually don’t say this to my clients but I have a teaching role here. You see that the other hand that was heavy is also vibrating slightly and seemingly going up but as, and notice that Willard's gaze follows that left hand. So, really continue with that Willard, and let’s see what comes to you privately as you focus your gaze and you feel that life. Yes, the widening of the fingers and I really don’t know what private thoughts you're having about -- yes, this other state of lifting that you know you need to experience to get a better balance to move toward. Yes, that wonderful vibration very characteristic of this general waking trance. Let that simply continue. This is like a drama, this is like a novel, this is like a play, this is like a chapter in a book. Yes, what chapter would Willard give to his experience. Yes, what metaphor will come to his mind that he can later share with us about the meaning of this lift? That's gonna help him cope with the heaviness with which he began this session this evening. Wonderful Willard. Truly wonderful and can some of you close by notice the tension, the vibration. Yes, Willard is stretching and what could possibly be mean, the meaning of this stretching. Yes, each of us is forming a metaphor in our minds as we observe him how profound the privilege of sharing this experience of stretching. We can see the changing color in Willard’s face. That’s right the beauty. If you went through a classical art gallery and you saw the gestures of the saints of the centers of the gods, are you seeing Willard to manifest this? So, this is our beauty and truth and our work. This is why I tend to use the hands to facilitate activity dependent gene expression. It's this effort, this heightening of consciousness not sleep, not disassociation. Yes, really enjoying that Willard. On the one hand experiencing it fully Willard, and on the other hand watching yourself experience that some part of you wisely standing aside and taking very good care of you. Do you see how I as a therapist hand over the therapeutic process I empower the client. Its not me whose taking care of Willard, it's not me that has a special sense of enlightenment or secret higher knowledge but rather its this part of Willard that is expressed in his left hand. Yes, this is mind, hand we’re making the creative unconscious visible, visible behavior and that’s what we’re doing. And its Willard who knows the simple truth as that hand starts drifting down slightly it seems and as your – yes, so as that left hand goes down and the right hand with equal suddenly goes up, what’s going to happen between these two sides of Willard's personality? Is there going to be a coming together? Will there be a clash, a conflict? Yes, and as I look at Willard, his eyelids are almost closed. Of course, I never tell a person to close their eyes because that’s a natural signal, that their eye close, that tells me something they're going even more deeply into their inner focus and now as eyelids are those are who are close can see the vibratory flutter almost like we see in REM sleep, rapid eye movement. That’s wonderful Willard, wonderful really experiencing on one level the profoundness and on the other level, watching yourself with, yes with what attitude you watch, yes, the vibration of this hand. Yes, look at that incredible extra vibration in the right hand. So this is IDU dynamic processing. This is why I use the hands to allow the client to project their inner processes out there where we can see them. I once asked Erickson, what does it mean when clients are going through that vibration, and when the world's greatest hypnotherapist says well you know he's, you know I really don’t know, I think its because they're engaged in some kind of uncertainty back and forth and now we see that movement has stopped. So, allow yourself to continue privately within yourself Willard. And when I make this motion I’m showing the audience that I’m saying to myself “Shut up stupid, let the client do their own work, be engaged in their own process.” In my private practice I’m completely silent when I see a person's engaged. They don’t need me. I could only be a distraction and yet Willard is so profoundly engrossed in his general waking trance that he doesn’t see perturbed by my talking to the audience. Notice how the hands are placed. They’re not flat like that, but there is just barely touching. There’s a symmetry and there’s a poise. He's not flat out relaxed, no there is a - Erickson called this balanced muscle tonicity, a kind of very light catalepsy where a person's completely still and yet who do you see in everyday life that’s completely still holding their hands and now as I speak we see his hands are relaxing into his lap and that’s what happens between stage three and stage four of the creative process. Now, a person relaxes. It’s the relaxation that comes with a job well done. I did not suggest relaxation yet if you want to suggest relaxation to your clients, oh yeah that works too, but how much more profound if you see arousal happening, going from stage one to stage two, a reaching sometimes a crisis between stage two and stage three and then gradually a relaxing happening and the hand starting to go down. Erickson called this as hand levitation approach, but notice I never even use the hand levitation, I never suggested the hand was going to go up, he felt it light. He discovered it going up. So, do you see how I manage or setup a situation where the client creates an experience and I like another part of his mind, stand aside and wonder how that is important and now we see another classic portrait. How often do you see someone sitting like Willard? Classic paintings in museums, the person his age resting there. Yeah, this is art, this is real art. And notice Willard never has, hasn’t said a word really since he began the general waking trance. Some people do when talking of course I listen and receive, but I always emphasize their privacy because in their privacy they're able to transcend the limitations of verbal skills. They're able to step out of the ego into non-verbal behavior perhaps more right hemispheric behavior wherein transformations can very very quickly. They don’t have to be labored with alphanumeric tedious processing, a one single and you notice this light swallowing following, yes again the vibratory flutter of the eyelids yes, the slight adjustment in posture. Does this just suggests Willard is still working through stage four. Is he going to be giving him some behavioral prescriptions, some suggestions of what the meaning of this experience has been for him and what changes he start making in his life. Yes, that would be consummation much to be desired. Willard can give himself his own prescriptions and what would be like Willard. And Willard has opened his eyes, of course I haven’t told him. See the client pace is their own pacing I don’t know if anyone's kept the time but it seems – how long, how much time do you think you've been doing this work? 

00:46:55
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Five minutes. 

00:47:00
ERNEST ROSSI Five minutes. Well, I didn’t keep the record but I’m sure it was probably at least double that. In other words, he experienced that time condensation, which is very characteristic in creative work. You know when you’re doing very interesting time seems to go quickly, that’s what the most reliable sign. 

00:47:20
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON It was 15 minutes. 

00:47:20
ERNEST ROSSI It was 15 minutes. Thank you Kathryn. 

00:47:25
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Thank you. 

00:47:25
KATHRYN And that’s ah... 

00:47:25
ERNEST ROSSI Kathryn's been looking at my watch I've.. 

00:47:25
KATHRYN  Oh, just speaking, I’m trained well you see because when there's a time distortion within the course of a trance that’s one of the hallmarks that really, you’ve really be in trance and how beautiful is that. 

00:47:45
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Very. I don't sit comfortably in my body very often. The times that I do are memorable moments, memorable minutes and I’m not sure exactly what work I did but the calmness is the prevailing experience. 

00:48:15
ERNEST ROSSI Right now. 

00:48:15
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yes. 

00:48:15
ERNEST ROSSI  Fantastic. Did I ever say relax, did I ever say calm down be serene. Never, never, never. Are the client – I’d leaded them into an – creative activity that comes from within and they achieve their relaxation. So, this is the difference between the way we work today and classic ways of suggesting and programming of the past which of course we don’t do anymore we have much more subtle by our empowering our clients to really have their own original experience as they join. Have you ever worked this way before Willard? 

00:49:05
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I’ve studied Erickson's work for a lot of years. 

00:49:10
ERNEST ROSSI Really. 

00:49:10
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON As a matter of fact, I have a mechanical issue with reading. I’ve never enjoyed reading I went through a college without reading a book full through. 

00:49:25
ERNEST ROSSI  Wow! And still you made it through. 

00:49:30
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I’m surprised I did too. Actually I flunked out of one but knew I want an education so bad I went to another one and... 

00:49:40
ERNEST ROSSI So, you were flunking until you got to a place where you could really succeed. Here's to all flunkies in the audience. Long may we fly on. This is really a growth process Willard's been engaged in. Until you ended up with the bum in (inaudible ). 

00:50:03
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I got introduced to Erickson through Jay Haley’s work when I was working on my Masters in Marriage/Family and Child therapy and just became very avid reader not just of... 

00:50:15
ERNEST ROSSI Became an avid reader when something really picked you curiosity, engaged you creatively. That’s with the Haley/Erickson. 

00:50:25
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yes, I still to his day when I’m not -- when I’m reading something not in that vein still have a lot of mechanical issues with a reading I had, I have remnants of dyslexia I guess, but huh..that, I just worked through that, I don’t make it an issue, I just accept it as.. 

00:50:55
ERNEST ROSSI Worked through the mechanical difficulties on the energy of the high motivation that, yes. 

00:51:00
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yeah. 

00:51:05
ERNEST ROSSI So, this is true mind, body healing in a profound sense. 

00:51:10
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON One other issue that I’m continuing to work on and this work will help me is my relationship with anger. Anger was a survival thing for me in my early childhood. My mother and father both had intimate relationships with alcohol, but I was never physically abused and I always knew I was loved to the best of their ability. My anger now gets in the way of my relationship with my son-in-law and my son, my daughter is much more patient with me and my wife has learned to tolerate the storms they were past. I am trying to figure out how to have a less detrimental relationship with anger. I’m trying to figure out where to put it appropriately in my life. I don’t think anger is inappropriate all the time, but I do believe that there are times when it's detrimental. Detrimental to my – my feeling in control of myself. 

00:52:55
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

00:52:55
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON And detrimental to what I want the relationships in my life to be. 

00:53:00
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

00:53:05
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON And fortunately my son-in-law and is learning how to deal with me on that. My son and I still have work to do on that but this work will help me with that.. 

00:53:25
ERNEST ROSSI Okay, wonderful. You’ve been through the developmental, what would you call the developmental path of working through the addiction of your parents and associated with that addiction was abuse to you. 

00:53:45
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Not physical abuse. 

00:53:45
ERNEST ROSSI I see... 

00:53:50
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I knew they loved at the best they could. 

00:53:50
ERNEST ROSSI Yeah. 

00:53:50
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON And I guess that’s all parents can ever do is love their children to the best of their ability. 

00:54:00
ERNEST ROSSI Is there anything in this brief experience this evening Willard that gives you a sense of how you can progress even more adequately working with yourself working with others. Any, what kind of a behavioral prescription would you give yourself based on what you’ve experienced? 

00:54:20
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Not that I can language, but something that I can take in terms of feelings. 

00:54:25
ERNEST ROSSI Yes. 

00:54:25
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON The calmness but not that I can language. I can’t say I know in the next experience I'll do this, but the calmness I know has to be a part of the – part of what I accepted myself and... 

00:54:45
ERNEST ROSSI This calmness is gonna be a cue that your on the right path. This is gonna be your guide, this is a guru, that calm feeling. This is your enlightenment and the fact that it's coming within, enlightenment and this is. Okay, I’m getting the three minute time signal? Is there a metaphor you would use to summarize your session with us this evening or is there a title of this chapter of your life? 

00:55:30
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON There’s nothing coming right now. There’s nothing coming right now. 

00:55:35
ERNEST ROSSI There’s nothing coming cognitively it seems to be on the feeling level. 

00:55:40
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Yes. 

00:55:40
ERNEST ROSSI Yes, you have a genius for feeling and a particular genius you found tonight is that calm feeling or do you feel it throughout your body Willard. The calmness, where are you feeling it? 

00:56:00
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Amazingly throughout my body. 

00:56:00
KATHRYN  Wow!. 

00:56:05
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON I’ve always had a -- I’ve always had a tension. I did an exercise in the workshop the other day where we and I’ve done a lot of body relaxation stuff that we started with our left toe and came up through our knee and I’ve always had a tension in my knee and when we got to the belly I just, I just the language left me, I just didn’t hear the rest of the instruction, but I was left with the tension and that tension is not in my body right now. 

00:56:40
ERNEST ROSSI It's not in your body. 

00:56:40
KATHRYN Beautiful. 

00:56:40
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON It's not in my body. 

00:56:45
ERNEST ROSSI So, that’s the gift, the new step you've been able to take, complete freedom of tension and this is what you’re gonna be, this is your behavior prescription, this is your salvation. 

00:56:55
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON So, I don’t need a metaphor. 

00:57:00
ERNEST ROSSI Right, you don't. 

00:57:00
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON For metaphor it comes. 

00:57:00
ERNEST ROSSI Thank heaven's. I've hated metaphors for you. They're so popular, I said well maybe I should them, but here we see Willard's transcending metaphor because it's in the feeling intervention. Okay Willard, with a smile like that.. 

00:57:20
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Thank you. 

00:57:20
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. 

00:57:20
WILLARD PEARCE PETERSON Thank you. Thank you very much. 

00:57:20
KATHRYN You’re welcome. 

00:57:25
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Okay, so this is my creative approach. This is the four stage creative process. This I presume it's this kind of heightening of original experience, he’s finding his own path to healing. I presume this is what’s turning on gene expression, brain plasticity and mind, body healing. It's something that’s created in the client with the help of the therapist recognizing some of the cues to help the client get on their path. Okay thank you very much. 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:25
ERNEST ROSSI Okay. Another time, another place perhaps, we’ll meet again. 

00:58:30
