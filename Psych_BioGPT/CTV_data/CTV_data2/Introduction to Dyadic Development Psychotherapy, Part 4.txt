00:00:00
DAN HUGHES Why don't we just face to what we go to do in the beginning which is we really got to find an environment, we got to get people support the parents, support the teachers, support the residential workers, get the therapy, get all that in place. Why do we gotta do that? So we don't waste more time. How do we do that? It needs money. Medicine is cheap. And so people don't like the fact that many of this interventions that are gonna have long term success for these kids need money. You need a lot of adults around with good training and support to be able to do it. And I'm sorry, I'm over time. And Arthur is getting annoyed. Oh, he may not. Art doesn't get annoyed, he just gets even. 

00:00:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's a little closer to the truth. Okay. Uh, I'm gonna show you, umm… three clips of a girl I worked with umm… this last year. She's… I think, 11, if I remember correctly. Adopted, umm… when was pretty young, maybe like five years old. So she's been in the family for a bit. Uh, developmentally delayed, lower IQ. What brought them in is she, uh, was aggressive. She would hit her mother, punch her, uh, hit her sister, umm… you know, she would just get physically aggressive. And she's a, uh, you can see she is a big kid. Umm… so when I'm gonna show you her three clips, the first clip is, umm… the, umm… girl, umm… hitting her mother in a session. So you get a chance to see that and I want to just point out, as it goes through some very important, uh, elements in the way the mother, I think, very, very effectively manages this, okay? Umm… especially the way she makes sure it doesn't escalate. Okay, it's a great example of, you know, how many people does it take to have an argument? How many? Two, right. So if you don't argue, right, so you'll, I think you'll see a good example of that. And then we go to a, umm… another clip. Umm… and you'll see she's now more integrated, she talks a bit about, uh, herself. We see her reflective abilities. And then we go to another clip. Umm… I think the second two have the father in there, too. But anyway, as I mentioned before, if you have, uh, any questions, I will stop at periodical. But if you have any questions about something, please just raise your hand, I'll pause it. And, you know, we can, kind of, discuss that. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Michaela, stop. (inaudible ). Come on. 

00:02:30
MICHAELA No. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Come on, you need to calm down. 

00:02:30
MICHAELA No, no, no, no. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN I know you're angry. Now, is this the time when you have me confused with Ann? 

00:02:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So what the mom says there is, "Is this the time when you have me confused with Ann?" Ann, umm… is her birth mother. And that was, uh, a fairly recurrent theme in the session that something might happen that would trigger some… not a, not a cognitive memory, okay, but an experiential memory. And that that's what Michaela would be responding to. Umm… and of course, that was helpful for Michaela to begin to create a narrative that could make sense of her behavior in a non-blaming, non-judgmental way. But also for the mom, umm… that understanding allowed her to not get as disturbed and upset by this kind of behavior. Okay? Because she could, she could really understand it. So if she asks her that. Not that she expects an answer, but she's just trying to, kind of, talk out loud and reflect on the experience. And help her daughter learn how to do it. Recognizing that any one or two experiences won't change it, but after many, many repetitions that may, umm… in fact make it go. 

00:03:40
MICHAELA No. No. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN No? 

00:03:45
MICHAELA No. Let them go. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Come on, (inaudible ) Come on, come on. 

00:03:50
MICHAELA Mom, let go. Let go. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Sit down. I'll let go when you sit down and relax. Come on. 

00:03:55
MICHAELA See… 

00:04:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So what the mom says is, 'cause the mom is, you know, as moms doesn't want to get, you know, punched in the head or something she says, "I'll let go." Because Michaela says, "Let go," 'cause she's holding her hands, 'cause mom doesn't want to be scratched or hit or slapped. And mom says, "I'll sit… I'll let go when you relax," right? Michaela sits down and yanks her hands away, right? And that if the mom, if the mom wanted to, she could have turned that into a really nice large battle by saying, "No. I said I won't let go until you calm down," right? But she recognized again her level of attunement with this child. Her connectedness allowed her to recognize that it probably was okay. The kid was, you know, it wasn't doing exactly what she asked her to do. But she was beginning to calm down. She… mom was safe. And so she lets go and the girl sits down and then, you know, begins to get herself organized. Right? So it's a nice, I think, example of, of how, umm… to manage that kind of beginning dysregulation that you sometimes see with kids, uh, both at home and in the office. What, what, what hurts? 

00:05:10
MICHAELA My heart. Remember, I told you, you told me all these things that I have done good? 

00:05:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Really? Okay, umm… what I'm talking about with her is, umm… we had just been talking about something, uh, uh, positive that she'd done. And, umm… she got upset, didn't want to talk about it. What she says is, umm… "It, it hurts my heart when you talk about good things I've done." And so that's, you know, curious. Again, I don't understand that. That doesn't quite make sense to me. So that reflects what? My lack of empathy. So I want to explore that with her to figure that out, why would that be? So you'll see we, we do that. You're saying that you hearing about the good things hurts your heart? 

00:05:55
MICHAELA Yes. 

00:06:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Huh? And, and what about hearing these good things hurts your heart? Or how does it hurt your heart? 

00:06:10
MICHAELA Some of the bad things that I did for the good things. 

00:06:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, so when we talk, so when I tell you all of the good things you've done, it makes you think about all of the bad things you did too? 

00:06:20
MICHAELA Yes. 

00:06:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And that's what hurts you. 

00:06:20
MICHAELA Yes. 

00:06:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So what she… Did you hear that? Oh, some of you, no. Some of you, yes. So I like the people who heard it. So I can know. So, uh, what she said was, umm… when I talk about all the good things she's done, it hurts her heart because it reminds her of all the bad things she did. Okay. So, you know, for, for a kid like her, that's a, that's a very, I think, pretty advanced reflective, uh, comment. Okay. And that's what you're seeing here is, these we're, kind of, working on developing her reflective abilities. I want to understand what makes this difficult. She's able to think about it. And then we can, we can have a dialogue about it. And then she can begin to understand it better. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN That was very powerful when they'll forget to say, that hurts my party, right? 

00:07:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN I mean… Listen, I… I… would inappropriate to of just stay with, with that and what, what that felt like, you know, to you as a therapist (inaudible ) expression and… 

00:07:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, uh, yeah. I think that would have been a reasonable path to follow. At first, I wanted to understand, what about talking about good things would hurt her heart. Okay. 'Cause she just said that and that didn't make sense to me, right? So I want to understand it, so that we're in sync again. So I got to figure that out with her, and we do. It's because the good things remind her the bad things. And then yes, with that, would have been another, I think, path to, to, to follow, uh, with her. Oh, I see, okay. Now I know, that makes sense. Okay. Well, do you worry that… Do you ever worry that if your mom is angry about those other things you used to do? You'd do. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN No, I'm really not. I'm not angry. I understand why it happened. You're not angry about me. 

00:08:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So the mom is saying, I'm not angry. I understand it. But, umm… that doesn't really get to Michaela's experience. I could see why you feel bad about all those things you used to do. But you're not doing them now, are you? 

00:08:35
MICHAELA No. 

00:08:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No? You're getting stronger and… 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN She sure is. 

00:08:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And, you know, it's okay to feel bad, to, to regret to feel bad about the things you wish you didn't do. And then you can just tell your mom now. You can, you could tell your mom, like for instances, if you were sorry about all those things, you can, you can say to her. "I am sorry about the times I hit you or mean to you, or said mean things to you." You could tell her that. And that that, that… So like I said, I'm, kind of, beginning to give her things to say. I said you could tell her that, you could say, "I'm sorry. Didn't mean to do it or that." And she shakes her head, no. So now I'm, kind of, oh! Now where do I go? No? You'll feel better. No. Are you afraid if you said it, she'll mad at you? Okay, so again, she says no, rather than talk her out of it. Again, I don't understand why she wouldn't want to say that to her mom. So I asked… I try… I explore that. Again that's, sort of, my common theme, when somebody says something that I don't understand or doesn't make sense to me, I want to explore it, I want to figure out what's driving it, or what's underneath the behavior. And so I throw in an idea, perhaps, are you worried that if you did that your mom would be angry at you? And she says yes. She shakes her head yes. And… Now that she doesn't want to bring up a sore subject because she's convinced her mom is still angry about. Oh! No. She said she wouldn't be. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You know what? Your mom might even… You know what, Michaela? Your mom might even like to hear those things. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Hmm… You can go on. 

00:10:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Could you, could you tell her that? I'm just, kind of, sorry about those things. No? That's pretty clear. Before you? 

00:10:40
MICHAELA No. 

00:10:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No? So, you know, I'll ask a child, can you do this? If that's too difficult as it is here then, sort of, my next step would be, oh, okay, what I… Can I do it for you? But in this case, no, not a good idea either. She doesn't want me to do that. 

00:11:00
MICHAELA I'll tell her later. 

00:11:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! You… So again, I want her to. She says, no. I say, "Can I tell her no?" So again what I'm realizing is, oh, you know what? Asking her these questions, I think, I'm just gonna get no as an answer. So I turned it into a umm… Still a question, but more of a statement which is, oh! Well, then who is gonna tell her?" All right? Which, sort of, begs the question, right? That you're going to tell her. And what she says, "Me, later." Okay. So that's it. That's… 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN She's leaving you at (inaudible ). 

00:11:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Yeah. Which is fine, you know, that's fine with me, you know. Some of us… They are happy that things work out. So it's like, "Okay. Me, later." Umm… that's great and, umm… obsessive that I am, I then follow that up with… Well, you'll see. Who's gonna tell her then? 

00:11:55
MICHAELA I'll tell her later. 

00:11:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you'll tell her later? Well, okay. You can tell her later. But when, when is later, when you mean later? 

00:12:00
MICHAELA When we're shopping. 

00:12:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! When you're shopping? You're going to shopping after you leave here? Really? Where? 

00:12:10
MICHAELA Target and Cole. 

00:12:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Huh! So that's when you are… You're gonna tell her those things. That you're sorry about the times you hit her. Now what did you hear except for a little cheating? She says she is gonna tell her later, when? When they go shopping. They're going shopping after they leave at Targets and Cole. I said, "Oh! So that's when you'll tell her." That's… and now I say all the things that I would have said, if she said, "Yes, you can speak for me." I say, "Oh! You're gonna…" Anyway you'll hear it. Basically go through the things that she's gonna tell her mom when you're shopping. (inaudible ), yeah. Say if that she liked to hear that. And I bet you would feel better too, telling your mommy, you feel bad about those things you did. And you, you're really… you know, you're hardly ever now, doing those things a year ago. A year ago, those were things that happened, I don't know, everyday, more than once a day. And now they hardly ever happen. Isn't that… Isn't that true, Michaela? Yeah. They hardly ever happen. You're really… You're getting so much stronger in your heart. And the hurts… Well, the hurts and (inaudible ) to your heart, they're healing. And so even now you can think about Ann and it's not, not as bad as it used to be. What's there? Oh! You don't know how to put your ring. Where did you get that one? 

00:13:50
MICHAELA At Claire's. 

00:13:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN At Claire's? So what I want to do now, we've just had this difficult, you know, for her, difficult for her deep conversation. Now I want to move out of that, lighten it a little bit. And, you know, we might come back to it later, but again that ebb and flow. So what I do is umm… Well, I, I comment on her ring. You'll see we talk a little bit about jewelry. Umm… I make a joke about her blowing her nose. I said you have to be careful. You'll, you'll hear. Careful, I don't want to umm… blow your brains out of your ears. 

00:14:30
MICHAELA I blew my brains out before. It don't hurt. 

00:14:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You don't want to do that. It's hard to get them back in your ears then. Who got you the ring? 

00:14:40
MICHAELA My daddy. 

00:14:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Your daddy? Of course, those are nice, plus he… So I'll do that with kids. You know, if they have something, "Well, that's really pretty, you know, nice pretty bangles or earrings or blouse or shoes. Where did you get it? And then who got it for you?" And most of the time, of course it's, it's the parent. It's just a way indirectly to, umm… you know, to make a connection and to point out that the parent does do things that are caring without having to say, "Oh! But your mom or dad, they do all these things for you." All right, that's coming from the child, not from me or the, or the mom. You get your earrings there, too? 

00:15:15
MICHAELA Yes, I did. And these, too. 

00:15:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And the bangles. That's what you call them, bangles? 

00:15:20
MICHAELA Yes. 

00:15:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Oh, now this is a… it gives you a better picture of Michaela. She's, as I mentioned, uh, developmentally delayed, lower IQ. She's, she is very concrete. And that… So it's a nice clip, I think because sometimes, umm… people will think, "Well, this is a great treatment, if you have a very, very articulate child." But what about a kid who isn't? And I think, you'll see here that, umm… you don't need to be very, umm… have a huge vocabulary. She's very concrete, but everything comes through very clearly. 

00:16:00
MICHAELA Well, my sister didn't go to camp, umm… last summer we had a picnic, a different time. 

00:16:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN See, 'cause I asked her, how are things different this year than last year? I don't… I'm not really asking about the picnics, I'm asking about her life. But I wasn't clear about it. So she's responding in the way that makes sense to her. 

00:16:20
MICHAELA This summer we had, umm… a 4th of July party. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN And a Labor day party? 

00:16:30
MICHAELA Yeah. But then, well, we did have a 4th of July party. And I baked a cake. It was chocolate. What was it, white? Rose. And I put, I, I put, you know, frosting on. And I put blueberries for the stars and strawberries for the stripes. 

00:16:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! Very nice. 

00:17:00
MICHAELA Yeah (inaudible ). 

00:17:01
UNKNOWN We picked blueberries? 

00:17:01
MICHAELA Oh, we picked blueberries this summer. I am going to Aunt Mary's, this summer. 

00:17:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You didn't go last summer? 

00:17:10
MICHAELA I'm going for a week. 

00:17:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! Is that, is that good? 

00:17:15
MICHAELA Yeah. 

00:17:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What do you like about Aunt Mary? 

00:17:15
MICHAELA Well, there is always Steven, you know, the cousin. And there is (inaudible ) and there is Subway. And there's a lot of things. Subway! 

00:17:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Now here is a hard question. How do you think, you are different this summer compared to last summer? 

00:17:40
MICHAELA Well, I'm older this summer. 

00:17:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. What else? How, how do you think, you are either acting different or feeling different or being different to people… 

00:17:45
MICHAELA I'm being a lot better. 

00:17:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And what is better? 

00:17:50
MICHAELA Well, I'm behaving better. 

00:17:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What behaving do you mean? 

00:17:55
MICHAELA Well, I'm acting good. 

00:17:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So what is it that you're doing or not doing? 

00:18:00
MICHAELA I'm not hitting as much. 

00:18:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! So when was the last time when you actually did hit? Do you know? Can you remember? Was it today? Was it, uh, this weekend? No. Was it the weekend before? 

00:18:20
MICHAELA Well, it's probably last week. 

00:18:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Do you think it was like just one week ago? 

00:18:30
MICHAELA It was like early in the week, one week ago. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN May be you… Do you never pick up (inaudible ). 

00:18:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! 

00:18:40
MICHAELA I hit her, like, uh, Tuesday. 

00:18:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh. But your mom, it's been? 

00:18:50
MICHAELA A longer time. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Wow! Well, that's… 

00:18:50
MICHAELA Three weeks. 

00:18:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Three? 'Cause… So last, last summer, how… I mean, about how often do you think you were hitting your mom last summer? 

00:19:00
MICHAELA Well, once a week. Once or twice a week. 

00:19:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Is it twice a week? Does it sound right? You think more or less? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Well, a little more often I think. 

00:19:05
MICHAELA Yeah. Every other day. 

00:19:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Every other day. 

00:19:10
MICHAELA Belly! Rub my belly, mummy. 

00:19:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So that's a big change, Michaela. Going from every other day, which in three weeks… So it's just really sweet, you know. She, she is, you can see, she's able to talk about some things that at a different point in treatment, or for another child could be very dysregulating, very ashaming. You used to hit your mom every other day. Umm… even though, she's not now, she can talk about that. You know, she, she does something to try to, uh, uh, get some experience, I guess. Or to try to evoke that, it really is okay, mom, right? She says, "Belly! Rub my belly." Right? You know, do you really love me? Can you… you know. And her mom, yeah, reaches over, pats her belly, pulls her shirts down. Umm… 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:20:01
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Does she see? No. You should disregu… by dis… When I use the term dysregulation, what I mean is, when the child or adult or person is dissociated, they're inarticulate. They're not, sort of, in the here and now, relating in the here and now. She's in the here and now. She's relating. She's acting in a relatively immature way, but that's really where she's developmentally. But she's coherent. She's responding to me and her mother. She's trying to engage her mother. Umm… I don't see her as dysregulated, I see her as just being a… 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible )see how she's moving around and (inaudible ), you know. And saying this uncomfortable, or having a hard time with something that was going on… 

00:20:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, I think, she's, kind of enjoying us. I think, she's sort of saying to me this is a boring topic. Uh, I know, I used to do this stuff, I don't do it anymore. I'm… It's almost, umm… uh, my experience was that it's like, uh-huh, you know, we can talk about this. But it doesn't have the same heavy emotional tone it had in the past about. In other words, I don't believe at this point, when she talks about the things she does. She feels, "I'm a bad kid because of what I did." I think she has enough understanding of herself and her relationship with her mom that she recognizes she did those things. But that doesn't make her bad. So that's, kind of, how I see it. And, and almost all, like a, like a younger kid, I mean, younger kids do have trouble sitting still. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) she is more likely a child she's not. You said she's more like a (inaudible ). 

00:21:32
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:21:32
UNKNOWN But she's probably functioning an age of (inaudible ). 

00:21:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… Much… Yeah. Yeah, different… 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN They don't sit still (inaudible ). 

00:21:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right, right. I mean, I, I, you develop me. I don't remember exactly where she fell on some of the scales we used. But it really was close to probably six, somewhere in that range. And probably not off by more than, may be a couple of years either way. So that's, kind of, just, how she is. And she's still relating. So I don't… You know, it doesn't… I don't think much of it. 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:22:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! I'm just here, I'm sitting… Well, you can't see me. Well, duh! Right? That's why you asked. But I'm sitting like, right over here. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:22:16
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah. I'm sitting right over here. I, I, umm… when I, when I have my… The way I have my office setup, I, I don't want the camera lens out too big because it's hard to see facial expressions. And I guess I'm more interested in the parents and kid than me. So I focus on the couch, as opposed to, you know, bringing out just a little bit to, umm… to include me in the picture. So, but yeah, I'm… just like, right, right off camera. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:22:46
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Ah… Yes. Yes. 

00:22:46
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) …safe to make an safe environment (inaudible ). 

00:23:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I have no reason to discourage that. Well, you know, if she's feeling comfortable, she's articulate, she's relating, she's, sort of, staying engaged in what we're doing. So if she has to move around or fidget, you know, she has sensory issues that, you know, could be present as well. Umm… that's all fine. Yes, if she feels comfortable. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:23:21
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Yeah. And again, that… 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:23:26
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And that would reflect my… That would reflect my need. This is about them and maintaining a relationship, not about decorum or, you know, that, sort of, thing. I mean, I, and I like her, I'm enjoying her. I think, I, you know, I think what she's doing is cute. I, I like what she's doing. So I don't, I. I don't know why I would want to change it. Okay, she's a nice kid, has a nice mom, they're having a good time. Umm… I'm having a good time. What's not to like about it? Okay. You like, (inaudible ) would be, like, in three weeks, that would be like between 10, 12 times to zero in three weeks. That's a big change. So how did you do that? How're you doing that? Like what… How is it that you're not, umm… hitting? 

00:24:15
MICHAELA Last summer, I didn't have as much counseling. 

00:24:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:24:20
MICHAELA And, and, uh, I didn't feel like is someone who… 

00:24:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She says, well, she says, umm… I can feel someone loves me. You know, how, how do you make this different, her answer is, I can feel someone loves me. 

00:24:30
MICHAELA And now I know someone loves me. 

00:24:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Wow! That's a huge difference. So now you know somebody loves you. 

00:24:35
MICHAELA Yes. 

00:24:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Who? Who do you know loves you? 

00:24:40
MICHAELA Her and daddy. 

00:24:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Ah! 

00:24:45
MICHAELA And my sister, and my doggy, and my fish. 

00:24:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And you didn't feel that way last summer. 

00:24:50
MICHAELA No, because I didn't have a fish. 

00:24:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! 

00:24:50
MICHAELA Yeah, I did have 2 kittens. My kittens got (inaudible ) and (inaudible ), whatever that means. 

00:25:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. So it can't have babies. 

00:25:00
MICHAELA Yeah. 

00:25:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So last summer, you didn't, you didn't really feel that anybody loved you and now you do. What a big change! That's a really big… And so that makes you feel when you get angry, instead of… so what do you do instead of hitting, when you get angry, like at your mom and your dad? 

00:25:20
MICHAELA I try to get them to hug me before I get angry. 

00:25:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! So, okay, so you heard that. So again, very interesting, her… What made the difference is, in the past, she sometimes thought people loved her. But now she knows people love her, right? Difference between thinking and, and feeling. And that's makes the difference. And the other thing, she's just getting into here is, umm… uh, uh, the dynamic that seem to go on, in the past is, she would get agitated about something. Something would provoke her, something the parents did or didn't do. She'd start to get agitated. The mom, who earlier, you know, before she came into treatment would then start to feel scared of her daughter, like she doesn't want to be hit or bit or punched. And the kid's big and can really hurt her. Would do what? She'd begin to withdraw, right? Which only added gasoline to the fire. And once they could figure that out, then what the mom could do is when she began to sense her daughter getting agitated, she would just go over and give her a hug. And now it's at the point where when Michaela recognizes she's getting agitated, now she can also ask her mom for a hug or go to give her mom a hug. Okay. So she's learning. Again, if you think about what we talked about in the morning. First, the mother would regulate her daughter's emotions and behavior. And then they did it together. And now Michaela has internalized that and is beginning to do that on her own, okay? First, you do it for them, then with them. Then they can do it on their own. And that's, that's exactly what you're seeing here. And her ability to reflect on that and recognize that is, again, for her, her pretty, pretty reasonably well developed. Okay. Let's see what else she says. 

00:27:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And then when you do because everybody gets angry about things. I mean, things happen that are bothersome or, or irritating. So what, what do you do now when something happens? Your mom says or does something that you just don't like. What do you do now instead of hit? 

00:27:25
MICHAELA I don't slam doors. 

00:27:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. But what do you do instead? 

00:27:30
MICHAELA I go play in my room. 

00:27:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You play in your room. 

00:27:30
MICHAELA Or I go to sleep. 

00:27:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! 

00:27:35
MICHAELA Sometimes I take a big, long nap, right? 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Sometimes. 

00:27:40
MICHAELA More than 2 hours. 

00:27:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Mm-hmm. Does that help you not harm? 

00:27:45
MICHAELA Yeah, it helps me to forget about it. When I'm asleep, I don't know what's going on. 

00:27:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN But what about something just bothers you, your mom says or does something. And you still don't like it and you're irritated by. What, what do you do now? You know, not a big thing. But just, you know, you just don't like what she… you know, you want, you said, "Let's do this." And just known we can't do that now. Okay, umm… Not happening. Okay. Umm… let's just take a few minutes to, umm… If you've get questions or comments. I mean, uh, we could have that the lights, the light. Umm… about Michaela, and then we can, kind of, look at the next clip. Yes. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN It's not specifically about the camera behind him. You know, she is… 9 (inaudible ). But occasionally, I call the parents… (inaudible ). 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Earlier I talked about how in those, fir… Because it was the morning, I, I talked about how in that that fir… the first meeting with the parents, how often I talk with them about, you know, if I say, if I see, you're saying or doing something that isn't helpful, can I interrupt you? So, first, there's that in mind. Second of all, we, we've met ahead of time, umm… for a couple of sessions without even the child. Each session begins with me meeting with them. So, you know, I'm able to talk with them, get a sense of them. Umm… if I think, that's gonna be an issue, I may just address that directly before it happens, you know. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, (inaudible ). 

00:29:26
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So often… Yeah. So often what I'll say in the, in the early part is, you know, listen when you're in there, umm… yeah, be yourself, don't worry. My job is to manage the session. You be the mom or you be the dad, don't worry about what happens, don't worry about what your kid says or does or reacts. You know, just… We're interested in the relationships here. Because again, we've had a bunch of talk about, we're focusing on relationships. Not behavior, what's causing behavior? It's about relationships. It's about connections not compliance. So we've had all of this, sort of, been talked about. So if even despite that, the parents start, so I would say, oh! Could you, could you held on to that thought for a minute. You know, and again we've had that discussion there. Okay? But, but, we've… I've done a lot of this work ahead of time with the parents about all of these issues, connections, not compliance, relationships, what's driving behavior not behavior. That's what makes this treatment different than some other treatments. Right? So they're primed in that regard. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN So the key part of my problem is that (inaudible ). And I've always tried to umm… (inaudible ). 

00:30:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, I wouldn't disagree with that, so for instance, (inaudible ) some cookies, I wouldn't bring them in. What I would say is, you know, mom looks like, umm… you know, your son might need a break now. And I was thinking we would take a break, umm… (inaudible ) is he allergic chocolates or peanuts or anything like that? No. Oh, okay, because I was thinking may be I could bring in some cookies with that… Oh, sure, bring those in. Okay, great. I'll go get them. But, umm… even if the child does something that's really unacceptable behavior, like the example I gave of the boy wiping the blood on my sleeve. We can deal with the behavior later. I want to know what's driving the behavior. I want to address that, not the behavior. Because it's the, sort of, funny example I gave earlier. Umm… it really matters if you're asking where did I come from? Whether you're asking about babies or where Grandma lives, right? So we want to address what's driving the behavior, not the surface symptom. Okay. So I want to get… And then they can deal with behavior. I met with my, with my two older kids, well, actually, my younger one, too. One of the most effective things I could do is, if they did something, uh, I didn't like or my wife didn't like, is to say, "You know, we're not happy about that. Umm… tomorrow for breakfast, we'll, uh, you know, I want to think about it. I'll let you know what's, what's gonna happen." And he'll go, "What, what Dad?" "I don't know. I want to think about it," you know. And then what happens is, of course, they spend the whole night thinking about it. And then in the morning, if it's just, you know, I want you to do this or that, the other type, "Oh is that it? Okay." So instead of arguing about whatever the consequences… 'cause often they produce disaster scenarios. It's like, oh, if that's all you're wanting me to do. I can do that. Okay. Any other questions? About Michaela, the family? You're not sure. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN Well, I don't want to (inaudible ). But I, I (inaudible ). And there is no connection between mom and Michaela looking at each other saying (inaudible ). 

00:33:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It certainly can be. (inaudible ) comes important because in her case… 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:33:57
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 'Cause in her case, it was… just, I think, I say, kind of, this is a topic that's somewhat boring, everything's okay, why do we have to talk about it. It's just not a big deal. There was no lot of, as I said, you know, shame or, or embarrassment, uh, regarding that. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN While we're talking about how far you've come in an year (inaudible ). 

00:34:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Umm… No, it was about, it was about how she used to hit her mom. There is just not a lot of shame or embarrassment tied to that. She, she did that. She can talk about it. It doesn't have a lot of emotional baggage tied to it because she's really worked that through in a way and it doesn't represent the fact that she's a bad kid. It represents, you know, her narrative is who represents the fact that she had a very difficult early few years and, umm… has some, has and had, had some strong feelings about her birth mom for what she did. And those have to do with her birth mom, not, uh, this mom. Okay. What I'm gonna show you now is, umm… role-play. Umm… It's with a… I think she is a six years old, therapeutic foster mom, she's gonna be adopting the girl. We've done this role-play probably four or five times. So it's not the first time. It's become almost like a favorite bedtime story for her. She knows the whole thing. She tells me what to do. You'll see we do the role-play. Umm… and I want you to see that and you'll see what happens. Umm… we talk about it afterwards. That's the reflective piece. Then what we move into, for the first time, what I call the magic wand, where I come back in as her birth mom. But, kind of, I describe it to her as being nice. And say all the things we would wish her birth mom would be able to say to her. And then we talk about it and we'll see the impact it has. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
The discussion begins here after having done a role-play in which Dr. Becker Weidman played the birth mother as she was experienced by the child. 

00:35:55
In this next section, we discuss that role-play and then move into doing the "magic wand" role-play in which the birth mother is 'nice' and able to apologize for the things she did. 

00:35:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, (inaudible), who was that lady I saw leaving? I saw, I saw some lady leaving, who was she? 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN She was, she was mom Kelly. 

00:36:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That was mommy Kelly? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What was she doing here? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN She was holding me. 

00:36:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She was trying to hold you? 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Hurt me! 

00:36:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She was trying to hurt you? 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! And what happened? 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN She (inaudible ). She made her go away. 

00:36:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She did? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Boy! That's good. She really was trying to hurt you? Boy, you think she would have hurt you? 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN I'll play again. Let's play again. 

00:36:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You like to play that again. You like telling her to leave and go? 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You like that. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Can we play again? 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Couldn't force her now, I think. 

00:36:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, well, who… 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:36:47
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Who's gonna, who makes her go? 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN She and me. 

00:36:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I think mommy does. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Please, can I play it again? 

00:36:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What do you want to… What do you want to… I think, I can go catch her and have her come back. But will you, this time, may be there are things you would like to ask her or say to her? 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN What would you like to ask her? 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Just go away. 

00:37:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What would you like to tell… Hey, I have an idea. I have a good idea, I think. I can go, have her come back. But this time, instead of being mean and trying to hurt you, this time, she came, I can make her come back and for just five minutes, she can talk to you. And be nice and talk to you in a nice way. And then you could ask her questions, if you wanted to ask her questions. What do you think about that? She won't be mean this time. I'll have her comeback for just five minutes. And I can, with magic, make her be just a nice person for five minutes. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:38:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:38:10
[sil.] 

00:38:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Hello, (inaudible ), I'm your first mommy, mommy Kelly. And I came back. I came back because I heard you wanted to ask me some things. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN What're you gonna ask her? 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) feel bad? 

00:38:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Why was I bad? Why was I mean? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, you know, I wasn't raised the right way. And I just didn't… 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Oh, God.(ph) 

00:38:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no. My mummy didn't raise me the right way and I didn't know how to take care of a little baby or a little girl. I didn't know the right way to take care of you. And, and I, I didn't know how to take care of you and all the things that you did that little babies do, I didn't know what to do. And so I thought you're bad, but you weren't bad. I just didn't know how to take care of you. I wasn't very happy. And I wasn't happy and I blamed you. But it wasn't your fault. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN So was it your fault? 

00:39:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN See, so I say it wasn't your fault and she says, "Oh! Was it your fault?" So that's, that's an important piece of the, umm… the, what I call this reparative role-play as the parent. You know, where the person playing the parent acknowledges that, you know, it really wasn't your fault. It was the things I did, but it wasn't your fault. And that's important… that's very powerful for kids to hear. I wasn't very happy. And I couldn't think about all the things that were making me unhappy. So instead of thinking about what was making me unhappy, I blamed you. But I should've done that. I'm sorry I did that, (inaudible ). I lost my temper with you sometimes. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry that I, I'm sorry that I scared you, when I hit you. You remember when I broke the TV? Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I shouldn't have done that. That wasn't your fault. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:41:03
UNKNOWN Why you left? 

00:41:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Why have I left? 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Because I just couldn't, I couldn't take care of you. And I wasn't being a good mommy. And I just wanted to do the things I wanted to do. I didn't know how to take care of a little girl. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. All I wanted to do was do the things I wanted to do. And that's not what a mommy is supposed to do. Mommies are supposed to think about their children first. I didn't do that. I wasn't a very good mommy for you. And I'm sorry about … 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN You was. 

00:41:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I was? 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm… 

00:41:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, there is one thing, there's one thing I know I can do now, that would be a good mommy thing. Do you know what that is? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Mm… 

00:41:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The one thing I'd like to do now. And I think, I think would be a good mommy thing is I would like you to let mommy, this mommy Laura(ph). I would like you to let her be your mommy. I think that would be a good thing. I think the best thing, I could do is say to you, I want you let her be you mommy. And I want you to be her little girl. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:42:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You're welcome. Good bye,(inaudible ). 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:42:36
UNKNOWN Bye! 

00:42:36
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Bye, bye. 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN Yes, she said sorry and said you can you're could be my mommy now. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN She said sorry and that made you feel better? 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. And that, you know, that I can be your daughter. 

00:43:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Now, what she says is, uh, "You know, that she said sorry and that I can be your daughter." And, and, and listen to the tape, that was one of the clues that she really, umm… was integrating this in her because I didn't use the word daughter. I said, be her little girl, right? But she, she's putting this now into her own words and that's again a small clue, but a clue that this, this is really being integrated for her. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN You think she'll let you be my daughter? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Does that make you feel better? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Ah! So what do you think? 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN What do you think? (inaudible ) be forwarding this adoption (inaudible ). 

00:43:44
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Yes. (inaudible ). 

00:43:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And so now we'll do the debriefing. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Mommy Kelly. 

00:43:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What did she tell you? What did she say? Tell me what happened. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN I can be her daughter. 

00:43:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Really? 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She said, she wants you to be her daughter? 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN But tell him what she said that made the difference. What did she tell you? She was… 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Thanks for putting, you know, a magic spell on her. 

00:44:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So again, it's like it really happened. Thank you. She is thanking me for putting the magic spell on her birth mom. So her birth mom could say this thing that freed her up. You can be her daughter. All right. It's just, it's, it's, uh, every, every time I watch this or the other, uh, role-plays, it's just, it's amazing how powerful it is. It's as if it actually happened. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN So what did she tell you? She was what? 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN She was nice. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN She was what, for the mean things? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Sorry. 

00:44:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN She was sorry for all those mean things she did. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh! I'm so glad. I'm so glad she was sorry about that. And she wants you to be mommy's little girl? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's nice. Is that what you want? 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN I'll let her go away without me. 

00:45:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN That's what you want to be? You want to be mommy's little girl. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN She is so nice. (inaudible ) Can you bring me a glass of hot chocolate? 

00:45:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Who do you think? Okay. She, uh, got to me confused with… you can turn the lights on now. She got me confused with a friend (inaudible ), I guess. Umm…Well, actually we often ended sessions with, umm… mom giving her hot cocoa in, like, a glass or a sippy cup or something like that. So that's what she's, sort of, reflecting on. Uh, comments? Questions, about the whole thing or especially the, this magic wand piece, this reparative, uh, reparative role-play? Yeah. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN now (inaudible). 

00:45:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, I, uh, umm… again, I didn't give her any scripts or words or things, like you said, be yourself, yeah. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:46:11
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. But… Yeah. Umm… Yeah, but I'd worked with her, uh, well, with like a lot of parents to help her understand her child because this is a kid who like once, they went roller skating. And she kicked her mom in the face with roller skates. And, you know, I mean she is a very aggressive, violent kid. Beat up her son, who, her birth son, who is, umm… five years older than her. Umm… But yes, I did a fair amount of work helping her understand her child, figure out what's motivating the behavior. And then figure out ways to address it, so yeah. And then the mom became obviously pretty insightful and very sensitive. Her motivation was all good. She wanted to be this kid's mother. She wants to be the best mother she could. She wants to help this kid. And so I think with any parent… and I think most parents feel that way. So as, as therapists, if we can always look for that and somehow find that in there, even in parents who are having a really, really hard time, if we can get to that piece and recognize that their intentions are to be a good dad or a good mom, umm… then we can help them do that. Sometimes takes longer than other times but that's the piece where we will have to do zero in on. Other comments, questions? Yeah. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN So the magic wand part, where the mommy comes in and said she is sorry, or really, either part, you would, umm… repeat that as, as many times as the child asks you to do so or… I mean, obviously, the magic isn't just gonna be at one session. 

00:47:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) when you hear it over and over. 

00:47:47
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Actually, it's interesting. Reparative role play, we usually just do once. Yeah, the, the trauma reenactments, we often do again and again to, sort of, raise the intensity and bring in other issues. But I find, once we have done, again, this is just my experience, the reparative role-play, we do that once and that seems to be fine, that they're, kind of, done. I think, it frees the parent or the child to, to, to be able, to be the child of the family. Let them be their mom and dad. And also care about their birth parents, who are… they're not monsters. They're flawed individuals and often, again in terms of what I talked about earlier shades of gray, they often have a lot of negative memories but also some positive memories. And it frees them up to… It's not either or. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Can I add something to that there? 

00:48:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, yeah. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN In my experiences, that some kids have a harder time with the trauma piece and other kids have a harder time with the repair, at the end piece. Yeah, some kids are able to be angry that they can't forgive or they can't grieve because the issue about grieving the loss of a parent. When you're angry you don't face the loss. And there is always loss there. You know, you know, even if it is the idealized parent, you've lost something when you are a baby, you never get again. So some kids, that second piece is harder for them and with those kids I end up repeating that, the second piece. 

00:49:10
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good point. Thank you. Ah! Yes. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN I really appreciate the way you did with the (inaudible ) first parent that you played for reason and help explain in a logical way, you know, what was going on with her head, I mean, she, she was good at the best she could was(inaudible ). 

00:49:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah and it gets to (inaudible ). Parents have good intentions. What they do with those intentions is another story. But parents have good intentions and I'm sure that, although I'd never met, I'm sure she didn't intend to abuse her child and traumatize her child and have her child removed. Umm… That's what happened but I'm sure that, I believe that couldn't have been her intention. So there had to be something there. And, and again, it's consistent with this approach that there's a reason for behavior and the narrative is very important. The narrative helps us understand the why. It make… it helps us make sense of the experience and, you know, as we said earlier, often what makes a traumatic event traumatic is the meaning we ascribe to it, more so than the actual objective factors. So the meaning is important. Other? Yes. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) and you said to her, I'm sorry, (inaudible ). You know, she almost said, almost gave her permission to (inaudible ) (inaudible ). 

00:50:45
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, I didn't do, I figured exactly but I didn't… It wasn't a good… Or it didn't do, uh, things the right way or something like that. Yeah, and then, right, said, and for me, that, uh, in doing that, I knew the things I wanted to work into this, however came out is first of all, I'm sorry about what I did. My fault, not your fault. And I want you to be her daughter and let her be your mommy. So that seemed like, when, when it went happened, that was a great segue. Oh, I can think of one thing that would be, you know, like a good mommy thing and led to that. Yeah. And again I think its… 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:51:22
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:51:26
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, I think, what it, in our country, I think what it represented is a degree of integration that she could recognize, her mommy did terrible things. Frightened her terribly, was, was angry and abusive, smashed her against the wall. And she also had some good memories and had some fun with her mom and had some joyful occasions. So the fact that she could hold both of those, speaks to, you know, again, uh, this is why you do this toward the middle or end of treatment not at the beginning, speaks to a reasonably high level of integration that you can contain both of those experiences and memories at the same time. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN I think it's also a response to the, mom saying that, I'm sorry. The kid… when she says, I'm sorry. I was a bad mommy. The kid is saying, "You're not." She's really saying, "I forgive you." And when many times when a parent in the therapy says, "I'm sorry. I, I hurt you about that." And the kid says," It wasn't that bad." That, sort of, like, don't hurt too much because you forgive me… I mean, if you're sorry, then I could, I can let it go. 

00:52:30
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. Yes. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:52:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN (inaudible ) Umm… Again I just… that, that given the role-play, I just, I don't see how that even would have happened. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:53:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Oh, you mean the magic wand part. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN It's being nice. Okay. Got it. Okay. I, I misunderstood. I'm sorry. Yeah, in that piece, umm… I would have said, you know, probably like Dan suggested, I would have interpreted that as a, you know, I'm glad you can forgive me. Umm… I really can't take care of you. I wish I could have. I really would like you to… You know, again, I repeat the same thing. I want you to be a part of this family. I wish I could have been a different mommy to you. You deserved a better mommy and I'm sorry that I couldn't be it. So that how I, you know, that's how I would, would probably address it. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN We got two minutes. 

00:53:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yes. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:53:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN … kids certainly in treatment say, you know, I want to go back to my mom and… But, and, you know, we deal with that or I don't like, you know, because of what you said. Now I'm gonna go back to my other foster home or whatever is that that comes up there. I haven't had it occur in a role-play or psycho dramatic reenactment. But certainly that all… that… not a lot, but it come… comes up really frequently in treatment, you know. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN The role play is not a casual thing you do. Yeah, I mean, that's the most powerful intervention you're probably going to do in the whole course of therapy. So you really prepare the kid, make sure it's gonna be successful or… So if I had any doubts about that, it's coming out and it'll be worked through in smaller bits that. So it never gets that intense or else you're traumatizing a child. 

00:54:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN And it, it is the most powerful, uh, invariably at the end of treatment, when we talk about what was it like for you? What do you remember? What was most important for you, invariably kids at some point bring up when my birth mom or my birth dad said, when they came back and we did that, you know, role-play, that is something they really have. And parents do often as well. 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:55:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Always? Not always. It's… Umm… I, I, I pretty much always, don't always do stuff. Umm… So… Umm… But every often, yeah, very often. Sometimes it's not necessary. Umm… Sometimes, you know, it just may take a long time to get there. But very frequently, I do, because it is, it is such an integrating, umm… type of intervention. But everybody has to be ready. The child and the parents, both, all three of them have to really be ready for it, emotionally. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Well, as we got one more minute. So I think, I think, uh, Arthur and I would like to thank you for being here. 

00:55:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN And hope you know that this is, sort of, a thumbnail sketch of DDP. (inaudible ) can't be sent in one day. Uh, we used to do training the last hours as you mentioned or what we mentioned like the certification process has 56 hours of training before. Well, you can start the certification week after 28 but you need to hold 56 hours rather than six hours like today. But that's this is core of DDP, the overall principle. So hope you're finding it interesting. And if you want to, uh, continue to explore, feel free to email either of us or any members of the board of DDPI, which there is now a website. So thanks again and… 

00:56:15
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. 

00:56:15
DAN HUGHES Thank you all. Have a good evening.
