RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, welcome to this Networker webcast series, helping parents today. My name is Rich Simon, I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker, I'm your host for this series. So what we're doing in this Networker series is looking at the range of issues, the particular, the challenges, some of the most pressing challenges for 21st century parents and today we're going to focus on, uh, an issue that in recent years has gotten an enormous amount of attention in the press and there's been some particularly dramatic stories that have been in the newspapers and in the news about bullying and sometimes with fatal consequences of bullying. And we're very fortunate today to have, uh, with us, one of, uhm, somebody I consider to be one of the real innovative thinkers and leading experts on this whole area of bullying and what we can do about it. Stan Davis, coming to us from Maine. Stan? Welcome. 

00:01:10
STAN DAVIS Glad to be here. 

00:01:15
RICH SIMON So, uhm, one of the, it seems first of all, it just seems as if there's a lot of press coverage, a lot of stories about bullying and this phenomenon particularly of cyber bullying. Before we move into the, the details and we're going to be getting at some of these, the nuts and bolts issues for therapists in practice in regard to bullying, let's take the big, the big picture. Is there any evidence that the incidents of bullying has really increased in recent years? 

00:01:50
STAN DAVIS Well it depends on the kind of behavior you're looking at. One of the difficulties is the word, which includes so many categories of behavior done in so many different ways. David Finklehorn's work at the university of New Hampshire says pretty clearly that there's been a reduction in physical aggression overall among kids in this country. So the kids are less likely to be hit or physically threatened at school. We've seen either an increase of or an increase in awareness about, name-calling and exclusion. Both of those categories. And it's very, of course it's very difficult to tell whether there's been more of these things or whether we're looking at them more. But the work I've been doing with Cherise Nixon says between the two, about a fourth of kids have experienced negative actions by peers that are possibly, possibly could harm them within the last month, two or three times or more. So that's a substantial number of kids. As to cyber bullying of course, it's increased because there wasn't the technological opportunity before, if you don't count, uh, uh, prank phone calling, which was significant before we invented, uh, caller I-D. But certainly a whole other cluster of behaviors has sprung up and it's been fueled partly by this saturation of media modeling, both in reality T-V and the news, of mean behavior. So, there's been an increase in a variety of things, the cyber bullying specifically and the amount and intensity of modeling. 

00:03:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so as we move into this, let's just give people a little sense of your background. You start off in community work in model cities programs, you've worked as a school councilor, you were, uh, uh, influenced by family systems. So, uh, when you began to work fulltime as a school councilor, you took your systems perspective and began to look at school systems in a, from that viewpoint. What stood out for you about that firsthand experience of schools and particularly in, in relationship to what you saw as this, uh, the attitude in schools about bullying and this I guess, is about 20 years ago, what we're talking about. 

00:04:05
STAN DAVIS Yeah, well, uh, a little further back when I was consulting in schools, the therapist, it seemed like a lot of stuff hadn't changed since I was a kid in the 50's. But still the assumptions that said if a kid was mistreated, that kid must somehow have earned that or failed to stand up to someone else or must be in some way bringing that on themselves, which is a very 50's and earlier perspective. Why haven't you told them off, why haven't you punched them out, why haven't you stood up to them, etcetera. Still, we see right through from the 16th century, the idea that tattling, meaning asking an adult for help about a real situation, is sometimes wrong depending on your motivation. It's just really hard to tell, you know, someone robs my house, and I want them to be, uh, consequenced by the culture so they won't do it again, the police don't say are you just trying to hurt somebody by reporting this, or get someone in trouble. But we continue to teach kids that somehow it could be wrong to tell an adult something they're concerned about. So those two things are still there and the other thing that's there is a carryover from the war on drugs and a number of other efforts to change youth behavior, is this, I think, mistaken idea, that if someone who is a particularly good speaker gets up in front of a group of kids and says A, B and C behaviors are wrong and can do harm, cut it out, that kids will go, you know, what was I thinking. Now that I know that, I won't smoke or drink or use other drugs or whatever else. So we had all those ideas behind us and what we were just beginning to have, not until the 90's, was a consensus that you had to look at schools systemically. You had to look at the way in which adults treat kids in school as a model, you had to look at the way adults build connections with kids as a effort to build resiliency, you had to look at how people respond to reports and you more than anything else, had to look at the power that the extended peer group give kids who, who aggress. Are kids who are mean to other kids then supported by that, and doing that by their peers laughing or admiring and on the contrary, are kids who are hurt or excluded then also excluded by everyone else, or can we shift those things systemically so that other kids aren't encouraging the mean behavior and even more important, so that other kids aren't colluding with the exclusion of kids who are mistreated. And this is, this is arced right over to the research I'm doing now with Cherise Nixon, where of a whole variety of things done by self or adults or peers, kids who are mistreated said the best thing somebody can do for me is to sit with me at lunch and encourage me, is for a peer to sit with me at lunch and encourage me. So that becomes a systemic question. How do we increase the level of kindness, how do we increase peers willingness to reach out to kids who are on the outside socially, how do we increase the frequency of inclusive and supportive behavior? Because that turns out to be the, the thing that most reduced trauma for kids who were mistreated. So, that's been the arc, is to look at the school as a, as a large system and try to change norms and the values and the expectations within that system. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON So, so, there have been, again this is a story very much in the news and there's, there's been a fair amount of controversy about some programs, and things have been tried very punitive kinds of zero tolerance approaches to bullying. So, in terms of, uhm, moving into, uh, the more particulars about what you think works, what hasn't worked in these school programs around the country, in regard to this problem and then moving from that to what, what's, what seemed to be the most promising and effective approaches? 

00:08:05
STAN DAVIS Well I said the first thing, and that is that we move away from didactic scare tactics, uh, we're going to tell you what's wrong and then you'll do what approaches. To approach is to build a consensus among students by listening to them about how they feel about different behaviors, about whether behaviors are likely to harm, about what are safe and effective helping behaviors by peers and by adults and we get this largely from kids. We find that, for example, 90 percent of kids or more, in school surveys, will say that they don't want mistreatment of kids based on disability or mistreatment of kids based color or mistreatment based on, uh, sexual orientation. So that means those kids don't need a lecture about why you shouldn't do that, they need to learn how their peers feel and they need to work together to reduce these things. So the first shift is from didactic to consensus building, based on the positive values of kids. The second shift is to use what we know works in families and what we know works in behavior change, away from large consequences, difficulty, two difficulties with large consequences are they tend to increase the separation and disconnection between the institution and the kid. And secondly, the larger the consequences are, the more more adults will cheat on the system so that a kid who they think really doesn't deserve that won't get it. So large consequences force down consistency of reaction. To the idea that what we want to do behaviorally is more like boundary setting, where the boundary is the same school-wide for, to take that example, name-calling or other mistreatment based on sexual orientation then is something we're going to do something this, to discourage at every part of the school and every adult is going to work to discourage that and there's also going to be a systemic discouragement of that through possibly very, very tiny consequences that escalate a bit. And so that what kids get is once you walk into this building, there are things that are expected and we're going to connect with you and nurture you and also pull that line. Ron Tapple called that idea, oh that'll shut off, I'm sorry. Ron Tapple called that idea building a holding environment for kids, where we both have warmth and consistent boundary setting. And I think that's worked better. And the third thing as I've said, is to promote inclusive and supportive behavior by peers and, uh, just for example, the, the question, kids answer to the question do you feel part of your school, strongly predicted lower levels of trauma after being mistreated. If they, uh, said they were part of their school, they were much less likely to be traumatized by the same kind of mistreatment, than if they said they were not part of their school, in which, the trauma was higher. Well building a school culture in which kids include everybody, is something we can do in a very conscious way. So those are some of the things that have been more effective. 

00:11:05
RICH SIMON So one of the things, before we move on, that I, I find very interesting about your, your research and it's consistent with other, uh, studies about the nature of trauma, is that one of the things that can be very, uh, damaging is this equation between bullying and what, the automatic assumption that that's automatically traumatizing at a high degree with a child. Talk a bit, a little bit about that and why you think that's such a damaging concept. 

00:11:35
STAN DAVIS Well we found in our 3,000 kids who'd been mistreated, uh, frequently, that only half of them reported even moderate trauma. Half of them said, no it didn't even bother me that much and the real question is how those groups differentiate from each other. I really think in the quest to stop bullying, we've lost sight of efforts to build resiliency. And it's not that, it's not that that makes the mean behavior all right, the question about drinking and driving would be okay, we can only have airbags or drinking and driving enforcement programs, which is the reality of course is that we can have both and we've missed the airbag side of this, so we need to look at what we can do to help the young people become more resilient in themselves, through cognitive shield development and emotional awareness. But we also need to look at what kind of systemic approaches maximize resiliency in everybody and that's that connectiveness piece that says you know, if the school connects with everyone, if there are lots of activities and lots of efforts to connect, then kids are going to be harder to hurt. What a kid said to me the other day, she said some kids are harder to hurt than others and the question I asked them, this group of, of very bright kids in a privileged school system where they've had a great education, fifth graders, I said so why is that. They had no idea. And some of them had the idea that some kids are just born harder to hurt than others then of course there's no hope. But the idea, we know very well there are lots of things that build resiliency and as we help kids focus on those things, then we make a really significant difference. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON So one of the things, and just to underline what you've just talked about, that strikes me about the, uh, your way of thinking and your approach, it really, the, the emphasis is not so much on the bully and trying to change the behavior of what we're calling for the purpose of this conversation, the bully. But you're really, this, this, uhm, emphasis on resiliency and alternative, uh, behaviors is catching. Okay. 

00:13:40
STAN DAVIS Well let me talk about that. Yeah, sorry, uh, I really want to discourage people not to use the word because it includes kids who are imitating media modeling and really know better and are just kind of taken, been taken over by what they see and what they think other people approve of. It includes kids who have impulsivity or an empathy deficit or otherwise some kind of skill lack that can be fixed and it includes a vanishingly small number of kids who truly choose to hurt others and calculate their actions for the maximum benefit. It's a very small number and we use one word to, to include those three groups of kids, then it's going to drive us to actions which won't be helpful. I think it's a really good idea to reduce the amount of mean behavior, just like it's a really good idea to have people who drink not drive. And I think enforcement of that standard in education is a great thing. So if we can cut the number of kids doing mean things in half, or we can cut the people, number of people who drink and drive in half, the frequencies come down, that's great. Then we also need to know that we haven't cut it to zero, and we have to look at, at, uh, resiliency and I think the most important thing there, is to see those as two separate interventions. I think what we were going for in the 50's, sorry, I think what we were going for in the 50's was to say if we change the behavior of the targeted kid, then through changing that behavior, will change the behavior of the mistreating kid. And, we've really learned in every aspect, whether it's, uhm, domestic violence or rape or other parallels, that the risk there is that we wind up blaming the mistreated person for the actions of the person who is mistreating them, by saying if you'd only done this or wouldn't do that or something. So I think instead we separate the two things. We make every effort to reduce the mean behavior and then we make every effort to heal and strengthen the kid who was mistreated. And so, a kid might learn to use breathing or self-calming, uh, to stop crying when they're mistreated. Not because stopping crying will change the behavior of the person that's mistreating them, it's really not their responsibility. But because, if they calm themselves then they will be harder to hurt and they won't feel so bad. And so that's a different frame in which therapists may do some of the same work they were doing before. But the frame doesn't wind up blaming the kid who is mistreated. 

00:16:10
RICH SIMON And so you have this, uh, this idea that resiliency, uh, isn't somehow some marvelous ability that some kids have and some kids don't, but the way I, I've heard you talk about it, is resiliency is a community phenomenon. Explain what you mean by that. 

00:16:25
STAN DAVIS Well I suppose internal cognitive phenomenon. If you look at Carol Dweck's work where she found that kids who, who attribute their successes to their choices and their actions are more likely to be able to find something to do when they're having failure than kids who attribute their successes to their traits. Because, if they feel smart when they succeed, then they feel stupid when they fail. So there's a kind of internal cognitive shift that makes a difference to the level of resiliency that people experience. So there aren't internal determinates of resiliency, many of them are cognitive skills that can be learned. We're cognitive reframing, where you say oh I noticed that person is mean to everyone, so it can't be just me. On the other hand, it's too much to expect kids who are mistreated consistently over time, to do all that resiliency building work on their own. And so the community supports resiliency when for example, kids hear kind things as, speech about themselves as well as mean speech which helps them sort out how much of what the mean stuff is being said is true. When kids are included and invited and, and, uh, sat with, then the, they're more likely to be able to filter out the mean behavior of someone else because they're doing it within social support. And that's true across any kind of channel, that when people have social support, they become more confident and resilient within themselves. So there's an interaction between those two things. 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON Yeah, so this is a, we're addressing, uh, mostly I think, an audience of, uhm, psychotherapists. They, they, some of whom may work in school systems, some not. But our, our idea here, our organizing idea is looking at the different challenges of rearing kids today from the viewpoint of parents. So as you, uh, and I know you, you've worked in, uh, all these settings and across different context. So let's, let's talk about the role of the parents when a child is being bullied. How do you, how do you, uh, work in that, in, in those circumstances? 

00:18:35
STAN DAVIS I back up and I think first we want to talk with parents about the things they can do preventively to increase inner strength and resiliency and that includes time spent together, it includes helping kids find a peer group that shares their values and that values them, which may or may not be in school. It'd be nice if every kid that was in school, but it's not necessarily true. Also having kids learn hobbies and other mastery experiences, so that even if things are going badly with every other person in the world, they can still get love from their guitar or their basketball or their, their drawing pencils. And, that servers as the backdrop so that if your child is mistreated, then there won't be as much harm done. And then in the situation, it's important to take a deep breath and not take too seriously the equation we hear on the news, which is that every, the idea that every child who is bullied is going to kill themselves which is not true. We, this catastrophizing which can lead us to panic and I guess I would ask three questions. First of all, how much is my child being hurt by this behavior at the moment? And based on the answer to that, we might choose three different paths. If my child is saying this bothers me a little but it's okay, and I don't see any impact on sleeping or eating or daily living or mood, then I say well all right just thanks for telling me about it and if there's anything you want me to do tell me, but in the meantime I'll listen with you, I'll spend a little more time with you. And it's the equivalent of your kid saying I've got a little stomachache but it's not too bad, and they have no temperature and you say okay, try a glass of milk, you know here let me read you a story. In the middle is stuff that you're really getting a bit more concerned about. The equivalent of a persistent stomachache, but not sharp pain over the abdomen and your kid is saying I, I hate school, I don't want school but they're still going. They're saying this bothers me, but they're still sleeping and having friends and doing other stuff and there in that intermediate range, I think it's reasonable to say to your kids should we go talk to the school, shall we do something about this, should we just wait and see. The same way you would with a stomachache. We say do you want to go to the doctor or not? And the kid says no, and you'd be fine with that. The kid says yes, you go. And then there are things where you really see an urgent need to do something. Sleeping is a problem, eating is a problem, the kid isn't functioning well, you're seeing maybe beginning signs of depression and again medically, you, you know, the kid is having a sharp pain where the, where the appendix is. And then if the kid says to you I don't want to go to the doctor, you say get in the car, call for the ambulance and there if the kid says I don't want you to talk to the people at school, you say we've got to, this has got to change. So that's a parental judgment, that, that's the first piece is making that distinction. The second piece is remembering what we found in our research, which is not to start giving your kid advice, the advice that says if you had only, if you hadn't, if you did this because we have all of these stereotypes, bullies back down when they're told to. Well that doesn't come with my life experience and we don't even know what bullies are. We don't know who the kid is dealing with so that kind of advice while it means well, really can make things worse for the kid because it says, the kid says I knew it was me, I knew this was my fault and now you're saying it is. So it's perfectly all right to say what have you tried, and then the kid says I did this but it didn't work, you say well it was worth trying. And even if parents want to say, tell the other person to stop, I would look at our research and say you can if you want to but just be aware that the kid might not listen. And the third thing is as much nurturing as you can so that the, the same kind of thing you would do with a kid who had a fever. You know, you read to them a bit more, you do more of the things they like with them. Now, I will suggest one more thing, which is the, the best thing for kids above age say nine or ten, is to have full on involvement with a peer group. It's really, in many ways, more important to kids than a lot of stuff they do with adults as they get older and so there may be things that we need to do to help a kid make that connection. Maybe a peer group connection should be based on an interested and as I said, maybe even outside of school and for some kids, kids on the autism spectrum, the kids who are extremely bright, kids who are, have kind of unusual social skills. For some kids their natural peer group is not their own age. For some kids their natural peer group is adults. For some kids their natural peer group may be someone else and anything you can do to give your kids the experience of there being some part of their lives where when they walk in the room, everybody is pleased to see them. That's a really important preventive. I was very influenced by Kip Williams' work in ostracism, that's the real reason I have and it's echoed in our work and so if we think of the wound of bullying is ostracism and isolation, then it really empowers us to do some things to reduce the isolation. 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON So that, when I hear you talk about this, the, the thing that I find, uh, particularly valuable, is the way in which the bigger picture that you keep creating. So if your, if your focus is I have to stop this bully from harming my child or the, or I have to change this person's behavior, you, you really do begin to feel this sense of helplessness, how can that happen and you really do, in your terms I guess, you've talked about this, is you get a lot of power to that, that particular individual. And it seems like the emphasis of your, of your way is like take that deep breath, the natural protective influence, uh, uh, impulse of a parent and then look more broadly. What is a kid who has been quote bullied and maybe ostracized is a more useful concept and understanding what the wound is, what the, what the, uh, what the danger is there in order to help that child. 

00:24:35
STAN DAVIS If the behavior is more extreme, then it's more likely that we're going to be able to change it. If the behavior is snickering or you know, quite, uh, lower level stuff, then it's less likely we're going to be able to change it. And certainly some parts of ostracism and relational aggression are more serious and higher level but we're not going to be able to stop everything. We'll do our best, I mean, as a parent I would like to have nothing bad ever happen in my child's life, uh, it's not going to work out that way. But if I can influence that I will, you certainly don't want to wish extra bad things to happen. So we do want to stop the, the bad stuff if we can, but there's a lot more stuff we can do as well to, to reduce the hurt and one of the things that I see sometimes in, in, uh, very nurturing, very caring homes is that kids have difficulty coming to terms with what it means that someone else is capable of doing mean things and sometimes that's even more acutely, uh, painful to them than what's being done to them and I think sometimes some parents go out of their way to portray the whole world as a wonderful benevolent place, I think kids need to know everywhere you go, there will be a few people who enjoy being mean to other people and maybe they'll change but at the moment I've never been anywhere where that isn't true and I would have parents say to their kids to study those people carefully from a distance so you don't marry someone like that. You do want kids to know this happens. It doesn't mean we won't try to stop it, but I, I don't think there are many places where some level of mean stuff doesn't happen and so while we're trying to stop it, we also need not to be hurt by it. Let me tell you a story. 

00:26:20
RICH SIMON Part of that, sure. 

00:26:20
STAN DAVIS All right one of the ways, one of the ways I learned about this is from hearing stories from parents and I was in New Hampshire and I met the mother of a 14 year old girl who told me I taught my daughter to filter and I said tell me more about that. She said well my 14 year old came out to her classmates as a lesbian in a small town in New Hampshire and I said to her, honey if you're going to do that, you're going to have to arrange your own internal self so you don't believe everything everyone says about you. So people may say things about you that you choose not to take into your heart, and it's such a lovely idea, the idea of the filter and again that's a community responsibility too, in other words I'll do my best to filter out negative actions by other people and not believe them, if adults will do their best to reduce the frequency and if other kids will help me by telling me good things about myself to wash my filter off if it gets sludgy, and this, this is, this is a concept in building resiliency that I've been talking about with kids in several continents lately and it's really exciting because kids will get not only how you can filter yourself, but how you can wash someone else's filter. So there, there's a cognitive concept that I learned from that parent, that's been very useful. 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah it's a great metaphor. Now what role in, in the way you work, does communication among parents play? We recently did an issue of the, the Networker called Our Parents Obsolete that inspired this series and one of the things we really talked about was how the, uhm, the very eroded sense of community amongst parents, uh, in today's world and how kids are highly interactive. So is, uh, from that perspective, what, what, what are some of your ideas about what's effective maybe what's not so effective? 

00:28:10
STAN DAVIS I'll give you an example. We had at, at my old school, uh, girls in fourth grade come in with a lot of makeup on and their skirts rolled up and their shirts pulled down, all of which they've done on the bus. And it really wasn't acceptable to a lot of the parents and it wasn't really acceptable to us, we would just have liked these kids not to be prematurely sexualized by the culture which is trying its best to do that too them. And many parents though, were having trouble acting because their kids were successfully running the you're the only parent who was bothered by this, ploy. So we had a community meeting, we had parents come in and said what do you think about this? And this very simple process in which parents were talking about how they felt about whether kids should do this or not, in which parents heard that other parents felt the same way as they did and then they felt more comfortable in setting some gentle limits on their kids about this and the kids got the message that they couldn't get away with the everyone else's parents thinks it's all right piece. And parents said it was all right for us to send kids into the bathroom to wash off their faces with support from them, wouldn't have become a punishment and the behavior stopped almost entirely. So without that forum in which parents could hear from each other, I don't agree with this either, then it would have been much more difficult because many parents really fear being the obsolete dinosaur parent who won't get with the modern program. And, uh, the other thing is that parents really need to know how thoroughly disproved some of the (inaudible ) and be willing to set some limits on their kids and be willing to have their kids be unhappy sometimes There's an article in the New York Times this week about increasing numbers of kids showing up at dentists offices later in toddler-hood, with rotten teeth and dentists are hearing from parents well he didn't feel good about brushing his teeth so I didn't feel I should make him. And so other than having 12 or 13 teeth under sedation at the age of three or four, and so really we, we did a very effective job in the 70's of advising parents that it was bad for children ever to be upset or frustrated or angry about anything and we need to do the job in reverse and make it clear to people that it is all right for kids to run into a loving boundary and be a little disappointed, in fact it's pretty good preparation for life. Uh, just an example, you know, at my school this is kids up to 5th grade, I saw smart phones on, belonging to kids in the hall almost every day this was a very low wage community that we were in and so I defy anybody to tell me why a nine year old needs unfiltered web access in their pocket, the ability to look at pornography anytime they want and yet each of these kids clearly told their parents, oh you don't understand dad, if I don't have a smart phone, my life is over. And their parents said oh honey, I don't want that and got them these things so, you know, here there are cell phones that can be programmed so they can only call mom, dad, their grandma and that, that's a reasonable response to wanting to keep in touch with the kid at age seven or eight or nine, but since we have this idea that if our kids are unhappy they'll be in therapy for the rest of their lives, then, uh, people hesitate to do that sort of thing. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON So you have a, uh, a very distinctive rather longitudinal perspective on the front lines of the whole culture of kids and schools over this, over these, uh, 20 years and really going back longer than that. 

00:32:10
STAN DAVIS I worked in high school and middle school and elementary schools, so I've seen this all. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON So, it, it, what's, this is one of the things that always comes, comes up when we're trying to make sociological generalizations that's, you know, there are certain universals and we pretend as if something has, is emerging as a new issue and it's in a slightly different form or maybe languaged differently, it's been going on for a long time. So as you look at this, this cavalcade of the youth culture over the last, uh, 20 years and particularly in, in schools, what stands out for you? What, what are, what, what really does seem different to you about the experience of being a kid in schools at these different levels that you just mentioned? 

00:32:55
STAN DAVIS Well here are the two things that I think are most different and then one realization has come to me that helps us understand this. The first is, that kids are seeing much more modeling of very mean behavior, done by people they admire and look up to, who are quite wealthy and that is this whole generation of reality stars who not only do mean things to each other but make a lot of money doing it and then go on the talk shows in character to talk about how much money they make doing it. That's a new phenomenon. If you look at a show like the Jersey Shore, they also have the characters turn to the camera and justify their mean behavior on camera. That's a totally new phenomenon, so that mean behavior is actually being marketed to kids aggressively for the first time, I think, in human history. There's been modeling, but it hasn't been consciously marketed to kids as a way of making money and we see that happening. And the other thing is that the, the advent of electronic technology has lead to kids having an accelerated fear of disconnection. The, uh, I think the book True Shoes, uhm, and I'm blocking on the name, a couple of young adult novels, The Revealers, Doug Wilhelm's The Revealers and his book True Shoes really portray this better than anything I've seen. Kids who are terrified that if they don't return text within 30 seconds, then the person on the other end is going to be offended and will say terrible things about them all over Facebook and the internet or if they, if they get a friend request, if they don't respond to that immediately, they're done or if they have their phone off for 10 minutes they're going to miss a whole generation of things. That's quite a new phenomenon and Doug does a great job of portraying a level of anxiety kids feel about the speed of which things can happen now, which is very different. In the old days if you wanted to spread a rumor, you had to do it kind of, in retell. You tell one person and they tell another person and they tell another person. It could take days to get around the school. Now you can have a list on your phone and you can list text a hundred people in five seconds and if that kid who this is about has their phone off for an hour, Doug says, they missed a whole, you know, 10 iterations of this and all of a sudden everyone sees them differently. So that's different. The positive learning is something I've learned from Cherise Nixon, who I'm honored to be doing research with, and this is this great hope here and that is looking at positive ways to change the teenage group dynamics that have existed forever. What Cherise says, is that kids come in to adolescence, hardwired with the need to be part of a group that has an effect on the world. And so kids come into adolescence, they form a clique, and their mission is to hurt and humiliate other people. And that's biologically driven unless we go out of our way to help kids construct a different meaning to a group they're in. The best example I know is the website free rice dot com, which encourages kids to form a group of students who then use the site for S-A-T preparation, they answer questions and every question the team gets right, triggers a donation by someone else of food to the world food program. So that what you're doing is forming teams that have an altruistic purpose and that have a direct and powerful impact, positively on the outside world. So when you involve groups of kids in community service of any kind, in tutoring, in, uh, in mentoring, then you take that biological or, or genetic drive of being part of a group that has an effect and you give it a different direction. And we've known that works way back from the, uh, summer camp social psychology research of (inaudible ), where the way they fixed the difficulties between groups in this camp, was to break the waterline so that everybody in the camp, all the kids had to work together physically to get the water supply back to camp and in the process of doing that, erased the inner group mean behavior that they'd seen before. So the idea of forming for the positive purpose, is I think one of the strongest directions we can go. So one of the things I'm most excited about, and that could happen electronically. You look at the book, Letters to Olivia, Olivia's Letters, letters to a bullied girl. These two sisters, two towns away from a kid who was having epileptic seizures and was being terribly mistreated, started a letter writing campaign to her and probably kept a kid from killing herself. They generated thousands of letters and so this and that can be used in this way, to mobilize support and connection for people. And so those are the, those are the positive directions that are changing, it's easier to create a support group now than it use to be and so that's some of the stuff that I'm hopeful about. This whole idea of altruistic reward is so exciting, that you can reward someone. You say to a class, if you work really well, we'll be able to go read to our reading buddies an extra time this week. Now our power comes in our ability to do good. So that is a tremendously exciting direction that we're working. 

00:38:15
RICH SIMON So we've, we've, we've, coming back to the influence of the digital culture on kids today and the ways in which, uh, parents are unsure about creating limits and, and the ways in which that digital world can take over kids lives. So in, in terms of helping parents to get this sort of big picture and what is, what are the, uh, kind of appropriate guidelines for parents to have with their kids in regard to the internet and internet access and that, the whole, you know, the infinite horizons of the internet. What are some ideas that you find most useful. 

00:38:55
STAN DAVIS Well it was this prophetic look, a long time ago, before most of us were aware of this stuff, Ron Tapple's book, The Second Family and I think Ron's work in this area is still the best that's been done in many ways. Well I'll suggest a couple of other people and Ron said what I see evolving, he said, most people didn't see it then. He saw a second family developing that would welcome kids in uncritically, that would say to kids oh hey, now that you're 13 or 14, don't bother with that family you were born to, here we are for you. And the parents needed to gear up to compete with that second family, for their kids' membership in the first family. And I think what he said is true, that we need to find ways to stay connected, if we use to talk while we did the dishes, and that's not working anymore, we need to find another context to talk. Maybe we set up a time every night that our child and us text to each other, or maybe we just do different actvities the kids enjoy and in the context we talk. But so the first thing he said was we need to find a way to sustain our connection with our kids into adolescence. It's a myth if kids don't want us to be connected with them. The second thing that's important is to moderate our responses to some of the iffy electronic things because if kids think that they are going to be completely disconnected from the digital concern about something that's been posted on their Facebook page, we can guarantee that they won't come to us. For better or for worse, that connection has become vital for kids and they need to maintain it. So, what we need to do is find a way to be in it, to supervise it, to get involved in it as much as we can and teach within it. One of the most interesting studies that was done in the last decade, was about the impact of television and other screen media on kids, which reported in the Times, these people found that if people took the one simple step of moving screens into a shared space in the house and out of the bedroom, then the kids spent less time on screens, watched more appropriate things and were more likely to discuss what they watched with adults. So that's the difficulty of course with smart phones, is they're by definition, not a shared space and it also takes some work. My good friend Elizabeth Englander of Bridgewater state university, surveys her incoming freshmen and the vast majority of them say their parents had no idea how much screen time they were spending. Many of them report having gone to bed when their parents when to bed, setting a quiet alarm for the middle of the night, waking up in the middle of the night while their parents were asleep and thought they were asleep, spending maybe three hours online, getting back in bed, setting another alarm and their parents had no idea and they said this had gone on for years. So, it's not so easy and yet, the question, the question about smart phones where the smart phones should be at night, is an interesting question. Whether, whether kids should have screens in their rooms. Again, what was fascinating at the (inaudible ) study, was that a small environmental change lead to a very substantial behavior change. And the third thing is that kids need to do their own thinking about what this digital citizenship means. I love that word better than cyber bullying idea. What does it mean to be a good citizen of this new world? What does it mean to be a safe citizen of this world? What does it mean for others to be safe? And what a number of us has found is when you phrase it that way, and you ask kids to create codes and ways of being through digital, positive digital citizenship, they are full of ideas and there are always some things that most people what they need from adults is the long term time perspective. To be able to look at what happens if this continues over time, to be able to look at what happens if an employer sees this, to be able to look at how much harm can be done. The difficulty with screen aggression is that there's a, naturally, a diminished sense of empathy for the other because you can't see them, or you know, feel them, you don't feel with them and so that's something that parents need to help kids develop. 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON So stay with this idea for a moment because there's this, that's one of the, one of those, uhm, issues that comes up again and again, is in fact their, uh, uh, uh, diminution of empathy amongst kids that were creating a culture and with so much of our lives having screen times where, uhm, and since, and we're, and there's not a consequence when we, uh, do mean things, or immediate consequence. In some ways we're rewiring our, our children to be a different sort of person. Is there any substance to that or is that just, is that kind of an a alarmism? 

00:43:50
STAN DAVIS It's both. What I love about Doug Wilhelm's books, that I mentioned, is that they really are written from the point of view, both are written from the point of view of kids who have tremendous empathy for their peers, which is being overloaded by the volume of information that comes in, the difficulty in, in solving problems. No, I see this generation being tremendously empathic and tremendously concerned for others. There are two difficulties. One is, naturally, even with an acceptable level of empathy, it's easier to block the effect of screen behavior because even empathic there's less data coming in. And the second thing is the world, the digital world they're living in is so complex, that it's difficult to know what to do with your empathy and, and Doug's second book True Shoes is great, there's another book called Gamer Girl. I think for adults to read the, the young adult fiction, which portrays these dilemmas, is very useful. Because not only is it hard to understand what this can be like, the speed of it, the pace of it, the complexity of it, is past anything any of us can imagine. And, so, the, the first question is the empathy the second is and what do we expect these kids to do. I see kids trying, most kids trying to do a very good job as citizens of the planet and as citizens of their peer group. 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, okay. And, and, so the, and within the educational system itself, the way in which kids learn, they're involvement in school, the way in which learning takes place in the, in, in the world today. Talk a little bit, you're, I'm, I'm addressing you here as a frontline anthropologist, uh, uh, and, uh, so forgive me for doing that, putting you in that position. But what, just, you're, you're, uhm, what, what are you observing about that? A way in which kids, their behavior as students and learners in school systems, if in fact it has changed over the last 20 years and if it has, in what ways? 

00:45:40
STAN DAVIS Well there are three competing, at least three, maybe more, competing directions that are pulling education in different ways. One of them is the combination of the focus on test results and fact retention paired with reduced budgets. And the emphasis on test results comes from no child left behind and the reduced budgets comes from financial cuts everywhere. Those two things together, push teachers into lecture mode and they push teachers into fact drill mode. And the interesting thing is that is against the major trend in education over decades, which is to involve kids more in group work and more in understanding in depth. And so we have those two trends absolutely at war with each other. And then the third thing that's in the way, is, is an effort by someone on the, someone on the political right, to challenge any effort to have kids think about empathy or diversity and as a plot to brainwash kids. So, it's very complex and you have those three directions going on. I think many teachers would rather teach in a more collaborative way, in a more, in a way that involves more in depth skill mastery and that involves the willingness and ability to work with a lot of other people. And those two forces, the no child left behind and budget forces and pressure from the right are pushing good teachers out of teaching, because they're made to be, uh, people who cram facts into kids and then make sure those facts are in there. I know several people who have retired from teaching earlier than they really wanted to, because they weren't enjoying being just a vending machine that was forcing facts into kids and then seeing if that had been developed. So that's the struggle, is I think at a time where we really know what we need to do and a lot of people won't do it. It's becoming harder to do. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON All right so we, we just have a few minutes left and let's come back to the, uh, the role that so many of the folks who are listening to our conversation here today, as therapists. What is it people who are child therapists, family therapists, working in agencies, working in, perhaps working in private practice, maybe working in schools as well. If there are two or three things that, that are, uh, that perhaps may be at odds with more traditional training and working as a child therapist or a family therapist, that you would like the listeners here today to, and viewers, to be aware of. What stands out for you? How do we need to update the conventional wisdom of being, uh, pro-family child-oriented psychotherapist in today's world? 

00:48:30
STAN DAVIS I don't know what except this is new for everybody, it is certainly for some people and I think we have to be comfortable being advocates and I think part of that advocacy is to say to the school, say to the school with the parents, this behavior has the potential to hurt this kid I'm seeing. I don't think we have to say has hurt this kid we're seeing, but behavior has the potential to hurt this kid I'm seeing, and I think you should do everything you can to stop it. Please stop trying to expect this kid to make this go away by themselves. Please stop telling them not to let it bother them. So I think when the therapists say that to schools, schools are much more likely to listen than if they have just parents saying it to them. Not that parents aren't important, but parents are seen as a bit biased, a therapist says there's potential for harm here, which I don't think we have to say there is harm. There's potential for harm here and then, uh, that's, that needs to be said. And sometimes that'll trigger change in the part of the school that's maybe not doing the best job. Some schools do, some don't. The second is independent of the idea that the kids we see should be able to change other people's behavior. We should work to strengthen those kids so that they themselves have more control over whether they're hurt if someone chooses to do something mean to them. And that intervention can be both individual and family systemic and community systemic, the three things I talked about. So you can work individually with a kid to help them reframe what's being done to them or to help them think about themselves differently, to help them in that mother's words, filter and decide what to take into the heart. And you can also work with the family to create more opportunities for the kid to be more included and be part of things and therefore to be healed in that way. And the third thing that I would urge people to do, is get away from the labeling words, bullying, victim, uh, even bystander and recognize that any one kid might be influenced by all those three things. They might be doing mean things to others, they might be having mean things done to them but the third thing is that Hasler's(sp) work, other people's work, documents very high levels of stress and insipient trauma among kids who see mean behavior and don't know what to do about it. Because it threatens their sense of themselves as good people or their view of the universe, and so, to ask about all three of those things, rather than to feel that we know that a child is a bully or is a victim, or is a bystander, for most kids, this phone never rings and here it is. For most kids, they're really experiencing, they're experiencing some potential trauma in all three of those spheres and it's worth asking. 

00:51:25
RICH SIMON Right. Okay, all right well so, before we stop, you have a, uh, a website and a lot of, uh, you have a very, you're on the frontlines, you have a very fresh perspective on a lot of issues that perhaps therapists in their offices are, are not as familiar with the day to day nitty gritty of kids' lives today. So tell us a little bit about the, your, your, uh, your website and the kinds of, uh, resources that therapists can find there. 

00:51:50
STAN DAVIS Okay well the website is stop bullying now dot com and I've just completey rewritten it after tinkering with it for years so I'll be adding to it. But there's, there's a page for parents, there's a page for kids and the page for kids is where I would suggest therapists go first in terms of the kinds messages we want young people to have. And then I'd suggest they look at the page for parents. There, I've written two books now about this work and I'm working on a third and so, I think those are worth looking at and I've put some other information up specifically about this issue of bullying and whether that's the right word and the right concept and then about what schools can do. And the other place I would go is the national effort to stop bullying dot gov, or stop bullying now dot gov. They, they've worked with both, uh, web addresses, has a couple of worksheets. One specifically for therapists in working with kids that have been bullied that I wrote, and that I think outlines some of the issues fairly, you know, as well as I could. So, uh, those are some good resources. And then I always like hearing from people, my email address is on the website and I, I enjoy hearing from other therapists and about how we do this work, because I think there are, certainly we can do (inaudible ). 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON That, so that leads us naturally into calling as we always do, call attention to the comment board, uh, and that let's keep this conversation going. It is a conversation that I haven't heard enough of and you, you've opened up a whole doors to a whole number of ways of looking at kids and the, the struggles that kids and, and their parents have in today's world. So let's hear from the folks who have been watching and listening today on the comment board. I think we have somebody who will, uh, be responsive to your questions, your comments, whatever stood out for you, whatever it happens to be. Let's keep this conversation going. Stan, what a pleasure to have this opportunity to, to talk with you and to, uh, to learn from your extensive experience in, uh, the world of, uh, of kids today and the world of schools today. Thank you so much for, uh, sharing this with all of us. 

00:54:00
STAN DAVIS Okay, thank you Rich. Take care. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Take care everybody, that's it for now. Bye bye.
