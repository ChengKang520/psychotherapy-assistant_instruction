BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategist in the area of Brief Therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

ENABLING THERAPEUTIC CHOICES: THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN REALITY THERAPY William Glasser, M.D. 

00:01:50
[sil.] 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON I'm Jon Carlson. I like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest Bill Glasser. 

00:02:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Hi. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS Who is going to talk to us about his approach to Brief Therapy. Bill, just how would you define Brief Therapy? 

00:02:10
WILLIAM GLASSER, M.D. REALITY THERAPIST Well, I define brief therapy has therapy that's effective in a relatively short period of time and I don't… I don't rule out one session. 

00:02:20
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:02:20
WILLIAM GLASSER When you can do a lot in one session, but I don't do brief therapy any differently than I would do any other therapy, I think, I said it before and I'll say it again, when any person came into my office, I did each time as if this maybe the last. So I would try to do as much as I could each time, the therapy became brief when we felt we are this particular cases of perfect example of someone that Ann Mary that I thought one session was enough in terms of my prescription. Now, if she had said I'd like to come back, if I would have said, do you like to have my number, you're going to be living your life, certainly I'd like to talk to you again, but I don't see words necessary for us to talk to immediately and so, that would be a perfect example of Brief Therapy. 

00:03:10
DIANE KJOS So in a sense, all of the work that you do is Brief Therapy, would that be correct. 

00:03:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Even… even one guy that I saw for 30 years, it was… it was Brief Therapy because that's… that's what was needed. I mean, this guy was homicidal and my job over the 30 years was to keep him from killing someone. 

00:03:30
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:03:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and I did… I did and then, now sometimes two, three years went by and I didn't see him, but I always felt he was my client and he was a… a person that, well the colleague in my office that would see him occasionally when I would go out of town, I came back one time and the man said to me never get… never get, I never want to see, I never want this guy to walk into my office again. He was a rough kind of a client and I was, well, for many years I was worried he was going to kill me too. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:03:55
WILLIAM GLASSER I had his guns in my office for four years, just… but I mean the point is, to get a… getting off the track here, but the point is you don't… I don't work differently if I'm constrained by time. 

00:04:10
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON Talk about your strategy or your approach, just how does it work? 

00:04:15
WILLIAM GLASSER My approach is based on choice theory. Choice theory says, that all of us are driven by basic needs… and we have to choose how we satisfy. We're not like animals, we are also driven by basic needs, but animals have the behaviors built in. We basically humans, I think may be crying as possibly a built in behavior and certainly the ability to anger that's the emotion is a built in behavior because I've seen new born babies little mad as a hornets you know when they come out. because it is not as nice out as it was in and so… but… but pass that we choose it all and so clients come to me because they're making inadequate choices in their genetic purpose, which is to satisfy five needs, love… love, powerful and freedom and survival. Survival as all creatures have survival, so I'm trying to find out how they're doing which I were in this person, she came in and said I'm unhappy because they're pressuring me to get married and I don’t think maybe it's the right thing to do and yet I feel I being missing something and all the things that she talked about and… and these were all choices and my job is to help her to evaluate the choices she's making. So an important part of reality therapy is evaluation, but it's not just a separate little thing, the whole session is an evaluative procedure from start to finish, everything I'm trying to tell her is to make an evaluation, it's my life and I had to tell her is about your life. I do remind it little bit that's okay and so that's the therapy and I… 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON How does change takes place? 

00:05:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Change… 

00:06:05
JON CARLSON I mean can you take it that step next change. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Change takes place through the relationship between the client and myself because it's not relationship which is a trusting relationship and the trust is this man no way he will hurt me, because very few therapies are going to hurt people, but… but this… this man really wants to help me, this man does not afraid of me, this man does not afraid of confronting me on a even playing field and I'm a person that has capabilities and even when I work with those so called, I know, "believe in such thing is schizophrenia" but certainly people do believe in it and… and… and they almost never talk crazy to me because… because I was having no interest in their craziness and the craziness is just their way of dealing with their very… very… unsatisfying relationship in their life and but I was saying here I am, I want to talk to you, as they start to talk crazy and like, you know… you know the difference between talking crazy and I don’t know I just was really a talk saying to me for a while, talk to him and again I mentioned him what? He'd say that the patient you are come here, you're crazy, we teach you to be same and… and yeah that's good doctor, he say and so, but… but, so my job is to create the relationship which gives them the trust to express their fears, their feelings, their loves, their hates, whatever it is, to a human being who is capable of dealing with it, not afraid of it and if I… I were in the problem, the way I say to people, I mean, if I were in your shoes I wouldn’t know what to do? 

00:07:40
JON CARLSON So the change comes from the relationship? 

00:07:40
WILLIAM GLASSER The relationship is the core of it, without the relationship, because that's what they're lacking. It's like a man would come to you hungry. In some places, if you, this is analogy, the counselor would talk a lot about food. 

00:07:55
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:08:00
WILLIAM GLASSER But I think what the hungry man really want is to get food, to be fed, not talk about it. Not talk about dieting or proteins or carbohydrates or calories. I'm hungry, for goodness sake give me something to eat. 

00:08:10
DIANE KJOS So not to talk about relationship, but to get a relationship. 

00:08:10
WILLIAM GLASSER That's right, they… they… they… they know they should get a legitimate relationships and… and it works. I mean, I… 

00:08:15
DIANE KJOS What… what influence do you too move in this direction can you talk about that? 

00:08:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, yeah, I can tell you exactly when I started out my training at UCLA in 1954 was the VA and usually combined three years of psychiatric residency and but was especially I gone to the outpatient part, the last year. They were… they were telling me things like you know you… you… you got to be careful and… and that you have to help them gain insight and it seem to me that all the people that saw me were lonely. Loneliness was the problem, and I'm talking about, they were telling me to talk about things away from the loneliness and so, I said, insight doesn't mean anything, everybody is filled with insight, they're lonely they can't use it and so it's not the people lack inside and then that we talked about mental illness, I would believe there is such a thing is mental illness or Alzheimer's disease where there is something the brain turns to Swiss cheese and stuff, but its this DSM4 you know the book. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON Sure. 

00:09:25
WILLIAM GLASSER That's… that's a very accurate book in one respect, it some… some people make very great effort to describe the various choices that people make when they are unhappy and they're unhappy in the sense because they don't have relationships and their happiness because they can't satisfy their needs, just to go down the line. 

00:09:45
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:09:45
WILLIAM GLASSER All they are and… and so, one people say, well would you treat it obsessive compulsive different from the psychotic, that's all the same problem, it's… it's… it's… it's… it's just like they're all hungry, but you got to figure out food to eat and stuff like that. It doesn't make any difference to what the diagnosis, so in reality therapy you don't go with the past unless there is positive things in the past that you can build on, this woman had a little bit of a positive stuff in her… in her past. She had a good job, she liked it, she get well. 

00:10:10
JON CARLSON That's next interview we're going to see. 

00:10:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:10:15
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:10:15
WILLIAM GLASSER And so, the other… the other thing is the, you don't… you don't focus on the problem… I don't care if the person is suffering form, I… I, change them all, even Albert Ellis is changing over that now. I put him on the verbs form, the person is depressing not depressed, the person is obsessing, not obsessed, person is crazy and not schizophrenic and things like that. So the… the point is that if you get rid of focusing on the symptom, get rid of avoiding anything you possibly can in terms of except focusing on the problem which is the relationship, don't talk about the past, because you can't relive the past, you can't relive a second ago much those to rest of your life, but you might look into the past for previous good relationships, not lousy ones, but good relationships. 

00:11:00
JON CARLSON Other steps or stages that you follow, you know, when you're working with somebody? 

00:11:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, people use my therapy have worked out steps and stages and all that inject to that really, because I use to teach him in steps and stages like what you want, what you're doing, is it, is what you are doing getting you what you want and let's make a plan to do it better? 

00:11:25
JON CARLSON So those might be the logical? 

00:11:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Those were the logical things, but I don't… I worry that all that takes place but not in steps and stages. I sense, the first thing I worry about is getting the relationship going. I don't want to go stay to a stranger what you want, I mean, they'll tell me something, that mean anything. I have to reach out to the person in some way and… and some people you're real kind and warm and something… 

00:11:55
JON CARLSON When you get in over to look for though, don’t you to help somebody to… to change? These questions can be helpful. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, yeah… yeah, but I mean, I don't… I don't approach everyone the same. Some people they approach for a matter of fact, some people you kind of go around the bar and before you come up with it, but you get there when I say go on the bar, I don't mean, for weeks but… 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM GLASSER …I want to find out the crucial person. Most of the time they come in and they tell me the person because that's what they say, like this yeah people do that. But who could it be, I mean father, mother, brother, sister, child, grandmother, grandfather, wife, husband, boss, school teacher, it's only seven or eight people that it could be. I mean, it's pretty more refined. 

00:12:45
JON CARLSON Pretty finite. 

00:12:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and you find it, and it's not hard to find it, it's… it's quick. Within five minutes usually, but sometimes takes in every ten or fifteen minutes and the person who has done it, but I'll tell you doctor, I feel so terrible all the time when you're talking about my relationships. I say, I'm talking about your relationships because your relationships and something is probably wrong with them is why you feel terrible and if I'm wrong about that I'll be the first one to tell you I was wrong, but this is… this is what we have to talk about and you know who it is, tell me. If you want to make me ask you few questions, I'll ask you too. Okay we're going to be around the butcher. 

00:13:25
DIANE KJOS Are there… are your client said that are more difficult or clients they just doesn't work with them all? 

00:13:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, the clients are very difficult to the ones… their motor stopped. They… they got nothing going, you know, there, they… they had given up, you know, I'll never get a relationship, no one cares for me. I'm hopeless, I'm worthless. The people who are depressing big time, because depressing is the most common of all the symptoms that people choose when they lose their relationships by far the most common. But… but they choose it for a purpose, but the purpose makes it difficult, the purpose is number one, all these symptoms in the whole DSM4, this book of symptoms all these symptoms are for three purposes. The first and most important by far is, since we're social creatures and we need people and we don't find the people we need, we build up a tremendous head of anger and than if we lift the anger out, whatever relationship we have will become harmed by letting the anger out. So most people have discovered letting the anger out, is not a good thing to do, like little kid apparently let him bang his head against the floor, until he finds, that's a stupid thing to do, I'll start to depress a little bit, then they'll really pay attention to me and then when kid goes putting on this little depressing act and then you pay attention. People learn this very early in life and we're good teachers, they all see depressing around and so the second reason is, depressing and all these others said about depressing number one, the most powerful cry to help the human beings to figure out. It's a very hard to walk by a stranger who you see as obviously depressing very strong that's why I answer something wrong, can I help you, I mean it’s a powerful thing and the third one, people don’t realize, but that the third one is important too. This symptom helps you to avoid a situation, which you're afraid to deal with. I've lost my job and also I say, well get your resume out you are a good person get him out, oh, you're right, you are completely right, next week. I say, why next week, well I'm just too upset because if you get him out quickly you're going, you get rejected, you're just not able to handle it. So we've all said, I'm not up to doing that right now. That's our little way of excusing ourselves from encountering difficulty that we know is there for 50 years old, and you lost your job and you're looking for way and it's tough. Rejection is the number one, and that's how you lose the relationships to reject and so, all that's in my mind and I knew there were going to cover that, then we're going to cover this quick as I can and I also know that… that's where I'm going to start, now as I get started, then all these things come up. Now what you're doing, a very common question, I answer like a couple of these people are coming they are really hard to work within is nothing is going on, so I just, I had a very good method of working with him. I just say, I want to know what you did yesterday. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:16:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And yesterday with these kind of people is as good as any day for the rest of their life. 

00:16:25
DIANE KJOS It gives you the model. 

00:16:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And then… and then, I can just say to them, I started saying well how did this help you, this gets you, etc. So when you understand reality therapy and choice theory, you're never sitting there, wondering what to say… what to say is bubbling through your mind all the time, when to say it, how to say it? That's what you're wondering about. 

00:16:45
JON CARLSON We have mentioned to… to our viewers about this interview or this women that you worked with, that's where we're going to move to next, we're going to watch your interview with the women named Ann Mary. 

00:17:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:17:00
JON CARLSON But before we do that, can you talk about what was going on inside of you before you began the interview and what was your plan of action there. 

00:17:05
WILLIAM GLASSER My plan of action is, I've got to create a relationship with her and I've got to find out what relationship in her life is not going the way she wants and I've got to find out what she's doing about it and is she doing anything terribly symptomatic about like depressing horribly and things like that. I'm… I'm assessing her strength on a, I thought of something the other day and I can't think of it but would be put into when I get, I can’t think of it right now, but anyway and then I want to look at her when she walks in, because people walk-in… in different ways. 

00:17:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and like when a greater actor walks on the stage you can tell a lot about that person just by the way they walk on the stage. Well, I'm not a great director, but these are my actors and they're walking on my stage and I take a look at her and I, and all us all that prays her strength. Is this going to be a person that just the way she sits down, the way she looks at me, the first few words that come out of her mouth, I'll say to myself well this is going to be a… a person that we can establish a relationship, I think pretty quickly. Sometimes I'm wrong about that and also people would come in and… and hand you this business too, oh, doctor, I'm so glad to see you, I've heard a lot about you, I know you're going to help, I say all my heart going off and then I'll say, this is going to be a tough person, you know because you're already setting out for failure, they're setting you up as the greatest actor in the world and then they're going to say, but you couldn't help me easy, and then they… they smile and they hang on to their misery because whatever their misery is, it's the best they can do at the time. 

00:18:50
JON CARLSON But I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag, but unfortunately that's not going to happen in a situation and, let's get in and watch Ann Mary and we'll watch her maybe as if were you. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

00:19:05
ANN MARY Hi doctor. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM GLASSER It's good to meet you. 

00:19:05
ANN MARY Nice to me you too. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Call me Dr. Glasser or Bill I… I use first names, and if you're comfortable, call me doc I don't care what you call me, it doesn't make that much difference to me, but we're here and you came to see me for, well tell me the story, I like everybody is got a story, what's your story? 

00:19:25
ANN MARY My story is I'm 35 years old, grew up the only child with very protective… very protective family, now that I'm 35, I'm in a career and I'm working and I'm doing things I like. The only problem is my family is like wanting to know why I won't get married. 

00:19:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, they want you to get married, they want grandchildren? 

00:19:50
ANN MARY Right. 

00:19:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Well, how you're dealing with it. 

00:19:55
ANN MARY I don't know. Everybody keeps telling me there is something wrong with me, because it's something I'm not pursuing right now, so everybody things that there is you know there is something wrong with that because I should be wanting that. 

00:20:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, one thing about everybody this quote everybody, is everybody knows what's right for you right. 

00:20:15
ANN MARY Correct. 

00:20:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay and sometimes everybody does know what's right for you, but many times they don't. So how you actually, what… what's the problem, I mean that what's going on in your life, do you want to what you want? 

00:20:35
ANN MARY Well, see that's the whole thing, I don't know. I'm… I'm in a relationship right now with the wonderful man who also is wanting to get married and I just for some reason I just can't make that commitment and… 

00:20:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, the some reason, means for some reason you don't want to do it, that's all. I mean, up break in the law or anything like that. What is the relationship? Is it living together or is just seeing a lot or what is it? 

00:21:05
ANN MARY No actually it's a long distance relationship and my schedule, I'm taking, I'm working on a masters right now and I have a little few things in the fire(ph), so I can't see him as much and it's starting to take a toll on the way things are going and it's this constant pressure you know to make him, to make up my mind and make a decision. 

00:21:30
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. So how far away is he? 

00:21:35
ANN MARY 650 miles. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So he is not around the corner anything like that and does he appreciate your situation with this masters degree which must mean something to you working forward? 

00:21:45
ANN MARY He says he does, but I… I don't know you know. 

00:21:50
WILLIAM GLASSER What's his view of life, when… when he says let's get married what… what would be doing in the marriage just still I have some idea from his standpoint? 

00:22:00
ANN MARY Doesn't being together, doing things together all the time. He is told me my life wouldn't have to change at all, but I would just you know he would just be there, but I would still have my independents and you know be able to do what I want, but I would just have another person there. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM GLASSER But I mean we wait till you finish your masters degree. 

00:22:25
ANN MARY He says he would. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Huh… huh. 

00:22:30
ANN MARY He says. 

00:22:30
WILLIAM GLASSER How long is that away. 

00:22:30
ANN MARY I'd be done in June of 2001. 

00:22:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay so you got a little over a year to go. 

00:22:35
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:22:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay and… and, this master degree is its important to you I gather. 

00:22:40
ANN MARY Yeah it is. 

00:22:40
WILLIAM GLASSER What is the subject? 

00:22:45
ANN MARY It's an education. 

00:22:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Huh… huh… okay and have you worked in education? 

00:22:50
ANN MARY Yes, I'm a teacher, right now. 

00:22:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Are you… you imported as a teacher. 

00:22:50
ANN MARY Yes, I am. 

00:22:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so this is a… a slower masters, is a nighttime masters and then weekend masters and… 

00:22:55
ANN MARY Correct. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM GLASSER So is your idea, if you would say marry this man whether you would keep teaching. 

00:23:10
ANN MARY I would keep teaching but I'd have to go live with him in his state and you know that's why I'm buying that, my life isn't going to change because I think it would be a major and then it's like I don't know, you know if it's just that I'm not in love if it's just that I can't make that kind of, if I'm just don't have the capability of making a long-standing commitment. 

00:23:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… Hmm. 

00:23:35
ANN MARY I don't know which it is, I go back and forth. 

00:23:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, is this the… the kind of the, one of the better relationships you've had, this isn't the first one I gather? 

00:23:45
ANN MARY No… no he's very good to me. I mean, really he is in, you know the stuff he does other women you know would just dream of, you know. 

00:23:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Its considered kind of… 

00:24:00
ANN MARY Right and I'm just kind of like whatever and I don't know if that's just my fear of making that type of life change or if it's just the side really don't want to. I don't know. 

00:24:15
WILLIAM GLASSER You say there is… there is some kind of a fear that you have in this moving 650 miles, getting a new job teaching, moving in with the man, there is something about this that you are concerned about it? 

00:24:30
ANN MARY Absolutely. 

00:24:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And I wonder if you could kind of voice you concern because I… I mean, I can… I can kind of see what it might be, I… I mean, I don't know it's just my guess, you know. 

00:24:40
ANN MARY See, Bill I don't know if it's just him or if I would just be like that with everybody or anybody, I don't know that's… 

00:24:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, that you will know, obviously because that's impossible to find out, but you know that there is a lot of good things about him, but there is some things about going ahead and following what he want, it bothers you but I'm not sure that you're not jumping? 

00:25:05
ANN MARY Right and I don't know why. 

00:25:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean, I think you have some idea. 

00:25:15
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:25:15
WILLIAM GLASSER If you talk about the idea it could be better. I mean, I can't put words in your mouth, but something bother, you know It's not a mystery, total mystery to you. 

00:25:25
ANN MARY Well you know, it's, but he is, he was married for 22 years and… 

00:25:25
WILLIAM GLASSER That he is older that you right? 

00:25:30
ANN MARY Yeah, he's not a lot older, maybe he's six years… 

00:25:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Eh, eh, so you got married really young. 

00:25:35
ANN MARY Right. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Because of your family. 

00:25:35
ANN MARY He's got two kids who are pretty much grown, ones like 21 the other is 18. 

00:25:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, kids aren't the factor then? 

00:25:45
ANN MARY No… no. But it's just that he has got to kind of tendency I think in, his… his wife had passed away, so. 

00:25:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So he is not divorced, his wife is died, he is a widower? 

00:26:00
ANN MARY Right. 

00:26:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:26:00
ANN MARY And I think that he was the one who was like the primary decision maker and you know… 

00:26:05
WILLIAM GLASSER In other way his wife was relatively dependent upon him to kind of run the show. Is that what you're saying. 

00:26:10
ANN MARY Exactly, hmm… hmm. 

00:26:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And you can see him. 

00:26:15
ANN MARY Occasionally he tries to do that with me and I just like. 

00:26:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean you know about it. It's your independence you're going to lose little bit, eh? 

00:26:25
ANN MARY Right. But now I'm… I'm deciding do I really like this independence thing or is a just a reason that I'm giving everybody for not warning do you know to make that commitment. 

00:26:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Well it's, you know it's if anyone can tell you that, but there is a reason. I mean, here the guy is kids are growing up and not depended on him does he make a fairly good living? 

00:26:50
ANN MARY We'll see, that's what bothers me, I don't know because it's like, he's from the south and up in the mid-west here we're very fast paced and bigger so on(ph), I think he makes an okay living, but he doesn't really… his work ethics are totally different than… than mine or my family and I worry about that. 

00:27:10
WILLIAM GLASSER That's the difference. Yeah, just kind of like, live today or tomorrow take care of itself kind of a thing. 

00:27:15
ANN MARY Yeah, like how its only money, you know how and I don't know up here it's you know, you have to hassle and down there I don't know if it's they're just you know… 

00:27:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I don't know, I can't judge the south with the north but I mean his work ethic which means some of the ways he approaches life, if he's not a, he is in his 40s already now. 

00:27:40
ANN MARY Right. 

00:27:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, it's like he's going to change a great deal at this stage of the game. 

00:27:45
ANN MARY Right and then he's not happy in what he is doing and he wants to find a new career and at that age it's like not that 40s, that old, but it's like by that time you should be set and thinking about you know planning for your retirement, not gee I think I'm going to you know be an airline pilot this week, you know and that bothers me. 

00:28:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. So he expresses some dissatisfaction with the way things are for him right now. 

00:28:15
ANN MARY Absolutely and… 

00:28:15
WILLIAM GLASSER And how does he, how do you fill into that… that's the thing… 

00:28:15
ANN MARY Well, it's like, he things that if we get married, everything is just going to be fine. He'll be… he'll be happy. You know he doesn't like being alone. 

00:28:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:28:25
ANN MARY He doesn't like… I don't know he's kind of very needy you know and it's like well if we get married this will be solved and you know I… I don't see how, I just think that you know you can't depend on another person to make you happy. 

00:28:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I think you're right there. That mean you find happiness with another person, but other people don't make us happy that I agree with you completely, do you feel, and this is just a little guess on my part, but I'm trying to sense what's going on here. Do you feel a little bit that if you get hooked up with this guy that he'll be controlling of you a little bit? 

00:29:05
ANN MARY I'm more worried about that. I mean, I think right now he holds to decorate because he knows. 

00:29:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well, now it's easier, 600 miles apart. 

00:29:10
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm and he knows I'm, you know because I put my foot down an lot and say, you know no that's not your decision and you know I've done that in the past, so I think he's trying of hold this back, but I think he could be kind of controlling and this is actually the first time, I mean, I've had relationships, but that I've had a real serious one where I've thought along these lines. 

00:29:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm, probably this you didn't think that much about it, but… 

00:29:35
ANN MARY No, I've had relationships the longest was like three months, you know. 

00:29:40
WILLIAM GLASSER What happen to your other relationships little bit? 

00:29:40
ANN MARY I'm a lot of the time and I learned that it was like, I was always the one doing all the work and trying… 

00:29:50
WILLIAM GLASSER So you attract the guys that see you as a kind of a can do it person, huh? 

00:29:55
ANN MARY Right and then, I had the last relationship I had, I just after that went to hell, I just said forget it. I'm just… 

00:30:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Why you'd go to hell? 

00:30:10
ANN MARY You know I don't know, he it was like he'd say one thing and you know did a totally different thing. 

00:30:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay so you just said this isn’t for me? 

00:30:15
ANN MARY No, and I just had kind of given up on the whole idea you know and decided that I was going to live my life alone and I would still have a good life and you know he wasn’t very comfortable with that idea for the last five years. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't consider yourself a real needy person then? 

00:30:30
ANN MARY No, I don't. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, I mean, you can take care of things. You had desperate to have a child today or tomorrow. 

00:30:40
ANN MARY No, I'm not even sure. 

00:30:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Your biological clock is at the top of you mind now. 

00:30:45
ANN MARY No… no… no. 

00:30:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

00:30:45
ANN MARY So, but then… 

00:30:50
WILLIAM GLASSER So what does this guy, I mean tangibly what does he offer you the you don't have now. I mean, if there something, I just wonder if we could kind of tease him out. 

00:31:00
ANN MARY I'm thinking companionship. 

00:31:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Companionship, how much are you together, I mean… I mean… 

00:31:10
ANN MARY Well. 

00:31:10
WILLIAM GLASSER 650 miles do you spend weekends or what does it? 

00:31:15
ANN MARY Usually weekends, like every other weekend or other… 

00:31:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Every other weekend you'll be together… 

00:31:15
ANN MARY Yeah, or every two weekends now, sometimes, this last time it was three, because I had some… 

00:31:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Does he come and live in your place with you, is that how it works? 

00:31:25
ANN MARY Yes. 

00:31:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. So it's a… it's a complete relationship actually everything and… 

00:31:30
ANN MARY Yes. 

00:31:30
WILLIAM GLASSER …and… and then when he leaves, like the other weekend. He leave… he leaves Sunday night, I suppose, or something like that, well how he gets there, but he leaves. 

00:31:45
ANN MARY Yeah, he drives, okay. 

00:31:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He drives okay and then, may because you Monday I'm home and its okay and stuff like that. 

00:31:50
ANN MARY Exactly. 

00:31:50
WILLIAM GLASSER But what do you kind of feel or think how… how word to put it, when he leaves? 

00:31:55
ANN MARY You know it's the last time he left I felt kind of sad. 

00:32:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

00:32:00
ANN MARY Like oh I wish, if we had a great weekend, but the time before that I was like so glad you know to see him go, I was like glad to be going to work, so I didn't think that was a real good sign, but it's… it depends, if he is pressuring me, then it's not a… a good weekend. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Pressuring you to get married? 

00:32:20
ANN MARY Right, if he, if there is no pressure and everything, we don't even broke the subject than it's great. I have a wonderful time. 

00:32:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm and I can see exactly what you're saying, so there is what we, what I kind of suggested to you and you agreed a little bit of an element of control and he doesn't try to control, it's a good time. Let's just, what's his name. 

00:32:50
ANN MARY Chris. 

00:32:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Chris and you were together and it's just together and enjoying and making love and going to the movie or seeing a few friends, but when he starts talking about the… the feature with you… you get leery about that? Okay, unfortunately… fortunately or unfortunately, I don't know which it is, it's your life. 

00:33:15
ANN MARY And then I think if… if I blow this opportunity, I might never you know get this chance again and then, more my grandmother is telling me that, you know I don't want to grow old by myself and you know I'm going to regret it and you know I don't know, I just, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. 

00:33:30
WILLIAM GLASSER What is this opportunity that you're blowing? 

00:33:35
ANN MARY Well the chance to get married. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM GLASSER To get married. 

00:33:40
ANN MARY Right. 

00:33:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, alright and but how do you see the marriage right now as you say the chance to get married. Is what all is it, is it only the chance to be happy or is that the chance to be not happy, I mean, what are the chances in this things? 

00:34:00
ANN MARY Well, I'd have to relocate. 

00:34:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:34:00
ANN MARY And adjust to a whole different lifestyle, be away from my family. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Does this school you're working now, is it fairly satisfying work for you? 

00:34:10
ANN MARY Yes, I do. I enjoy it. 

00:34:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You like your principal and… 

00:34:15
ANN MARY Yes absolutely. So I wouldn't, you know it would be a whole different life change. 

00:34:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

00:34:20
ANN MARY So I don't… 

00:34:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You say he's thinking of resigning his job or whatever you're looking for a new job, in the area that you live there is probably very high employment right now and things like that. Has it ever occurred to him or do you ever suggested well, Chris, want you come up here for a while and try it. 

00:34:45
ANN MARY I don't think he would like it up here, because he lives in a very small town. You know they have like 2000 people and you know Chicago has six million and I don't think you know I… I just don't think he would… he would like it at all. 

00:35:00
WILLIAM GLASSER And how do you like the idea of living in a town of 2000 where everybody knows the kind of like that? 

00:35:05
ANN MARY I don't like it. 

00:35:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And these are things to consider, I mean, you have a lot of conquers on, but love doesn't conquer a lot of things and that's what you're kind of telling me and I'm kind of agreeing with you. I mean your grandmother and others say, oh, she ought to be married you know and ought to have a family. 

00:35:30
ANN MARY What's wrong with her. 

00:35:30
WILLIAM GLASSER She has met a nice man and we've not and he's a nice guy and all that, but… 

00:35:35
ANN MARY And then they keep asking me what's wrong with you, and I'm thinking and maybe there is something wrong, I don't… I don't know. You know I… 

00:35:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You can also say maybe there is something right with me too, something about you say as, I could be getting into a difficult situation. 

00:35:50
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:35:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And in other words he saying come and live in my house and you have… you have already convinced you that the idea of him leaving that small town, where what does he down there? What he do for living? 

00:36:05
ANN MARY He owned a mechanic shop. 

00:36:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Does he cowl new cars and fix them? 

00:36:10
ANN MARY Yeah, hmm… hmm. 

00:36:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Does he read books? 

00:36:15
ANN MARY No, he doesn't. 

00:36:20
WILLIAM GLASSER I… I… I not, many mechanics do. I mean, they occasionally read about the mechanic philosopher and everything, but whether they that… they what do you talk about, when you, have you visited him, spend time, anytime? 

00:36:30
ANN MARY I've… I've spend time there in the summer. 

00:36:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

00:36:35
ANN MARY And it was nice, but it was more or less like you're on vacation, it's not. 

00:36:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Wasn’t real? 

00:36:40
ANN MARY Correct. 

00:36:45
WILLIAM GLASSER So what do you talk about when you're with him like for a several months in the summer? How long you've been seeing him? 

00:36:50
ANN MARY Since June, in the beginning of June. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay it's not that long. 

00:36:50
ANN MARY No. 

00:36:50
WILLIAM GLASSER So you saw him last summer where it amounted to a little bit. 

00:36:55
ANN MARY Basically. 

00:36:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay and then probably he has a certain yeah, there is a certain attraction, physical chemistry whatever you say reasonably good between you. 

00:37:05
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. Oh, yeah, absolutely. But it’s like, I don't know, it's like when he's gone, it's like I really kind of don't miss him. 

00:37:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

00:37:15
ANN MARY I don't know that's terrible to say. But it's… 

00:37:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Why? 

00:37:15
ANN MARY Because it is… 

00:37:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Not to your grandmother. You can say it to me. 

00:37:20
ANN MARY I know… I know, but it's like I get back in my own routine and my own world and you know if I don't hear from him another week, that's fine. 

00:37:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You won't sit at night, earning for the phone to ring? 

00:37:35
ANN MARY No… no, and sometimes I'm annoyed when he calls. If I'm in the middle of something and… 

00:37:40
WILLIAM GLASSER When he calls what does he say. 

00:37:40
ANN MARY He just said he loves me and he misses me and what am I doing and… 

00:37:45
WILLIAM GLASSER It's a pretty standard conversation. 

00:37:45
ANN MARY Yeah, hmm… hmm. 

00:37:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Right, there is never anything you're exciting. 

00:37:55
ANN MARY No… no. Not. 

00:37:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean… I mean, I'm just. I'm trying to kind of have you be at least relatively honest with yourself. 

00:38:10
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:38:10
WILLIAM GLASSER That your grandmother is not going to marry. Your mother is not going to marry him and you know have any sisters or bothers, but your cousins aren't going to marry him or anything like that, you're going to marry him and you're going to move to a small town and I presume as a teacher getting a masters degree that you have some intellectual interest that, it's not like you want to desperate to have a family together, because I don't think he has that desperate to have children either, is he? 

00:38:35
ANN MARY Here, I think he would like another trail, but… 

00:38:40
WILLIAM GLASSER It's not a desperation thing. 

00:38:40
ANN MARY No… no, but he said that would be my call, but I don't know. I just don't know, I mean I've had a lot of disappointment in the past and I've been around a lot of bad relationships in my life growing up I've seen you know. 

00:38:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Uncles, aunts and cousins and… 

00:38:55
ANN MARY grandmother and grandfather and everything and I don't, oh yeah they did. I mean I remember I didn't know that, I thought for the once time that married people weren't suppose to talk. I really thought that. 

00:39:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah… yeah now also they're not. 

00:39:10
ANN MARY I guess and I whenever go to my friends house. 

00:39:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Breaks the rules if they talk. 

00:39:15
ANN MARY Yeah. 

00:39:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Right. 

00:39:15
ANN MARY And I went to one of my friends house and like her parents were speaking to each other and I was amazed because I didn't, do you know that's how my family was, I didn't know they talked. 

00:39:25
WILLIAM GLASSER You're an only child with the mother and father who didn't talk a great deal either? 

00:39:30
ANN MARY Eh, no, my parents were divorced when I was very young and we've lived with my grandmother and my grandfather, my mom and I did. 

00:39:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. 

00:39:35
ANN MARY And they didn't talk at all. 

00:39:35
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't have any real big long term closes with your father then has… 

00:39:40
ANN MARY No not at all. 

00:39:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I see. And your mother hasn't re-married? 

00:39:45
ANN MARY No, she has and she is married a wonderful man and you know… 

00:39:50
WILLIAM GLASSER They talked? 

00:39:50
ANN MARY Yeah they do, they talked. 

00:39:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Good… good… good. 

00:39:50
ANN MARY They have you know good a good marriage. 

00:39:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:39:55
ANN MARY I think, now, but they have had their rough spots and… 

00:39:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Well everybody has their rough spots, but compared to you grandparents. 

00:40:00
ANN MARY My grandmother and my grandfather. 

00:40:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, its pretty good. 

00:40:05
ANN MARY Yeah, exactly and are you know I don't know if it's just there are example that, I don't know. 

00:40:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well it's good that you don't know. What so hurry? 

00:40:20
ANN MARY Well it's, I feel like you know I also try and please people and I feel like I would me making everybody happy if I just did this, but I don't know. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, everybody has your life kind of potted out for you a little bit. You are a 35 years old and people probably have known you had unsatisfied relationships, they'd like to see what the call "settle down" 

00:40:45
ANN MARY Absolutely. 

00:40:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And all that stuff and… and I mean settle down doesn't sound that exciting to you. 

00:40:55
ANN MARY No it doesn't. 

00:41:00
WILLIAM GLASSER How about excitement, is there any excitement in your life I mean. 

00:41:05
ANN MARY Well my favorite thing in the world to do is travel. I want to see the world that's alright. 

00:41:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and you do it, if you done it has a teacher. Teachers are nice travelers summers and things. 

00:41:10
ANN MARY Yeah, I've spent out of the country three times and I've enjoyed and I just, it's like I just love to you… you know go see exotic places and you know were just two different things and that is like what I wanted to do, actually is see the world. 

00:41:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you… do you travel. You have traveled three times out of the country and have traveled in the country each year. 

00:41:35
ANN MARY Right. Hmm… hmm. 

00:41:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you travel by yourself or with others? 

00:41:40
ANN MARY I usually go by myself because… 

00:41:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You need people, though don't you? 

00:41:40
ANN MARY Right. I… what I usually do is if I hook up with the… with the travel group overseas and my friends are married or you know divorced or whatever and they don't, you know, it's expensive to go overseas. I have no dependents, so it's easier for me. 

00:42:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Right… right. 

00:42:00
ANN MARY So what I usually do is, I'll book a trip and… and me like a tour group over you know… 

00:42:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And on the group you can find people. You're looking for friends, you… you find. 

00:42:05
ANN MARY Oh, it's great, I mean, it's absolutely wonderful. Everybody feels sorry for me that I do this by myself and it's like if you don't pick the right traveling partner they could bring you whole trip. 

00:42:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, yeah. 

00:42:20
ANN MARY So with the group, it's like you have friends when you want them and people to do things, but if you want to go do something on your own, it's you have that option, I've always enjoyed it. 

00:42:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Have you ever hooked up with a love relationship on a trip? 

00:42:30
ANN MARY No. 

00:42:30
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not saying it's easy I just wondered if you had that’s all. 

00:42:35
ANN MARY Not overseas, no. So… 

00:42:40
WILLIAM GLASSER When you're going with this guy now your.. your home alone sometimes two or three things at a time you're telling me, do you ever look at anybody else? 

00:42:50
ANN MARY Eh, I've thought about it. I don't. 

00:42:55
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not saying who have had a friend, just looking to think about other people. 

00:42:55
ANN MARY Yeah, I mean, there have been you know time I've went out, I've totally denied. I'm, I have somebody in my life you know and I don't know why I did that, but… 

00:43:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Let you did. 

00:43:10
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:43:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You didn't feel terrible about it? 

00:43:15
ANN MARY Not at all. So I thought when maybe, it's not honest thing to do, but I…I don't know, you know I've never, you know. 

00:43:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You're kind of going steady with him, but you're not wearing engagement ring right now, is that what you're saying? 

00:43:25
ANN MARY Right. Well, he did give me a ring, but… 

00:43:30
WILLIAM GLASSER But you're not wearing? 

00:43:30
ANN MARY Correct. 

00:43:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. I mean, it couldn't hurt him by turning it down I gather whatever, what happen with the ring, that's interesting. 

00:43:35
ANN MARY Well, he told me he wanted me to wear it and my, well he wanted me to wear on my left hand and you know I said I wasn't ready to be… 

00:43:45
WILLIAM GLASSER That's an engagement right on your left hand. 

00:43:45
ANN MARY Right. Engaged, so he told me he wanted me to keep it and keep it as a gift from him and I can wear it on my right hand, if I wanted to. 

00:43:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Is it, it's not a terribly expensive thing. Is it? 

00:44:00
ANN MARY It's a diamond ring I'm not it's… it's nice. 

00:44:00
WILLIAM GLASSER It's nice, okay… okay… okay so it's a… it's a… it's a ring that if you wanted to wear, you would be ashamed of wearing it like that. 

00:44:10
ANN MARY No… no. It's very pretty. 

00:44:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Alright. That's good. 

00:44:10
ANN MARY But, I… 

00:44:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you keep in the… in the box right now. 

00:44:15
ANN MARY Right I wish I wouldn't have taken it though because then it kind of… 

00:44:20
WILLIAM GLASSER To the little bit of a lock in there. 

00:44:20
ANN MARY Right. I wish I would have you know have the presence of mind to save, you know I don't think this is a good idea, but at the time I didn't and… and so and I… 

00:44:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well at the time you were in that frame of mind which is well, I mean, how can I hurt this poor guy or something or… 

00:44:35
ANN MARY Yeah, that's mean, oh he'll… he'll be questioned if I don't you know. 

00:44:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:44:40
ANN MARY So I'm… I'm I don't really wear it as much. You know usually if he is around I wear it, but you know on my own, I don't really don't. 

00:44:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Human beings have a variety of needs, that's one of thing that I teach one of the needs is freedom. Do you think that your need for freedom is kind of something that's important to you? 

00:45:05
ANN MARY Absolutely. 

00:45:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. It sounds that way to me that everything you've talked about is it, I mean, that's on, don't fence me in, and you remember… 

00:45:10
ANN MARY Yeah. 

00:45:15
WILLIAM GLASSER You look like the kind of person that doesn't wants to me fenced in and… and Chicago doesn't fence and this is kind of a big place and you go here and there. 

00:45:25
ANN MARY But I don't you know I don't know, he's… he's a wonderful guy and he is great to me and I just don't understand why I'm so hesitant. 

00:45:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Well I think, we've… we've, I think you've explained I guess about this clear as you can or you're so hesitant? Next one thing to see him in every other weekend or every weekend and so another thing, when you with him a lot of the time, I said, in this summer you were with him for about a month or something, how long were you with him down there. 

00:46:00
ANN MARY About three weeks. 

00:46:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Three weeks and… and that was in the beginning of the relationship too. 

00:46:05
ANN MARY Right. 

00:46:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And that's when things were sexually hot and all that kind of… 

00:46:10
ANN MARY Yeah, everything is got them sunshine. 

00:46:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah… yeah. 

00:46:15
ANN MARY So, I don't know and then I feel bad if it doesn't work out and it's like I'm kind of that a lose… lose situation here, you know, if I do ended I will lose it, if I do marry I'm in hated I lose you know so I don't know. 

00:46:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Had you ever had a win… win situation in your relationship? 

00:46:35
ANN MARY No. I've never had… either so. 

00:46:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:46:40
ANN MARY I really would know you know. 

00:46:40
WILLIAM GLASSER This is as far as the personal treatment of this man by you this is about as good as you've had, this what you say. 

00:46:45
ANN MARY Oh, yeah, absolutely. 

00:46:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay… Okay and… and you're certainly not in a huge hurry out here. 

00:46:55
ANN MARY No. 

00:46:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Presume perhaps, lets you say that… that you've got time for this masters degree, let's say you want to get it, because if you go to work down south with the masters degree, it will help you get a better job, the pay scale is considerably low and then around Chicago, it's really high and thing, but the living maybe cheaper down there too. I don't really know. But project yourself a little bit toward this summer, let's say that we're in right now if 1st of March and somewhere would be you're through school about right there first week in June or something like that, you got your tripe projected for this summer. 

00:47:40
ANN MARY Eh, I'm thinking of going to Poland. 

00:47:40
WILLIAM GLASSER With your family Polish… 

00:47:45
ANN MARY I have Polish descendants, but there is this, there is group go over volunteers where they go around and they do service projects and they want to go into Poland and I would like to do that. 

00:47:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Would they appear away or would you? 

00:47:55
ANN MARY No, you pay because basically what you're doing is you're helping fund the project. 

00:48:00
WILLIAM GLASSER I see… I see. 

00:48:00
ANN MARY But basically you up, you know, they give you housing. 

00:48:00
WILLIAM GLASSER But your… your taxes will be deductible and shared and all that. 

00:48:05
ANN MARY Exactly. Hmm… hmm. 

00:48:05
WILLIAM GLASSER So you get a point of and… and you'd be with the group of people like yourself that want to help people would the all teachers, it would be necessarily teachers. 

00:48:10
ANN MARY Not necessarily teachers, there is people from different walks of life who you know. 

00:48:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Would you be living at a small town or big town or what? 

00:48:20
ANN MARY Probably a small town over there, but you, they have excursions and stuff to the big cities and to see things. 

00:48:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, there is lot of cultural or things in Poland and nice life. 

00:48:30
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:48:30
WILLIAM GLASSER So that's pretty much you're going to do that idea. 

00:48:35
ANN MARY I'm really. I'm about 90% sure. 

00:48:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay… okay. And this goes along with things you enjoy and what would that be, about other three or four weeks down there? 

00:48:45
ANN MARY Probably about three weeks. 

00:48:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Eh… eh. 

00:48:50
ANN MARY So… 

00:48:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Well you know it's… it's something that like you say 90% sure is a lots of pretty good chance it will happen and I doubt if, Chris would be terribly against to them, I mean, if you wanted it. 

00:49:05
ANN MARY No, he… 

00:49:05
WILLIAM GLASSER No he would be supportive of it, I'm sure. But what just seem to me to be interesting kind of you say you're in a possibly a lose-lose situation, and then knew I… I got lose him or if I marry him, I could get a bad marriage, so it's… it's a tough situation and to be cautions it's certainly a wise thing to do, but how about thinking just kind of thinking about this summer spending another three weeks with him down there with a, it's not as much of a hot and heavy thing as it was the first time. 

00:49:45
ANN MARY I've thought that too. 

00:49:50
WILLIAM GLASSER What could you lose? 

00:49:50
ANN MARY Yeah, I've thought of that too that would you know, it have probably what I should do. But for some reason in my head I'm like surprised it's lasted this long and I keep wondering if it's going to last until sometime. 

00:50:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, it doesn't last or some or then you will do it. 

00:50:05
ANN MARY Right. 

00:50:05
WILLIAM GLASSER So that's not a big problem. But let's say last so summer you have a nice tripe to Poland and that will be enjoyable and it seems to me that you're getting into something I don't think that you'd like to marry and then have the marriage fail… 

00:50:25
ANN MARY Exactly. 

00:50:25
WILLIAM GLASSER But it just seems to me that since there is no urgency or you're not ticking in a biological clock or all that kind of the thing that, a few weeks with him, the second summer, trying your best really to… to see the good the points of it, but trying to keep your eyes open to this, the three weeks it was be them, that's very well a great, a good example of what life is going to be like. 

00:50:55
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:50:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And I'm I thinking if he is a probably or reasonably good mechanic if he makes a living down there, but there is probably, that he has his own shopper… 

00:51:05
ANN MARY Right. 

00:51:05
WILLIAM GLASSER …but he's thinking he's selling it your saying. 

00:51:10
ANN MARY Right. 

00:51:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You know it's a big deal. But I think you have a kind of a mild obligation to suggest to him that we have a lot going for us, but I don't know if I could make in that small town, what you think about moving here, you can get all the mechanics in Chicago. I mean, he… he walks in any place in Chicago if he can do anything they're going to hire him today, there is just. 

00:51:35
ANN MARY Yeah. 

00:51:35
WILLIAM GLASSER There is… there is just know it's like teachers, it's not hard to get a teaching job today and it's hard to get a job as a… as a mechanic I mean they have you know… you know when you go to heavier car repair to 60 dollars in hours, so there is… there is money in it to. I don't say they pay him 60 dollars. 

00:51:55
ANN MARY No, but… 

00:51:55
WILLIAM GLASSER But I mean… 

00:51:55
ANN MARY That's yeah. 

00:51:55
WILLIAM GLASSER You… you're talking about a man that would make 25, 30 bucks an hour, if he knows what he is doing. So that's about what you make as a teacher, I mean, it's… 

00:52:05
ANN MARY Right, compliable. 

00:52:05
WILLIAM GLASSER It's… it's compliable, yeah. When on more instance when you see each other and I… I just… I just have that sense that marriage is such a tough situation. 

00:52:20
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:52:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And you're seeing so many people like to the point, we didn't know they even talk to each other, you know, you're… you're being very honest. It's just, as much information as you can possibly have before it's not good to find things out after you get married, it's better than never finding him out at all, if they're going to be unhappy, but still… 

00:52:40
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:52:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you understand where I'm driving, I mean, I've seen your life. 

00:52:45
ANN MARY Yes. 

00:52:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And I don't feel, I feel very hesitant, but I feel also kind of obligated to… to kind of put myself a little but in your shoes and help you to think this thing true that's what counselors do. 

00:52:55
ANN MARY Right. It's, see that's when I mean, its like nobody is, people just see that you know I'm passing up those opportunity nobody, I don't know. 

00:53:10
WILLIAM GLASSER If you can only live your own life, nobody can live for it, let's so there and be kind, everything it's your life. And if the good times come they're going to enjoy it, if the bad times come, not going bother them at all. You know, your own grandmother would say, well, you made your bed, live in it you know but you don't want to live in it, you know what I'm, it's tough. 

00:53:30
ANN MARY Exactly, so… 

00:53:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And if we could run through all the things that you expressed to me in this relatively short interview, we'd find that there is a lot of reasonable concerns, and… 

00:53:40
ANN MARY So you don't think I'm commitment phobic or… 

00:53:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I don't… I don't believe in that. I believe you're being cautious, so I believe you other need for freedom maybe a little more than the average person. 

00:53:50
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:53:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And you can't, you know some women all they want, we work with them all they want is a family and a husband and children and they just live for it. You're not one of those kind of women. 

00:54:10
ANN MARY No… no, I'm not. 

00:54:10
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, you can't and those are the kind of people who are giving you the advice. 

00:54:15
ANN MARY Yeah. 

00:54:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, you're… you're getting advice for a buyer sector, I mean, I'm not saying they're bad people. 

00:54:20
ANN MARY No. 

00:54:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You know I mean, you'd need some, I mean, but I'm trying to every counselor gives advice, you can't help but give it where every word I say to you is… is a word that I, a word that I'm trying to… to say to you so that you'll evaluate your life is… is reasonably easy as you can and you know we're not dealing with an emergency here, isn't like this guy is saying it will, if you don't do it next week, it's all over or anything like that. 

00:54:50
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:54:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and if have something you know, I'm sure, as compared to what you've had pretty good, but I would see… I would be cautious about the pressure. I can see him putting pressure and you're… you're… you… you… you're reasonably nice person and he also sees you as a, I can't, maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think he sees you cries he on the way is a confident person, does he see was component? 

00:55:25
ANN MARY Yes. 

00:55:25
WILLIAM GLASSER You can deal with things, I mean, here goes your house, it's in order, your cars there, you have friends, you have a life, I mean it's, you're not like at lose ends. 

00:55:35
ANN MARY Right, exactly. 

00:55:40
WILLIAM GLASSER In fact, if you could say that you are tide and so fell about. 

00:55:40
ANN MARY Yes, exactly. 

00:55:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and but okay. It's okay. I mean, as a… as a counselor, I don't see many people like you, I mean, it's, I don't see people who come in here who… who were looking at their life and they're saying I'm not going to live it just the way other people say and I'm not, you're not crying to me, you're not wheeling and you're not you know, you are saying yourself, you're talk they little like it to me a person who is a reasonable person. 

00:56:15
ANN MARY Well thank you. You're the first person that's told me that… 

00:56:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Well I haven't heard anything unreasonable form my standpoint. Now, I… I'm… I'm older than you are and it's not… it's not my life I'm trying to get you lead or anything like that, but marriage is the biggest step a person makes in life I think. 

00:56:40
ANN MARY Right. 

00:56:40
WILLIAM GLASSER And then, after marriage the next biggest step is whether we should have a family and not but, most people and you'd be that kind of a person they wanted to get married before you have the family, you're not were some girls in your school saying if I don't get pregnant by 35 I won't get pregnant anyway, I mean, you here that all around, but that's not you. 

00:56:55
ANN MARY No, you know sometimes, I… I work with kids all day, sometimes I come home and it's quiet and I'm just so happy. I think, you know, I mean I love kids, but if it doesn't happen that's fine. 

00:57:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

00:57:10
ANN MARY I don't feel there is some biological need… 

00:57:10
WILLIAM GLASSER What age do you teach? 

00:57:15
ANN MARY Third grade, sixth and seven. 

00:57:15
WILLIAM GLASSER But you're teaching little kids and… 

00:57:15
ANN MARY Right, so… 

00:57:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and… and, so it's like you're not hungry for little kids. 

00:57:20
ANN MARY No, it's… 

00:57:25
WILLIAM GLASSER It's that they just past the day brings day its practically would you have them, but… 

00:57:25
ANN MARY Right. 

00:57:25
WILLIAM GLASSER But they look up to you and they kind of say I might worship you if you treat them pretty well. 

00:57:30
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:57:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You get along with them, okay? 

00:57:30
ANN MARY Yeah I do, I have a… I have a good relationship, but majority of them. 

00:57:35
WILLIAM GLASSER How about their parents? 

00:57:40
ANN MARY Eh, unfortunately, we do… we don’t get a lot of parental support, but the parents I did meet I… I… I like, and they seem to like me, so. 

00:57:45
WILLIAM GLASSER So you don't work in a very elite school or… 

00:57:50
ANN MARY No… no, not at all. 

00:57:50
WILLIAM GLASSER It's a middle class neighborhood problems. 

00:57:50
ANN MARY Right and I do… I do special education, so… 

00:57:55
WILLIAM GLASSER So you're doing with some of the kids that have a few of what they call the AS and the DS and those kind of kids. 

00:58:00
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm and a lot of them are very needy, you know. 

00:58:05
WILLIAM GLASSER At the end of the day sometimes you're glad to see him go, you know. 

00:58:10
ANN MARY Its, yeah. Some days it's just exhausting, because… 

00:58:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Glad to see him comment, glad to see him go, almost like your boyfriend over the weekend. 

00:58:15
ANN MARY Yeah exactly. So I don't know, I guess, I'm just looking for somebody to tell me what to do when I know him, but he's going to tell me that, but… 

00:58:20
WILLIAM GLASSER No I am telling a few things to you, I'm telling you check it out, check out how you feel, be honest. Not being mean, I mean, check out the wedding ring is in the box, and I mean the occasion ring is in the box. 

00:58:35
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:58:35
WILLIAM GLASSER If he puts too much pressure on me happy to see him go. If he doesn’t call some week, it's okay with me, is that being selfish, I don't know. Is it your job to be the mother of the guy or I mean… 

00:58:55
ANN MARY Either, I don't know that's what a, and then I feel like, well may be I'm not really doing this guy any favors if I'm not planning on making that long term commitment, maybe I should let him go and be with somebody in his own backyard you know who he could spend all those time what… 

00:59:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Something that I agree I'm talked about that, but now they bring it up, it's something to think about too. 

00:59:10
ANN MARY So I think you know, maybe I'm not doing him any good. I don't know, you know, I just. 

00:59:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Well he's still coming up and driving the distance and… 

00:59:20
ANN MARY No. 

00:59:25
WILLIAM GLASSER He not, you're not forcing, you're not begging him, so… 

00:59:25
ANN MARY No… no, not at all. 

00:59:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And maybe it's possibly you're the first person of your background with an education and… and… and getting a masters degree that he's ever been intimate with for all… 

00:59:35
ANN MARY Yeah, I think… yeah, I think, that's probally then you know a lot to do with and I'm different. 

00:59:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Is he graduated high school? 

00:59:40
ANN MARY No. 

00:59:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He hasn't graduated high school, I was figuring that. But he was one of those guys that hand your own cars, and all those southern guys that put these car together be the boot like runs and they're really good at it, you know. 

00:59:55
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

00:59:55
WILLIAM GLASSER …this kind of stuff and so, is he drinking then? 

01:00:00
ANN MARY No… no, not. 

01:00:00
WILLIAM GLASSER That's a… that's a pretty positive sign and he's a gentleman. 

01:00:05
ANN MARY Very much so. 

01:00:05
WILLIAM GLASSER How did you get along with these kids? 

01:00:05
ANN MARY See now that bothers me too, because my family were… were overly close. I mean, they… you know. 

01:00:10
WILLIAM GLASSER If you grandparents, they were close to they and talk. 

01:00:15
ANN MARY Right. But they're like close with me, you know. 

01:00:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah… yeah… yeah… yeah. 

01:00:20
ANN MARY He's not close… 

01:00:20
WILLIAM GLASSER They're married to you? 

01:00:20
ANN MARY Right. 

01:00:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:00:20
ANN MARY He's not really close, with his kids, hardly at all it's like you know I don't know, I don't give it. 

01:00:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And the mother is dead. 

01:00:30
ANN MARY Right so. 

01:00:30
WILLIAM GLASSER How about… how about his parents, are they around? 

01:00:35
ANN MARY They are around, they're divorced. 

01:00:35
WILLIAM GLASSER You are not close to them either particularly? 

01:00:35
ANN MARY I don't think so, I think… 

01:00:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't talk about a much. 

01:00:40
ANN MARY No I think he see us mom and you know, I know he has a good relationship with his dad, but like, his sons it's like I don't know the one can't just leave and go somewhere and he was going to be gone a month and like he had thought that he left already and I'm like for wouldn't he say good bye before you left and he's right now, not necessarily and I just found that so hard because you know I wouldn't leave until I said good bye to my mom and dad if I was going somewhere for a long, extended period of time and I'm 35, but they don't feel that. 

01:01:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Where is considerable differences in background, education, personality… 

01:01:15
ANN MARY Yeah, hmm… hmm. 

01:01:20
WILLIAM GLASSER The thing is, you haven't had a guy that's really nice and gentle and luxury and… and yeah and but he is a loving man, when he is loving and all that and, but how long love can keep something going without, see this is just been my experience and I don't know that marriage is a tough deal, you've obviously seen it's a tough deal and your mom finally, as a quiet a grown women has finally found a… a better marriage is that right? 

01:01:45
ANN MARY Right. 

01:01:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And that's good and I'm happy that she has, but has she married a man that has some… some similarities to her. 

01:02:00
ANN MARY Yeah, hmm…. hmm. They work together and you know… 

01:02:00
WILLIAM GLASSER You have things in common. 

01:02:05
ANN MARY Right. 

01:02:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, okay and they like their… their friends at they see, it's a… 

01:02:10
ANN MARY Were absolutely. 

01:02:10
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and okay. I'm just wondering that this kind of a thing of… 

01:02:15
ANN MARY Well, that's what my mom tells me that, we might not have enough in common. 

01:02:20
WILLIAM GLASSER So your mom isn't pushing for this… 

01:02:25
ANN MARY No, at first she was, but now she's kind of like, oh, I think yet you know don't listen to your grandmother and you know she's 82, she you know don't listen to anybody, you know she just said it's… it's my decision she said. 

01:02:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And your mom is there either the closest person to you. 

01:02:40
ANN MARY Right. 

01:02:40
WILLIAM GLASSER From what I gather. 

01:02:40
ANN MARY She would like me to get married and she said she would be happy but she said… 

01:02:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I think that you don't, yeah, I mean your… your… your mom is selling it be cautions. 

01:02:50
ANN MARY Right. 

01:02:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Which is a good mom should. And they first you went along with a common thing, but then she detected that maybe this girl she'd be more careful. Talk to your mom more about like you're talking to me, talk to her. 

01:03:05
ANN MARY I do, I talk to her all the time about it, because I just, I don't know, I… I you know I thought for the longest time it was me and no one thinking maybe it's not, but it's… 

01:03:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Well this you, but there is nothing wrong with you being you? 

01:03:20
ANN MARY Yeah, you don't think? 

01:03:20
WILLIAM GLASSER No… no, you're not telling me anything that makes me in any way feel uncomfortable talking or hearing, I mean, to be very honest you mean you were you, I mean, I don't like I'm a counselor, I don't see many people who are kind of concern because they're almost two together. 

01:03:45
ANN MARY Well thank you. I just, I don't know, you know I feel like either way. 

01:03:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, talk to your mom and think about what we've talked about and… 

01:03:55
ANN MARY I will, it's, I will, I think. 

01:03:55
WILLIAM GLASSER And if your time come in time when you know you could talk again, I suppose, it could work out. But I think you know that I'm, we've had a good talk, I've enjoyed it. 

01:04:05
ANN MARY I've too and, you don't think I'm commitment phobic or… 

01:04:10
WILLIAM GLASSER I don't go for that kind of stuff. 

01:04:15
ANN MARY Okay. 

01:04:15
WILLIAM GLASSER You know, I mean, there is a lot of commitment phoebes in this world and a lot we should be commitment phoebes, this way at least they only make themselves miserable nobody else. 

01:04:25
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:04:25
WILLIAM GLASSER So I don't know, I wouldn't worry that much about it. Anyway, great talking to you. 

01:04:30
ANN MARY You too, thank you very much doctor. 

01:04:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

01:04:35
JON CARLSON Well, I really enjoyed this interview with Ann Mary, watching you work, is this a good example of your approach to brief therapy. 

01:04:45
WILLIAM GLASSER It's a very good example in my approach to therapy, not my approach to brief therapy because I only do therapy one way whether it turns out to be brief or it turns out to be long, that's up to the problem itself, but I make new, and… and there is no difference to me and how I approach here, I approach each client as if this may be the last time I'll ever see this person. I got to go as far as I can during this time. 

01:05:05
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. And where would you go next with Ann Mary, if… if you were to see here in a future visit? 

01:05:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean, when I left here, in my mind I said, this doesn't require me to ask her to come back. I would have said, you have my number Ann Mary and see how things work out and if you want to talk to me again, I'd be happy to talk to you. But I would again talk to her about the conflict in your mind, between independence and getting married, the conflict between is this the right guy or isn't it and her view of marriage like grandparents that never spoke to each other, she thought marrying couples didn't speak. I mean, all these things, but it just went follow pretty much from this interview, that we've set the stage for and lets she comes up with a totally different problem. 

01:05:55
JON CARLSON It almost sounds like you wouldn't invite her back though immediately. 

01:06:00
WILLIAM GLASSER No… no. I didn't see. I told her to talk to your mom. 

01:06:05
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:06:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And I think she should talk to her mother because her mother was giving her now sensible advice and I'm not the only person in the world she can talk to. I mean, I think it's important for us to have good relationships and I encourage people to… to this is an improving relationship between her and her mother and the more she talks to her mother about this, now that there are kind under same wave length and more it's going to help her and the closer she is to her mother, the closer any daughter is to a mother with a good relationship the better off they are. So I'm little bit worried about her mental health and a kind of a little sense there you know. 

01:06:40
JON CARLSON Well, and this part of the program, now we're going to watch some clips of you work with Ann Mary. 

01:06:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

01:06:50
JON CARLSON And we're going to start right away with one that's about five minutes into the interview in which you've already began to look at here and her reluctant to move towards this man, lets watch this clip, because I'd be interested in your comments. 

01:07:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Fine. Possible to find out, but you know that there is a lot of good things about him, but there is some things about going ahead and following what he want, it bothers you but I'm not sure that you're not jumping? 

01:07:20
ANN MARY Right and I don't know why. 

01:07:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I mean, I think you have some idea. 

01:07:30
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:07:30
WILLIAM GLASSER If he is talk about the idea it could be better. I mean, I can't put words in your mouth, but something that bother, you know It's not a mystery, total mystery to you. 

01:07:35
ANN MARY Well know, it's, but he is… he was… was married for 22 years. 

01:07:40
WILLIAM GLASSER That is older than you right? 

01:07:45
ANN MARY Yeah, he's not a lot older, maybe he's six years. 

01:07:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Eh… eh okay, So you got married really young. 

01:07:50
ANN MARY Right. 

01:07:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Is your family. 

01:07:50
ANN MARY He's got two kids who are pretty much grown, ones like 21 the other is 18. 

01:08:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, kids aren't the factor then? 

01:08:00
ANN MARY No… no. 

01:08:00
JON CARLSON Bill, in this peace you jump right in with saying it's not a mystery to you. How did you know that? 

01:08:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I know anybody's life is a mystery to him. They know what's going on, they don't want to face it. I think there is only one really serious problem that people have, all people in the world and that's getting along well with the important people in their life or maybe even having nobody they're getting along with, but most people have someone and so, she knows that she's having a problem with this guy and but she doesn’t want to face it, because to face it, it's little difficult. So my job is to help her to face the problem and I knew what it was when she walked in the door, I didn't know was this particular thing, but I knew she had a relationship problem, she's 35 years old, what could it be. Probably not her mother or father unlikely her children and unlikely her neighbor or boss. It's going to be with a man. 

01:08:55
JON CARLSON But she things it's a mystery to her though, doesn't she is no way she has come to counseling. 

01:09:00
WILLIAM GLASSER She thinks it is, but I'm going to help her to understand it isn't and she understood it pretty quickly so, it wasn't like we had a tease out a deeply hidden repressed problem, because I don't think such a things really exist, but certainly they didn't exist in here. 

01:09:20
DIANE KJOS That seems to be a pretty common thing, that people come in and say and I just don't know why it's this way and… 

01:09:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well sometimes I'm really quiet straight forward, I wasn't here cases. 

01:09:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:09:30
WILLIAM GLASSER So the well, you've come in to the right place, I know I… 

01:09:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:09:35
WILLIAM GLASSER …and that really they really kind of gets things going, I mean, there is no such beating around the bush, there would be time is valuable. 

01:09:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:09:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You know I didn't say that in her case, but just as a generally, I know why and I've been in practice for over 30 years and thought people for even longer than that and work in all kinds of places, I've never seen any other problem other than inability to get the kind of relationships we want. Now, I'm not saying other problems don't exist, I'd never seen them. I've talked to some psychiatrist friends of mine and they agree, they've never seen them either. So that's what we're to focus on. Why buzz around on other things. 

01:10:10
JON CARLSON At this point in the interview you… you restarting together a lot of data. 

01:10:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:10:15
JON CARLSON I mean, you're finding out that her boyfriend is older than her and then you find out shortly that there is educational differences. 

01:10:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Right. 

01:10:20
JON CARLSON And there is regional differences and he has been married and has kids. What does this mean to you, getting all of this data? 

01:10:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I'm not gathering data chart, and in a certain sense, I'm gathering data what we would say a better we're gathering data, she is hearing the words coming out, I'm listening and nodding and nodding and nodding so she is hearing it but I'm interested in… in what she's saying because everything that she said was important in to her problem and the data is that when you get married you should be pretty sure that you've got pretty good compatibility. Marriage is harden up with total compatibility when you're going in. She had maybe five, six, seven, things that would be red flagged to me. 

01:11:05
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:11:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And red flagged to any human being would hear this. Since there are not, there is no mystery here. She just had to hear it, that's it. 

01:11:10
JON CARLSON Eh, eh. 

01:11:10
DIANE KJOS In a way you're kind of helping her make a list. 

01:11:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, that's right and then I went over, I ticked off the list, I think at the end kind of a little bit. I mean, she left with a feeling I think that not that she learned so much but that she kind of was more willing to face the stuff that was really on her mind and it wasn't any mystery. 

01:11:35
JON CARLSON We're going to move along just a little bit further in the interview now with the next clip we're going to watch and in this next clip, you're going to actually help Ann Mary to maybe figure out what this data means to her. So lets watch that. 

01:11:50
WILLIAM GLASSER You know about it. It's your independent you're going to loose a little bit, eh? 

01:11:55
ANN MARY Right. But now I'm… I'm deciding to why really like this independence thing or is it just a reason that I'm giving everybody for not wanting do you know to make a commitment. 

01:12:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well it's, you lets and well if any one can tell you that, but there is a reason. I mean, here the guy is kids are growing up and not depended on him does he make a fairly good living? 

01:12:20
ANN MARY Well see, that's what bothers me, I don't know because it's like, he's from the south and up in the mid-west here were very fast paced and we have sallow, I think he makes an okay living, but he doesn't really, his work ethics are totally different than… than mine or… or my family and I worry about that. 

01:12:40
WILLIAM GLASSER That's a difference. 

01:12:40
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:12:45
JON CARLSON As you're and tracking with her at that time, what's going on inside of you? 

01:12:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, what's going on inside of me is to find the positives and the negatives in this proposed relationships. I was very careful in talking about this man who I felt was not really very compatible with her. But I didn't want to go in any way put him down or anything because she did say, I've had the best relationship with any guy up till now. I mean, I just want to help her to, if you use my term, the reality of the situation and it that point we were, she came up with the thing, well, his… his, work ethic is very different from mine and work is an important part of people's life. 

01:13:25
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:13:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And married people talk a lot about their work and knowing counseling enough married couples who truthfully had different work ethics, it's… it's a… it's a… it's a… it's a problem. 

01:13:40
JON CARLSON How well, then you would, she was taking in this is over a mystery and you said no there… there is a reason and kind of forced her to look at this sir. 

01:13:50
WILLIAM GLASSER There is not mysteries about human being, they like to think there is a mystery, it gives us all a kind of little ego boost to think we're, I'm more mysterious than the next guy. But in terms of… of how people deal with each other relationships, you can read novels and plays and a Shakespeare, it's all the same, Soccer ties had the same thing. I mean, if… if there is anything different and I've never run across it, I do occasionally as soon as I brightened up in therapy say I… I get this I never really heard that one before that… that makes my day you know. 

01:14:20
JON CARLSON And new thing. 

01:14:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah… yeah. That's in the good. But it's still a big relationship problem, but sometimes, I can't think of an example, but sometimes it… it is kind of new and it's gets exciting. I… I think about it. 

01:14:30
DIANE KJOS And you are to say it's a little hard for her to talk about in… in any way that's negative she is like. 

01:14:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah and I don't want to encourage that. 

01:14:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah and I just a careful about that. 

01:14:40
JON CARLSON That may relate to the kind of person that she is. 

01:14:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:14:40
JON CARLSON And in this next clip we're going to watch, it's a clip in which you ask a question that's very leading, I think, it's are you a needy person, so lets watch that and we can come at shortly. 

01:14:55
ANN MARY Very comfortable with that idea for the last five years. 

01:14:55
WILLIAM GLASSER You don't consider yourself a real needy person then? 

01:15:00
ANN MARY No, I don't. 

01:15:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, I mean, you can take care of things. You had desperate to have a child today or tomorrow. 

01:15:05
ANN MARY No, I'm not even sure. 

01:15:10
WILLIAM GLASSER If biological clock is at the top of you mind now. 

01:15:10
ANN MARY No, I don’t no… no. 

01:15:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

01:15:15
ANN MARY So, but then… 

01:15:15
WILLIAM GLASSER So what does this guy, I… I mean tangibly what is he offer you that you don't have now. I mean, if there is something, I just wonder if we could kind of tease him out. Let me… let me, pick up on the last thing before this, the question, you asked your question that are you a needy person. 

01:15:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:15:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I don’t just ask a question for the sake of asking questions, I… I… I follow the lawyers advice, a good lawyer never ask a question that you don't know the answer to. 

01:15:50
DIANE KJOS Hmm… hmm. 

01:15:50
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:15:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Now once in a while like a lawyer I ready to answer them surprised, but I was totally un-surprised by almost everything she said, in this interview. And so, I was pretty sure, had she been a needy person or even thought she was a needy person, I wouldn't have asked that question. 

01:16:05
DIANE KJOS And that's… that's an important point, I think, to… to remember that. You know to not ask questions if you don't know the answer, because you get yourself in trouble. 

01:16:15
WILLIAM GLASSER It's so than you blow it but most the time you don't. 

01:16:15
JON CARLSON But it was so important for her to understand that she wasn't this pathetic person who better jump and take this guy. He is the you know the last one left and I think she was starting to if almost be a little desperate about this. 

01:16:30
WILLIAM GLASSER I could say I think Dr. Harrington my great teacher that I had for many years, I once said to him, well, Gia, he call himself Gia, what… what he have to have to do to be, what do you have to have or be to be a good therapist and he thought for a moment he says, just one thing. I said, what is it? You got to be in better shape than the client, and this one was in a pretty good shape. But then I here I could said, but that's not completely true, if the clients are better shape than you are the therapy just goes the other way. 

01:17:00
JON CARLSON You almost benefited from this one. 

01:17:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, really, I did feel that way. 

01:17:05
JON CARLSON As we move on to our next clip, what happens is she begins to describe maybe in a little bit more depths thanks to the way that you're setting this up about the pressure that she feels from other people and then in this clip we're going to watch, she begins to reveal the pressure that she feels from her boyfriend. Lets watch this. 

01:17:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and then when he leaves, like the other weekend. He leave… he leave Sunday night, I suppose, or something like that, well how he gets there, but he leaves. 

01:17:40
ANN MARY Yeah, he drives, okay. 

01:17:45
WILLIAM GLASSER He drives okay and then, maybe because you Monday on home and its okay. 

01:17:45
ANN MARY Exactly. 

01:17:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Its stuff like that. But what do you kind of feel or think or I don't know how word to put it, when he leaves? 

01:17:55
ANN MARY You know it's the last time he left I felt kind of sad. 

01:18:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:00
ANN MARY Like oh I wish, if we had a great weekend, but the time before that I was like so glad you know to see him go, I was like glad to be going to work, so I didn't think that was a real good sign, but it's… it depends, if he is pressuring me, then it's not a… a good weekend. 

01:18:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Pressuring you to get married? 

01:18:20
ANN MARY Right. If he, if there is no pressure and everything’s, we don't even broke the subject than it's great. I have a wonderful time. 

01:18:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

01:18:30
JON CARLSON With this hope pressuring thing, what… what happened inside of you when you heard that? 

01:18:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, you know I felt very concerned for the relationship because the only thing that I know of well maybe there is others, but the major thing that destroys relationships, I mean, this is a relation pulls them apart is pressure. 

01:18:50
JON CARLSON And so… 

01:18:50
WILLIAM GLASSER One person putting pressure on another person basically trying to tell the other person, how they should live their lives because I know what's right for you. This idea, if we could get rid of this idea in the world that I know what's right for you, the world will get incredibly better quickly but all the misery in the world is not caused by you know murdering people in course of that but they don't think it's murder, not just have to kill these people, because they don't think the right way, that's the problem and this pressure that's going on between this guy, he's trying to tell him now fit yourself into my snitch now you're in this little town in this south and we'll be happier ever after and she is thinking I don't want this and I'm just want to get her aware of it, I'm not saying it shouldn't happen, but I wanted to get aware of it, that pressure is bad. 

01:19:40
JON CARLSON It's not a parent's job though to try to maybe even a partner's job to try to help their partner at times? 

01:19:45
WILLIAM GLASSER It's… it's their job and they do a marvelous job, so that where have so many unhappy parent children and so many unhappy marriages. I mean, the job is well done, but it's the… that's the cause of misery pressure. 

01:19:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:20:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Think him, who… who is the one person that you never ever pressured to do anything and the only people for a life time we get along with from the time a little kids, my… my best friend, 55 years I've been close to this guy. We… we never tried to force the other person to do anything here she doesn’t want to do, we have disagreements, and that's okay. Do you go your way for well, I'll go mine, no problem. 

01:20:20
JON CARLSON So this… so this, was is probably a clue for you too, this lack of acceptance that she was getting from her family and from her partner that this might eventually work into one of your treatment suggestions. 

01:20:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I just thought of it now, I didn't think of it before know, but the concern was that she… she said I want my family, I like my family and in a certain sense they were putting pressure, and what was the pressure doing, the pressure was hurting the relationship between her and her grandmother, perhaps between her and her mother earlier, when the mother was putting pressure on, that's what she didn't want to lose. I don't think the guy was ever that important to her, but she was saying well maybe I got to marry this guy to make them happy, but that wasn't anything this girl, this young women sensitively she was… was going to do, sensible not sensitive, but maybe sensitive too. 

01:21:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:21:10
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:21:15
DIANE KJOS I was almost, there is a sense of almost too that's thinking of she is… she, he needs her. 

01:21:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, yeah. 

01:21:20
DIANE KJOS He's not saying it quiet that way, but I think that maybe part of her pool that he needs her. 

01:21:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And… and later at the end we've found out that the need this guy has maybe somewhat of a very temporary nature because when there is children who're leaving here I mean he says at the end, and well, he didn't even figure son was going away from and he didn't even know when he left and there are when and so this needing thing is a very kind of a thing you got to be careful of. They need you up to a point. 

01:21:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:21:50
WILLIAM GLASSER But up to a point, that point gets un-needy pretty quick if the relationship is… is too much pressure in it. 

01:22:00
JON CARLSON It seems like another one of those cases where someone form and… and meshed family falls for somebody from a detached family. 

01:22:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:22:10
JON CARLSON You mentioned that there weren't many surprises, but I was really surprised in this peace by her reaction of not missing this guy, I mean, kind of the… 

01:22:15
WILLIAM GLASSER I wasn't. 

01:22:20
JON CARLSON No? 

01:22:20
WILLIAM GLASSER No… no, I was… I was surprised when she said, I missed him when she went away the weekend and so I got a little bit of support my goodness if she misses him every week, and I maybe on the wrong track and then the next thing she says is, but boy last weekend I couldn't wait to see him go. 

01:22:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:22:35
WILLIAM GLASSER And then later she said, three or four weeks go, two, three weeks go by and I don't unhappy if he doesn't call, that's not what I call the kind of love that people you know have a love twist and die for him, you know… 

01:22:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:22:45
WILLIAM GLASSER It's not, it happen. 

01:22:45
JON CARLSON In this next piece we're going to watch, I think for me is a very good example of the suddenness with what you work and how it really helps people, in this she came in saying if I blow this opportunity you know and you very calmly said, the opportunity to be married or the opportunity to be happy? 

01:23:10
DIANE KJOS Hmm… hmm. 

01:23:10
JON CARLSON And let's watch how that work it. 

01:23:15
ANN MARY And when I think if… if I blow this opportunity, I might never you know get this chance again and then, more my grandmother is telling me that, you know I don't want to grow old by myself and you know I'm going to regret it and you know I don't know, I just, I don't know what I'm suppose to do. 

01:23:35
WILLIAM GLASSER What is this opportunity that you're blowing? 

01:23:35
ANN MARY Well the chance to get married. 

01:23:40
WILLIAM GLASSER To get married. 

01:23:40
ANN MARY Right. 

01:23:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, alright and but how do you see the marriage right now as you say the chance to get married. Is at all is it is only the chance to be happy or is that the chance to be not happy, I mean, what are the chances in this things? 

01:24:00
ANN MARY Well, I'd have to relocate. 

01:24:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:24:05
ANN MARY And adjust to a whole different life style be away from my family. 

01:24:10
WILLIAM GLASSER To the school you're working now, is it fairly satisfying work for you? 

01:24:10
ANN MARY Yes. I do. I enjoy it. 

01:24:15
WILLIAM GLASSER You like your principal and… 

01:24:15
ANN MARY Yes. Absolutely. So I wouldn't, you know it would be a whole different life change. 

01:24:20
JON CARLSON It's almost like this was a surprise to her you know that she was so locked into marriage or not marriage and then you brought out these? 

01:24:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Well I just heard something different, you listen to the tape and you hear it again, I mean, I don't think there is any secret we're listening and do it again. 

01:24:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:24:35
WILLIAM GLASSER But the point is when she said that I said to my self my goodness, she doesn't even have the concept of a happy marriage. 

01:24:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:24:45
WILLIAM GLASSER The… the best that she can get out of her marriage is not terribly unhappy and I mean that's what she was coming up with so I had to say to her, you know there… there were… were let's be concerned about her happiness here. Any fool can get married, I didn't say that, but I mean certainly that happens, but… but, any fool can… can get happily married and… and my job, my responsibility is to bring the awareness that you're much… much better off, a thousand times better off never to get married at all then enter into a… in to happy and an unhappy marriage, may the poll had said, do you had rather loved and lost, and never loved at all, but I'm not so sure in real life people would go along with that. 

01:25:25
JON CARLSON Well, asked you is by that. 

01:25:25
DIANE KJOS And… and… and she's, there is, when she talks about her work and so on, you can see that… that's in a she's really giving up her great deal. 

01:25:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:25:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah, there is a big loss that she is been contemplating there. 

01:25:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I think you said it exactly Diane when she talks about the guy, she goes dead. 

01:25:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:25:45
WILLIAM GLASSER When she talks about other things, that trip to Poland, the trip out of trip than she comes alive and I mean, so that's what… what worried me once she said she had a good weakened with the guy. I mean, I would happy she had it, goodness knows, but it's just… 

01:26:00
DIANE KJOS She can't go traveling alone anymore. 

01:26:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, her… her caution about getting locked up on a trip even with a friend and making sure that she can be free of people. I means she is cautious she won't she is okay. I was just helped her a little bit, but I was… I was enjoyed working with her. 

01:26:20
JON CARLSON We're going to jump ahead a little bit, almost ten minutes in the interview. And in this next clip we're going to watch, she begins to talk about this ring, you know this ring that she told. 

01:26:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:26:30
JON CARLSON And she didn't want this ring, but she was afraid that if she didn’t take it she was going to hurt this guy, which lead into you're helping her to realize how important freedom is to her, let's watch this. 

01:26:45
ANN MARY No… no I've never. You know. 

01:26:50
WILLIAM GLASSER You're kind of going steady with him, but you're not wearing engagement ring right now, is that what you're saying? 

01:26:50
ANN MARY Right, well, he did give me a ring, but… 

01:26:55
WILLIAM GLASSER But you're not wearing? 

01:26:55
ANN MARY Correct. 

01:26:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. I mean, it couldn't hurt him by turning it down I gather whatever, what… what happen with the ring, that's interesting. 

01:27:00
ANN MARY Well, he told me he wanted me to wear. It's on my, well he wanted me to wear on my left hand and you know I said I wasn't ready to be… 

01:27:10
WILLIAM GLASSER That's an engagement right on your left hand. 

01:27:15
ANN MARY Right. Engaged, so he told me he wanted me to keep it and keep it as a gift from him and I can wear it on my right hand, if I wanted to. 

01:27:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Is it, it's not a terribly expensive thing. Is it? 

01:27:25
ANN MARY It's a diamond ring I'm not it's… it's nice. 

01:27:30
WILLIAM GLASSER It's nice, okay… okay… okay so it's… its a… its a ring that if you wanted to wear, you would be ashamed of wearing it right? 

01:27:35
ANN MARY No… no. It's very pretty. 

01:27:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Alright. That's good. 

01:27:35
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. But, I… 

01:27:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you keep in the… in the box right now. 

01:27:40
ANN MARY Right I wish I wouldn't have taken it though because and it kind of… 

01:27:45
WILLIAM GLASSER To a little bit of a lock in there. 

01:27:45
ANN MARY Right. I wish I would have you know have the presence of mind to say, you know I don't think this is a good idea, but at the time I didn't. So and I… 

01:27:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Well the time you were in that frame of mind which is well, I mean, how can I hurt this poor guy or something or… 

01:28:00
ANN MARY Yeah, that's mean, he'll… he'll be questioned if I don't you know. 

01:28:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:28:10
ANN MARY So I'm… I'm I don't really wear it as much. You know usually if he is around I wear it, but you know on my own, I don't really don't. 

01:28:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Human being have variety of needs, that's one of the thing that I teach and one of the needs is freedom. Do you think that your need for freedom is kind of something that's important to you? 

01:28:30
ANN MARY Absolutely. 

01:28:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Hmm… hmm. 

01:28:30
JON CARLSON What did you come up with that, the idea about freedom. She is apologizing at first about taking this ring from this guy. 

01:28:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, all of us have, I teach basic need build into our genetic structure and the need for freedom is a very… very important need where a marriage is concerned. I say if two people with high freedom needs marriage, other than they're going to be like two ships that passing the night, I mean, they're not going to really hang around. Her freedom need was being reasonably satisfied with being him 650 miles south and seeing each other periodically weekends and things like that, but this was a needy guy and needy guys are attracted to non-needy women, because they figure these are strong woman and they can help. 

01:29:20
DIANE KJOS Like you and me. 

01:29:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah… yeah, but in some times strong women attract to needy guys, but she didn't seem to be looking for a guy to take here, If I did mention some words and there are not go for the show and these things that, you know, you're not… you're not looking the mother somebody are you. And oh no, she said there is nothing like that, but I just felt that this was something she should be aware of and… and if you're there is a need for the love which is good, if we want high need for love, it's good marriage and then there is a the need for power and when a high power person marries, he should not marry another high power person unless they are working together. 

01:30:05
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:30:05
WILLIAM GLASSER But if they are working not together they could really have a lot of trouble. 

01:30:05
JON CARLSON So as a referee there? 

01:30:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, I'd call if should Mary a lower power person. I have my best friend works out that way in… in his marriage and it works a really love. But high freedom people even if a high freedom person marries a little freedom person, freedom is something you got to kind of take a look at when you get married and… and she didn't, she had a freedom and then this women may never find a man to suit here and she's not you know we've being and terribly toeing up apart, because she's more toeing up about, getting into a situation she'd be unhappy and… 

01:30:45
JON CARLSON I guess having that six or eight hundred miles difference gives you a quiet a bit of freedom. 

01:30:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:30:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah… yeah. 

01:30:50
JON CARLSON In this next piece, we're going to watch you work as a counselor. You know you described that what your role was and almost talked to her about what it was that you were doing, I think, you did and you said my goal is to put myself in your shoes and then you dropped a couple of, just a little comments that had to do with, that she was a reasonable person that she was making reasonable request and then you talked about her talking with people who came from a beigest sector, let's watch this and hear your comment shortly. 

01:31:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

01:31:25
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:31:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Do you understand where I'm driving, and I mean, I've seen your life. 

01:31:30
ANN MARY Yes. 

01:31:30
WILLIAM GLASSER And I don't feel, I feel very hesitant, but I feel also kind of obligated to… to kind of put myself a little but in your shoes and help you to think this thing through that's what counselors do. 

01:31:45
ANN MARY Right. It's see that's what, I mean, its like nobody is, people just see that you know I'm passing up those opportunity nobody, I don't know. 

01:31:55
WILLIAM GLASSER You can only live our own life, nobody can live it for it, but let's being there and be kind and everything and it's your life and if the good times come they're going to enjoy it, if the bad times come, not going bother them at all. You know, your little grandmother would say, well, you made you're bed, live in it you know but you don't want to live in it, you know what I'm, it's tough. 

01:32:20
ANN MARY Exactly, so… 

01:32:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And if we could run through all the things that you expressed to me in this relatively short interview, we'd find that there is a lot of reasonable concerns, and… 

01:32:30
ANN MARY So you don't think I'm commitment phobic or… 

01:32:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I don't… I don't believe in that. I believe you're being cautious, I believe you have a need for freedom maybe a little more than the average person. 

01:32:40
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:32:40
WILLIAM GLASSER And you can't, you know some women all they want, you… you work with them all they want is a family and a husband and children and they just live for it. You're not one of those kind of women. 

01:32:55
ANN MARY No… no, I'm not. 

01:32:55
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, you can't, and those are the kind of people who are giving you the advice. 

01:33:05
ANN MARY Yeah. 

01:33:05
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, you're… you're getting advice from a buyer sector, I mean, I'm not saying they're bad people. 

01:33:10
ANN MARY No. 

01:33:10
WILLIAM GLASSER No, I mean… 

01:33:10
JON CARLSON Well, he comment on that section, William? 

01:33:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, being the whole purpose of my counseling is to make here a good what I think a positive helpful relationship and… 

01:33:25
JON CARLSON You summoned with their… 

01:33:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And I'm tying it up now, because then everything I say will really bring home, because you don't… you don't, none of us listen to people unless we have kind of I call their quality, where they put these people in our head is important people too. I saying, this can happen pretty quick in a counseling session, because they're coming for help and they're immediate helping person, it… it locks up pretty quick and my job is to deal with their responsibly and then not to do anything that I believe would take advantage over in any way, I'm not trying to push her to force her, but I certainly I'm saying, I'm a counselor, I'm not just sitting here as a buyer standard to our interaction. I have a purpose here and my purpose is to get you to take a look at your life, evaluate it and if there is problems in it, lets talk about them, because that's what counselors do and they do it quick. There is not reason to wait around. 

01:34:20
DIANE KJOS I was interested in and the way she was sitting at that point, do you… do you would, you just had her total attention, she was his totally involved. 

01:34:25
WILLIAM GLASSER She had mine too, well. I wasn’t board in this interview, that's one of the… that's one of the thing, if you're doing therapy and you get bored, there is something really wrong. 

01:34:35
DIANE KJOS Its not working? 

01:34:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:34:40
DIANE KJOS Yeah… yeah. 

01:34:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Like Dr. Harrington taught me again… again because I use to fall asleep sometimes and so did he and so I'd say well what happen when you fall asleep, he said, I tell him, if you're so dammed of, then you can't keep me awake, I want to go to sleep. 

01:34:50
JON CARLSON Great choice then more. 

01:34:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, let's go and assume that he said that, everything changes you know. 

01:34:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:35:00
JON CARLSON Yeah, well, it seems like the one thing that was happening here when you commented on in through, in the way she looked as she was being validated and it's been a long… long time since you know she'd validated. I mean, I'm reasonable, I have reasonable concerns. 

01:35:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Well she was bucking the… the moirés of 35 year old only daughters of the world who have the genes to carry on the family and I mean that she was bucking a lot of external pressure and that I call it a receptor outside. I hate to use the term people, so I tried to get it away form personalities, so I don't know where receptor came from, but I was happy when it came out of my mouth. 

01:35:40
DIANE KJOS She even have that "diagnosis commitment phobic" 

01:35:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well. I've heard like commitment phobic we have a lot to talk about that, you know how is about any way the thing is that, my own feeling about commitment phobic is thank goodness. They don't get married. At least this way they only torture one person themselves, but they don't I mean you should. If a person has to be dragged to the altar, that's not a… 

01:36:10
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:36:10
WILLIAM GLASSER …like someone asked the great director, Mike Nichols after the picture of the Dustin Hoffman and then Mrs. Robinson what is the picture of well anyway, you remember the one… 

01:36:20
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:36:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And they asked Mike Nichols… 

01:36:20
JON CARLSON The graduate. 

01:36:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Graduate. 

01:36:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:36:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And asked them, well, how long it last, and Mike Nichols said, I give it six weeks. You only dragged to the alter and all these guys and I mean that's because it's… its absolutely right. 

01:36:35
JON CARLSON Well, in the… in this piece you are becoming more directive and that yet in the next piece you're going to watch just… just a few minutes latter, you continue this active and directive roll, I mean, you're taking a stand on something, she said something about my kids come and go and then you kind of equipped like your boyfriend and… and then you came out and talked about, she said, I know you're not suppose to tell me what to do, and you said, oh, but I am, you know I am telling you what to do. 

01:37:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Sure. 

01:37:00
JON CARLSON Let's watch this. 

01:37:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Those kind of kids. 

01:37:05
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm and a lot of them are there very needy, you know. 

01:37:10
WILLIAM GLASSER At the end of the day sometimes you're glad to see him go, you know. 

01:37:15
ANN MARY Its yeah, some days it's just exhausting, because… 

01:37:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Glad to see him come and glad to see him go, almost like your boyfriend over the weekend. 

01:37:20
ANN MARY Yeah, exactly. So I don't know, I guess, I'm just looking for a somebody to tell me what to do when I know nobody is going to tell me that, but. 

01:37:30
WILLIAM GLASSER No, I am telling you few things with you, I'm telling you check it out, check out how you feel, be honest. Not being mean, I mean, check out the wedding ring is in the box, I mean the engagement ring is in the box. 

01:37:40
ANN MARY Hmm… hmm. 

01:37:40
WILLIAM GLASSER If he puts too much pressure on me happy to see him go. If he doesn’t call some week, it's okay with me, is that being selfish, I don't know. Is it your job to be the mother of the guy or I mean… 

01:38:00
ANN MARY Either, I don't know that's what it, and then I feel like, well may be I'm not really doing this guy any favors if I'm not planning on making that long term commitment, maybe I should let him go and be with somebody in his own backyard you know he could spend all those time with… 

01:38:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Something that I agree I'm talked about that, but now they bring it up, it's something you think about too. 

01:38:20
ANN MARY So I think you know… 

01:38:20
JON CARLSON Karl Rogers is spinning in his grave you know with this exchange. 

01:38:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah well, I spun in my grave when I saw him counselor and I haven't even dead yet and so the point is that, a counselor seems to me brings a certain expertise into counseling. 

01:38:40
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:38:40
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not just another person sitting there, one person is awarded my whole life. I mean, I'm 74 years old now, to trying to find out how people function. I've written a big book which very clearly give my ideas, I'm not saying there for everybody, but it's what I've found out called choice theory and I… and I not only practice and I live it. 

01:39:00
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:39:00
WILLIAM GLASSER In my life. I so, I'm not going to be wishy-washy, I feel counseling is teaching and I've got to teach her and basically when I'm teaching her… her some choice theory. I mean, I don't lay it out in those kind of terms, but I'm teaching her that she has choices in life and she should make her choices carefully after consideration and that I'm going to kind of say, you know you're dealing with a real person, I'm always going back to that story that Velveteen Rabbit, I don't want to be the Velveteen Rabbit, I want to be the live rabbit. 

01:39:30
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:39:30
WILLIAM GLASSER That she's talking to and so, I feel that, I don't feel I'm intruding on another person's life to give them our expertise and do it the way I do it. 

01:39:40
JON CARLSON You can't that be dangerous though, I mean… 

01:39:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Dangerous in what way? 

01:39:40
JON CARLSON What do you base these suggestions on. 

01:39:45
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm basing on a life long experience of working with people which and I don't keep it any secret. It's written out in several of my books, but the choice to it is why I put it all together in 1998 and then in my book Reality Therapy and Action the new book I showed how it works and I also believe that in counseling I didn't do it in this particular case, but and I don't really think I would have seen this girl again immediately, but if she came in another time, I would start to teach you some choice theory because you see choice theory, it helps you to figure how to live your life, to see a person a week and then they go about their business for a week and come back for a week, that isn't my goal, my goal is leading something they can be using all week long and when they come back they tell me how they've been using it and I want to teach him what it is and we reflect on that and we get pretty far down the road, pretty quick. I don't think therapy, in other way when you talk about brief therapy, long therapy to me is saying a person 15 or 20 times. Brief therapy is once or twice. 

01:40:50
JON CARLSON It's seems like you've collected the data and then maybe that's for sure it will that's not… not dangerous that it was really a hard data that you work from. 

01:40:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah, that… that's what I saw you doing, I think is giving back to her the… the very things that she'd already thought about or that she was… she was had been doing to some extent and affirming it for her. 

01:41:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Absolutely. 

01:41:10
DIANE KJOS And… and, I you know you think of that… that sort of expression that she had when you did that, it was like yeah, you know, and so, you weren’t… you weren't over care and she was over there I was very close kind of piece. 

01:41:20
JON CARLSON The many counselors are trained not to do this, I mean, they are trained that there is folks who just listen and… 

01:41:25
DIANE KJOS And not reflect that kind of piece, see I what… what, where the client is, although I think part of the concern is that you would have told her while you should go see a fortune teller or you should you do something she haven't thought of before her I have been doing, you know. 

01:41:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, I did a lot of things she hadn't taught of but… 

01:41:45
JON CARLSON Alright. 

01:41:45
WILLIAM GLASSER …but I did it on the basis of finding out for her. You know she presents herself as a human being, my expertise is dealing with in human beings are unhappy. 

01:41:55
DIANE KJOS Hmm… hmm. 

01:41:55
WILLIAM GLASSER No one has ever come to me and said my problem is, I'm just happy all the time. 

01:41:55
DIANE KJOS And so my life so good. 

01:42:00
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm not I'm really overwhelmed with those kinds of problems. So there, she was less overwhelmed with problems and I told her so the most of the people had come and but at again I say this is got to be a real relationship, she's got to know that she encountered that human being that was alive to her and her problem. I said, I'm trying to put myself on your shoes that got us closer, because I am trying to put myself on her shoes. 

01:42:20
DIANE KJOS Yes, yeah. 

01:42:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And in fact that she's a women I'm a man, that doesn’t make any difference about, but there is some problem of getting along with each other that's a universal human problem, we're all in each other shoes if we really look at any relationship we have so I don't… I don't feel that, I mean, I have… I have seen counselors who are afraid to say anything why? Why the be afraid of? We're running someone's life, I think, when a person comes in, I have a friend of mine who has a side and the sun goes to a psycho-analyst five times a week you know and then going on for a years and years and years and years. Well, I mean, it for he never claims so I can also use that therapy, it's like when others helping you understand your life and everything else, but… but still I wonder about this and he tells his father sometimes he doesn't say anything for a week. I mean, that's… that's another kind of therapy and I don't do that. 

01:43:20
JON CARLSON And then you had to treat the father. 

01:43:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, fortunately there is plenty of money so you don't have to worry about that, to say for the analyst too. But the, but… but… but the whole point is that we… we've got so… so afraid, so cautious about intruding into peoples life what are we sitting in the office for… for not going to intrude in their lives, are we just a mirror to reflect. I mean, people think that they can, you know, you can pull them into completely new therapy and I've heard some of these programs and they're… they're pretty straight forward programs and, but… but they are not therapy. Therapy is the human relationship to in two people with one person trying has hard as he possibly or she possibly can with what that person knows to literally to intrude into one another person's life. I didn't force you in the door, she came in. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS And you… and you earn the right 

01:44:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. 

01:44:15
DIANE KJOS To… to talk with. 

01:44:20
WILLIAM GLASSER I think so. 

01:44:20
JON CARLSON And then the final clip what we have is you are giving her homework or giving her some very specific suggestions to work on. Let's watch this piece. 

01:44:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

01:44:30
ANN MARY I just, I don't know, I… I you know I thought for the longest time it was me and I won't thinking maybe it's not, but it's… 

01:44:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Well this you, but there is nothing wrong with you being you? 

01:44:40
ANN MARY Yeah, you don't think? 

01:44:45
WILLIAM GLASSER No… no, you're not telling me anything that makes me in any way feel uncomfortable talking or hearing, I mean, to be very honest you mean you were you, I mean, I dont like I'm a counselor, I don't see many people who are kind of concern because they're almost to together. 

01:45:05
ANN MARY William, thank you. I just… 

01:45:05
JON CARLSON William, it sounded like you had to convince her there a little bit, but she was okay. 

01:45:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, it was worth of try, didn't hurt and she is okay, I mean, I'm giving her my honest opinion. The idea people she came in you could have said that some extent she was swishy, washy, should I or shouldn't I, will I or will not I or am or aren't I and all these kind of things, and that's fine… that's fine but… but she doesn't need a swishy, washy counselor. 

01:45:35
JON CARLSON Hmm… hmm. 

01:45:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, she needs, to feel that she is in the room with some one like say real, someone that she couldn't feel as concerned, there is an attachment because it's that counseling relationship which makes counseling work, it isn't… it isn't the great insight you give people or these kinds of things, it's… it's the relationship and it's hard to teach this to people. 

01:46:00
DIANE KJOS Hmm… hmm. 

01:46:05
WILLIAM GLASSER That… that… that… that's really the relationship between you and they, that's crucial that's why and in my latest book reality therapy in action, you can see in every… in every client I work with, we got a relationship going and I even point out where I screwed up, sometimes I… I said something that I can feel harm the relationship or I said, why did I say that, well, I made a mistake, but there are brain surgery, it will kill people for hard word comes out of your mouth. 

01:46:30
JON CARLSON That was nice too, the way you empowered her and said, are you have to do with your mom is to what you're doing with me, it's already within you. 

01:46:35
DIANE KJOS Hmm. Hmm. 

01:46:35
WILLIAM GLASSER That helps that relationship with her mother which she does wants… 

01:46:40
JON CARLSON She needs one, she is a got to get one outside of the therapeutic world. 

01:46:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, yeah, absolutely. I said, in the book reality therapy all of us need one essential relationship without that hard to function. 

01:46:55
JON CARLSON Thank you, very much. This has been very informative. We've learned reality and learned how to make choices. Thanks a lot William. 

01:47:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay.
