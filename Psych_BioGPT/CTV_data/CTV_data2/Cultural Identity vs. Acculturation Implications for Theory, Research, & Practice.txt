Cultural Identity vs Acculturation: Implications for theory, research and practice Manuel Ramirez III, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
DR. MIGUEL ARCINIEGA Thank you. I didn't know that you're clapping for the introduction. I, ah, Patricia had an introduction for, ah, 20 minute one(ph), but I guess I'm gonna have to cut it down. Thank you, all of you, for bearing with me. And, ah, I wanna tell you that it really gives me a great pleasure to introduce, ah, my friend, my colleague, my mentor, a, ah, scholar, a writer, ah, in many, many different ways. He's helped me throughout our career. I, first, I've gotta tell you a story. We, ah, I first met, uhm, Manuel when, ah, he and his, ah, colleague first put, put the first, uhm, Chicano Psychology conference, and I had just graduated, ah, have gotten my brand new doctorate and I attended this and never knew that I could finally felt, then I went to talk to him at that conference and I thought, "Isn't it nice to know that somebody is understanding what in the world you're coming into?" And ever since then, for over a period of time, ah, Manuel and I have crossed paths in like many different ways. We've used, Patricia and I have used his book in our counseling Latino class and, ah, and, and also in his, uhm, articles on Mestizo Psychology. Ah, before that, I used his cultural democracy and bicognitive development and it was a major text in most of the bilingual classrooms across the nation. So, his impact has been tremendous. And I, uhm, and not only a friend but I'm an admirer and I respect Manuel a great deal. Now, for the mo, those, that's an aside. I won't tell you some of the other stories 'coz he's got some other commandments that he's gonna come up with. Uhm, Manuel was born in, ah, Rio Grande City, Texas in, uhm, in, ah, in the historic community of Roma. And he, that he's, he always never fails to tell you all about Roma. I never even heard of it and I'm from Texas. He got his, he's got his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and, uhm, and from there he went to teach at various universities in, ah, in California, at Rice, Pitzer College in Claremont at UC Riverside which is where I got to know him and at the University of California at Santa Cruz. He's currently, right now, a professor of Clinical Psychology at University of Texas at Austin and, uhm, and Clinical Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. In addition to that, one of the things that has most impressed me about it is a num, in spite of all of the work that he's been doing, he has mentored a number of students and, of course, I get the benefit the benefit out of that or I send them to be in. So, without anymore, I wanna present my friend and colleague, Dr. Manuel Ramirez.

MANUEL RAMIREZ III  Thank you very much, ah, Miguel and, ah, thank you, ah, for making it possible for me to join you here at this conference, this important conference. It's, ah, always good to be able to get out of Texas especially the part of Texas where I'm from originally. Uhm, in South Texas you, uhm, you don't get the beauty that you get around here or the good weather most of the time. So, uhm, it's nice to be here, uhm. I, you, maybe you're wondering how Roma got the name Roma, right? There are no Roma tomatoes there, so, it's not that. Ah, apparently, the oblate fathers, ah, who came, ah, thereafter the town was founded, it was, ah, originally called the Nueva Revia(ph), saw seven hills and they named it after Rome, Italy. I think they've been nipping on the alter wine actually, ah. I've never been, I've never been be able to see the seven hills, but, ah, It's, it's better than that. Ah, the, the hills have coyote on them and it's the only place in the world where Smokey, the bear goes around singing, "Stranger in Paradise." But, anyway, seriously, ah, I wanna, ah, ah, thank Dr. Patricia Arredondo and Dr. Miguel Arciniega. I know they, they, they had a, a large part in getting me, ah, invited here. And, ah, I want to, uhm, talk about, ah, the, my own personal odyssey in, in the world of, of education and psychology in both the, ah, research angle, theory and applied work. And, uhm, as I review my life, I realized that, uhm, you know, it's, ah, there were many things where I happened to be at the right place at the right time. What is it, Woody Allen in one of his fi, film says, you know, "Success is 80 percent, you know, you know, being there is 80 percent of success, showing up is 80 percent of success." Well, I was, I was fortunate to be able to show up at the right time, I guess. But, ah, my, my origins in Roma I think were, were very important. I mean, this is the border area of South Texas. If you can envision this, Brownsville is at the very tip of Texas on the Gulf of Mexico and Loreto is further up the river, Roma is right on the river almost equidistant between Brownsville and Lareto. And, ah, the families that came there, ma, many of them have been there since about, ah, 1580, somewhere around there. So, it's, it's called sometimes La Patria Chica, the small country because it, it predated, ah, both, ah, the United States and Mexico and, of course, Texas. I always say Texas came to us. We did not mi, immigrate at Texas. So, ah, it's an important distinction there. And, and it felt very much so by to people, but it, there's a, a writer, I think he, he's a historian at University of Arizona, ah, Oscar Martinez who writes about this Ambiente Fronterizo, what, which exist on the border, ah, ah, the border environment which allows people to be more open to exchanging values and exchanging lifestyles. It's a diffusion of values that takes place across the border. And that was an important experience for me. I mean, we had family and both the Interior of the United States as well as the Interior of Mexico and the first big cities that I visited were Mexico City and Monterrey. So, ah, that was, uhm, important to be able to see how people just Anglos, Mexican-Americans and, ah, and Mexicans exchange values and lifestyles and to realize that acculturation and, and this is one of the main topic of my, my talk today, that acculturation is not only the way it's usually viewed by social scientist, American social scientist, ah, moving from the original group into the mainstream group. But the mainstream group can also move at the other way. And, ah, I'll give you a good story as an example. My, my father and I were visiting the, ah, gravesites of, of my grandparents, his parents in the cemetery, and as we're walking out, I noticed that one of the gravestones said Jones on it. And I said, "Jones," I said, "There are no, there are not that many Anglos in Roma. What, you know, how, why would this Jones that was, you know, back from, ah, 1700 or something." And he said, ah, "That's not, you see, it's, oh, that's at Hones(ph) family that lives down the street. So, they, Jones had become Hones(ph) and not only had, they became Mexicanized. So, I said, "Ah, you know, acculturation is not the way it's usually viewed. It's not inculturation. But it really is a multidimensional process and people can move in all directions in that. So, the origins on the border, we even had a, ah, a bilingual multicultural football team because they build, ah, an international dam, ah, about 15 miles from there, Falcon Dam. And a lot of the workers, the engineers that came down were Anglos, and all of a sudden, we had an, an infusion of Anglos into our high school. And, of course, Chicanos, I mean, most of us were big at 120 pounds, right? But we were flee to foot, right? So, we were on the ends and in the backfield but the Anglos man 200, 300 pounds. They were on the line, right? But, you know, we had, ah, this exciting place, you know, that, that enchilada rolled out to the left. Nobody can figure that one out. The taco bursts through the line. It always, it's a winner. So, anyway, ah, another big experience for me besides growing up in the border was going to California at the right time. I mean, you've got to be able to get out of Texas if you're gonna become a multicul, cultural and, going to California was great for me. And going to California at a time when the State of California was beginning to look into the educational needs of Mexican-American children for the first time. And being able to testify before the California State Legislature and then, having some of the same people that were in the California State Department of Education like, Armando Rodriguez moving to the U.S. Office of Education, and having him ask me to testify before the U.S. Congress on, ah, on, a, uhm, a, a bill that Peter Rodino had proposed, which eventually became the Bilingual Education Bill. So, all of that was, was terribly important because it focused my work on bicultural development and cultural identity and, ah, on bilingual education. And of course, being there when the Chicano Civil Rights Movement started, and especially when the, uhm, uhm, sorry, I went too far there. I didn't show, uhm, Dolores, but, ah, Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, I think, watching them do the, ah, Farm Worker, uhm, March on the State Capitol in California, I was at Cal. State, Sacramento at that time, and, uhm, and, you know, seeing them as models of people that could be multicultural, bicultural and multicultural, and I said, "Now, that's the prototype." I mean, that's what we have to work for. And, ah, that, that was a very important, ah, kind of time for me. And of course, Chicano studies program started up for the first time. And, ah, in 1968, I developed the first, ah, Chicano psychology course, it was called "The Psychology of the Chicano Child," and, ah, and that was when I was at Pitzer College of the Claremont Colleges. So, ah, all of that was, was very important in terms of my, uhm, development. But as we started to, uhm, to work on, uhm, bilingual multicultural education, we rapidly became aware, especially when the Civil Rights Commission hearings headed by Father Hesburgh, where hearing's held in San Antonio on Mexican-American issues, that teachers in the United States had been given a very clear directive, a mission. And that was, "inculturate Chicano children, Chicano and Chicana children. Take away their culture, take away their language." And it was set, first of all, by Cubberley who, by the way, has, ah, the Bill, Education Building at Stanford named after him. And he was a very influential figure in terms of educational teacher training policy back in the '30s. And as you see, everywhere, he's referring to members of minority groups. "They settle and, in, in settlements, we need to break them up, we need to implant in their children as far as can be done." He wasn't sure how much could be done at this. He didn't have much hope. "The Anglo-Saxon conception of righteousness, law and order, and our popular government and to awaken our reverence to our democratic institutions." So, ah, when Alfredo Castañeda and I began to write the book on cultural democracy, we began to really question a lot of things. Here's a, a sign that I saw. I attended summer school to try to get ahead when I was in high school at Edinburgh High School in then driven in the(ph) valley, much larger community and drama. And these were the signs that they had in their halls: "Be a good American. Speak English all the time." Well, my parents hardly ever spoke English and hardly knew this(ph), a very much English. So, how was it that they were not good American, so is it that many Mexican-Americans were not good Americans? When, Raul Morin(ph) had written the book, what was it? "A Call To Glory," where he said that Mexican-Americans have the most me, me, medals of honor, I think, than, proportionately, than any group in the United States. So, that, that was not correct. And, then one of the things that came out of the Civil Rights Commission hearings was these detention slips, slips that they would use for the "no Spanish" rule, that is the kids were punished, if they spoke Spanish in, in the classroom. They still do in some cases, yes. And this is a picture of the Civil Rights Commission hearing. Jack Forbes, I don't know if you remember, his "Aztecas Del Norte" but that was an important book. He was a professor at, ah, D-Q University in Davis, California. And I, I, e, a, along with George Sanchez and I, we were, uhm, all present the testimony before this, ah, Civil Rights Commission hearings. And, ah, they were able to show the conditions. For example, the, the Rio School District, which is, uhm, they're also on the, on the border. The poverty conditions of Mexican-American children and Mexican-Americans lived under and the segregation. See, there was an Anglo school and there was a Mexican school. And the Anglo school, of course, had all the advantages, ah, that, that you, you would want in a school district and the Mexican schools, of course, had, did not. So after the Civil Rights Commission hearings in sa, in San Antonio, it began to affect policy in the U.S. Office of Education. And the Civil Rights Office of the U.S. Office of Education, came out with a poster that had the pictures of Mexican-American children, and said, "I have a right to my culture and my language. This right is guaranteed by the Supreme Court of the United States." So, ah, that was a change in, in policy. So, from there, I started to work with Project Follow Through and tried to develop a curriculum that was a multicultural, bilingual curriculum. And one of the things that we were trying to do was to encourage children to become both Anglo and Mexican-American and Black children that were in the classrooms to develop more of a bicultural identity and an acceptance of cultural differences. So, this is one of the scales that we developed to look, to see that children were willing to speak Spanish, that they wore clothing, they were representative of Latino or Hispano culture, that they speak English spontaneously, that there was a willingness to accept kids from other ethnic groups. Uhm, we brought in the Chicano community. One of the things that Al Castañeda and I felt, was that we would go to classrooms that were supposed to be bilingual education classrooms and multicultural and I, I think we still see it in some classrooms. One corner, we, we used to call it the "piñata corner," you know, there it is. It, it's got a piñata, it's got a serape, and it's got a Mexican hat, and that's it. That's the Mexican culture. And we said, "Ah-ah. Let's start bringing in the parents, and the grandparents from the community. Let's involve them in the classroom." And it served one to get them interested in the whole educational system, and they helped us write some of the curriculum for our Nuevas Fronteras project. But the other thing it did, is encourage them to go, first, to the community college to get their Child Development Associates degree, then on to Cal. State San Bernardino. This was in Cucamonga, California, Southern California, and to get their teaching credential and eventually, they would start running for the board, you know, which, ah, so that the school board, eventually became a majority of Mexican-American school board, ma, majority of Mexican-American community. What we did was write curriculum, curriculum units that, ah, were part of the history of Mexican and, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans like the Quetzalcoatl, El Maiz, the Corn, the, the, these were units that included science and oral language development and reading and math, ah, folklore, Dias de Fiesta, nature. So that we, we inco, incorporated culture in, in that way and in terms of cognitive style that culture was more than just the content, just the language and just the values, but it was also the thinking style. It was the learning style that Mexican-American children were using and the teaching style that teachers were using to teach them. So every curriculum unit had a cognitive flexibility component, where they would do in a co, cooperation or individual competition, where they would focus on the global or focus on the parts specific. And this was what some of our classrooms that we got away from the piñata corner. 

00:18:30
 Okay. 

00:18:30
MANUEL RAMIREZ III  And we started to do research with, ah, adults, college students as we did research with Mexican-American children on how they develop multicultural orientations to life. And with their families, we started to do research with university students in Texas and California. And we decided to develop a multicultural experience inventory that would have both historical development patterns. That is, people had grown up in communities where they had interacted with children of different racial and ethnic groups, or primarily with just their ethnic group, as well as their contemporary that is, " I enjoy going to gatherings at which people are." In other words, what are they doing now, what was the historical part of it and what are they doing now to make it a more complete measure of cultural identity. And we studied the, uhm, behaviors of multicultural leaders. We developed groups that were mixed, racially and ethnically, and we presented a difficult topic, where the leader either scored, was scored low on multicultural identity or high, and we would study their leadership behaviors to see if they were more capable of bringing their groups to consensus. And, of course, that's an observer who is, ah, observing the group and writing down what they say. And here's what we've found, that if they were monoculturals, they were very low on the multicultural experience inventory, they didn't clarify the issues under discussion as much as if they, when they were multicultural leaders. They didn't address members by the first name. They're very, ah, very mundane kind of thing. Do you learn the first name? I mean, these are strangers when they meet in this group. Do they learn the first names of their members of the groups? Are they active and assertive in trying to get the discussion of the group going and trying to get the group to reach consensus? So, that gave us an idea that we needed to change the models of acculturation that were present. And the old model of acu, acculturation we called conflict replacement. That is, you start with a native culture, you've got the Anglo middle-class culture over here. If you're closer to your native culture, you're considered to be more maladjusted. As you get closer to the Anglo culture, you're supposed to get better adjusted, you know, because supposedly, you know, you become more Anglo, right? And we move to this one. We called it as, u, synthesis, unity, and expansion model. You have the native culture. You have other minority cultures. You have Anglo middle-class culture. In some cases, I think we can say the majority culture because rapidly, I think, in some states, what used to be the minority cultures are really becoming the majority cultures. So, and, and that leaves to a synthesis and amal, amalgamation, which gives people more adaptability and more flexibility in a variety of different cultural situations and, and, uhm, uhm, sit, ah, situations in general. And an ethanol psychology began to develop. In 1973, as Miguel indicated, we had the first Chicano Psychology conference. Out of that came this book by Joe Martinez, and president as, at conference, was Martha Bernal whom you, ah, heard, ah, talked about this morning, ah, Martha, ah, credited that conference were, with turning her interest around and doing just general research with conduct disorders in children to doing identity development with Mexican-American children. And, ah, Art Ruiz was there, Amado Padilla was there, uhm, ah, Edgar(ph) Cervantes. Miguel was there. So, ah, that, that was an important, and, and then in, in African- American Psychology. This, my, my, my good friend, Robert Guthrie. "Even the rat Was White," that American Psychology was geared to attempting to show that people of color were inferior to White. And they did it with intelligence testing, and they, they did it with, in a variety of different ways by, uhm, talking about differences in skin color, and, ah, the closer you got to white to the, the more intelligent were you supposed to be, and the healthier you were supposed to be. So, ah, the, I've, I strongly recommend that book. 

00:23:05
MANUEL RAMIREZ III So, as we began to, as ethnopsychology really developed and we began to understand what people go through in developing cultural identity, (clears throat) we began to think in terms of, but that, it, it did have positive and negative things. I mean, you do have a lot of stress that relates to developing cultural identity in, in a situation in which your culture is demeaned, your race is demeaned, your language is demeaned, your history is demeaned. So, one of my former students, Norma Rodriguez, ah, who is at the Claremont Colleges now, and Hector Myers, who's a professor at UCLA, developed this multidimensional, acu, acculturative stress inventory, in which they separate minority stress from acculturative stress. You know, that acculturative stress, you get from just becoming more familiar with mainstream American culture, and with English and things like that. But minority stress, you get when you feel that you're put down because you are different. And that we really have to measure both. This is a picture of my home community, Roma, and now coming full circle. The present research that I'm doing is intergenerational family research, where I'm studying grandparents, parents and adolescents who were high school students, in the same family to see how cultural change is related to health, to mental health, and to, ah, attitudes towards drug use, drug abuse, that kind of thing. And I chose Roma, partly, because I wanna understand myself. It has been a long, ah, I still don't understand myself completely. So, I figured if I study my people in my community, I might stand a chance. So, I want to show you a picture of what Roma looks like. This is from the Mexican side of the border, looking in towards Roma. Its got a lot, ah, historic, ah, buildings that are now being returned to their original state by a grant from The Meadows Foundation. That's the old tower of that church, like 300 years old. And Viva Zapata was filmed in this, ah, Anthony Quinn got a supporting actor award. It was, ah, Marlon Brando, Jean Peters, and, ah, I was actually the stand-in for Marlon Brando. But, you know, my shoulders weren't wide enough. Ah, and they have a nice little Mariachi dance group, you know, and they, they won, ah, last year, they won the Mariachi competition, and they went to Santa Fe, you know, for that. And now, the hypotheses that we had in our study, it's a two-year study that we've now completed, 60 families. And the main hypothesis was, was that cultural identity would be curvilinearly related. Now here's, this may seem a little complicated, but what happens is that if you look at the culture change literature, it's confusing that some studies show that as you become more bicultural, you seem to have more problems of adjustment, more conflicts. Other studies show that as you become more bicultural, you really become more flexible, adaptable, and you're able to get along better, and you're better adjusted, and you have more family harmony. Now, but what's happened is the types of acculturation instruments that were used to measure culture change. Now, if you just use instruments, like the acculturation rating scale for Mexican-Americans as one of them, it contains primarily attitudes and preferences. You know, I prefer to speak Spanish. I prefer to speak English. I eat Mexican food. I don't eat Mexican food. But we felt that the important components missing were the behavioral components. What are people actually doing? What is their history? What kind of historical development pattern have they followed? Who were their childhood friends? Who were their adolescent friends? And what are they doing now, and the values? Values were not really a part of those acculturation-rating instruments. So, we felt that it probably was a curvilinear relationship. That if you could really identify the people who were truly bicultural iden, identity types, they would show better health and better family harmony. And if you didn't have that, that you would have more problems. And that's, uhm, ah, I'm gonna just run you through the hypothesis, but these are the objectives that we want to clarify, the relationship between cultural identity and unity-disunity, and, ah, set, and different instrument for assessing acculturation and so forth. Now, ah, that, that's a poor choice, pseudo bicultural. I, I think I'd, I prefer to call them minimal biculturals. But, what's happening is that you've got five identity types, cultural identity types that we could identify with the new instrument of acculturation that we developed. You could be balanced bicultural just like you're a balanced bilingual, right? And you're Anglo-preferred bicultural, or you're a Latino-preferred bicultural, right? And these were the ones that were being misidentified as biculturals here in the downside of the curve. They're really more monocultural people with just minimal orientation towards biculture, but that was confounding the data. So, what we were doing was separating them, and we used several instruments. We used some of the instruments of the, ah, some of the items of the ARSMA, we've used the family attitude, traditional and some modernism, the mal, multicultural experience inventory, and then we assessed mental health through the brief symptoms inventory, and my present life and family strengths inventory. And basically, this just tells you, at year one, we did 30 families, 15 working class, 15 middle class, and we did an ethnography. At year two, we did another 30 families. Again, 15 middle class, 15 working class, and we did an intensive family study with five families. And basically, this is the bicultural index that we've developed where we took part of the ARSMA. We introduced the values through the family attitude scale. And the multicultural experience inventory gave us a, gave us a behavior, both historical and contemporary. And this is a bicultural index, and we developed the degrees of variance that are accounted for, and, you know, if you're interested in it, I'll send you a copy, ah, hard copy of all of these, ah, visuals. And this is the way we arrived at the curvilinear findings. First, by looking at the demographic variables and testing on that control variables, and the bicultural index factors, we had seven factors of those, and then by doing quadratic forms of each of the bicultural index fa, factors entered in a stepwise fashion to determine whether the curvilinear model would be better than a linear model. And basically, the findings, linear findings, we found that adolescents, 30 percent of the variance was accounted for in predicting anger in adolescents, ah, psychotisism, basically, it, it includes symptoms like some auditory and visual hallucinations, that kind of thing, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and then grandparents , ah, and, ah, our family total lead means that more family harmony, ah, was predicted, ah, for, uhm, some of the subjects there. Ah, drug attitudes, 38 percent of the variance of that. Now the curvilinear findings, and you can see how much of the data would have been ignored, had we not done the curvilinear re, uhm, ah, type of analysis. But minority- status stress in adolescents are for the minority stress comes in, and the acculturation hostility, and parents' psychoticism and parents' depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and the more bicultural you are, the fewer of these symptoms you have. And, our family total for adolescents, drug attitudes in, in parents, that is, the more bicultural they are, the more, the less likely they are to say they're gonna use drugs and le, less likely they condone drugs. And those were all significant. And, the parents, of course, present life, acculturative stress, minority stress, and acculturative stress in grandparents. So, where are we now? As, as I get, ah, ah, as I become more, ah, despondent and, ah, ah, as I, I look, and, and I think I'm, I, I know I'm closer to the end of my career than(ph) the beginning. I say, how much have we accomplished? How, how far have we gotten? I mean, we had, had that, as far as I know, the first National Bilingual Conference at the University of California Riverside in '72. And then we had the first Chicano Psychology Conference in '73. Have we made any progress, that, yes, there are all the, these signs that, you, you know, Antonia Darder wrote this book: " Culture and Power in the Classroom." And she finds that, and, and there are classrooms in which culture has really been broadened to the curriculum in a meaningful way, that learnings styles and teaching styles are really being looked at. Ah, but, you know, when you really see other situations, that it would've gone back to the piñata corner in many ways that we could certainly go out here in schools, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, all over the place, and we'll find there's the piñata corner, and that's, that's it, that's Mexican culture that they're doing. And there's really new meaningful inclusion of the culture. So, there's some positives, there's some negatives. Uhm, ah, its it, it's interesting that, you know, I, I read an article in the Austin paper that was actually reprinted from the Houston Post, that a, a rather conservative community in Texas, uhm, the one close to A and M, uhm, ah, college station in Bryan, Bryan. The Anglo parents are demanding that the school district have bilingual education. Ah, finally! You know, now if the Anglo parents demanded, we're gonna get it. See? And with, ah, globalized industry, being what it is, and globalized business and multinational corporations, and everything, there is that need, and people are beginning to recognize. I mean, the children need to know more than one language if they're gonna survive in the world of the future. Uhm, George Sanchez, ah, was, uhm, you know, well, I bet(ph) evaluate psychology as well. How far have we gone in psychology? Educational psychology has done great. Arizona State is a good example of that. I mean, you have a very diverse faculty here in educational psychology. And, Patri, Dr. Patricia Arredondo is now the president of Division 45. We have a Division 45, the Ethnic Minority Affairs Division. We have a journal, hey, all of those are very positive things. We've been able to bring in and mentor more students. But on the negative side, as Martha Bernal pointed out in the study that she did for the American Psychological Association, we're not making much of an inroad in these inroads in psychology departments. We're losing professors from psychology departments that are minority members instead of gaining them. So, that's a negative. Representation in journals. One, one of my graduate students is doing a study at five, looking at five APA journals to see how, what the representation is of, ah, Latino, ah, data. It's very underrepresented, you know, compared to the population in the way that population is going. So, again, there are positives and there are negatives. Well, George Sanchez was, ah, a very important, ah, model for me. And, uhm, there was something that he said in his, uhm, in his keynote address at that bilingual conference that we had at, at, ah, UC Riverside, and I, I wanna leave you with this thought of, a, a, a quote that I took from his talk. He says, he was referring to the status of education for Mexican-Americans at that time, and I don't think it's much a different now. He said, uhm, ah, and certainly they hold true for psychology and for higher education our drop-out rate for, ah, African-American and Latino students is still very high in colleges and universities. Yes, they come in, but few graduates. He said, he was referring to educational change, "The educational change?" Question mark. "I see only feeble attempts here and there. The assembly line, standard mold, Anglo middle class tradition, still treats Mexican American children as if they were lumps of inferior cra, clay, then nonetheless has to be pressed into the mold. I recall the silent movie," ah, "Modern Times, with Charlie Chaplin, he worked all day on an assembly line." He says, " tightening a bolt on a gadget," and that's all he did. Just tighten this one bolt on this one gadget. He said, "Afterward, trudging down a dusty road in his imit, inimitable costume and shuffle, he continue to tighten those nonexistent bolts". And, he said, with few exceptions, he said, "The education of Mexican-American children," and I would add to that the mental health practices that we use. You know, the factor we ignore racism, racial profiling, cultural profiling, all of those things, that we still epitomize what Charlie Chaplin was caricaturing. And I hope this conference can turn that around. The hope we can commit ourselves to making sure that real change takes place in education and psychology, and that the next time we get together, things will be different. Thank you very much.

[sil.] 

00:37:35
 (inaudible ) And because of our, our technical problem, but, ah, ah, we do have time for questions and so, two, three, or so, and let's just see how it goes. 

00:38:00
MANUEL RAMIREZ III Thanks. Any questions, or are you all ready to get some fresh air? (laughs) You've been sitting there far too long. I'm sorry. Any questions? Did I, I've, did, did I go too fast over some, some things? Ah, any things I can clarify? Ah, yes Sir. 

00:38:20
 I had, just a question here. How do you see the balance between a sort of diversity type comprehensive trends these days that are so popular and there are probably some university will(ph) say versus some of these (inaudible ) that is more, in a particular group developing, ah, communities within a certain, ah, groups, and ah, some people saying those two things that's kinda incompatible and looks like, to me, in some ways (inaudible ) more appropriate that makes all focused out there. That's diversity rather than to develop, ah, within, ah, community kinds of things. 

00:38:55
MANUEL RAMIREZ III Well, and, you know, I see, I see it is, it, it, it'd be important, I think, to go both ways. To be able to have the sense of community that I think many minority students need in order to be able to survive in predominantly White campuses. Because, ah, it, it takes, I remember, going from Roma, Texas, to the University of Texas and seeing people, their fraternities and sororities, and, ah, seeing just a completely different culture, and a completely different environment, it was so important for me to have people from Laredo and El Paso, and, and, from my own hometown that we could get together and we had a cultural crash pad. I think, I think we need a cultural crash pad. But we also need that interchange, ah, under conditions where people are willing to learn from each other. And I teach a seminar now on, I've expanded the, ah, psychology of the Chicano child to the psychology of what I call Ethnic Minority Children and Adolescents. And I, what I tell the students is that a, uhm, when I'm defining it now in terms of diversity is differentness, that whether you have a physical, ah, handicap, disability of some kind, whether you're gay, lesbian, whether, ah, you happen to be a member of a racial or ethnic group, ah, or different in some other way that that's the important thing that you're gonna be disfranchised, you're gonna feel different, you're gonna feel left out, you're gonna have minority status stress, and you're gonna have acculturative stress. So, i, i, in, in the exchange, I think, that takes place and the learning experience that takes place because they're able to talk about some of their personal experiences in the seminar that it, ah, it really, you, you get both, you get the, the sense of the cultural crash pad and people being able to commit, communicate together and get together, we've had similar experiences and you get the learning from each other in an atmosphere of openness(ph), then, be in the front that he saw that, that the very much a part of the border, and I wish we could somehow transfer it to colleges and universities, that would be very nice, hard to do. Miguel? 

00:41:15
MIGUEL CASTANEDA One, one of, one of the things that you mentioned was that this model of acculturation which is, which is, as you pointed out, the best model that is the synthesis, can you tell me how those variables that you pointed out because if you could get people to move in that direction, that means in terms of self-concept, in terms of accomplishment, feeling good about going into the university, what kind of activities would you have a person go through to get to this model? 

00:41:45
MANUEL RAMIREZ III  Well, I think the important thing is, one, can the person feel valued first of all? I mean, y, you come into a new environment, can you feel valued, can you feel accepted, all right? And once that happens, then, I think that you can begin to show what I call it, uhm, you know, acting like a cultural educator, a multicultural educator where you let other people know about your culture and your language and then eventually functioning like what I call a multicultural ambassador where, i, i, which is what, a lot of these multicultural leaders were doing and those multicultural groups that we had where they really get people to work together on certain issues and to try to understand their differences 'coz now, you, you function like a catalyst and, and you get people to really bring out their differences and discuss their differences and, and accept their differences and, and that's where you begin to get the synthesis and the amalgamation. But you need to feel confident first. You need to have that self-esteem. You need to feel that you, you are valued and, ah, as a member of, ah, of, of a psychology faculty and many times when I feel like Rife Ralph Ellison, the invisible man, you know. Because, you know, when you're alone and you don't have, ah, what is called a, ah, critical mass, you know, you had, you don't have at least one other colleague that can share what you do and can, i, in department meetings, you get tired of bringing up these same issues and it says, "Oh, there's Ramirez again, you know, I'm, I know what he's gonna say," you know, and they, they cut themselves, they cut you off basically. They turn their hearing aids off and, ah, it, it, it's so frustrating that eventually you just wanna quit doing it because you're having to start to square one over and over again. So somehow, we've gotta get to that point, you know, where people don't see it as a power struggle and they're willing to accept the point of view of somebody else without threatening theirs. And boy, psychologists are some of the worst people in the world. I mean, I, there are very few, there're very few psychologists that you like, ah, that I really like. I mean, do you know, do you know many psychologist who you really like? I, it, it, what is in with psychology gentlemen(ph). Not educational psychology. Educational psychology are nice people. Social workers are nice people but psychiatrist and clinical psychologists, my goodness, just, will you mind, well edit that from that tape. (laughing). Well, it, it, it's just so frustrating to, to, ah, put up with. I mean, ah, it's just, I mean, ah, anybody here from the psychology department? No, you, you're, you're too nice to be from the psychology department. (laughs) 

00:44:45
 I think maybe that that's, ah, that's a great note. 

00:44:50
MANUEL RAMIREZ III All right. Do, do, do I get a pen, by the way, sir? 

00:44:55
 Ah, before we applaud, I would like to, to thank, uhm, ah, Dr. Ramirez very much further for speaking and I, I think it's clearly has made a tremendous differences in spite of his own, ah, self-doubts, ah, and, ah, we're very happy to have you here. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
MANUEL RAMIREZ III Well, thank you (inaudible ) 

00:45:16

00:45:16

00:45:20
MANUEL RAMIREZ III Ah, yeah. I get a pen. Yes, If I can get a pen for bad things, I know, I really made it. Thank you guys, thank you, Jeff(ph). 

00:45:25
