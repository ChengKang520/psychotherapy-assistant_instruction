ALLISON CAMERON It's challenging different parts of your brain, different parts of your body. I'd like to see you guys challenging their self in a different way. 

00:00:45
NARRATOR Exercise can do a lot for the body but what can it do for the brain? Some intriguing research suggests getting fit will help you get smart. Don't believe it? These Saskatoon students didn't either until their teacher set up an innovative fitness program. Joan Leishman took you inside the classroom earlier this year, and she recently caught up with the teacher for an update.

JOAN LEISHMAN At 14, Barney Stepanow [SP] has already been to the school of hard knocks. He's bounced between the city and the reserve and pulled by the addictions on the street. Barney goes to school now at City Park Collegiate in Saskatoon, a high school of last resort for kids who haven't been able to make it anywhere else. Kids whose lives are full of pain. 

00:01:50
BARNEY STEPANOW I started drugs when I was eight years old. I started drinking when I was about 10. Uh, it was quite bad for me, like, I knew, I knew I was doing bad stuff. 

00:02:00
JOAN LEISHMAN Huge efforts are made here to keep kids in school and find ways to help them succeed. There is free food and clothing. There's a daycare where young parents can leave their children, and there's a feeling of family. A place that's safe from the dangers outside. In the past, school has taught these kids little more than frustration and failure. When Barney first arrived at City Park last year, he couldn't read or write. 

00:02:35
BARNEY STEPANOW Well, it was embarrassing for me 'coz, uh, it was hard for me to go out in public and, like, knowing all these things that, just looking at signs, what they say, and what do they say? 

00:02:50
[sil.] 

00:02:50
JOAN LEISHMAN Like Barney, the other grade eights were also struggling at school. They were working at about a grade four level, and that wasn't all teacher Allison Cameron had to deal with. 

00:03:00
ALLISON CAMERON Behavior's typically a problem, uh, a lot of ADHD. More than half my class last year was ADHD diagnosed, on Ritalin. Um, we see a lot of kids with oppositional defiance disorder, all sorts of diagnosed illnesses that prevent them from learning or from behaving appropriately. 

00:03:20
JOAN LEISHMAN Fourteen-year-old Desten Mesner [SP] was one of her pupils who excelled at behaving badly. He's a budding artist, but he was better known around school for his anger and defiance. Desten was a real challenge even for someone trained to deal with behavioral problems like Allison Cameron. 

00:03:40
ALLISON CAMERON It didn't matter what I asked Desten to do, he said, "No." He would swear at me all of the time, tell me where to go, how to get here. 

00:03:50
DESTEN MESNER That's kind of one of the reasons why I was put into an alternative school, is because I swore in class and, uh, I used to not really like anyone, at all. 

00:04:10
JOAN LEISHMAN But Cameron could see enormous potential in her students. The question was, how to get at it? She thought there could be an answer in a book entitled, "Spark" by Harvard University psychiatrist, John Ratey. "Spark" examines how exercise affects the brain. 

00:04:30
JOHN RATEY It promotes, uh, uh, a process what we call, Neurogenesis or growing new brain cells. There's nothing that we know of that does that better than exercise. 

00:04:45
JOAN LEISHMAN "It doesn't only help brain cells grow," says Dr. Ratey, it also affects behavior. 

00:04:50
JOHN RATEY People who are sharper, they're more attentive, they're less impulsive, they're less fidgety, uh, they can sustain their attention longer and, uh, it promotes their ability to sort through information and take it in. 

00:05:10
JOAN LEISHMAN Ratey's best example is Naperville Central High near Chicago, which, today, has one of the best academic records of any secondary school in the U.S. and one of the lowest obesity rates in the country. 18 years ago, the school developed a fitness program where every student did vigorous aerobic exercise everyday for 45 minutes. It was the first program of its kind in the U.S. One that also has an innovative combination of movement and classroom learning. And when the school entered an international competition in math and science where Americans usually place 11th or 12th, Naperville came out on top. 

00:05:55
JOHN RATEY Ninety-eight percent of their, uh, eight-graders took this test and they scored number one in the world in science and number six in math, which was amazing. It shows one that spending that 45 minutes a day on PE was not taking away from their academic prowess. 

00:06:20
JOAN LEISHMAN Excited by Naperville, Allison Cameron went to her principal and asked if she could move exercise equipment into her classroom. Kerry Alcorn was easily convinced. 

00:06:30
KERRY ALCORN When Ally came to me with the proposal that, uh, someone was gonna donate a fair bit of phys ed equipment for us, uh, that was, that was pretty easy to say yes to. The, the one initial concern I had was where are you gonna put all that equipment? 

00:06:45
JOAN LEISHMAN While that was quickly resolved, what was tougher was convincing the kids to use it. It was defiance all around. Most of them initially thought that this was really hokey. Why would I get on a treadmill? 

00:07:05
DESTEN MESNER Oh, well, I said, "Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, doesn't do anything. No, no, it's bull. Pure bull." 

00:07:15
[music] 

00:07:15
JOAN LEISHMAN That was then, this is now. Monday morning math class where the first thing grade nine students do is strap on a heart monitor. 

00:07:25
ALLISON CAMERON Good morning, you guys. Please make sure your heart rates are at 134. Keep it there. 

00:07:35
[music] 

00:07:35
JOAN LEISHMAN For 20 minutes the kids workout on exercise equipment right in the classroom. 

00:07:40
ALLISON CAMERON But once a week I'd like to see you guys challenging yourself in a different way. Challenging different parts of your brain, different parts of your body. 

00:07:50
[music] 

00:07:50
JOAN LEISHMAN After what is for some a grueling start to the day, it's time for the second half of math class. And this is when you notice that something very different is going on. They're concentrating and working hard. Nobody's swearing or running around. When before some students could barely sit still for 10 or 15 minutes. 

00:08:20
ALLISON CAMERON I had improved attention for three hours. Um, students were getting off of Ritalin. Students were coming to school everyday just so they could use the treadmills. Well if you have kids coming to school everyday, well now you can teach so much more. If they can sit and stay focused you can teach so much more effectively. 

00:08:45
JOAN LEISHMAN None of this surprises Harvard's John Ratey. 

00:08:50
JOHN RATEY When you raise the heart rate what you do is you turn on a part of the brain that might be a little bit sleepy, that is the front part of the brain. That is involved in controlling impulses, and this is the major effect that one sees with kids that have trouble managing their behavior in class, speaking out too much, not, uh, acting out, being too fidgety, not being able to sit still. 

00:09:20
JOAN LEISHMAN There's a growing body of science now about the different ways exercise affects the brain. This part, the hippocampus, is like Central Station for learning and memory. Sustained, vigorous exercise causes the release of nerve growth factors especially one called BDNF which acts like a fertilizer on this and other areas of the brain. 

00:09:45
JOHN RATEY We make so many good things like this miracle grow for the brain, for instance, uh, when our brain cells are clicking away. So it bathes the brain, if you will, in this, uh, nice fertilizer which helps preserve the nerve cells, um, make them stronger, helps them withstand stress, and makes them more pliable. 

00:10:10
JOAN LEISHMANN It isn't just any kind of exercise that sharpens your brain function. The key is sustained aerobic movement. Scientists are still trying to discover the exact formula for different ages but here's what they think is best for high school students. Get the heart rate up to between 65 and 75% of its maximum and keep it there for at least 20 minutes. That's what makes this program so different from a regular gym class. In phys ed classes there usually a few kids who get their hearts pumping hard, but most don't. there's a lot of hanging around, some try to avoid participating altogether. 

00:10:55
JOHN RATEY Most of gym classes, is standing around for many people waiting for their, for their turn at bat, and I think today we're, we're looking at everyone not just the 20% who, who probably don't gym class because they're athletes and they're on teams, etc. But it's the other large group of students who hate gym class because they can't, they don't have the skills. Uh, the programs that are most successful are where they're constantly in motion. 

00:11:30
[sil.] 

00:11:30
JOAN LEISHMAN Allison Cameron considers her experiment wildly successful and she can prove it. Her grade eights were tested before they began using the treadmills and again at the end of the year. On average, they gained a full grade level in reading, in writing, and in math. 

00:11:50
ALLISON CAMERON There's no way to explain it other than this program. I had them from September till February and I didn't see any sort of improvements even close to that. 

00:12:05
JOAN LEISHMAN Wow. 

00:12:05
ALLISON CAMERON So in the last four months, the only thing that changed was the treadmills. 

00:12:10
JOAN LEISHMAN So how did Barney Stepanow do? Remember, at the beginning of grade eight he couldn't read or write. And at first, things weren't looking good. 

00:12:20
ALLISON CAMERON I could not get him to sit in his desk 10 minutes max, unless he was sleeping, which, it was, it was one extreme or the other. By February, he, he was the kid that had, for the first time, finished an assignment. 

00:12:35
BARNEY STEPANOW Well, I just noticed, you know, I started getting smarter. I started, I started knowing, I started paying attention more. 

00:12:45
JOAN LEISHMAN Barney also started talking about turning his life around and thinking about his future. 

00:12:50
BARNEY STEPANOW You know, I just see people out there doing drugs, doing needles, and I see that ba-, basically everyday, and I, sa-, I look at that person and is like, is that me? Is that how I wanna grow? Is that, is that gonna be in the future? 

00:13:05
20% 400% 

00:13:05
JOAN LEISHMAN During the four-month long program, Barney's academic performance took a huge leap forward. His reading improved over 20% and his comprehension by 400%. 

00:13:20
ALLISON CAMERON You always know something, Desten. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:25
DESTEN MESNER I don't. 

00:13:25
JOAN LEISHMAN Allison Cameron says Desten has benefited, too. These days they have a good rapport. He's taking a real interest in his classes and he's less defiant. 

00:13:35
ALLISON CAMERON Desten and I have a really good relationship now, and I don't know that we necessarily would have without that. Um, he, he really puts a lot in this. For him, it was really out of his comfort zone. 

00:13:50
DESTEN MESNER Yeah, it kinda changed. 

00:13:55
JOAN LEISHMAN What changed your mind? 

00:13:55
DESTEN MESNER Well, I felt more energized, for one. I felt a little bit happy-ish. 

00:14:05
25% 25% 30% 

00:14:05
JOAN LEISHMAN The biggest turnaround was in Destin's mood. He was able to control his anger and to concentrate more. But academically, he also showed remarkable progress. His reading went up by 25%, math 25% and comprehension by 30%. At school and at home, kids are moving less and less. Unlike our ancestors who were on the move all the time, we mostly sit our butts, hunter, gatherers of information. 

00:14:35
JOHN RATEY Our brains are geared for us to, to move and if we don't, we get into this kind of trouble that we're in to-, today, lack of resilience, uh, the obesity crisis to be sure, and actually not using our, our brains to the maximum. 

00:14:55
JOAN LEISHMAN Allison Cameron and her students won't have to worry about that. Her program worked so well last year that this year it's been expanded. Now most of City Park's grade eights and nines workout in class 20 minutes three times a week. Her greatest satisfaction, though, is that something so simple has affected her students in such a profound way. 

00:15:20
ALLISON CAMERON Oh, God, we never, never dreamed that we would have had the amount of success that we had last year. It was incredible. Everybody improved and if I wasn't there, if I didn't witness it, I honestly wouldn't believe it. Check your heart rate right now, please, Barney. 

00:15:40
JOAN LEISHMAN Cameron feels she's found a winning formula, less sitting equals more learning, and it's a formula she's hoping to share. She's help set up a foundation to encourage other schools to get involved in similar programs, and if they can't afford it, provide them with the necessary equipment.

NARRATOR Recently, I caught up with Allison Cameron again here in Toronto. She was in town to receive an aware for her contribution to education. It gave me a chance to find out how the rest of the school year went. So school's been over for some time now. Um, how did, uh, Barney and Desten do? 

00:16:25
Allison Cameron Teacher 

00:16:25
ALLISON CAMERON Um, academically they both did sa-, well. Unfortunately, Barney didn't do as well as the rest of his classmates, but he had left and moved up to his reserve for several months and had just returned, um, right before the documentary aired. And then, he kinda thought that he was a movie star after. And, you know, his behavior declined for a little while. He was thinking he should have been signing autographs instead of doing homework. So, um, he was back on track by the end of the year, and, um, doing quite well. Desten, uh, had a little bump in the road, as well, too, kind of, I'm not really sure. It was a really big deal for you guys to be out there. That kind of stuff doesn't happen everyday, especially to these kids. And, um, so afterwards, you know, we met a little bit of resistance with behavior but academically, I'm very proud of how the grade nines who participated in the program did. 

00:17:20
JOAN LEISHMAN And how did they, uh, how did the class overall do? 

00:17:20
ALLISON CAMERON Um, the grade nines who participated in the documentary program improved at least a full grade level in their English language arts. So in their reading, their writing and in their cite word-, vocabulary. And now some people have said, "Well, a full grade level? You know, that should be standard, right?" But you have to remember that a lot of these kids are starting at, um, very substandard level. So grade three or four, and so on average they've maybe gained at most a half a grade level each year. 

00:17:55
JOAN LEISHMAN So that was a big improvement, really. 

00:18:00
ALLISON CAMERON The only subject area that we didn't see big gains was math. So that's something that I'd like to look into for next year. 

00:18:10
JOAN LEISHMAN When you look at the, uh, overall results. What surprised you most? 

00:18:10
Allison Cameron Teacher 

00:18:10
ALLISON CAMERON Behavior, I think. We're seeing a lot, a lot of added benefits with the behavior and the attention. And for us, I think the academics is certainly a bonus, I know that that's the easiest thing to measure. So, um, we've definitely got some good proof that it's, or research to support that it's (crosstalk) been... 

00:18:35
JOAN LEISHMAN (crosstalk) Academic improvement. 

00:18:35
ALLISON CAMERON Right. But the behavior, especially for the kids at City Park, has been what I find to be the most rewarding. We're having some parents, um, at interviews saying, "You know, my child is, you know, doing much better at home now. And, um, yeah, they're eating better. They're encouraging us to go for walks around the neighborhood." So, you know, it, it means a lot when you've got these kids coming to school now saying, "I feel much better and it's because, you know, of this program." 

00:19:05
JOAN LEISHMAN What are the plans for, uh, the program next year? 

00:19:05
ALLISON CAMERON Uh, we're definitely going to continue on with it. The grade eights and grade nines, all of them, will do Jog Your Memory, for sure. And we're hoping that we can expand it into the grade 10's. It's got tons and tons of awareness for the program. Teachers are really excited about it. It looks like it, it could expand very quickly. Have any other schools or teachers, kind of, picked up on the idea since the program aired? 

00:19:30
ALLISON CAMERON We've had a lot of interest. We had a lot of emails, um, with schools really interested in doing this. Um, and we've got, um, quite a few schools from all over Canada, North America very interested. While I'm in town, I'm going to meet with, um, hopefully some people to see if we can expand it out this way, so. 

00:19:55
JOAN LEISHMAN Wonderful. 

00:19:55
ALLISON CAMERON Mm-hmm. 

00:19:55
JOAN LEISHMAN Good. Well, thank you so much. 

00:19:55
ALLISON CAMERON Thank you. 

00:19:55
NARRATOR Exercise is good for the brain, very good it seems. At least that was the outcome of an innovative program Joan Leishman told us about last night. It's a pilot program at Saskatoon's City Park collegiate high school. Now we invited your comments and questions, and you responded in droves. But in case you missed it, here's a short excerpt from Joan's documentary. 

00:20:20
JOAN LEISHMAN Monday morning math class, where the first thing grade nine students do is strap on a heart monitor. 

00:20:25
ALLISON CAMERON Good morning, you guys. Please make sure your heart rates are at 134. Keep it there. 

00:20:35
JOAN LEISHMAN For 20 minutes the kids workout on exercise equipment right in the classroom. 

00:20:40
ALLISON CAMERON But once a week I'd like to see you guys challenging yourself in a different way. Challenging different parts of your brain, different parts of your body.

JOAN LEISHMAN After what is for some a grueling start to the day, it's time for the second half of math class. And this is when you notice that something very different is going on. They're concentrating and working hard. Nobody's swearing or running around. When before some students could barely sit still for 10 or 15 minutes. 

00:21:20
NARRATOR Joan Leishman is, uh, with me again tonight. Uh, Joan, it's not only that they were concentrating more, but also getting much better marks because of the exercise they were doing. And tell us about the response. People have really, really, uh, locked in on this idea. 

00:21:35
Joan Leishman CBC News 

00:21:35
JOAN LEISHMAN You're right, the response has been overwhelming. Probably more to this story than any other story I've ever done. Um, we had letters from teachers, students, doctors, and certainly parents. They had a variety of questions, um, some were very specific. Will this work for students who have, say, ADHD? Or, how do we set up a program? Um, but one question that kept coming up over and over and over again was, how do you motivate kids? 

00:21:55
NARRATOR Right. 

00:21:55
We have many students who refuse to participate during gym class. Exercise programs we have tried to implement have been popular with the students at first, but interest quickly wanes. How did you motivate your students to engage in the program and stick with it? Jennifer Weber 

00:21:55
JOAN LEISHMAN And keep them motivated? Um, one teacher from, um, a teacher store (ph) named Jennifer Weber, she sent in this question. We have many students who refuse to participate during gym class. Exercise programs we have tried to implement have been popular but students quickly, uh, lose interest. How did you motivate your students and engage them in a program like this and stick with it? So we put that question to Allison Cameron today and here's her response. 

00:22:25
ALLISON CAMERON I found that the key to getting my students motivated last year was to get on the treadmills with them. There's nothing kids love more than to challenge their teachers. So the kids would get on beside me and say, "Okay, let's race." And I loved racing against them. They loved racing against me and their buddy next to them. So once Barney or any of the students bought in, you know, it was kind of a trickle down effect. The next one would go, and the next one, and soon we would have the whole class bought in, and doing their 20 minutes. But another key was to start out slowly. Some students couldn't do 20 minutes all at once. That was really daunting. So the key was for some students, to start at five minutes and we'd build our way up to 20 minutes. 'Coz otherwise, it was too overwhelming and they were walking out the door. 

00:23:15
NARRATOR Joan, as we saw there was some great results here for, for this particular class. What I wanna know, uh, it works great for teenagers. Will it work for adults, as well? 

00:23:25
Joan Leishman CBC News 

00:23:25
JOAN LEISHMAN Well, this is all new science, just how exercise affects the brain, you know, the results are just coming out now. But there are some early studies that, um, Dr. John Ratey, the Harvard psychiatrist who was in our piece, studies that he talked about. For example, if you take a 55 or a middle-aged, uh, person who is sedentary, they start out on exercise regimes say four or five times a week, then it reduces their risk of Alzheimer's by half. 

00:23:50
NARRATOR Wow. 

00:23:50
JOAN LEISHMAN It also, um, would delay cognitive degeneration by 10 to 15 years. So those are early studies, but they're pretty remarkable. 

00:24:05
NARRATOR Indeed, well it was a remarkable story. It was really great work. And we'll be posting more of Allison Cameron's answers to your questions on our website tomorrow at noon eastern. Check that out.
