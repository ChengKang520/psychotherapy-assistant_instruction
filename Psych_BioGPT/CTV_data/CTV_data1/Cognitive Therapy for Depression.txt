BRIEF THERAPY 

00:00:55
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:00:55
and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal, and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategist in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people, with real life problems.

COGNITIVE THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION 

00:01:45
JUUDITH BECK THERAPIST 

00:01:45
1-1 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Hi. I'm Jon Carlson. Welcome to 'Brief Therapy Inside Out.' 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest Judith Beck who's going to talk to us today about cognitive brief therapy. Judith I was, I'm interested in your idea of what is brief therapy? How long is it? How do we define brief therapy? 

00:02:15
JUDITH BECK Well, I think cognitive therapy actually ties to be time sensitive. And that is, we try to help patients overcome their disorders, and stay better in as brief a time as we can. For easy patients like the one that we'll be watching in a few minutes, we might see that patient for someplace between 12 and 14-sessions. For a more difficult patient, especially one who might have a comorbid access to diagnosis, we might see the patient for a year or maybe a little bit more. 

00:02:40
Judith Beck, Ph. D. 

00:02:45
JON CARLSON Well just what is your therapy approach? The strategies that you use? 

00:02:50
JUDITH BECK Well there are several components that are really important to cognitive therapy. One is that cognitive therapy tends to be very structured. 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:02:55
JUDITH BECK We tend to follow the same kind of format for most patients in most sessions, because we find that's how we get the most done. That's the most efficient use of time. A second important component is that we have a cognitive conceptualization of the patient. We are always thinking to ourselves, 'How is it that the patient got to this point? What are the patients most, uh, basic beliefs about herself?' 

00:03:20
Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D., ABPP 

00:03:20
JON CARLSON So there's a thinking emphasis. 

00:03:20
JUDITH BECK Very strong thinking emphasis. Both in understanding the underlining beliefs the patient has, and also the thinking in the specific situations today that are causing her problems. 

00:03:30
JON CARLSON Just how does this structure work? Can you kind of give us a kind of thumb nail sketch of the process? 

00:03:35
JUDITH BECK Sure. First we usually do a mood check. So we have a sense of whether the patient has made progress since we first started therapy. And get a sense of how the past week was. Then we usually set an agenda, and we ask the patient, 'What problem do you want to work on today?' So we get the patient to be very specific about something that she wants help with. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:03:55
JUDITH BECK Then we usually make a bridge from the previous session to this current session. We might ask the patient, 'What does she remember from the previous session that was important? Uh, what happened during the week that the therapist needs to know? What kind of homework did she get done.' And this is very important if we suspect that the patient might have had a negative reaction to the previous session, we might ask, 'What did you think about the last session? Was there anything that bothered you? Or, 'Did it bother you particularly when I did so-and-so?' 

00:04:20
JON CARLSON So there's a lot of feedback that you solicit from the client. 

00:04:25
JUDITH BECK There is, throughout the session. The beginning part of the session has these kinds of components. Then the middle part of the session, usually we start with one problem and do a culmination of some problem solving, and then teaching the patient some skills that she needs in order to solve this problem. And hopefully skills that she'll use for the rest of her life. 

00:04:45
JON CARLSON So, it's directed then? 

00:04:50
JUDITH BECK It is. 

00:04:50
JON CARLSON So it's collaborative, it's directive? 

00:04:55
JUDITH BECK In the last part of the session we try to have the patient summarize what she got out of the session and then give the therapist some feedback. And we try to figure out what the patient needs to do this co-, this current week, this coming week I should say. 

00:05:05
JON CARLSON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:05
JUDITH BECK In order to move ahead with her problems. 

00:05:10
JON CARLSON So then there's a homework assignment that's given. A very directive homework assignment? 

00:05:15
JUDITH BECK It's usually collaboratively set, so one of the things I might say to the patient is, 'Okay we just discussed this problem that you have with being more independent. What kinds of things would you like to try this week?' Or if I had some ideas or if she was stuck I might suggest, 'What do you think about doing this, or doing that?' 

00:05:30
JON CARLSON You don't do this imbedded hidden message kind of uh, approach to these suggestions? Are they forthright and straightforward? 

00:05:40
JUDITH BECK Yes. We're very straightforward, and usually they have something to do with solving a particular problem, or helping the patient practice something that, some skill that she learned in therapy. 

00:05:50
DIANE KJOS And it sounds like you're both following the client in somewhat leading at the same time, or directing. 

00:05:55
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

00:05:55
JUDITH BECK That's right. There's always kind of tension in the session between having the patient on and on so that you can get enough data about a problem and conceptualize it, and then stopping the patient and making an intervention. And so really the art of therapy I think is being able to um, resolve this tension and do as much work in as efficient as a manner as possible. But also in an as effective as a matter as possible. 

00:06:25
JON CARLSON May-, may-, yeah, maybe you can help me understand just how does change occur in this model? That's the process that goes through, but . . . 

00:06:30
JUDITH BECK Well, I think that change occurs very directly. So one of the things that we do is to help patients learn a system for evaluating their thoughts. Because we know that when people are psychologically distressed, they often have thoughts that are quite distorted. Now rather than telling them that they need to change their thoughts, what we try to do is to teach them how to evaluate their thoughts themselves. Sometimes the thoughts however turn out to be true. And then in that case we need to do some straight problem solving, which involves change. Uh, sometimes the um, problem has more to do with their perception of a situation. In which case then we teach them this very specific cognitive change. 

00:07:10
JON CARLSON So then, change takes place by teaching them how to assess their thinking? 

00:07:15
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON And then, how to change the way that they think? 

00:07:20
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON Th-, that . . . 

00:07:20
JUDITH BECK And also in changing their behavior. Often times we find that patients are really deficient in problem solving skills or social skills or work related skills. And we very directly teach them . . . 

00:07:30
JON CARLSON So there is the . . . 

00:07:30
JUDITH BECK . . . how to . . . 

00:07:30
JON CARLSON . . .behavioral component . . . 

00:07:35
JUDITH BECK . . . be different. Oh yes. 

00:07:35
JON CARLSON . . .to this. 

00:07:35
DIANE KJOS What influenced you to be a cognitive therapist, and can you tell me a little bit of a background on , on, . . . 

00:07:45
JON CARLSON You mean what, or do you mean who? 

00:07:45
DIANE KJOS Do I mean what or who? Well I was going to let her tell us that. 

00:07:50
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:07:50
JUDITH BECK I never thought that I would be a psychologist. I started off as a teacher, I wanted to be a teacher ever since I was five years old. Never had a thought about going into psychology at all. Um, and didn't really have a thought about going in to it until I was in graduate school in education and bo-, actually both of my parents suggested that I should give therapy a try. Give cognitive therapy specifically a try. As you know my father is Aaron Beck, who developed this for of therapy. And I decided to, to listen to them. I think happily so, and give it a try. I think one of the reasons I never really thought about being a psychologist was that I was always a very good intuitive teacher. It just came very naturally to me about how to teach kids, how to teach other people. And I didn't realize, it's kind of a naïve idea looking back at it, that one could learn how to be a psychologist and a therapist. You didn't have to be born with an intuitive knowledge of that. That there are actually steps that you can take to learn it. 

00:08:50
DIANE KJOS Well and certainly you are doing a lot of intuitive work. Uh, we talk of being an intuitive teacher . . . 

00:08:55
JUDITH BECK That's right. Well interestingly enough I think the intuitiveness came later. First I had to spend, as most people do, an enormous amount of time learning how to conceptualize patients. 

00:09:10
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
JUDITH BECK Learning how to structure sessions. Learning how to do different interventions. And I think I probably didn't realize when I was first doing therapy how important it is to be in tune with the affective experience of the patient as she's sitting across from you. And once I be, once I realized that, uh, then I became much more intuitive, and I began using her non-verbal ques for tone of voice and so forth. As a guide to what I should do next in therapy. 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON Is this approach, I mean, when you talking about which you had to learn, is there a research base to the work that you do? 

00:09:45
JUDITH BECK Oh yes. There have been over 150 clinical trials, controlled trials that show that cognitive therapy is a effective for a whole range of disorders. From depression, to substance abuse, to eating disorders, um, personality disorders, even schizophrenia we're finding as an adjunct to medication . . . 

00:10:00
JON CARLSON So there's outcome that supports the work with specific clients. And are there process research that's then to would indicate that you should do this particular kind of uh, cognitive therapy technique or procedure in a certain instance. 

00:10:20
JUDITH BECK There's been much less research on that. There have been some studies which have tried to dismantle cognitive therapy to see what are the prime components. 

00:10:25
JON CARLSON Yes, that's what I was wondering. 

00:10:25
JUDITH BECK But the bulk of the research has really been on its efficacy. And in fact that I think that the intuitive part of cognitive therapy, the understanding what the patient is experiencing as she's sitting across from you is an incredibly important part of the therapy itself. It's really the art of cognitive therapy. Which is why um, the dismantling studies I think do a little bit disservice. You lose that very important part. 

00:10:55
DIANE KJOS How does this, how does this compare with other brief therapies? Is it like some or different, um, what's, where would you out it? 

00:11:05
JUDITH BECK Well I think its different in several really important ways. One is that it's very structured. And I think that it being structured is of course very important if you only have a few sessions with the patient. The second thing is, it's very problem solving oriented. So at every session you try to take a problem or a part of a problem and really start solving that. The third is that we try to use the um, what the patient brings up right in the therapy session. The problems that she's had in the past week, or the problems she's going to have in the next week. As important targets to focus on. And then do this combinations of both problem solving and helping patients learn the skills of evaluating their thoughts and learning behavioral skills and so forth. We do it in a very direct way. That most patients really like, it just makes sense to them to do it in this way. We also are very collaborative with patients. And so together we make the important um decisions in therapy such as what to talk about doing this session, what homework to assign. If there is not an, um, externally imposed limit on the number of sessions, how long we should meet, when we should go from once a week to once every two weeks and so forth. 

00:12:10
DIANE KJOS Are there clients that it doesn't work with? Are there particular clients that . . . 

00:12:15
JUDITH BECK You know it's interesting when my father first developed this therapy in the 1960s he developed it for patients with major depression, and he says at that time he really had no idea whether or not it applied to any other disorders. He just assumed that it was really made for depression. Um, after it worked so well with depression, and there was a really important outcome study to show how, that it was actually more effective than medication for depressed patients. He and his colleagues applied it to anxiety disorders. And then a new generation of people including I came along and applied it to a whole range of both outpatient and inpatient disorders. Including endogenous depression and as I mentioned before schizophrenia. So we don't really know the limits of therapy. One of the things that we do know is that the therapy has to have a different focus and a different orientation for each disorder. So the way that I treat a depressed patient might be quite different from the way that I treat a panic disorder patient. What remains the same is the cognitive conceptualization, how I think about patients. 

00:13:20
JON CARLSON Can we talk about the cognitive conceptualization a little bit? What's that basic formula that makes this approach work? 

00:13:25
JUDITH BECK Well, the, the formulation really has two important parts. One is looking at the patient's present life, and seeing whether the typical situations that cause her a lot distress, and then we do a kind of cross sectional analysis. We look for the thoughts that the patient is having in those situations, and then the resultant reaction. Emotional reaction, behavioral reaction, and the physiological reaction. If there is one. So that's kind of looking at the current. Then, now this is especially important with access to patients, we want to go back and to see. . . 

00:14:00
JON CARLSON (inaudible )personality disorder, character disorder. 

00:14:03
JUDITH BECK Personality disorder patients. Right. We want to go back and see what are the patients most basic beliefs about herself and her world and other people. Um, make them . . . 

00:14:15
JON CARLSON A core belief or what Adlerian's might call lifestyle beliefs? 

00:14:15
JUDITH BECK Exactly. And it's these beliefs that make it evident why it is that the patient is having these kinds of thoughts and reactions to current situations. We might go back and look at what kind of things happened to the patient in childhood that caused this belief to start. And what kinds of events or traumas happened that help maintain the belief. And then we say, 'How did the patient cope with these beliefs all her life. What kind of behavioral strategies did she develop?' 

00:14:40
JON CARLSON They go back to one of those mistake in their faulty beliefs. What would be an example of that? 

00:14:45
JUDITH BECK Um, I think you'll see in the patient that um, will come up in a few minutes, think she probably have a belief that she's helpless and inadequate. 

00:14:55
JON CARLSON That would be the core belief? 

00:14:55
JUDITH BECK The core belief about herself. 

00:15:00
JON CARLSON And how does that come out? What's the automatic thinking, the automatic response that she might have? 

00:15:00
JUDITH BECK Well, when she's in a particular situation such as thinking, uh, about whether or not her mother is going to be with her for a long time or die soon, she has the thought, 'If I don't get independent before my mother dies, then I might not make it.' So there's really a sense that she doesn't feel as if she's a strong, independent, effective person. Rather the opposite that often time she sees herself as ineffective, incapable, helpless. 

00:15:35
Judith Beck, Ph.D. 

00:15:35
JON CARLSON And then she acts that way. 

00:15:40
JUDITH BECK That's right. And often times them what happens is she relies too much on her mother or her sisters or other people. Instead of going ahead and doing the things that she knows kind of in her heart that she needs to do. 

00:15:45
JON CARLSON So how do you change those deeper core beliefs? I can see how you might change some of the more beliefs in the present, but how do you deal with the deeper ones? 

00:15:55
JUDITH BECK Well, initially we tackle the deeper ones after the patients have learned the skills of evaluating their automatic thoughts in uh, around current situations. Then we help them apply some of the same techniques, the same kind of questions to see to what degree this core belief is accurate or not. Often times what we find is that patients will then begin to change this belief at the intellectual level, but not necessarily the gut level. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON Right, right. 

00:16:25
JUDITH BECK They'll say, 'You know I know intellectually I'm not really helpless or inadequate, but in my gut I still feel that way.' And that's when we will sometimes use more experiential kinds of techniques. Perhaps having the patient uh, recall some early childhood memories in which she felt helpless or inadequate. And use various interventions to try to change the meaning of those memories. And perhaps help her that that, uh, the reality was that she was not completely helpless and inadequate at that point. Maybe she was just acting like a normal kid, but who was thrown into some difficult circumstances. 

00:16:55
JON CARLSON And you need to do that though to change that core belief before you would terminate treatment. 

00:17:00
JUDITH BECK Ideally you do. With um, straightforward access one patients who do not have a personality disorder, often times that belief work can be fairly quick. And uh, just by working at the automatic thought level that you can see at current situations that the core belief is not true. And then the core belief itself flips back to where it was before the depression started. Which is usually fairly a healthy more equal, more um, realistic belief. 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON So in some cases this can be done s-, quite quickly. 

00:17:35
JUDITH BECK That's right. It's in the access, the more severely disordered access to patients where the belief change takes longer. 

00:17:40
JON CARLSON Hm. 

00:17:40
DIANE KJOS What about cultural differences, does that play a part in this? And. . . 

00:17:45
JUDITH BECK Well it's very important. The, just as we have to, um, change the therapy according to the patient's diagnosis, we also have to alter the therapy according to their cultural background and their degrees of comfort. Some patients really like to have a very structured session. Other patients get very uncomfortable with that. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're from a different culture, but sometimes, um, sometimes that's why. And so the therapist has to be really attuned to what's going on in the patient as she's sitting there. Sometimes her beliefs are more culturally based beliefs. So she might have uh, a patient might have a belief, 'If I stand up to my parents it will be a sign of disrespect.' That may be something that she learned in her culture. And the therapist needs to be aware of that cultural belief. And often times just labeling that as a cultural belief, and then, it allows the patient to look at it more objectively. 

00:18:40
JON CARLSON In a few minutes we're going to watch you work with a young woman. Prior to the interview, what goes on inside? 

00:18:50
JUDITH BECK Well, um, not necessarily with this patient, because this was just the first time I had seen her, but with an ongoing patient I always take a few minutes before the patient walks in the door to review what we had done in the previous session. How far the patient had come since she first came to therapy. What her overall goals are with therapy. Um, where I hope to get her to in this specific session. And I also look if there is a time constraint, how many sessions we have left. Um, and then I kind of review my conceptualization. What are her, the most central beliefs in behavioral strategies that are causing her trouble. Remind myself of those, so that if there's a choice which she doesn't have a strong choice between one or two problems to bring up, I probably would steer her toward the on that's more centrally connected. 

00:19:40
JON CARLSON You give her the depression inventory. Would you talk a little bit about what that was about? And what kinds thoughts that brought to you that sort of brought to you before you started working with her. 

00:19:50
JUDITH BECK Well, we actually um, give our patients three forms before every single session. Depression inventory, anxiety inventory, and hopelessness scale. And this collects a great deal of information for the therapist in a very short period of time. So by looking at the total score I can see how the patient objectively has been doing compared to other weeks. And especially compared to when she first came in. And then looking at some of the individual items are also very important. And I can uncover some problems that we might need to address that the patient might not bring up directly unless I asked about them. Most importantly about suicide. We always look at the hopeless side of suicidal item as well. 

00:20:30
JON CARLSON So prior to the interview you reschool yourself refresh just who this person is you review the data that they've just given you to know where they are . . . 

00:20:40
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:20:40
JON CARLSON . . . prior to the session. And so you really begin therapy already running, already moving forward. 

00:20:45
JUDITH BECK With, with a game plan. That might have to be adjusted of course for what the patient says when she first comes in, but at least I have an idea of where we are starting and where I want to get to by the end of the session. 

00:21:00
JON CARLSON And as we watch this interview, what should we look at? What should we look for? 

00:21:05
JUDITH BECK I think there's . . . 

00:21:05
JON CARLSON I said it up front first, if you can? 

00:21:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah, there's several things. One is just to see the structure of the interview, because this is a fairly typical interview where we're checking the mood, setting an agenda, um, discussing uh, and important problem. Teaching the patient some skills. Um, giving a homework assignment. Summarizing and getting feed back. So that's one part. I think the second part to look at is the affective shifts in the patient. You can see as she's feeling very depressed and overwhelmed, and then suddenly she looks brighter. And to try to figure our, uh, when she's looking brighter, what has been the cognitive change? And I think underlining most of these shifts is a feeling of being less helpless. Less inadequate. And I'm always looking for opportunities through the tape to undermine these beliefs that I hypothesize these beliefs that are there about inadequacy and helplessness. 

00:22:00
JON CARLSON I think it would also be important if the viewers watch how you do that. How carefully you challenge some of these dependent personality issues she has through empowering her. And really getting her to see the strength she has within herself. You did that frequently throughout the interview. 

00:22:20
JUDITH BECK Yeah, and one difficulty I had with her, was that she was agreeing with me too quickly. 

00:22:25
DIANE KJOS Yes, yes. 

00:22:25
JUDITH BECK And I had the sense that I had started to make a little movement, but that it was unrealistic to expect that she had really changed her thinking that much. Um, in, in any given segment, so that's why I think you'll often times see me going deeper, and really um, trying to assess to what degree she really believed in her gut what I was saying, and how much she was trying to please me. 

00:22:50
JON CARLSON I think we're all excited about this interview, let's let the viewers watch. 

00:22:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. Yes, thank you for coming in tonight. Okay, if this were a regular session, I, um, regular therapy, what I'd do is to have you come in for an evaluation first where I'd ask you a lot of questions to find out exactly what your diagnosis was and how the problems developed and um, what your symptoms are. But if we do that tonight we won't any chance to do therapy. 

00:23:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. So I'm just going to jump right in. 

00:23:20
LATRICE Okay. 

00:23:20
JUDITH BECK It was very helpful that you filled out this depression inventory. And you have a score of 41. 

00:23:25
LATRICE Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
JUDITH BECK Which usually indicates that the depression is in the severe range. 

00:23:30
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:23:30
JUDITH BECK How long have you been feeling like this? 

00:23:35
LATRICE Uh, I, since December of 1996. 

00:23:40
JUDITH BECK Oh, what was going on then? 

00:23:40
LATRICE Um, I lost my brother. 

00:23:45
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
LATRICE And, I, um, was just starting to do a lot of erratic things. Things I thought were erratic. 

00:23:50
JUDITH BECK Such as? 

00:23:55
LATRICE Uh, I was arrested and convicted and . . . 

00:24:00
JUDITH BECK For what? 

00:24:00
LATRICE Delivery of controlled substance, 

00:24:00
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
LATRICE And it just changed my life a whole lot. 

00:24:05
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Have you say you got depressed then? 

00:24:10
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:24:10
JUDITH BECK And you've been depressed ever since. 

00:24:15
LATRICE I think so. 

00:24:15
JUDITH BECK Now, what I like to do at the beginning of sessions is to set an agenda, so that's what I want to do with you tonight. 

00:24:20
LATRICE Okay. 

00:24:20
JUDITH BECK And that's to review what problems you're having, and then to pick one or maybe two of them to go over. 

00:24:30
LATRICE Okay. 

00:24:30
JUDITH BECK So can you tell me a little bit about what's going on in your life now? What are some problems you might want to work on tonight. 

00:24:35
LATRICE Um, right now I think the biggest problem I'm having is okay I work part time, even though I have two, three children like I said, and um, I was finally felt like I was really ready to get out on my own and raise them in my own household. And it has just been a struggle trying to find affordable housing for myself. 

00:24:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:24:55
LATRICE And, I think just coping every day with uh, by living with my mother, my father's been gone a year now. Over a year now. And just the grief the ongoing grief is just comes and goes and it's like you never know. And . . . 

00:25:15
JUDITH BECK Your mom's grief or your grief? 

00:25:15
LATRICE Both of ours. 

00:25:15
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. And grief over? 

00:25:15
LATRICE Over my father and brother's death. 

00:25:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. And you said coping with your mother? 

00:25:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:25:25
JUDITH BECK Tell me more about that. 

00:25:25
LATRICE Well, um, my mom, I mean she has helped me a lot and she has done so much for me, but I feel sometimes when, like sometimes she's just could be having a bad day over it. And I could be in a better mood than I was before, and then if I see her, in it, grieving or just unsure then it makes me scared and kind of unsure. 

00:25:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:25:55
LATRICE And so it, I have to deal with that day to day I don't know what each day is going to be like. And I know they're all different, but it's like, I don't know. 

00:26:10
JUDITH BECK So, when you feel scared and unsure when you see your mom's grief. 

00:26:15
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:26:15
JUDITH BECK And then another piece of this seems to be kind of what will today bring? 

00:26:20
LATRICE Yes. 

00:26:20
JUDITH BECK And when you're feeling really depressed, what do you think today is going to bring. 

00:26:25
LATRICE I don't know. 

00:26:25
JUDITH BECK Problems as opposed to happy . . . 

00:26:30
LATRICE Um . . . 

00:26:30
JUDITH BECK . . .moments? 

00:26:30
LATRICE Sometimes it's like uh, I'm, I just, I think that I, I'm just wishing that it's better. 

00:26:40
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:26:40
LATRICE Hoping that it gets better at some point. 

00:26:45
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. And when you say wishing it would get better, what's the if? 

00:26:50
LATRICE Just uh, feeling so burdened by so many thing. 

00:26:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Well what kinds of things? 

00:27:00
LATRICE Um, well, being a parent is tough. 

00:27:00
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:27:00
LATRICE Being a mom is tough. 

00:27:05
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. That's true. 

00:27:05
LATRICE So I feel that sort of burden and then feeling that I, I, I feel like I do have an obligation to my mother . . . 

00:27:10
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:27:10
LATRICE . . .she's moving into her senior years. Senior citizen years. And I come from a large family. And I just feel kind of burdened to meet expectations. What is expected of me, and . . . 

00:27:35
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:27:35
LATRICE Sometimes it's not easy. 

00:27:35
JUDITH BECK And these expectations are what kinds of things? 

00:27:40
LATRICE Um, finishing college. 

00:27:40
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:27:40
LATRICE Um, just, I, I think my mother was a great mother to us. She had 11-children and . . . 

00:27:55
JUDITH BECK Wow. 

00:27:55
LATRICE I can s-, just see it's just the vast difference between us. I always say at the time, and um, I would like to be more like her in a sense of being a mother to my kids . . . 

00:28:05
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:28:05
LATRICE You know, being a parent. She was there all the time. She was a homemaker, so I think that there's a big difference, it makes a big difference. 

00:28:15
JUDITH BECK Oh, sure. So you work part time, did I see as a cashier? 

00:28:20
LATRICE Yes, I work part time, and I'm a full time student. 

00:28:20
JUDITH BECK And a full time student? 

00:28:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:28:25
JUDITH BECK So it's understandable that you'd feel burdened. But maybe there's something we can do about that to try to lift the burden a little bit. Any other problems that you haven't mentioned already. 

00:28:30
LATRICE Um. 

00:28:30
JUDITH BECK Any other problems with work or other relationships? 

00:28:35
LATRICE Um, no I would like a better job, but I feel I guess I just have to better my skills and stuff . . . 

00:28:45
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:28:45
LATRICE . . . but well work, working there now I, I like it. 

00:28:50
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:28:50
LATRICE Because I feel that um, in a nice environment of people. Coworkers. But, I really wish I could do better. 

00:29:00
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And how about other relationships? Any problems there with friends? Family members? 

00:29:05
LATRICE Well friends, I don't, I don't really feel like I have friends right now. Not many, but one or two, and one friend has been um, friends with me for a while um she has been a great friend. 

00:29:20
JUDITH BECK And do you wish you had more friends? Or are you okay with what you have? 

00:29:25
LATRICE I think I'm okay with that. 

00:29:25
JUDITH BECK Well let me go through the problems that you mentioned. And then we;ll maybe we can pick one out to start working on. 

00:29:30
LATRICE Okay. 

00:29:30
JUDITH BECK So the first thing is the housing problem. And I'm not sure I have much to offer you on that, but just maybe more of a practical thing. 

00:29:35
LATRICE Right. Right. 

00:29:35
JUDITH BECK Second thing is coping better with your mother. And especially when you get to a spiral where you're mother's feeling a lot of grief and then you start to feel unsure and scared. So that's one thing that we can talk about. Then another thing we could talk about is feeling burdened by your role as a parent. 

00:29:55
LATRICE Okay. 

00:29:55
JUDITH BECK And then the third thing we could talk about is feeling obligated to your mom. 

00:30:05
LATRICE Okay. 

00:30:05
JUDITH BECK And I guess there's a fourth thing is meeting families expectations for finishing college and so forth. 

00:30:10
LATRICE Right. 

00:30:10
JUDITH BECK It sounds as if maybe your comparing yourself to some of your other brothers and sisters. 

00:30:15
LATRICE Well, I do, because you hear it a lot. I hear it a lot about me still being at home with my mother. I get the comparisons a lot. 

00:30:25
JUDITH BECK Right. So which one of those would you like to talk about tonight? 

00:30:30
LATRICE Um, I think the dealing with the grief with my mom and it. 

00:30:30
JUDITH BECK Okay, now did this kind of situation come up this very week? Where your mom was having a lot of grief and then you started to feel scared and unsure? 

00:30:40
LATRICE Yes. 

00:30:40
JUDITH BECK Can you remember when that was? 

00:30:45
LATRICE It was Tuesday morning I believe. 

00:30:45
JUDITH BECK Okay, so tell me a little bit about what was happening. 

00:30:50
LATRICE Um, I was uh, I was feeling, I thought I was, I was feeling okay, and um I was uh, preparing myself to leave for school and uh sh-, my mother she just, she just, she's a real nice and sweet person, but when she's fitting to have a bad day . . . 

00:31:10
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:31:10
LATRICE . . .it's automatic you know it as soon as sh-, you see her. And um, it's like I don't know I think I left a paper towel or something out and she just s-, was like I ca-, 'I'm tired of picking up. I'm doing,' it was just uh, I don't know where it came from . . . 

00:31:30
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:31:30
LATRICE . . . sort of, but it just came out and . . . 

00:31:35
JUDITH BECK She started yelling at you or criticizing you or . . . 

00:31:40
LATRICE Criticizing a lot. 

00:31:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah, yeah. And you ended up feeling emotionally sad, or scared, or unsure, what was the emotion? 

00:31:45
LATRICE All of those? 

00:31:50
JUDITH BECK All of those? 

00:31:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:31:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Now, what was, what went through your mind when she said, she started criticizing you for leaving paper towels out. 

00:32:00
LATRICE That if I was a mom, I wouldn't have the . . . 

00:32:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:32:05
LATRICE . . . listen to her criticize me about the paper towels. 

00:32:05
JUDITH BECK Right, so if I were in my own place I wouldn't have to listen to this. 

00:32:10
LATRICE Right, you know I could at least deal with . . . 

00:32:10
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:32:10
LATRICE . . . it, see how she's doing and then go home. 

00:32:15
JUDITH BECK That's right. And did you have a particul-, any thoughts that were particularly sad? 

00:32:20
LATRICE Um, I, I just thought about, I, how much she missed my father. 

00:32:25
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

00:32:25
LATRICE And that I really felt sad about just, it really didn't dawn on me, I don't think, in all this year that how much she could really be missing him . . . 

00:32:35
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:32:35
LATRICE . . . and how much she could actually be feeling for him. 

00:32:40
JUDITH BECK So you had thoughts like, 'She must really miss my father. She must be lonely.' 

00:32:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:32:45
JUDITH BECK And those thoughts were connected to the sadness? 

00:32:45
LATRICE Yes. 

00:32:45
JUDITH BECK What thoughts do you think were connected with feeling scared and unsure? 

00:32:50
LATRICE I thought that, just seeing her, just seeing she seems so different now. She just, she seemed real, real sure patient now, and what made me scared is just the thought of losing her and just the thought of if I was wondering, 'Okay, if I, if my dad l-, when my dad died I lost, I feel like I lost a lot of things. I don't know.' 

00:33:25
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:33:25
LATRICE Seems like things just started to go away, I don't, and with her I feel, I was just scared that I don't know, I'm, I'm just in a, I just feel scared. 

00:33:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:33:40
LATRICE I feel like that I might loose her, and it scares me a lot. 

00:33:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And what's your thought, 'If I loose her, then what' What's the word . . . 

00:33:45
LATRICE That if I lose her . . . 

00:33:50
JUDITH BECK What are you afraid would happen? 

00:33:50
LATRICE I won't have anybody in my, on my side. 

00:33:55
JUDITH BECK If I lose her I won't have anybody on my side and then, what are you afraid will happen then? 

00:34:00
LATRICE I'm afraid that I don't know what I'm going to do. That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know. I don't know what would happen to me if I make it. That's what . . . 

00:34:10
JUDITH BECK So you have the thought, 'I might not make it.' 

00:34:10
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:34:10
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And do you have an image or a picture in your head of not making it? 

00:34:20
LATRICE Um . . . 

00:34:25
JUDITH BECK Do you kind of see yourself in the future not making it in some way? 

00:34:30
LATRICE Uh, without her it's uh . . . 

00:34:35
JUDITH BECK When you think of the future, and you're scared that you-, she might not be in your future, where do you see yourself? Do you see yourself in the same place you're living now? 

00:34:40
LATRICE No. 

00:34:40
JUDITH BECK Where do you see yourself? 

00:34:45
LATRICE Um, I don't know. I don't, I don't really see myself like anywhere that would, that makes me feel good. I don't, I don't know. 

00:35:00
JUDITH BECK You see yourself on the street or . . . 

00:35:00
LATRICE Um. 

00:35:00
JUDITH BECK Being alone someplace? 

00:35:05
LATRICE It's, it's not, I don't think I;m out on the streets. I don't see myself on the streets, I seem myself like just not doing as well. 

00:35:15
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. And feeling unhappy? 

00:35:15
LATRICE Yes. 

00:35:20
JUDITH BECK Uh, finding it harder to cope? 

00:35:20
LATRICE Yes. 

00:35:20
JUDITH BECK You don't see yourself in this specific physical place. 

00:35:25
LATRICE Um, physically um, no. I see myself in Chicago. That's it, but it, it, it, and I always said, I always said that I don't want to move back there. But I always see myself back in Chicago. 

00:35:40
JUDITH BECK I see. And where in Chicago is that? 

00:35:45
LATRICE Uh, the west, well we grew up, where I grew up. 

00:35:45
JUDITH BECK So you have this thought I might not make it, do you see yourself back in the place where you grew up? 

00:35:50
LATRICE Yes. 

00:35:50
JUDITH BECK Being unhappy, not coping very well. 

00:35:55
LATRICE Yes. 

00:35:55
JUDITH BECK Feeling really continue to feel very burdened and . . . 

00:36:00
LATRICE Yes. 

00:36:00
JUDITH BECK Not very effective? 

00:36:00
LATRICE Yes. 

00:36:00
JUDITH BECK Okay. Well it's understandable then why you would feel so scared if you have that kind of image. Now when your mom was criticizing you for the paper towel. Did you, do you think you had that picture in your mind? Did it kind of flash through your mind? Of you being back in Chicago, or is that something you just thought of now. 

00:36:20
LATRICE Well, um no I kind of, I think that I have thought of, I thought of about that. That would, that when I think back on the times I thought well, if I lose her, what's going to happen to me. I always like I always see myself back in Chicago, but the day when she was criticizing me about the paper towel, I don't know I was so confused I don't, I don't really remember . . . 

00:36:45
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:36:45
LATRICE That's another thing. I'm having trouble with a lot of times, just remembering simple things like that. I don't really remember um, exactly, you know, what, how my thoughts played out. 

00:37:00
JUDITH BECK That's fine. But this is a typical kind of image that . . . 

00:37:00
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:37:00
JUDITH BECK you have is that you're back in Chicago where you grew up and not doing as well? 

00:37:05
LATRICE Right. 

00:37:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Now just as an aside, do you know why you're having more problems with your memory now? 

00:37:10
LATRICE Um, I just, I think if I don't get enough sleep . . . 

00:37:15
JUDITH BECK That's probably part of it, and probably what's part of it is you're depressed. 

00:37:20
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:37:20
JUDITH BECK Now when you, this is a depression test. 

00:37:20
LATRICE Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
JUDITH BECK And all of these symptoms that you saw here are symptoms of depression. 

00:37:25
LATRICE Okay. 

00:37:25
JUDITH BECK So you're more pessimistic, you're more sad, you feel like a failure, you don't enjoy things as much. You feel guilty. You have trouble making decisions. You feel more confused, and those are all symptoms of the depression. And once you see the depression lifting you should see all of these symptoms getting somewhat better too. 

00:37:45
LATRICE Uh-huh. 

00:37:45
JUDITH BECK So that's just important for you to know . . . 

00:37:45
LATRICE Okay. 

00:37:45
JUDITH BECK That's its, that you have a real illness called depression, and no wonder you're having symptoms like this. 

00:37:55
LATRICE Okay. 

00:37:55
JUDITH BECK But let's get back to the situation where your mom was criticizing you for the paper towel. 

00:38:00
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:38:00
JUDITH BECK Now do you see that the reason that you were feeling sad and uh, scared was because what was going through your mind at the time. Now if you had a different kind of thought, then you might have felt a different kind of emotion. 

00:38:15
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:38:15
JUDITH BECK So if you had a, had, had a thought such as how dare mom talk to me like that . . . 

00:38:20
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:38:20
JUDITH BECK Then you might have felt angry. 

00:38:20
LATRICE Right. 

00:38:20
JUDITH BECK Or if you had a thought like, 'That's just mom blowing off steam, I don't have to pay too much attention to her.' 

00:38:30
LATRICE Right. 

00:38:30
JUDITH BECK Then you might have ended up feeling, feeling okay. 

00:38:35
LATRICE Uh-huh. 

00:38:35
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:38:35
LATRICE Right. 

00:38:35
JUDITH BECK So is that clear to you, how what you think in the situation affects then how you feel? 

00:38:40
LATRICE Yes. 

00:38:40
JUDITH BECK Okay. Now the other thing you need to know about depression is that everybody who's depressed has thoughts like this. They have depressing kind of thoughts. Frequently they have scared kinds of thoughts too. 

00:38:50
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:38:50
JUDITH BECK And that often times these thoughts are not true, or they're not completely true. 

00:39:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:00
JUDITH BECK But at the moment that you have the thoughts, um, usually you really think that they probably are completely true. You don't even think to say to yourself, 'Wait a minute, maybe this is just a depressed thought.' 

00:39:10
LATRICE Right. 

00:39:10
JUDITH BECK 'Maybe this isn't true.' 

00:39:10
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:10
JUDITH BECK So one of the things I'd like to do now is to teach you how you can figure out what your thoughts are . . . 

00:39:20
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:20
JUDITH BECK . . . and then how you can find out what degree they're true. 

00:39:25
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:25
JUDITH BECK If it turns out that your thoughts are true, then you need to solve a problem. 

00:39:30
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:30
JUDITH BECK There's a problem there to be solved. If the thoughts turn out to be not true . . . 

00:39:30
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:39:30
JUDITH BECK Then you change your thinking a but, around. 

00:39:35
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:35
JUDITH BECK And I'll teach you how to do that and when people change their thinking around then usually they start to feel better. 

00:39:40
LATRICE Okay. 

00:39:40
JUDITH BECK So, it seems to me one of the key thoughts is, um, what, oh, 'I might not make it. If I lose mom. I might not make it.' So I guess there's two things that we could do. The first question is, 'What's the likelihood that you will lose your mom?' 

00:40:00
LATRICE Uh, well, I I think that it is, she seems healthy at this point. At this stage in her life, but it's just that if things go like they usually, as parents usually die first. 

00:40:15
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:40:15
LATRICE And I know that is inevitable, but I don't know. 

00:40:25
JUDITH BECK When you have the thought, she's criticizing you about the paper towels, and you think, 'Oh no, what if I lose her?' Are you thinking what if I lose her 20-years from now, 30-years form now, or are you thinking, 'What if I lose her very soon?' 

00:40:40
LATRICE It was more if I lose her very soon. 

00:40:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Now do you have any evidence that you are going to lose her very soon? 

00:40:45
LATRICE No. 

00:40:45
JUDITH BECK Do you have any evidence on the other side, that you probably won't lose her very soon. 

00:40:55
LATRICE I don't know what very soon is. 

00:40:55
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

00:40:55
LATRICE I mean it, it's like, like saying in the years that come I hope and pray everyday that its, that I die before her sometimes. 

00:41:05
JUDITH BECK Well, another symptom of being very depressed. 

00:41:10
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:41:10
JUDITH BECK Is thinking a lot about death. What's the likelihood that she will die, say in the next five years? 

00:41:15
LATRICE Um, probably small. 

00:41:20
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:41:20
LATRICE Probably, uh, not, not very likely. 

00:41:25
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. And at the moment that she was yelling at you about the paper towels and you thought what if I lose her. Were you thinking, 'Oh there's only a very small chance that that would happen.' 

00:41:35
LATRICE I did, I did, toward the end after she blew me up . . . 

00:41:35
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:41:35
LATRICE Because she seems a lot stronger than me. 

00:41:40
JUDITH BECK Oh, I see. She seems pretty strong . . . 

00:41:40
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:41:40
JUDITH BECK When she was criticizing you. 

00:41:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:41:45
JUDITH BECK That's good that you were able then to let in the evidence of what was going on in front of your eyes. 

00:41:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:41:50
JUDITH BECK And when you though she, she seems pretty strong. 

00:41:50
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:41:50
JUDITH BECK Then, how did you feel emotionally? 

00:41:55
LATRICE Um . . . 

00:41:55
JUDITH BECK Did you feel a little bit better? 

00:42:00
LATRICE Somewhat. It was like it took a while. It took an hour or so for me to come to that. For me to kind of, to get the concept of that, but it finally dawned on me, but . . . 

00:42:10
JUDITH BECK Well that's wonderful. Do you see what you did, you did exactly what I'm trying to teach you to do. 

00:42:15
LATRICE Okay. 

00:42:15
JUDITH BECK Which is, you had a thought, 'Oh no, what if I lose her?' 

00:42:15
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:42:15
JUDITH BECK Uh, and in fact kind of the meaning to you was, 'I may lose her pretty soon.' 

00:42:25
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:42:25
JUDITH BECK And then you went away from the situation, you thought about it, and you realized that she was actually being very strong. And that, that was evidence against the fact that you were going to lose her. 

00:42:35
LATRICE Okay, yeah. 

00:42:35
JUDITH BECK And then you felt a little bit better. 

00:42:35
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:42:35
JUDITH BECK When you did that. 

00:42:40
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:42:40
JUDITH BECK So, and this is, this is exactly what I'm talking about, is taking the thoughts that go through your head, when you're feeling upset . . . 

00:42:50
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:42:50
JUDITH BECK . . .and looking at them more objectively. 

00:42:50
LATRICE Okay. 

00:42:55
JUDITH BECK Now I think another, sometime, and sometimes the thoughts are in word form, like, 'What if I lose my mother?' And sometimes they may be in images and pictures. A picture of yourself back in Chicago. 

00:43:05
LATRICE Right. 

00:43:05
JUDITH BECK So maybe we should talk about the Chicago picture for a minute. 

00:43:10
LATRICE Okay. 

00:43:10
JUDITH BECK So, you see yourself in Chicago, and so, at the particular house where you grew up. 

00:43:15
LATRICE Yes. In the area. 

00:43:15
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

00:43:15
LATRICE It's . . . 

00:43:15
JUDITH BECK And . . . 

00:43:15
LATRICE Yes, really, yes in that particular . . . 

00:43:20
JUDITH BECK In that house? 

00:43:20
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:43:20
JUDITH BECK And are you in particular room in that house? 

00:43:20
LATRICE Yeah, the room I grew up in. 

00:43:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. And what are you doing? 

00:43:25
LATRICE Um. 

00:43:25
JUDITH BECK When you see yourself in that room? 

00:43:30
LATRICE It's just, I wonder when I used to look out I could see downtown Chicago. And I'm just looking at that wonder. It seems like I spent so much time looking out that window making a, thinking about what I was going to do when I grow up and all that stuff, and . . . 

00:43:45
JUDITH BECK And here you see yourself back in that same room still looking out the window. 

00:43:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:43:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And what does that mean to you, being back in the room looking out the window again? 

00:43:55
LATRICE When I used to look out that window, I used to think about all the places that I wanted to see downtown. 

00:44:05
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:44:05
LATRICE And all the things that I really wanted to do, and what I wanted to be. It was just, when I think about it now, talking about it, it was kind of comforting. 

00:44:15
JUDITH BECK So it was optimistic when you were younger? 

00:44:20
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:44:20
JUDITH BECK Now when you have the image of being back in that same room, and you have the thought, 'I might not make it.' 

00:44:25
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:44:25
JUDITH BECK Then are you having the same kind of perspective? 

00:44:30
LATRICE It's . . . 

00:44:30
JUDITH BECK When you look out the window? 

00:44:30
LATRICE It's like um, when I'm looking out the window it's like, I don't know the room is empty. That's all I know. The room it's completely empty. The house is completely empty. And it's like the only thing that even bring light to the room is just the view out the window. 

00:44:55
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:44:55
LATRICE And so I don't really. . . 

00:45:00
JUDITH BECK Do I get the sense that it's as if the room is empty and your life is empty? 

00:45:05
LATRICE Someth-, I'm, may fee-, I may feel like that I think. That . . . 

00:45:05
JUDITH BECK Now am I putting words in your mouth? 

00:45:10
LATRICE No. 

00:45:10
JUDITH BECK You think that's right? 

00:45:10
LATRICE Yeah, I think that that um, that's one thing that always sticks out, that the house is just empty. It's empty. 

00:45:20
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. And you feel as if it would be a step back, if you went back to that room? 

00:45:30
LATRICE Yes. 

00:45:30
JUDITH BECK And why would that be a step back? 

00:45:30
LATRICE Because where I grew up wasn't the greatest place. 

00:45:35
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:45:35
LATRICE And I think that I don't know, just that view just gave me comfort, but I don't want to physically be there. 

00:45:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:45:50
LATRICE I don't want to every physically be there. 

00:45:50
JUDITH BECK So, when you're having these kind of thoughts that are in word form, then often times it's very helpful to respond to them in word form. As you did with the thought, 'What if I loose my mother?' 

00:46:00
LATRICE Oh. 

00:46:00
JUDITH BECK You thought more about it in words and you said to yourself, 'Well look how strong she is . . . 

00:46:05
LATRICE Right. 

00:46:05
JUDITH BECK . . . she just criticizing me, I'm not going to lose her soon . . . 

00:46:10
LATRICE Right. 

00:46:10
JUDITH BECK . . . the chances are.' If you're having the kind of thought that's in a picture form, then sometimes it's more helpful to try to change the picture, try to change the picture itself instead of only trying to change the words. 

00:46:20
LATRICE Okay. 

00:46:25
JUDITH BECK Um, now let's take the same picture where you're back in that room, and looking out at that room. Is there some way to figure out how to change the, that picture in your mind. So that actually you're feeling stronger? And feel as if you're moving ahead in life? 

00:46:40
LATRICE Put some furniture in . . . 

00:46:45
JUDITH BECK Put some furniture in, that's one thing . . . 

00:46:45
LATRICE Yeah, uh, yeah I think I could change the picture. Um. 

00:46:50
JUDITH BECK What kind of furniture would you put in that room? 

00:46:55
LATRICE Well sh-, the way I, we had a great apartment. I liked it. Uh, well for, uh, a nice couch, a bedroom, I mean a nice couch that we can fit . . . 

00:47:00
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:47:05
LATRICE Um, a bed. Pictures. 

00:47:05
JUDITH BECK And would you like to . . . 

00:47:05
LATRICE Family pictures. 

00:47:05
JUDITH BECK Would you like to imagine your kids jumping on the bed or something? 

00:47:10
LATRICE Yeah. Yeah, that . . . 

00:47:15
JUDITH BECK Having fun in the room? 

00:47:15
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:47:15
JUDITH BECK What do you see them doing? You know them, I don't know them. 

00:47:15
LATRICE They're jumping in the bed. 

00:47:20
JUDITH BECK Jumping on the bed. I guess I do know them. 

00:47:20
LATRICE That's what they would probably be doing, jumping on the bed. 

00:47:25
JUDITH BECK Okay, so now when you have this picture in your head . . . 

00:47:25
LATRICE (inaudible ) 

00:47:28
JUDITH BECK . . .and the room is furnished and it's got pictures on the wall. And there's a couch and a bed and you see that you got your three kids and they're jumping on the bed. How does that make you feel emotionally. 

00:47:35
LATRICE Better. 

00:47:40
JUDITH BECK Does it? 

00:47:40
LATRICE Yeah it does. 

00:47:40
JUDITH BECK Now the fact of the matter is that we don't know whether or not you're going to end up in that room again. 

00:47:45
LATRICE Right. 

00:47:45
JUDITH BECK My guess is somebody else probably lives there now. 

00:47:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:47:45
JUDITH BECK Is that right? 

00:47:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:47:50
JUDITH BECK So it's not likely. 

00:47:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:47:50
JUDITH BECK That you're going to end up in the room. 

00:47:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:47:50
JUDITH BECK So it's just something that you had a fantasy about. 

00:47:55
LATRICE Right. 

00:47:55
JUDITH BECK So what I'm suggesting is, since it's just a fantasy, it's not true anyway . . . 

00:48:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:48:00
JUDITH BECK Take that fantasy and improve it. 

00:48:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:48:00
JUDITH BECK In a way that makes you feel better. 

00:48:05
LATRICE Okay. Okay. 

00:48:05
JUDITH BECK And what do you think having pictures on the wall, and nice furniture, and kids on the bed, why does that make you feel better? What does it make you realize? 

00:48:15
LATRICE Because that's, I don't know, it just make me realize that the house is full. 

00:48:20
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

00:48:20
LATRICE I mean I grew up with a full house. Furniture, you know family, and everybody was just always there and . . . 

00:48:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:48:30
LATRICE . . . I think that just being in the room by myself growing up with eight other, older brothers and sisters is . . . 

00:48:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:48:40
LATRICE . . .it was just scary. 

00:48:40
JUDITH BECK No wonder you feel scared when you see that kind of image. So now every time you have that kind of image, see if you can say to yourself, 'Wait a minute, I'm going to improve on it.' 

00:48:45
LATRICE Okay. 

00:48:45
JUDITH BECK And then add things to the image. 

00:48:50
LATRICE Okay. 

00:48:50
JUDITH BECK But, maybe we ought to talk now about this stuff. The thought that you have and words that you might not make it. Especially if mom's not around, I might not make it. 

00:49:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:49:00
JUDITH BECK Now there's no doubt about it, say if you're mother died at some point in the next few years, that you would probably really feel at a loss. You'd be very grief stricken at first. You've had several losses already, and this would be another one on top of it. 

00:49:15
LATRICE Hm. 

00:49:15
JUDITH BECK She sounds very important to you. But I wonder if you could say that, um, although you would be extraordinarily be pained at first, that you would be able to continue on with your life. And that that grief might get a little bit less as time went on. Do you think that's possible? 

00:49:35
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:49:35
JUDITH BECK Is there something that makes you think that you might go down hill and stay down hill? 

00:49:40
LATRICE I don't know. 

00:49:45
JUDITH BECK Do you feel like you need your mom in order to make good decisions, or . . . 

00:49:45
LATRICE I feel like I need to gain independence from her before it happens. You know I . . . 

00:49:50
JUDITH BECK I see. 

00:49:50
LATRICE You know I, I want to be, I want to be independent before anything happens to her. I don't want it to force me to . . . 

00:50:00
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:50:00
LATRICE . . . I don't want anything to happen to her to force me into having to be responsible and having to be, you know, I don't want, I just don't want that to happen. 

00:50:10
JUDITH BECK I think it's a good plan. Now do you know what to do first in order to get more independent. Or the things that you've already done to try to get more independent? 

00:50:20
LATRICE Um, I'm, I'm trying to get more independent, but it's like, the hard part to me is having everybody telling me, 'Well you should do this first. You should do this first.' 

00:50:30
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:50:30
LATRICE And that is to me another burden, as far as everybody telling me to, 'You should do this and do this. You should do this this way.' And it's like trying to figure it out on my own, I don't have a clue now. 

00:50:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:50:40
LATRICE Because it's like I've put, have so much input from everybody else the way I should go, it's like everybody is saying take this road. And there's ten people telling me to take ten different roads. 

00:50:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:50:55
LATRICE And. 

00:50:55
JUDITH BECK Well maybe there is something I can teach you tonight that might be helpful to you. 

00:51:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:51:00
JUDITH BECK Can you tell me what a couple of those different roads might be? 

00:51:00
LATRICE Okay. Like my one sister called me and said that Latrice, you have to get a car first. And my other sister said, no Latrice, you have to get your place first. And my other sister said, if I was you I wouldn't move out of mom's house, because then you gonna never have any money for anything. 

00:51:20
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:51:20
LATRICE And I'm like, that's not what I want to do. 

00:51:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:51:25
LATRICE And my other sister, she was like, 'I think you should move out of state, so you can really know what independence is.' 

00:51:30
JUDITH BECK Right. And at this point you're feeling pretty confused. 

00:51:35
LATRICE Yes. 

00:51:35
JUDITH BECK Is there any one of these things that you think you could knock off. Say, 'No I don't think that's right for me right now.' 

00:51:45
LATRICE Um, moving out of state. 

00:51:45
JUDITH BECK Okay, so we can cross that one off right away. See, now you're only down to three. 

00:51:50
LATRICE Yeah. Okay. 

00:51:50
JUDITH BECK Okay. Car first or place first? A car first or a place first. Isn't that really the decision? 

00:51:55
LATRICE Right. 

00:51:55
JUDITH BECK Because 'Don't move,' goes along with car first. Is that right? 

00:52:00
LATRICE Um, yeah I guess it does. 

00:52:05
JUDITH BECK Um, maybe, maybe I'm missing something. 

00:52:05
LATRICE Um, no, I, what I think I should do is move first. 

00:52:10
JUDITH BECK Move first. 

00:52:15
LATRICE Yes. 

00:52:15
JUDITH BECK So do you feel comfortable in that decision, or not completely? 

00:52:15
LATRICE I feel confident in the decision when I share with everybody else. 

00:52:20
JUDITH BECK I'm sorry, can you say that again? 

00:52:25
LATRICE I feel confident in the decision of me wanting to move first when I share with every-, with my mother and my sisters and everybody. And then it's like all the pains come in. 

00:52:35
JUDITH BECK I see, right. And some people agree with you and some people don't agree with you. 

00:52:35
LATRICE Right. They agree that I should move, but they agree that I should get a car first and I don't think it's as important. Even thought they do, they think that . . . 

00:52:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:52:45
LATRICE I need to have a way to get around. But I think that I really need to have somewhere to like. 

00:52:50
JUDITH BECK To be. 

00:52:55
LATRICE Yes. 

00:52:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Yeah. Well it's certainly sounds sensible to me. Sometimes when you have to make a decision it's helpful to look at, what are the advantages of say moving first, and what would be the disadvantages of moving first. And then you can also look at what are the, um, advantages of getting a car first, and the disadvantages of getting a car first. And I think if you do that, you probably right about moving first, since you seem to feel it pretty strongly in your gut, but I think if you put it down on paper it may then help you to answer your family members who are saying, 'No you should do something different. 

00:53:35
LATRICE Okay, okay. 

00:53:35
JUDITH BECK Does that sound . . . 

00:53:35
LATRICE Yes. 

00:53:35
JUDITH BECK . . . sensible to you. 

00:53:35
LATRICE It does. 

00:53:35
JUDITH BECK What would be some of the advantages of moving first? 

00:53:45
LATRICE I have more time to study. 

00:53:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah, you know what, why don't we have you write some of this down. So you can remember them. 

00:53:50
LATRICE Okay. 

00:53:50
JUDITH BECK Here you go. So you just put a line down the middle of the page and put advantages. 

00:53:55
LATRICE Okay. 

00:53:55
JUDITH BECK On one side and disadvantages on the other side. And we'll just start this a little bit. 

00:54:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:54:00
JUDITH BECK Because I want to do some other things with you. So maybe you can finish this . . . 

00:54:05
LATRICE Okay 

00:54:05
JUDITH BECK . . .either on your own or with one of your sisters or with your mom. 

00:54:10
LATRICE Okay. 

00:54:10
JUDITH BECK Okay, so this is um, this is the advantages on disadvantages of moving first. 

00:54:15
LATRICE Okay. 

00:54:15
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:54:20
LATRICE Okay. 

00:54:20
JUDITH BECK And, you said one advantage would be to have more time to study. 

00:54:25
LATRICE Mm-hm. I'd have a lot more time to study. 

00:54:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And how about another advantage. 

00:54:30
LATRICE Um. I would be the only person, I would be the only adult I would be the person who has the foremost say to my children. 

00:54:40
JUDITH BECK Absolutely. So you better put that down. 

00:54:50
[sil.] 

00:54:55
LATRICE Okay. 

00:54:55
JUDITH BECK You know my sense is you're doing this so well, that you can probably continue to do this without me. 

00:55:00
LATRICE Okay. 

00:55:00
JUDITH BECK Do you think so, or would you rather continue and do it with me? 

00:55:05
LATRICE I, I, I, I think that, I, just talking about it is getting me to thinking. Um, I haven't thought of . . . 

00:55:10
JUDITH BECK That's good, I'm, I'm really impressed, I have to tell you, by the fact that you're depression score is 41, yet you seem to be very clear thinking about this. So somehow, you're able to over come the . . . 

00:55:20
LATRICE Be a (inaudible ). 

00:55:23
JUDITH BECK . . . depression to do this. 

00:55:23
LATRICE I think that that's what I really want to do. 

00:55:25
JUDITH BECK That's, that's what it sounds like to me too. 

00:55:25
LATRICE I think that, that it's like I'm just to the point where I think that I have to. 

00:55:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Okay, well it sounds very sensible to me. Okay, so one of the things that I'll have you do for homework, you didn't know that you were going to get homework tonight did you. 

00:55:40
LATRICE No. 

00:55:40
JUDITH BECK Is you're going to continue this list about advantages and disadvantages of moving. 

00:55:45
LATRICE Okay. 

00:55:45
JUDITH BECK And then if you'd like, you can also do advantages and disadvantages of getting a car first. 

00:55:50
LATRICE Okay. 

00:55:50
JUDITH BECK And then I think you'll feel stronger in being able to talk back to your sister. 

00:55:55
LATRICE Okay. 

00:55:55
JUDITH BECK Your sisters who are saying, 'No you have to get a car first. Save up your money, stay with mom longer.' 

00:56:00
LATRICE Yes. 

00:56:00
JUDITH BECK Okay. Now will you have trouble standing up for yourself? 

00:56:05
LATRICE Um, only to the extent that I feel as though I have been the one that has like um, my father was sick, I put in a lot of time with my parents, because um, I know that they getting older, they were getting older and stuff. And my mother, I have always been the one that if they need to get to appointments and everything . . . 

00:56:25
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:56:25
LATRICE I feel I make sure they, they did that. And whatever they needed done, if I can do it, then I'd try to do it. 

00:56:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:56:30
LATRICE And so, I didn't have a problem putting them first. But now I think that, they see, they know that if I move I'm not going to be there like I used to be. 

00:56:45
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:56:45
LATRICE And so . . . 

00:56:45
JUDITH BECK So maybe they have an interest in . . . 

00:56:50
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:56:50
JUDITH BECK . . . having you stay there. 

00:56:50
LATRICE Yeah, exactly. 

00:56:50
JUDITH BECK So another advantage to moving sooner is that you'll um, be able to put more energy toward you and your kids. Instead of toward your mom. 

00:57:00
LATRICE Yeah. 

00:57:00
JUDITH BECK Either you're mom will take up the slack or . . . 

00:57:05
LATRICE Right. 

00:57:05
JUDITH BECK Some of your brothers and sisters will take up the slack. 

00:57:05
LATRICE Exactly. 

00:57:05
JUDITH BECK Now . . . 

00:57:10
LATRICE That's true. 

00:57:10
JUDITH BECK . . . will you have trouble, you think, telling your sister who wants you to stay with your mom that you know that you've made a good decision? That you're going to move out? 

00:57:20
LATRICE Um. 

00:57:20
JUDITH BECK Is she hard to talk to? 

00:57:25
LATRICE No, she's not hard to talk to, she the oldest of us, all of the 11, and I think that she has had a lot of responsibility put on her . . . 

00:57:30
JUDITH BECK I see. 

00:57:30
LATRICE . . .and she has taken it very well. 

00:57:35
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:57:35
LATRICE And um, I think that she, she understands the advantage of moving. I think that she really does. 

00:57:40
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

00:57:40
LATRICE Um, you see my mother doesn't try, and so . . . 

00:57:45
JUDITH BECK I see. 

00:57:45
LATRICE I think that that plays a big part in it too. 

00:57:50
JUDITH BECK Right. 

00:57:50
LATRICE So um, but I don't think I'll have a problem talking to her. 

00:57:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. That's great. Then another homework assignment is to talk to your sisters who think that you shouldn't move. And just tell them in a nice, but a firm way that this is the decision that you've made. That you've really looked at all of the advantages and disadvantages. 

00:58:15
LATRICE Okay. 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:25
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

00:58:30
LATRICE Okay. 

00:58:30
JUDITH BECK Okay, but to get back to a related topic . . . 

00:58:35
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

00:58:35
JUDITH BECK It sounds as if you have a thought that kind of goes like this, 'If I lose mom before I become independent, then I might not make it.' 

00:58:50
LATRICE I do feel like that. 

00:58:50
JUDITH BECK Now I wonder if kind of another way of looking at it might be, 'If I become independent first, it will be easier on me if I lose mom.' Um, 'If I'm not independent first, it's going to be harder, but perhaps not necessarily impossible.' 

00:59:10
LATRICE That's true. 

00:59:10
JUDITH BECK You agree with that? 

00:59:15
LATRICE Yes. 

00:59:15
JUDITH BECK Is that something that you think would be helpful to remember? 

00:59:20
LATRICE Yes. 

00:59:20
JUDITH BECK Why don't we have you write down something about that. 

00:59:20
LATRICE Okay, then if I become independent first . . . 

00:59:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

00:59:30
[sil.] 

00:59:40
JUDITH BECK It'll be easier. 

00:59:40
LATRICE Okay, it will be easier. 

00:59:40
JUDITH BECK If I lose mom. 

00:59:45
[sil.] 

00:59:50
JUDITH BECK But if I'm not independent first . . . 

01:00:00
LATRICE Okay. 

01:00:00
JUDITH BECK . . . it will be harder, but not impossible. 

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:10
LATRICE Okay, 'but not impossible.' 

01:00:10
JUDITH BECK Now how much do you believe that last statement that you just wrote down, that it will be harder, but not impossible. 

01:00:15
LATRICE Um, I believe, I believe that if I'm an independent person it will be easier, if I'm not it will be harder, but not impossible. I believe it a lot. 

01:00:30
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Is there any part of you that doesn't believe it? 

01:00:35
LATRICE Um, I don't know. I believe, I, I want to believe this. I wanna, I really want to believe this. So I believe that I do believe it. I don't know though sometimes. 

01:00:55
JUDITH BECK You know, everybody needs help from time to time. And especially in the period when you're going to be grieving, I assume your sisters will be grieving as well. 

01:01:00
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:01:00
JUDITH BECK Do you think that you'll have your sisters for support? 

01:01:05
LATRICE Yes. 

01:01:05
JUDITH BECK And is there any, any, anyone among your sisters that might be able to help you in the way that your mom helps you now? 

01:01:15
LATRICE No. 

01:01:15
JUDITH BECK What kinds of things does your mom do for you now? 

01:01:15
LATRICE Um, babysit. 

01:01:20
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:01:20
LATRICE Um, , uh, supporti-, support . . . 

01:01:30
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:01:30
LATRICE Also the financial advantage is greater. 

01:01:35
JUDITH BECK There's no question about it. Anything else? 

01:01:40
LATRICE Um . . . 

01:01:45
[sil.] 

01:01:45
LATRICE . . .no that's really it. 

01:01:50
JUDITH BECK Well why don't we take just a minute to take a look at these three things to see whether it will be impossible to get these three things from other people. 

01:01:55
LATRICE Okay. 

01:01:55
JUDITH BECK Or will it just be harder? 

01:02:00
LATRICE Okay. 

01:02:00
JUDITH BECK Babysitting, what will you do about babysitting if you were to lose your mom? 

01:02:05
LATRICE I don't know. I would have to, I would have to find someobody to babysit them . . . 

01:02:10
JUDITH BECK You will have to find somebody. 

01:02:10
LATRICE I would have to find somebody. I would have to. 

01:02:15
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And you think that would be hard, but not impossible? 

01:02:20
LATRICE It probably would be hard, but not impossible. 

01:02:20
JUDITH BECK Okay. Who knows, you might even trade off some babysitting with . . . 

01:02:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:02:25
JUDITH BECK You know I'll watch your kids for a few hours, you watch mine. 

01:02:30
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:02:30
JUDITH BECK Okay, so how about emotional support? If your mom's not there to give it to you? Is it possible you could give it to yourself? 

01:02:45
LATRICE Coming from myself, um, I don't know at this, I used to feel confident that I could. 

01:02:50
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:02:50
LATRICE Um, I guess I could. 

01:02:55
JUDITH BECK It might be something you need to learn how to do again. You were once more confident in yourself, and you can get there again. Nobody that I know with a depression score of 41 feels confident, but it may be that once you're over the uh, depression . . . 

01:03:10
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:03:10
JUDITH BECK That you'll find that you r self confidence has come back and you will be able to support yourself better. 

01:03:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:03:20
JUDITH BECK How about the possibility of emotional support from any of your sisters? 

01:03:20
LATRICE They'll be there . . . 

01:03:20
JUDITH BECK They'll be there for you? 

01:03:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:03:25
JUDITH BECK So it's not quite as easy as getting emotional support from your mom, but there's always your sisters. 

01:03:35
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:03:35
JUDITH BECK And possibly your kids. Right? 

01:03:40
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:03:40
JUDITH BECK And financial support. Now you're getting help from your mom, and you're living in her place and stuff. So finances are going to be a problem if she's gone. Is that right? 

01:03:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:03:45
JUDITH BECK Now does it mean that you, it's impossible to get your financial resources together or just more difficult. 

01:03:55
LATRICE It will be more difficult, and I think that what I worry about is my kids, like now, we were out looking for a place, and they comparing everything to grandma's house. And I was like, 'It's not like her house.' And it was just a lot, just um . . . 

01:04:15
JUDITH BECK It must have been hard. 

01:04:15
LATRICE Yeah it was hard. 

01:04:15
JUDITH BECK Alright here's the hint for you. 

01:04:15
LATRICE . . . you know trying to . . . 

01:04:20
JUDITH BECK Before you go out and look for someplace new, you see it with your kids, we're going to do a little game. Let's see who can find the most good things about the next place we're going to look at. 

01:04:30
LATRICE Okay. Okay. 

01:04:30
JUDITH BECK And let's say who can say the fewest things about comparing it to grandma's place. 

01:04:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:04:35
JUDITH BECK Do you think they would like that? Do you think they could do that. How old are they again? 

01:04:40
LATRICE My oldest will be nine, they are nine, seven, and three. 

01:04:45
JUDITH BECK Well the three year old can't do it, but I bet the other two could do it. 

01:04:50
LATRICE Yeah, they could. 

01:04:50
JUDITH BECK So you kind of make it into a little game for them. Wanna write that one down too? 

01:04:55
LATRICE Sure. 

01:05:00
[sil.] 

01:05:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:05:15
JUDITH BECK Okay, so lets get back to this thought, 'If I don't have my independence first before I lose mom, I might not make it.' What's another way of looking at that now? 

01:05:30
LATRICE Um, offer some explan-, um, another way of looking at it, I guess if I had my independence now, I would feel a lot more secure. 

01:05:45
JUDITH BECK That's right, but not having your independence now, does that necessarily mean that you won't be able to make it? 

01:05:50
LATRICE It seems like if a, um, it, it seems that way. 

01:06:00
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:06:00
LATRICE Because, just because how things are now. 

01:06:05
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:06:05
LATRICE It really does seem that way, it almost seems like, 'If I don't make it out of here now, while,' it almost like I want to prove to her that I can make it. 

01:06:15
JUDITH BECK Well I think that it's a good idea to prove that. The only thing I'm trying to do now is to try to not be so anxious about it. 

01:06:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:06:20
JUDITH BECK And help you to see that even if the worst happened, and you were to lose her soon, it would be hard, but that you would eventually make it. 

01:06:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:06:35
JUDITH BECK You seem a little less sure of that then you did a few minutes ago. 

01:06:35
LATRICE Um, yeah, I want, I want that, I want it thought. 

01:06:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:06:40
LATRICE You know I really do. 

01:06:40
JUDITH BECK Well maybe important thing to remember is, I want independence so badly, that I'm making the steps toward it. And certainly going out and looking at apartments is very good. 

01:06:55
LATRICE Okay. 

01:06:55
JUDITH BECK And when we talked about it, first you said you were confused about what to do next, and then we talked about it for another minute, and then you were very clear about what to do next. 

01:07:05
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:07:05
JUDITH BECK So my sense is that you really are going in the right direction. 

01:07:05
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:05
JUDITH BECK You've got a good head on your shoulders, and you know what to do. . . 

01:07:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:10
JUDITH BECK And the depression is probably holding you back a little bit. 

01:07:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:10
JUDITH BECK And your fears may be holding you back a little bit too. 

01:07:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:15
JUDITH BECK But what I see is that you're plowing ahead, and you're looking at apartments, you're doing things to try to make your life better. 

01:07:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:20
JUDITH BECK What do you think that says about you as a person? 

01:07:30
LATRICE That I, that I'm trying . . . 

01:07:30
JUDITH BECK I wonder if you're stronger than you think you are. 

01:07:35
LATRICE I want, I don't know. I wonder. I want to be stronger. 

01:07:40
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:07:40
LATRICE I want to be stronger and independent. I, ah, and I feel so sad and burdened, but . . . 

01:07:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:07:40
LATRICE I really do. 

01:07:45
JUDITH BECK Well I think you're making some good steps toward it. The other thing that I was trying to get across tonight is that the reason you feel so sad and anxious sometimes are because of thoughts that you have. 

01:07:55
LATRICE Okay. 

01:07:55
JUDITH BECK So if you have thoughts like, 'What, if, um, if I lose mom before I get my independence I won't make it.' Those kind of thoughts are going to undermine you. 

01:08:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:10
JUDITH BECK And make you feel really anxious or sad. 

01:08:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:10
JUDITH BECK And you can't stop the thoughts from coming into your head, but once they come into your head you can say to yourself, 'Well wait a minute, how do I know that that's really true? Maybe it's not really true.' 

01:08:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:25
JUDITH BECK Maybe it's not as true as it feels right now. 

01:08:25
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:25
JUDITH BECK And let's see, you gave me an example before, about mom, oh, 'Even the thought I might lose mom,' and then you thought it over later and you said to yourself, 'Now wait a minute, here she was criticizing me she's actually very strong.' 

01:08:40
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:08:40
JUDITH BECK So that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about. 

01:08:40
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:40
JUDITH BECK Is when you are feeling really anxious or depressed, is to look for thoughts or pictures that are going through your head. 

01:08:50
LATRICE Okay. 

01:08:50
JUDITH BECK And then kind of evaluate them critically, and think to yourself, 'How true are they?' 

01:08:55
LATRICE Okay. Okay. How true are the thoughts? 

01:09:00
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:09:05
[sil.] 

01:09:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:09:15
JUDITH BECK Or if it's a picture going through your mind, then you can try to change the picture in the way that we did before. 

01:09:20
LATRICE Okay, change the picture. 

01:09:25
[sil.] 

01:09:30
JUDITH BECK Okay. So if you could summarize a little bit about what we talked about tonight, what do you think was important? 

01:09:35
LATRICE Um, standing firm on the decision that I need to move. 

01:09:35
JUDITH BECK Good. Very good. 

01:09:40
LATRICE Um, I don't know what else. 

01:09:45
JUDITH BECK You can look at your page. 

01:09:45
LATRICE Um, about, um, just the advantages also of moving. 

01:09:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:09:55
LATRICE And um, the thing to about becoming independent first, even be and . . . 

01:10:05
JUDITH BECK And what a good idea that is. 

01:10:05
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:10:05
JUDITH BECK But not to scare your- so much, yourself so much if that doesn't happen. 

01:10:10
LATRICE Yeah. Okay. 

01:10:15
JUDITH BECK Right? 

01:10:15
LATRICE Yes. 

01:10:15
JUDITH BECK And um, let's see, anything else we talked about tonight? Oh and then, and then, when you a do find that you're having some scary thoughts, or depressing kind of thoughts . . . 

01:10:25
LATRICE Mm-hm. Oh yeah. 

01:10:25
JUDITH BECK . . . just to say to yourself, 'How do I know that this is true?' 

01:10:25
LATRICE Right, how true are the thoughts. 

01:10:25
JUDITH BECK 'How true are these thoughts?' 

01:10:30
LATRICE Okay. 

01:10:30
JUDITH BECK Really. 

01:10:30
LATRICE And try to change the picture. 

01:10:35
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:10:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:10:35
JUDITH BECK Now, was there anything that I said tonight that you thought I misunderstood? 

01:10:40
LATRICE No. 

01:10:40
JUDITH BECK Uh, or anything that bothered you? 

01:10:45
LATRICE No. 

01:10:45
JUDITH BECK No? 

01:10:45
LATRICE No. 

01:10:45
JUDITH BECK Okay, and anything in particular in mind might have talked about? 

01:10:50
LATRICE Yes. About writing down the advantages and the disadvantages . . . 

01:10:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:10:55
LATRICE . . . about making a decision. 

01:10:55
JUDITH BECK And that will help you with other decisions as well. 

01:10:55
LATRICE Yeah, I, I, I see there that it is . . . 

01:11:00
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:11:00
LATRICE . . . it makes a lot of sense. 

01:11:00
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Is it, most of the time people just have these advantages and disadvantages swimming in their heads, but it's much easier if you put them down on paper. 

01:11:10
LATRICE Right. 

01:11:10
JUDITH BECK Then you can go and get a better idea. 

01:11:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:11:15
JUDITH BECK Good, well thanks for coming in tonight Ms. Latrice. 

01:11:15
LATRICE Oh, you're welcome. 

01:11:15
JUDITH BECK It's been a pleasure talking to you. 

01:11:15
LATRICE Thank you. 

01:11:20
[sil.] 

01:11:25
JON CARLSON Judith, is this a good example of cognitive therapy? 

01:11:25
JUDITH BECK I think in general it is. I think it shows the structure of the therapy session from doing a mood check, setting the agenda, specifying a problem to work on, teaching them patient tools, summarizing, getting feed back. So I think in that way it is. And I think in um, meeting the goals of a therapy session it is as well, and that is taking a problem and starting to do some problem solving toward it. 

01:11:50
Judith Beck, Ph.D. 

01:11:50
JON CARLSON Well if you had the opportunity to do this interview again, would you do anything differently? 

01:11:55
JUDITH BECK Well the one thing I'm curious about is whether she has a substance abuse problem, or did in the past. 

01:12:00
JON CARLSON Yeah, sure. 

01:12:00
JUDITH BECK And how that might relate to the depression, and to her ongoing problems. To be honest with you, because it was a cognitive therapy of depression tape, I shied away from even asking about it. 

01:12:10
JON CARLSON Okay. Where would you go next with her if you were going to meet with her again in a week or two? 

01:12:15
JUDITH BECK Well the first think I would do is to find out what problems she wants to work on next week. And then I'd also do some follow up from this session, and see whether she got the homework done, where is is in solving the problem of being more independent. 

01:12:25
JON CARLSON And would, would that be the eventual goal is to have her become more independent, or would it be to resolve the depression or just what's, where are you headed? 

01:12:35
JUDITH BECK Well, yeah, there really are several goals. One goal, the most obvious goal is to get the depression to remission. Also hope to teach her things during there, the course of therapy that she'll use not only in the coming weeks, but a year from now, five years from now, ten years from now, so relapse prevention is the second very important goal. 

01:12:55
Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D, ABPP 

01:12:55
JON CARLSON Okay. In this first clip we're going to watch, uh, you did a mood check with her, and you also used the back depression indicator, and came up with a score of 41. Can you talk about that. 

01:13:05
JUDITH BECK Well that score is in the severe range. And it's very helpful for me to know that her score is 41, and not 27. Something like that. 

01:13:10
JON CARLSON And the cutoff on that would be, what is it, 29, is that where the or 31 . . . 

01:13:20
JUDITH BECK Approximately. 

01:13:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:13:20
JUDITH BECK In that range in order to meet the criteria for severe depression. 

01:13:25
JON CARLSON So she did. 

01:13:25
JUDITH BECK So she really is quite depressed. And I can't really get that information without her filling out the scale, uh, unless I ask a great number of questions. So it very, the depression inventory allows me very quickly to see, what are her depression symptoms, it allows me from week to week, because I would give it to her every week to check whether some symptoms are getting better or worse. And for both of us to see whether the total score is coming down over time. So we have an objective check in addition to her subjective account of how she's feeling each week. 

01:14:00
JON CARLSON Well let's watch the mood check right now. 

01:14:05
LATRICE Okay. 

01:14:05
JUDITH BECK It was very helpful that you filled out this depression inventory, and you have a score of 41. 

01:14:05
LATRICE Uh-huh. 

01:14:05
JUDITH BECK Which usually indicates that the depression is in the severe range. 

01:14:10
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:14:10
JUDITH BECK How long have you been feeling like this? 

01:14:15
LATRICE Um, I, since December of 1996. 

01:14:15
JUDITH BECK Ah, what, what was going on then? 

01:14:20
LATRICE Um, I lost my brother. 

01:14:25
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:14:25
LATRICE And, I, um, was just starting to do a lot of erratic things. Things I thought were erratic. 

01:14:30
JUDITH BECK Such as? 

01:14:35
LATRICE Uh, I was arrested and . . . 

01:14:35
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

01:14:35
LATRICE . . . convicted, and . . . 

01:14:35
JUDITH BECK For, for what? 

01:14:40
LATRICE Delivery of controlled substances. 

01:14:45
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. 

01:14:45
LATRICE And it just changed my life a whole lot. 

01:14:50
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Do you, have you, so you got depressed then? 

01:14:55
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:14:55
JUDITH BECK And you've been depressed ever since? 

01:14:55
LATRICE I think so. 

01:14:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Now . . . 

01:14:55
JON CARLSON As we look at that example, was it hard for you not to query more about the fact she lost a brother, and she was convicted, and maybe has a substance abuse problem? 

01:15:10
JUDITH BECK Well, what I really wanted to do was go beyond that point, and to find out the whole scope of her problems. And then give her the choice of where we wanted to start. My sense was she looked a little embarrassed when she was talking about the drug problem. And I sensed in order to really build the relationship it was probably better not to go into it in depth at that point. In any case, my goal in the first part of the session is to hear the range of problems that the patient has, particularly in the first session and then help her choose which one to work on. 

01:15:45
JON CARLSON And that's what you do in this next segment. It sounds like we're just going to continue on, and what you do here is you set an agenda. 

01:15:50
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:15:50
JON CARLSON Let's watch that. 

01:15:55
JUDITH BECK Now, what I like to do at the beginning of session is to set an agenda . . . 

01:16:00
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:16:00
JUDITH BECK So that's what I want to do with you tonight. 

01:16:05
LATRICE Okay. 

01:16:05
JUDITH BECK And that's to reveal what problems you're having and then to pick one or maybe two of them to go over. 

01:16:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:16:10
JUDITH BECK So can you tell me a little bit about what's going on in your life now, what are some problems you might want to work on tonight? 

01:16:15
LATRICE Um, right now I think the biggest problem I'm having is, okay I work part time even though, I have two, three children like I said. And um, I was finally felt like I was really ready to get out on my own and raise them in my own household, and it has just been a struggle. Trying to find affordable housing for myself . . . 

01:16:35
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:16:35
LATRICE And, I think just coping everyday, by living with my mother, my father's been gone a year now. Over a year now. And, just the grief the ongoing grief is just comes and goes, and it's like you never know and . . . 

01:16:55
JUDITH BECK Your mom's grief or your grief? 

01:17:00
LATRICE Both of ours. 

01:17:00
JUDITH BECK Uh-huh. And grief over? 

01:17:00
LATRICE Over my father and brother's death. 

01:17:05
JUDITH BECK Okay. 

01:17:05
JON CARLSON It seems like you're working here at identifying a variety of different concerns that she has. 

01:17:10
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:17:10
JON CARLSON Are you usually so collaborative like that? 

01:17:15
JUDITH BECK Always. That's really the hallmark of cognitive therapy, is to be collaborative with the patient. And one way of being collaborative is to make sure that when they start talking at the beginning of the session, uh, that um, you don't just have the patient continue to talk about whatever he or she wants to talk about, but the therapist structures it, so that the patient sees clearly what are the choices in talking about various problems. And doesn't just talk about the first thing out of her mouth. 

01:17:45
DIANE KJOS And you really say, 'And this is what we're going to do now, and this is what we're going to do now.' 

01:17:50
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

01:17:50
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:17:50
DIANE KJOS So that she feels a sense of direction or security then with you. 

01:17:55
JUDITH BECK And what I try to say too is that, 'Okay, this is what I'd like to talk about next, is that okay?' 

01:18:00
DIANE KJOS And I noticed you taking notes. 

01:18:00
JUDITH BECK Right. And now I think that it's very important. What I'm trying to do is take notes in a way that I can remember the most important things to go over with her, without it interfering with our relationship with kind of the rapport that that we have. So I kind of trying and sneakily take some notes and then maintain eye contact. 

01:18:20
JON CARLSON In the next clip we're going to watch you take this list and get more and more specific . . . 

01:18:25
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:18:25
JON CARLSON And that's what, is that the protocol? 

01:18:25
JUDITH BECK Right. Patients usually come in with big problems like, 'My life is a mess,' or 'I'm very unhappy,' or 'I don't know what to do.' And then when you try to take these big problems and specify them, because those are too big to work on. So we try to, to narrow them down so that it's something that we can really talk about, and start to solve in the, in that session. 

01:18:45
JON CARLSON Well let's watch you specify the problem. 

01:18:45
LATRICE Um, uh, I just, I think that I, I'm just wishing that it's better. 

01:18:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:18:55
LATRICE Hoping that it get's better at some point. 

01:18:55
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. And when you say wishing it would get better, what's the if? 

01:19:00
LATRICE Just uh, feeling so burdened by so many thing. 

01:19:10
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Well what kinds of things? 

01:19:15
LATRICE Um, well, being a parent is tough. 

01:19:20
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:19:20
LATRICE Being a mom is tough. 

01:19:20
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. That's true. 

01:19:20
LATRICE So I feel that sort of burden and then feeling that I , I, I feel like I do have an obligation to my mother . . . 

01:19:25
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:19:25
LATRICE . . .she's moving into her senior years. Senior citizen years. And I come from a large family. And I just feel kind of burdened to meet expectations. What is expected of me, and . . . 

01:19:50
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:19:50
LATRICE Sometimes it's not easy. 

01:19:50
JUDITH BECK And these expectations are what kinds of things? 

01:19:55
JON CARLSON You really zeroed in on the problem here. 

01:19:55
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:19:55
JON CARLSON I like the way you clarified the if for her. 

01:20:00
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:20:00
JON CARLSON It seemed like that was really meaningful. 

01:20:00
JUDITH BECK I think patients first come to therapy, they don't necessarily have the skill of being able to specify their problems. They just feel very overwhelmed frequently by their emotions. And as you said before they're both the structure and the narrowing down of the problems I think gives them a sense of control. 'Gee, maybe there's something I can do about these problems. 

01:20:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Picking it apart. 

01:20:20
JON CARLSON And the word choice was very important. That you got her to focus, 'it' now . . . 

01:20:30
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:20:30
JON CARLSON became a whole sentence for what exactly 'it' was. 

01:20:30
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:20:35
JON CARLSON In the next piece we're going to have you look at some more of the problem list than have, uh, her look specifically and go over the problem list and to choose what she wants to work on, follows that collaborative theme . . . 

01:20:45
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON . . . and that's what you're attempting to do for sure. 

01:20:50
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:20:50
JON CARLSON Let's watch it. 

01:20:55
JUDITH BECK Okay. Well let me go through the problems that you mentioned. And then we'll maybe we can pick one out to start working on. 

01:21:00
LATRICE Okay. 

01:21:00
JUDITH BECK So the first thing is the housing problem. And I'm not sure I have much to offer you on that, but just maybe more of a practical thing. 

01:21:05
LATRICE Right. Right. 

01:21:05
JUDITH BECK Second thing is coping better with your mother. And especially when you get to a spiral where you're mother's feeling a lot of grief and then you start to feel unsure and scared. So that's one thing that we can talk about. Then another thing we could talk about is feeling burdened by your role as a parent. 

01:21:25
LATRICE Okay. 

01:21:25
JUDITH BECK And then the third thing we could talk about is feeling obligated to your mom. 

01:21:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:21:35
JUDITH BECK And I guess there's a fourth thing is meeting families expectations for finishing college and so forth. 

01:21:40
LATRICE Right. 

01:21:40
JUDITH BECK It sounds as if maybe your comparing yourself to some of your other brothers and sisters. 

01:21:45
LATRICE Well, I do, because you hear it a lot. I hear it a lot about me still being at home with my mother. I get the comparisons a lot. 

01:21:55
JUDITH BECK Right. So which one of those would you like to talk about tonight? 

01:22:00
LATRICE Um, I think the dealing with the grief with my mom and it. 

01:22:00
JUDITH BECK Okay, now did this kind of situation come . . . 

01:22:05
JON CARLSON There's no doubt who the therapist is. You really take an active role. 

01:22:10
JUDITH BECK Right. Well she's a very depressed patient, and she doesn't know how she's going to get better. By listening to her problems and conceptualizing what's going on. I have a sense of what direction we need to go. Now I never know in advance whether or not any particular intervention is going to work or not, but at least I have a game plan in my mind. 

01:22:30
DIANE KJOS I almost, as I'm watching that this time, and the feeling that there's almost like she was feeling like these were just piling on her shoulders. 

01:22:35
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:22:35
DIANE KJOS And then when you asked her to pick one, there was a bit of a sigh that said, oh, you know it's like, okay. 

01:22:40
JUDITH BECK So just listing the problems itself did seem to make her feel somewhat overwhelmed. 

01:22:50
DIANE KJOS Yes. 

01:22:50
JUDITH BECK But then honing in and working on one specific one made her a little bit more more hopeful. 

01:22:50
DIANE KJOS Hopeful. That was my sense. Yeah. 

01:22:55
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:22:55
JON CARLSON Um in the next piece we're going to watch you're going to focus on the loss of her mom or this loss thing in her life. Which might actually be core beliefs. Um, her core beliefs. 

01:23:05
JUDITH BECK I think tied to a core belief. 

01:23:10
JON CARLSON Yeah. What would you think the core belief might be for her? 

01:23:15
JUDITH BECK Well, it's interesting that, the, to her losing her mom um, means losing uh, uh sense of support. Financial support, emotional support, help with making decisions and so forth. And it seems to me that underneath it all, she really believes that she's at least to some degree helpless and inadequate. 

01:23:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:23:30
JUDITH BECK And that she really needs her mom to, to make it. Maybe even to survive. 

01:23:35
JON CARLSON And you're going to follow this up in this segment by trying to get some of the automatic thoughts that come up. 

01:23:45
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:23:45
JON CARLSON Can, can you let our viewers know just what to look for here specifically that you're going to be doing? 

01:23:50
JUDITH BECK What I'm trying to find out from her is, in the specific situation that came up this week, what were the thoughts that went through her mind at the time. And these are thoughts that are directly connected with her dysphoric feelings. She has two sets of thoughts, on are kind of sad thoughts, and the other ones are anxious thoughts. So I'm going to try to elicite both kinds, and then make a decision about which thought seems to me be the most important one to go after. 

01:24:15
JON CARLSON Okay, let's watch. 

01:24:20
JUDITH BECK What thoughts do you think were connected with feeling scared and unsure? 

01:24:25
LATRICE I thought that, just seeing her, just seeing she seems so different now. She just, she seemed real, real sure patient now, and what made me scared is just the thought of losing her and just the thought of if I was wondering, 'Okay, if I, if my dad l-, when my dad died I lost, I feel like I lost a lot of things. I don't know.' 

01:25:00
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:25:00
LATRICE Seems like things just started to go away, I don't, and with her I feel, I was just scared that I don't know, I'm, I'm just in a, I just feel scared. 

01:25:15
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:25:15
LATRICE I feel like that I might loose her, and it scares me a lot. 

01:25:20
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And what's your thought, 'If I loose her, then what' What's the word . . . 

01:25:20
LATRICE That if I lose her . . . 

01:25:25
JUDITH BECK What are you afraid would happen? 

01:25:25
LATRICE I won't have anybody in my, on my side. 

01:25:30
JUDITH BECK If I lose her I won't have anybody on my side and then, what are you afraid will happen then? 

01:25:35
LATRICE I'm afraid that I don't know what I'm going to do. That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know. I don't know what would happen to me if I make it. That's what . . . 

01:25:45
JUDITH BECK So you have the thought, 'I might not make it.' 

01:25:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:25:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. And do you have an image or a picture in your head of not making it? 

01:25:50
JON CARLSON She seems to be very comfortable with your questions. She didn't seem to have any trouble coming up with the thoughts once you asked the right questions. Is this typical? 

01:26:00
JUDITH BECK Well there's really a range in therapy. Some patients are like this where all you have to do is to as for the thoughts or ask the question what's going through your mind and they're easily able to come up with their automatic thoughts. Other patients at the other extreme are much more difficult. There are patients who say 'I don't know.' Or who keep on telling you their emotions, but have more difficulty illicing their thoughts from them. 

01:26:25
DIANE KJOS Now her thoughts, as she, as she talked about them there's a great deal of emotional undertow there . . . 

01:26:30
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

01:26:30
DIANE KJOS . . .at one point I thought she was just on the edge of tears. 

01:26:35
JUDITH BECK I think so too. 

01:26:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:26:35
JUDITH BECK So it, what that shows me is that that's probably a very important thought to go after in therapy. Now she may have had thousands of thoughts during the week. Thousands of negative dysfunctional thoughts. But there's only time to go into on or two or maybe three in a therapy session. So I'm looking for thoughts that are um, produce a lot of emotion. A lot of negative emotion. That are clearly distorted in some way. That seem very typical that come up often in the past, may come up often in the future. Uh, and uh . . . 

01:27:05
DIANE KJOS So that, that emotional tone then gives you a hint of where you want to go. 

01:27:10
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

01:27:10
JON CARLSON For it, actually more than a hint. 

01:27:15
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:27:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:27:15
JON CARLSON You finished the segment talking about an image and we're going to jump ahead to where you actually get her to change an image. 

01:27:20
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:27:20
JON CARLSON Is, is doing this kind of work with imaging and important part of cognitive therapy. 

01:27:30
JUDITH BECK I think it should be an important part of cognitive therapy. I think even a lot of cognitive therapists neglect this one area though. They just assume that patients thoughts are always in verbal form, and they don't even know to look for images that are, thoughts that are in the form of images. But um, the images can be quite powerful, and really lead to a lot of negative emotion. So it's important to have patients uncover them if indeed they're there. 

01:27:50
JON CARLSON Do you ever go further with this and get somebody to relax deeply, and maybe even use some hypnosis techniques to help elicite these images. 

01:28:00
JUDITH BECK There's some therapists that use some hypnotic techniques. I think it's probably better not to do that unless you absolutely have to, because if you're using hypnosis it's putting more of the control in the therapist's instead of in the patient's seat. 

01:28:15
JON CARLSON Oh sure. 

01:28:15
JUDITH BECK And we found that, really patients are pretty much able to recall important memories and thoughts without the use of hypnosis. We do use uh, imagery, experiential kinds of techniques particularly with personality disorder patients. When we're looking at how some of their beliefs originated in childhood trauma. And we get patients to re-experience that trauma and that uh, try to restructure the meaning of some of these experiences though guided imagery. 

01:28:40
DIANE KJOS Hm. 

01:28:40
JON CARLSON In this clip you're actually going to change an image, can you help our viewers know just what to look for? 

01:28:50
JUDITH BECK Well, the uh, the part right before here, and so I've elicited an image that seemed to occur to her over and over again. And this is where she's alone in the room where she grew up, and the room is completely empty. And this spontaneous image comes to mind quite a lot for her and causes her quite a lot of distress. Now it's not anything that ever, uh, that has happened to her, or is likely to happen, but when the image occurs to her it still makes her feel very upset. So just teaching her one technique of kind of taking control of that image and changing it, so that she doesn't feel so upset. 

01:29:30
JON CARLSON Take kind of a useless image and making it into a more useful one, or at least a neutral one. 

01:29:35
JUDITH BECK Right, exactly. 

01:29:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:29:35
JUDITH BECK Kind of undercut the impact of it. 

01:29:35
JON CARLSON Well, let's watch it. 

01:29:40
JUDITH BECK . . . the chances are.' If you're having the kind of thought that's in a picture form, then sometimes it's more helpful to try to change the picture, try to change the picture itself instead of only trying to change the words. 

01:29:50
LATRICE Okay. 

01:29:55
JUDITH BECK Um, now let's take the same picture where you're back in that room, and looking out at that room. Is there some way to figure out how to change the, that picture in your mind. So that actually you're feeling stronger? And feel as if you're moving ahead in life? 

01:30:10
LATRICE Put some furniture in . . . 

01:30:15
JUDITH BECK Put some furniture in, that's one thing . . . 

01:30:15
LATRICE Yeah, uh, yeah I think I could change the picture. Um. 

01:30:20
JUDITH BECK What kind of furniture would you put in that room? 

01:30:25
LATRICE Well sh-, the way I, we had a great apartment. I liked it. Uh, well for, uh, a nice couch, a bedroom, I mean a nice couch that we can fit . . . 

01:30:30
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:30:35
LATRICE Um, a bed. Pictures. 

01:30:35
JUDITH BECK And would you like to . . . 

01:30:35
LATRICE Family pictures. 

01:30:35
JUDITH BECK Would you like to imagine your kids jumping on the bed or something? 

01:30:40
LATRICE Yeah. Yeah, that . . . 

01:30:45
JUDITH BECK Having fun in the room? 

01:30:45
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:30:45
JUDITH BECK What do you see them doing? You know them, I don't know them. 

01:30:45
LATRICE They're jumping in the bed. 

01:30:50
JUDITH BECK Jumping on the bed. I guess I do know them. 

01:30:50
LATRICE That's what they would probably be doing, jumping on the bed. 

01:30:55
JUDITH BECK Okay, so now when you have this picture in your head . . . 

01:30:55
LATRICE (inaudible ) 

01:31:00
JUDITH BECK . . .and the room is furnished and it's got pictures on the wall. And there's a couch and a bed and you see that you got your three kids and they're jumping on the bed. How does that make you feel emotionally. 

01:31:10
LATRICE Better. 

01:31:15
JUDITH BECK Does it? 

01:31:15
LATRICE Yeah it does. 

01:31:15
JUDITH BECK Now the fact of the matter is that we don't know whether or not you're going to end up in that room again. 

01:31:20
LATRICE Right. 

01:31:20
JUDITH BECK My guess is somebody else probably lives there now. 

01:31:20
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:31:20
JUDITH BECK Is that right? 

01:31:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:31:25
JUDITH BECK So it's not likely. 

01:31:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:31:25
JUDITH BECK That you're going to end up in the room. 

01:31:25
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:31:25
JUDITH BECK So it's just something that you had a fantasy about. 

01:31:30
LATRICE Right. 

01:31:30
JUDITH BECK So what I'm suggesting is, since it's just a fantasy, it's not true anyway . . . 

01:31:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:31:35
JUDITH BECK Take that fantasy and improve it. 

01:31:35
LATRICE Okay. 

01:31:35
JUDITH BECK In a way that makes you feel better. 

01:31:40
JON CARLSON Not only did you seem to change the image for her, but she seemed to enjoy the work. 

01:31:40
JUDITH BECK She did, you really could see a change in her affect, as she went to a lonely room to what would probably be a more realistic picture anyway. In whatever apartment she moves to she will have furniture, she will have kids jumping around. It will not be empty. 

01:31:50
Judith Beck, Ph.D. 

01:31:50
JON CARLSON Yeah. And she seemed that at, at least more alive. Less depressed. More empowered. 

01:32:00
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:32:00
DIANE KJOS This is interesting, because the first part of the image was really this abandoned person in this empty place, and all of a sudden now she's got this fun kind of piece to it. 

01:32:10
JUDITH BECK That's right. And in fact what we did was really changed it to a more realistic image. She probably will not be alone in her room as long as she has three kids. 

01:32:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah, that's true. 

01:32:15
JON CARLSON In the next piece you begin, or at least prior to beginning she's talking about wanting to be independent, and then she's soliciting this advice from all of her sisters about how to be independent. 

01:32:30
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:32:30
JON CARLSON So she does things in this very dependent way. 

01:32:35
JUDITH BECK She does. What I'm trying to do is first of all to find out from her um, what is, what particularly is the decision that she has to make. What kinds of advice has she gotten. And then actually to my surprise it turns out she's already made the decision. And what I tried to do is just support that since it seemed to be a reasonable choice. And uh, to reinforce in her the idea that she's made this decision already, and then we look at advantages and disadvantages of that, of the decision itself. So that she can learn a technique to use in the future when she needs to make decisions, but also so that she can learn to stand up for herself with her very well meaning well intentioned sisters, who are kind of undermining this sense of independence. 

01:33:20
JON CARLSON I think that is important for our viewers to look at, because rather than fitting in with the sisters and also offering advice for her. You brought it out from her, to let her know that she can make her own decisions. That she did, that the solution was already within her. 

01:33:30
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

01:33:30
JON CARLSON Let's watch how you did that. 

01:33:35
JUDITH BECK . . .maybe we ought to talk now about this stuff. The thought that you have and words that you might not make it. Especially if mom's not around, I might not make it. 

01:33:45
LATRICE Okay. 

01:33:45
JUDITH BECK Now there's no doubt about it, say if you're mother died at some point in the next few years, that you would probably really feel at a loss. You'd be very grief stricken at first. You've had several losses already, and this would be another one on top of it. 

01:34:00
LATRICE Hm. 

01:34:00
JUDITH BECK She sounds very important to you. But I wonder if you could say that, um, although you would be extraordinarily be pained at first, that you would be able to continue on with your life. And that that grief might get a little bit less as time went on. Do you think that's possible? 

01:34:20
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:34:20
JUDITH BECK Is there something that makes you think that you might go down hill and stay down hill? 

01:34:25
LATRICE I don't know. 

01:34:30
JUDITH BECK Do you feel like you need your mom in order to make good decisions, or . . . 

01:34:30
LATRICE I feel like I need to gain independence from her before it happens. You know I . . . 

01:34:35
JUDITH BECK I see. 

01:34:35
LATRICE You know I, I want to be, I want to be independent before anything happens to her. I don't want it to force me to . . . 

01:34:45
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

01:34:45
LATRICE . . . I don't want anything to happen to her to force me into having to be responsible and having to be, you know, I don't want, I just don't want that to happen. 

01:34:55
JUDITH BECK I think it's a good plan. Now do you know what to do first in order to get more independent. Or the things that you've already done to try to get more independent? 

01:35:05
LATRICE Um, I'm, I'm trying to get more independent, but it's like, the hard part to me is having everybody telling me, 'Well you should do this first. You should do this first.' 

01:35:15
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:35:15
LATRICE And that is to me another burden, as far as everybody telling me to, 'You should do this and do this. You should do this this way.' And it's like trying to figure it out on my own, I don't have a clue now. 

01:35:25
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:35:25
LATRICE Because it's like I've put, have so much input from everybody else the way I should go, it's like everybody is saying take this road. And there's ten people telling me to take ten different roads. 

01:35:40
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:35:40
LATRICE And. 

01:35:40
JUDITH BECK Well maybe there is something I can teach you tonight that might be helpful to you. 

01:35:45
LATRICE Okay. 

01:35:45
JUDITH BECK Can you tell me what a couple of those different roads might be? 

01:35:45
LATRICE Okay. Like my one sister called me and said that Latrice, you have to get a car first. And my other sister said, no Latrice, you have to get your place first. And my other sister said, if I was you I wouldn't move out of mom's house, because then you gonna never have any money for anything. 

01:36:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:36:05
LATRICE And I'm like, that's not what I want to do. 

01:36:10
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:36:10
LATRICE And my other sister, she was like, 'I think you should move out of state, so you can really know what independence is.' 

01:36:15
JUDITH BECK Right. And at this point you're feeling pretty confused. 

01:36:25
LATRICE Yes. 

01:36:25
JUDITH BECK Is there any one of these things that you think you could knock off. Say, 'No I don't think that's right for me right now.' 

01:36:35
LATRICE Um, moving out of state. 

01:36:35
JUDITH BECK Okay, so we can cross that one off right away. See, now you're only down to three. 

01:36:40
LATRICE Yeah. Okay. 

01:36:40
JUDITH BECK Okay. Car first or place first? A car first or a place first. Isn't that really the decision? 

01:36:45
LATRICE Right. 

01:36:45
JUDITH BECK Because Don't move,' goes along with car first. Is that right? 

01:36:50
LATRICE Um, yeah I guess it does. 

01:36:55
JUDITH BECK Um, maybe, maybe I'm missing something. 

01:36:55
LATRICE Um, no, I, what I think I should do is move first. 

01:37:00
JUDITH BECK Move first. 

01:37:05
LATRICE Yes. 

01:37:05
JON CARLSON Now the dependent client or somebody with these dependent traits like she has, how do you keep from providing what she wants? Telling her what to do? And . . . 

01:37:10
JUDITH BECK Well I think in some cases it is important to give her some advice, and to make suggestions for her. But as much as possible, if she has the skills to do it herself, uh, and I have some data to think that she is going to be successful in that, then I'll always try that first. Because again my conceptualization is that underneath she feels very helpless and inadequate. And I'm very conscious during this session of providing as many opportunities as possible to undercut that belief. 

01:37:40
JON CARLSON What about you're a powerful therapist and she's an oppressed client, and uh, how do you stop the, her from giving you superficial kinds of feedback. 

01:37:50
JUDITH BECK Agreement. 

01:37:50
JON CARLSON Agreement. Yeah, just saying what you want to hear? 

01:37:55
JUDITH BECK Well I think you put your finger on something very important, and I think she is uh, an overly compliant patient, and we also see that in dependent kind of patients. And there were several times during this session when I did feel as if she was superficially agreeing. And so then I would ask questions such as, um, 'Is there part of you that doesn't believe that.' Or, 'If you were, um, what would it mean not to make it?' 

01:38:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, well this next clip uh, I thought that's what was going on, and oyu picked up on it and had her do some writing. 

01:38:25
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:38:25
JON CARLSON Had her, is that an important part of tying into therapy. To get people to write? 

01:38:30
JUDITH BECK We do try to get people to write, patients to write. If they can't write, then we write for them. Or we might have them put an audio tape for the last couple of minutes of the session to summarize the most important points. But research has shown that patients forget almost everything that happens in the doctor's office. So a good rule of thumb is anything that you want a patient to remember really needs to be recorded in some way. Now sometimes we have patients just write down something toward the end of the session. Not necessarily throughout a session. Uh, but there are other times, especially with the very dependent patient, where it is very useful to have them write throughout a session. Uh, as you have concluded talking about something important. Because then it gives them the opportunity to kind of take control and to write down something for themselves. It's giving them message. 

01:39:15
DIANE KJOS It seems to me in her, in her case it also gives her a weapon in a sense. Or some armor to use with those sisters. 

01:39:25
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

01:39:25
DIANE KJOS You know, 'Went to this therapist, she told me,' or 'This is what I came up with.' 

01:39:30
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:39:30
DIANE KJOS It would be at least two. 

01:39:30
JUDITH BECK She um, my sense was that she had ten people telling her what to do. . . 

01:39:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:39:35
JUDITH BECK . . . and I, so what was going through my mind is, 'How can I make a difference for her outside of this session.' 

01:39:45
DIANE KJOS Well at one point she in the, in the tape I don't know that we sh- that we show it during this p-, time, but she actually says she has ten different opinions. 

01:39:55
JUDITH BECK That's right. 

01:39:55
JON CARLSON And you could count . . . 

01:39:55
JUDITH BECK And my sense was that if I didn't have her write something down that she would be quickly swamped the . . . 

01:40:00
JON CARLSON With those ten different opinions. 

01:40:00
JUDITH BECK . . .the moment she left the session. 

01:40:00
JON CARLSON And she would forget about it. Maybe that's why our minister now is having us take notes, because he's really serious now. Wants us to remember things. 

01:40:10
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:40:10
JON CARLSON Let's watch how you do this with the client. 

01:40:10
JUDITH BECK . . .get back to a related topic . . . 

01:40:15
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:40:15
JUDITH BECK It sounds as if you have a thought that kind of goes like this, 'If I lose mom before I become independent, then I might no t make it.' 

01:40:30
LATRICE I do feel like that. 

01:40:30
JUDITH BECK Now I wonder if kind of another way of looking at it might be, 'If I become independent first, it will be easier on me if I lose mom.' Um, 'If I'm not independent first, it's going to be harder, but perhaps not necessarily impossible.' 

01:40:50
LATRICE That's true. 

01:40:50
JUDITH BECK You agree with that? 

01:40:55
LATRICE Yes. 

01:40:55
JUDITH BECK Is that something that you think would be helpful to remember? 

01:41:00
LATRICE Yes. 

01:41:00
JUDITH BECK Why don't we have you write down something about that. 

01:41:00
LATRICE Okay, then if I become independent first . . . 

01:41:05
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:41:10
[sil.] 

01:41:20
JUDITH BECK It'll be easier. 

01:41:20
LATRICE Okay, it will be easier. 

01:41:20
JUDITH BECK If I lose mom. 

01:41:25
[sil.] 

01:41:30
JUDITH BECK But if I'm not independent first . . . 

01:41:30
LATRICE Okay. 

01:41:30
JUDITH BECK . . . it will be harder, but not impossible. 

01:41:35
[sil.] 

01:41:40
LATRICE Okay, 'but not impossible.' 

01:41:40
JUDITH BECK Now how much do you believe that last statement that you just wrote down, that it will be harder, but not impossible. 

01:41:45
LATRICE Um, I believe, I believe that if I'm an independent person it will be easier, if I'm not it will be harder, but not impossible. I believe it a lot. 

01:42:10
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. Is there any part of you that doesn't believe it? 

01:42:15
LATRICE Um, I don't know. I believe, I, I want to believe this. I wanna, I really want to believe this. So I believe that I do believe it. I don't know though sometimes. 

01:42:35
JUDITH BECK You know, everybody needs help from time to time. And especially in the period when you're going to be grieving, I assume your sisters will be grieving as well. 

01:42:40
LATRICE Mm-hm. 

01:42:40
JUDITH BECK Do you think that you'll have your sisters for support? 

01:42:45
LATRICE Yes. 

01:42:45
JUDITH BECK And is there any, any, anyone among your sisters that might be able to help you in the way that your mom helps you now? 

01:42:55
LATRICE No. 

01:42:55
JUDITH BECK What kinds of things does your mom do for you now? 

01:42:55
LATRICE Um, babysit. 

01:43:00
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:43:00
LATRICE Um, , uh, supporti-, support . . . 

01:43:10
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:43:10
LATRICE Also the financial advantage is greater. 

01:43:15
JUDITH BECK There's no question about it. Anything else? 

01:43:25
LATRICE Um . . . 

01:43:30
[sil.] 

01:43:30
LATRICE . . .no that's really it. 

01:43:35
JUDITH BECK Well why don't we take just a minute to take a look at these three things to see whether it will be impossible to get these three things from other people. 

01:43:40
JON CARLSON I really appreciated your continued solicitation and use of not just her verbal, but her non verbal ques. 

01:43:45
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:43:45
JON CARLSON And the way that you were able to keep probing whether or not this was a yes ma'am response or if it was something that was more deeply felt. 

01:43:55
JUDITH BECK Yes, and there were two things. One is I watched for her, her uh face whether that was changing . . . 

01:44:05
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

01:44:05
JUDITH BECK . . . her body posture and so forth. And I was also thinking to myself, if I had had a really strong belief the way that she does, would I change my belief so quickly, and the answer was not. And so that was another cue to me to probe deep-, more deeply and make sure that she really understood what we were talking about. 

01:44:20
Judith Beck, Ph.D. 

01:44:25
JON CARLSON I continue to be impressed with the way you solicit, and you use verbal as well as the nonverbal feedback that you're getting from her. Um, is that a hallmark of cognitive therapists, to really to interpret this nonverbal behavior? 

01:44:40
Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. ABPP 

01:44:40
JUDITH BECK Oh yes, it's very important. Um, with this particular patient I have the sense from her nonverbal cues that she's really agreeing with me superficially. But that it really hasn't made any cognitive shift kind of in her gut. And I keep on thinking to myself, if I had thoughts as she did, would I be able to change my mind so quickly. And when my answer was no, then I used that plus the nonverbal cues uh, as a cue to myself to go deeper. 

01:45:10
JON CARLSON Well when you did with her and you actually had her think about what she said, and she took her time, and paused and thought about it, uh, she actually did agree with it, but I think that was really the first time that she had thought about it. 

01:45:20
JUDITH BECK Yes, she really had to let it sink down more in order to um, think more deeply about it and make this cognitive shift. 

01:45:30
DIANE KJOS She's, its helpful that she's, she's has such wonderful expressions that you can pick up a great deal from her, watching her face. It's a . . . 

01:45:35
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

01:45:35
JUDITH BECK She does, and she's an easier client in that way. The more difficult clients are the ones who have more of a mask, and who don't really let you know how they're feeling right at the moment. And it's very important to be able to figure out whether the patient is having interfering automatic thoughts during the therapy session itself. 

01:45:55
DIANE KJOS Mm-hm. 

01:45:55
JON CARLSON In this next segment you're moving towards a closing piece. And as you do that you use positive confrontation. Not negative confrontation, but positive confrontation or encouragement with her. Can you talk about how you use that? 

01:46:10
JUDITH BECK Well I think it's particularly important with depressed patients because they only see the negative. They're not, they screen out, because of the depression they're not really letting in the positive data. And so I try to point out to depressed patients the positive things that I do see going on. So I'm really giving honest encouragement. Positive encouragement. In order to help her see that some of her thoughts are inaccurate and especially the view of herself is not completely accurate. 

01:46:40
JON CARLSON So let's watch how you create a perceptual alternative for her. 

01:46:40
LATRICE . . . I want it though. 

01:46:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:46:45
LATRICE You know I really do. 

01:46:45
JUDITH BECK Well maybe important thing to remember is, I want independence so badly, that I'm making the steps toward it. And certainly going out and looking at apartments is very good. 

01:47:00
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:00
JUDITH BECK And when we talked about it, first you said you were confused about what to do next, and then we talked about it for another minute, and then you were very clear about what to do next. 

01:47:10
LATRICE Yeah. 

01:47:10
JUDITH BECK So my sense is that you really are going in the right direction. 

01:47:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:10
JUDITH BECK You've got a good head on your shoulders, and you know what to do. . . 

01:47:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:15
JUDITH BECK And the depression is probably holding you back a little bit. 

01:47:15
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:15
JUDITH BECK And your fears may be holding you back a little bit too. 

01:47:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:20
JUDITH BECK But what I see is that you're plowing ahead, and you're looking at apartments, you're doing things to try to make your life better. 

01:47:30
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:30
JUDITH BECK What do you think that says about you as a person? 

01:47:30
LATRICE That I, that I'm trying . . . 

01:47:35
JUDITH BECK I wonder if you're stronger than you think you are. 

01:47:35
LATRICE I want, I don't know. I wonder. I want to be stronger. 

01:47:40
JUDITH BECK Mm-hm. 

01:47:40
LATRICE I want to be stronger and independent. I, ah, and I feel so sad and burdened, but . . . 

01:47:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:47:45
LATRICE I really do. 

01:47:45
JUDITH BECK Well I think you're making some good steps toward it. The other thing that I was trying to get across tonight is that the reason you feel so sad and anxious sometimes are because of thoughts that you have. 

01:47:55
LATRICE Okay. 

01:47:55
JUDITH BECK So if you have thoughts like, 'What, if, um, if I lose mom before I get my independence I won't make it.' Those kind of thoughts are going to undermine you. 

01:48:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:48:10
JUDITH BECK And make you feel really anxious or sad. 

01:48:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:48:10
JUDITH BECK And you can't stop the thoughts from coming into your head, but once they come into your head you can say to yourself, 'Well wait a minute, how do I know that that's really true? Maybe it's not really true.' 

01:48:20
LATRICE Okay. 

01:48:20
JON CARLSON In that segment I saw you really kind of switch from beginning as a cheer leader and then moving on to becoming a teacher. 

01:48:30
JUDITH BECK Right. I think that's right. 

01:48:35
JON CARLSON And, and it sounds like that's the kind of thing that you want to do with the end, is to leave somebody with some hope instilled in them, and very specific, uh, uh, suggestions for what it is they're going to do. 

01:48:45
JUDITH BECK Yes. You know we tell patients when they first come to therapy that it's not enough just to come for 45 or 50-minutes a week. That they need to learn certain things in therapy that they're going to use for the rest of the week and hopefully for the rest of their lives. 

01:49:00
DIANE KJOS She, she kept saying okay, okay, and I noticed, was thinking as I was watching she, um, did have that pen in her hand, but I wondered why you didn't suggest she write down one of those statements or one of those points. 

01:49:10
JUDITH BECK And which point? 

01:49:10
DIANE KJOS Where you were talking about . . . 

01:49:15
JUDITH BECK Specifically? 

01:49:15
DIANE KJOS . . .I've already started to make a decision. Or I'm moving on, I wondered if that would be helpful to remember those. 

01:49:20
JUDITH BECK It probably would have been helpful, and I, to be honest at that time why I didn't have her write down now. My sense is that I thought that I had given her enough to write down . . . 

01:49:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:49:30
JUDITH BECK . . .and giving her more at this point . . . 

01:49:30
DIANE KJOS Right. 

01:49:30
JUDITH BECK . . .might might be confusing to her, or overwhelming to her. 

01:49:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:49:35
JUDITH BECK So I think that that's what was going through my mind at the time. 

01:49:40
DIANE KJOS Okay. Yeah. 

01:49:40
JON CARLSON In this next and final segment that we're going to look at is the closing piece and in this you continue to solicit feedback from her. Uh, is that how you close an interview? 

01:49:50
JUDITH BECK Yes. Getting feedback from clients is very important. As I was saying earlier, if we see that a patient is having a, an emotional shift right in the session itself, is suddenly looking unhappy or scared or hopeless or irritated, right at the moment we ask for feedback, and say, 'What's going through your mind right this minute? Right now?' Uh, if we don't see those kinds of shifts, then certainly by the end of the interview we want to ask, 'What did you think about the interview? What did you think. . . Anything you thought I got wrong?' Or, 'Anything that bothered you?' Because we really want to tailor the therapy for the patient. If the patient is having automatic thoughts negative thoughts about herself or about therapist or about the therapy it will interfere with what we're trying to do with her. 

01:50:35
JON CARLSON And it seems to me too that that tailoring is really important to make sure that your treatment sticks. I know that a hallmark of your approach is to focus on relapse and the prevention of relapse. So that when somebody leaves they don't feel good, and then or they feel good and then a couple hours they're back to where they were before. 

01:50:55
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

01:50:55
JON CARLSON How do you finish, how do you do that relapse? 

01:51:00
JUDITH BECK One part is though teaching them specific skills during the course of therapy itself. Then what we try to do is to space out sessions toward the end of therapy, so if they were coming once a week, we try to get them to come every two-weeks, and then we three and four-weeks. And in between have them practice the skills that they have learned . . . 

01:51:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:51:15
JUDITH BECK . . . that they have learned during therapy itself. 

01:51:15
JON CARLSON And then the tailoring, is to make sure that it's the right solution for her problem. 

01:51:20
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

01:51:20
JON CARLSON And, let's watch how you conclude the interview. 

01:51:30
JUDITH BECK Now, was there anything that I said tonight that you thought I misunderstood? 

01:51:35
LATRICE No. 

01:51:35
JUDITH BECK Uh, or anything that bothered you? 

01:51:40
LATRICE No. 

01:51:40
JUDITH BECK No? 

01:51:40
LATRICE No. 

01:51:40
JUDITH BECK Okay, and anything in particular you liked about what we talked about? 

01:51:45
LATRICE Yes. About writing down the advantages and the disadvantages . . . 

01:51:50
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:51:50
LATRICE . . . about making a decision. 

01:51:50
JUDITH BECK And that will help you with other decisions as well. 

01:51:50
LATRICE Yeah, I, I, I see there that it is . . . 

01:51:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. 

01:51:55
LATRICE . . . it makes a lot of sense. 

01:51:55
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Is it, most of the time people just have these advantages and disadvantages swimming in their heads, but it's much easier if you put them down on paper. 

01:52:05
LATRICE Right. 

01:52:05
JUDITH BECK Then you can go and get a better idea. 

01:52:10
LATRICE Okay. 

01:52:10
JUDITH BECK Good, well thanks for coming in tonight Ms. Latrice. 

01:52:10
LATRICE Oh, you're welcome. 

01:52:10
JUDITH BECK It's been a pleasure talking to you. 

01:52:10
LATRICE Thank you. 

01:52:10
JON CARLSON So visibly we see a change with her. She doesn't look like a 41 on the depression scale. 

01:52:15
JUDITH BECK That's right. And I think what has happened is that we've been able to undermine her belief that she is helpless and inadequate. And particularly what she liked was this advantage/ disadvantage analysis that I taught her. 

01:52:30
DIANE KJOS Mm-hm. 

01:52:30
JUDITH BECK And I think she saw that by doing this kind of technique she could make decisions better and that probably she could stand up to her family better. 

01:52:35
DIANE KJOS She has something concrete to say. 

01:52:40
JUDITH BECK Right. 

01:52:40
DIANE KJOS 'I've thought this through.' 

01:52:40
JUDITH BECK Exactly. 

01:52:40
DIANE KJOS The other thing I thought was interesting was when you asked her for some negative feedback. It was like, 'You're kidding.' The look on her face. 

01:52:45
JUDITH BECK Yeah. Patients often have that reaction at first. 

01:52:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:52:50
JUDITH BECK And in a real therapy session I might have gone into more of a rationale as to why I'm asking these questions. 

01:52:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah. That was so, it just certainly showed a great deal of respect for her, and I think that's a piece of it. Do you? 

01:53:00
JON CARLSON I see. 

01:53:00
JUDITH BECK Right. Part of the collaborative nature . . . 

01:53:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:53:00
JUDITH BECK . . .that together we have to figure out what's going to help you. 

01:53:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:53:05
JON CARLSON Um, thank you for collaborating with us, and let us see some insight into your work. 

01:53:10
JUDITH BECK It was a pleasure. 

01:53:10
DIANE KJOS Thank you.
