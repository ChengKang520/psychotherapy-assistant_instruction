Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources INTRODUCTION “Art Therapy Has Many Faces” Judith A. Rubin, Ph.D., ATR-BC 

00:00:10
JUDITH A. RUBIN My name is Judy Rubin, I’m an art therapist. I started out as an artist, became an art educator, then stumbled into art therapy in the 1960s and taught art education classes, ended up studying psychoanalysis, so I became an analyst and also went for study for Ph.D., which allowed me to be licensed as a psychologist, but although I have these other identities my heart and my soul are in art therapy and in the late 90s I was writing an introductory textbook about art therapy and suggested to the publisher that I would like to do at that time a videotape to go with it, the publisher agreed and so I began to collect material for a videotape. I had done some early work with Fred Rogers as the art lady on his television program and then learning the power of film and so I had made other films over the years starting with 16 millimeter then videotape, so that seemed like a reasonable thing to do, as it happened the publisher was sold to another publisher, who was sold to another publisher and by the time the book was ready to be put to press, there was not such enthusiasm for a videotape to go with it, but since I had already started the process of collecting material I thought I’m going to go ahead and make something that will be like the book which is art therapy and introduction it's an introduction to art therapy, the sources and resources of the field and I think I can try to do that in under an hour to give people a kind of overview, which I tried to do in the book of this field in which by then I had spent over 30 years and with the help of a excellent and talented young editor (inaudible ) who shot some of the footage and who really helped me to select footage and to arrange it in a way that was artistic and at the same time educational we made this film and in the DVD you can see that is organized according to chapters which roughly parallel the sections of the book which I’m actually currently revising and it should be out in 2009. And I’m really thrilled that it has been used by so many different people not just art therapist and people around the world in fact there is a Chinese language version that’s going to be distributed by the Taiwan Institute of psychotherapy.

[non-English text] Art Therapy Has Many Faces Art Therapy…an Idea whose Time had Come 

00:03:35
JUDITH A. RUBIN So without any kind of promotion or advertising we have actually sold several thousand copies, because I think this film does tell the story of art therapy in a way that covers the water from(ph) now in the future we want to make more films about, in more depth about the sections. Art therapy has many faces it's just that, it's a film about the many faces of the people who do art therapy the providers and the people who receive art therapy, who are as varied as could be in the many different ways in which it happens not only in the United States, but around the world, I hope that you enjoy it.

00:05:15
NARRATOR Since time immemorial the use of art in healing is rested on a belief in the magic power of the image. The source of the cave paintings of Lascaux, the sculptures of Easter Island, the Mandalas of Tibetan Buddhism, the sand paintings of native Americans and the Navaho dream catcher to protect us from bad dreams. 

00:05:45
Vincent Van Gogh 

00:05:50
NARRATOR Van Gogh was one of many artists who created to cope with their anguish, so did Jackson Pollack. 

00:05:55
JACKSON POLLOCK Psychoanalytic Drawings Voice-Jackson Pollock 

00:05:55
JACKSON POLLOCK Well you are painting out of your own conscious figures are bound to emerge, it's pretty negative stuff so far, I have been going through violent changes the past couple of years. 

00:06:05
Jackson Pollock 

00:06:05
JACKSON POLLOCK God know what will come out of it all. 

00:06:10
Marty has Schizophrenia 

00:06:10
MARTY COHEN Artist You know people go to the gym to work out and stuff, but another way of doing it is just coming to the studio and going the rounds with the painting like a punching bag or something. 

00:06:25
Darcy has Lymphoma 

00:06:25
DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was an intensive care would be when I was feeling more conscious and because I was sedated with a lot of stuff and I think it was more the concern to see if I still had it in me, and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line it hadn’t been taken away. I think my art really helped me, because it was the only way I could hold on to my own identity and I think if I didn’t have that it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process and you need something, you need something to hold on to that’s you. 

00:07:05
Frida Kahlo 

00:07:05
NARRATOR Frida Kahlo only began painting at age 18 during a long convalescents from an accident. 

00:07:10
Frida’s body was almost destroyed in the accident, her spinal column was broken in three places, she had a triple fracture of the pelvis from the steel handrail that had literally squared(ph) her body and (inaudible ) her hip and coming out through the vagina. The doctors did not expect her to live, when she felt well enough she painted using a special easel that allowed her to paint lying flat on her back. Painting had become an ever more important source of spiritual support and Frida longed to get well so that she could work for longer hours. ”When I leave the hospital two months from now”, she said after six operations, “there are three things I want to do, paint, paint and paint.” 

00:08:05
NARRATOR Rob Weinstein turned to painting to deal with memories of abuse. 

00:08:10
ROB WEINSTEIN That night at a certain age it was, it was always just me and ah… me in the doorway, it just me and the door way and the real light, you know kind of a ray of light that came in from the hall into my bedroom and I would, I would be up at night just watching that you know my father’s feet cross out (inaudible ) that was going to be a very bad night, if, if nobody walked in that was a damn good night. If other people look at that painting the can learn a lot about sexual abuse, because the painting is not really in my father’s body, the dominance is not sexual, if you look at that painting, the, the, the arm has such a need to control and own and show the child I can destroy you at any moment. 

00:09:15
NARRATOR And Elizabeth Layton was battling a lifelong depression. 

00:09:20
ELIZABETH LAYTON You heard and you heard and you heard and, and then you go around and around and around, so I thought I can’t stand this I will do something. After (inaudible ) that my sister wrote and urged me to, to do something may be she was into drawing at that time and she thought if I were to draw in my (inaudible ) and everybody said you don’t look like that, but I knew I look like that, because I had drawn that out of the mirror. 

00:09:55

00:10:05

00:14:40
MARGARET NAUMBURG Well, I moved into it myself in psychoanalysis. I made pictures of my dreams and fantasies. 

00:14:50
NARRATOR In 1941 she was invited to work in a psychiatric hospital by its director Dr. Noland Lewis(ph). 

00:14:55
MARGARET NAUMBURG The great thing for me was the meeting with Lewis, who recognized what I had done in education with analysis, that made him immediately offer me a children’s group to work with a series of five or six children once or twice a week using art, art therapy in their association.

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:00
A major problem I have is bottling up anger and not having the words for the anger and ah… what it is help me do is put things down visually that I wouldn’t even know what within my mind, so I drew this figure that had all this colors inside of it with the big dark line around it and the dark line was a way of keeping those feelings inside and that’s where I have been walking around like (inaudible ) well and everything in the outside world seems to be (inaudible ) to me. 

00:22:45

I made the figure, I made the mouth and then the problem was how to get those feelings out of the mouth. 

00:23:15
“But it’s not a song.” 

00:23:15
PIERRE BOENIG “What is it?” 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:25
And so I started putting in colors and then I just let loose and then I just put colors everywhere, I let, I let the colors come out, but the figure still had color in it, so the figure didn’t moves it's life, because it, because she let her feelings out, she became part of the outside world. Because when you express yourself you never know exactly how it's gonna come out. 

00:23:50
PIERRE BOENIG Yeah, you are right. 

00:23:55
I feel sense of relief. 

00:24:00

He didn’t talk, but they communicate it long clear. 

00:49:25
DARCY LYNN Artist I think it’s a way to express. All those things, they’re afraid to express, people are afraid to express so much, their fear, pain uh… loneliness embarrassment and all sort of things that, that no one else can have any idea of and they can put that into art. 

00:49:45

The possibility of creating symbols give a freedom to say something that maybe very painful or very important, very personal, but at the same time it is half-way, it is said, but it is not said. And so, it is umm… steel under their control. So, art therapy fulfills that very special kind of (inaudible ) between being silent and talking about something. 

00:50:35
For me, in art therapy the feelings have come up the most of the hard ones, the life and death issues and how hard I’ve had to struggle to stay alive, and how hard it is to keep going.

Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center and Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic present THE GREEN CREATURE WITHIN… ART AND DRAMA IN GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY 

00:56:20
[sil.] 

00:56:25
NARRATOR Two hours a week for two years, a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem, each had a different label, but all were hurting. To meet their different needs, we made available a wide range of flexible materials, which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities, these adolescents might come to find, to know and to master what one member called that green creature within. The expressive media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance, as well as photography. Super-8 movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic, but psychic perspective. 

00:57:30
Take it easy… Take it easy… Don’t let the sound on your own wheels drive you crazy. We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again, so open up… 

00:57:50
NARRATOR Talking directly about sensitive issues was often painful. For some like Matthew it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. Some of the art work is almost painfully eloquent such as Cindy’s two agonized faces made after witnessing an especially traumatic event. Marlene herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies, only then could she talk openly about the experience and her own feelings of loss. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles, most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically. 

00:58:35
Bill Borrero Child Psychiatrist Ellie Irwin Drama Therapist 

00:58:40
NARRATOR There are times however, but it may be teaching skills or helping a group member with a task like helping Sherry make her paper mache sculpture. There were leaders, who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in anyway that might be needed. And most of all it was a sense of fun, of joy, of playfulness, which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way. There was a feeling of community in which the group members learned from each other and especially learned about themselves in their journey with the green creature within.

Give me (inaudible ). 

00:59:48
To which… 

00:59:48
JUDITH A. RUBIN As the family selects puppets, the therapist observes their individual behaviors and their interaction. Some puppets are chosen immediately, others are rejected or avoided. The selection process provides the therapist with important clues about the dynamics of the family. The particular meaning that the puppet has for the person usually becomes clear through the interaction and conflict portrayed within the story, as well as during the discussion after the story when each person is asked to think about which puppets they chose and why. 

01:00:25
How about introducing your puppets to everybody, so all the puppets can have a chance to meet each other? 

01:00:30
RON Okay. 

01:00:30
Dad has to go first. 

01:00:35
RON Okay, my name is Ron. Good to see you. And this is duck, okay. 

01:00:40
I would like you to take a couple of minutes and to try to think together of where you could start a story using some of the puppets that you’ve got. 

01:00:50
JUDITH A. RUBIN Observing the formation of the story, it is often possible to determine family roles. Most families work best when hidden behind a puppet stage, which provides psychic, as well as aesthetic distance. 

01:01:05
RON Okay and all these creatures… 

01:01:05
Shut up. 

01:01:10
RON …some may look mean… right, they’re all just like us. 

01:01:15
Uh…Huh… 

01:01:15
RON Okay. And so we will start first I will have to change into my fantasy costume. Are you ready? 

01:01:20
Yes, and I’m going to have my coffee. 

01:01:25
RON Okay, go. Please do that, I’m sure you’ll look much better when you’re done. Okay. 

01:01:30
Okay. 

01:01:30
RON Hello, magic lobster. 

01:01:30
Hello. 

01:01:30
RON How was your trip? 

01:01:35
Fine. 

01:01:35
RON Excellent. 

01:01:35
I just want to tell you guys… 

01:01:35
RON What? 

01:01:35
…from one species to another that you can just live under water and be cool. 

01:01:45
RON Would you like to sing a song for us? 

01:01:45
Okay. 

01:01:45
RON Okay, sing a song. If we all came back together, we brought everything back with us. 

01:01:50
JUDITH A. RUBIN When the story stops, the therapist can continue the interaction by talking directly to the puppets. 

01:01:55
If we could show your story to an audience on television for example, what could we tell them would be the moral of the story? 

01:02:05
You can go somewhere with… with a stranger, but you ended up in something that you don’t know about. 

01:02:15
Uh…Huh… 

01:02:15
More of course I would say that there is a lot to learn from a lobster.

"You Can Learn a Lot From a Lobster” Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources Playing: Pretending Spontaneous Drama with Children 

01:02:40
JUDITH A. RUBIN Playing, pretending, spontaneous drama with children. 

01:02:50
[sil.] 

01:02:55
JUDITH A. RUBIN Playing, creating it’s as naturalist can be. Now kids often play out things they are wondering about. It’s their way of trying to understand what has happened or what could happen. Like doctor play, most kids have been poked and locked down and examined and maybe even hurt by the doctor. So it feels good to turn it around and be the doctor and do all those things to someone else, being active instead of passive. Creating from past experiences and feelings, they project part of themselves into what they make. 

01:03:40
Hello friend. 

01:03:40
Hello darling. 

01:03:45
You are a bird, aren’t you? I’m a bird too. 

01:03:45
I’m a boy. 

01:03:50
I’m a girl. 

01:03:50
JUDITH A. RUBIN Sometimes, it’s even easier to talk about feelings with puppets like feelings of affection as Shirley and Fay are doing. Kids have a lot of stories to play out too. Sometimes they are funny stories like when Dana(ph) pretended to be a statue for sale in the store and Ralph began to argue about the price. Well, it was so funny that even Dana(ph) had a hard time to keep from laughing. 

01:04:20
348 dollars. So it would be 348 dollars. 

01:04:25
RALPH 348 dollars, look at this (inaudible ). It really should be… look at there button is missing. Leave it, I want to, I want to (inaudible ). Well, look at this. 

01:04:40
Thank you. 

01:04:45
RALPH Let’s go. 

01:04:45
I had a dream and it was so scary that it woke me up. Ah… while I was sleeping, I heard a noise and it was like someone breaking glass, so I woke up and then I saw a man and he had a big long knife and then he saw me and he broke the window and he came pull… 

01:05:05
JUDITH A. RUBIN Now playing out dreams can be scary, but if kids talk about it when it’s over, it helps to know that other people have scary dreams too and the dreams aren’t for real, but they come from feelings inside and that it helps to talk about it. 

01:05:20
Wayne Cook Drama Therapist 

01:05:25
JUDITH A. RUBIN Of course, it takes a special kind of grownup to play with kids this way. A grownup who can really listen, a grownup who remembers what it’s like to be young to have all those thoughts and ideas and feelings and stories inside, just waiting for a time and a place to be expressed. 

01:05:50

ROSEMARIE HANNA I’ll do jump. Jump, jump, jump, jump… 

01:06:15

01:06:50
JUDITH A. RUBIN At the western Pennsylvania school for blind children Jim Gardner and Roni Ostfield work with blind and partially-sighted children in a creative dramatics program. Spontaneous play can help to organize and make sense of the outer world as well as the inner world a feeling. At times, improvisations are humorous that males reflect underlying worries as in this unplanned drama. 

01:07:15
JIM GARDNER Well, let’s go, come on let’s go. 

01:07:20
Yeah. 

01:07:20
JIM GARDNER Come on, come on. 

01:07:25
Let’s try. 

01:07:25

01:07:30

01:07:40
RONI OSTFIELD I’m sorry, I’m her psychiatrist and she escaped from the, the asylum. I would like to take her back where she belongs… 

01:07:45
JIM GARDNER Oh, oh there is more to this than I thought. 

01:07:45
JUDITH A. RUBIN For the most children such experiences can be therapeutic, but some children need more specialized help. Drama therapy focuses on the understanding and working through of conflicts. 

01:08:00
Oh burned! 

01:08:00
ELLIE IRWIN And now you have a burn due to bad things are happening to you. 

01:08:05
Oh I. 

01:08:10
JUDITH A. RUBIN In the drama, feelings and fantasies are expressed and accepted as therapist and child work towards clarification, control and change. Puppet play and improvisation can be valuable diagnostic as well as therapeutic tools for children and their families. 

01:08:30
Roar… roar… roar and attack them all, oh well, get out and gonna help. Roar… roar… roar come on let’s go, come on, oh, my nose. 

01:08:45

NARRATOR This is WBBN (inaudible ) from Pennsylvania group of blind children. This is the art group, kids like art, art like them. It doesn’t matter what you can do, you can do art, real good. We have some more work to do or show you what we’re gonna do. Watch. 

01:09:30
”We’ll Show You What We’re Gonna Do!” 

01:09:35
NARRATOR We really didn’t know what was gonna happen. When we started we were told that the children had all kinds of problems, things that would make it hard for them to do what we expected them to do. We wanted to see what children like these could do when given art materials and offered freedom. And these weren’t just ordinary children. They were the kind of children that are called special or exceptional, which is a polite way of saying that they had a lot of things wrong with them. They had labels like mentally retarded, brain damaged, cerebral palsied and the one label that all of them shared no matter what their other disability was that they were blind. 

01:10:40
[sil.] 

01:10:45
NARRATOR And then there is David, who zoomed around the paper with marker, with brush who took all the energy he used to use to bite and pinch and kick and put it into his paintbrush and put it into his pictures. Children have so much to say, it helps to know that somebody is interested in listening, in hearing all the ideas and feelings that get stirred up when children use art materials. 

01:11:20
Oh (inaudible ) angrier too, he is really angry. 

01:11:25
He is angry as (inaudible )? 

01:11:30
No, no, more, he is even angrier. Ooh! He is cutting holes in her, ah, this is easy to cut. 

01:11:45
Now I take the needle and you stick it right in here, then when you are done, it’s all over. 

01:12:00
NARRATOR Peter remembered his experience with a doctor in the hospital. 

01:12:05
PETER This is the operating room and that’s where Dr. Seeber(ph) was. Then, then the doctor proceeded with the operation, then after they took out my hernia from here to here then after they were done, then they put me back in the bed. Well, I thought that it was a good operation. I never knew how to paint a picture of an operating room before.

And also the sense of control that you have over your life and you are very confused and it… it also leads to a lot of depression, but art, if they begin to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, their infinite choices in art and their dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

01:16:30
Darcy has Lymphoma 

01:16:40
DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was in intensive care it would be when I was feeling more conscious and because I was sedated with a lot of stuff and I think it was more of the concern to see if I still had it in me and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line that hadn’t been taken away. I think my art, my art really helped to me because it was the only way I could hold onto my own identity and I think if I didn’t have that it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process and you need something, you need something to hold on to, that’s you. 

01:17:20
NARRATOR In work, which is true to both art and therapy, people are helped to find, to know and to accept the true self, which may be hidden within behind the masks they wear. 

01:17:40
It let you let out like that we let out what like the way I was mad at and stuff like that. 

01:17:45
What were you mad at? 

01:17:50
Umm… just being in a hospital period. 

01:17:55
And you feel some when you draw it, you get into a space and it’s like I don’t know it’s, it’s, I hadn’t been there so long that I didn’t want to go there for some other reason I guess, so I may be as I afraid of it that I couldn’t do it, you know but slowly but surely I started doing it again and it was like yeah.

01:19:05
DARCY LYNN I think it’s a way to express all those things they’re afraid to express. People are afraid to express so much, their fear, pain, loneliness, embarrassment, all sorts of things that that no one else can have any idea of and they can put that into art. 

01:19:25
JIMMY LEE SUDDUTH Artist When I first started I was 3 year old, like a painter, I would be… I won’t be low, I won’t be alone. (inaudible ). If I couldn’t… if I couldn’t paint that, and I got to (inaudible ) paint on that. I paint some more time. 

01:19:45
Expressive Media Inc. arts therapy films and resources CHILDREN AND THE ARTS A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

01:20:05
NARRATOR Children and the arts go together, because the arts are a way of taking what comes naturally to children and giving it form. We all know that kids like to move. 

01:20:20
[sil.] 

01:20:30
NARRATOR One of the most helpful things about the arts is that they give children ways of exploring and expressing and articulating those scary feelings. You like wanna mess with your brother, but it’s better if you mess with the finger paint. And you might feel like pounding your sister, but it’s a lot safer to pound a drum. The angry feelings can go into a story too. The killing is make believe and that makes it safe. The punch that can hurt can become a dance, it can become so highly stylized and ritualized that it becomes a thing of beauty. And so those scary, angry, messy feelings can be turned through the arts into something lovely. Now, the same fellow who has two puppets so angry at each other can also have two puppets who feel very loving toward each other, because children have all sorts of feelings inside them and the child who begins to feel good, because he knows how to do something, feels even better because he’s found some grownup who believes in his ability and who believes in him as a person who shows him that he likes him just the way he is and that good happy feeling is the feeling that children can get from the arts, from finding out what they can do and learning how to do it. Feeling strong and proud and really good about themselves, and in the process grown.

01:23:00
NARRATOR These 4-year old children are choosing parts of themselves that they want to explore by beginning with an experience with each part. One at a time, they are gradually moving into a richer consciousness of their bodies. Their first awareness of self for every human being comes through the mother’s touch and through the close contact with her body. Thus the first sense of self is the body sense, awakened by the mother’s care. This in turn encourages each child to explore his own body, beginning an infancy and continuing as he grows. When I first met Amy and Deborah, two of the children I worked with individually, they were psychotic in the autistic stage of development. They like the young infant, spent all of their time stimulating themselves. Their autistic gestures were ritualistic, highly stylized patterns of movement. Communication was then only possible in one way through our bodies. Since their tiny limited worlds were intensely physical, I tried to enter their worlds and speak their language by reflecting their movements. In the beginning, this was simply direct imitation. By doing what she was doing, I was trying to tell her that I liked her just the way she was without asking anything of her. I wanted her to know that she was safe to be completely herself. Then when she was ready, we could begin to share.

NARRATOR Each child within the safety of the room and situation, had I think begun to trust me. Up to now, she had permitted touch, but not enough to relax and become passive like a baby. Both girls were now in the earlier stage of symbiosis and spent most of their time wanting to be held. Perhaps it was at this point that they had begun to experience themselves as one of two people in a relationship and could then begin to grow and go through some crucial faces of normal development, which they missed the first time around. These children then begin to explore my body just as the normal child begins to explore the mother’s body. Mutual trust did now exist at the body level. It was beginning to look like a normal relationship.

NARRATOR If these adults have reached a better understanding of themselves in relation to their own bodies, perhaps, their words and actions can be more honestly reflective of what they really mean. Perhaps then there will be fewer difficulties in communicating with each other and with the children in their lives. After working with children in varying degrees of mental illness, I have learned that body language can be the first means of successful communication. Sometimes, it can also be the basis from which verbal communication can grow. We can provide opportunities, in which they can be themselves, follow their internal rhythms and discover that their bodies can come alive through movement. Their bodies can then become a beautifully natural part of their speaking, of their listening, of their moving and growing through a time and space called childhood.
