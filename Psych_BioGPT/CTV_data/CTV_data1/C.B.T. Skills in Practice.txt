CBT SKILLS IN PRACTICE with FRANK WILLS and JAN GRAY a programme from the School of Health & Social Sciences University of Wales, Newport 

00:00:45
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons and I teach counseling at the University of Wales, Newport. During the summer of last year, Frank Wills, a colleague of mine, conducted a series of CBT sessions with another colleague Jan Gray acting in the role of client. Frank is a hugely experienced CBT therapist with subject leader in counseling here for very many years. He’s also the author of a number of books on CBT, the most recent being Sage Publication, Skills in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Jan is also a CBT therapist and one of the lectures here on our diploma course. And as I said she was playing the role of a client. Though she was playing that role the therapy session themselves were completely unscripted and give a very clear demonstration of CBT skill and practice. We gotto look at some excerpts from those sessions and we’ve got two clear aims in doing this. Firstly, we want to show CBT skills being implemented within a sound therapeutic relationship. And secondly, we aim to show the development of skill use and the development of that therapeutic relationship over a number of sessions. There are number of therapy tapes showing one off session, but few that show how therapy actually unfolds. So Frank this was a role-play, well how much did you feel like the really thing? 

00:02:20
FRANK WILLS Well, I think the first instance it… it is quite smooth. Umm… But it felt pretty really actually. I mean, we did have a sort of a vague outline of how things were going to go, but I didn’t know from movement to movement what would come up. And the worst and quite surprising turns in it and some quite strongly, emotionally fell material came out. 

00:02:40
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, and we’re gonna at excepts from all four of the sessions. Ah… What are we gonna see there? 

00:02:50
FRANK WILLS There will be three main areas really. Firstly, assessment and then some cognitive behavioral interventions. And then finally a little bit about reviewing and evaluating what is going on in the therapy. 

00:03:00
MIKE SIMMONS So we’re going to see assessment first. Ah… What do we need to say to set the scene? 

00:03:05
FRANK WILLS Well, we come into the session ah… little bit after it started. So the clients already told me that she has a difficulty with… in the area of social anxiety. And what I’m now asking her to do is to give me a specific example. Getting a specific example is particularly important in the early stages of assessment in CBT. Because what it gives you is an intro into that the whole that the clients negative patterns play themselves out. 

00:03:35
MIKE SIMMONS So what you would looking out for now? 

00:03:40
FRANK WILLS Well, first of all notice that I get the client to use first past and present tense language. This often seems to get closer to the emotion immediacy of the event you’re trying to reach. And it does show incidentally that… that CBT is interested in emotions, this is a bit of myth that it… it doesn’t such an interest. Secondly, even though I’m only really exploring things at this stage, I do take some opportunity to challenge some of the negative thinking. For example, how many people in the room actually were paying attention to what she were saying. And finally umm… I’m also looking to do a little bit of educational input too on the nature of what are anxiety is. For example, the way anxiety effects ones attention and also memories. And in fact umm… she recovers a memory that somebody did come up to her at the end of the presentation and… 

00:04:45
MIKE SIMMONS Alright. 

00:04:45
FRANK WILLS …give us some positive feedback. 

00:04:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah! So they are the key things going on, but in fact you’ve written a lot more about this in the booklet that accompanies this program. 

00:04:50
FRANK WILLS That’s right. 

00:04:55
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Let’s have a look at the first instinct then. 

00:04:55
Excerpt 1 (from Session 1) 

00:04:55
JAN GRAY It was in that lecture theater and it was a lunch time lecture. And umm… I really wasn’t feeling very well anyway that day. And ah… so physically I wasn’t feeling well. And we were having to give a lecture using PowerPoint and I’m not very conversant with PowerPoint. 

00:05:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:20
JAN GRAY And so it came for my turn to… to get up there. So I was already thinking, you know they’re going to see that I don’t how to use the PowerPoint. Umm… And I was starting to… to give my talk and I was talking about my product. And most of the people in the audience, I don’t think it wasn’t that their area of interest, because I could see that they were looking fairly bored. 

00:05:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:45
JANE GRAY And I could see there were people sort of talking to each other at the back and which sort of made me lose my concentration a bit. And as… as I lost my concentration umm… it was really hard to start talking again. It’s as if, you know, it’s as if I totally lost my thread. And so I just stood there and I could then see them getting even more bored and even more umm… you know aggregative with me. And so I just sort of wound up really quickly and… and sort of made my exit. 

00:06:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:25
JANE GRAY Umm… And it was awful. It was awful. 

00:06:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Alright. It sounds like it was kind of you felt embarrassed and. 

00:06:35
JAN GRAY It was… It was awful and I’m sure that they’ll never ever, ever ask me back again. 

00:06:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… Okay. I mean, do you mind if we… we just umm… as I say put that a microscope… 

00:06:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:06:45
FRANK WILLS …just a little bit. Can you sort of get back there, you know can we… 

00:06:45
JAN GRAY Oh yes! 

00:06:50
FRANK WILLS …you know can you just sort of umm… what was an umm… I want to try and encourage you to speak in the present tense for a movement. You know, you’re there back in the classroom but what are do you wearing? 

00:07:00
JAN GRAY What am I wearing? 

00:07:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:00
JAN GRAY Umm… Well I’m wearing my presentation suit, because I wearing an sort of a trouser suit, which was fairly dark colors, quite smart. But I… I’m not feeling my best, because as said I’m not feeling very well. I’ve had an upset stomach, so my stomach is not… 

00:07:20
FRANK WILLS Sort of rumbling a bit. 

00:07:20
JAN GRAY Rumbling a bit and I’m actually in quite a bit of pain, and… 

00:07:25
FRANK WILLS And… And what do you see in the room? 

00:07:30
JAN GRAY What I see in the room? Just tears of people sitting in front of me and… and they haven’t dimmed the lights so I can’t see them all. Umm… And they’re in the white coats and they got the stethoscopes, so I know they’re doctors. 

00:07:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:40
JAN GRAY So I know they’re clever than me. And umm… they just… They’ve had a presentation by you know my colleague. 

00:07:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:50
JAN GRAY And which I have to say was quite boring, so already they’re fairly sort of bored. 

00:07:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:00
JAN GRAY Umm… And I know that the product I’m talking about is something they don’t know, so I can see that they’re, some of them are sort of switched off and some of them sort of talking to each other and looking down and umm… 

00:08:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Alright, now do you remember when I briefly umm… introduced you to cognitive therapy, what we were talking on the phone. 

00:08:25
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:08:25
FRANK WILLS And I mentioned this idea about negative thoughts. 

00:08:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:08:30
FRANK WILLS Umm… I’m just wondering what the thoughts that we’re going through your mind where… 

00:08:35
JAN GRAY Well. 

00:08:35
FRANK WILLS …any kind of… 

00:08:35
JAN GRAY They’re not listening to me. 

00:08:35
FRANK WILLS …that, yeah, yeah. 

00:08:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:08:40
FRANK WILLS And they’re bored? 

00:08:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, they’re bored. 

00:08:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:08:40
JAN GRAY I’m not making any sense here. 

00:08:45
FRANK WILLS Umm… They’re cleverer than you? 

00:08:45
JAN GRAY Yeah they’re clever than me. Yeah. Umm… Yeah, I think those were the main sort of, I fell… 

00:09:00
FRANK WILLS Just… Just… Just one interesting thing you said that was, you said that your, your colleague hadn’t done a very good presentation. 

00:09:05
JAN GRAY No. 

00:09:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so… 

00:09:05
JAN GRAY But he is a doctor. 

00:09:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so what’s the significance of that? 

00:09:15
JAN GRAY But he’s clever than me. 

00:09:15
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:09:15
JAN GRAY He’s, you know he is… 

00:09:20
FRANK WILLS But he… But he hasn’t tell the interest of the audience, you know he is clever? 

00:09:25
JAN GRAY No. 

00:09:25
FRANK WILLS Right, So… So I’m tell if something doesn’t it… it doesn’t tell us a… 

00:09:35
JAN GRAY Well, either he is an incredibly boring speaker or the fairly sort of… sort of rude group, I suppose. 

00:09:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… I’m not be gonna use it very much sort of difficult group. But does he perhaps tell us, you know that being… Does it tell us being clever means you’ll interest people? 

00:10:00
JAN GRAY Not really, I suppose. It doesn’t really, does it? 

00:10:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:00
JAN GRAY No actually it doesn’t. Some of the best speakers I’ve heard have not been particularly technical. 

00:10:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so… So that’s one negative thought we might want to review then… 

00:10:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:10:15
FRANK WILLS …about this thing about whether you know you are not as clever as them. 

00:10:20
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:10:20
FRANK WILLS I mean, but we’ll be looking more though what the… the meaning of that was. 

00:10:25
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:10:25
FRANK WILLS In this context it seems to be the negative thought seems to be that because you’re not clever… clever as them, maybe a question mark, inverted commas, we don’t know that… 

00:10:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:10:35
FRANK WILLS …for sure that you won’t be out of interest. 

00:10:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:10:40
FRANK WILLS But that seems a bit questionable based on that. 

00:10:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:10:45
FRANK WILLS The… The instance of your colleagues presentation? 

00:10:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:10:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah! And you know another interesting thing that you… you said. I mean, can you remember roughly how many people were… were sort of in… in the room? 

00:11:00
JAN GRAY Hmm… Umm… They were probably about, it feels like hundreds but they were probably about 40 or 50. 

00:11:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah! And… And when you said you refer to some people not paying attention. 

00:11:15
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:15
FRANK WILLS Can you remember how many people that was? 

00:11:20
JAN GRAY Well I know there was a row at the back. 

00:11:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:11:20
JAN GRAY And they were like… there was somebody sitting there and then there were a couple of doctors down at the front there. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:11:30
JAN GRAY It’s just a count. 

00:11:30
FRANK WILLS So you think about three or four people something like that? 

00:11:35
JAN GRAY About… About… Slightly more than that, about four or five. 

00:11:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:11:45
FRANK WILLS So four or five people out of 50 would pretty well not paying attention to you. 

00:11:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, I see what you’re saying. 

00:11:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:11:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. It just I felt that they were the important people in the room you see. 

00:12:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! I don’t if it would be helpful at this stage. Could I try and draw a little diagram of this actually? 

00:12:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:12:10
FRANK WILLS so umm… We might think in terms of a trigger you know, what triggers off this kind of anxiety for you, you know. 

00:12:15
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:12:15
FRANK WILLS And the trigger here might be you know people looking out of the window during your presentation. 

00:12:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:12:35
FRANK WILLS So, then we have these kind of negative thoughts come… comes in. And let’s have them again and there were three or four well that is… 

00:12:45
JAN GRAY What is not then… They’re not listening to me. 

00:12:45
FRANK WILLS They’re not listening to me. 

00:12:55
JAN GRAY Because they think I’m stupid. 

00:13:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! 

00:13:05
JAN GRAY Then there was also I… I’m not… I’m not as clever as they are. 

00:13:15
FRANK WILLS Well this was the one. 

00:13:15
JAN GRAY Because I feel a fool, I think it’s… You know, I feel a fool. 

00:13:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, okay. So, I mean, you know this is a pressure situation as we’ve said before. Almost everybody seems to feel pressure in this situation. So umm… I mean, just… just thinking about other people, you know if they were doing a presentation and they started having these thoughts. 

00:13:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:13:45
FRANK WILLS They’re not listening to me, they think I’m stupid, I’m not clever as them, I feel a fool. How do you think they would, they would feel? 

00:13:50
JAN GRAY Oh they’d… they’d feel bad, wouldn’t they? 

00:13:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! And what would the badness consist though? 

00:13:55
JAN GRAY For somebody else? Yeah. 

00:14:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:00
JAN GRAY Well I think they’d feel embarrassed. 

00:14:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:14:05
JAN GRAY Nervous. Might feel angry actually. 

00:14:10
FRANK WILLS Angry, yeah. What… What about anxious? 

00:14:15
JAN GRAY Oh yes! They’d feel anxious, yeah. 

00:14:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Okay, so… So that makes sense doesn’t it? That anyone who thought those thoughts, you know that would make absolute sense that you would feel quite… it would be very hard to feel good. 

00:14:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:14:30
FRANK WILLS And feel safe and laid back. 

00:14:30
JAN GRAY It would have been… Yes. 

00:14:35
FRANK WILLS Where some people probably could do that you know, but that would be in a very small minority. So… So far this kind of makes sense. 

00:14:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:14:40
FRANK WILLS But then another bit that comes into this is that, you know how you then behave? You know I… What you do? 

00:14:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:14:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… And umm… It sounded like what… What you do if you wouldn’t when we just putting this and also actually you felt this put this in. You kind of hurry up… 

00:15:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:15:00
FRANK WILLS …and try and get over and… 

00:15:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:15:05
FRANK WILLS …done with. And you ignore, you know you try not to look at the people, yeah. And again, you know that that’s what is almost a natural behavior. Now if you… If you think you’re being exposed in a bad way most people want to run… 

00:15:25
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:15:25
FRANK WILLS …basically and… and that would make sense. 

00:15:25
JAN GRAY That’s right, yeah. I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, yeah. 

00:15:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! So umm… However though umm… if you… What… Do you think that people became aware of you sort of hurrying up and perhaps feeling a bit stuck at this… 

00:15:45
JAN GRAY I’m sure they did. I’m sure… I’m sure at that point… 

00:15:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:15:50
JAN GRAY …they… they were beginning to sort of shifting their seats and… 

00:15:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:15:55
JAN GRAY Because it was obvious that I was, you know I was, you know not finishing the presentation probably. I was, you know rushing it. 

00:16:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! So you know umm… paradoxically behaving that way might even increase them thinking this way? 

00:16:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, I’m sure it did. I’m sure it did. 

00:16:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah! Actually though umm… is there is any other way that’s… I mean, have you ever seen anyone you know sweating and suffering making a presentation? 

00:16:30
MIKE SIMMONS So that’s looking at the problem pretty much in the hearing now and that seems to be a lot of peoples perceptions of how CBT is. 

00:16:35
FRANK WILLS That’s right it is sometimes felt that CBT is really only interested in umm… the symptoms and the current problems. And there was some truth in that ah… CBT is nearly always interested in the clients learning history as well. Shortly after the session that we’ve just been looking at about the presentation, we began to explore the client’s history a little bit. And I asked her to speculate on what the links between some of her early history and what was going on now were. And she intensified the fact that she felt quite small whilst giving presentations. 

00:17:20
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:17:20
FRANK WILLS And she also talked about her relationship with her brother and sister who were some what dominant over her. 

00:17:25
MIKE SIMMONS And you also asked her about her mother and father and how that fitted in? 

00:17:30
FRANK WILLS That’s right that’s the point at which we joined the tape. 

00:17:35
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so what you’ll be looking out for here? 

00:17:40
FRANK WILLS Well, as I’m asking her to give an account of her history, it culminates in me asking her, what core believes seem to come out of that experience and history? And admittedly Jan does give a very clear answer to that. 

00:17:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:17:55
FRANK WILLS But actually, I found that clients in general can often tell you quite easily what their core beliefs are. What seems to link the present problem with the history is the belief that people are not really listening to me. 

00:18:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so let’s look at that now. 

00:18:15
FRANK WILLS Okay! Okay, what umm… 

00:18:15
Excerpt 2 (from Session 1) 

00:18:15
FRANK WILLS What’s about your mum and dad? How did they fit into this? 

00:18:20
JAN GRAY Well that’s interesting actually. My sister, she had won a to a school so she was obviously clever. And my brother failed his all levels, reset them. You now he was a… And so he got lots and lots and lots of encouragement from my parents. 

00:18:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:45
JAN GRAY Umm… To in… You know to… You know, they… they’d praise him a lot of the time. 

00:18:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! 

00:18:50
JAN GRAY And they with me, when I came to… Because my sister had gone to girls grammar and my brother had gone to the boys grammar. And my sister had been really unhappy at the girls school. I had gone to the co-ed. So, you know I went there not from choice it was because my sister, you know didn’t like that one. So… But the assumption was that I was alright. You know I would, you know Jan doesn’t need our encouragement, because she, you know she’ll do alright. 

00:19:30
FRANK WILLS Didn’t quite get that point, but your sister didn’t like that one? 

00:19:30
JAN GRAY No, she didn’t like that school. 

00:19:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:19:30
JAN GRAY She wasn’t happy at that school. 

00:19:35
FRANK WILLS I see! So, she was transferred to… 

00:19:35
JAN GRAY So she… No she finished that school. 

00:19:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah! 

00:19:40
JAN GRAY But then it was thought, because she was seven years older than me, by the time I, you know she had already left, that her experience of going to the girls grammar was so negative that my parents you know said no we’re not sending you there. 

00:19:50
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:19:55
JAN GRAY So I went to a co-ed school. 

00:19:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah! I mean, how did get on with your mum and dad in that? 

00:20:00
JAN GRAY Now alright, at the time not… not… not particularly… It has taken me to my 40s actually. 

00:20:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah! I don’t know if this is right or not, but I got a slight sense of them having to deal with all this stuff with your brother and sister, and then when you came along they kind of run out of energy or something? 

00:20:20
JAN GRAY Well they did. 

00:20:20
FRANK WILLS You were expected to run yourself? 

00:20:25
JAN GRAY It… Do you know… That’s absolutely, yes. I’m good… Because my sister had problems in her teenage, so they were very you know, the lot of focus on my sister. And my brother, because… Actually I think this is because he had an accident when he was… when he was a little boy, and he had fractured his skull. And he had a long time in hospital. 

00:20:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:20:45
JAN GRAY And so he was also very carefully treated. 

00:20:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:50
JAN GRAY And I think, yes. By the time they got me they had run out of energy. 

00:20:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! 

00:20:55
JAN GRAY Run out of steam. 

00:20:55
FRANK WILLS And that they were quite a bit older by that point as well? 

00:21:00
JAN GRAY That was right, yeah. So, it was, you know I was… 

00:21:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, bit unfair? 

00:21:05
JAN GRAY Yes, yes. 

00:21:05
FRANK WILLS A lot unfair maybe? I think… I don’t… 

00:21:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, I think it was. I think it was. I think it was. I don’t think how got a lot of positive acknowledgement. 

00:21:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:21:15
JAN GRAY You know that there was lot of assumptions made about me achieving. But no acknowledge how hard it, I had to try. 

00:21:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! And Umm… I’m just kind of thinking that Umm… So if we kind of put that together then, you know that umm… in some ways in the… in the sibling grew was quite competitive by the sound of it? 

00:21:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, still is. 

00:21:45
FRANK WILLS And you were at the bottom of the hierarchy, and the age and… 

00:21:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:21:50
FRANK WILLS …in your perception at least in some other attributes as well? 

00:21:50
JAN GRAY Yeah! Still is. Still is. 

00:21:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! And somehow rather umm… although your mum and dad you know you wouldn’t… you wouldn’t say they were bad parents. I don’t think reading between the lines a bit, but some how they kind of neglected to give you some things that perhaps they could have given you and? 

00:22:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:22:15
FRANK WILLS And you were a kind of expected to run yourself? 

00:22:20
JAN GRAY Well it was… It was actually… I mean, it was implicit in childhood, but now my parents are a bit older, they’ve made it explicit, that… that my mum and my brother, you know my brother was my mum’s favorite and my sister was daddy’s girl. And I… you know and… and what about me, you know. 

00:22:40
FRANK WILLS You kind of nobodies favorite? 

00:22:40
JAN GRAY That’s right. And… And you know that’s something that you know… 

00:22:45
FRANK WILLS Still is there. 

00:22:45
JAN GRAY Umm… Lesser now, but… but to an extent, to an extent. 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS You know in cognitive therapy more things we look at is you know what… how people develop core beliefs about of life, you know about themselves and about other people. Coming out with these experiences would you, can you (inaudible )? 

00:23:11
JAN GRAY Oh yeah! Yeah, well I’m not loveable. 

00:23:11
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:23:15
JAN GRAY And I’m not good enough. 

00:23:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… And other people? 

00:23:20
JAN GRAY Are better than me. 

00:23:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… And… And what’s about, are other people helpful? 

00:23:25
JAN GRAY No. 

00:23:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah! That’s kind of… 

00:23:30
JAN GRAY Oh that was really. 

00:23:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! I can see your feeling. 

00:23:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:23:35
FRANK WILLS There’s some stuff here, (inaudible ) to stay with this. 

00:23:38
JAN GRAY Yeah! Yeah, I mean, that’s, you know that’s… 

00:23:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:40
JAN GRAY I’ve never thought of that, but that’s… that’s true yes. Because one of my sort of, sort of rules I had set myself is it, you know I don’t expect anybody to do anything for me, I have to do it myself. 

00:23:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… And I wonder if that does come up you know when you with the crowd of people you know that’s in a way you don’t really expect anyone to feel sympathetic towards you? 

00:24:05
JAN GRAY Well, no quite the opposite. Actually, I expect them to be antagonistic. Yeah, I expect them not to like me. 

00:24:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! And you know looking back at that, you know one of the brilliant things about children is that they, you know how… I mean, that’s a quite a good way of dealing with that kind of situation to believe those things because it was essentially true. You know that other people aren’t helping me much here. 

00:24:35
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:24:35
FRANK WILLS Other people are being, you know thinking themselves better than me. 

00:24:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:24:40
FRANK WILLS It did actually make sense? 

00:24:40
JAN GRAY Yeah absolutely! 

00:24:40
FRANK WILLS You know, but I guess one of the problems is that this sometimes those beliefs stick around to a later points in life when maybe they are not quite so useful and accurate anymore. 

00:24:55
JAN GRAY Well yes I can understand. I can see how that would happen, yeah. 

00:25:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… I mean, what we… One thing we could do here is and I… I’m sorry if this sounds a bit (inaudible ), but hopefully over time it will make a bit more sensible. We could draw all this together now, because in a sense what… what we… we got the beginnings of something we would call a conceptualization, you know that we have here the, you know what happens now when you are in a situation… 

00:25:30
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:25:30
FRANK WILLS …were, you know people don’t seem to be paying attention to you and that kind of gets you. But we're also learning a bit about your history and core beliefs, which kind of feed into that. And… So that the importance of that is that… I mean, if you perhaps had a different history where people were always very interested in what you have to say, then a few people looking out of the window might make… 

00:26:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:26:05
FRANK WILLS …no difference one way or the other you know. And equally you know if even with this history where people were seemed to have not be not be very interested in what you have to say. You know if people are vaguely paying attention and then that could be okay too, you know. But it’s the two things kind of… 

00:26:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, I can see by the… 

00:26:25
FRANK WILLS …come together which really load up the emotional charge of this. And of course the stronger the emotion is the more it does push you into this kind of frightened, almost a frightened rabbit in the headlights kind of so where you… you know you’re… you’re very fixed on, you know the anxiety of it all and… and you also having images probably of people looking very bored. And… So… But… But you know that the… So… What I can do with this you know before you go I sort of give you a copy of what I’ve written down here. 

00:27:05
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:27:05
FRANK WILLS And we can both sort of tinker around with it before we meet up next time and see, just try and make a map with this problem how it was. And we can have a look at that in the next time we… we… we come. 

00:27:20
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:27:20
MIKE SIMMONS Obviously assessment is a much longer process than we shown here, but we’ve looked at the key features. 

00:27:30
FRANK WILLS Yes that obviously would be a full assessment and then the detail that came from the assessment will be fitted into a formulation. And there’re some comments on both those factors in the booklet. 

00:27:45
MIKE SIMMONS And now we’re going to start looking at the interventions you made based on that assessment. 

00:27:50
FRANK WILLS Yes and it is really important to stress that the interventions are quite tightly targeted on the goals that come out of the assessment and the formulation. 

00:28:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay! And what where those interventions that you made? 

00:28:00
FRANK WILLS Well in the work with Jan, what we’re going to see is first of all some behavioral work that we did in session 2. And then later on some cognitive work that we did in session 3. The behavioral work really began at the end of session 1 actually, where we set a homework task for Jan to watch the tape of the session. And the… On one level this was a nice simple task, but we also knew that it was one that was light to bring up material, stuff for Jan, because of the visibility and the performance elements of looking yourself on a tape. 

00:28:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah! 

00:28:45
FRANK WILLS I think it’s particularly good for us to watch it now, because it does show a kind of developing trend in CBT towards thinking more about the interpersonal dimension. And in this session I certainly used the skill of immediacy to kind of check out what was going on between her and me, you know how she was seeing, how I saw her etc. 

00:29:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:29:10
FRANK WILLS And this is a developing tread in CBT. And I think it’s nice, because it shows that we’ve been willing to be open and to learn from other therapy models. And it is something I’ve been writing, thinking about a lot recently. And you will be surprised to know that’s… 

00:29:25
MIKE SIMMONS In the booklet? 

00:29:25
FRANK WILLS There is some material for the references in the book as well. 

00:29:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. I mean, the several things here, because that idea of the interpersonal in CBT sounds kind of something that will surprise a lot of people. And much of what you’ve been talking about to me as a non-CBT therapist sounds particularly interesting. So, well let’s have a look. 

00:29:50
FRANK WILLS Okay! I would guess there have been been some negative… 

00:29:50
Excerpt 3 (from Session 2) 

00:29:55
FRANK WILLS …thoughts going through your mind about that? 

00:29:55
JAN GRAY Well, yes because I, a) my initial thought was I felt silly having to talk to somebody about this. 

00:30:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:05
JAN GRAY And I… I felt also that I’d look silly and of course I did, so it confirmed that one. And, also there was a part of me that… Actually, there was a part of me that thought, well, I didn’t believe it’s gonna help anyway. 

00:30:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… And you felt a bit pessimistic or? 

00:30:30
JAN GRAY A little bit. 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:30:30
JAN GRAY A Little bit. 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS I mean, sometimes that can be umm… a sort of protection about working, against working of your hopes too much maybe. 

00:30:45
JAN GRAY Well, yes and I think you said on the… on the video and that was the thing that you know that really I remembered most of all from the first we met was that I actually don’t think I believe people can help me. 

00:31:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:00
JAN GRAY And if I'm honest, there is a part me that also thinks that here. 

00:31:05
FRANK WILLS Oh yeah! Okay, alright. So that’s… that’s something we’ll try and keep on this so all this we… we go along. I guess that all we can say I would just kind of say at the movement, let’s give it a go and see what happens. 

00:31:25
JAN GRAY Okay, okay! I felt really hard to say that. 

00:31:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Yeah, I really appreciate you saying it actually, because it’s very important though what you say to, you know you’re on to something. I got the feeling actually of watching the tape myself that you know that you’re a person who does value on honesty, pretty strongly actually. 

00:31:45
JAN GRAY Umm… Yeah, suppose I do really. I suppose I do. I suppose… But added to that there is a part me that doesn’t, when people… I suppose that part of me that doesn’t believe that people are being honest with me when they nice things. 

00:32:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:05
JAN GRAY But, yes I do value honesty. 

00:32:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah! So I kind of paid you bit of a complement that by saying, I valid your honesty. 

00:32:15
JAN GRAY Yeah! And I feel I’m actually know I feel I’m blushing out. 

00:32:15
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright. 

00:32:20
JAN GRAY So if I… I feel bit embarrassed about that. 

00:32:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Yeah, yeah! And… And the embarrassing thought is it would? 

00:32:25
JAN GRAY Is being nice to me. 

00:32:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:32:30
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Is that… Is that some suspicion about when people are nice to you sometimes? 

00:32:40
JAN GRAY Umm… I suppose it’s not expected. I suppose, I sort of expect. I expect that, you actually think I’m being silly by even worrying about how you… how you’re seeing me and the fact that you being nice to me. So, yeah it is a surprise. 

00:33:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… And so… And that seems to tie up a little bit with that other negative thought you had about, you know it’s silly needing to talk to somebody like this kind of thing? 

00:33:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah! Because I should know better. I should know how to sort this out myself. I should be able to cope on my own. I should need help. 

00:33:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Well, what’s the argument on the other side to that one? 

00:33:30
JAN GRAY Who is that one? And… 

00:33:35
FRANK WILLS I mean, do you… Do you think people who seek this kind of help are weak or something like that or? Is there another side to it? 

00:33:45
JAN GRAY Umm… Well no, I don’t actually! I mean I have known some people that have… that had some you know sort of therapy. And umm… I think they were really brave to do it, because it meant them going to some sort of painful places emotionally. But, I suppose as you said it, there was… I could almost hear umm… sort of a voice saying, oh you know you’re making a fuss about nothing. 

00:34:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… So there is kind of a double standards that you know, you don’t give yourself the leeway that you would give other people? 

00:34:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose… I suppose you’re right, yeah, yeah. Yes. 

00:34:30
FRANK WILLS I mean, I wonder what it would be to like to be a bit kind of this sort? 

00:34:30
JAN GRAY Umm… Oh! Ah… Well it would… it would probably mean I sleep better at night. For a… For a start, because it would mean I could let things rest. 

00:34:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:34:50
JAN GRAY And you talked last time about like the postmortem that I do and I guess part of doing that postmortem is actually sort of, I was chastising myself the things I did wrong. 

00:35:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:35:05
JAN GRAY So if I was kind to myself I wouldn’t do that and I’d possibly sleep better. 

00:35:10
FRANK WILLS So… So let’s just know for the moment that you know… What… What I think we might find is that you know interesting thoughts like this come up you know, there is perhaps double standards here you know, and but we can just umm… let that thoughts be there, so that we don’t have to pursue it. We don’t have to pursue every… 

00:35:30
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:35:30
FRANK WILLS …thing you know. If… If it’s a value it will come back in to umm… our meetings things and we’ll… 

00:35:35
JAN GRAY Right! So there might be other double standards I got for example. So… 

00:35:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Well that… No, that wasn’t really what I was meaning. I was meaning that you know we could now have a big discussion about double standards and things like that but… but sometimes it’s just better just to note… 

00:35:50
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:35:50
FRANK WILLS …something and… and just let it come back if it wants to… 

00:35:55
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:35:55
FRANK WILLS …into… into things. It sounded like you got a bit self-critical there though, I guess? 

00:36:00
JAN GRAY Alright. 

00:36:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, was it alright? 

00:36:05
JAN GRAY Well, I suppose what I was thinking was perhaps there are things that you know where I’m actually being tougher on myself then I have… 

00:36:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:36:10
JAN GRAY …been with other people. 

00:36:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah…. 

00:36:15
JAN GRAY That I probably haven’t been aware of. 

00:36:15
FRANK WILLS But my… my guess would be is that you probably quite empathic about other people? 

00:36:20
JAN GRAY (Inaudible ) my job really I suppose… 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:36:25
JAN GRAY I mean although it’s selling you know there is… there is an element of needing to have an understanding of what your clients are wanting. 

00:36:30
FRANK WILLS So it might be interesting to see whether we could extend that empathy a bit more to yourself and just that might be helpful. 

00:36:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah! 

00:36:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah! Okay! So umm… A bit… I just wanted to pick that up you that umm… You know it… it would be a shame if this kind of thing about sometimes thinking was a bit silly to come here, whether that you know cuts across the… the work that we were doing? It has a potential to do that, doesn’t it? It has a potential to… 

00:37:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:37:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:37:10
JAN GRAY Yes, I suppose that there is a part of me thinking the more I tell you about myself the more umm… you see how actually how I’m not functioning particularly well, the less likely I am to come. 

00:37:25
FRANK WILLS And just… just one other thing that I so heard you saying about… about watching the video you know you… you said I couldn’t remember exactly the way you just put it that but it was along the lines you thought you wouldn’t look very good and… 

00:37:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:37:45
FRANK WILLS …and sure enough when you watched it? 

00:37:45
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:37:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah! And what I’m… 

00:37:50
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:37:50
FRANK WILLS So you had someone else though with you. Did… Did your husband agree with you on that? 

00:37:55
JAN GRAY Yeah but he is biased, isn’t he? 

00:37:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:38:00
JAN GRAY I mean, he would… he would… he would think I looked okay. He would say the right things. I suppose… I suppose what I’m saying is I wouldn’t believe him anyway, if he said I look good. 

00:38:10
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright! 

00:38:10
JAN GRAY You know he… he ah… I wouldn’t believe him. 

00:38:15
FRANK WILLS So what kind of standards come into play there when you’re trying to judge whether you think you look okay or? 

00:38:25
JAN GRAY Umm… That’s a good question! 

00:38:30
[sil.] 

00:38:35
JAN GRAY I suppose it was not looking silly. Umm… Not… Actually not… not looking silly. I don’t think I look too silly. I think sometimes I sounded silly. 

00:38:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Alright! 

00:38:45
JAN GRAY I think I sounded a bit winge. 

00:38:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm… And is… is that to do with your voice then? 

00:38:50
JAN GRAY I think so. And I think… I think actually as I watched the video I was watching your reaction to me as well. And… And I think if you'd have reacted you know, if you’d have given an expression possibly which actually you didn’t, but I think that might have really confirmed that, you know that I was, you know, wasting your time being silly and you thought I was, you know, stupid but you didn’t. So umm… 

00:39:30
FRANK WILLS I mean, it’s hard… it’s hard isn’t it? This thing about feedback and… and because we all need feedback? 

00:39:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:39:40
FRANK WILLS And we also need to believe in that? 

00:39:40
JAN GRAY That’s right. 

00:39:40
FRANK WILLS In the feedback? 

00:39:40
JAN GRAY That’s right. 

00:39:45
FRANK WILLS So, I mean, may be that will come into our work as well, you know that… I mean, what I would want to do is to give you a honest feedback, because I… 

00:39:50
JAN GRAY Yeah and I suppose there is a part of me… there is a part of me wants to be believe that. 

00:39:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:39:55
JAN GRAY That you know wants to believe that when you say something that that’s… that’s you know how it is that you’re not saying it just to be nice. 

00:40:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Okay, well, umm… Let’s conclude that then by saying this I mean, I also watched the tape and I didn’t think you sounded winge or silly or I thought you looked fine. 

00:40:20
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:40:20
FRANK WILLS (Crosstalk)(Inaudible) …the way you look at all. 

00:40:25
JAN GRAY Alright, okay. 

00:40:25
FRANK WILLS It’s because I am a therapist and… 

00:40:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, and you are nice. Yeah! 

00:40:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… But I am also committed to trying to be honest with you. 

00:40:35
JAN GRAY Yeah! And… and I believe you. 

00:40:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, okay. And you also umm… I kind of can’t quite remember the exact remark you made, but you said you know a voice came in and… 

00:40:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:40:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and… and any… Did that voice have any particular quality or? 

00:40:50
JAN GRAY Well it was very, very critical. 

00:40:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:40:55
JAN GRAY Umm… And if I am wholly honest, it reminds me of my mum, umm… really. 

00:41:05
FRANK WILLS So your mum kind of sits on your shoulder sometimes? 

00:41:10
JAN GRAY A lot. 

00:41:10
FRANK WILLS Alright. 

00:41:10
JAN GRAY Yeah! A lot in… in situations like that. In situations where there’s a lot expected from me. Yeah! 

00:41:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Is she there now to? 

00:41:25
JAN GRAY Umm… Well there is a part… there is a part of it. Actually, saying for goodness sake put yourself together. You don’t need to be here. You know, don’t be so self-indulgent, so yes. 

00:41:35
FRANK WILLS I mean, do you… Do you want to turn to her and just say? 

00:41:40
JAN GRAY No I don’t. 

00:41:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah! You can’t? You can tell! 

00:41:45
JAN GRAY What do I say to her? I suppose… 

00:41:50
FRANK WILLS What would you like to say to her? 

00:41:50
JAN GRAY Well I… I’ll actually like… I actually like to tell her to buzz off. 

00:41:55
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… We’re kind of busy at the moment, yeah. 

00:42:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah! We are, we’re busy. We’re working. I bet your crosswords. 

00:42:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, she will? 

00:42:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:42:10
FRANK WILLS Okay, good, yeah! 

00:42:15
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so a lot of that hangs up was really about the relationship it felt to me. And I think if I’d have just come in and watch that tape, I wouldn’t have immediately identified it as being CBT. 

00:42:25
FRANK WILLS Okay, well, first of all I’m quite pleased to confuse your categories a bit. Umm… But secondly, I would relate this back to the formulation, which again people can look at. You know we actually wrote it down and put it in the booklet. But you will see that in the formulation as… as indeed is for the formulation for the most clients, the key issues and the key beliefs and thoughts are nearly always interpersonal. 

00:42:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:42:55
FRANK WILLS So, I think that in addressing them in what ever way, we are focusing our intervention on the… the formulation. And that’s what would probably distinguish a CBT version of interpersonal work… 

00:43:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:43:10
FRANK WILLS …from others perhaps. 

00:43:10
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, that’s really interesting. So what's next? 

00:43:10
FRANK WILLS In… In the next extract we’re kind of exploring how Jan might experiment with changing her behavior. In a way this took advantage of a particular thing that had happened between the sessions. Umm… What had happened was that she’d had a sort of umm… sort of annual appraisal at work and she had expected that it would be with her manager, i.e. one person. 

00:43:40
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:43:45
FRANK WILLS And it turned out to that it was actually with two people, because her manager was being replaced by another one. And that when she walked into the room and saw this she felt very panic and she kind of froze. And so what we’re talking about here is, umm… how could you… how could she move out of being frozen and move into being more proactive in her behavior? 

00:44:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right! So what point would be looking out for here? 

00:44:10
FRANK WILLS What I was trying to do here was to actually get to… get Jan to rehearse another type of response with me. As a matter of fact she never quite does that. But umm… in my opinion what happens is that she rehearses that different behavior in her imagination. 

00:44:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right, yeah! 

00:44:25
FRANK WILLS And that seems to shift and move things. As a matter of fact there is quite an interesting debate within CBT and may be some other therapies too about exposure therapy and about whether it’s best umm… imagining a situation that you are fearful of umm… or actually going and doing it live in a real situation. Matter of fact, it seems to work quite well in both. 

00:44:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right, okay! 

00:44:55
FRANK WILLS So, we can keep that in mind as we watch this. 

00:44:55
MIKE SIMMONS Right, let’s have a look. 

00:44:55
Excerpt 4(from Session 2) 

00:44:55
JAN GRAY Oh I hadn’t realized that. 

00:45:00
FRANK WILLS That kind of took you by surprise? 

00:45:00
JAN GRAY It did, it did rather 

00:45:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:45:00
JAN GRAY It rather felt as if I was a naughty school girl getting, called in front of you know the headmasters, you know sort of account for umm… you know what I’ve been doing. Umm… 

00:45:15
FRANK WILLS Did… Did that sort of thing come to in school though? 

00:45:20
JAN GRAY Only once. 

00:45:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:45:25
JAN GRAY Yeah only once. And it was you know it… That’s how it felt. I felt I had been naughty. 

00:45:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Okay. Just coming back to this situation, did they offer you any irrational for, you know while there were two of them there? 

00:45:40
JAN GRAY While rather than that there had been an overlap, you know, from… from my job, from moving from one sort of role to another. That umm… That you for that part of a part of the time one of them had been my reporting manager and the other part had been the other. But other than that no, so… so I suppose there is a part of me left wondering you know what I’ve done wrong and… 

00:46:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:46:05
JAN GRAY You know, why really? 

00:46:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah! So… I mean, did… did… Does the rational make any sense to you? 

00:46:15
JAN GRAY Well on one level it does. 

00:46:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:46:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, in one level it does. I suppose I’m not aware of it being like that for anybody else in the… in the organization. So it rather felt like it was me that they were picking on. 

00:46:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… I wonder if you could find out about that actually? 

00:46:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, I could. 

00:46:35
FRANK WILLS I mean, would it be different if it turns out that it was the usual policy? Would that be different? 

00:46:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. I… I don’t know why I didn’t think to do that actually, but yes it might help. 

00:46:45
FRANK WILLS It sounds like you were bit kind of thrown and wrong footed to begin with, as it were, you know, something happened you weren’t expecting. 

00:46:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:46:50
FRANK WILLS Kind of put you on the back foot of it? 

00:46:55
JAN GRAY It… It was. It was umm… I really felt I was having, really having to perform, but normally if it’s a one-to-one. I mean, it’s like me talking to you now you know… you know… I… I… it’s only you’ve gotto perform. You know, I… I can concentrate in you and it was the other person there as well. It really… I really felt I had to watch my back you know that… that they were out for me actually. 

00:47:20
FRANK WILLS And… I mean, you know last time we talked about this umm… kind of core belief that comes up for you sometimes that you know people aren’t really gonna help me. I mean, do you think this gonna a bit activated? 

00:47:35
JAN GRAY You are not… Well, yes. I mean, you are not get kidding. I mean… Yeah, I mean, there wasn’t even good cop bad cop type of thing. You know they… that’s… well that’s how I felt anyway. It really felt umm… that they were looking for faults rather than looking for… for things I had done well. 

00:47:55
FRANK WILLS And it… it’s quite an… an interesting expression you… you used there, you know, this is how it felt. 

00:48:00
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:48:00
FRANK WILLS Umm… And… And… You know and sometimes you know we rely our emotions to read a situation. 

00:48:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:48:10
FRANK WILLS And sometimes those emotions you know don’t line up with a more sort of head. You know the interpretation of what was going on. 

00:48:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, I… I can see that. I can see that, if I had been able to stop and think a little bit more rationally, but that’s what happened. I just walked in and roared they there and I could feel you know my heart was you know racing. And I could feel all the… the similar sort of symptoms I get when I… when I stand up and do a… a presentation. So, I was having to concentrate on trying to reduce those and not look stupid in front of them. Which actually made things worse really. 

00:49:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:49:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:49:00
FRANK WILLS I wonder you can just umm… bring up the… the image bit here, just… just briefly. Can you just get back to the situation of the three of you sitting together. You know you just literally sat down. 

00:49:20
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:49:20
FRANK WILLS And you all sort of inside your mind is racing this thing about why are the two of them? And… And in this scenario we’re going umm… we’re going to feed you a line to say. 

00:49:35
JAN GRAY Right. 

00:49:35
FRANK WILLS And… And this is like a you know sort of play for the day. 

00:49:40
JAN GRAY Okay. 

00:49:40
FRANK WILLS On the television. You know we can… we can sort of… we can make anything happen here. And in this umm… scene you say umm… I wonder if you could just tell me is it the usual policy to have a previous manager in with the present manager for this first appraisal situation? 

00:50:05
JAN GRAY Yeah! Why didn’t I think of saying that! You want me to say that now? 

00:50:10
FRANK WILLS Do… Do you… Well, do you want to say it? 

00:50:10
JAN GRAY Well I… I wonder why I didn’t think of saying that! That would have been so much better, wouldn’t it? Because then I wouldn’t be left wondering now. 

00:50:25
FRANK WILLS I'm bit worried now, because it’s kind of produced a self-criticism in you. I was only just… I mean, it’s very difficult to speak out especially, you know to question managers. 

00:50:35
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:50:35
FRANK WILLS You probably have to be a fairly accretive person to do it. 

00:50:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:50:40
FRANK WILLS And… And you weren’t in accretive mood, because as we said you know you were on your back foot. 

00:50:45
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS But, I’m just interested you know and just imagining what it would have you know, what it would have been like to have said that? 

00:50:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:51:00
FRANK WILLS Would it change the… the feeling for you? 

00:51:05
JAN GRAY I think it would have done actually. 

00:51:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:51:05
JAN GRAY I think it would… I was… I was just… I was just sort of imagining how it would be to say that to them. Would they have been angry with me and I don’t think they would. 

00:51:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah! It’s kind of legitimate question seems to? Yeah! 

00:51:15
JAN GRAY Yeah! Yeah, it wasn’t… 

00:51:20
FRANK WILLS And you… you weren’t asking it impolitely? 

00:51:20
JAN GRAY No, no! I think it would have possibly also given me some breathing space, some time you know whilst they were answering it for me to then you know calm myself down a bit. Yeah. 

00:51:35
FRANK WILLS I mean, can… can you imagine any of your other colleagues who might have said something like that? 

00:51:45
JAN GRAY Yes, yes, I can. Yes. 

00:51:50
FRANK WILLS Like who? 

00:51:55
JAN GRAY There is well, Sheila for one, she would have… she would have said… said that you know. 

00:52:00
FRANK WILLS Is she quite accretive? 

00:52:05
JAN GRAY She is fairly accretive, yes. Yes, bit scary actually. But, yeah, she would have said it. 

00:52:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:52:10
JAN GRAY And… 

00:52:10
FRANK WILLS And it… it may be not a thing that many people would have done? 

00:52:20
JAN GRAY No, that’s right. It probably would be quite a hard thing to say unless you felt really quite confident, yeah. 

00:52:25
FRANK WILLS But, I mean, that’s may be something we can come back to, because we’re talking about that is you know assertiveness. And you probably had the expression assertiveness skills have you? 

00:52:35
JAN GRAY I have. 

00:52:35
FRANK WILLS And you know those groups and things you can do? 

00:52:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:52:40
FRANK WILLS And so we can do a little bit of it in one-to-one work as well. In other words, it’s something you can learn. 

00:52:50
JAN GRAY Right, right, yeah! 

00:52:50
FRANK WILLS You know, so learn about skill or at least some people think it is. You know so, I mean, to try and humanize that bit though is it kind of like might it would be helpful sometimes to be a bit more like Sheila? 

00:53:05
JAN GRAY Well, yeah! I can imagine yes because I mean Sheila does a very similar job to me and I can imagine that she, well I've seen her in action and she is certainly doesn’t appear to have the same nerves around doing presentations to… to groups as I do. And she is certainly seems to not worry quite so much. 

00:53:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm… 

00:53:30
JAN GRAY Umm… Yes, so it will be great if I could be a bit more like that. 

00:53:35
FRANK WILLS I mean, I don’t also want, don’t want to make Sheila the… the good person and you not the good person. 

00:53:40
JAN GRAY Right! 

00:53:40
FRANK WILLS And you probably got… 

00:53:45
MIKE SIMMONS So we’re moving into the cognitive interventions here. What next? 

00:53:50
FRANK WILLS That’s right. Well, now we’re in session 3 and we’re using a thought record. A thought record is a well trained and trusted mechanism intervention that’s used in… in CBT. And I think it will be useful actually for viewers at this stage to compare the structure and layout of the thought record with our work in session 1 where we identified a vicious cycle… 

00:54:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:54:20
FRANK WILLS …of trigger thoughts, feelings and behavior. In a sense the thought record writes all this down. And writing it down is helpful, because it means it can be used in a cumulative way. It can be analyzed later and it can be some thing that a the client can actually use outside the therapy. As a matter of fact, I… I kept a thought record myself three months to making entries every single day just to get really used to how it would work. And I was amazed that some of the rubbish that was going on my… in… in my head. We are actually using some of the ideas of Christine Padesky in the way… 

00:54:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:54:55
FRANK WILLS …to use a thought records here. And as before we begin with a specific event and this turned out to be something that Jan reported about uncomfortable experience she had had at a dinner party. Incidentally, I’m not too sure how social anxieties do tend to generalize and become lot more and more prevalent in different areas of the client’s life. Although sometimes they can also be very specific. And what… what happened at the dinner party was that Jan became aware that… that it was a dinner party of four couples and the three women are from the three of the couples were planning to go out together actually to a weight watchers meeting. And Jan experienced umm… a sense of hurt about this. So by the time we… we joined the tape for our next extract we had already been working on this. And we filled in the first three columns of the thought record. The first column was the trigger situation and that was being with friends at the dinner party. 

00:56:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

00:56:05
FRANK WILLS But also the specific moments where they tripped to weight watches were discussed. Again… 

00:56:10
MIKE SIMMONS She was excluded from it. 

00:56:10
FRANK WILLS That’s right. And again the specific moment is important, because that’s the one that gets closest to the real life, emotional hurt feeling which is the that Jan put into column number two as the… the… the dominant emotion was hurt and she rated this 90%, i.e. 100% was the most hurt she could be. This is how hurt she felt in this situation. And then finally we tried to identify a key thought. And the one that came through was they don’t like me. So, what we are going to move to now is watching us work on columns four and five of the thought record, which is exploring the evidence for and against the fact that… 

00:57:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

00:57:00
FRANK WILLS …whether these people like Jan or not. 

00:57:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right! And what she would be looking out for? 

00:57:05
FRANK WILLS Well the thing… thing to notice here is that we consider the evidence supporting the negative belief first. And notice that as we do this the evidence at first seems very, very convincing. The rational of this is that it’s usually more convincing when you start to review the positive evidence, if you’ve had a good look at the worst case scenario first. 

00:57:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm… 

00:57:30
FRANK WILLS In this case, this process seems to work so that gradually the idea that they don’t like me shifts to a more moderate and probably more accurate belief, well they probably do like me but they just don’t think I wanted to go to weight watchers. 

00:57:45
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, so let’s lookout for that. 

00:57:50
Excerpt 5 (from Session 3) 

00:57:50
FRANK WILLS So the next little bit you know columns four or five is we use those to kind of review the evidence because they are on the… they are sort of like an opinion if you like. Aren’t they that they didn’t like there… there are hypothesis if you like. 

00:58:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:58:05
FRANK WILLS You know rather than the fact. Umm… So let… let’s take the first one, they don’t like you. 

00:58:10
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:58:10
FRANK WILLS They don’t like me, umm… and we also look at the evidence that could support the… the negative ideas to begin with. 

00:58:20
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

00:58:20
FRANK WILLS Umm… So… So what evidence is there that? 

00:58:25
JAN GRAY Well I know that they… they’ve met ah… when we’ve been invited on the six of them met or the four of them have met when haven’t been invited. 

00:58:35
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

00:58:35
JAN GRAY So. 

00:58:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. They had met without me before. 

00:58:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:58:45
[sil.] 

00:58:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. And I only have ah…ah… And… Actually, they never ever phoned me. 

00:59:00
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:59:00
JAN GRAY Or you know come and have another cup of coffee or any in that. Should I write that one down? 

00:59:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:59:10
[sil.] 

00:59:25
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

00:59:25
FRANK WILLS Anything else? 

00:59:25
JAN GRAY Well, in fact they’re going to weight watchers to help me? 

00:59:35
FRANK WILLS How is your feeling as you’re writing these things down? 

00:59:40
JAN GRAY Well, I’m actually feeling that it… it must be true. 

00:59:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… That’s okay. Is there anything else that before we… 

00:59:55
JAN GRAY Umm… 

00:59:55
FRANK WILLS advance to the next column? 

01:00:00
[sil.] 

01:00:05
JAN GRAY Yeah, because they never ask me about what I am doing you know… 

01:00:10
FRANK WILLS When the dinner party is in running? 

01:00:10
JAN GRAY Yeah never… Never sort of start a conversation with me. 

01:00:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:00:20
[sil.] 

01:00:25
JAN GRAY There is something else here as well actually, they never… it sounds really silly, but… but when they go greet each other, they… they do mma… mma… I never get that. 

01:00:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… you don’t get kiss? 

01:00:35
JAN GRAY No. 

01:00:40
FRANK WILLS Umm… Okay. Now actually before we sort of move on further that column 1, one little chip here, which is good with these total records is that umm… you know, it’s always useful having a second look when you write never anywhere. 

01:01:00
JAN GRAY Right. 

01:01:00
FRANK WILLS And it’s also very worthwhile having a look at always, because one minus will phrase about this is never an awful long time for nothing, something not to happen and always as an awful long time the things happen now. Can you just look at over those again? I mean are they literally true to… you know or they’ve never… 

01:01:20
JAN GRAY Well, okay. 

01:01:20
FRANK WILLS …done those things? 

01:01:20
JAN GRAY I mean Linda used to come and have coffee with me and she… 

01:01:25
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:01:25
JAN GRAY …she doesn’t anymore. 

01:01:25
FRANK WILLS Right, right. 

01:01:30
JAN GRAY So… 

01:01:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:35
[sil.] 

01:01:40
FRANK WILLS And is there any particular reason for Linda’s change in that respect? 

01:01:45
JAN GRAY Well, I suppose… 

01:01:45
FRANK WILLS Actually we ought put that in the other column only because… 

01:01:50
JAN GRAY What the… 

01:01:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:50
JAN GRAY …the reason, well yes… 

01:01:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:01:50
JAN GRAY …because I suppose what’s happened is since I’ve started working… 

01:01:50
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:01:55
JAN GRAY …more… 

01:01:55
FRANK WILLS Right. 

01:01:55
JAN GRAY She probably… you know I’m probably not at home actually. 

01:02:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:02:00
JAN GRAY (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, I think so, yeah, I mean that is evidenced against the idea that it’s… it’s to do with not liking you. 

01:02:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:02:10
FRANK WILLS That’s been… been quite a change actually at work. 

01:02:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:02:15
FRANK WILLS And that’s reflected any of the other things? Do the other women work? 

01:02:20
JAN GRAY Umm… I suppose Sovia doesn’t work and Elaine… but Elaine does work, but Elaine doesn’t live locally, so… so, Sovia has never had come and had tea or coffee really. 

01:02:35
FRANK WILLS Another thing I want to stride is slightly skeptical motto if you don’t mind… you don’t mind me doing this to you. 

01:02:45
JAN GRAY No, no, not at all. 

01:02:45
FRANK WILLS Umm… is, umm… I’m curious how they never called you, how on earth did they get the invites to you if they don’t call you? 

01:02:55
JAN GRAY Yeah, okay. 

01:03:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Yeah. So that’s another matter, which is… 

01:03:05
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean we… we sometimes… 

01:03:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:03:05
JAN GRAY …rearrange the next one at the dinner party, so we come in that diaries, but… but yes. I have had… 

01:03:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah…Yeah. 

01:03:10
JAN GRAY Linda has phoned. Elaine tends to go through Linda who is her sister, so… yeah, okay. 

01:03:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so… so they do sometimes. 

01:03:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, they do sometimes phone. 

01:03:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Umm… Is that… Is that been changed at all by you being at work? 

01:03:30
JAN GRAY Well of course, yes. I mean they may phone and I’m not there. 

01:03:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:03:40
JAN GRAY Umm… and there are sometimes messages on the answer phone or… umm… 

01:03:45
FRANK WILLS Okay. And… and what about the kissing a bit? 

01:03:50
JAN GRAY Well, if I’m honest it’s probably because I probably don’t… 

01:03:55
FRANK WILLS (inaudible ). 

01:03:58
JAN GRAY No. 

01:04:00
FRANK WILLS No, yeah. 

01:04:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:04:00
FRANK WILLS So… so what? 

01:04:05
JAN GRAY Yes… 

01:04:05
FRANK WILLS I mean do… do you think they sort of realized that? 

01:04:05
JAN GRAY I guess I must give up that… 

01:04:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:04:10
JAN GRAY …so that probably this happens…). 

01:04:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, are they… on the other hand, are they very kissy people? You don’t want my invention… 

01:04:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:04:20
FRANK WILLS (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
JAN GRAY Only I suppose the one who does the most kissing I suppose Elaine. So it just tends to be Elaine that does the kissing. 

01:04:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. So they’re probably picking up that I’m not… you know, I’m not that way. 

01:04:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and you say probably what do you think… what’s the most lightly thing that... 

01:04:45
JAN GRAY Well they are I suppose because… 

01:04:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:04:45
JAN GRAY I do tend to when we… when they come to us, I do tend to stand behind the husband, so… 

01:04:55
FRANK WILLS Alright. So you make it a bit difficult one to do it 

01:04:55
JAN GRAY That’s what I do actually. 

01:04:55
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:05:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:05:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah and… and… you have the right to do that. You don’t have to be kissed, you know it’s not necessarily within a party. 

01:05:05
JAN GRAY No. 

01:05:10
FRANK WILLS No, So it’s alright not to be kissed. So… but I guess also it’s alright to be kissed as well I don’t know. 

01:05:15
JAN GRAY I suppose. Yeah, I suppose. I suppose not so much whether they kiss or don’t kiss me, is what they do that I’m not doing. 

01:05:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah… yeah… 

01:05:25
JAN GRAY That’s… that’s the bet. 

01:05:25
FRANK WILLS But… and actually in this case though there is a little bit of exclusion, but it’s not something that you’d be terribly keen on anyway? 

01:05:30
JAN GRAY No. That’s true actually. 

01:05:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. And I mean could it… could it be argued that they wish having some consideration for you by not imposing that on you? 

01:05:45
JAN GRAY No, I have never thought of it that way. 

01:05:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… But that’s what we’re doing as we‘re trying to think whether there are other ways of thinking that… 

01:05:55
JAN GRAY Yeah, I’ve never thought of it that way. 

01:05:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, okay. Well, let’s just pull that… pull that down as a… as a possibility of evidence again you know they may be taken into consideration and we’ll see what other evidence… 

01:06:05
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:06:05
FRANK WILLS …that doesn’t support the idea they don’t like you and see whether that chimes in with… 

01:06:15
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:06:15
FRANK WILLS …with us or not. But let’s go straight now. You know let’s go for the positive case now. Is there any evidence actually they do like you? 

01:06:25
JAN GRAY Umm… Well, we play cards with Mike and Sovia quite regularly. 

01:06:35
FRANK WILLS At least the immediate neighbors. 

01:06:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:06:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah…yeah… 

01:06:40
JAN GRAY So… 

01:06:40
FRANK WILLS Umm… it’s like okay or… 

01:06:45
JAN GRAY Yeah that’s… 

01:06:45
FRANK WILLS And it’s kind of easier when there’s not many other people around. 

01:06:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:06:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:06:50
JAN GRAY And… And… they send me birthday cards. 

01:06:55
FRANK WILLS Umm… And… And… And I’m gonna say guess it, but I guess you would like to want to better than six or… six or eight. You feel better in that situation. 

01:07:10
I SUPPOSE SO, I SUPPOSE SO.  

01:07:15
FRANK WILLS You don’t have to… It’s easier to have easy access to each other when you… 

01:07:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose… 

01:07:20
FRANK WILLS …like kind of more people are getting involved the more, the more… 

01:07:20
JAN GRAY Well, the more… 

01:07:25
FRANK WILLS …chances are that someone is gonna get left out a bit somewhere on the line. 

01:07:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

01:07:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and… and was… was there any… any reason you can think of why perhaps you might guess a little bit more left out than other people other than people not liking you. 

01:07:45
JAN GRAY Well, perhaps I don’t ask any questions of them. Perhaps I don’t start the conversations with them. 

01:07:55
FRANK WILLS You’re a little bit tensed to sometimes about coming forward perhaps something like that. It’s just the way should I come in to? 

01:08:05
JAN GRAY Umm… I… I… I suppose I can never necessarily think of the, you know, the right thing to start... 

01:08:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:08:15
JAN GRAY …with him. 

01:08:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and actually I mean people are very different on that. I mean I… this is I mean I feel a little bit myself actually. I sometimes feel when I’m in company with say eight people like this, you know, people have seen very quick and sometimes by the time I felt what I want to say, you know how conversation has moved on and it’s too late to say, you know… 

01:08:35
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:08:40
FRANK WILLS …you know that does kind of happen to you? 

01:08:40
JAN GRAY Well, yes, yeah. 

01:08:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:08:40
JAN GRAY I suppose it’s finding something that’s gonna be entertaining and amusing and interesting and... and funny… 

01:08:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:50
JAN GRAY And… 

01:08:50
FRANK WILLS So… there’s a bit of editorial control there you know you’re kind of thinking I’ve got… is this funny enough to say or is this… 

01:08:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:09:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah so… and but then in a fast-moving conversation, that’s going to… 

01:09:00
JAN GRAY Yeah and I’m wondering now, you know as we’re talking about, as we’re thinking about I’m wondering if… if what’s actually happened is… is I’ve possibly stopped trying quite hard and I’m wondering if I’ve sort of some… it’s something that I’ve done now… 

01:09:20
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:09:25
JAN GRAY …that’s not you know... 

01:09:25
FRANK WILLS It sounds like the fact that your working has had a big effect on it to me. 

01:09:30
JAN GRAY Right. 

01:09:30
FRANK WILLS Because when you are not around as much… 

01:09:30
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:09:35
FRANK WILLS …and we know that you’ve been worried and tired with work. 

01:09:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. Well that’s true and I suppose really with my job being so much… 

01:09:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:09:45
JAN GRAY … about talking and presenting… 

01:09:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:09:50
JAN GRAY …and performing and I’ve really felt… 

01:09:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:09:50
JAN GRAY …I have been struggling with that. I suppose what’s happened is I’ve actually stopped… 

01:09:55
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:09:55
JAN GRAY …trying quite hard because it is hard work for me. 

01:10:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. And… And you can’t quite just act naturally sort of thing. You know just say whatever comes into your head because you concerned, it's kind of some… 

01:10:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:10:10
FRANK WILLS …silly. Let… let’s remember when we were talking about umm… the appraisal. 

01:10:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:10:20
FRANK WILLS And umm… you know that you went in, you… you had the source, why they’re doing it in this way kind of thing and you… you didn’t give your sort of permission to… 

01:10:25
JAN GRAY …to ask. 

01:10:30
FRANK WILLS …to ask to go on the initiate… intiate… I mean let’s just imagine applying that principle to here umm… if you… you’re feeling a bit of tired and not gonna be fed up with work, umm… that was making you not participate quite as fully as maybe you would you know had before… 

01:10:50
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:10:50
FRANK WILLS …you felt like that. Is there anything you could say? 

01:10:55
JAN GRAY Well like ask them have they noticed a difference in me or something? 

01:10:55
FRANK WILLS Well, just make a statement about how you were, you know. 

01:11:00
JAN GRAY In other words, being busy or something. 

01:11:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so. 

01:11:05
JAN GRAY Oh well like… 

01:11:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, you tell me now as it follows. 

01:11:05
JAN GRAY Well, I’ve been really busy with work and… 

01:11:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:11:10
JAN GRAY …find works really tiring. 

01:11:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:11:15
JAN GRAY No energy left at the weekends. 

01:11:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so you it must be written what’s for you always tonight though? 

01:11:20
JAN GRAY Yes, so it’s nice to just sit and not have to talk. 

01:11:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, well you don’t have to, that’s fine you know we take as it comes to you. 

01:11:30
JAN GRAY Do you know… 

01:11:30
FRANK WILLS We will take you as you come. 

01:11:30
JAN GRAY I’ve actually said that. 

01:11:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah, Hmm…Hmm... 

01:11:35
JAN GRAY That actually feels very different. 

01:11:35
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:11:35
JAN GRAY Because if that is the case, then… 

01:11:35
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:11:40
JAN GRAY …then really they’re just quite happy for me to be then. I don’t have to… 

01:11:40
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:11:40
JAN GRAY …do anything, do I? They just... 

01:11:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Or they seem to keep inviting you? 

01:11:45
JAN GRAY That’s true. 

01:11:50
FRANK WILLS So that’s some evidence, isn’t it? 

01:11:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:11:50
FRANK WILLS Alright, you know, they keep inviting me. 

01:11:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:11:50
FRANK WILLS They haven’t struck you off the list… 

01:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Right. So you’re moving to an alternative shirt(ph) and she make an alternative shift of perception. 

01:12:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I do occasionally sharing shirts between sessions. 

01:12:05
MIKE SIMMONS It’s great to hear this. 

01:12:10
FRANK WILLS Umm… yes, on… on the next session now, umm… started to look at umm… deeper belief change, because while it’s true that umm… CBT does put a lots of umm… emphasis on work on working here and now with current problems is also maybe always necessary to look at the underlying or more historical umm… mechanisms that may underpin those umm… current problems. And indeed sometimes now, umm… we’ve been more likely to start off with working with the underlying mechanism core belief, schemas et cetera, in a… in a… in a sort of variance of CBT, which is called schema focus therapy. But in… in this case, the… the working with the current problem is actually going quite well as progress has been made. And I at this stage in… invite Jan whether she would like to review any of the historical links to things that happened previously in her life. There’s been a sense of that looking around… 

01:13:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right, right. 

01:13:15
FRANK WILLS …the old time(ph) we’ve been working in the more… more current problem area. And what I’m going to do in this next extract is to use a technique suggested by Christine Padesky called umm… the historical test or the schema. And what you do here is to identify schema or… or core belief. In this case, it was the one that… that we uncovered in one of the earlier extracts about Jan believing… believing this other people were not going to be helpful to her or as we stated in this case, no one will help me and we were examining this belief and how true it should be in the different points in her life and we’re particularly now our focusing on an incident that happened when Jan was in her mid-teens and on a school trip to Paris. 

01:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So what should we look out for now? 

01:14:15
FRANK WILLS Well again CBT is kind of known as quite an active instructed therapy. But I do personally myself believe that it’s possible to wear the structure quite lightly at times. 

01:14:25
MIKE SIMMONS Umm… 

01:14:30
FRANK WILLS And hereon exercising I think what…what is trying to be quite a light-handed approach. And the reason is because as we go into this childhood memory that comes up for Jan she is essentially processing that memory in quite a live emotional way. 

01:14:45
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:14:50
FRANK WILLS And I believe that once that’s happening, the therapist in the sense can only get in the way. So my job is to just listen very carefully, listen to maybe particularly salient points, so very much here, you know, standard counseling, good counseling skills I hope. 

01:15:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right, Yeah, yeah. 

01:15:05
FRANK WILLS And it’s interesting that when people are processing, memories do start to emerge and although this begins as a negative memory of being abandoned by her friends, umm… it does eventually surprisingly move to quite a positive memory in that there was one person who helped her… 

01:15:25
MIKE SIMMONS Right… 

01:15:25
FRANK WILLS …which is of course gold dust... 

01:15:25
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:15:30
FRANK WILLS …for her attempts to work with her belief that you know no one will help me. Umm… in fact throughout the session, we… we did this along the timeline and there was some other instances as well, which aren’t on the tape, but of course, they are in the… 

01:15:45
MIKE SIMMONS The booklet. 

01:15:45
FRANK WILLS …the booklet. And what seems to happen is that the belief that people won’t help me seems to shift towards something, which Jan eventually defines as there is no reason that makes me less worthy of helping another people. So that’s the… the shift has taken place. That might go further in time, but that’s quite a good start. And interestingly, Jan herself suggests wanting to write this new belief down. 

01:16:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:16:15
FRANK WILLS And that would cue into another one of Christine Padesky’s suggestions about work in the kind of schema area, something that she calls a positive data log, which is about, you know keeping a record actually of experiences, which would confirm your new belief. 

01:16:30
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:16:35
FRANK WILLS Because there is quite an interesting relationship between umm… trying to scale down negative beliefs, but also trying to build up positive beliefs… 

01:16:45
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah. 

01:16:45
FRANK WILLS …and the balance between those two things can change at different points in therapy. And of course there is a little more explanation of that in... 

01:16:55
MIKE SIMMONS This enormous booklet, okay. 

01:16:55
FRANK WILLS … (crosstalk) 

01:17:00
MIKE SIMMONS Good. Okay, right, let’s watch out for this. 

01:17:00
Excerpt 6 (from Session 4) 

01:17:00
JAN GRAY I mean the one incident that comes to mind where I really felt like nobody would help me, it was a school trip to France. 

01:17:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:17:10
JAN GRAY And it’s about 12, because it was the 1st year secondary school, so when I was 12. And we had been allowed to umm… we’ve been to the loo(ph) from where we’ve been allowed to go shopping and to you know I think one of the… one of the big stores then, and I had to meet it at a certain time with the teacher and that it was us, the four of us, and they ran off and left me in the… in the shop... 

01:17:35
FRANK WILLS Oh. 

01:17:40
JAN GRAY In Paris. 

01:17:40
FRANK WILLS Scary? 

01:17:45
JAN GRAY And yeah. 

01:17:45
FRANK WILLS How old were you? 

01:17:45
JAN GRAY About 12. 

01:17:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:17:50
JAN GRAY And actually you would have said to me to think about it. 

01:17:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:17:55
JAN GRAY And the French teacher’s husband actually noticed I wasn’t there. 

01:18:00
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:18:00
JAN GRAY And he came and found me. 

01:18:00
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:18:00
JAN GRAY And rest of the holiday, so I think that was… you know was a 10-week… 10 days holiday. 

01:18:05
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:18:05
JAN GRAY I had to spend with those three girls knowing that they’ve done that. 

01:18:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:18:15
JAN GRAY And… and that was… that was horrible actually. 

01:18:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah and we talked as an anger. 

01:18:20
JAN GRAY Well, yes that I couldn’t show it. 

01:18:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:18:25
JAN GRAY You know I had to pretend that I was too upset. 

01:18:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… So… so… I mean umm… what do you think about that now? 

01:18:35
JAN GRAY I think… 

01:18:35
FRANK WILLS What do you think? 

01:18:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, I think the teachers umm… not times have changed, but I think allowing four 12-year-old girls to walk around Paris… 

01:18:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:18:50
JAN GRAY …I think was quite negligent. 

01:18:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:18:55
JAN GRAY And I think they were really cruel to me, the girls. 

01:18:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:19:00
JAN GRAY And… and I think I was stupid because I didn’t have the courage to… 

01:19:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:19:05
JAN GRAY …to stick out for myself. 

01:19:05
FRANK WILLS Alright. So it sounds like a strange relationship you had with them… 

01:19:10
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:19:10
FRANK WILLS …because you’re saying… you said… you said the four of us. 

01:19:10
JAN GRAY Yes. 

01:19:15
FRANK WILLS Actually the three of them and me. 

01:19:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:19:15
FRANK WILLS So you were obvious there was something, which distinguishes the four of you from everyone else. 

01:19:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:19:20
FRANK WILLS But within that, there was another borderline as it were, another boundary. 

01:19:25
JAN GRAY Well, yes because I suppose really what happened I was with them, because everybody else in the class, I… I went to a co-ed and umm… the other girls as it were had all paired up. 

01:19:40
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:19:40
JAN GRAY And I mean it does sound really dwarf saying it but they were also girly girls and I wasn’t… 

01:19:45
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:19:45
JAN GRAY … a girly girl. You know I didn’t do ballet. I didn’t like horses. 

01:19:50
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:19:50
JAN GRAY I… So I didn’t fit in with the girly girls and I wasn’t like these girls really and… 

01:19:55
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:20:00
JAN GRAY Umm… I was…you know I was actually on my own really and…yeah, I don’t know why it’s been (inaudible ). 

01:20:11
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:20:11
JAN GRAY I don’t know why. 

01:20:11
FRANK WILLS But you don’t know why. 

01:20:11
JAN GRAY Why…why I would be like that? 

01:20:11
FRANK WILLS Why you change up with them? 

01:20:15
JAN GRAY Well, I don’t know why I was change up with them and I don’t why I wasn’t on my own, but I had that sense and I was actually pretty much my own person there… and there no matter. I think I used to try really hard to please them. 

01:20:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:20:25
JAN GRAY But actually deep down inside, I knew that, whatever I do. 

01:20:30
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm 

01:20:30
JAN GRAY They wouldn’t like me. 

01:20:30
FRANK WILLS Do they kind of use you a bit now? 

01:20:35
JAN GRAY Well, certainty for that French and English tests they did. 

01:20:40
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:20:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:20:40
FRANK WILLS And…and did…did do you ever have a… any clearing of the air discussion of that… 

01:20:45
JAN GRAY No. 

01:20:45
FRANK WILLS …that incident that you (crosstalk) 

01:20:50
JAN GRAY I wouldn’t have…wouldn’t have done it. 

01:20:50
FRANK WILLS Everyone just carried on as if it…it hadn’t. 

01:20:50
JAN GRAY Well, there’s lots of laughter behind you know that…you know that sniggering and laughing, you know I never got said. 

01:21:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:21:00
JAN GRAY And, if I hadn’t have been for the French teachers husband, you know I wonder what would have happened, if I had still been in Paris to this day. 

01:21:10
FRANK WILLS Right. Let’s just think about the French teacher’s husband, I mean tell me a bit about him? 

01:21:15
JAN GRAY Well, he was just, I mean he was just somebody as far as I needed X number of adults for X number of children and he was just somebody that came along with the French teacher. 

01:21:20
FRANK WILLS Umm… 

01:21:25
JAN GRAY And he was a jolly sorts of nice man and he clearly you know was switched on to the fact that… well, I don’t know, I mean I don’t know I’m not supposing that he was bit of a hero for me actually. 

01:21:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah… 

01:21:40
JAN GRAY Um… that he noticed. 

01:21:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah, it was someone who would help. 

01:21:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, he did. Yeah. 

01:21:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Even in that situation there was… there was one person. 

01:21:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah that’s important. 

01:21:50
FRANK WILLS Yeah, and then you know let’s… let’s… let’s try to finish that off and so Um… ah… I mean I feel for you very much that as a child having to go back to those (inaudible ) and continue some kind of relationship when you must have been very hurt. 

01:22:06
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:22:10
FRANK WILLS And all furious with them, and yet, you know you didn’t really have any… did you have no other option about the work that’s… ? 

01:22:15
JAN GRAY Well, I mean realistically the week in France, I couldn’t do anything. 

01:22:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:22:20
JAN GRAY You know I couldn’t I had to sort of grin and bearish. 

01:22:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:22:25
JAN GRAY I can remember coming home from that trip and walking through the back door and…and been really upset you know that he would be such a oh, yes a lot. 

01:22:35
FRANK WILLS Did anyone come for you? 

01:22:40
JAN GRAY Umm…well, I don’t know, I was crying to my mum. 

01:22:45
FRANK WILLS Did she? 

01:22:45
JAN GRAY Oh well, she would have fought the battles for me and that’s possibly you know I mean taught me things will, you know I rather than have her fight battles for me would have been helpful for her to giving me some tools, I could have fought the battles myself. 

01:22:55
FRANK WILLS So…so did she go storm in and? 

01:23:00
JAN GRAY Oh yes, she studied in that school, parents… 

01:23:00
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:23:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, the whole bit. Yes, which actually made matters worse. 

01:23:05
FRANK WILLS Alright, alright. 

01:23:05
JAN GRAY Really because, of course you know she go and never mourn with the parents in school, but then they still carried on you know afterwards. 

01:23:15
FRANK WILLS With the girls too? 

01:23:15
JAN GRAY Oh, yes. 

01:23:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah…yeah…yeah… You never quite clears that (inaudible ). Yeah, I mean, it’s interesting to hear Um… that you hope… can I just comment really that… 

01:23:25
JAN GRAY Yes. 

01:23:25
FRANK WILLS Um… Because this is an example isn’t it of someone helping really thinking that doing the best thing for you? 

01:23:35
JAN GRAY Yes. 

01:23:35
FRANK WILLS But actually it not being quite the right thing that you think not in retrospect those other things that perhaps could have been done. So, so I mean that’s interesting isn’t it that, that how it’s looking at the moment actually there are people who would help and sometimes, they help spot on right, the French teacher sometimes though and what they do isn’t… isn’t quite right. So, helping is a… is a more varied matter than perhaps it look at the first sight. 

01:24:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean that’s a interesting thought, isn’t it? 

01:24:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:24:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. I had a thought of my… what my mom and dad is helping. 

01:24:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:24:15
JAN GRAY But actually she was trying to help because it’s just didn’t. 

01:24:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. I mean again, I’m just speculating a bit you know, but I suppose that could lead one to conclude with that, you know actually, Um… I don’t want help if that’s how it’s gonna be as it was. 

01:24:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, I suppose you would really… 

01:24:35
MIKE SIMMONS So, there’s a quite a bit of change happening here. 

01:24:35
FRANK WILLS There is. And at this point because of other factors in the clients life we are actually bringing the therapy to an end and what we’re going to see next is a review of the therapy. And this is particularly important because we want to try and make sure that positive changes that happened in the therapy and during the time of therapy or actually carried through to the client’s life in a major way. And unfortunately, there is quite a strong research finding that quite a lot of gains in therapy get washed out. 

01:25:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:25:15
FRANK WILLS And do not generalize in that kind of way and that’s one of the reasons why CBT has laid particular emphasis on developing take away materials that the client can use not only during the therapy, but after the therapy. It is like the full records ah… for…for example, but here we are now in the final session and we are trying to look at how gains Um… to be made in our work can be carried forward into the future. And we’re using a particular format for doing this, this is actually a written form as you kind of would expect again because it’s that try it, and then keep that after the therapy… 

01:25:55
MIKE SIMMONS And take away out. 

01:25:55
FRANK WILLS And it’s called a blue print for the future. 

01:26:00
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. So what should we look out for? 

01:26:00
FRANK WILLS Okay well, I think it’s…it almost important to remember that, although this particular therapy is ending on a quite a high, note things are improving, moving forward. It’s quite lightly the some difficulties will arise in the future because basically, life is a fairly up and down thing… 

01:26:20
MIKE SIMMONS Sure. 

01:26:20
FRANK WILLS …normally. Um… We very much follow the philosophy of our friend Jerry Egan here and his idea that being for warmed is being for armed. So, what we want to do is to try and help Jan to realize that if difficulties do occur, this is not a queue as it would be for some clients to kind of go into a negative thought, Oh, no and… and everything has failed or I’, back to square one. But a time to apply her new skills, and this is particularly important in this situation with Jan because the other factor we mentioned earlier that was bringing the therapy to an end is the fact that she is about to move quite a distance away to a new area. So she would be meeting new people, new situations and these are very lightly to approve testing triggers for her. So, it’s useful that to think about how am I going to deal with these… 

01:27:20
MIKE SIMMONS Right. 

01:27:20
FRANK WILLS …situations, which are likely to test me. 

01:27:20
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, let’s have a look of that. 

01:27:25
Excerpt 7 (from Session 4) 

01:27:25
FRANK WILLS We could fit in (inaudible ) between what…you know]need to keep a slight eye on that, okay. 

01:27:30
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:27:30
FRANK WILLS But I mean…I mean that's quite a lot of stuff there, isn’t that? And it…it might be helpful Um… you know when you view…view the video of this session to maybe you write some of this stuff down. 

01:27:45
JAN GRAY Right. 

01:27:45
FRANK WILLS Uh… You know, maybe as a timeline or something Um… and to note down some of these instances. Because I almost feel it would look like this actually. 

01:27:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:27:55
FRANK WILLS You know the graph would be rising and form some tremendous affirmation at times, and then you know some quite deliberate looking out. 

01:28:05
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:28:05
FRANK WILLS At other times and you know sometimes that's true with the peers group, but not true of the… the authority figures and sometimes, it’s true, the authority figures, but not from the peer groups, it's quite a very pitch Um… but that’s my quick snapshots of it or how is it seem to you? 

01:28:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean I’m…I’m surprised that…that I sort of saw nobody, you know nobody helps… 

01:28:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:28:35
JAN GRAY …me I don’t believe anyone would help me because actually Um… I suppose the reality is that I can’t expect everybody to help me all the time, but there had people who have helped me. 

01:28:45
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:28:45
JAN GRAY And perhaps, what I have tend to look at it in all those people who I have been really helpful and influential and… 

01:28:55
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:28:55
JAN GRAY And given me lots of positives. 

01:29:00
FRANK WILLS And it, was there has been some pretty bleak periods in culminating, I think in Paris incident. 

01:29:05
JAN GRAY Umm… 

01:29:10
FRANK WILLS This, you know a bit further on the line has been something a bit better you know. And it reminds me as its one of my favorite images actually you know about that you know Um… have you ever driving on motor way and you…you see and you know there is a traffic jam on the other carriage way, and then you know you going and that can be quite a long several miles long. And then you get pass this and then further down the line you see people driving a lorry and you think oh, you don’t know what’s ahead of you. You are gonna be stop telling reasons. It’s almost like that, isn't it? In reverse for you even when the…when you get in the traffic jam was actually a nice clip on the road ahead because every time that’s been more somewhere, but… 

01:29:50
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

01:29:50
FRANK WILLS You know without not too much in the distance as it were. 

01:29:55
JAN GRAY Yeah and I suppose the fear my pattern in the past has tended to and it sounds sort of a bit…bit sort of old habit to forget about living and here or now when it’s okay because my tendency is always to being worrying about the next problem. 

01:30:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:30:15
JAN GRAY You know almost looking for the problem instead of enjoying what’s here and now. 

01:30:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Well, the function of worry, probably is to allow us to anticipate future problems because we need to that to some extent you know we’ve I’m not…I'm not from the school and things you know we can live and blessing the present all the time you know often we do have to have some you know, but the problem with worry is when that you know when it…when it’s get beyond usefulness it's useful to worry to some extent you know but then to you know do what you can or, and then umm… and think about something else. The problem of worry is often that it can’t be switched off. And so, we get into a useless worry you know sort of a ruminative worry. 

01:31:00
JAN GRAY Hmm…Hmm… It’s almost like blinkers, isn't it because what it stops… 

01:31:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:31:05
JAN GRAY …you can do you know same, anything other than the worry. 

01:31:10
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… Yeah…yeah. 

01:31:10
JAN GRAY It’s like worrying blinkers. 

01:31:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah…yeah. 

01:31:10
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:31:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, but fortunately, generally, fairly you know temporary thing that you know is…is the only true of the period while we’re worrying, if we can work on so that the attention returns to a broader focus after. 

01:31:30
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

01:31:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. Okay. So…so, before we leave this one, and I mean what…what if we had to umm… modify this belief that no one will help me, what might seem a, a more reasonable alternative? Of one that facts fits the fast that we just described, including some people being bloody horrible to you, excuse my French. 

01:31:55
JAN GRAY But I suppose some people have helped me. 

01:32:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:32:10
JAN GRAY And I can’t expect everybody to help me, but…but I… but some, but I can’t expect some people to help me. 

01:32:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, it’s likely that… 

01:32:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. 

01:32:25
FRANK WILLS …people will pop-up and… 

01:32:25
JAN GRAY And I’m just as like as anyone else to be helped. 

01:32:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:32:30
JAN GRAY And I think that’s possibly the helpful thought for me is that there is nothing…actually there is nothing different about me. 

01:32:40
FRANK WILLS There is no disqualifying feature. 

01:32:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, there is nothing that’s making me less worthy of helping anyone else. I’m just like everyone else. Yeah. 

01:32:50
FRANK WILLS That to say at least. 

01:32:50
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:32:50
FRANK WILLS And…and you might even be more helpable or something and more attractive… 

01:32:55
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:32:55
FRANK WILLS …for some people you probably help. 

01:33:00
JAN GRAY Yeah that’s…that’s something I need to keep in mind. I, in fact, I think am I right that one is only my book. 

01:33:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah…yeah. Well, and one way if that maybe going a step further on this is something that’s given the term umm…umm… umm…umm… you know a positive umm… log as it were and what that means is that, what you would do with that is as you keep it and it’s…it’s nice often to get a nice little book you know with a nice cover on it, particularly like for this. And you know the purpose of the…the book is to collect information and that confirms the idea that there are some people who will help you. So in other words whenever somebody does you…you write it down and you keep that on an ongoing basis. So, maybe, at times when you get into the old way thinking you can have a look at this and just remain yourself of some of the things has have happened in which you know say otherwise, as it were in the old schema, the old… 

01:34:10
JAN GRAY Well, I was thinking, I wish I could write you know you’ve helped me. 

01:34:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah. I would…umm… I would hope to get in there and I hope to appear in that one… 

01:34:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:34:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, so thanks and I would be pleased to be in that. 

01:34:20
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:34:25
FRANK WILLS You're alright? Okay. Anything else you want to say before we leave? 

01:34:30
JAN GRAY No, no. That’s fine, I think. Yeah. 

01:34:30
FRANK WILLS Okay, Alright, alright. So umm… the other thing, the final thing to look out this afternoon is you know the…the blue print that you did and I think you copy that haven’t you? And then, I mean the idea of this is that umm… you know that it…it can be umm… quite easy to umm… you know lose the benefits you get from any work like this you know, unless you do something to you know to keep it sort of in your mind a little bit, sometime. And you know, also another reason is that sometimes things will happen which will knock you bit of balance and you know that the danger is that you might get knocked back you know to…to you know work… where you were before so. This is designed to really to… to help you to think about how you can use what we developed here and develop it further and keep it mind, okay. 

01:35:40
JAN GRAY Hmm… 

01:35:40
FRANK WILLS So umm… Let that’s just you know go…go through it and, obviously out of them we need to read it word-for-word, but ah… just maybe, can you talk me through your…your main responses here. 

01:36:00
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:36:00
FRANK WILLS So…so, the first thing is you know umm… what you think you’ve learned from…from… this work we’ve been doing? 

01:36:05
JAN GRAY Well, I think the first thing there are right time is that when I feel something is true. It might not necessarily mean it is true. 

01:36:15
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:36:15
JAN GRAY Yeah. And I think that was you know I think something we told about early on. 

01:36:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:36:20
JAN GRAY That’s because I’m feeling some… 

01:36:25
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah. 

01:36:25
JAN GRAY To start to look at some evidence. 

01:36:25
FRANK WILLS So, you’re feeling, you’re making a massive presentation doesn’t go with me in that. 

01:36:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. And the other thing is that I that we have told about it either, I don’t believe people help me. 

01:36:40
FRANK WILLS Yeah…yeah…yeah. 

01:36:40
JAN GRAY And that was something I’ve learned. Umm… And I suppose something that comes in bit of a surprise really is that my childhood beliefs is still have some power, you know how…how much a lot of beliefs are still sort of influencing my mood. And also a lots about that because, of course, if I examine the beliefs from an adult’s head of course then they…they lose some of the power. 

01:37:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:37:05
JAN GRAY And so that’s been really useful going back and looking and thinking about my childhood beliefs. 

01:37:10
FRANK WILLS And can I just remind you there, you know that thing that we talked about, you know a belief can be quite you know reasonable way to make sense of difficult childhood experience you know, and it can be quite wise to decide; no ones helping me at the moment, people are you know, but the trouble is if that sticks around as a later time when perhaps, there are people over there, they will try to help you and…and yet it will may you are not safe as it were. 

01:37:40
 Yeah. And that was helpful taking about my childhood and…and because I don’t think I would have really understood that, that…that I think the first time you said it made sense to think that way as a child and that…that really felt. And, it really felt good that you had said, it really felt you had understood me and…and, but it also made me look that actually perhaps some of those beliefs, I don’t need to have anymore. 

01:38:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:38:05
JAN GRAY You know I can change them you know. So that was… I think that was a really a good to them in learning. And there is something else as well and that was from giving the presentations is how I feel is not necessarily how I look and that would explain possibly why the teachers at school didn’t help me. 

01:38:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:38:30
JAN GRAY Because… Perhaps how I look is… is a lot calmer than how I feel or perhaps I look more competent than I feel or whatever. 

01:38:40
FRANK WILLS That remains me of, you know you kind of saying your parents thought; Oh, Jan is alright, we don’t have to… 

01:38:45
JAN GRAY Yeah. 

01:38:45
FRANK WILLS …help her you know. 

01:38:45
JAN GRAY That’s right and… 

01:38:45
FRANK WILLS And you kind of got… you’ve taken that out with you a bit a rather. Is that right? 

01:38:50
JAN GRAY Yeah! I suppose what I can do from that is I can either use it because… use it to my benefit in my presentation. 

01:38:55
FRANK WILLS Sometimes, yeah! Just to get through a situation, yeah. 

01:39:00
JAN GRAY Yeah! But I can also learn that perhaps I need to tell people a little bit more… 

01:39:05
FRANK WILLS Sometimes that can be… 

01:39:05
JAN GRAY …about how I’m feeling. 

01:39:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:39:05
JAN GRAY So… So that… I think, that was really my main learning are and I’m amazed that of learned that much to be honest with you. 

01:39:10
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:39:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah! 

01:39:15
FRANK WILLS And you know, let’s look at next two together, you know what if you, you know what are you taking from the therapy that you think you will be able to you know build on that will be useful to you? 

01:39:30
JAN GRAY Well the concept of using the daily thought record, of writing it down. And I might even thought to keep a journal again, a dairy. Because I think that might help me. And… And to start to recognize the negative automatic thoughts you talked about. And… And to stop them, you know to challenge them. 

01:39:55
FRANK WILLS Tell me one thing, do you notice them in other people now yet? 

01:40:00
JAN GRAY Umm… I haven’t, but perhaps I will do now. 

01:40:05
FRANK WILLS Yeah, yeah, yeah! Well, my prediction is you will. And that will be nice because you realize that it’s not just you having it. 

01:40:10
JAN GRAY Right. 

01:40:10
FRANK WILLS A very pervasive I would say. 

01:40:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, I can see how they would be. I can see how they would be, yeah. 

01:40:15
FRANK WILLS Even therapists see in that way. 

01:40:20
JAN GRAY Oh really! 

01:40:20
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

01:40:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, so I think there is a… I think that just… 

01:40:25
MIKE SIMMONS So one ending leaves to another, the end of this program. Is there anything you’d like to say before we finish? 

01:40:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah, I think it’s just worth mentioning that one of the things that Jan and I were discussing was that we might keep some kind of email contact. And this is something that’s coming increasingly into her therapy. 

01:40:45
MIKE SIMMONS Sure! 

01:40:45
FRANK WILLS I even… I’ve even had one client who emailed me from Afghanistan, which is, yeah, quite a, you know there was no other way of getting in touch from there. But it's also worth mentioning that this won't be the last film and program that we would like to make on the… the therapy that Jan and I together, there’s plenty more to come. 

01:41:05
MIKE SIMMONS So, we end on shameless plug. 

01:41:05
FRANK WILLS You got me there, you go.

NARRATOR The School of Health and Social Sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communications skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice. We give critics of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples in an informative, but lighthearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series in common with other materials has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. If you are trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we will have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we’ve got to offer.
