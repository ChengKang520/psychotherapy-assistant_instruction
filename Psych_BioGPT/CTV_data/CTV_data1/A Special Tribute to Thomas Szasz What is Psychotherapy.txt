“What is Psychotherapy?”

Thomas Szasz, MD 

00:00:40
THOMAS SZASZ Ladies and gentlemen, can you hear me? Thank you. Well, Jeff, I am really overwhelmed although I expected some sort of celebrations and that's how it was scheduled. You are very kind. You have always been very kind and.. 

00:00:55
JEFF  This is -- 90 years old, to be 91 on April 15th, you at least will do remember his birthday and everybody will send him a birthday card. 

00:01:15
THOMAS SZASZ Well, thank you. 

00:01:15
JEFF Came here unassisted on the plane and he is here to continue to educate us and edify us. 

00:01:25
THOMAS SZASZ Well, I am lucky, thank you very much. I can’t take too much credit for being 90, almost 91. But I do take credit for never smoking, even though both my parents smoked and I grew up in a culture in which if you didn’t smoke by the time you were 14 or 15 you were abnormal. Not to mention Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis where I was – there was no space whatsoever, which was not filled with smoke. So -- but it was game easy to me, I was part of this independence or criticalness. Well, thank you all very much for coming. I am going to speak to you, I don’t know exactly how long I could, my paper quite sure there is a longer version which I will publish at some point. But it’s a very condensed paper and so far I say I'm critical of -- even of aspects of psychotherapy, please forgive me. And I will be happy to have some discussion afterwards. I will read the paper, but I read adlib. Now, I have a new title first of all, instead of the one that was originally listed. And it's just three words, but they are – English is obviously not my native language, but I like it and I think I mastered writing it, if not my accent. My title is Therapy Looking for Disease. Now, Jeff stole some of my thunder, which is diagnosis which really is a terrific summary there is really not much to add to it, but I will do my best. And I begin with a quote of old people people from Sigmund Freud. One of the last things he wrote at the end of his life, includes the following sentence, referring to psychoanalysis. Such activity as this is pastoral working the best sense of the world. In other words, he disavowed what he claimed all his life ambivalently on and off whether it is any kind of therapy, whether it’s any kind of disease, what is therapy? Well, that’s still being a debated, although now it's decided that it’s a –- what it is, sort of politically decided. Now, I have a very short statement to clarify terminology. I will use a term treatment to refer to certain procedures that persons perform on live bodies, such as removing an appendix or giving somebody a drug, operating generally, and I was doing something to the body, not to a person, the person is a patient, who gives consent to it, but the treatment is directed at your body. And I will use the term therapy to refer to certain relationships between persons, unrelated to bodies, that’s somebody else’s business. For example, a physician can give and terminology is crucial here and English is very precise give in the paper I will have it in emphasis can give therapy sorry, a physician can give treatment to someone who is sick in his body. But a therapist cannot give therapy to someone who has a problem in living. Therein the patient must minister to himself, it’s from Macbeth, about lady Macbeth diseases. Now already Shakespeare of course was a genius, and besides he had an advantage of living before this became institutionalized. So, he was good speaker and I would say there and say that the patient must minister to himself and obviously who caused lady Macbeth disease? Herself. That has been my point all along that this is not a disease that – let’s say, cold or like tuberculosis or like a broken leg, which is why every therapy works and no therapy works, because a patient is a therapist if he or she wants to be and can be. Now, disease usually entails suffering and impels the patient who seek treatment. The behaviors or misbehaviors, however you want to call it, that we call metal illness does not necessarily entails suffering. On the contrary, more often it makes other people suffer. Now that is a simple reason why other people usually want the denominated patient to have treatment and if necessary they resort to coercion or bribing, subordining(ph) in effect to therapist of his money. This is why many coercions are called therapy and therapy in that sense is an important part of the therapy industry. I really don’t know how much of the therapy or what goes under therapy is coursed in these broad terms, most literally coursed which force or circumstantially or obviously all of the addiction therapies fall into that category because you suddenly become sick, you get arrested to DWI and then you’re suddenly sick or for various other problems you know, crimes or interpersonal problems. Now, psychotherapy, as you probably all know is a very decent term only 30 years older than I am. It was coined in 1890. And a concept it seems to me has a reason in response to personal and social problems, consequent to the enlightment, a very relate consequence. It’s almost a 20th-century idea, thus you know. So interpretation of dreams which is a kind of a timeline was published in 1900. So, we are talking only about a 100 years. Now, I’m quoting for a statement by Soren Kierkegaard. In our time, and listen to this very carefully, it’s very short quote. In our time, it is a physician who exercises the cure of souls and he knows what to do and then follows a hypothetical dialog between the doctor and the patient. The doctor says, "you must travel to a watering place and then you must keep riding a horse and then have a diversion, plenty of diversion." And the patient says incredulously to relieve an anxious, conscious? Doctor replies, pause, get out of that stuff and anxious, conscious, no such thing exists anymore. Abolishing lady Macbeth -- abolishing the Madoff suicide this morning which is on the news, abolishing everyday life as we know it now. What’s guilt? Everybody speculates why this fellow killed himself, well, I don’t know why he killed himself, but I presume he was guilty. He ought to have been guilty if he wasn’t. How did he -- what did he do it living that lifestyle for whatever 60 years, 50 years. In 1900, psychotherapy, by 1900 psychotherapy was a well established term and the highly accepted therapeutic modality of course. 50 years later, in 1950, by which time I was practicing psychologist, 50 years later, psychotherapy was started as a revolutionary method of saving mankind. This is a well quote which I’ve used in numerous publications. The Canadian psychiatrist Brock Chisholm, who became the first director of World Health Organization, which is a big operation now in UN said the following. The reinterpretation and eventual eradication was a concept of right and wrong as a belated objective of practically all effective psychotherapists. If the race is to be freed of its crippling burden of good and evil, it must be psychiatrists who take the original responsibility. Well, there is no such a thing as pastoral counseling, I don’t know how they reconcile all these statements. Chisholm proposed using psychotherapy to eliminate poverty and war. "The world is sick and the ills are due to the perversion of man. The microbe is not the enemy, it’s not a virus disease. Microbe is not the enemy. Science is sufficiently advanced to cope visit where it not force barriers of superstition ignorance, religion, religious intolerance, misery, and poverty. These psychological evils not social, psychological evils must be understood that the remedy might be prescribed and the scope of the task before the committee of the world so there is no mental healthy, therefore knows no balance. Now, this idea of no balance is of course obviously very important to me because this is of course what is meant by totally therein nowadays and previously was total government that mean knowing no balance, I mean, you know what that is. By my 20s, if perhaps earlier, I concluded that the condition conventionally called mental illness, madness insanity, vis-a-vis it's interesting that other languages, many other language, European languages including German and Hungarian have no word for mind, so they don’t really have a real word for mental illness. French also doesn’t have a word for mental illness, has a word for mind. But I concluded that mental illness is not a brotherly illness, hence not a medical problem at all. Instead well, obviously there is something, people believe in it. It’s religion, it’s a fiction like god if you like, if you – unless you are religious. Well, any other metaphor, I mean, we all use metaphors. Metaphorical illness to which we attribute causal agents, now this is crucial because we see why did somebody do something, we say he’s mentally ill that caused it. But how can mental illness cause something? 

00:13:40
[sil.] 

00:13:45
THOMAS SZASZ A metaphor to which causal agents to which we attribute much practical social use, especially as a justificatory explanation for imparting legitimacy or illegitimacy to the scene, legitimacy to the scene to control your instinct so called. Personally, I found demythologizing mental illness and psychiatry – liberating much as a child I found demythologizing god and religion liberating. You no longer have to be afraid of what god will do to you for example. Although therapy is a non-medical relationship viewing it as treatment continues to be the leading model for understanding or I see misunderstanding it. And now I will quote from some of the organic use of this and some of the super psychological views both of which to my mind are unsatisfactory because obviously – it’s a metaphor. Now, a psychiatrist called Henry Nasrallah, professor of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Editor of the journal called Current Psychiatry explains how he views psychotherapy. Often I think I quote – "Often I think about evidence based conduct of psychotherapy, that’s a very fashionable word now evidence based, conduct of psychotherapy which I regard as a neurobiologic treatment similar to drug therapy. And then, I ask research questions that remain unanswered such as, what is a therapeutic dose of psychotherapy? It gets better, this goes on for a page and a half, I will only quote short paragraph it gets, it’s hilarious. What is a therapeutic dose of psychotherapy? Does it differ by the type of therapy or the patient’s diagnosis? By what criteria does the therapists determine how often to administer psychotherapy? What effect does food have on psychotherapy efficacy? Is an empty stomach and hunger better or worse for the patients. Is there a possible benefit for a postprandial session when serum glucose levels are higher. Good cognition be sharper for a simulating psychotherapy after eating or before? That goes on and on like this for a page and a half. What he calls, these are research questions. Yes, research questions and I presume non-research questions. Now this is what comes from misinterpreting and incorporeal metaphor, it's a material object thing. Now an important, particular people psychiatrist who happens to be a colleague Chetan Haldipur an Indian, American-Indian, noted that psychotherapy seems to be easier to practice than to define, which is very nice, that’s why I’m quoting it. And then asked – then he asked what we are asking in a way, what do we mean when we say that we are engaged in psychotherapy with our patient? And it was a very nice little paper saying that nobody knows what we mean. Anything and everything. Now, it was not Haldipur's intention to answer this question, but I can answer it very briefly. Psychotherapy is a name we attach to many diverse types of helpful or allegedly helpful interventions. In other words, we say it’s helpful. Another powerful metaphoric word what’s help? Who defines help? Help to do what? None of which has strictly peaking any direct relationship to health as a medical concept. I emphasize this badly because this is a very live issue more so in the UK than in this country as to how you classify this because as soon as you classify there’s a health issue, it is taken out of the hand of the therapist. He cannot charge for it. The tech support service like the police or like Clean Water. You are just an agent of the government, with all its consequences, unless you think the government is a – all good institution, this is a powerful thing and this is what we have in the UK, now it's medicine of course as you know. I continue by saying, well, obviously no one knows what it is, but it’s not a medical issue in this view, in my view. In fact, the only thing about psychotherapy that we can be absolutely sure about that this is not a form of medical treatment. Now, that fact – to me is a fact, it doesn't matter as long as there is no political power to oppose it, I mean, think of war making I mean what are we doing in Afghanistan? We’re going to win a war there and do what? It’s not like a second world war, I mean, and what do we do there? The accounts of therapist, instead of doctors that is mental health professionals who are sensibly as true the medical model of mental illness as unhelpful, nevertheless in many of these fall into this trap. And now I would actually quote some of our colleagues and I don’t mean to pick out and cos' this is generally true. They generally advertise it, whereas, instead of clarifying their verdicts. I will sight three brief examples using summaries from Wikipedia because I’m taking Wikipedia as an own, their own verdicts to describe what they do because Wiki publish purpose Wikipedia I think is quite good, it’s kind of a populist, you know what Wikipedia is. Now, I begin this -- our former colleagues Albert Ellis’ Rationally Motive Behavior Therapy, REBT. It’s important that they all have this kind of acronymic abbreviation. REBT is a comprehensive active directive philosophically and empirically base psychotherapy, which focuses on the resolving problems and emotional and behavioral problems and disturbances in enabling people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. Now, I don’t mean to, as I said already to make too much run of this, but this is what the religious fanatics in Muslim countries now says join to have a happy drive and you will lead more fulfilling lives, even if you blow yourself up, I mean these are peculiar terms, more fulfilling life, fulfilling in what? Mother Theresa. I mean that is what life is about deciding what is fulfilling, according to who? Live like Madoff, Robert Madoff and then go to jail when you are 70 or 65 or 80. Was that a fulfilling life? Live like Lenin or Hitler or Obama, I mean, well you and me, what’s fulfilling? Now, the second one I will be gonna -- is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing EMDR and this is what Wikipedia says it is, RMDE, EMDR psychotherapy is an information processing therapy and uses an eight phase approach to address experiential contributors for a wide range of pathologies. Here I wrote my book about Hertz(ph), EMDR is now accepted as a treatment of choice by numerous mental health departments and trauma organizations. The Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs practice guidelines have placed EMDR in the highest category recommended for all trauma populations of all times. Now, I can’t think of a recommendation, I would less want that the US government Department of Defense recommending what is good psychotherapy? I mean, can you imagine a greater self contradiction? Good psychotherapy after people get their leg shot off then they get psychotherapy? Why do they get their lock shut up, I mean there are historical logical answers, these are not – wars don’t happen. Now the last one and I don’t want to really overdo this, I mean this is a minor, you know one could, could write a book about this. Neurolinguistic Programming, NLP is based on a model of interpersonal communication, everyone says so, chiefly concern this relationship between successful patterns of behavior and subjective experiences underlying them and the system of alternative therapy based on this which seeks to educate people in self awareness and effective communication. Now, enough of that. But my comment is a primitives of these acronymic, sometimes often copyrighted therapist, now -- and the (inaudible ) they tried to copyright it, now of course, how you copyright something, which is an interpersonal relationship according to themselves, that’s a story behind it which I will go into, maybe you know the story. These are pseudo technical vocabularies that in turn uplifting abstractions and do not identify concrete rules defining and delimiting the practitioner’s powers. Now, I emphasize the last point because Jeff already, very lovingly summarized it, that we are talking about power healing. Who is pushing whom around is what and there are two ways of pushing people around his guns and his money. That’s right money, capitalism is a very important concept cos' that’s the only counter-wheeling power to political power or it can be the same power essentially by government, by becoming a senator or a President. We all know about it. Using the term therapy beclouds a direct what I call dramaturgy cos' it’s not really my word, a dramaturgic understanding of the problems therapists and their clients face. And the best example for this is Shakespeare’s great tragedies cos' it will portray this kind of in – that’s why we call it a tragedy after the Greeks. It comes out with a character of the person who wants most power and integrity or power and sex or whatever, which I internally in conflict which is a obvious thing, which very soon must be discovered that – the rules is mental illness is conflict because we want different goods which conflict with another. Although most of the concept that therapists use of therapy is radically different for most physicians concept of treatment is which I began. The vocabulary of psychopathology and psychotherapy and the therapists and this includes no one has to put the shirt on if it doesn’t fit, but this includes many therapists. And the therapists generally speaking throughout the world identification is the role of physician obscures the differences I have been talking about. See who are you going to identify with this? You really only have two choices and neither of them fits perfectly well. One is a physician and the other one is a priest, no, that’s another subject. Well, I wrote a book about that The Myth of Psychotherapy deals with that. This is essentially a priestly, a priestly vocation without god, now how does that work? Without formal religion. Perceived as an integral part of the healthcare system, the therapy industry expands in tandem which is a mental health industry of which both are important parts while suite of the secular cure of souls shrinks towards non-existence. And I will spend the rest of this relatively short presentation, it’s not so short. On general remarks on this issue, when people suffer and we all suffer at various times, sometimes or almost all the time and people suffer and they mean suffer now it’s generic sense from disease, oppression or want, physical or mental or spiritual. They naturally seek assistance from experts who have the knowledge, skill or power to help them or more importantly one whom the suffering person projects such attributes, because how much of this expertise is pure attribution. Now in ancient times and actually for thousands of years, priests believed to poses ability to intercede with the gods, there is a premier depositories of such authority. And older Greek tragedies involved priests, of course in gods who control life. Over a very long periods, curing souls, healing bodies, relieving economic social and political difficulties were all regarded as priestly activities. And in some ways, the more traditional Muslim countries still shows how this works where priestly figures are also political figures and they looked upon us as Quasar Healers(ph) as indeed Jesus was after all a healer, not a doctor, but a healer, who also healed physical diseases. Only in the last few centuries, this is what we call basic enlightenment in the West, this really didn’t happen, quite the same way elsewhere. Only the last few centuries have these rules become gradually differentiated as religion, medicine and politics, each carving out, now think of these categories, religion, medicine, and politics, each carving out it supports proper suite of influence, what that proper suite is, is a matter of debate. Each still overlapping and struggling with others to enlarge its own scope and power. Now, for example, in organized catalysis religion is still in charge also of healthcare century, that’s right the pope quite rightly, rightly from that point of view is quoted is involved in all kinds of health matters like when – can you use a condom if you have HIV or is that a -- and so, well you know all that. One of the results of this differentiation is a dual function of the therapist and this theme of course has been important to my own life and work. Dual functional therapists sometimes are individuals ally, sometimes is adversary, yet even if he is adversary, all of is defined as his ally by power. And there are no official therapists who see what I want to do is enslaving, make you unhappy and so on. Now, as you know there are doctors who are in the business of torturing people and so on and now of course psychologist or psychiatrists, have been in the past too. Because element of dependency is intrinsic to the patient role, client role, whatever you want to call it, the only way to compensate for the asymmetry of power between therapist and patient is by limiting the therapist professional behavior repertoire. But it's essentially by criminalizing certain kinds of behavior on the part of the therapist, among which I would include locking up people, letting those innocent of a crime. I think every psychiatrist who locks up a person, so called civil commitment because a person is depressed, he’s a criminal. He’s locking up an innocent person. Don’t you have a right to be depressed? Well, if you put it that way the answer is obvious. But the answer is not obvious because all you have to do – all any naïve American has to do this evening, tomorrow is to walk into a psychiatrist office and say doctor I need your help and then duties of conversation bring up the fact that he’s really so unhappy, his marital problems, he has lost his job that he’s really wants to kill himself. Within an a hour or two he will find himself locked up in a mental hospital. If he is not, the psychiatrist will be in danger of being sued for malpractice. I see you nodding your head, thank you, I hope you follow me. This is what we have constructed out of this everybody to care and everybody cares, you know, obviously you want to save lives, that what makes you a healer, a therapist, the one who save lives. Well, then they institutionalize that, there'll be a physician assistant suicide. So psychiatrist both prevent suicide and promote suicide to our doctors. Well, if you like that then have all of it. Therapy aimed at enlarging the patients’ liberty and responsibility requires that the therapist and the client, now, this is kind of impossibility, but this is not really a impossibility because this is what psycho analysis in its most glorified forum was about, but it became of course corrupted too very quickly by for it himself. Such an arrangement which we call existential very often nowadays requires that the patient and the therapist, client use themselves as existentially equal moral agents. Now, that’s easier said than done cos' to be existentially moral agents implies two very simple things to me. One is that each is responsible for his own conduct and self control. It’s not a paternalistic relationship. The therapist is not responsible for what your patient does. And you can say what kind of therapist is that? Well, different kind of therapist. The major obstacles that has prevented, major obstacles that has prevented psychotherapy from reaching its promise in the past and now bodes ill for its future as I see it is a spirit of paternalism and a passion for coercion, helpful coercion if you like that enemies many of its practitioners. Now, I should digress it for a minute because this helpful coercion is a very, very complex subject because we are helpfully coercive if we are any good at all vis-à-vis our children, any children, afterward – where do this come from, have to take care of you because you’re making a mistake, that’s a parental role. That’s why we call it paternalism or mentalism, it’s totally appropriate as a five-year old, but we are not five-year old all the time, we become 10, we become 15, we become 80. Romeo and Juliet would be sex criminals now, right? Whereas we see it played out with the Mormons. How old do you have to be before you can give consensual consent? Is it consensual, if you are 17 and 364 days old, next day it’s consensual . These are rules though which are absolutely necessary in life and we don’t pay any attention to them to speak of it, not certainly, not in psychiatry, psychotherapy. Most contemporary psychotherapists, especially medical psychotherapists cling to the concept of mental illness and reject as a strewing(ph) of professional powers to control the dangerous mental patient "dangerous mental patient." This vishads our effort to maintain role integrity as a client’s agent and precludes their practicing psychotherapy as a secular version of what I call the cure of souls. The ophthalmologist does not remove appendices or do that kind of work. The psychotherapist professes to heal of his words oath not to prescribe drugs, prevent suicide or otherwise interfere in or with the patient’s life. The very idea of testifying in a court of law as an expert in psychology or psychiatry his country to these principles. Could a court of law is for the jury to decide, for experts who can testify about facts like like did this bullet fire a bullet, has it never been fired or did the men drown or was he shot, in other words, it's factual determinations, medical determinations. Psychiatry psychologists testify about say criminal responsibility, again, look at the word responsibility. But how can you testify the word responsibility? If you had accepted this an expert and who accept you as an expert, the state. Why? Because it wants to use you. Now, I’m going to draw an interesting contrast, which you may not have saw. The American government and only the American government historically now this has spread, but now American government is only one, and America still unique in this respect and this is what has partly made America great and continues to important. The American government makes no effort, has never made any effort to provide for the spiritual help of the citizen, otherwise known as the separation of church and state. Supposing an educated American where to interpret this as withholding religious services from people who needed the most, supposing is ever person, he would be dismissed as a person ignorant of the relationship between church and state in the American constitution and the constitutionally imposed prohibition against coercion in the name of god. Exactly the opposite is a situation in medicine. If you don’t do what the government defines is for the health of the person you gotta withholding essential mental health. That term is crucial, of course, withholding is part of definition very often of malpractice. Think of the diabetic parent who withholds treatment from the child. He can withhold treatment from himself unless he is declared crazy, which are always witnesses this is a very life legal issue, a medical issue. Now, I quote, I’m finished with the presentation except for a quote from one of my heroes if you’d like, the curiously unknown accepting political philosophy, 18th century, political writer, a member of parliament, Edmond Berk, who was one of the few really influential Englishmen in those days and this you have to obviously be a famous person and an important person to oppose the revolutionary war, the war of England against the US in 1776. Now, he wrote the following, which wasn’t very popular in England as you know. It requires a deep courage to be temperate when the voice of multitudes that’s specious mimic of fame and reputation and the voice of multitudes passes judgment against you. The impetuous desire of an unthinking public will endure no course, but what conducts, that is leads to what conducts to splendid and perilous extremes and then, dare to be fearful, when all about you are full of confidence. Now the future of psychotherapy in the service of all powerful state seems very secure its future, the service of the individual seems to me very insecure, I feel for it to paraphrase the book. Thank You.

00:44:00
THOMAS SZASZ Thank you very much, thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Don’t over do it. 

00:44:30

00:44:40
UNKNOWN I have a very large program for children and it's children, we do early intervention pre-schools special added mental health services and it seems to me, what you're saying when you talk about psychotherapy with adults and then you talk about the parental relationship to the child, must mean that the work I do, does not exactly fit into the model you are talking about. Am I right? 

00:45:15
THOMAS SZASZ I'm sorry, I didn’t. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN With children. 

00:45:15
THOMAS SZASZ What children are not adults. 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN I know they are not, what you are talking about of the freedoms to make choices. 

00:45:25
THOMAS SZASZ The freedom of what? 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN To make choices. 

00:45:25
THOMAS SZASZ Yeah. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN To choose is different when we do. 

00:45:35
THOMAS SZASZ I am happy you said that I am not happy, so it is because I consider old child therapy, I'm exaggerating, but not much, child abuse. Now I tell you, this is essentially a shocking kind of point of view, is shocking because everybody in his soul shares it cos' none of us wants to pushed around as a child. Now children are taken to therapy because their parents are doing something wrong. And many of Freud's original case histories, the young historic women, what was wrong with them, that their father was screwing it out, and they knew it and they are upset. And instead of being protected from divorce and the trauma of what was going on in the family, they send them to Freud, and Freud collected a lot of money. Unless you see I speak about the equal existential equality, existential equality means that you most have roughly equal money, you can't get money from being sick, mentally sick, which is now the situation. Millions of Americans are now living of being certified mental patients, this is why I am not particularly popular with mental patient, ex-mental patients either, the two groups that completely reject this view are psychiatrist, medical MD psychiatrist and ex-patients. They always will talk about freedom and how they were locked up and complain, they never talk about the incentive(ph) defense which to me are one and the same thing, you incriminate an innocent person and you excuse a guilty person, what can, pure morality or immorality pure, but this is what we're talking about, no, child therapy is outside of my, again I wrote about it and I, there is no such thing, there can't be any thing. And I have -- in my own practice, I have practiced, sports practiced or whatever you want to call it, define in, I have talked to people, the relationship with them and I had quite a few adult of course you are all adults, but from the kind of circle, medical, you know psychotherapy psychiatry university circles, quite a few of these adults, young adults had to be in psychotherapist psychiatrist whatever you want to call it as children, not one of them thought that it was any good for them, they all thought it was pure trauma. Well, how did, what did people think of soviet free medicine during the height of Stalinism, it was a best thing, it was shame of the rest, that you've to pay money if you were sick, what did they think afterwards, what do they are think now, they have the highest mortality, in the western world so called western world. Free, what you get free is dangerous because free means the government pays for it, there is no free I mean, we’re talking about the human service, I mean if you are a therapist you have to live on )something too, so this brings up the whole issue of payment implicit in my writings is that you cannot have psychotherapy as I conceive of it unless the patient pays out of his own pocket just like he is paying for, when he goes to a movie or a opera or buys chocolate or cigarettes or whatever, this is something he wants and in a way by being for it, you see there can be no such thing as involuntary treatment because by being for it you consent and you say you want it cos' if you don’t want it all you have to do is not show up the next time, or not pay your bill, in which case therapist will say thank you Mr. Jones ) I have to get paid for my service and, you know go back. Now this, you can't do is any more because you can't fire your patient, but you know it is all, so called what is now called medical ethics, can you imagine what medical ethics would have been if there would have been such a thing in Nazi Germany, it's a huge legitimizing agents, legitimizing agents, I can’t emphasize it. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN And just tell me how used propose we help or handle children who are suffering, they don’t have money. 

00:50:35
THOMAS SZASZ What do you mean children's suffering, childhood is nothing, but suffering at least I had a very good upbringing in childhood, but it was, cos' you want to be free, you want to know what’s going on, you want to know sex, everything is close to you, you have to eat when people tell you, you have to sleep when people tell you or do children like that, this is called as child, this is -- in the organ, he is, the first think your child does is spit out your food, that (inaudible ) spits it in his face and laughs at age nine months, I mean there you have it in a microcosm, you are just trying to help him, you are feeding him. 

00:51:20
DAVY Dr. Szasz, its really good to see you, hello I am over here and Happy Birthday for April and it'll be great to see you in 2013. My name is Davy, I'm the wife of Albert Ellis and I am confused about your skepticism about what my husband meant by... 

00:51:40
THOMAS SZASZ Excuse me, can you speak a little slower, I have trouble. 

00:51:40
DAVY Yes, sorry, I am confused about your skepticism about what my husband meant or what REBT means when it wants once when it has a goal for people to have more fulfilling lives simply put I believe what Alber Ellis had intended was for people to empower themselves, to choose to learn how to think in healthy, healthful ways to, so that they do not create unnecessary emotional suffering, so that they create healthy appropriate emotions and therefore live a more fulfilling life by minimizing suffering, which as you rightly pointed out is an inevitable part of life and therefore by minimizing it having greater joy. My hunch is that you would share his desire for people to suffer less and be happy much more, he didn’t kidnap clients and by the way he judged very little, they voluntarily came, he empowered many of them to feel or to recognize the choices they had to have better lives, I will stop talking now and I would love to hear what your response is. 

00:53:05
THOMAS SZASZ I have trouble following what she says. 

00:53:05
JEFF Well Albert Ellis' philosophy was about psychotherapy and how psychotherapy was designed to -- to eliminate human suffering but I don't know that there's a question-- you can ask her what her question is. 

00:53:20
THOMAS SZASZ I am sorry, I had trouble following you and I didn’t know what if you have a question. 

00:53:25
DAVY Shall I put it very simply. Can you clarify your skepticism about the line about REBT that it helps clients who use it have more fulfilling lives. 

00:53:45
JEFF About the specific therapy (inaudible ). 

00:53:52
THOMAS SZASZ Well, I am not criticizing any one of these therapist, which I have mentioned, as long as you are completely consensual and the patient pays for it from his own pocket. I thought that goes without question because the only person who is legitimately defining whether it's helpful or not is a patient. The patient who comes voluntarily if there is no coercion and if there is no secondary gain from being a patient then it has, no, just like with religion, I personally I'm not religious, but if people feel relief from going to Senegal, go to catholic church and so on, its called freedom I am totally in favor of it, but on the other hand I intellectually oppose to defining it as a healthcare, as like medicine that is an intellectual opposition. 

00:54:40
DAVY So you are supportive of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and its goal of helping people have more fulfill and relaxed. 

00:54:45
THOMAS SZASZ It’s not rational, it’s not emotive, its not, those are all meaningless words, just selling words, advertising words. They are pure advertising, uplift, well that is what religion is, I mean you know. Come and love Jesus and you know, it's on the bumper stickers and then you feel better and selling hope is perfectly legitimate thing because we all need hope, so come and join Afghan resistance. 

00:55:25
DAVY But Dr. Szasz. 

00:55:30
THOMAS SZASZ Repels your invaders I mean you will, then you will go to heaven, there is 200 virgins. 

00:55:35
DAVY But Dr. Szasz the words Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy are simply words identifying approach and you seem to have an allergy to those words. 

00:55:50
JEFF Do you have an allergy to the words Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy? You answer the question... 

00:55:55
THOMAS SZASZ Well, yes. No not really, not particularly to those words, but I certainly have serious question about using of word rational in the mental health business because. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:56:20
THOMAS SZASZ  I also have, I have similar objections to all these words that’s why I have trouble with the word the reality therapy, I could have picked that one cos' whose reality I mean this is what literature is about, this is what travel is about, whose reality, yeah. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN In '99, in 2002, I was writing my doctoral dissertation at Columbia and it was on the history of psychiatric nursing. During the process of collecting data, I went to Rockies University and interviewed a psychiatric nurse and one of my questions had to do with your work that I had read, I asked her pointedly about what she thought about your idea that there is no such thing as mental illness and she went ballistic jumping out of the seat and telling me that you were a kin to a criminal and that you are making it worse for those suffering from mental illness. And so I incensed her by asking this mere question and I was wondering what challenges you faced for standing up for yourself and how did you deal with them. 

00:57:40
JEFF There's some challenges that you've had, how did you deal with them? 

00:57:45
THOMAS SZASZ Oh, you don't wanna know about that. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN But I do, could you just give a clue I can see how you are very spirited and I think that has something to do with your response. 

00:58:00
THOMAS SZASZ Very what? 

00:58:05
JEFF Very spirited. 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN Could you just give me a... 

00:58:05
THOMAS SZASZ Well, thank God, yeah. 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN I am very curious. 

00:58:10
THOMAS SZASZ Well really what are you asking, who I am -- who am I or what? 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN No I'm asking how, you must have been faced with challenges for standing up to what you believe, so I am wondering or what the challenges were and how did you handle them. 

00:58:25
JEFF  Who has criticized you the most? And how you handled them? 

00:58:30
THOMAS SZASZ Who has criticized me the most? 

00:58:35
JEFF And how you handled it? 

00:58:35
THOMAS SZASZ Well some of that is public record I don’t know if you about that, I wrote a short piece and there is a long -- there is a book by a friend of mine, edited book called Szasz Under Fire. Are you aware of that book? 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:58:55
THOMAS SZASZ Published by a small publisher, I don’t think it sold may copies, it consist entirely of criticisms of 12 of different chapters and my replies to them and there is a very good introduction to it, which describes how after I published. And okay you asked a question I will give you a short answer. I knew that was not going to please a lot of people when I wrote "The Myth of Mental Illness," which I had in my mind really for a long time, I really had this basic ideas that Jeff kindly and wonderfully summarized humorously for a long time, before I went to medical school, I went to medical school if you want to know about me because for various reasons partly because I had a lot of childhood illness. I wanted to become a doctor and in particularly, it wasn’t that clear, I didn't particularly, I wasn't so much, I was interested in some kind of medical practice, but I wanted to understand, you know first I studied physics, chemistry I was good in the science and then I went to medical school, then I spent two years actually as a medical, into an medical resident planning to become a doctor but I was also interested in politics, not psychiatry so much as )life, drama. So, then I changed I thought I would become a psychiatrist and all along this time I the idea that there is no mental illness I mean that was part of my interest, what is illness. So from my relatively early age, younger than illness, is it a scientific concept, no one debate about illness that’s right this, they wrote -- acquires their own history and their own existence the word medical model is an extremely unfortunate word, it's often associated with my work, medical model versus non-medical model, but is it suggesting as a non-medical model of measles or tuberculosis or brain tumor, medical modeling means it’s a disease and everyone knows what a disease is, pathologist everybody knows except psychiatrist because they see it’s a mental illness, what they look into brain, they talk about your brain Time Magazine talks about the brain, everybody talks about the brain, what has the brain got to do with it, the Greek saw it had -- mind was in the liver or in the spleen or god knows where. The video has got nothing to do with it except of course without a brain, without even mind, but without the liver we don’t ever mind either. Not to mention without a heart without some oxygen into brain, I mean obviously we are dependent on this physical apparatus, but that goes without seeing, but studying this physical apparatus is not going to do, touch any of these issues until we abolish literature, drama or movies. So, I am sorry, how to answer -- how to develop, obviously you need a good deal of, I am hesitating because I don’t know what to put first, you need to, it’s a good idea to have a good deal of education so that you can feel that you stand on the reason I believe firm grounds, when you are making some sort of complicated statement. Secondly, maybe firstly it's extremely important I should have said that first cos' that really is what I learned for various reasons growing up, I grew up really and a very favorable person in favorable circumstances, but between, I was born in 1920 and left Hungary in 1938, now these had exactly, not quite exactly 39, the wars that, these are exactly the years when the war ended and the other one, second one started. Actually Hungary was still at war when I was born because when signed treaty did not apply to Hungary. Hungarians had a special treaty at Trianon and that’s kind of a Hungarian -- big Hungarian deal because that was a great -- but Hungary itself was tired of the, you know two-thirds of Hungary was given to other countries, which previously didn’t exited that for like Czechoslovakia, there was no Czechoslovakia it was a newly created country. 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:04:00
THOMAS SZASZ Very much like Iraq didn’t exist for example, a separate -- its very, very important events after the first World War. So at any case, for various reasons I became extremely aware of power. I was also the youngest one in my family, so that helped for this that you have to be careful also there is a great deal in Hungarian history, which can be romanticized which touches, so I don't wanna go into all that, so I actually consciously withheld publishing my views or telling them except to a very, very few people. To give you one per -- specific(ph) example, I went to University of Chicago, I was number one in my graduating class in medical school, I was a very good student, I worked very hard, I wanted to know what was going on, I wanted to have good grades, so I had to pick up where I wanted to go, I went to University of Chicago clinics because I wanted to get training in psychoanalysis, but primarily now mind you this is -- I graduated in 1944, so we are literally talking about virtually, the entirety of modern American psychiatry. The war had not yet ended when I graduated and the University of Chicago was relatively small medical school and believe it or not it did not have a department of psychiatry that are separate department. It was a sub-department of the department of medicine and it had no in-patients, it had outpatient clinic and if somebody had to admitted for some kind of you know had to be parked in a hospital voluntarily what would now be a sanatorium, they would be admitted with a fake medical diagnosis, this was a routine like gastroenteritis and then a psychiatrist would see them on the medical ward, this was a arrangement at University of Chicago in those days. So, I went there after the war, the Chairman was an Englishmen originally disappeared after a year or so. The whole department actually as I recall there was a Chairman and (inaudible ) and there were I think two psychiatrists and one there is me me. No in-patients because I was opposed to locking people up long before, so I thought this is perfect, for me it is great, so I served two years to nearly three years for certification of psychiatry and the Chairman, who was a very nice man he was only ten years older than I, Henry Brosen(ph). I -- nothing against him on the contrary, gonna be fun memories of him. He was a nice guy, didn't know much, but you know I had studied already Freud and what not, and I really immersed myself in what, you know, I knew more than these fakers I mean as far as I concerned they were, and the Chicago Institute was not much better. So after two years the system, there is a problem, your are going to finish your residency and you have never worked seriously ill patients, those were his words, this is psychiatric lingo for criminals or poor people, I locked up at Cook County Hospital, Chicago those of you know Chicago. Now that’s why I went to University of Chicago in order to avoid these people, in order to avoid dealing with people who in effect and had this dialogue in my head. Doctor says you want to help me get me out of here, what do I do then, stayed simple now this is what, you know Freud's most famous case, which people still say the Schreber, Judge Schreber, the Schreber case, Schreber wants to get out, Freud was uninterested and he is being locked up, I pointed this out in one of my first books, Schreber managed to get out despite the doctors because he was a judge and he prepared appropriate legal papers and got himself free through the legal system, I don’t know if you knew that. So the first thing is, be careful so I didn’t say this to anyone and I had and obviously I had a few friends I mean these ideas are not unique to me. I consider this is an obvious ideas, common sense ideas, love of freedom and what's new about that and you know psychiatric jokes I mean this controversy is hundreds of years old. There is a huge literature on mostly by ex-patients look how -- what they did to me, which I actually collected in a book called “The Age of Madness" in 1970s. So back to Brosen and the story about me, so comes end, towards the end of the second year, this the Chairman and I used to play, we were both pretty good tennis players, we evenly mentioned we were regular tennis partner, we played tennis all the time, beautiful courts at the University of Chicago campus, you know nice campus. And so he calls me into the and says you know you have to, I want you to serve your third year at Cook County Hospital, but you will get a credit as a university of Chicago graduate, you never say I will get the prestige of university Chicago. And it took me thirty seconds literally to know how to deal with this, I said thank, I thanked for that suggestion that’s not why I came to university Chicago I resigned. Now this was heroic only in a internal sense because I had a good reputation as a resident, you know I was already reinstating in the institute, I had no trouble getting another residency slot for the third year, I went to institute during a research actually, which was again of a child psychiatrist peculiar institution then. And got my third degree credits and so that was one of ways to deal a business certainly don’t tell anyone what you think, but there is actually Hungarian saying, which probably similar I think exit in other languages tell the truth and they'll bash in your head. You know tell the truth to power, telling truth to power has become an English thing so you can do that until you yourself have enough power to defend yourself and then I did not publish the “The Myth of Mental Illness” until after I had tenure, after I had tenure and I published of “The Myth of Mental Illness” the entire psychiatric establishment tried to defend me, calling paranoid, brought all kinds of actions within the university system to try to get rid of me, fortunately I had somebody by that time I was in Syracuse for quite a few years. I had to hire a lawyer and there was a subterranean, it was just under the surface before it hit to New York Times for some kind of academic infringements. Now again through the fact that there were lot of people in the medical school, debate essentially was in those days I mean you really have to replay psychiatric history as a reel power in American psychiatry then was not so much into American Psychiatric Association but in a few state hospital directors. This was still when the state hospitals had the money, they paid for the medical residency in most places, when I have started medical school well we have to pretty soon. So, no when I started medical school I mean this really is so old and in some ways so irrelevant to today except as a historical fact, there was no psychiatry department in the university of Cincinnati, where I went to medical school. There was no profession of psychiatry. It was a sub-department there too of neurology or something I think neurology and the only lectures, there were one or two lecturers given by the local state hospital director who would give and gives a usual garbage about schizophrenia and quotes the crazy people had to be locked up, that’s his best as I remember. So it was not very sure, so there was -- I was not sure where I was going with this point about Cincinnati and how excuse me. So well I had to hire a lawyer because you know I use ropes by then, and actually the department well I was comparing this to, sorry, I know since, when I went to Syracuse[ 01:14:25]that too was relatively even though it was much later, it was after I was drafted into Korean war and left Chicago in '46 — in '44, sorry in '54 and left to (inaudible ) in '56 I went to Syracuse. Now, there was no such thing as an upstate medical center, a state that was part of the State University of New York system, it became, it was originally a part of what is called Syracuse University. Now unless you are familiar with upstate New York terminology Syracuse University is a private university, on a campus, which is over inter digit you think practically, its sort of part of the medical school campus, it’s adjoining it and the state took over, the state systems, and expanded into '50s in the Rockefeller, which is now this gigantic system like in California. The medical school is Buffalo, in Albany, Downstate, Upstate at Syracuse. Was very small operation and most of the operation residents were paid for by the state hospital system and the meetings et cetera, the Department Chairman had their office was also -- the Department Chairman was also the head of the state hospital, which was in the same campus. Now this is local politics, but this is where the power was. And the state hospital — the New York State Hospital -- New York State Mental Hygiene department, which was one of the most powerful one, is a California one, you know this is also money. We are not talking about money and politics, now it's all under the federal government. This was old roughly -- in those days roughly 50% of state taxes supported mental health departments, essentially the poor crazy people. The state hospitals in New York City they were housing 10,000, 15,000 people in one hospital. You know, those were the golden days of state hospital called state hospital psychiatry. And again look at the terminology, state hospital. There was supposed to no such thing in America, supposed to be private enterprise, not in every state okay. But back to that, so Paul Hauck I mean this is wheels versus wheels Paul Hauck happened to be Hungarian Jew, who went to the same high school that I went to 30 years earlier, so did Franz Alexander go to the same school. This was a very distinguished kind of high school. You know, it was not so hard to get in but was hard to stay. So Paul Volker who was the protégé of Rockefeller who was the governor launched this attack with other hospital Directors and APA Szasz published "The Myth of Mental Illness" which proves that he is mentally unfit to teach students about psychiatry very logical argument, correct argument. The only problem is that this was not one of the grounds on which you could fire a tenure professor. 

01:18:10

01:18:15
THOMAS SZASZ This fellow, there is rubric of academic freedom and there are lots of people in the medical school faculty, physiology, anatomy and so on who -- two and two is four, it was just as obvious to them. This is fine, so I don't believe in mental illness, well they don't -- didn’t believe in mental illness, yeah. What doctor believes in mental illness, today of course they may believe in it because after 50 years you are brain washing, but in my days when I, for example, when I left my medical residence I was a very good terms, this was back in Cincinnati, I went back there for residency. I was in good terms with this people. I went to the Chairman. It was very distinguished university in those days in Midwest and I say to you, I am sorry I am not going to apply for another year because I am going to go into psychiatry. And you know what he said, I am not kidding you, I am not making this up. Tom, I am very sorry to hear that medicine is losing a good man. Now think of it, medicine is losing -- so he didn’t think it was medicine. Nobody saw it was medicine. The psychiatrist were the crazy doctors. You know, not far back as far my life is concerned it means nothing now to young people because this confusion between illness and mental illness has become extremely widespread in the western world, in particular in this country, also in England, Germany, I don’t know about the other countries, Hungary certainly. So it's all the same. And of course it was the use of drugs that proves it’s an illness. We are giving drugs. And you have the support of other people. Obviously I have an older brother who is very smart, smarter than I am and who always saw that I was -- this is correct, you just have to be careful. So it helps to be right to speak. I mean in some ways I feel you wont believe this, but I was the kind of herding to get The Myth of Mental Illness down into print because I really thought that someone else is going to publish this, because this is also obvious. But it was one of those things were you know you are saying something which you are not supposed to say and it still is that kind of a thing. You are not somehow not supposed to say it, but now it's of course the subject on which I still have one more book in me, which is in almost in print, not quite finished but 99% finished, which is called suicide prohibition. See now the taboo is not so much mental illness as such because there is more, except it wasn't as about it, but suicide is very similar now in America. It is equated with mental illness. It has such a thing as rational suicide, I proposed rational therapy and so. There was rational. If you meet you experts they all say that suicide is a symptom of mental illness, of depression. Fever is a symptom of infection and suicide is a symptom of depression, every text book you will see that right. So suicide is a illness. Obviously you want to live. Now that also has to do with our suffering. There are situations which suffering is perfectly appropriate. I was certainly suffering when I came to this country. I didn’t speak English, I felt depressed. How should I feel? As I say, it's common sense.
