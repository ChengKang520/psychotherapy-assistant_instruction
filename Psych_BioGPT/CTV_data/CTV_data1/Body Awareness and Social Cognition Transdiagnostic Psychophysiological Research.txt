DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER 

00:00:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S So the opening speaker is Wendy D'Andrea fairly recent post-talk from the Trauma Center who going on to keep for a long time and she was even before our time is up she's hired to New School. I was in the first year that she's there as a young professor she guest in RO1 to study, ah, kids and embodiment which isn't unheard of issue I wasn't surprise but, ah, because you not because in funny situation. So, ah, here's Wendy. 

00:00:35
Wendy D'Andrea, PH.D. 

00:00:40
WENDY D'ANDREA Thanks. I'd like to think that maybe you how are incredibly attuned and can tell how incredibly as I am. So you clap and start me up on a good foot. Uhm, I was, ah, wanted to mention that, ah, this is my 7th Trauma, ah, International Trauma Conference and, uhm, I first sort of began deciding that I really had to do post-talk at the Trauma Center about 7 years ago and I followed Bessel around and, and showed him my neuroscience data until he let me have a job. Uhm, so if you neuroscience data apparently that's a way in. Uhm, ah, I'd like to know who I'm talking to when I'm begin talking about things related to biology. Uhm, so if we could a quick what I'd like to call thermometer which is a film gage for how comfortable or uncomfortable you feel talking about, uhm, physiology and brain and stuff like that I know you're here but I what I get a sense for-- so how comfortable you are. So super comfortable not so sure, really uncomfortable. Okay, yeah, good. I try not to do too much over explaining, uhm, but if there any points of clarification on around designer methodology please let me know and otherwise will take that conceptual and fun questions after when all the group has gone. Okay. So, ah, I'm talking to you today, uhm, about body awareness and social cognition. And the way that I do my work tends to be with a trauma focus but trans diagnostically. Uhm, and I sort of, of the belief that people who have different diagnosis sometimes have much more in common than two individuals with the same diagnosis who very frequently may have nothing in common. Uhm, so that is, that is what I'm starting today. Uhm, and I'm, I'm starting with this quote which is something that a participant in one of my study said to me a few years ago, uhm, that my body is crime scene. And I wanted to sort of start with thinking for a minute what it means for your relationship with your body to think that your body isn't your body your body is a crime sin. And how that change-- changes your body from some-- from a home to an instrument. 

00:02:45
The Trauma and Affective Physiology Lab • Goals: - To understand how complex trauma is different - To understand the breadth and depth of the impact of trauma - To understand the interconnectedness of our capacities • Attention to threat responses, including • Interplay between relationship and awareness. 

00:02:45
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, even if it's an instrument for justice it's still an instrument which is outside of the self. So, uhm, wanna start people of what thinking about, just what that experiences like not that foreign or that no one hear everything about it. Uhm, I as Bessel said I'd work at the new school for Social Research in New York City and I ran a lab with, uhm, eight brilliant graduate students and a bevy of undergrads. Uhm, this is basically what we do, we want to understand how complex trauma is different. Uhm, we want to understand the breadth and depth of the impact of trauma. Uhm, and some of our work is inspired by trauma and also informed by trauma but isn't some ways more basic work on the human condition. Uhm , to understand the interconnectedness of our capacities are relational capacities are attention and cognitive capacities are capacities for creativity, uhm, are capacities for self- regulation. Uhm, I know where I am and so I know nobody here is going to feel terribly surprise that I think this thing are all interrelated processes. Uhm, but not everyone agrees with that yet so we're trying to provide some of the data that would support that notion. Uhm, we, we pay a lot of attention to threat reactivity. Uhm, though I think as a group we sort of take for granted, uhm, the, the freeze and submit responses of the fight-- flight free submit, uhm, options this of repertoire of threat responses. Actually the human data on that are terribly on the-- on the freeze and threat, ah, freeze and submit responses aren't terribly well flash out so we do some more come back which I'll show you a bit about today. Uhm, inter-- and we also do a lot of work right now on the interplay between social processes and self-awareness that's something that intrinsically interested in. Uhm, so, ah, a bit of a tour I'm gonna tell you guys a little bit about in basic biology just to be sure with more or less on the same page. Uhm, I'm also going to share some information from the, ah, the federally funded grant that Bessel mention. We're just finishing our first year so it is preliminary but it's narrowing data with the association and cause diagnosis so that's lot of fun for me. And, uhm, that I'll share some of our last, ah, the last piece of data that I'd like to share is from intervention, uhm, for kids and residential treatment. I'll speak a bit to the, uhm, intervention component but I will mostly wanna focus on how this kids demonstrate something about interrelated capacities. Okay. 

00:05:00
Our tools • Automatic Physiology - HR, Resp, RSA/HRV, muscle, temperature, movement • Eye-tracking and diotically and pupilometry • EEG/ERP • MRI (with Andrew Gerber, NYSPI/Columbia) 

00:05:05
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, our tools how we do all of these things we have a pretty flash out, uhm, physiology lab. Uhm, so I measure heart rate and respiration. And in we also seizure I will talk the acronyms RSA or HRV, uhm, these are, uhm, refer to respiratory sinus arrhythmia on heart rate variability which are measures of parasympathetic activity. Uhm, I can also mo-- measure muscle activity so that could something like an eye blink or it could be something like tension. Uhm, I have the capacity to measure body temperature and movement changes, oh, and the exciting part I haven't done anything with this yet but if anyone has any ideas I can do all of this diotically. So I can do these with two people at once were a new labs so we can do everything we want. We can do these for two people measure them at the same time and synchronized their data. So if anyone has any studies that like us to do let us know. Uhm, uhm, I can also do I tracking in pupilometry measuring changes in pupil, uhm, which tells you of somewhat is they that looking at what you have ask them to look at in the lab. Uhm, I do EEG and the ERP work which is brain reactions-- brain reactivity and I do collaborative work with Andrew Gerber at New York State Psychiatric Institute such Columbia, ah, using neuroimaging. So were, were gonna hit some of those things today. Okay, quick bio background, uhm, just to get everyone on the same page. Uhm, we-- in terms of the autonomic nervous system that my, my area of expertise in psychophysiology is really mostly with the autonomic nervous system. Uhm, the other technologist are new and exciting to me but this is where-- this is where I've sort of lived for a long time. Uhm, we measure the sympathetic nervous system is taught of the traditional fight or flight component of the nervous system. Uhm, it's also responsible we think of fight or flight because we are trauma people so that's where we go. Uhm, but it's also, uhm, a place a heavy role in the orienting response. And the orienting responses is not necessarily a fear response it's the noticing the before when it evaluates whether fear is necessary. Uhm, and we sometimes forgot that, that part of the, the sympathetic nervous system activity as well. At some degree of sympathetic arousal is necessary for ev-- for basic cognition. Uhm, there's the old, uhm, I think it's from this 30s, that your keys dots and curve, uhm, which basically describes that it mean some degree of arousal to be able to engage sympathetic arousal to be engage able to engage in task. So keep in mind that sympathetic activity is not all bad. Uhm, we, we mostly use what Landers(ph) response for this, uhm, are people think of sympathetic activity is related to heart rate but heart rate is actually influence by, uhm, sympathetic and parasympathetic so you can not necessarily tell what it mean what changes and it mean. Uhm, parasympathetically, uhm, we use like I said a respiratory sinus arrhythmia or HRV which are essentially synonyms. Uhm, and we that is a measure of moment to moment to changes in one heart rate. And so if you think about of this basically you, your heart rate changes really quickly to allow you to respond to your environment. So this parasympathetic system is much quicker, uhm, and it's much more a sort of attuned than responsive and changes on a much finer granularity. Uhm, so we are able to if something has-- if something in someone heart rate has change really, really fast we know that that's parasympathetically driven because sympathetic things don't work that fast but some of the dynamic it have to do within our underlying narrow chemistry. Uhm, parasympathetic activity it such neat measure because it underlies-- it seems to be related to everything good. Uhm, while we don't know a tone about what changes in parasympathetic activity mean we know that parasympathetic basic what we call parasympathetic or vagal tone. A high level of that seems to be related, uhm, to offers a good outcomes to be able their capacity to inhibit, uhm, inhibit attention, to focus, to inhibit anger and fear, uhm, to self-soothe, to engage relationally, to be responsive to the environment. It's a general measure of response flexibility and adaptivity, adaptivity to one's, uhm, to one's, ah, environments. Okay. Uhm, the other I'll talk-- I'll show a little bit of brain data today and just so the words are in your head if you're not familiar with them already. Uhm, you guys are probably all heard of the amygdala but I'm also going to talk about, uhm, the insular which is the brain that seems to be quite important, it brain regions that seems to be quite important, uhm, that you have mention before. Uhm, that's, ah, related to a sort of perception and body sort of body perception, uhm, so that's another part of the brain I'll talk about a bit later. Okay, And so a bit of background in what we think shutting down is like I mention a minute ago, we don't actually know as much about human shutting down responses as we sort of think we know. Uhm, most of the data available their actually come from animal models and the animal, uhm, data do terrible things like, uhm, scare mice until, uhm, until they have heart attacks. Uhm, I'll put them in water until they swim themselves to exhaustion. Uhm, and so we don't do that, uhm, in our lab, ah, but what we, ah, we do more, uhm, around of the acoustic startle response. And our framework for the acoustic startle response, uhm, comes out of some pretty basic emotion research. Uhm, and it's a sort of follows the model of Bruce Cuthbert whose name if you're following that in NIMH staff with RDoC all over that stuff. So this is he is someone who's been, uhm, really, uhm, instrumental and understanding shut down fear responses from, from the cardiovascular prospective. Okay, he talks about this model of what he calls the, the threat cascade. Uhm, what happens in the threat cascade is first the first element is what we start we assumed a, a baseline of calm which is an assumption. Uhm, and then people move to if you're following this, uhm, picture appear preencounter, uhm, meaning there is no stimulus prompting any sort of threat. Post encounter what they call freezing is what I prefer to call orienting but it's, uhm, a response that has a slight stillness to it. Uhm, but has moderate sympathetic increase and moderate parasympathetic decrease in the moderate range. So we expect an increase in heart rate in the one to four beats a minute range, uhm, due the changes in both sympathetic and parasympathetic influence so just a little bump if you-- if it's a minor fear response. Uhm, if it's, ah, if some as, uhm, threat proximity increases this is the component of the model that is a cascade that's threat proximity increases people's preparation action escalate as well. And so in order to be prepared to fight we think that needs awfully. Uhm, we think what needs to happen is that sympathetic activity needs to go up so that, uhm, people have enough blood flow, uhm, and all of that's there not bothered the sort of thinking about things they just are in doing mode. Uhm, their sympathetic activity goes up and their parasympathetic activity goes down. The parasympathetic nerves-- nervous system people also talk us as a sort-- talk about as a sort of break that keeps your body, uhm, essentially in check and you know, if you guys no resting heart rate, uhm, most the, the natural human resting heart rate is about 60 to 80 beats per minute. And if you remove the parasympathetic influence it tends to be over a 100 beats per minute. So parasympathetic nervous system is always sitting on your sympathetic nervous system. So that sort of mouse trap mouth model if threat approaches when the parasympathetic break is remove you can move forward and do what you need to do very quickly. Make sense? Okay. And, alright, ah, so we-- this is the sort of model that we assumed but it turns out that people who are anxious, uhm, the sort of garden, ah, variety anxiety, uhm, skip the whole orienting response. Uhm, their natural tendency or their base-- their, their default tendency is of something alert some it doesn't even have to be, ah, a scary stimulus it could be a click. Uhm, or we have, ah, a study that we did with attention and we had scary words on the screen and then in between its scary word we had just a dot for, for returning people attention to the screen. And our anxious folks were just scared of the dot as they were of the-- of the words like depth. Uhm, so, so people who are, are primed that these are folks who are sort of primed to be ready to go in their immediate response to even a low levels stimulus is this, is this threat response. But not surprisingly, uhm, complex trauma works differently. Uhm, and there some great work that's come out on this, uhm, looking at startle reactivity in complex trauma. And so this is Lisa M. McTeague's work, uhm, and what, what this is describing this is, uhm, a fear potentiated startle paradigm so their frightening words or sorry frightening images paired with startling sounds, uhm, versus neutral sounds and this is a sort of a degree to which adding fear on top of something already stressful. Uhm, leads to an increased, uhm, an increase startle response. Uhm, and so if you look at the column on the right and that describes the diagnostic categories. And, uhm, the high threshold on the left indica-- indicates a bigger startle response. So not surprisingly-- so wha-- what I think is really fascinating about this is on the left is PTSD we all think of PTSD classic PTSD is a fear disorder but if-- and that's-- that group is single incident PTSD single incident adulthood PTSD. If you look over on the right the pink tiny bar the, the group with by far the least reactivity in the startle paradigm is the complex trauma group. So those folks are less reactive and people with GAD, OCD, social phobia panic phobia specific phobia. Uhm, which really speaks to the idea that they are probably different mechanisms going on that underlying needs pathologist.

Startle Results: Heart Rate Deceleration 

00:14:10
WENDY D'ANDREA Okay. So what we are doing with this and I'm not gonna be label the startle data too much. Uhm, on the left is essential are measure of sympathetic activation overtime during a startle paradigm so we play 15 startling sounds not the first, third, middle-third and la-- last third. Now were as block one, block two, block three if you can see that. Uhm, on the right is basically out parasympathetic activity. Uhm, this sympathetic and parasympathetic things are determined based on like when in time we're looking at the changes in hurry. Uhm, so what we see, uhm, and were the circles are I didn't-- I don't want you to have to strained too hard to see others but were the circles are is basically the group who has multiple trauma exposure, uhm, that began before age sex and that features pre-- predominantly, uhm, PTSD with just so of set subtype. The other group without the circles there bluer lines there's a blue huge lines blue and purple. Uhm, that's the group who still has trauma exposure and still have PTSD. Uhm, but they don't have the association in their trauma began later in life. So what we see is this huge early, uhm, sort of moderate sympathetic response early on but really a huge parasympathetic response in people when we're startling them. Uhm, and the sympathetic response in the-- in the, uhm, I think what's interesting about the sympathetic response and the complex group is that it escalates dramatically overtime. Uhm, as supposed to the simple trauma or so-- sort of a cute, uhm, trauma group there-- they do show some of the habituation overtime and sympathetically the other group escalates. And a sort of think about what this would mean to have someone who, uhm, doesn't have much of, ah, response a mobilization response early on. Uhm, but shows really a quite significant mobilization response as the-- as the in this case sort of trauma and a log keeps going. So if you think about people who that like you might be trying to get a client you might be working with you might say something that you expect with having impact and it seems like it does in land and the client just sort of is none responsive or blink. And yet there's a huge response later. This is what I like to think of a sort of template for that experience. Okay, so what those threat reactivity have to do with body awareness and social cognition. Uhm, these, ah, the top left is meant to be a sort of social situation that we think of us evoking fear. The other one, the other images in the middle, uhm, are all creatures of various ages and species looking into to mirrors. And, uhm, someone, ah, a colleague of name (inaudible ) who does lovely body base work. Uhm, sad something recently that really struck me and he, he does work on interoception in body awareness and he said, that there is a key moment in our lives when we look into a mirror and we see someone who we know looking into the mirror with us. And that a sort of moment of coming to realized that we exist separate from someone else and that someone else can see us and that we have the capacity to see ourselves as well. And so, so a moment a sort of weaves together our capacity to integrate others awareness of us. Uhm, so what this-- what if, ah, body awareness have to do with social cognition? Uhm, well a model that were working with this really quite simple that there is something about threat and I we can all start and talk about why. And there something about threat that decreases body awareness it decreases sensory and that repeated a chronic threat, uhm, decreases sensory and emotional awareness, decrease connectivity in key areas of the brain that lead to a sensitive integrated, uhm, experience, decrease heart rate. And that relationship of decrease everything emotional in body seems to be have the reciprocal relationship with decrease social cognition. So, uhm, first will tackle the sort of threat side of this. Uhm, it-- it's to me and you guys all do trauma work but to, to the image that comes to mind to me when I think of why someone needs to shut down. Uhm, it's a sort of-- it's the type of experience that I think most kids have at least once in their life. Uhm, but some kids have over and over again. And so sort of have the image of a little kid, uhm, who has done something that they probably shouldn't have, uhm, and is, uhm, looking down because that's what we do when we feel ashamed or when we feel scare we look down. Uhm, and the parent who in their anger, uhm, shouts at the kid and look at me what I'm talking to you. And that's such intolerable situation, it's an absolutely impossible situation to-- when you're-- when you're 4 years old and someone is big and mad and yelling insisting that they look at you that you look at them when there in that state of raid is really an intolerable situation. And so what that prompts-- what-- that prompts in a sort of an immediate way is the need to retreat. Behavioral avoidance isn't-- has been eclipse the opportunity for that has been next. The kid isn't allowed to run to their room. The kid isn't allowed to look down, uhm, even there is a sort of eye gaze has being controlled by someone else. Uhm, but the, the intolerability doesn't go away so they have to so their internal self has to go. Uhm, and so it decrease in body awareness is the only way to decrease the stress for someone at that point in time. Uhm, we also we there some really great basic work that is demonstrating the reciprocal relationships between social cognition and body awareness. Uhm, and we see this were coming up most in empathy. So people who have better body awareness are more empathic. Uhm, two a degree and it also depends on how you to find empathy because empathy is a multi-dimensional construct. This empathy mean knowing what someone else is feeling. This empathy mean resonance. Uhm, but in terms of sort of broadly define empathy are ability to feel our body as really related to our ability to see someone else's experience. And this is work that has been done if you guys hold the mirror in your art work that is really related this out, uhm, in a nice theoretical way. Uhm, it also trans out that people who, uhm, a nice sort of paradox, if people who are generally purporting anxiety, uhm, actually have a very good interoception. Uhm, very good ability to feel what their body, uhm, is kind of telling them until you imposed any stress. At the moment any stress arises, uhm, that ability disappears that's a nice work coming out of, uhm, Hugo Critchley, uhm, Hugo Critchley lab that when you stress people interoceptive capacity disappears. Uhm, and the more anxious someone else the further they-- the more they lose their interoceptive capacity. Uhm, okay. Ah, before we go there I wanna just take a minute to, to give people-- to help people orient to what losing intero-- interoceptive capacity might feel like. Uhm, and, and, ah, I think didn't you-- do you define sort of interoception a bit earlier but we go-- I'm talking about the basic aware-- ability to feel one's body. uhm, we can talk about that as embodiment as well. But the feeling of one's body. Uhm, so if you can take a minute without moving at all or doing anything, uhm, just see if you can notice without moving it your left pinky toe. You don't have to respond and report back. Uhm, but, ah, it can be some people finds that (inaudible ) you mean, can I feel my left pinky toe, no. Uhm, other people find this the most obvious question in the world of course I can feel my left pinky toe. Uhm, and then maybe try pushing it down and your shoe if you can and see if that changes anything. Is it there now? Uhm, okay, another, another sort of quick way of that, ah, we've measure this and that we, uhm, have work with this. The way that meant interoception is often measured is, uhm, through a, a task called the heartbeat detection task. Uhm, in an heartbeat detection task gets really quite simple you ask people to say how fast they think their heart is beating. So it, uhm, the way that will do this if you guys can just sort of attuned to yourselves for a few seconds. Uhm, I'll set my timer, uhm, and just for 30 seconds noticed your rate. There's anyone able to feel the heartbeat without putting their hand over their heart? And could anyone guess that-- okay, so I give you some ranges, uhm, if your heart-- if you are guessing that you were you counted 15 to 20 heartbeats. Uhm, 20 to 30, 30 to 40 and 40 and up. So unless you're very excited, uhm, your heart rate of in 30 seconds your rate-- your heart should have beat, uhm, you know, half of what I mean in this so it should, you know, 30 times. I wasn't-- I wasn't, ah, counting my own heartbeat that's probably about 200 right now. And, ah, what are the way to stress our participants in the lab as mental arithmetic it's really cruel. Uhm, ah, but yes, so you, your heart should have beat about 30 times in 30 seconds, uhm, unless that you are either very athletic, uhm, or very, very excited. Uhm, so that sort of a sense of what we do with people in the lab and the two ways we do these one just is simply we put a timer on and ask him how many times people think their heartbeat. The other way that we do this is through a tapping task. Uhm, so we ask someone to tap every time they think their heartbeats. Welcome back to talking about that in just a second. Okay, so this is a sort of a sense of the things that were looking at. But anyway-- this so what happens with threat is the threat wipes out this ability to sense how it maybe in a good case some point. How fast your heart was beating. Uhm, okay. Uhm, so some data I wanna give as a sense of, uhm, some early data that we fold together to document what happens when people are losing some sort of sensation. These data specifically focus on external sensation. Uhm, so these are people who, uhm, there is a trans diagnostic sample, their, uhm, the top one, uhm, is depress to adolescence the bottom sample, uhm, is anxious adults, uhm, and this are-- this are sort of pilot preliminary data so the top one is about a line of 10 and the bottom is about a line of about 25. Uhm, so, uhm, the and then the, the two graphs on the outside those are graphs of, uhm, the association questionnaires. Uhm, and what we found was that folks who are prone to dissociation regardless of their diagnosis. We're showing, ah, we you know we wouldn't expect big amygdala activation. You wouldn't expect that their having a big fear response if they were the associating or at least there's a good argument to what I wouldn't expected. But what we found was actually quite interesting which was that their were showing decrease visual cortex activation and this is key if you know what the paradigm is the people are in the scanner and their looking at words that they have told us a couple of days and advance remind them of stuff that is upsetting for them. So they're not seeing it that process that I describe in the beginning of a kid who has to look someone threat-- threatening in the eye and have-- and wants to decrease that input this is what's happening let me-- or at least this could it be what's happening in that process. Visual, visual cortical activity is declining. Uhm, it's not the matter of-- it's not necessarily a matter of choice or will we don't know whether it's automatic or not but people visual input is decreasing. Uhm, the other sort of pilot finding that we have here and this, this graph doesn't really quite to do it just as on the degree by the way to which someone visual input decline was of corresponded quite nicely, uhm, to their dissociation course. Uhm, and the other thing that we thought was really interesting here is the sample happens to be a treatment sample. Uhm, and so we we've-- we are able to follow them overtime. Uhm, these are, uhm, I've, I've, I have a colleague at University of Pittsburgh who I mention more in a bit but I am recruit him a bit to, ah, I have recruited him travel land from his, uhm, sort of psychiatric world of depression and anxiety his name is Greg Siegle. Uhm, and so this was a cognitive therapy study and he was able to account pretty much completely for treatment failure in the cognitive therapy study by looking at people with lower in amygdala activity at base line. So across depression and anxiety if someone was going did not respond to cognitive therapy it was associated with having low amygdala activity at the beginning so you think about cognitive therapy which is all focus on sort of bringing someone down and bringing them in. Uhm, that's not what a substantial proportion of sa-- his sample needed. Uhm, and then in a low amygdala activity was accounted for but dissociation which was of course accounted for by trauma history. Uhm, so his we are able to sort of look at who in traditional therapist doesn't do well and there's not a surprise in the answer. Okay, so this is the grants but that leads into that Bessel mention a second ago. Uhm, so the, ah, (inaudible ) and this grant to myself and Greg Siegle whose that, ah, western psychiatric at University of Pittsburgh. And this grant is serve like, ah, I feel a serve my own sort of story of hope every once in a while because it's and NIMH does not have a great history of finding, uhm, despite the reason sort of claims, uhm, it doesn't have a great history of finding things across diagnosis, uhm, rather than looking it single diagnosis work. And it really has not had a great history of finding things related to dissociation and complex trauma. Uhm, but this grant got through, uhm, being explicitly dissociation in com-- ah, complex trauma grant. Uhm, so, uhm, the grant is called blunted and discordant affect, uhm, ah, ah, syndrome specifically complex trauma you can pars that for a second. Uhm, ah, ah, so and that-- what are paradigm is basic I'll give you quick, ah, interview quick orientation. We do the AAI, uhm, the adult attachment interview to look at fragmentation and narratives and attachment style. Uhm, the sched for diagnosis, uhm, the caps for PTSD syndrome-- ah, symptoms and the (inaudible ) dissociative of symptoms. Uhm, and all of the stuff we me-- we measure physiology while we do it. Uhm, a whole bunch of self-report stuff looking at (inaudible ) numbing and suppression, uhm, all sort of different stuff around sort of this construct of blunted and shut down our fact. Uhm, so that's two full days of assessment right there. And then our third of assessment, uhm, involve physiology task. Uhm, we used EEG aut-- autonomic data and cortisol and our task include the three social stress task. Uhm, the startle paradigm and something called that SRET. So the Trier, uhm, if you guys aren't familiar with it one part of the Trier is a mental arithmetic that I mention a second ago. Were you have people to serious attraction and then tell them every time they made a mistake. Uhm, it's terrible. Uhm, ah, and then the other thing that you we a-- you asked someone to do I think this is such we like it's a little, uhm, one of the other sort of barriers still work with complex trauma is that IRVs are really it has attend to have traumatized people upsetting things. So I'm sort of this is this is the next thing is an upsetting thing were we ask people to imagine the scenario where they have been accused of stealing something they haven't stole and then they have to make their defense to the judge. So I write their script and then read their script of making their defense and then we talking it wasn't good enough and they have to do it again. Uhm, it's really mean. Uhm, but if you wanna what when people shut down and you wanna do it in a way that doesn't actually pull them in to their trauma and this, in, ah, in, ah, clear way that's where we go with that. Uhm, the SRET the startle have describe before and it's just loud sounds to headphones. Uhm, the SRET is a cognitive task and it's, it's a complicated cognitive task. But what happens is then word a word appears on the screen and the word has been of unselected by the participant to be neutral positive, generally negative or specifically trauma related. Uhm, and above the word they don't have to do anything with the word. But above the word, uhm, they have to there's a series of digits and we have to sort the digits and put them in order. And so we look at just what that means to have that sort of affect present one people are trying to do something cognitive. And then our fourth day involves, uhm, task in the scanner again we do the startle and we do something the pulley task, uhm, this is, ah, work from Jill Pulley, uhm, and we ask people to tell us a memory of one someone gave you feedback both positive and negative. Uhm, as you guys can imagine all of our trauma folks have a really hard time with this, uhm, we originally the original holy task this is such a nightmare the original holy task called people's mothers and ask them to criticized them over the phone. Uhm, it so terrible, uhm, and but it was interesting the staff that would really freak people out this is an anecdote, uhm, I mean it's published data until all this work. But the stuff that would really freak for people out would not be the high grade criticism of like that really goes to the core but, uhm, the intrusive stuff like, uhm, a lot of this-- a lot of parents would describe things I call and then I hang up the phone because I just wanna know that she's home. In the scanner that totally blue people out of the water that sort of intrusive parenting. Uhm, so we, we don't call people parents parts because of lot our sample don't have parents. Uhm, or if they if we did call their parents staff they were they would say is not somewhere we wanna go. And so we ask them to pick a sort of, uhm, difficult, uhm, but not overly-- overwhelming a negative memory and a positive memory as well. The original design was please try to have them from the same person and not has proved to be impossible as well, uhm, people's family seem to be fragmented on that. We again don SRET scanner and we do gambling task in the scanner until look a reward processing. (inaudible ) is 150 patients half of whom have complex trauma that's not working out while he there. And because we have a lot of patients all of our patient have complex trauma. Uhm, but okay, uhm, and 50 healthy patients, uhm, from Pittsburgh Western Psychiatric the New School in Colombia. Uhm, this is one, one of the other things that unique about the study is that we have a very few exclusion criteria. Uhm, so we take who are suicidal and so on. 

00:32:00
Shutting Down as Transdiagnostic 

00:32:00
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, to anyone who can make it and his welcome. Uhm, so what we found so far with our first, uhm, sort of group of participants who have come in. What we've is look at just people whole brains. Uhm, and what you see along the bottom is, is people who have decrease reactivity. What you see along and so number of regions in which someone has decrease reactivity. On the right those are number of regions in which people have increase reactivity. So even though that the graph are the same size and now you can see that what's happening for the most part is our patients regardless of what are the diagnosis are so far. Uhm, are having major de-- major shut downs in their brain we are having shut down in their brain anywhere from 40 to 80 regions in their brain versus the increase activation which is much more selective. Uhm, the other thing that were-- if were if we move this to a stricter view and have even fewer part like sort of more look at the more extreme tales that, that relationship is, uhm, even more striking. But I'm wondering if anyone over on the right you'll see that one of our control participants actually has really high reactivity. Uhm, is anyone make any guesses about who that what kind of person that might be? 

00:33:05
A stricter view Decreased Connectivity 

00:33:10
WENDY D'ANDREA Their control so their none they have no diagnosis. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:33:25
WENDY D'ANDREA Okay, I tell you. Uhm, this is someone who has a complex trauma history that she didn't disclose in the initial screening. Uhm, but who has no symptoms and he-- and like AAI is clean all of our symptoms are clean. Uhm, so she in contrast to the patient who have really high reactivity who, who have really shutting down, she doesn't shut down but she reacts which is an interesting sort of thing in terms of like it actually what we are going for when we talk about calming down is that really our goal. Okay, so this is a li-- don't, uhm, try to read it's a kind of a blood bath. Uhm, but, uhm, I can tell you what it is about so this is looking at the, the digit sorting task I describe and in almost so what we found was decrease connectivity, uhm, especially in the trauma words, uhm, in so the, the serious decrease connectivity in the trauma words, uhm, and we found, uhm, sort of decrease activity all over all in looking at word type for trauma and for positive relative to neutral. What we actually found you know, that's kind of interesting that I'm, I'm really trace about we found really huge responses, uhm, for generally negative material. So what happen was we showed someone-- something that something that someone taught of us generally negative that a huge response we show them something that was traumatic and they shut down. And I think this actually incredibly important because I think what this means is that the system is not broken. Uhm, if someone can still have a response they still have the machinery to have a response. Okay. I'm gonna ask for, for that, uhm, we do the se-- analysis with a lot of sample I've already told you this, uhm, and I wanna-- then end with a little bit of data from kids and body awareness. Uhm, the other I should I didn't emphasized back there is that, uhm, we see a lot of this decrease connectivity particularly in the insular which is the area of the brain that I mention before. 

00:35:10
Body Awareness and Social Cognition in Youth The Doc Wayne Athletic League • Sports as a vehicle for self-regulation and empathy • Incorporates attachment and PCIT in a trauma-informed setting • Developed by Lou Bergholz, JRI, and the league Doc Wayne on the good Design • Goal: to examine whether league participation led to changes in targets of self and other awareness. • "Carnival" - Baseline autonomic physiology - Interoceptions task - Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RMET) - Self-report • attachment style 

00:35:15
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, alright, ah, body awareness in social cognition this is a sample of kids who are in the sports league called the Doc Wayne league. And then this is the sport league that uses attachment as a vehicle for self-regulation and empathy. Uhm, so it's something that uses an attachment focus and incorporates PCIT and this the developers are down there, uhm, and also here. Ah, the idea with that we use a carnival to collect data from kids and to look at their capacity for empathy and social cognition and how that was related to their interoception and physiological stress reactivity and so on and so forth. Uhm, so we had station set up in kids we go from station to station and get a price at each station after completing each task. And one's are focus on here are there, uhm, autonomic physiology, uhm, their interoception and their, uhm, and social cognition using a task called the reading the mind in the eyes task then to meet some questionnaire data as well. So this is the reading in the eyes task if you haven't seen it before. Uhm, people who have autism who tend to do quite poorly on this, uhm, and the ideas that you have to look at a series of pictu-- pictures like this and guess what or know, uhm, what the emotion is that the person feeling. 

00:36:20
The kids Baseline findings • HR: 39 to 130, mean of 86(sd = 15) • RMET: mean 3.3 (sd = 1.4, 1/3 scored less than chance) - Healthy norms: 70%, autistic adults: 50% • Interoception: about 40bpm off 

00:36:20
WENDY D'ANDREA Alright, uhm, so this is a sample of 38 kids these are kids who are largely in residential treatment. Uhm, mean age 16 a female, uhm, and our base my findings just I wanna sort of start about mentioning that their range of heart rate went from 39 to 130, uhm, so very little, little some have completely shut down heart rate and some have huge heart rates. Uhm, their scores on the reading the mind in the eyes task, uhm, this is a norm task, uhm, was about a 3.3, uhm, which means about a third of a samples scored more purely than chance. Uhm, an healthy norms is, ah, ah, this is a less than a 30% healthy norms tend to have, ah, ah, 70% score and people with autism have 50% score. So this sample with kids had less-- performed more fully on social cognition than adult with autism. Uhm, and their interoception rate was 40 beats per minute off, uhm, what we would expect for someone who can do interoceptive task decently. Uhm, the other thing that isn't really important here is that what all of stuff goes together even though I know we all believe and this are data that say it all goes together. Uhm, so parasympathetic activity was positively associated with social cognition and positively associated with interoception. And in terms of attachment, uhm, the ability to, to experience of being very distress by other people around you was something that was related to attachment, uhm, disorganization. 

00:37:45
Outcomes • Social cognition change - d = 0.6 • RSA change: - d = 0.91 • Within the task - Kids whose HR changed while tapping had be RMET 

00:37:45
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, people who kids who reported that they had worst attachment, ah, more avoid on attachment had lower capacity, uhm, for interoception and had lower respiratory sinus arrhythmia, ah, as well. Uhm, in terms of change just because I wanna present change to see don't things are hopeless. Uhm, kids-- these are kids who are involved in a-- in a intervention in a sports league, uhm, over the course of a couple months there a social cognition change quite nicely. Uhm, and there parasympathetic activity change as well. And this is relative to kids who weren't in the sport as well. Uhm, taken from another series of data this are there restraints this are some impress, uhm, data. Kids who are engaged in the sport also were less, less frequently restraints by their staff which are really key outcome. 

00:38:25
Intervention Summary • Integration of physiology, body awareness, and social cognition • Unusual baseline functioning • This can change with sensitive care! 

00:38:25
WENDY D'ANDREA Uhm, okay, so summary there all of these things are integrated they go together just what we think, uhm, and it's changeable. Okay, that's (inaudible ) message and, uhm, so I'd like to thank my lab which, uhm, I have this great bevy of grad students who does all sort of things, uhm, who the-- who brings all certificate of activity to lab. And so this is much their contribution, uhm, as it is mine well I acknowledge them. Alright, that's all guys, thanks. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN Alright, our next speaker is gonna Thomas Ross. Uhm, I met Thomas about 3 years ago when, ah, (inaudible ) through John Gruzelier in London, ah, recommended Thomas to do a post-talk with us in your feedback when we getting us started in the lab using their feedback and investigating it usually in your function MRI. Tomas is PH.D., ah, with John Gruzelier at Hammersmith in London. Then did a post-talk with us and he'll be presenting on this work today and then move on to (inaudible ) lab in Geneva his great mind in the field and I think he'll really in lightness on your feedback and your plasticity. 

00:39:30
Tomas Ros, Ph.D. "I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky; Then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of being a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am a man? -Chuang Tzi 

00:39:35
TOMAS ROS Okay, so hello everyone and thank you to Bessel for inviting me. Ah, it's, ah, great pleasure to be among such an eclectic mix of speakers. Ah, and today as you can see on monitor I talk about, ah, neurofeedback, ah, maybe some of you are already familiar with technique. but before I move on to the actual nitty-gritty of your feedback I would like to introduced, uhm, the basics of the brain, ah, relate to basically the rational for using your feedback, ah, for treatment. So I wanna begin with the quote, (inaudible ) that, ah, demonstrates how essential the dreaming is in it to construct reality. And, uhm, the main common denominator between, uhm, dreamt states and the waking state is very difficult to, ah, determine, so the biology in the-- in the mind is very difficult to invent the biologist that the brain is the common denominator. So that, ah, really so demonstrates that the brain is construct on reality and, ah, we could somehow modulates, uhm, our perception of reality by much letting brain states. So I hope in this talk that I will be able to show you in the big picture because, ah, it's easy to get lost in the small circuits of the brain and there's many different approach just from the all the way down to the microstructural level to neuroimaging which involves the big brain. So, uhm, I hope that will follow it up instead of peeling the onion from the outside I hope to and show you and build it up from the inside. And that the starting point is the plastic brain. I'm sure you've already heard that how many times, uhm, but actually what is it that makes a plastic. And, uhm, why is it plastic I mean the question is, it's been referred to as plastic but, uhm, in, in plastic really means that you know, the property of plastic is that you can shape it any mold or form. And actually the same cases of brain but with plastic you would usually to change its form you need some kind of intervention on it. So you would maybe need some temperature increase to melt the plastic. And then after you set within the right shape you decrease temperature in the plastic we set that temperature. So with the similar knowledge toward the brain you could change the brain but why is it that essentially changes the brain, ah, it's more or less its own activity. So you could look at it's on neuroactivity has the temperature that's being raised in the brain to put things very simply. 

00:42:10
the synapse electrical chemical electrical 

00:42:10
TOMAS ROS Ah, so this, ah, schematic of the neuroactivity at the synapse. And the quote are very familiar but I just wanna sort of reentry this, ah, so that we are clear on a to move forward basically. The three types of, ah, three types of, ah, transmission one is electrical and the other is chemical. And the synapse is basic-- basically the conjunction of those two. So the electric-- electrical pulse arise the synapse which is the junks of between neurons and then it, it releases, ah, viscous, synaptic viscous that you see in green there, they are actually chemical and that take cross a border from synapse and create another pulse of electricity on the other side. So that's the real core of the onion which the brain is made from although is constituents. And the actual, uhm, firing right of this for synapse determines, uhm, what constitutes in neurocircuit and, uhm, how this neurons are connected. So to give you a brief example of neuro plasticity in action this is a nice study that has been done on the cortical neurons, ah, as they developing you can see at the bottom there's hours there it speed it up but you can see how quickly and how beautifully this neurons sign up to each other in almost, uhm, over, over days but it actually a very fluid (inaudible ). They're searching other so you can see the cell bodies they're actually not changing so in most mature brains the is the actual connections that are changing all the time but, ah, the number of cell unless there in particular areas did not change. So this schematic, ah, summary of, ah, different post of brain but this-- but this they are all intersect in time. Although the function will changes can occur early on which is means that the, the type of firing neuro, neuro cells can change and that leads to chemical changes in the synaptic receptors that then can also lead to structural changes in the brain what matter which is basically the myelin, ah, and what the neuron, neuro, ah, neuro, neuro, you know, branches are made from. So this is kind of, ah, self , ah, reinforcing loop between the function of the brain and how it changes its own structure. 

00:44:25
Many windows, one brain 

00:44:25
TOMAS ROS And, ah, we can investigate this type of placidity, ah, with different, ah, a sort of neuroimaging techniques more invasively because in humans it's prohibited so, uhm, on the top is CEG there imagery with electrical and can functional, ah, measures of brain activity. Then we go to FMRI which is more accurate in terms of localization but a bit slower in terms of time. Then, ah, pets which is, ah, there trans neuro transmitters binding of the different receptors and then anatomy is basically the white matter and the green matter. So looking-- depending on which when there you used you might think different things about the brain. But essentially all six windows give view on to one type of brain so we have to be careful how we interpret it so we get a holistic picture of that what the brain is actually doing. So at the very, ah, reductionist, ah, level which would be the single neuron I just wanna give you a brief, ah, video of that. So here you would, ah, a change in neuro firing. So this is a video of a neuron that you can hear but its firing at a particular frequency but a particular rate. Then once you depolarize this neuron which means you activate it starts to burst. So has basically two sets activity. Ah, and this bursting can also lead to different changes and plasticity which is call long term potentiation. So depending on the schematic strength of the, ah, onto the neuron that determines its firing rate. Ah, this is another example of functional plasticity which, uhm, occurs after behavioral intervention of stress so can stress on a-- on a rat. 

00:46:00
Functional plasticity Ghosh et. al • Stress and Amygdala 

00:46:05
TOMAS ROS And you can see here, ah, beginning-- before the stress there is a certain type of frequency contents of this neurons that are recorded in the amygdala and which is kind of the fear circuit part of the fear circuit. And then after chronic, chronic stress this, ah, immediately after the, the neuro cir-- far are much more in this, ah, higher frequencies than a little bit less but this, ah, this, ah, picture is actually long lasting so even 10 days after stress still presents so that's, ah, demonstrates that, ah, that the imprint of the-- of the intervention was lasting. And if there is no stress and actually basically the, the neurons go back to baseline. Ah, so even if you practice this certain of behavioral task like it say, ah, visual, visual, ah, perceptual learning which is associating them for stimuli, uhm, when you get better out it you can actually detect those changes in the brain post, ah, intervention post training. And, ah, you can detect changes in connectivity between them from regions so even at resting rate which is basically spontaneous activity the brain-- the resting state has some changes, ah, that generalized after the training. Ah, so as, as we said the bli-- the brain is constantly changing it's changing shape and changing, uhm, activity. 

00:47:20
Chemical plasticity Changes in Cortical Dopamine Receptor Binding Associated with Cognitive Training 

00:47:20
TOMAS ROS And here's the one way example of chemical plasticity which we mention at this-- another window into the brain which is the number of receptors that the synapse. Here there was an increase in dopamine receptor, uhm, ah, ah, binding actually with patterns it's a decrease in dopamine which means that when you give the radio trace you increases the, the bind-- uhm, and such the amount of binding it means that endogenous, ah, quantity was actually elevate so you have a decrease in binding. But basically it means that there is more dopamine in the system after this type of training in the particular brain areas. And, ah, lastly there's, ah, also, uhm, changes in structural plasticity so, ah, for that this is, ah, good result because of the topic of our workshop so I put it in and (inaudible ) practice leads to a changes in green matter than which basically it means the, the number of a neurons, ah, how strong the in the present in the-- in the cortical green matter. So this is hippocampus of brain area which is involve in memory and navigation. 

00:48:20
Is the brain like a computer? • Software = Functional activity • Hardware = Structural architecture Brain = Wetware Software = hardware Brain function = Brain structure 

00:48:25
TOMAS ROS So that leads to question is the brain like a computer? And actually it's a little bit like a computer but it was differs very much from computer. Ah, you could, you know, reduce it to fact that a computer has software running which would be its function activity, the programs it runs and the hardware is actually the structure of the CPO that the basically the connection between the wires the transistors. But actually in the brain it's more like, ah, by the directional link between soft and hardware. So brain function influences brain structure and vice versa. So if you have, ah, lesion in the brain structure basically you have an effect in the brain function. And also if you have a changes in brain function you can also influence brain structure its more technically wetware. So I hope that, that's a big picture wanted to start with to show you that actually the brain is plastic fantastic. And, uhm, that lead also to the plastic paradox so although it's great that the brain is plastic it has its positive it has frozen cons basically. So the positive is that we can maybe enhance or restore brain activity after it's, ah, being damage and a good example of that are meditation and also, ah, just natural, ah, recovery brain function after like stroke during brain injury. Ah, but also there are negative effects, uhm, which means that you know, falling trauma example the brain can enter a different plasticity states that will, ah, compromise its functional optimal function basically. So it also, ah, is quite common in addiction that, ah, because of tolerance the brain can get used to certain drug and then once, uhm, you take it the drug away it there's withdraw symptoms because the this brain is erected in, ah, plastic manner to the-- to the addiction. So that's the question then how to guide this neuro plasticity, ah, to make things better in patients? Ah, and I come back to the same slide and I want to underline that one window into this whole, uhm, modulation of the brain is to, ah, basically modulate the brain function directly. Ah, and to do-- and to control anything you require feedback so that's why we come the neuro feedback aspect. Uhm, ah, basically for example if you wanna to control your, uhm, navigational direction you would, ah, look at the compass and you would have a north and every time you would bear off the north you would have feedback for the compassing you're going a little bit more of south. So you would used the north as a reference and the feedback would occur continuously so that you were able to maintain that direction so, so there you have control of your direction but you need feedback. And it's the same with, uhm, for example cross control on your car. And the feedback, uhm, because of three, ah, uhm, sort of, uhm, different mechanisms. Ah, three different stages one is the sensing stage where the parameter that you wanna control is sense followed by a body or by a an engineering system. There's a computation that allows it to compare that to reference value that you want to maintain. And then there's the action that changes the parameter so in cross control you have a sensor for the speed then you have a sensor that compares the se-- the speed with the reference that you wanted say 60 miles per hour. And then you-- the, the car would increase the speed if its, ah, below that's speed or decreases speed of its about to speed. So the interest-- the important point is that actually for any type of control you need to have observation of that parameter. There's no way you can control the speed of car unless you know exactly the speed and know you the speed. There's no way you, you can control the car if you know the power of the engine. You have to have a direct access to the parameter. So in essence that is the rational for using your feedback that you get feedback from the parameter that you want to modulate in the brain. Now unless you have feedback of that parameter control is very difficult especially in a none healthy brain. Uhm, so here, uhm, basically that's the summary for that it access a mirror so you see the brain activation, ah, on the computer screen and that allows you to learn to control it. 

00:52:45
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) 

00:52:45
TOMAS ROS So here's the simple, ah, example of brain computer interface control in, ah, ah, primates. Ah, the primates gets, ah, basically, uhm, bring it was being recorded from the Skype and then they going to computer the computer processes the data. This place in real time on a-- on a-- on a monitor and, ah, the monkeys able to learn the association what is supposed to be done by his a neurons and how to control different aspects in the script. And here's another example of more modern primates doing the they called the none human pri-- oh, yeah, now their humans but their primates in the-- in the scientific literature. So, uhm, this is a set of that what you would use on your feedback, uhm, ah, that now a days you know, you have flat screen as a set. So, ah, this an example on your feedback screen so basically on the left you have the actual, ah, real time value of that parameter that you want to control so in this case, ah, were looking at EG. And the you can see there it's called alpha amplitude so it's basically the amount of synchronization of a particular brain wave in the brain. And, ah, there's a reference study in which you consider the person to-- try somebody to keep it above or below that value. Ah, and then there's another type of visuals it of stimulus that is more entertaining that will keep to the present of attention and that, that they will also core modulate with the real connectivity so basically the, the (inaudible ) would decrease or increase in size with the real time value that brain activity to me. And the aim would here would be for example to either keep the alpha below ascend threshold and or above ascend threshold. And the idea is that particular brain path and his brain with patterns indicates in brain states so you would basically ask the person to maintain it particular brain state for, uhm, an amount of time and would co-- would occur with great plasticity. So, ah, this is just another example of a therapist client like a screen so you can see here on the left again this EEG there it's been unless the real time you can select different parameters and there's a client screening which basically we just see a game and maybe, ah, a real time sort of aspect of the game for example here the bar would indicate, ah, when, when the alpha was very high the bar will very high and then the space will move forward and when the alpha be very little the space will pull back. Uhm, so that bring associated to the physiology of what were actually control-- controlling so EEG is one type of feedback we can used there's also FMRI on your feedback. Ah, but my specialization is in EEG so run for that. Ah, in EEG we're actually directly recording the synapse activity and there's, there some potentials that occur of the synapse is basically the frequency in which the, the synapse is in fire. And you can record that from the scalp. 

00:55:40
EEG and behavioral states 

00:55:40
TOMAS ROS And they also a correlate with different behavioral states. So you can see here those beat activity this are been basically named in, in the-- in the order that they was discovered. Ah, and for example very slow activities are related to more, uhm, a lower arousal states and high-- fast activities-- fast of frequency are related to more, more information processing. And this just a general kind of, uhm, schematic but this gets a little bit complicated so for example that was in the past, ah, how then as EEG. Now you can analyze EEG topographically so here's an example of looking at the topography of EEG, ah, on the bottom, uhm, figure and also the whole frequency content of the EEG, ah, in time. So here you have frequency on the Y axis in time and the X axis and this is actually study about loss of consciousness and you can see clearly like that the fast of frequency is decrease and then start to isolate particularly in this alpha rhythm in the frontal area of the brain when you give propofol. So, uhm, all of these patterns could be theoretically modulates it's, ah, in the waking states. Uhm, I'm not sure if you would increase alpha some of-- some, some, ah, alpha studies have been correlated with (inaudible ) of states and so and so. 

00:56:56
Electroencephalogram signatures of loss and recovery of consciousness from propofol How to study brain plasticity non-invasively? 

00:56:56
TOMAS ROS We don't have to time to cover all of those but actually today I just want to introduced and validate this methods so it's more like a proof of concept, uhm, I'm talking and then Ruth is gonna follow up with some patient data well with techniques in PTSD. So I, I was involve on some early studies to actually validate this technique which means to show some kind of evidence, ah, that actually this technique is not just, uhm, basically our create of imagination but it has some impact on the brain. So, ah, how to do that we used to TMS which is transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess changes in, ah, most of excitability in the brain. And the way you can do that is you stimulate the motor cortex with magnet at a very particular strength. And, ah, you can record the muscle activity at the bottom of the arm when you-- when you stimulate the motor cortex with the pulse. And this is the trisynaptic root so it stimulate here magnetically that it activates the axons in the-- in the motor cortex that's sound a signal pulse down to the spinal cord and then there's another, uhm, path way to the-- to the muscle to the neuro muscle injunction. And then here in this neuro muscle injunction you just using electric you can record this motor evoke potential which basically strength the construction of that muscle and that's very precise. So if you keep the strength of activation constant here and you give intervention and what you record here at bottom could be related to the intervention for example if you give drug like, uhm, (inaudible ) usually inhibits cortical function therefore the MEP would decrease in size after a medication. And what we showed actually that we had an experimental time line where we took measurements of this motor of potentials and we did neurofeedback just for one, ah, one session which is 30 minutes long and we recorded directly afterwards in the first 15 minutes and 25 minutes after the intervention. So we wanna to look at the real direct cortex can you actually detect changes in brain function immediately after your feedback is some of your feedback of course is you know, take up to 15, 20 sessions even more. But it if this changes accumulate and there must be some kind of changes or discrete after each, ah, each session. So that's why we wanted to look for and actually we found an increase and excitability at around 20 minutes after. So arou-- if will just in arousal effect it will be more here and there then there will be a decrease so actually this goes against that infiltration will also had another group that did a different propofol that didn't show the same signature. And, ah, even more compellingly basically we found, ah, a correlation between how will you train your alpha which is your (inaudible ) efficient and the change in the motor by potentials so basically the one should decrease the alpha the most, ah, the greatest, ah, excitability increase. So I just want to also talk about alpha because maybe you don't know how is related to cortical function. But alpha is an inhibitor of the wave that, uhm, the brain generates when it wants to, ah, shut down the certain brain area. So increasing alpha would basically decrease the cor-- the cortical stability that's what you can see here for positive train coefficients and for negative training coefficients actually increases excitability so it's sort of opening the, the connection between the motor cortex and the muscle. You-- actually with that conforming the actual movement. So it directly, uhm, taking the activity from the motor cortex and we didn't give them any behavioral sort of strategy they just learn to do it by themselves. And, ah, actually there is also relationship between changes during the session and changes in the resting state and changes in the motor of potential. So it's a triangular relationship which means that the training EEG, ah, actually has impact on the resting EEG afterwards in the direction in the positive direction. So if you train negati-- if you train decrease alpha the alpha will be lower in the resting state later on and that will be then correlated so the changes in (inaudible ). Your starting off with, uhm, a task which changes the functional activity of the brain that then generalizes the resting state and then that resting state has impact on the excitability of, of the-- of the circuit. And to show you another example of this long term which is, uhm, basically I made this study where they gave many sessions and they look at changes in the EEG score here on Y axis and changes in the theta whether the goes they were down regulating. A theta, ah, rhythm that is predominantly at EEG in one type of subtype. Uhm, and they've ask the children over 20 sessions to decrease this beat of rhythm and they found a, a connection between change in the theta over preimpose 20 sessions later, ah, with EEG scores. So again it chose to generalized instability of, of that pattern across time instability of that pattern overtime. Ah, one more study just recently came out, ah, showing what matter changes after neuro feedback. So saw changes in the functional, ah, aspect of a neuro feedback but you know does it last even longer to actually change the structure of the brain. So that's why I was introducing those concepts and actually there is the evidence that it generalizes to actual mat-- what might attracts in the brain. So the other question is can your feedback modulate particular circuits in the brain that are related to, to behavior. So in the motor cortex does just one circuit. We wanted to see whether similar intervention would, ah, modulate functional networks. And, ah, to give you a brief introduction of some functional networks in the brain that have been associated with certain a behavioral function. It's quite a few but the main let say 10 or these and you've already heard about the default mode this morning which is great because, ah, it's basically, ah, ah, related to, uhm, thinking about the self where any self-related activity like, uhm, autobio-- autobiographical recall and planning. And usually, ah, when you activate this a network you divorced the sensory area from, from activities so which means basically that as you activate the internal, uhm, cognition that you actually need to deactivate the sensory areas that are, uhm, involve in external attention of the environment and you can do that even yourself but in experiment of you just look at this class here and I ask you to calculate 36 and 24 you will least conscious is it the class during that period it's maybe for split second if you know exactly the answer of it. But calculating that number, ah, your brain cannot do two things at once. So it's costly shifting the activation of these networks and sometimes these networks, ah, working (inaudible ) sometimes they work competitively so as I said default mode usually activates when sensory area are deactivated and sensory area are activated and the default mode might goes down. So actually here's another example of this-- this just more summarized, uhm, so we were wondering whether you can change this to default mode. And I just tell an anecdote that actually, ah, before it came to Ros lab, ah, I was experimenting with a bit of myself and, uhm, I was looking at the EEG when I was doing a mindfulness and I found that actually the alpha rhythm would decrease in a amplitude when I would be thinking about nothing were concentrating or focusing very much on something external in the world. And I thought that was a curious finding and thought maybe you know, you could train this rhythm to change the proportion of, ah, external versus internal attention. And actually afterwards they came out with a study that was, ah, I think simultaneously, ah, recording of EEG within FMRI they found, ah, a positive connection between changes in alpha in real time and changes in this default mode. So in essence by decreasing alpha rhythms you would be decreasing default mode not-- and not connectivity. And here another study that, ah, shows a ratio between default mode and mind-wandering they already mention by they did it clear, uhm, sort of thought sampling, ah, study where they look at, ah, changes in, ah, sort of ta-- task and related thoughts during attention task and, ah, the more reports they had on mind wondering the task more of this networks where activated and during the task.

Mind-wandering and default mode network Simultaneously EEG-FMRI 

01:05:40
TOMAS ROS So, ah, there's already clear correlation there between mind-wandering and default mode. So that comes to our study that I did with Professor Lanius, uhm, in London Ontario which we called mind over chatter because we also found a relationship with, ah, cask on related thoughts and to cut through all the text I'll just show you pictures. So here some pictures of what we did we, ah, down regulated the alpha rhythm at the pro site, ah, one of the areas were its maximum and we have two groups one was the real neurofeedback and the other one was post-neurofeedback. Post-neurofeedback is basically free recorded EEG activity from a real neurofeedback group but obviously we replate(ph) it to a different person so it had no relationship to, to the brain activity in real time. So it's gonna bogus EEG for somebody else. And we wanted to look at we did a single a similar scenario as the team study with took the MRI before the neurofeedback then we gave neurofeedback for 30 minutes and then we read, read the same MRI again, ah, during the MRI we actually gave them a task where they would listen to different beeps and during they, they have to indicate a long beep every so often. And we also had a telephone ring which would ask them what you mind wondering for example thinking about something else like shopping or whatever or we actually cause ringing the beeps. So that gave us the quantity of, uhm, task in related thoughts during the session. Ah, so this is just the result for the alpha, uhm, group, ah, versus the SHAM so the alpha amplitude, ah, decrease significantly, ah, during the neurofeedback so each of this period is basically of 3 minutes its last for half an hour and we have a resting state EEG before and after. Ah, and you can see clearly the EEG drops in the amplitudes, ah, significantly putting your feedback group and this are people who did neurofeedback before. There was neurofeedback (inaudible ). In fact when we ask them okay, how did you control this amplitude this were actually I focus and did not pay attention to the space, ah, spaceship and it was very easy I let it very quickly.

EEG topography during neurofeedback 

01:07:50
TOMAS ROS So they were getting feedback every half a second about the SHAM group they had initial drop probably looking for strategy and then slowly because there was nothing-- can you see between the feedback and the real brain activity they went up and you can see what's the study of deviation and variability of the of its much higher. So that's the EEG picture, ah, also of the topography then you can see this was a feedback site there's a minimum here where the alpha was down regulated and for the SHAM group it was an access point there's of differences was on the beat of topography a little bit. And the first thing we found that there's this relationship post-neurofeedback immediately post which is basically after it's kind of plastic effect. But in the scanner they, ah, neurofeedback group, ah, patients they demonstrated less mind-wandering for those subject that they had the greatest decreases in alpha that's the positive correlation on the top. And, and also the SHAM group didn't show such an effect so actually there was no plasticity effect they are, uhm, no relationship with, with alpha so interesting that, ah, they didn't show that, ah, correlation. The other we found was we replicated the neurofeedback with TMS results that, ah, there's a positive correlation being changes in alpha during your feedback and post-neurofeedback so actually the rest is they changes where in the direction of the training changes. And, ah, first some we found that actually that's not the case in SHAM group so some SHAM group subjects did decrease their alpha during their SHAM feedback but it did not translate, ah, in any positive way or negative way to changes in the resting state. So unless you push the brain to do something there was seem there wasn't an imprint of that particular signature in the EEG, ah, after training. This is half an hour so half an hour later you can actually imprint different changes, ah, in the EEG, ah, and different brain state. 

01:09:50
DEFAULT MODE NETWORK CORRELATIONS SALIENCE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY CHANGE 

01:09:50
TOMAS ROS And then we look at the MRI picture so, ah, this is the ICA components which is the basically the component of the core modulation of the default mode the co-- core activation of this regions that have a particular topography, ah, you can see that default mode and, ah, here we found a positive correlation with mind-wandering as the other, uhm, studies have shown in the past so basically the more mind-wandering the more precordial activity which is one of the mode in the default mode. And actually the more alpha they presented so if you look at the flips I basically means that less hour for they have the less default mode and connectivity and also the less mind-wander. In the SHAM group demonstrated the same effect that, ah, actually we didn't find the mean effect of the default mode isn't just a correlations. The on ewe did find, ah, as a group mean that was increase was, ah, activation of another, uhm, sort of co-- uhm, and so what word the competing network so this was the task positive network which we found the salience network and this network has been a involve in basically external attention and, ah, maintaining of task set. Ah, so you can see here is time one time to so for the neurofeedback group they have much higher connectivity increase here and then this are the regions of interest where is actually higher and the SHAM group did not demonstrating changes. So this is 20 minutes after one session in neurofeedback. 

01:11:25
Top-Down Regulation of Default Mode Activity in Spatial Visual Attention 

01:11:25
TOMAS ROS And, ah, just recently, ah, ah, another paper came out showing the interplay between this two networks so in blue you have the default mode notes and in right you have the salience network. And I'm actually show that this two that was are competitive and once you activate one you have to deactivate the other so that's similar to our neurofeedback data where salience network was activated which improves behavior in (inaudible ) function which decrease mind-wandering. And where's-- when you activate the default mode you degrade behavior or at least potential behavior. And so in line with the, the topic of the workshop and other, ah, mindfulness stress reduction and training study which use exactly the same measure as we did in terms of brain connectivity so evolution looking at the same pictures before and after so-- before and after on your feedback. Now were looking before and after mindfulness but over a longer course of treatment and actually they used to see their salience network. And, ah, this are the mindfulness group and the control group and the difference after the training they have this increase in dorsal, anterior cingulate the same region that you see here. So this two intervention seems to overlap at least in cortical activation. And you see here there's a decrease of the default modes over default mode network which is the, the precuneus and the, the PCC, the pres-- uhm, Posterior Cingulate Cortex. So actually they are very similar to this alpha dam cortical. There's a course other changes but if you think of all the changes that, that could have been there just to, to already overlaps so it's quite interesting.

What are the advantages of EEG neurofeedback? 

01:13:05
TOMAS ROS Uhm, so I wanna close before we takes over I've shows you the PTSD data with what are the advantages of using this methods, uhm, compared to some other methods? Uhm, I think the first thing is the safety of it so because you're just training the brain with your own brain activity, uhm, it will does to try more sessions but it's safer because you're not, ah, introducing any external electromagnetic fields or anything like that which are not intriguing to the brain. So that's, ah, that's a very big plus. Uhm, the second is the efficacy, ah, have some data showing here for example that this effects that we found with TMS were actually on power with the TMS effects so this will be TMS effect here for those of you who know that you can use also TMS to stimulate the brain competitively. Uhm, and, uhm, also the cost is quite low now you can get some very cheat on your feedback units. And the long term stability this is we haven't talk about which is an important issue, ah, which means you know what I mention in the (inaudible ) transforming the brain from within. So I think one of the advantages that you, you not changing, changing the brain from the outside so you don't allow to change to the brain to response to the treatment as a reflects but you're actually asking the brain to create the change from within by itself. And that means that you could minimized hours effects for example that you from drugs. Because as soon you introduced the drugs from the outside the brain respond but at this time you're actually asking the brain to do-- to do the work from inside and, and, ah, here's some examples of, ah, the fact that if you used other low natural interventions you can also have very rare but sometimes quite serious, ah, side effects which have not been reported as yet when your feedback for example seizure in the patient this patient that was, ah, stimulated by magnetic simulation or, uhm, I also hypomania induction with transcranial direct current stimulation. And, ah, basically now in the internet you, you can see a lot of this device as becoming cheap and of course we are not advocating for their use just yet because that means to be researched. Ah, but you can imagine that you know, you could walk into clinic and try to control your brain waves within in within a particular brain states. The, the big issue and the hardest part is to find those relationship of the brain state and behavior I'm also part of physiology so were at the very early stages of, of deciphering those, ah, relationships but I think with enough time we could use this, uhm, sort of methods and as a group of concept, ah, I think it works. So now, the question is how does it relates to brain and behavior? How does it relates to mindfulness, ah, that move-- before on to study to determine but I hope to continue to doing this kind of work in the future. And just the last by this showing you that for those children who were doing your feedback for autism the effects is actually will stable after 12 months so this shows evidence that actually once you train the brain it can maintain this type of, ah, level of performance even the 12 months later without any other training. Thank you very much.
