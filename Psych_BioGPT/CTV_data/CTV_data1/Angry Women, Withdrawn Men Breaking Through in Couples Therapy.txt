RICH SIMON Welcome.This is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and this is our webcast series, Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. We will discuss a range of issues in this series: secrets, affairs, and talking honestly about sex. And the, uh, uh, politics of infidelity. Um, volatility in the sessions, and today we are going to be looking at the classic, the maybe, the most classic challenge of couples therapy, almost to the point where it's become a cliché. The, that is the angry woman and the withdrawn man being dragged unwillingly into psychotherapy, into couples therapy. And we are f-fortunate to have with us as our guest, uh, and this is a first time ever for me. I've never interviewed a family member, uh, much less my wife in a Networker webcast series. But in my humble estimation, I'd like to introduce to you, the best couples therapist in the entire world, the distinguished clinician, Jette Simon. Jette, it's good to, I haven't seen you in a while. How are you doing. 

00:01:35
JETTE SIMON Great, uh, this is fun, Rich. Thank you for inviting me. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON So, um, let's, let's start off and let's, let's just phrase this. There are all kinds of exceptions to this pattern, as we know. Uh, it's a gross simplification, but if there is a single image that, uh, most of us have, uh, particularly people who have done couples therapy have of the challenge of couples therapy. It is the wife, she's angry, she's fed up, she's, she's tried over and over again to make some changes in the relationship. Nothing works. And somehow or other, she's managed to get the unwilling husband, she's dragged him into that first session, and there they are sitting in your office. You have somebody who's very intensely engaged, and, uh, and, and, maybe really actively quite angry, and then you have somebody who is remote and isn't quite, isn't, isn't quite present. When that kind of couple comes in, again, it's not the only kind of couple that comes in, but if that k-kind of couple comes in, how do you begin to work with a couple like that. 

00:02:50
JETTE SIMON Okay. Yeah, I mean, that, that's a great question. First of all, uh, I before the couple comes in, I think about, uh, how to focus myself. How to ground myself, how to be centered with those two very different energies. And then, um, I want to give them a warm welcome and I want them to have a different experience than what they have at home. And, I want them to feel safe in my office and give them some hope that this pattern can change. So, um, what that means in the first session is that for the one that comes in expressing the anger, maximizing the energy, for me to help that person feel safe, I really need to connect with her and make sure that she feels safe for the, for the partner who attempts to minimize the energy and might come across as more withdrawn. For that person to feel safe, I need to give that person some space. So I'll be aware of not asking too many questions, initially. So, that's just like maybe the first four minutes. I'll welcome them. I'll try to be very predictable for them, so I'll tell them what's gonna happen in the session. And that in itself seems to calm both systems. 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON How does this, so, so, just tell us how this sounds. So what are the kinds of things that you'll say at the very beginning of a session that begins to set in motion this culture for change. 

00:04:45
JETTE SIMON Right. So, I might say, I don't know much about you, but what I make up about you is that your relationship is so important to you, and that's why you're coming here today. My job is to create a space where you really can share honestly what is going on in the inside. And, um, what we will, uh, what I will help you with here is to bridge, create a bridge between those two experiences and helping you begin to make sense of why is my partner criticizing me or whatever it is. And why is my partner withdrawing. And, uh, we will work slowly, uh, towards getting to what is really going on between the two of you. So, that might be an initial statement. 

00:05:50
RICH SIMON Okay. And so, a-and then what, so as you work with them, what information are you looking for. So you're framing the therapy in a certain way, and you're giving them some general expectations. What is it that you, what are you looking for from them. 

00:06:10
JETTE SIMON Right. Right. Well, I'm both looking for, uh, the 80 percent that I think is already good in the relationship, that's actually working well. I'm looking for what is this couples' strength, and I get that information through having them talk about what brought them together in the first place. What did they actually fall in love with. And that part, in itself, I think, is a surprise for the couple that, you know, that I as a therapist actually would spend quite some time focusing on what did you fall in love with. What did you admire about each other. Um, and adore and as you got to know each other even more 24 years ago, what is it that you came to love about each other. And so it's like my assumption is that there might be the 20 percent that hijacked the 80 percent that's actually still there but doesn't really, uh, have a life. Uh, and, um, then I'm looking for what is the hurt, what is the fear that is really fueling this dynamic between the two of them. So, how I get to that is having them share what is it they think they contribute. What is it they think they do. What is their behavior that they imagine actually causes their partner some painful feelings. 

00:07:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:07:50
JETTE SIMON Hurts the other. So and, and that surprises them too because they often will come in having lready prepared a speech about how bad the other person is. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Sure. Yeah. 

00:08:05
JETTE SIMON So, often they'll say to me, did, did you mean what I'm doing. You, you meant what she's doing, right. And I'll say no. Let's hold it with, what are some of the behaviors that you sometimes have. So we're moving away from generalized language into sometimes instead of always, that you sometimes have that you think is hard for your wife. And, so I invite them to share three different behaviors. Shift. I have the partner share the same. And all of a sudden it's like their, the system is beginning to rebalance, uh, and, then we move from are there any other behaviors that you would like to add that from time to time is causing you pain. So we're moving you away from that it's the, that you are bad, to it's the behavior that's causing a disconnection. 

00:09:10
RICH SIMON So, let me, hon, hold on just a second. Let me just understand this. So, as, as far as the, uh, so you're asking them the behaviors. You're asking them what is the behaviors they're doing that they think their partner has difficulty with. Is, is that… 

00:09:25
JETTE SIMON You got it. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON …the behavior you're referring to. Okay. And, and, and what do you, so that's an interesting question. So, and what happens with how do they, d-do people somehow, sometimes resist that question. Especially people as you said earlier who were ready to make their indictment. How do you get them to shift mental set, they're all ready to accuse their partner of creating all of this havoc in the relationship and then you're asking them to own up to their contribution to it. Does… 

00:10:00
JETTE SIMON Yeah. So… 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON How do you, how do you pull that one off. 

00:10:00
JETTE SIMON Yeah. The one that maximizes might sometimes have a hard time here saying, you know, wait, wait a minute. I want to tell what happened yesterday. What he did. And, um, what I say is, hold on, this is also, I mean, that's very important. We really want to hear that story, too. And if you could just put that in the parking lot, I'll begin to introduce the metaphor parking lot. Can you put that in the parking lot just for now, and then we'll come back to it. Uh, and, most of the time when they feel I take that seriously and have respect around what was that caused them pain, uh, they can do that. And, uh, if not, then we would have to kind of take a circle and say okay. Let's just hear that story and let me see if I'm getting it. That yesterday he was late again, you waited half an hour, he had promised to be on time, and there you were again completely alone, right. Am I getting you. And they will say yes. And this happens a lot. And you validate that, that's hard. Right. That's hard, and you look at the other partner and say that would be hard for most people. Right. Good. And then you move back into, and any other behaviors that you imagine you sometimes have that would cause your partner some pain. Or, when he's late and you begin to feel this aloneness, you sometimes react by. And there you get the maximizing behavior. So, well, then I attack it. 

00:12:10
RICH SIMON So, i-i-if in a first session. So you, so partly we have your, you focus people immediately on early stages of the relationships, on the positive. You try not to move, uh, into the, into the indictment into the problem-saturated statements too early. You have, the first part of it is, uh, i-is kind of shift the mood. And then at some point, once you've done that, once you've got a sense of people's initial attraction to each other, then you begin to move into some of the rel-, the struggle in the relationship by reversing it before you get, uh, before you ask people to, uh, own how they might be responsible for some provocation before they get into their, any kinds of accusations and the, and the blaming of each other. Is, is that, uh, am I following that one so far. 

00:13:05
JETTE SIMON Yes. So, what I'll do is, I will, uh, validate their action and say, you know, it makes sense that you withdraw when you feel criticized. I mean, that just happens. So, you withdraw in order to protect yourself and maybe possibly to protect, uh, the relationship so that the conflict doesn't escalate. And it's fascinating that your withdraw pattern is exactly what's going to be part of the drama escalating, because the more you withdraw, the more she, your partner, will maximize. And so then I go over to her and say, and that absolutely makes sense. Of course, the more you perceive that he's not there. You know, your husband, who's the most important man in the world. Of course your body, your nervous system will tell you to maximize the energy in order to connect. So, it's like, when they begin to get the more I, the more my partner does, and that gets validated, it's like you normalize the dance, you normalize the dynamic and, uh, it helps people come a little bit out of this feeling that something is wrong with them, or a feeling of isolation. Um, and, um, so in the first session, we might then choose for each person, uh, one specific topic that triggers them. And we'll begin to move just a few steps into what are the underlying deeper emotions that are part of the behav-, the very behavior that causes the disconnect. 

00:15:15
RICH SIMON So, so say a little bit more. So how, how might that work. So, give, give us, maybe again, if you can help us unders-, how might that sound. What is it, what are the kind of things you might zero in on. 

00:15:30
JETTE SIMON Right. Right. So, I mean, if we think about you and I and one of, uh, uh, the of the behaviors that at times could trigger me, was, I mean, if you were 10 minutes late, my nervous system would get triggered. Whereas, I imagine for your nervous system, if I was 10 minutes late, you could feel, oh, that's great. I have a little more time for myself. So, I might in the session say, uh, so let's say we start with the person that's withdrawing, which is, a, a stabilizing thing to do for the couple. So if this therapist, instead of focusing on the maximizer, turn over to the one that withdraws, minimizes and ask permission to go into what is it that really triggers you. That person might say, well, it really triggers me when I get criticized. Okay. And when you get criticized, what happens inside of you, I mean, do you get tense. What happens on the inside and for the person that withdraws the therapist needs to help them with words. And often you don't wanna go into a feeling sentence, but moving to a [0017:05]body experience. So, do you tense up on the inside. Yeah, I get tense. Okay. And sometimes I get a headache. Okay, so, you get tense, you might feel pain in your head and then you react by, well, then I go to my office, I sit behind my computer, I withdraw. Okay. Well, that certainly makes sense. And the next stage might be, I withdraw in order to get what. I mean, what's the payoff of withdrawing. What are you getting by withdrawing that you can't seem to get when you're with her. So he might say, well, just some 00:18:00]space. Just some space where I can be myself. Um, where I can begin to relax. Okay. So, the payoff is you find yourself again, you can relax, you get some space. And, again, that's very easy to validate. So the therapist, in a way, becomes a, uh, a model for the partner. And the partner really, it's like they tilt their head a little bit when we do this piece of work, like, what. Yeah, I mean, that does make sense. Uh, that when he gets triggered, that's what he experienced. Then, of course, you know… 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON The understanding. As you're, as you're tracking that, at least maybe the, the cases that are more, more conducive to early change that's uh, that's a partner may really get with what you're creating there. The validation process that you're leading. 

00:19:00
JETTE SIMON Right. And, you know, as, uh, the one that withdraws now is beginning to step out and share. Well, guess what happens with the one that maximizes. He will begin to calm down. And some will say, gosh, I never thought about it this way. I never got this. So, in essence, they're beginning to get that it's not that the withdrawn partner doesn't love his wife. Actually, she's very, very important to him. Their relationship is very important. That person actually wants connection. Um, and so you slowly begin to shift so that both people, uh, can move into becoming a team around these patterns. So, in the first session, I might, might not go any further than that with the withdrawer. And then I'll move over to the, uh, the, um, the woman who comes across as angry. Uh, and I might start out with her asking her to just notice, uh, what touched her on the inside as she listened to her partner. And, next to that also make room for what at times is very hard for her. And the way that I might validate the maximizer is to help her see and him see that her anger is really a protest against feeling disconnected. So, it's like the maximizer will use that kind of behavior to get connection. Because any connection is better than nothing. So when they both begin to get that beneath anger, or that anger as a protest against feeling deeply connected, they begin to see also that's how important I am. I'm so important that she will actually do, um, uh, all of this in order to get my attention. And… 

00:21:35
RICH SIMON So, stay with that for a second, hon. In this, in this, uh, in this first session, um, do you find that at, at this stage, that it happens. This is the nightmare I think to the beginners couples therapist, the couple will start their battle with each other. And it just does, they can't, they can't bring it under control. The therapist can't. Is that something that you experience these days. And with couples who push up against that limit and, and who are, don't respond to the kind of tructure that we've been talking about up to this point, what do you want, what do you find yourself doing. 

00:22:20
JETTE SIMON Right. Well, two things. It depends on how extreme their reactivity is. So, I try. Well, the {00:22:35]first thing I'm saying, telling myself, is remember now Jette. Don't work too hard right now. They do the work. Because ometimes what will happen here is that the therapist will begin to maximize their energy. So, instead, I might start out 00:22:55]saying, wow. Hold on here. Raise my voice a little bit. What's happening right now is really important. And am I etting you right, that this has happened before. Right, that you feel very differently about this topic right now. Is, is, is that right. o, I might bring it up to kind of a meta level and say what is that like for the two of you when you feel so differently about a 00:23:30]topic. So that's one way of moving in. Sometimes when the rupture is more extreme and they really, uh, get loud, I lean back in my chair, take a couple of deep breath, and I remind myself that this won't last very long. And then I love in when there's a pause and I say, thank you. What just happened here, I imagine that's what happens at home. And thank you for showing me. Now I really get how painful this is. And am I getting this, that this is very painful for both of you. And they will nod. Let's talk about that. So, the last thing you want to do is to move too much into content. because that's where they are stuck, and that's where the therapist gets stuck. So, again, I try, you know, my job is to 00:24:50]validate the experience and then try to move in, back into process. And, uh, when it escalates, you know, to me, that's all a sign that they're really missing each other. They're longing to connect, but that there might be a part inside ach one of them that's also very fearful of connecting because connecting might bring up both sweet and painful memories of losing the connection again. So, I might say, am I getting it that there's a part of you that longs to connect, and then there's a part in you that also says don't go there, because something bad will happen right after. And don't get your hopes up that this will be a good experience. 

00:25:50
RICH SIMON So, uh, t-try to understand this and so you're trained as an imago therapist. And so the hallmark of an imago is, of course, this dialogue process. What you've described so far I, I don't hear the dialogue yet. Maybe I've missed it or we jumped over that. What I've heard in this first session is you're quite engaged with each partner. And you're, that's, that most of the action is there. So where is, what's the role of the imago dialogue, the mirroring and the, the validating between the partners. We've talked mainly here about your validating people's behaviors. 

00:26:30
JETTE SIMON Yeah. Yeah, so here, I mean, we talked about the more extreme couples and I think it's important that they connect to me, uh, that there's some attachment happening between the couple and me. And in the first session, I might only [0026:50]have them mirror positives, and might invite them only to mirror what they appreciate in each other. I might have them mirror in the end of the session what they liked about the session. Uh, but mainly, I might, uh, do the mirroring, the summary mirroring, uh, and certainly the validation, uh, and also and at times I'll begin to bring in feeling words to help them experience empathy both for themselves and the other. Um, so, in the first session we're really just establishing a connection. They get a feel for how I work. They, um, then, after the first session, that's the time where they have now to decide whether they want to commit to therapy. And that's when we move into deeper emotions, and when the time is right, I will have them moving to, um, mirroring and validating the other person's experience so that they begin to get a felt experience of being understood by the other person. 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON Okay. So, early on in the first session, particularly if there's volatility, you're more active. There's, you're, there's less of the mirroring, there's, there's less of the, the dialoguing within the couple. 

00:28:30
JETTE SIMON You got it. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Okay. Alright. Now, go ahead. 

00:28:35
JETTE SIMON Yeah, because, you know, as they see how I work, it's, that helps them, um, feel safer. And from my perspective, that's needed because before we really get into getting curious about each other. So that's kind of the next step of therapy is exploring, exploration, what is really going on, what are you really trying to get from each other. And a big part part of the therapy is exploring their worlds, see how they have changed since they first met 24 years ago, and then helping them move into a, you know, a more , what we call more differentiated and integrated, uh, relationship where they have a clear identity. Uh, and can begin to feel competent around dealing with conflicts outside my office. So it's not the absence of conflict that's a sign the couple is doing well, but it's how they deal with conflicts at home. How they can repair, um, the hurt that will, uh, actually tell me how fast this couple is, uh, is, uh, moving ahead. 

00:30:00
RICH SIMON So, so your hope, so let's, we're staying with this initial session. What, at the end of a first session, what is your hope about what's been accomplished. What's the, what kind of, what's the kind of information that you, that you've gotten that's important and m-maybe, m-maybe that's a l-little, or maybe that's a lot. and from the viewpoint of the couple, what experientially, what is it that you would have hoped, at the end of a first session, that they've experienced that you think is important in getting therapy off on the right track. 

00:30:35
JETTE SIMON Right. Well, first of all I want them to really remember why they found each other. And, uh, I want them to, uh, know that it's not who they are at their core that's the issue, but it's their behaviors that, uh, is causing disconnect. And I want them to, I hope that they will get that their behaviors are fueled by fear. And that eventually it will get to understand what the fear is about. And I hope that they, through the validation, uh, can begin to get maybe a little more empathy for themselves, and for the other. Um, and that, um, they have made enough of a safe connection with me, that motivates them to continue their work. And that they've gotten that this journey, this, the couples therapy is a very intentional journey. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Say, well, say more about that. It's an intentional journey. What is an intentional journey. 

00:32:00
JETTE SIMON That we will actually even talk about what is their intention. I mean, what kind of partner do you want to become. What's your vision for a good partner, and a good partnership. And that, uh, by beginning to get clear about their intentions, and, um, allowing, a-a-and establishing a a contract with me that if we don't follow that intention, I can actually call them on it. So, my intention, she might say, is to never shame you again. Okay. Okay, so, and my intention is to not criticize you. And if that happens in the session, I want to have a contract with the couple where I can say, let's just pause it here. Something just happened that moved the two of you further away from each other. Let's see in what way are you not staying you're your intention, right now. That might be an example. 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON That's, uh, so say a little more about these contracts that, uh, what point do you begin to make, uh, contracts with each of the partners about their behavior. 

00:33:25
JETTE SIMON Yeah. Okay. So… 

00:33:25
RICH SIMON And how, just the mechanics of that. What did the, mechanics of, how do you make a contract with each of them about, a-a-and, uh, wh-what, what determines what these contracts are. 

00:33:45
JETTE SIMON Right. So after the first session, I want them to think about first of all making the commitment to therapy. And then in the next session when they come back, we will address that so having thought about making, having made the commitment to therapy, what's your intention. What are you really wanting to see happen for yourself. So that might be how I will start it. And what's your vision for what kind of a partner you want to become. We write this down and, uh, and, you know, and then we hear from the other partner. So, part of the growth is reclaiming some behaviors that will actually bring more passion, more aliveness, uh, into the relationship. And, uh, we will continue to address whether we're moving in the right direction. Are we still under contract or has the contract changed. So, after each session, the couples will actually do a piece of writing on what they learned or relearned, uh, and, you know, are we moving in the right, uh, direction. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON S-S-So have you, but you mentioned before they have a contract, so this contract, for example, you mentioned shame. A wife shaming her husband. So, what's the form of this contract. Who's this contract with and wh-, in a concrete way, what place do we have, uh, i-in some cases, do you have, in every case do you have a contract with the couple. What determines what these behaviors are. How, how elaborate do these contracts become. 

00:35:55
JETTE SIMON Well, actually as you move more and more into therapy, the couples will move into what we call behavior change requests, dialogues, and w-what happens there is the person will begin to see what emotions are fueling their behaviors. And beginning to connect that emotion to their needs. And from the need we'll begin to look at what is the longing. And from the longing, we can go two ways. We can either have the person who has the longing ask for a behavior change request from the contract, that will, uh, have the partner move into needing the other's needs. Or, I might have the person, him or herself, give themselves a behavior change request. Meaning, what can I do that will make it more likely that I will get from my partner what I, what I'm longing for. So, the contract might be around trying out new behaviors, and checking on that and seeing if it doesn't happen, that's just in information in terms of what emotions are getting in the way of you actually stepping into the very behaviors that will make it more likely that you will have your needs met. So that would be an example. Was that clear enough. 

00:37:45
RICH SIMON S-S-So. S-S-S-So, the work of the therapy, the, um, the process of change, these, this, these, these, these, how much of this is represented explicitly in these, in the contracts. So if I were to read the specific contract that you might have with, with each cou0ple you have a contract. Or they have a contract with each other, I suppose. Um, i-i-in what you're describing. And does that, that explicit contract, does that get, in your viewpoint in terms of what's the leverage for change, what guides the process. Is it expressed in these contracts. Is, wh-wh-what, how important are these contracts in, uh, in giving the, in the giving the therapy its direction and it's concrete focus. 

00:38:35
JETTE SIMON You know, I actually think it's quite important like a couple I worked with today. Where is in her contract she says, I really, she's been quite withdrawn. Here it's actually the wife who's been withdrawn. Uh, she, she, at some point in their relationship she was the maximize but then she gave up hope that he was ever going to be there for her, and they both live this withdrawn life for years. In her contract, she puts it this way, I, I love my husband. I know I want to reach out for him. Intellectually I know he's going to be there now. And emotionally, there's a part of me that still has a hard time trusting that. But my contract is to, over time, learn to reach out for him and have him comfort me. So, I mean, that's very important information and very important for me to remember and to ask how is it going with that. So since we saw each other last, what was an experience where you reached and he was there, and what was an experience where you felt the impulse to reach but didn't do it. Keep exploring it. 

00:40:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So that gives a, a structure to the therapy that you can come back to again and again. Gives, gives it, gives, you can stand back from it and describe. There's an agreed-upon agenda, I suppose, for the therapy. So, as a trainer you're describing this, how you get this process started in the early sessions and the s-s-structure. What do you find as someone who does a lot of couples training. What do, what do couples therapists find hardest about applying this model that you've been describing for us. 

00:40:45
JETTE SIMON Um, you know. I think well, with this dance where, uh, one comes in as angry and the other very withdrawn. Uh, what I often watch on the videotape, because all my trainees, you know, they have to videotape their work, is that they get pulled in by the maximize. And that's, and they get pulled, or they get pulled into content. And, um, to what degree that happens is often related to the therapist's own, own story. And so we're work with helping the therapist, um, get grounded have them try to go against what they feel like doing, moving over to the one that minimizes. Help them do that. Help them train the specific steps of moving their attention over there. And, uh, help them become predictable as a therapist for both people so they might say, I might train them in saying to the maximizer, I know there's a lot you want to talk about, and I will be back. But I'm just going to go over to your husband for a little bit. Just seeing what is going, what is going on for him and then we'll come back to you. So it's training the therapist to become predictable for the couple. Sharing what are the steps. And, uh, risking going against what, you know, their, uh, feelings tells them to do. So, that's, that's one way of working with it. Another piece is… 

00:42:45
RICH SIMON S-S-Stay with that for just a moment. So when you said predictable, uh, say a little bit more about that. They're, your, that they can become more predictable for the couple. As opposed to, to or maybe you can give us an example what you mean by becoming more predictable. 

00:43:05
JETTE SIMON So, right. So, it's like, let's say, they are, uh, connected to the one that's maximizing. And then all of a sudden they just move over to the other person without letting the maximize know that this is what they're doing. 

00:43:25
R ICH SIMON So making an explicit statement of how they're, of, of, uh, how they're, what, what they're doing, how they're all-allocating their attention in the session, what's their intention behind a certain move in the therapy. A certain kind of behavior or intervention. 

00:43:45
JETTE SIMON Right. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:50
JETTE SIMON Exactly. And, uh, another great, great tool for the therapist is the therapist's own emotion. ]00:44:00]And if you can begin to see that whatever you are experiencing as a therapist, uh, is often a mirror of what is going on between the couple. And then using that emotion, bringing that into the space between them is also a way of freeing yourself as a therapist. So moving back into process, using the emotion, checking that out if that's what's going on. Uh, with the couple. So an example might be sitting with a couple but they're not saying anything. And you're feeling this tension on the inside. And using that as to say, I don't know about you, but do you feel some tension right now. They probably will say yes. Could you each share what is the tension about for you. And then the other person will go over the bridge, mirror the experience of the other partner and you're back into process. So it's using whatever goes on on the inside of the therapist. Bringing that back into the space, checking out with the couple. If there's something to whatever you're experiencing. And have them begin to dialogue about it. 

00:45:30
RICH SIMON And when it's great, um, we know, when the couple picks up on this. What happens when they don't, and it's just that your response and, and what's your experience in dealing with that kind of a situation. 

00:45:45
JETTE SIMON Well then I might say, okay. This is not a truth. Uh, you, uh, we're just using this to kind of, you know, it's like a wall you play up against so it's not tension. Instead, what you're experiencing right now is, well, I, I'm angry. Okay, let's go with that. So it's important that the therapist, uh, isn't coming across as a truth-teller, but giving it as a suggestion uh, as a, um, as a, uh, you know, as a board we can play up against and see what else is, might be going on for the couple. 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON And so this, you've been. You've been doing this for a while. You've, you've, you've been, what is it, 28 years of doing couples therapy. 

00:46:40
JETTE SIMON I think it's 30 by now. 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON 30 years of couples therapy. What's, what do you personally find most challenging about doing this work. 

00:46:50
JETTE SIMON I, you know, um, I think what's at times is challenging for me, which I'm sure has a lot to do with my own story, is when you have two people that both have withdrawn. And you feel this sense of hopelessness, and carelessness, and you hear this big part in each of them that's given up hope that they can ever find each other again. That at times, uh, is a very challenging situation. And often there has been so many moments when they haven't been there for each other and moments when the other really needed the person to be there. And you know, I know my own story, I mean ,I know why this can happen in particular. Um, uh, soft spot. Uh, so w-w-when I would begin to feel, uh, kind of the energy leaving my body, I know I need to do something else. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON And. So-So how, uh, how do you deal with the challenge. So, here you have these, uh, th-th-the couple there, s-so they're uh, th-they're not engaged with each other. They're inwardly, it seems like they've, as far as you can tell, they've given up on the relationship, but they're still coming to see you. So where do you go with it. Wh-What sorts of things do you say or do with couples such as this. 

00:48:40
JETTE SIMON If you watch my tape 10 years ago, you would see how I kind of would try to talk them out of the whole business. If you watch my tapes today, you would see what I do now is I amplify the pain. I might say… 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON That's interesting. 

00:49:00
JETTE SIMON This is such a hard place right now. What a painful place this is. This is really, really a raw spot, right now. Uh, and I might say, I don't know about you but is this a very, very lonely place to live right now. And they would begin to, yeah. 

00:49:25
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:49:30
JETTE SIMON So, it's almost like you find hope by amplifying the pain. So it's almost like nobody had really seen how painful this is. How, what a lonely place this relationship is. Um, and, like one man when I did that he said, yeah. The other day, my wife talked about how our neighbor's child needed more care from his parents. And I felt tears coming to my eyes because I'm still that little boy. I need more care. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:10
JETTE SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:15
RICH SIMON One, one thing I wanted us to get to, has to do with something you and I, if only, and we have, we have about five minutes here. Uh, say a little bit about this. So, you and I have done couples weekends over the last several years. And, uh, one of the things that we have really in that context of, uh, a couples weekend, of oh, a dozen couples coming together for two days, and going through a number of these, the, these, uh, dialogues drawn from imago therapy and helping people to discover a new way to talk to each other. One of the things we've really begun to do is talk about, uh, find a way to talk about the, the male, this, this wh-what we'd call this anger shame cycle. Uh, and I'm wondering maybe you could say a little bit about that and the application of that and the kind of work you do when you just see a couple whether this is in that uh particular way of addressing some of the different gender experiences people have as, is really, um, particular to a couple's weekend or how you've involved that, how you're able to apply that when you work with just a couple. But begin with one, say a little bit about this anger shame cycle and what, how that, the role that plays with couples. 

00:51:40
JETTE SIMON Yeah. You know, um, I think that where, when the wife gets that part of her creates some shame, is when the man feels that he can't protect her, or can't make her happy. And that underneath the shame, there is this fear of I'm never going to have a happy wife. I'm never, I don't know what to do. Um, one guy he used this metaphor of my, I feel like my wife is standing in a castle fighting dragons all alone and I'm on the outside of the wall really wanting to help but I have no idea of how to do that. And instead, he moves into this shame stage. He withdraws, but underneath is tremendous fear of losing her. And as she heard that and began to get that he wanted the relationship too, something shifted. And there was a softening that happened for her. So, and, you know, I'm thinking about, I mean, one of the things that you do at the couples workshop that is so helpful, is when, for both men and women, is when you begin to talk about, um, change. And, um, so, I mean, but what you experience, Rich, when you do this, when you think about the couples workshop. 

00:53:20
RICH SIMON Well, it's always great to, you, you have to have your wife on the show in order to get interviewed, apparently. So this is great. Thanks, hon. Nice, nice to be occasionally asked a question in these webcasts. The, what I would say, just underlying what you're just talking about, is this, uh, whole dimension change is not part of the, the language, typically, of couples therapy, or often enough, psychotherapy. One of the things, and both of us have, uh, talked about this a lot and in the context of a group of couples together, these kind of common experiences emerge and get, get clear. So this quality that we've, we've been labeling from, uh, the premise of our conversation here is you have angry women, withdrawn men, and why are the men so withdrawn. Why are they so reined in. Is it just, that's how men are. Or, that's how they're, they've been trained to be in a relationship. One of the things that, that together you and I have started discussing and opening up the possibility within these couples groups, is that when a woman is unhappy with her husband, for whatever reason, and she gets angry with him, what it triggers, you earlier talked about this protest against disconnection. That's her experience. The male experience, a typical male experience, is to feel like you are a failure. You are less than, m-m-my wife is angry, unhappy, I must have failed as a man in some significant way. And the, the part of the inner experience of men that isn't often drawn in to the couples dialogue is this experience of what a shameful thing I have done or not done. What a shameful failure I am as a man, because I have an unhappy wife. The response to shame is, a very primitive emotion, is to withdraw. To shut down. I am, I am, uh, an inadequate human being. I don't belong in the community of man. And so one part of this experience of the withdrawn man is this experience of a deep shame that men often don't acknowledge even to themselves. So one of the things that happens is that when we begin to even use the term shame in our couples group, it's a curious experience, isn't it. 

00:56:00
JETTE SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Just to look, to see the look on people's faces. Th-, the, the person who I really credit with helping me understand this is David Wexler, who's written for the magazine. He wrote the, the, uh, the cover in an issue called The Secret World of Men. So shame, I think, is the great secret of the male psychology, and is a particular, is a secret in, in couples relationships. Often it's hard to get the addict when you just have that single couple in the office and you've described this for me. When we have it in the couples group it's really curious what happens. And that the women seem to be, to get it, even more than the men do. Do you have that experience, that the, something goes on and the women connect the dots. Oh, that's what's going on with him. When suddenly I can't reach him anymore. Is, you, you, why don't you say a little bit about what, how you perceive that. Wh-What do you pick up on when we begin these, try to explore that in the couples groups. 

00:57:05
JETTE SIMON Yeah. You know, uh, you know you're absolutely right. I'm always surprised too. There's a kind of a smile on the, the, on the women's face when talk about this. And, what I make up about it is that they begin to get how important they are. That really. He really wants to protect me. He wants me to be happy. Um, it, it, it's like such an eye-opener. And I think that part of what happens when this shame gets on, uh, addressed, is that that's when people move on to exits, affairs and, um, and they, they go somewhere else to find aliveness and passion. Um, and so I think a lot of times, exits, affairs, whatever, comes out of these particular fears not being addressed in couples therapy. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON And that, as you're this, you know, the thing that occurs to me about this is that, um, once you supply a term, shame. Once you open the door to begin to describe the contents of this closet of shame, suddenly there's language for a whole part of experience that otherwise is just bottled up. It's primitive, it's raw, it, you're, you're dealing with that, the, the raw stuff of human beings and, and men and our sense of inadequacy. And the moment you begin to talk about it as shame, you introduce the possibility that it can be described. That it can be put into words. It's simply not that leaden sense of deep, profound, everlasting, eternal unworthiness. But that shame may be, and maybe it's not so shameful after all. Or maybe… 

00:59:20
JETTE SIMON Right. 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON Shame is a great disconnector from the human community. One senses shame. That's the social function. Once you, um, open up a conversation about it, I think people begin to feel reconnected to other people, even if they're in their experience of shame. And something happens. It's, uh, I-I-I think there is something about some light goes on in the eyes in both the men and the women in our groups. As we, we talk about it. Because it's pretty hopeful. 

00:59:50
JETTE SIMON Right. It seems like for the man that they begin to regain some feeling of power. 

00:59:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:59:55
JETTE SIMON And women that they reclaim some hope. Uh, because you an, it's like you notice the man is sitting up in the chair again from, they get a straight back again and the women get a smile. So, it's… 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON Yes. There we are. Yeah. 

01:00:15
JETTE SIMON It was paralyzing. 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Paralyzing. It's a great, great term to describe shame as paralyzing. 

01:00:20
JETTE SIMON Yeah. 

01:00:25
RICH SIMON A-And once you name it, is the beginning of getting people, i-i-it's that's, that's, I think that's a great way to describe it. It's, um, people move from a sense of, kind of a, there's something emotionally paralyzing about experiencing deep shame, and then as you begin to the words, certain words do have a power. So once you have an ability to put into language that deeply paralyzing state known as shame. Particularly for men, um, there's female shame, as well. Some-Somehow this experience of shame is more fundamental to the development of boys and men than it is for women. You know, th-th-that, when you say, um, you're not really a woman it's not as, doesn't stir up a sense of shame the way if you said it to a man. You know, you're not really a man. Or that's not a very manly way to behave. What a parallel. What a curse, that is. That can really reduce someone into a, to a, to a really, uh, a paralyzed state. We're just, we just have a couple of moments now, uh, Jette Simon. Here at the end, now that you've, you've uh, revealed so much. You've given us such a a revealing road map of, of the way that you approach couples. So, last thing. So if, if you could, um, had some advice for people watching this conversation, about how they can become more effective as couples therapists. How they can ex, uh, expand their, uh, their, uh, ability to work with different kinds of couples and, and help people move along through all the challenges of being a couple in today's world. Is, is there any, any, what, what might you want to, what kind of advice might you want to offer to the people who are couples therapists, listening in on this today. 

01:02:20
JETTE SIMON Well, first of all, I think they should come for couples weekend. Get their own experience. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON Excellent idea. 

01:02:30
JETTE SIMON Honestly, 20 years ago when we did the couples workshop ourselves, that was such an eye-opener for me as a therapist. So, I think we need to do the work ourselves as therapists. So (inaudible ), out of the house, bring them to a couples workshop and begin to feel what it's like being in these practices. And, um, and what has certainly helped me a lot is to really sit, get training, sitting with different couples, notice what happens on the inside of me, what gets triggered for me, how to get a map as a clinician in terms of, uh, moving with a couple so that content doesn't scare you but that you keep moving back into a process. So for me the road map has come, you know primarily from imago, but also, uh, training with Sue Johnson in E.F.T. And, so getting a road map, understand what is it really that's going on. knowing that couples don't solve issues. You help them connect and a lot of what, uh, they consider issues will slowly dissolve. So, you know, know how to bring people back into connection. That's, that's the task. 

01:04:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. And to experience, as you said about couples weekends, that you've, make sure before you're going out into heal the world and work with other couples that you've taken a close look at your own couples relationship and, and, and put yourself up there on the firing line. 

01:04:30
JETTE SIMON Right. 

01:04:30
RICH SIMON Well, we're at the end of our time. Um, I, uh, we'll, we'll, uh, see-seems um, I'm generally saying when I say goodbye to, at the end of one of these interviews, I don't expect to see my interviewee for some time to come. But, um, since you're sitting downstairs in your office, and since you're about 30 seconds or less than where I'm sitting now, we'll have an opportunity to relive this experience very shortly. But I've enjoyed it very much. You're not only a, uh, a, uh, a, uh, a very nteresting wife but a very interesting, uh couples therapist interview subject. Thank you for joining us in this series here today.
