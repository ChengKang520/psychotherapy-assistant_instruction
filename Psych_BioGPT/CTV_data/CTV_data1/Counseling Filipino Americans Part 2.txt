Today, you’re going to witness a video between me and a Filipino American client who I’m conducting a counseling session with. He is going to be talking about a difficulty that he is having at work. And as you listen to him talk about his problems, I’ll pay attention to the various ways that as Filipino or Filipino American culture may influence the ways that he approaches the problems and uh… may be how he copes with some of his emotions. Umm… Think specifically, about gender and gender world norms umm… and how difficult it might be for Filipino American men to express their emotions, I mean for us to just really see the dynamic between me and the Filipino American client and what it would be like for Filipino American client to actually have a Filipino American counselor in a counseling session. So, I hope you enjoy the video. Thank you. 

00:01:20
Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Eric 

00:01:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hi, Eric, so tell me what brings you in to talk with me today? 

00:01:25
ERIC I’ve only talked about some racism that’s been going throughout my career, one of the struggles. I work as an equity stage manager, market is very slow. 

00:01:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:01:40
ERIC Uh… For every resume that I send out, I’m competing with 200 other resumes. 

00:01:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:01:45
ERIC At least that’s what I was told and it’s once getting through pass that job some of the racism that I’ve to put up with. 

00:01:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:01:55
ERIC Um… I think one of the significant episodes in recent years, I was doing in the national tour. 

00:02:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:00
ERIC And I’d gotten a job through a friend, who I… at that time I felt… I trusted. 

00:02:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:10
ERIC And it sort of like to slow this integration of a friendship that I thought, I trusted and I think one of the catalyst for it uh… if you were suppose to go on the road I realize that I was pushing 40, whereas everybody, but I was working with the average ages about 25. 

00:02:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:30
ERIC And there’s a friend of mine, who is in his mid 20s introduced me as hi, this is Eric and I like to call him rice paddy. 

00:02:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:40
ERIC And immediately certain electricity went through my body that like no, he didn’t just say that being the only non-Caucasian on the bus. 

00:02:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:02:50
ERIC It was like a definite red flag. 

00:02:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:55
ERIC That’s like okay it’s just the sign of things yet to come and it was for the most part when I realized that I’m working with people who are younger. Uh… you know they’re different maturity level. 

00:03:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:10
ERIC The constant barrage of (non-English narration), Spanish guy he is the trainees guy. 

00:03:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… hmm… 

00:03:20
ERIC Over and over again and just, how do I had to for like eight months. 

00:03:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:03:25
ERIC Ah… had to put up those chokes to the point where I… I… I couldn’t handle it. Every time a remark was made, I completely ignore it to the what I’m thinking I’m shutting down. 

00:03:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:35
ERIC Or being passive aggressive and just that you know how do you cope with that when you’re being forced to be put in a feeling of being in the minority ones… 

00:03:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:03:50
ERIC Really, it’s not something you’re accustomed to. 

00:03:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:03:50
ERIC Ah… Also the fact that it was based on a friendship, it’s like thinking okay, well do I nail this guy up the wall and drill another asshole on him for making these comments or do I let it go. 

00:04:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:05
ERIC Or do I do passive aggressive little letters to the producer saying, by the way, this is what really happened and maybe he should have thought a little bit more about what the circumstances are I think that going on the country… 

00:04:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:04:20
ERIC Never realizing that just to side of me can make a lot of negative comments… 

00:04:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:04:30
ERIC That I wasn’t expecting from total strangers. 

00:04:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:30
ERIC And being frank well, so I think well wait, wait a second. I was doing my job and producer just made a comment that I did something wrong. 

00:04:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:04:45
ERIC Ah And the fact that my friend, basically apologized for it without really knowing the circumstances. It’s like how Eric is being negative again. Well, I’ve an aggressive personality and I know what I’m doing and something that somebody said very intelligently among the local crews, usually the local crews at sometimes kinda thinks about me is that don’t think ahead of these guys. 

00:05:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:10
ERIC And… I don’t know whether it was just a perception that I was working as a wardrobe supervisor, which is traditionally either a women’s job. 

00:05:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:20
ERIC Or a man who’s very feminant(ph) and I don’t come across in a feminant(ph) at least I don’t think I come across as an feminant(ph) man. And thinking about I’ve been with the show for, I don’t know six months, maybe you should be following my instructions and sort of surveying what you think needs to happen and taking it upon yourself because this is my show, you’ve only seen it for five minutes. 

00:05:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:05:50
ERIC And people… 

00:05:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, let’s stop right there. It sounds like you’re… you’re sharing a lot of different things. 

00:05:55
ERIC Yeah. 

00:05:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL That, that sounds like maybe you don’t have an opportunity to talk about… 

00:06:00
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL …as much. Ah… You know you’re talking about some of the experiences of… of racism on that you experienced you know on one job, and then it sounds like umm… there are some other issues involving people you know evaluating your competence of some sort. 

00:06:15
ERIC Hmm… 

00:06:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Um… and you know let’s… before we go into talking about all these things in detail, umm… I just want to just ask really quick checking… 

00:06:25
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL You know what’s it like to… to… to talk about these things. How does that feel for you right now? 

00:06:30
ERIC It doesn’t bother me at all. 

00:06:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:06:35
ERIC I think that it… open honesty is good. 

00:06:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:06:35
ERIC I like think that I’m the person who is reasonably articulate and honest. 

00:06:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:40
ERIC It helps, I’ve gone through acting classes. 

00:06:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:45
ERIC Where you’ve gone through exercises where out… out of opening up your emotions. I think that… a certain level of freedom is availed to me because of certain trainings that I’ve had. 

00:06:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:06:55
ERIC And to not feel that I’m judging myself, but to try and fairly evaluate what’s going on. I think that sometimes when you’re going through personal experiences… 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:10
ERIC That are negative, the first thing is to be hurt; the second point is to figure out why do I feel really hurt by this. 

00:07:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:20
ERIC And finding out, is it me or is it them? 

00:07:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:07:20
ERIC And… 

00:07:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL And you know when I’m hearing, you know you say, you’re saying that you know it’s okay to talk about these things that it doesn’t bother you. But at the same time, you’re using words like I’m feeling hurt and… 

00:07:30
ERIC Yeah. 

00:07:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL You’re talking about this experience of being called a rice paddy, and… 

00:07:35
ERIC Hmm… 

00:07:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL And perhaps there are feeling… 

00:07:35
ERIC Right. 

00:07:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Umm… That maybe, it might be difficult to connect with. 

00:07:40
ERIC Absolutely. 

00:07:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Can you tell me about what makes it difficult to connect to that really because I know… I know for me if I were to be call those things, I would be really hurt and really upset. So, tell me a little bit about that. 

00:07:45
ERIC I think that uh… being and… Well, to be blunt, being an Asian and predominantly Caucasian industry… 

00:07:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:55
ERIC You expect some of those inappropriate comments. 

00:08:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:00
ERIC Reactions, you… you can’t fight every time you hear something inappropriate. 

00:08:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:05
ERIC And I’ve come to realize that a lot of those are innocent little comments by people he didn’t know any better. 

00:08:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:10
ERIC And basically that is the way that they can help to relate to me whether it’s appropriate or not. 

00:08:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:20
ERIC You kinda wanna cut some people some slack at the beginning, but if it becomes constant, and then you’re thinking okay, what… what are my rights at this point? 

00:08:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:30
ERIC And to try and keep yourself from being overly aggressive and defensive, I think that that’s something that I struggle a lot. 

00:08:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:40
ERIC In circumstance where it’s like the king to be… I need to say to rise above it. 

00:08:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:45
ERIC Because you’re only human and at certain point… 

00:08:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:08:50
ERIC You don’t want to rise above it, you want to smack someone in the ass, or I mean some in the face or anyway you just wanna at least say, okay stop it. 

00:08:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:08:55
ERIC Ah… and defend yourself. 

00:09:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:00
ERIC I thought… 

00:09:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Let’s… let’s stop there and let’s talk about just this idea of umm… accepting that it’s okay for these people to make these comments to begin within that it’s something that you’d just expect umm… in the industry that you’re in. What’s it like to be to even just say that to… to say that it’s okay or expect that, that this would be a regular thing. How is that effect to you? 

00:09:20
ERIC Ah… I think it’s being realistic… 

00:09:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:25
 …with our life… umm… I think too many people have too much expectation about how things are suppose to work. 

00:09:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:35
ERIC I tried to… I guess at a certain point when you this enough time there is a certain defense mechanism in order to cope. 

00:09:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:40
ERIC And I think the maturity of being in this industry is fact that you know it’s gonna happen. 

00:09:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:09:50
ERIC Umm… it’s not a great feeling because then, eventually redflags are just popping up. 

00:09:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:55
ERIC And you’re also struggling between your own personal integrity and your professional reputation. 

00:10:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:00
ERIC It’s like thinking what you don’t want to be the angry Asian. 

00:10:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:05
ERIC And that’s always a pigeonhole that you don’t want or even just an… an angry person of color or one of them is angry. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. Right. 

00:10:20
ERIC And I think that that’s mostly important to talk about it. 

00:10:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:25
ERIC Uh… Luckily, I do have a support… thinking that I can bitch to. 

00:10:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:25
ERIC But at times when you know, you made a bad day thinking about partner. And sometimes, you can rely two things, and then sometimes you realize oh, wait a second this is really I didn’t talk this to… to have about this… 

00:10:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:40
ERIC Sometimes you need someone to be on your side, at the time that this (inaudible ) happening, you know you get on the phone, you talk to your mom, you talk to your boyfriends and think oh my god, what should I do this? 

00:10:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:55
ERIC I remember at one point being advised well to write down what they’re saying. 

00:11:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:00
ERIC That way, if something ever happens… 

00:11:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:11:00
ERIC You’ve got a paper trial. And I couldn’t do it. It’s like… yeah, but then I would be writing about a friend. 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… That’s as if there’s a conflict with that because these things are not only are happening and not only are they saw as statement (inaudible ), but… but they’re coming from a friend as well. 

00:11:20
ERIC Yeah. And there’s also a denial about what’s going on. I think there’s a… a fear of confrontation. 

00:11:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:25
ERIC Uh… And I think for most part maybe I should have been more aggressive uh… maybe I shouldn’t have been so passive aggressive… 

00:11:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:35
ERIC Maybe, I shouldn’t have left it off, I mean I was fairly honest with the person about thinking, okay well, that’s not great. 

00:11:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:11:40
ERIC And then you realize that you’re dealing with somebody who doesn’t exactly have a maturity level that you feel can comprehend at what you’re trying to say. Its some people, it’s like… or you can’t possibly be serious. I remember, at one point uh… we traveled in (inaudible ) bus and I put on… on the boat in board uh… the definition for racial harassment. 

00:12:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:05
ERIC They couldn’t believe I did that. And I thinking well, several idiot(ph) in that list they got aggressive towards me… 

00:12:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:15
ERIC …about that. And it… it’s… it’s kind of like you wanna feel like you’re being ganged up. 

00:12:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:20
ERIC There’s some level of trust there that you think, do they know what’s going on, are they capable of like acknowledging you know that what they’re saying is inappropriate or it is just the fact that they have never confronted with a person of color. 

00:12:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:12:40
ERIC Or they feel that well dirty dominant uh… some… a culture, and they’re entitled and they can well no and then titled to say that to me, regardless of what your perception maybe. 

00:12:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:12:55
ERIC I think one-on-one, they’re great. I can rely to them, but somehow when you’re like together and there’s a group of um… and there’s like an agreement oh, well we can get away with saying this… 

00:13:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:10
ERIC …to you, and then it becomes your defects that comes up. 

00:13:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, I mean one thing that I wanted just uh… just checking with you is you know it sounds like you had a lot of these experiences with all kinds of people umm… who… who may have said these hurtful often racially based comments, umm… mostly motivated comments. Umm… And… and I want to validate that I think that umm… it must be really difficult to have to… to go through those types of experiences, especially it sounded like it happen like on an everyday basis. Umm… I think what might be helpful here in this counseling session is for us to not necessarily talk about how awful they’re… 

00:13:45
ERIC Umm… 

00:13:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL And they probably are awful, but maybe to… to maybe focus on how you’re dealing with everything, you know the coping mechanisms umm… that you’ve learned umm… in order to manage some of these situations. 

00:14:00
ERIC Umm… 

00:14:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL And it sounds like you’ve tried every coping mechanism possible from… 

00:14:00
ERIC Uh… 

00:14:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Not doing anything at all to posting this racial harassment signs and you being passive aggressive and other ways. Umm… You know what’s it like to even have to… to deal with, with all these things? 

00:14:15
ERIC It’s… it’s very difficult to… now you can spend the entire time being on with friends because you’re there though higher to do… perform a job. 

00:14:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:25
ERIC Uh… to the best of your ability, I… I think that I do a good job and that’s exactly that I’m expected and you also to relate to the person you’re working with in a positive manner. 

00:14:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:40
ERIC It’s a little hard to gage another person, if you’re just working you don’t know whether or not they’re holding things back. 

00:14:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:50
ERIC Nice to you, yet at the same time they’re talking behind you that you don’t know. But at the same time, I also don’t want to spend the time being paranoid(ph) thinking what are they talking about me or sometimes you may hear something and then again redflags up, am I in trouble or something about to happen and… 

00:15:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:15:10
ERIC Do you… Do I need to preempt something or do I need to call out something before it escalates. I think sometimes, a lot of times, I don't want to confront or be confrontive… 

00:15:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:20
ERIC But at the same time, once provoke I have no problem speaking my mind… 

00:15:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:30
ERIC And then that becomes into struggle in speaking your mind, and then thinking okay, this your job on the line… 

00:15:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:15:40
ERIC How do you defend yourself and not lose your job. 

00:15:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:45
ERIC Because a lot of times in a world like this, there is… they’re not hearing you, they’re seeing an Asian speaking… 

00:15:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:15:50
ERIC Regardless of what you do. A lot of times, I feel that all they see is that how look? 

00:16:00
DR KEVIN NADAL And how does that feel for you? 

00:16:00
ERIC Ah… Sad for them more. 

00:16:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:16:05
ERIC It was like thinking, is your existence so limited? 

00:16:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:10
ERIC But that's how you view me. It’s not, I mean I’m… I am who I am. 

00:16:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Alright. Well, let’s stop right there, you know one thing that I’m noticing in… in our conversation so far is that it seems um… to be difficult for you to identify the emotion that you’re experiencing, you know its a lot of um… intellectualizing but this is how… how they are in feeling sad for them and how, and again I validate that that sounds like an awful experience and… and… you know its… I… I… I can only imagine what… what the experience is like. 

00:16:40
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:40
DR KEVIN NADAL Umm… But, you know let's talk about what… what makes it so difficult to identify the emotion, umm… in being able to… to connect with I… I feel sad… 

00:16:50
 Uh…Huh… 

00:16:50
DR KEVIN NADAL I feel angry, I feel hurt… 

00:16:50
ERIC Yeah. 

00:16:50
DR KEVIN NADAL I feel umm… like sad. 

00:16:55
ERIC Like it's a big waste of my time to feel uh… When you are doing a job and I’m very focused on my work. 

00:17:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:00
ERIC You wanna concentrate on the work. 

00:17:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay, but we’re not in work right now, we’re in the session… 

00:17:05
ERIC Yeah. 

00:17:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Its focusing on you. So what… um… but makes it difficult to connect to emotions. 

00:17:10
ERIC I think trying to relate to what's going on 

00:17:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:15
ERIC I think a lot of times, there is that focus I’ve… I got to get this thing done. Uh… And I need for you to get this done. 

00:17:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:25
ERIC And being in a position of authority… 

00:17:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:30
ERIC You need, I mean when I work, I want to work with people who are efficient. And I like the think that I’m doing my best to do the job as best as I can and treat people as fairly and not have to coddle(ph) to peoples egos, especially in performing arts you do. 

00:17:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:45
ERIC Have to play the game up, how do you deal with a person’s ego… 

00:17:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:50
ERIC And I’m not necessarily the best person to stroke a diva. 

00:17:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:55
ERIC Ah… Certainly do work with them and for most part they’re really nice people. It’s a joy to work in the theatrical industry, it is one of the most satisfying thing. You cannot let these little incidents marginalize your, even to define you as a professional. 

00:18:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… So what do you do with those things and how does that affect you when you… when you don't umm… think about these things, will you try to pretend that they don't affect you? 

00:18:20
ERIC Um… Its hard enough to… not pretend. 

00:18:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Uh…Huh… 

00:18:25
ERIC But I think I try to bring as much honesty into the circumstances. 

00:18:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:30
ERIC A lot of people… and this is sometimes a certain powerplay that you have. 

00:18:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:35
ERIC If they do something and they think they are getting away with it, it’s best to just column on it. 

00:18:40
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:40
ERIC And say, why that this happened? Umm… Sometimes, I think when I was younger, better ways to deal with it. 

00:18:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:50
ERIC Uh… And I think when I was younger going okay, Well, I’m just gonna to pretend if that just didn't happen. And in that respect, it's like you know that was the worst thing I could have done. 

00:19:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:19:00
ERIC And I think, ah… when it happens again, you hope you can handle it better. And you have to learn to trust the people around you. 

00:19:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:10
ERIC Sometimes there are differences, cultural differences, particularly age differences. I tend to notice that it’s… I’m at that point my life and it’s like people below the age of 30 are very annoying… 

00:19:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:30
ERIC Because they are like… they think they know everything. 

00:19:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:30
ERIC And I think that's the right respect about how brilliant was I when I was 25… 

00:19:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:35
ERIC Pretty brilliant. And in that respect, now is a dumb fuck… 

00:19:40
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmmm…Hmm… 

00:19:40
ERIC So, there is… you know you relate what there’s going on. They may not know it, what they are going on, but you tend to cut him some slack. 

00:19:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:19:50
ERIC Because you don't try to judge them, you know that that’s where they are and that's how they think, and you know you are not their mother, you are not their father, you are however, opposition of authority over them. 

00:20:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. Alright, let’s stop right there. Umm… One thing, you know that I have… I have… I’ve been thinking about is your speaking is umm… that it always… and I’m asking you to express your emotions, it really seems to go back to the other person. 

00:20:15
ERIC Yeah. 

00:20:15
DR KEVIN NADAL And… and so, let's not talk about work right now. Let's not talk about the experiences or races and that you have um… had at work. But let's focus on umm… on emotion. 

00:20:25
ERIC Okay. 

00:20:25
DR KEVIN NADAL What… what messages have you learned about a feeling emotion, expressing emotion, coping with these negative emotions, when you experience them? 

00:20:35
ERIC I think it’s very liberating to express your emotions. There are times when you go that point where you don't want a pass. 

00:20:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:45
ERIC And that it becomes very difficult. And I think that there’s certain fear. 

00:20:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:55
ERIC About going, I mean sometimes, yeah I think my biggest fantasy, uh… glass room with tiffany lamps and crystals all around you and a bat. 

00:21:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:10
ERIC And thinking, god that would be so therapeutical to just let lose. And that you know trying to figure, okay well, that’s just silly. And at the same time that's also would be a lot of fun. 

00:21:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:25
ERIC So, struggling with that emotion of just you know, just wanting to, I can't smack somebody. 

00:21:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:21:30
ERIC And thinking well, that’s not you know, emotion versus reason, its like you know… 

00:21:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Right, but it does speak to the amount of, maybe anger or frustration… 

00:21:35
ERIC Oh, yeah. 

00:21:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Or you know hurt or whatever the feeling might be that you have, that you hold up and, and that maybe you want to be able to let it out by smashing all of these tiffany lamps in this glass house and that sort of the thing. 

00:21:50
ERIC Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR KEVIN NADAL But it… it seems like you are not letting that go, you are not… you are not expressing that emotions at some point. 

00:21:55
ERIC Huh… No, I think sometimes it comes on the wrong way at home. 

00:21:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:22:00
ERIC I think there are times when you know, I love my partner, but at times it does me crazy. 

00:22:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:05
ERIC And that was a fairly young relationship, we’ve been together for three and a half years about three and a half (inaudible ) listens thing, am I picking on him, am I being too judgmental? 

00:22:11
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:15
ERIC I mean… 

00:22:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. How does that feel, the fact that maybe these emotions are then coming umm… out in your relationship with somebody that you love and… and maybe you are displacing some of those emotions that come from somewhere else on to him. 

00:22:25
ERIC I think that’s being in our relationship you’ll suddenly realize you are responsible for another person and that's a little frightening. 

00:22:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:35
ERIC It's like thinking yeah, but and I’ve also committed myself to forever with this person. And you’re… you kinda frightened to go into that, how do I protect him emotionally? 

00:22:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:45
ERIC And that's really a struggle. It’s like thinking oh, that I crossed the line that if I go somewhere that hurt his feelings, its like it hurts me. 

00:22:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:55
ERIC I don't like to bring that pain to them. 

00:22:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:55
ERIC I think that he handles it well, but you know… you know you got a question. 

00:23:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:23:00
ERIC Is he handling it well or is he repressing it because you are capable of saying it, but he’s not. 

00:23:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:05
ERIC And I think that that's to his credit. I’m not sure that, that he is able to handle it, I keep thinking good god, most people would have and I think it’s one of my biggest fear, okay well, we got to get rid of this guy. 

00:23:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:20
ERIC And I think that that's a level of our commitment to each other, that you don’t have any job. 

00:23:25
DR KEVIN NADAL So, I… I uh… you know, I definitely think that this is something that we can explore, we can talk about some other ways that maybe you umm… you experience these emotions and may be it comes out in your relationship with your partner and maybe, it comes out with another relationships… 

00:23:40
ERIC Hmm…Hmm…/ 

00:23:40
DR KEVIN NADAL You have with your family. Umm… But you know, I think maybe, if this is something that we need to… to talk about is uh… just how are you coping with these emotions, and how might it… 

00:23:50
ERIC Hmm… 

00:23:50
DR KEVIN NADAL And how might it be very easy to… to move to this intellectualizing or… or just uh… you know rationalizing that these people are ignorance or that they are young… 

00:24:00
ERIC Hmm… 

00:24:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Or whatever it might be because it is not focusing on what… 

00:24:00
ERIC Yeah. 

00:24:00
DR KEVIN NADAL What you are going through? And it gets me to think about, you know the fact that you are a Filipino American. 

00:24:05
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Umm… And some of the messages that Filipinos often learn about a most and especially, for men; that men aren’t supposed to feel sad. 

00:24:15
ERIC Yeah. 

00:24:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Men aren’t supposed to cry and men aren’t supposed to umm… you know feel a… well, you could feel angry maybe, but that you are not supposed to seem weak… 

00:24:30
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:30
DR KEVIN NADAL In anyway. 

00:24:30
ERIC Yeah. 

00:24:30
DR KEVIN NADAL And as I’m talking to you, one thing that I… I’ve been experiencing is just umm… this idea that you know its… it must be really hard to feel those things, and maybe, so you had been building this wall tonight… 

00:24:40
ERIC Yeah. 

00:24:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Not experi… or not to… to be perceived that way. 

00:24:45
ERIC Yeah. I’m I… I think for most part you know, it is a lot about family, I think. Lately, when I visit my family, it is that falling into your family, yeah… intellectualizing it. You fall back into your… into your family well if being the youngest. 

00:25:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:00
ERIC And being uh… the person gets picked odd… 

00:25:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:10
ERIC I think a lot of it comes from being the youngest. 

00:25:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:10
ERIC And being expected to, but… just but you know, buck it up. 

00:25:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:15
ERIC Buck up and just I mean, let's face it. Umm… In the period when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s there was no huggy feeling… 

00:25:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:30
ERIC I mean my mother was very nurturing and comforting; father a little distant maybe, uh… I know that my parents love me. Uh… I think one of the things that I always have to feel about is being the victim. 

00:25:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:45
ERIC Because of a lot of times being the youngest, I get victimized by my big brothers. 

00:25:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:50
ERIC The person tease, the person talk that because they can. 

00:25:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:55
ERIC Because I’m younger and they are older and they have a certain power. And I think for the most part, its something that I’ve always struggled with. 

00:26:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:05
ERIC You know I think I remember being 12-years old and not, let’s say I don't wanna say who you are anymore because, basically I don't like them. 

00:26:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:15
ERIC There are not exactly the nicest people in the world… world and who you are supposed to be a sign of respect and I came to realize, I really don't respect my brothers and I think a lot of that held on even to this present day that I don't particularly like my siblings I… I’ve recently close to my sister, but even then, its like… like at times, that she just drives me nuts. And because I felt the need to get away from them. 

00:26:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:50
ERIC That my mother was now a widow, my father passed away about one and year ago, a lot of these old concept of being the youngest has come back I remember uh… being at the funeral and being on my father’s you know about the casket(ph) and I almost broke into tears and my mother immediately say [non-English narration] and it’s like I haven't heard that, since I was little. 

00:27:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Alright. 

00:27:20
ERIC And its like… and I didn’t. I held that in. I and I’m intelligent I’ve to know not to do it. 

00:27:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:30
ERIC But that feeling of, no don't do it. 

00:27:35
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:35
ERIC But I know that my mother didn't mean it because I know that my mother when she said it, her voice cracked. 

00:27:40
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:40
ERIC Then she knew that it was hurting me. 

00:27:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:45
ERIC But I did exactly what my mother said, but I was comforted because even though it’s something that I haven't heard. She acknowledges, I’m adult. 

00:27:50
DR KEVIN NADAL HHmm…Hmm… 

00:27:55
ERIC And she knew exactly what I was feeling, whether its not… its a social thing or in the foyer(ph) of a church and there is family all around us and its not you know, socially acceptable to break down and cry and for the family. You know, I mean there is… 

00:28:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:28:10
ERIC It… Its really is kinda strange to be at a funeral. 

00:28:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:28:15
ERIC Because in… in many ways you are on display for the rest of your family. 

00:28:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. Okay, let’s you know, we’re running out of time… 

00:28:25
ERIC Yeah. 

00:28:25
DR KEVIN NADAL In our session and… Umm… And one thing that I just wanna acknowledge is that it sounds like there’s a lot that we… we could talk about… 

00:28:30
ERIC Hmm… 

00:28:30
DR KEVIN NADAL You know and its sounds like umm… you know maybe you don’t get a chance to talk about all these things. 

00:28:35
ERIC Yeah. 

00:28:35
DR KEVIN NADAL And I could kinda see, you know you’re really trying to think about all these different huh… pieces to your past. 

00:28:40
ERIC Yeah. 

00:28:40
DR KEVIN NADAL And maybe that’s something that we can… we can examine,… 

00:28:45
ERIC Hmm… 

00:28:45
DR KEVIN NADAL As we continue some of our… our counseling sessions. We are not going to solve everything… 

00:28:50
 Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:50
DR KEVIN NADAL …at this one 30-minute session. Umm… But maybe, in the future we could look at, you know your… your family history, what are some of the messages you learned from… from your family, umm… what are the some other messages you learned being the youngest and having… 

00:29:00
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:00
DR KEVIN NADAL …these (inaudible ) these older brothers who… who you didn't necessarily respect, I mean who pick… picked on you… 

00:29:05
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Umm… What’s it like being in… in this Filipino culture that may have taught you on certain things about… about sharing your emotions. 

00:29:15
ERIC Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Umm… But I think that, you know we need to uh… uh… recognize that this isn’t gonna happen… 

00:29:20
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:20
DR KEVIN NADAL In one session. I mean what I hope is that we can continue… 

00:29:25
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Talking about these things umm… and that we could explore all these issues. Umm… But I what I wanna challenge you to do you know umm… from today is… is that just think about, you know your emotions and how do you react when something happens and what do you do with it? Do you immediately go to intellectualizing or rationalizing or putting blame on the other person umm… and… and… maybe you could just sit with something. 

00:29:50
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:50
DR KEVIN NADAL You know like I oh, I feel sad or… or that was really frustrating… 

00:29:50
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:50
DR KEVIN NADAL That makes me feel angry and that's just maybe one step… 

00:29:55
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:55
DR KEVIN NADAL That we could do or we can continue umm… this in our… 

00:29:55
ERIC Yeah. 

00:29:55
DR KEVIN NADAL The rest of our sessions. 

00:30:00
ERIC Okay. 

00:30:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL How does that sound? 

00:30:00
ERIC Perfect, yeah. 

00:30:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. Great. Thank you. 

00:30:00
ERIC Thanks. 

00:30:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Take care. 

00:30:05
De-Briefing of Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Eric 

00:30:05
DR KEVIN NADAL So Eric, again thank you so much for participating in this video. Can you tell me a little bit about umm… what you may have liked about our counseling session as well as maybe, something, some areas for improvements and any other comments that you may have? 

00:30:20
ERIC Uh… It's little hard to say something. Uh… Uh… I think one of the nice thing about this is that it was very open. Uh… And I think one of the problems sometimes with counseling is that you get on and on and on and on to the path where you’re not really saying anything significant. And sometimes… 

00:30:40
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:40
ERIC The fact that you know stopping me, challenge… 

00:30:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:45
ERIC You know, try to get me off track or at least change my way of thinking or at least talk about something else, see where it leads to. It helps to connect with other things that may be going on, I think one of the problems sometimes with counseling sometimes I don’t know what it mean sometimes… 

00:31:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:00
ERIC Is I won’t believe intellectualize things, you try to be as preserved and… and there’s a big… big difference between intellectualizing and being honest… 

00:31:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:15
ERIC Its like difference between counseling and polite society, you… you’re here for a reason and there’s no reason to hold back and I think one of the most difficult things is when come my way thinking that you hold back… 

00:31:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:30
ERIC And sometimes, when… and… and… after leaving you’re thinking, god why should I have done that, why did… you judge, you could (inaudible ) afterwards. So, at least you… at least I know that I can though there probably be a lot of (inaudible ) afterwards to you and more intellectually. It’s like thinking alright, emotionally, you just wanna let it go umm… and I have this philosophy, it… it was what it was… 

00:31:55
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:55
ERIC And just trying to always control what's going on. I think it’s nice to be a little bit more vulnerable I think… 

00:32:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. It’s where you are able to see that, it was difficult for you get vulnerable. 

00:32:10
ERIC Oh, yeah. 

00:32:10
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:32:10
ERIC Yeah. And I think… I think that even though I didn't go throughout being completely vulnerable, I at least got off my pedestal… 

00:32:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:25
ERIC And say, Oh my god, these people are so horrible (inaudible ) that they don't know how brilliant I am. And that's ego… 

00:32:30
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:30
ERIC And… and well, I know I said, ego I had… I don't… I don’t remember it, it's been a while. Uh… But I think a certain level of honesty, I suppose to foreshow it helps I think that… 

00:32:45
DR KEVIN NADAL I see, you’ve thought that I was able to get you to become a little bit more honest. 

00:32:50
ERIC More and more honest. Yeah… 

00:32:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Rather than financial… 

00:32:50
ERIC I mean I did think of I was about to talk about my mom… 

00:32:50
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:32:55
ERIC Or even mention my dad, umm… I thought that, I mean prior to showing up his thinking, okay well, if I talk about my mom and dad, I’m not going to the completely different thing about racism… 

00:33:05
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:05
ERIC And I’m thinking well, now it’s… it’s fairly connected, uh… that’s fairly centralized feelings. And in fact, that you know… 

00:33:15
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:33:15
ERIC You know relating, smacking co-workers with smacking the hell out your brothers… 

00:33:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:25
ERIC Its kinda liberating to actually, openly admit that. I know I think of that. 

00:33:25
DR KEVIN NADAL Right. So you are able to relate that to different situations and maybe, that there is a core feeling behind uh… 

00:33:30
ERIC Yeah, yeah. And… and I think it’s also nice to finally verbalize feelings of not wanting to be victimize the way I was victimized by being the youngest. 

00:33:45
DR KEVIN NADAL Sure. Sure. Yeah. And so, I mean… I again I thank you for… for sharing umm… your experience with… with me and… and with this training video. Umm… And you know I gotten that, I just think it… it was uh… for me my experience was that it was umm… it was very telling that it was difficult for you to share your emotions and they… 

00:34:00
ERIC Hmm… 

00:34:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Called me to think about how just Filipino men and so, in general have been socialized to not talk about emotions… 

00:34:05
ERIC Yeah. 

00:34:05
DR KEVIN NADAL To rationalize, to intellectualize. Umm… And so, I’m glad that you were able umm… to be open to when I… 

00:34:10
ERIC Yeah. 

00:34:10
DR KEVIN NADAL …I challenged you to do that. 

00:34:10
ERIC Yeah. 

00:34:10
DR KEVIN NADAL So again, so thank you so much for being a part of the video. 

00:34:10
ERIC Well, thank you. 

00:34:20
DR KEVIN NADAL Okay, thanks.
