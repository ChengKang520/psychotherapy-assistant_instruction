 It is with great honor and pleasure that I introduce to you Dr. Gail Wyatt. Even though I'm gonna claim her as being middle age her professional productivity is, is certainly that of a senior pioneer. She was the first African-American woman to be licensed as a Psychologist in the State of California. Can you believe that? Wow! (applause)

 (Sighs) She's a sex educator and has developed curricula for school age children around human sexuality. She's a diplomate of the American Board of Sexology and a fellow of the American Psychological Association in the American Academy of Clinical Sexologists. Dr. Wyatt has been a National Institute of Mental Health Research Scientist Career Development awardee for the past 17 years and is currently a research scientist. She is the first African-American woman to be so honored. Her research examines the consensual and abusive sexual relationships of African-American and White women and the effects of these experiences on their psychological well-being and risks for sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Aids. Recently, she has been principal investigator of several grants including aids related sexual decision-making areas, sexuality and intimacy and breast cancer survivors, risk taking and adjustment in African-American, Latino, White, Asian and native American HIV Positive women and she also does work in the area to increase me, medical adherence and de, and decrease sexual and drug related risk taking among HI, HIV infected men and women. She has published numerous, numerous journal articles and book chapters and has co-edited several books and authored several books. We're lucky that she has her new book Stolen Women, available and will be uh, available to buy, to purchase here today. So, look for Dr. Wyatt's table Stolen Wo, Women is about African-Americans, Af, African-Americans sexua, wa, African-American women sexuality. Dr. Wyatt was a Silver Achievement Honoree from the Greater Los Angeles YWCA for her research. She was the first African-American woman honored for Distinguished Contributions to Research on Public Policy by the American Psychological Association. She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters Degree from the California School of Professional Psychology. She's been honored for Distinguished Research by the Society for the Study of Ethnic, Ethnicity and Culture of APA and she is a 1995 Carolyn Sherif Awardee for The Psychology of Women (Division 35) of the American Psychological Association. The Association of Black Psychologist gave her an award for Scholarship. This UCLA Black Staff and Faculty and Women of Color Psychologist gave her an award for her book, her recent book Stolen Women. Dr. Wyatt is an a Associate Professor of the UCLA Aids Institute and Coordinates a core of behavioral scientist who consult with other researches to recruit under-served populations and conduct research that effectively incorporates social, cultural factors in HIV Aids research. Gail is uh, is a dynamic presenter. You have a real treat comin' in, comin' up. We were on a, I, one of the, times that's I remember spending with her was on a symposium at APA about 10 or 12 years ago and I remember there are two things that impressed me the most. One is that there were about 80 people in the room at that time, that was a tremendous number of people for a symposium of color at APA. Look at us now. (laughs) Uh, and (sigh) it was one of those very powerful special uh, symposia, experiences that we rarely have at APA and some of Gail's moving stories about her experiences with racism and sexism uh, were what God is there. Uhm, a lot like uh, our senior women of color presentations and comments did yesterday. Gail has been happily married for 33 years to Dr. Lewis Wyatt, an Obstetrician/Gynecologist in private practice. They have two children, both of whom are physicians. Lance is a resident in General Surgery and Lacey completed her training in Family Medicine as, and is working on her MPH in Maternal and Child Health. Lacey's husband Gavin is a resident and Ob-Gyn and they have made Dr. Wyatt a grandmother with the arrival of Camille Elizabeth. The family enjoys a commitment to health and to each other. Please help me welcome, Dr. Gail Wyatt. (applause)

GAIL WYATT  Thank you. Wow! What a pleasure to be here. What a wonderful room with so much energy and so much ethnicity uh, such a mixture of people. I, I can't tell you how thrilled I was when Mabel(ph) call me a while ago and asked me if I would do this and I didn't know anything about it but uhm, Mabel(ph) calls and you say yes, right? (laughs) You, you don't think about it. You know people you don't say no to. Uh, but I, I'm so thrilled to see the way that this conference has come together, it's a real team effort, isn't it? The way that all the divisions came on board. I think we have to recognize the power and the, the significance of Division 45. Do you know how hard we had to fight to get that Division? Uh, and just to see it thrive the way it has and to pull others divisions in. It's so important and I think what we're doing today is gonna set a template, I don't think APA will ever be the same and I hope none of you will ever be the same. But your gonna take from this, something very special and a, and a recommitment to what multiculturalism is all about but make your own commitment to do what you can on your own level. I wanna thank the conference organizers for putting me behind uh, Tommy Parham just today (laughing) and you know uh, that was so challenging of you. (laughs) Uh, I know you, you knew that I was more senior and you know, so let Tommy just you know rock us and you know, here I come uh, but I wanna thank you for that. It really made me go back to my room (laughs) and ask God to guide me, you know. (applause) You know, there, there's only so many things you can say and uhm, then you have to go back to the Lord and say you know, help me get inside of me and pull from me something very different so that I can give you something very different from what you've already heard because you have heard some of the finest speakers that I have ever known and I hope you appreciate uh, what this two days have been about 'coz the people that you've heard could've been the keynote speaker and I would've been it, right? Each one was a desert and that's such a blessing for us to be together to be able to just do this and keep doing it and I think what happen this morning with that dialogue was so special 'coz this number of people is perfect isn't it? You know, just to be able to have a dialogue not to have to breakout but actually to be able to talk to one another so you don't have to hear it through someone else's you know, interpretation but be able to talk to one another, we need to do this. This is therapeutic, isn't it? It's cleansing for us, those of us who understand this issues, we need to do this more often so I surely hope you let uh, the, uhm, people who organize this conference and they're listed in the front of your program. Stop 'em and thank 'em and hold their hands and hug 'em and say do it again, you know don't let all the paperwork and the, and the financial problems and this and that and all the things that make you understand back and say uh, you know it was good so let's leave it alone. Reinforce this, it needs to happen, you know there are a lot of people here that don't know all the issues that's been said before, there are a lot of people who do but we need to keep talking to one another. I wanna thank Dick Suinn for being the President of APA this year and making this part of his initiative. We needed that kind of on the top reinforcement and, and for him to stand up and say that this was important, helped all of us to know that we should be here, we should take time out of what we're doing. He's always had a vision, he's always been out there and, and I think APA is going to be so much better and so much stronger for the courage that he has. And I don't know whether he's in the room now and it doesn't matter. I mean, he knows how I feel about him and I voted for him and I voted for him and I voted for him, you know. (laughs) And that's what it takes, doesn't it? You just keep voting for him, you know you don't give up. You don't let anybody turn you around and he didn't give up and I knew I couldn't and that's what you have to do. Just 'coz you don't win something or get something the first time, doesn't mean it does, it didn't suppose to be yours and that's what my mother used to tell me. God just put it on another step. I mean you just got over, you just got to step more steps so you can still reach it and that's the way you have to see things that you don't always get. He's a great model for you so you don't see defeat just 'coz you don't get it the first time. There are people in this room who helped me to be who I am and where I am and, and like Tommy this morning and like I'm sure so many of the presenters that I actually slept through yesterday uhm, and not because I'm not respectful but 'coz I was so tired and I wanted to give you everything I have this afternoon but I have some people to thank. Uhm, I wanna thank Darryl because I know he is the current President of 45. I've already thank Mel but I wanna thank Lisa Porche-Burke. (applause) Lisa asked me to do this uhm, Lisa worked with all of us even in spite of all the shush, suffering that she went through. She stood like a woman of grace, encouraged like a mother and a father with, what expected you to do she did it and she held her head up and she's not a bitter woman and I think you know, that again is a role model for us all to remember. That the people who suffered the most sometimes can demonstrate for us that even when someone tries to knock you down you are not out and I wanna thank Lisa for being that kind of person. (applause)

GAIL WYATT  I'm gonna begin now and I want you to listen and I want you to feel the spirits in this room with me. My ancestors, my ancestors standing up here next to me, right now. They always stand with me when I'm getting ready to do something important or when I have done something that they know they don't agree with, alright. (laughs) And there are a lot of people who help me be what I am but, but Henry Thompson is in the house and I couldn't, I couldn't let him be ignored because Henry was my teacher at Fisk University and he was my master's teacher when I got my masters there too and he was the only person when I was in graduate school, getting my bachelor's and masters who, I think understood what I was trying to do. And, I got married very young, probably some of you know my story. I got married at 20 and I don't know anything about sex or, or contraceptives that's why I'm a sex researcher today. I figure if, if I didn't know, a whole lot of people didn't know and I need to help them know. And uhm, had a baby, got pregnant eight months into my marriage and there I was in graduate school and didn't know what in heavens name I was gonna do. And so, all I could figure out to do was just keep going and so I put my little son Lance in a little plastic chair. Some of you don't remember those little plastic chairs that you had, I used to take my son in a little plastic chair and go up to Henry's office and he would work with me on my master's degree and Lance would be yellin' and screamin' and throwin' his toys all across the room and Henry would just be talking about my master's thesis. (laughs) It was just amazing. He just kept me right on my program and I'd be pickin' up stuff and puttin' bottles in the mouth and burpin' and carrin' on and Henry would just go right on and I'd take my notes. I want him to stand, this is a man of courage. (applause) 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:30
GAIL WYATT  If you don't know Henry, you ought to 'coz if ever you get in trouble, if ever you need somebody to keep you right on your program, you go talk to him. He's right in that office in Washington, D.C. at APA and believe me, I thank you Henry for always being there for me. There's another man who's in my life who isn't here. He's speaking in Carson, California. He came down here, carries my bags and irons my clothes for me. He pats me when I'm cryin' and I'm down he's, he's my husband, Lewis, a lot of you know him, he comes almost every APA and he walks around and listens to stuff and he's very central to me. I want you to know, I'm a woman in context. I don't believe that I was born to be married or good to be with a man but I do believe that he is my soul mate and he helped me to be here today in spite of all my exhaustion and I wanna thank Lewis even in his absence for being see here. So, you see him and you probably will and you tell him for me, will you? Thank you for Gail.

GAIL WYATT (Sigh) May 31st of 1998, had events in it that changed my entire life. It challenged my identity, my responsibilities, my sense of family and all of those three ingredients form the text of this presentation today, because social justice is something I've been fighting for since the day I was born. I'm from a family of people who fought for social justice. I am the 4th generation of college educated African-Americans. It's a responsibility to have the privileges that I've had but May 31st did something for me that no other day in my life has ever done, that was the day I became a grandmother. And through all the joy of watching my daughter and her husband gave birth to this absolutely gorgeous pumpkin. (laugh) I suddenly sat down on that couch 'coz you know today you have babies in the rooms and like living rooms, (laughing) you know and your family is there and they were sitting, it's a family thing, it's wonderful. I sat on that couch and I got very quite and I thought my God, I'm never gonna be the same. I have to tell the stories and teach those lessons all over again. You know my children are grown so I thought I'd done my duty and I had and here came Camille Elizabeth and I realized I have to be the one to turn it back around, right? I have to tell her what it means. I have to tell her and teach her the lessons. I have to teach the lessons to every single person who she comes in contact with, you see because her world, her perceptions will be shaped by those people who have something to do with Camille Elizabeth and that in turn will shape how she feels about herself. So, multiculturalism is not something that belongs to just a few people, not you in this room. Multiculturalism is something that belongs to everybody 'coz it's a major dimension in a person's life. Everyone has a culture. We don't talk about European-American culture 'coz we think we know it. We don't know it. We can only learn it through the people that we meet because each person takes that lesson, takes those stories and they breathe life into it all over again. This should be something that's as basic as Math and English. There shouldn't be anybody who gets to any other level in their life without it. It's essential and how we've managed to think it's something that's an option, it's an alternative, it's just beyond me. We're doing something extremely important here. I wanna share with you the importance of it through myself so you can see that I struggle with it too, all of the challenges that it takes, to be truly committed to multiculturalism. I thought I knew who I was until I saw that baby and then I realized, my mother who's still alive and her great grandmother won't live into the 21st century long enough to tell her the stories and teach her the lessons. I'll have to that for her. I'll have to teach her what it means to be an African descended warrior and that's a very serious lesson that I have to teach today. My identity has been shaped and so I challenge you to think about what it is going to take for your identities that have to be shape in the 21st century. Part of that is our reality. No one can tell us what it's like to be who we are. You could be a gay, you could be black, brown doesn't matter what color. You could be who you are as tall, thin, fat, striped or plaid, the issue is no one can tell you what your reality is and you must define it and you must live it. That's the first lesson of identity. We have measures today that we never ever had before. We have initiatives today that we've never had before and those are important but you must write about your reality. And that means that the research you do and the classes you teach and the people you mentor and the supervision that you give, all has to be colored with your reality. Don't let anybody tell you that a researcher is like a black box, that's ridiculous. How could you just objectify what you do? You must define what you do and explain it, so that at least people know where you're coming from. It's extremely important that we write not only for academic journals but for ethnic journals. At UCLA where I have spent the last 25 years of my life, I have been challenged daily by scholars who told me, you shouldn't write for ethnic journals because you're not gonna get credit for it. So I am so delighted that we now have a journal for Division 45 so that we will have state of the art pieces about ethnicity and culture and how to study ethnicity and culture for the first time. It's amazing to me that APA has gone on this long and not had a journal like this but I'm so proud that we do now because that then helps us to legitimize the fact that we wanna write about some of these issues but there are other journals and I just want you to know, they need to be fed by what we think and feel and the work that we do. It's important that we create different paradigms of thinking about people and life and what our reality is. I am convinced from the work that I've done that poverty is a significant predictor of adjustment, health, psychological well-being, you name it. And then if you crunched down people, if you can just get beyond race, and get beyond ethnicity and you look at what predictor is the most powerful one in your work, it's poverty. And when you understand how to study it and you understand how to teach it, then you know that there are layers of life's issues that build on the kinds of economic resources that you had. And education is extremely important but even educated people live impoverish lives. Do you know that? Do you know that you can study the health habits of middle class people and if they grew up in poverty their health habits are what? They're, the one's that they practice when they were poor. You see extremely rich people today, who have health habits of very poor people, they'll wait and let their teeth rot, won't they? Because they're afraid that their teeth will be pulled out like so many people's teeth were pulled out until about the 1950 'coz you know it was cheaper to pull a tooth than to fill a tooth. You have to really get into what it means to be poor 'coz poverty is a state of mind. It's not about the money, it's about how you, you, you've, you drank that message that you don't go to a doctor until you are half dead. And people, look at people who have diseases today, and they think there's a well-dressed and spoke and then this and that yet they don't understand that psychological well-being was something you protected by not admitting that you had a problem, not by talking about it, you didn't, it makes you had a problem. That meant you were healthy and you were strong. People still have these belief systems. People still believe that you don't go to the doctor because if you do that's a sign of weakness. We have a lot of re-educating to do around health and well-being and what it means. People still come up to me in private and say, "I'd like to have your card but I don't want you to bring it out of you purse. I want you to slip it to me in my hand behind my back." And I'd say, why? (laughing) And they say because I don't want anybody to know that I'm coming to you. And I said, okay. And I said, and if we ever meet socially, should I acknowledge you? Oh no. I'll meet you all over again in a social situation. So I go all over the place and meet people I see in therapy every week. Hello there, how are you? (laughing) It's nice to meet you, because they are still afraid of acknowledging the fact that they see a therapist. This is major. This not you know, because we're comfortable with it doesn't mean everybody is. I see people who are infected with HIV, very visible people. I see people who have inappropriate sexual behavior and consulted with the, the, the team that's, that's dealing with Clinton right now. And all that I heard from UCLA was that I was late in getting some of my promotion papers in. They didn't appreciate the fact that these are rare opportunities and people don't understand a lot about what's going on everyday and those who have the opportunity to help need to understand this are not issues that everybody's comfortable with. We need to understand acculturation in understanding identity. Acculturation is not a dichotomous variable, it's not a total score on a test. You can be acculturated and be within your cultural group like many of us are on holidays and then you can be acculturated in a classroom with other people but it is something that ebbs and flows, its very fluid. We know that from my research that acculturation has a specter of seduction about it because there's a lot about being American that's very, very toxic. It's not good for a lot of people and particularly people from very high context cultures who believe in children and family life and trusting one's mate and taking time in social and academic and work relationships. People from certain cultures don't do well when they come to America and they acculturate because what they do is give up the essence of some other things that makes life worthwhile for them and then they take on the American culture and sometimes those cultural values are very, very harmful to them. We're studying how culture has to ebb and flow but we don't know enough about it to be able to tell you that if you study a group like Latinas or Latinos, that we understand what acculturation means to them. That we study American-Indians, that we understand what acculturation means. In my current work with HIV, we have a sample of American-Indian people, women who don't like to admit that they are indeed American-Indian because in every other walk of life, it's better for them not to talk about their own cultural heritage. That's very sad documentation, isn't it? The groups of people have to deny who they are in order to be accepted in our larger society. So, when you talk about psychological well-being and health issues it has a great impact on who they see and who, what they tell about themselves. We have a lot to do, a lot of work to do in helping to understand identity. We need to understand duality when we talk about identity. That is, how much of yourself as an ethnic person do you retain and how much of it do you give away. How much of it are you in touch with when you come to a place like this and how much of it are you in touch with when you go to a party or when you go to church or when you're around you relatives. It's the ability to have duality that actually is very healthy but we don't understand enough about it. People will tell me when they hear me speak, well, you don't sound like an African-American. That's a, well, how does an African-American sound? Well, when we watched television, you know we hear them when talking, you know and I said, well no that's, that's not dialect first of all, you know the people don't even know what dialect is. People don't know what Ebonics is, people don't know what a person with an accent sounds like when they're from Texas. Sharon Jenkins knows 'coz I'm from Texas. Texans can hear Texas in my speech, Southerners can hear Southern dialect in my speech but if you don't know that about me and if you don't ask the right questions you're gonna miss the fact that you can understand me unless when you are grew up from southern parents. That means something very different, doesn't it? Then just know that I'm a person who lives in Los Angeles are big the dichotomy there, big dichotomy. So understand du, duality is key. These are important research questions that some of these young scholars ought to be taking on. Coping, avoidant coping is central to people of color. We have survived by not dealing with more things than we deal with. If you read my book, if you read Stolen Women, I spent months and months researching from slave narratives that you can now buy, the Smithsonian has a wonderful collection of slave narratives in the voice of the people who were slaves. If you listen, if you read, you'll know that avoidant coping was a major strategy that was used to just get along from day to day. Avoidant coping today will kill you. So how do we make the gap between understanding when to use avoidant coping and when you can't use it anymore. Avoidant coping keeps you away from people who discriminate against you. You just don't talk to them. You just don't go in those rooms. You just don't go in those restaurants or hotels or those schools. But if you don't go to the doctor, it can kill you. You see, so there's a lot we have to learn and we don't ask about avoidant coping. What do you avoid? We always ask what you do but what don't you do? Some people live, little teeny-bitty, did you know that? Little bitty teeny-weeny lives. They only talk to people who will talk to them in a friendly way. Anybody gets an attitude, they're gone. Off the list, they only go places where they feel comfortable and so you end up with people who miss a great segment of our society and that we know nothing about and that's what being on the book tour the last year and a half did for me. It exposed me to people I would never have talked to. People who don't ever come to a university setting, people who don't come to clinics or hospitals. They don't come to hear people speak. But they'll come to hear something written that they can understand, it's extremely important to write not only for academic audiences but for the general community. What you know has to be taken to a different level and you really can't get caught up and just may continue or just being professor or making money. You've got to take what you know back. I'm gonna talk about reaching back in a minute. All of this things are part of identity that we still don't understand a lot about. That second issue, responsibility, responsibility to take what you know and to pass it on, it's a big one. But there are many levels of responsibility that I think are challenging for us. The first one is reaching inside. You can't be an agent for social justice until you know who you are all about. And I'm going to talk about something that we don't talk about a lot in mixed groups and that's self hatred. A lot of us don't like who we are and I mean from gay, to heterosexual, to person of color, to women, a lot of us don't like who we are. When I'm comfortable with it, we really haven't come to accept what it means in terms of perhaps limiting the places we can go, we haven't come to grips with what it really means to make it a celebration. Self-hatred is something that you see every single day and you see more and more of it because the people who speak against their own groups are the people who are now becoming more and more visible in our society. I wanna just name one for you, one of my favorites is Larry Elders and he speaks routinely and daily against affirmative action, he speaks against women, he speaks against gays, he speaks about African-Americans most of all and he makes a lot of money doing it. These are the kind of people you're gonna see more and more of. These are the people who are embraced by other people who want those people to tell, take their messages and tell their stories. We have to be very very careful about people we see as having a right to speak but also having a lot of self-hatred. I have called Larry Elders and I'd said I love to be on your program, please invite me. (laughing) No, no, no, I'll never get that opportunity but some of you might, some of you might and for people who have a lot of self hatred, we really do have to talk to them. You can isolate yourself from them. Some of 'em don't really know how much they really do hate who they are. They don't know what that means and they have begun to align themselves with the aggressor whomever that might be and take on those kinds of racist, sexist, homophobic attitudes that really are more they're own agenda than anybody else's. We have some on the supreme court? We have people all around, don't we, who have a tremendous amount of self hatred. This are people who will, will be legislating for us. Who will be making decisions about policy. Who make decisions about affirmative action. Tremendous self hatred. It's something that we need to deal with but we don't study it, responsibility to reach in. Second is to reach out. I've been doing a lot of reaching out lately and I hope you have too. What's going on in Washington, D.C. right now, is a plantation, is plantation mentality. When you see people turn against the tide of how the majority feels and turn around, it's just like up, to me a pack of wolves around one animal. What's happening in Washington today is a plantation because our Congress persons and our senators are acting as if they represent the will of the American people and that happened already. We have been there and done that and there were people who stood 250 years ago by and said that's not happening in my country. That's not happening in my home, that doesn't happen on my property but it does, doesn't it? Slavery benefited all of America just because you lived in the North didn't mean you didn't benefit from it. What happens now with our administration, right or wrong is not the issue, it's the process, it's the process. What happens now has a lot to do with how much we reach out and make our voices known. I have spoken at churches in Los Angeles and across the United States where the entire congregations are told not to vote. To be in this world, but not sof it. Have you ever heard that? Don't concern yourself for politics. Don't concern yourself with what goes on in your workplace, just get that money and take it because the Lord's gonna help you. You know, there is a large chunk of American society that we are leaving behind. So that means, that those of us who know what the issues are need to be very, very active. Reaching out means that whatever you see something that's intolerable you have to speak out and I hope that you were all speaking through your congress persons, through your senators, through you e-mails, through your phone, through telegrams and letters. All of those forms of communication make a big difference to reaching out. You also have to reach out to the media. The media is one of the number one forms of stereotypes that we have. The most potent in our world today. I just returned from India, it's my second trip and I was, in a delegation from the National Institute of Mental Health. We're getting ready to do AIDS research a, India will have a largest rate of Aids by the year 2005. It will surpass Africa. It's really a critical problem and I turned on their version of MTV and I saw some of the videos and some of the television programs and the stereotypes of people of color are really, really very toxic. They have uh, Amos 'n' Andy type uh, program zone, extremely old programs where people of color are all in servitude. And you know when they saw me first(ph) well they couldn't figure me out, and then secondly I said who, you know, what my heritage was and they, I guess went back to their stereotypes, "Well hmm, you don't look like African-Americans I said, "Well, you know African-Americans look all kinds of ways, all kinds." "Well, you don't speak like." You know we had to go through it breaking down those stereotypes because you know in the world if you turn on the television and I know some of you travel all over like I do you'll see why people don't understand what goes on here. When I went to Africa last year some African women took me aside and said, "Why are you so white?" And I said, "What do you mean?" They said, "Well, you're not our color." I said, "True." I said, "Do you know what happened to us?" (laughing)

GAIL WYATT  And these ladies, educated ladies said, "We thought you all got on the boat, got off and pretty much got jobs." I said, "Oh yeah, we have jobs." (laughing) So I have to tell my story and teach my lessons to my African brothers and sisters who were unclear on what happened to us. And when I talked to them I realized the leaders, the chiefs, the strongest people, the artisans, the, the, the talents were taken from Africa to America and other parts of deist world. They suffered because they lost. We in America talked about how disconnected we are. I didn't realized how disconnected they are from understanding what happened to us when we got here. So there's a lot of educating, there's a lot of reaching out we have to do within our own groups because all over are some, from somewhere, and all, and, you know the perceptions that other people have about us is based on what they read and what they see, and what they see is a distortion of our reality. So I, when I explain my heritage you know they said, "Hah". And it was clear to me how much more visiting we need to do. I went with the largest delegation of Africans since slavery 900 African-Americans went in a series of planes back to Africa last summer. That was the largest group that had ever come back since we left and change, and when we all got there we all just stood there and cried because they said, "Welcome home." And we didn't really know that we were home but I was okay. It was home, it was, that I'll take the whole continent because the, because the connection has to be there and I have to reach out to African-Americans and African descended people and Africans to tell my stories and teach my lessons too. It's not like you meet a Latino who's from your hometown and they'll know your stories. Have you ever heard, seeing someone in therapy who was from your ethnic group and they said, "You know what it's like to be this or that, the other," and you have to look there and say, "Hmm, you know actually I don't." I'm not the expert of your experience you must tell me what that experiences. Just 'coz we look alike doesn't mean I know what your experience was. So you must teach me your stories and tell your lessons. We have to reach back because it's not just about volunteering it's about actually pulling people with you. You gotta see the results of your labor by these young people that you nurture. And if you don't nurture them and you just get your degree and you go on and celebrate that's not enough you haven't done your duty. We're all interconnected and when I see the young people in the audience that I know I helped to raise I'm so proud, I know it makes me taller 'coz I'm not just standing on the shoulders of all those people who helped me somebody standing on mine, and that's what a nice weight to have, isn't it? You gotta know what it feels like for people to go on, to push back and you have to reach back. You have to reach back it's part of your degree. You have to model not only how to be a psychologist. You have to model how to be a person. We talked about it at lunch. I talked to women about how they get married, have kids, and have a career. My gay friends say how to, how to live a responsible lifestyle and take care of family and have a career, and sometimes raised children too. All of these have to have a balance life. And one thing Dicks went there for me a long time ago was that he encourage me to write an article about making tenure. He knew that it's important to get these things out that's probably one of the most requested pieces of things I've ever written, 'coz yes(ph), he said, "Put it down, just ten things on what to do in making tenure(ph)." The whole process is extremely important so we have to reach back. We have to reach up. We have to develop policy. You don't like what you see in APA you need to run for an office. You don't like what you see in congress you need to run for it. I have a colleague Gloria Romero who just won assembly uhm, seat. I'm so proud of Gloria. She's a Ph.D. (applause) I said, "Go girl." She and I do research together. Gloria was tired up to here right, issues about women, issues about ethnic people, issues about health, healthcare access. She took the time, she run for office, she was first on a community college board and she went for it, and she won. Now she's taking our issues to Sacramento. This is what we need more of, she's a model, she's a model, she's a mom, she's an advocate everyday, she's a fantastic mom, she's a great role model for me 'coz I can call her up and say, "Gloria, can you do something about this or that and the other?" It's great to have people like that. Reaching up means you have to change policy believed me it's not enough just to teach. You have to do the research or you have to be a part of the research team that can take it and do congressional testimony, they can actually see something happened. That's when we can change what we don't like and what we want to see differently. Sense of family holidays and rituals are extremely important but we also have to involved the media in documenting everyday life from multicultural populations. What they see is a stereotype. there's a new cartoon series on, I don't know if you seen it, it's African-American family. I don't know the name of it, I probably don't want to know the name of it. P.J.? Look forward then quickly turn away if you're a Nielsen family. (laughing) Incredible, incredible hair is thick and straight up you know behind is huge and huge lips. You know those pieces of our body are find on somebody else. It's just amazing to see the level of safe hat, say, self-hatred and misunderstanding to allow these programs to continue so there I go again with my letter writing, and when my kids were little they had to write letters with me so we could all put them in one big family envelope, you know, it's a part of modeling but the issue is reach up, change it, get to APA, and I'm gonna talk about APA. One of the things that I think you can do with changing identity and responsibility is to change the way in which the research is conduct. And I didn't talk about this all day and I'm gonna be brief 'coz I know my time is short, but this is one thing I want Division 45 to consider and we're gonna talk about it tomorrow in our executive committee. So one thing I want all the other divisions who have representatives here to talk about, address this issue, 97 percent of the research is done on people of colors, done on people who are not of color. How did all those people get to know so much about people of color. If you've been the part of the evolution of the multiculturalism issue how did 97 percent of those people get to know so much about the people, they don't. And that's not true of everybody but the issue is research in the United States is granted. It's approved and funded if you have a good theory, if you know about measures and you know how to write. It doesn't require that you know anything about the people that you study. Most of the measures in psychology are developed on white, middle-class college students, aren't they? Most of them, most of the research is done, is conducted on white, middle-class college students. Do we all aspire to be white, middle-class college students? (laughing) Only one in the four people in America go to college. Why have we allowed people to define our reality by allowing this to continue not only do we need multiculturalism in our classrooms we need it in our research, we need to require that researchers have a knowledge of culture and the issues that influence people's behaviour within a cultural context. It's not an option it should be a requirement. I have people calling me saying, "I'd like you to be a consultant on my grant. It's due in a week so all I need for you to do," have you heard this before? 

00:45:20
 Yes(ph). 

00:45:20
GAIL WYATT "Is write me a letter of support saying that you consult with me on the fact that I'm doing research on African- American men and women." And I said, "Well, good luck to you but I will not consult with you." Why? I said because I think that study in African-Americans is a basic part of what you should be doing. And if you need me to consult you're in trouble. I should be on the team. I said I only will participate in research if I'm the principal investigator or one of the co-investigators. I'm not a consultant. You can't consult on the group. How do you know how to develop the sampling, how do you know which measures to select, how do you know, how, what kind of language interpretations, how do you know how to train your interviewers, how do you know how to analyze your data? You can't control for income, can you? Think about it, how can you control for income when you're taking a rich person and a poor person in the sample. You can't statistically wipe away what it means if you haven't hear(ph), ever had anything. You can't control for homelessness and put people who have lived in homes and people never had a home. There's a quality here we're missing. Let's not be so concrete and simplistic and then wonder why all people of color look so bad in research. They look bad 'coz we don't know how to study them. (applause) 

00:46:50
[sil.] 

00:46:50
GAIL WYATT  And it's sobering, it's sobering. It scares you when I want to. I wanna make you think about it because what you're learning is a very traditional paradigm of how to do research on people who pretty much look like the person who's teaching it or the people who taught them when they went to school. You have to come from some other place, you have to challenge your professors and say well, you know, either I don't have the right kind of, of mentorship here so maybe I shouldn't do this project and I should do something else or I need you to call in somebody who really can help me. Well, most, mostly that's not gonna happened. You'll not gonna call in somebody else who can help them what you have to do is get out of school so that you can do things differently but no, that APA has a role and a responsibility to speak to NIH. Of all of the large organizations they can do it. APA can do it and we need to be devoting more time and energy to this because in the year 2000 you're going to be doing, those of you who haven't started yet you're gonna be doing work to undo some of the stuffs that's been done, aren't you? It's taking me my whole career to undo some of the, the work that's been done on sexuality about African-Americans and Latinos and to tell people that a lot of what they were seeing had to do with income or cultural differences. So there's a lot to be done but we have to understand how to do it and I want APA to get involved in this issue. Ninety seven percent of people who were studying ethnic minorities could be studying them for the right reasons. I think we need to have more of an input on how people uh, train and the requirements that they need to have when they write a grant. And when I read grants I look to see, do they have any knowledge in their résumé, do they have any knowledge of the group that they're talking about or have they just study them. If they don't have any knowledge that's a fatal flop. If you just picked a measure that has good reliability and validity on college students that's a fatal flop. And you don't do anything with it, I just had a colleague come to me the other day and say you know I used my measure, it's being used all over the world, has good reliability and validity and I used it with Latinos and it didn't work. The reliability and validity was like point four. I said, "That's because it doesn't have anything to do with their reality." (laughing) Hundreds of thousands of dollars later this was a conclusion that was come to. We can be more economically expendable net(ph), can't we? It's time for us to take back the expectation that culture isn't important that we're alike, that we're all a melting pot. We were make salad, we are vegetable soup, we're diverse and our strength is in that diversity. It's time for us to understand the social justice agendas have to come out of you're taking the risk like Tommy said this morning. Take a risk, step beyond, do something different. Get people to do it with you if you're afraid to do it alone. Don't let anybody tell you that it's not offensive when people are hurt around you. Don't let anybody tell you that you're not terrorized when you see colleagues that are brushed away in one stroke 'coz you know it could happened to any of us. Don't let anybody tell you we're not vulnerable as people. Everybody in this room can loose their jobs, get kicked out of school, their home, be sick, get AIDS, you name it, it can happened. Don't let anybody tell you it's not important to verify your experience to validate it and write about it and advocate the change. Don't let anybody tell you that we're not connected. Unlike we did this morning as I end I want you to stand and I want you to connect yourselves one more time. Stand up and hold the hand of the person next to you. Our identity, our responsibility, our sense of family are not static. I want you to think right now about your ancestors, those people you knew, close your eyes if you need to. Think about those people who sacrificed for you. Think about those people who probably you didn't know but who said I'm gonna know that somebody in my family is gonna do better than me and you are it. Think about what it's gonna mean for you to be a grandmother or a grandfather or an uncle or a brother one day or somebody that you don't have total control of and you can't grade and you can't supervise in therapy but who you just might touch. Just by knowing them just by loving them, just by helping them. Think about the person whose hand you're holding. When we can tell their story and teach their lessons and they don't have to say anything that's when we know we are true multicultural society because each of us ought to know when they look in our eyes, my pain, my suffering, my hope, my fears, my joys and my strengths, and my belief that God is in this room standing with our ancestors, saying, "Go forward, don't you turn around." Thank you so much. Thank you. (applause) 

00:52:35
[sil.] 

00:52:35
  I always tell my women clients just talked through your tears and this is one woman who knows how to do that. (laughs) She's gonna take about five minutes of comments or questions so come to the mike if you'd like. 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:53:35
GAIL WYATT  Please talk to me. (laughing) 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:45
GAIL WYATT  Yes. No. Yes. 

00:53:50
 I don't have a question I just have uh, compliment and I think a message for everybody because in academia in particular we throw around a lot of terms sometimes they are difficult to describe itself by experience and I have to say that this has been a living experience base definition of a transformative experience. 

00:54:25
GAIL WYATT Thank you(ph). 

00:54:25
 Thank you. (applause) 

00:54:30
[sil.] 

00:54:30
  I do have a question uhm, uhm, you discussed uhm, self-hatred and I think uh, self-acceptance is something that we're all uh, dealing with Latino uhm, maybe, could you say a few more things about self-acceptance and particularly as we sometimes fall off short with the market that we'd like to meet. 

00:55:00
GAIL WYATT  It's a very important issue. It, it's part of self-hatred uhm, I guess learning to see the parts of you that you don't like and learning how to work it and reframe it so that you do accept it. You don't have to like everything about you uh, but you do have to accept it and I think part of it is identifying first the things that you really aren't comfortable with and then moving beyond that. I think that's where therapist can really play a role. A lot of people come to me because they really don't like being black that has to be the bottom line. They just figure you know I'm so bright, I have so many gifts but I just didn't have this thing, you know, but just bugs me down every time I go in the meeting somebody tells a racial joke and I gotta do something or not do something in either way I'm not comfortable. You know helping people to move beyond self-hatred uh, and see things as a celebration I think we're people of color or people because God made us that way. I think I'm who I am because God has something for me to do. And so I have all the attributes of those things God wants me to take care of so I can deal with them. And I think we have to really helped people. Self-acceptance is good but you know some people say I have accepted my self but you know it's developmental, isn't it? You can accept yourself at one stage and then you've moved to another and you think, "Ahh," you know it's not a good thing. You know when I got to be a grandmother I, I wasn't sure I really like this because my vision of a grandmother is somebody who can cook. (laughing) You know And who has these large arms like my grandmothers did and you could rest on them in church you know. I don't wanna go either those places you know. (laughing) So I'd said to myself I think and then here was this grandmother thing and so I'm saying to you that because you are feeling good today doesn't mean when you get back you know you have to wrestle with those same demons all over again and self-acceptance does move and adds some flows just like feelings of how it, you know, of racism moves and adds some flows, all of this is not static, it's not a dichotomous variable. 

00:57:00
[sil.] 

00:57:00
GAIL WYATT  Oh. 

00:57:10
[sil.] 

00:57:10
  Hello. 

00:57:15
GAIL WYATT Hello. 

00:57:15
 Thank you very much it was very inspiring. Thank you for making me remember my father and my grandparents, (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
GAIL WYATT Yes. 

00:57:20
 ...all my ancestors. Uhm, one of the, my que, my question is how do you, what recommendations do you have about getting energy to do all those things? (laughing) Uhm, you know I'm thinking about writing those letters and you know those letters to the newspaper and... (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

00:57:35
 ...you know talking to my chancellor and fighting... (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

00:57:40
 ...my uh, you know the directors of the programs and you know whatever, fighting all the battles and then also teaching the classes... (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

00:57:45
 ...and reading those dissertation proposals and (laughing) you know correcting the grammar on them and you know. (laughing) All of those things and so I guess you know I just wonder what, what insights you have about, how to do that because you seem like someone that has been able to, to do that? Uhm, and so maybe you can give some insight to the rest of us. 

00:58:05
GAIL WYATT  Well, that's a good question uhm, I think we have to create our own reality and form supportive bodies around us. I have uh, friendship groups that write letters with me so if I get too tired they kind of keep me going. I have a family, a nuclear family and I have a family I have made up of people some of whom are psychologists and they helped me going on some of the issue, you know other issues. We, we in other words I've, I, I decompartmentalize my life so that I can continue to do what I do. And sometimes I'm just a member of the group I'm not leaving it I'm just there. And sometimes too tired and someone else helps me to do what it is I need to do. I also think you need to exercise uh, and I know this is not a part of my culture, I'm the first generation in my family to exercise, you know something? The first generation of people who think that it's okay to sweat. (laughing) You see because from southern parents if a lady sweats then she's not a lady. You see this, you, it's funny but think about it for woman to come out of a gym all grungy with sweat and her hair all wet is completely out of culture for me. So I think part of my energy comes from realizing that you know I have to, I have to keep my self very physically strong, I'm also very spirited person. And uh, God is definitely at my center and I think for me God is just, keeps telling me I have a job to do and I do it 24/7 uhm, I don't stop, I don't know how long I have so I'm gonna, you know when I go out of here they all gonna say, "whew". You know (laughing) 'coz you burn this all out but I think that's what we all do. Remember that little poem you learned in junior high school, my candle burns at both ends. It will not last the night but on my foes and on my friends it gives a lovely light. Think about that. Yes. 

01:00:00
  You just uh, touch on something I wanted to say, I really appreciate specially at that last place of spirituality. (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
 Uhm, I think in terms of energy I've uh, slowly have come to the conclusion that I've made, I, I happened to be a director of a child and family development center and we make tremendous amount of appointments for all sorts of people that come through our center... (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:00:25
 ...to meet their needs. And just this past week realized that we needed to make an appointment with Jesus at our center. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
 And so that has been uh, uh, setting time aside for the spiritual dimension. (crosstalk) 

01:00:40
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
 I think that level of spirituality which I think for any of us at any place we were at makes a different. I appreciate from you and Doctor Parham and everyone else that has exemplified that kind of spirit and love that is here. So thank you again. 

01:00:55
GAIL WYATT  Thank you. (applause) 

01:01:00
[sil.] 

01:01:00
GAIL WYATT  Uh hmm. Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
 Uhm, I had just to, a, a question of you and I know you can speak well to it is many causes and I have been lamenting that we don't hear enough about the children. 

01:01:15
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:01:15
 We talked about the toxity(ph) and, toxicity in the environment from all of these "isms" and I'd like to hear your, a few words from you about the effect on identity development on our minority kids. 

01:01:25
GAIL WYATT That's a really important topic. Uhm, I'm very concerned about our children and that's why I talked about you know creating our, our own reality in writing, uhm, writing children's books I think our children really are at a tremendous disadvantage. It's a very confusing to grow up in today's world with so much available and yet racism and sexism and homophobia are still very much should be(ph) and I think our children missed the fact that we worked so hard that they don't hear the stories and we don't teach the lessons. Uhm, it's extremely important to tell children and to remind them on a daily basis that whole sense of family is a good way to do it of, of where their ancestors come, have come from and where they need to go. You can't know where you're going until you know where you've been you know and I constantly tell my children that even now, don't forget you know, when we vote we vote as a family, it's a celebration and they used to scream when they were little. "Why do we have to go?" And I said, "Because so many people didn't have a chance to go. I want you to go and you can play on my legs which is what they do, stepped on my feet and play on my legs then I could vote until they got bigger and bigger and they can actually see you know the ballot. And then now they go, and they go and they dragged me if I'm too tired. We have to make our children an extension of our heritage. And sometimes we think we can just do it on holidays but it has to be for every issue. Uh, on what's in happening in Washington goes on, when there's any kind of legislation there has to be a family meal, there has to be an opportunity to discuss and let children talk. Let them explain how they see it. We, you'll be surprised and appalled they are now distorted. Their perceptions can be because they don't understand, you know. My children don't understand why I won't go in Ho, Howard Johnson's. I won't go, I won't go, I won't go to Denny's. I don't care if I'm starving to death. I'll go to them, you know I'll drag on uhm, because of what I remember when I was little you know I, I, there's a lot of advantages of having, of being old. (laughing) You know 'coz you, 'coz nobody can tell you it didn't happened and you gotta remember to tell them even when they're little tell them. When I was your age I couldn't go to the bathroom when we travel across the country. My mother had a little pot and tissue and that's how we went. You know when they talked, "This bathroom is dirty." I said. "Hey, you're in it." (laughing) You know. Yes. 

01:03:55
 Let me start of by thanking you for the inspiring message. 

01:04:00
GAIL WYATT Thank you. 

01:04:00
 You touch upon the lack of information that uh, our African sisters uhm, exhibited during your visit. Uhm, Omani(ph) (inaudible ) to this country from... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:04:15
 ...the continent and I have experienced a lack of information on this end. (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:04:20
 And I think that there has existed and still exist a huge chiasm so how do we begin to breach that? 

01:04:30
GAIL WYATT It, it's so important, isn't it? And it just doesn't happened with African descended people. It's people who have a country of origin and just need to sit down and talked. I have Irish ancestors as well, and I wish I knew more, and I knew more of them the ones I know. And you know it, to sit down and talk to them about their experience and how they feel about their grandfather who had sex with (inaudible ) you know it's just as an important to me as for me to tell them what it feels like for me to not know anything about being partly Irish. You know we really need to sit down, I have potlucks where everybody comes and take, brings a dish and we sit down and we talked about these issues. Uh, the book has given me a wonderful opportunity to talk to people in this way but just take the people you work with and have a potluck and sit down and said, "Let's talk about our ancestors." It gives people completely different depth of understanding and appreciating, and respect for you when they understand how differently or how similarly you were raised, and how you see the world. Just take little groups at a time. One more question, yes. 

01:05:35
  I wanted to say that uh, I was very moved by your talk and uhm, I'm a second generation Korean-American. 

01:05:45
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:05:45
 Uhm, my parents immigrated back in '66. And my father came to this country to get a Ph.D.A. 

01:05:55
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:05:55
 And was unable to do that. Uh, he chose to uh, uh, well, he stops school because I came along uh, I was a bit of surprise. 

01:06:05
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
 Uhm, so in some ways my father has lived precariously through me... (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:06:10
 ...in wanting me so much to get this degree. 

01:06:15
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
 And at times it is felt like a burden... (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
  because there's so much pressure to, to get the degree. I will be the first Ph.D. in my, my, in my family. 

01:06:25
GAIL WYATT Marvelous. 

01:06:25
 Uhm, but I have felt like it was, it has been a burden and I'm here at the last stages, I'm working with my dissertation and have, had the mind set of wanting to just finished and make some money. 

01:06:40
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:06:40
 And I felt, (laughing) some people can understand that. Uhm. 

01:06:45
GAIL WYATT Just finish and make some money. (laughs) 

01:06:50
 But in, in many ways I've, I lost the, the passion and the challenge and the uh, the responsibility, the social responsibility to, to offer something and I know that I have a lot to offer... (crosstalk) 

01:07:05
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:07:05
 ...but I have felt very challenge recently of feeling like it's such a burden. 

01:07:10
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:07:10
 Uhm, my father had said many at times, "Hurry up and finish your degree because the Korean community is waiting." 

01:07:20
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:07:20
 And I just have felt so conflicted about that... (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
GAIL WYATT Uh hmm. 

01:07:25
 ...but I just wanna thank you because I feel like I have been inspired today and feeling like... (crosstalk) 

01:07:35
GAIL WYATT Thank God. 

01:07:35
 ...it's not enough just to get the degree and make some money. Thank you. 

01:07:40
GAIL WYATT You're very welcome. (applause)
