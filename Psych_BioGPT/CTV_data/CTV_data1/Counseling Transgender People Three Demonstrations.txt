Microtraining Associates presents Counseling Transgender People: Three Demonstrations 

00:00:00
Kevin Nadal, Ph.D. 

00:00:45
KEVIN NADAL Hi, my name is Kevin Nadal and I'm an associate professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the City University of New York. Today, I will be conducting three individual counseling sessions with three different people who identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. In the fifth edition of the diagnostic statistical manual of psychiatric disorders, it was announced that gender identity disorder would be replaced with gender dysphoria. This change is remarkable because many scholars and advocates have noted that labeling someone's gender identity as a disorder demonstrates that the mental health profession views transgender and gender non-conforming people as mentally ill or deficient. Despite this change, it is likely that many counselors and clinician have limited experience or training in working with transgender and gender non-conforming people. Thus, the purpose of this video is to provide some effective and culturally competent techniques in counseling clients in this population. Before we began, it's important for us to identify some key terms that may come up throughout the video. First, gender identity is a person's sense of identification as male, female, both, or neither. Gender identity is independent of sexual orientation which is an individual sense of personal and social identity based on sexual romantic attractions, behaviors, expressing those attractions, and the identity they have results from those attractions and behaviors. For instance, a person may identify as transgender woman which would be her i-- gender identity but she may be attracted to those who are opposite of her gender which would be her sexual orientation, making her a heterosexual transgender woman. A transgender man may identify as a transgender male, a F to M or a female to male or he simply may identify as a man. Similarly, a transgender woman may identify as a transgender female, an M to F or male to female or she simply may identify as a woman. Sometimes transgender people undergo medical treatment in order to physically transition to the gender that they identify with. For example, many transgender people may take hormones, some may have plastic surgeries, and some may go through both. However, some transgender people may not seek any treatment at all and may simply be comfortable with their birth reproductive organs. Either way, a person's gender presentation or the ways that a person may be perceived because of her or his gender may have an influence on the way that a person may be treated. Finally, some people may identify as gender non-conforming and that they do not identify as male or female. These individuals sometimes identify as GNC which stands for gender non-conforming. Other times they may identify as genderqueer or simply as having no gender. I mention all these terms in order to provide a context for the clients that you're about to see in the video. As you meet these clients, please pay attention to the ways that their gender identity may affect their lives as well as the ways that their gender presentations may affect how others view them. Also think about the many, many ways that being transgender has influenced their mental health, their relationship with others, and the types of everyday problems that they may face in the world. Thanks a lot and I hope you enjoy the videos. 

00:03:55
Client 1: Jude Queer = An umbrella term to describe people who are not heterosexual and are part of the LGBT community, but may not identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender Cisgender or Cis = Gender conforming 

00:03:55
KEVIN NADAL Our first client is Jude, a Latino transgender male in his 30s who discuss us issues he is having in his workplace. First, he describe some of his experiences of coming out to a supervisor and co-workers. Some of these co-workers identify as queer which is an umbrella term to describe people who are not heterosexual and part of the LGBT community, but who may not necessarily identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Others of these co-workers are Cisgender or Cis which refers to people who are gender conforming or non-transgender. Next, Jude describes some of his experiences with his co-workers that make him face some subtle bias or discomfort. In the literature we may refer to these incidents as microaggressions. 

00:04:40
Microaggressions 

00:04:40
KEVIN NADAL With microaggressions, individuals are sometimes unaware of their hurtful or discriminates, or behavior. However, as you will see in the video, microaggressions often leave the individual feeling in array of negative emotions. 

00:04:50
KEVIN NADAL So Jude, it's good seeing you again. Uhm, - 

00:04:55
JUDE It's good to see you, too. 

00:04:55
KEVIN NADAL - and I wanted just check in on you. In the last time you told me a little bit about, you know, what's been going on for you. Particularly, coming out and transitioning, and, and things like that so, so how have you been? 

00:05:05
T = Testosterone. A hormone that may FTM's use in their gender transition 

00:05:05
JUDE A bit okay. Uhm, I'd been feeling really good. Uhm, ah, you know, I just start a T at the beginning of the year, uhm, even though I've been sort of how(ph) and identified for almost five years now. Uhm, so this, uhm, start in T has prompted for me obviously, uhm, you know, that sort of next level of coming out for myself, right? Coming out as a process and - 

00:05:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:05:40
RAY - you know, it's (inaudible ) but you're really a sort of life-long process. 

00:05:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:05:45
RAY Uhm, ah, and so work has been kind of a big focus for me, uhm, just in terms of, uhm, I'm out to some people there. But I haven't come out to everybody and so that's been sort of my, uhm, journey as of late to sort of really just come out to folks at work, uhm. 

00:06:10
KEVIN NADAL But will you tell me a little bit about your workplace and, you know, how you feel there and what types of, of relationships that you have in people there? 

00:06:15
JUDE Sure. Uhm, I've been working there for-- again, almost five years. It's interesting. I started there, uhm, at a point where I was just on the cost of, of coming out. Uhm, and it's a small nonprofit and, ah, when I first started there, there was some more queer folks there than they are now. But, uhm, the ED was, was queer and she, I knew her from another, uhm, job and so it was really, uhm, it's really an open sort of place, environment. Uhm, really progressive folks. Uhm, you know, who obviously were open in embracing of my sort of gender presenting, right? 

00:07:05
Jude uses "Passing" as passing as a male 

00:07:10
JUDE Uhm, you know, I think as first, even though I've always sort of pass and then maybe not, uhm, you know, they were comfortable with seeing as a sort of masculine female, I imagine. Uhm, but, ah, slowly I made good friendships there and I started to come out to some people who are, who are I was close to when I felt like, uhm, close to and I told them, you know, I asked them to refer to me as he that, that was my, uhm, pronoun preference. 

00:07:45
Cis Female = Female who was born with female reproductive organs and who identifies as female 

00:07:45
JUDE Uhm, the one, ah, friend who I first came out to actually, ah, she's a Cis female Latina and one, one time we're in office and she was like blah, blah, uhm, I don't know she said mama or she said-- she refer to me in some Latino kind of like term that's like a term of endearment. And she paused because I'm must have like, at that point when I was getting refer to a she, it was like there's sort of involuntary like internal cringe. 

00:08:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:25
JUDE You know, what I mean and it was like wow - 

00:08:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:25
JUDE - you know, that's not me. You know, uhm, and then later we went for a drink and I started to talk to her about it and she was like I knew it. She was like she felt that that moment too. She was like wait a minute that doesn't even sound right to me. 

00:08:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:45
JUDE Uhm, so it was really like one of the first really, uhm, gre-- I've, I've had a lot good experiences. I gotta say I gonna knock on wood. I think my experience so far is probably, uhm, you know, more different than that. 

00:09:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:09:00
JUDE Uhm... 

00:09:05
KEVIN NADAL And the people then supportive and... 

00:09:05
JUDE Because the people have been-- have, have for the most part. 

00:09:05
KEVIN NADAL Further most part, okay. 

00:09:10
JUDE I've only experience support but work was always, you know, it's a, it's a different, it's a different realm and it's sort of gave me pause at times. 

00:09:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:25
JUDE Because you never know, uhm, how people are gonna react and that's, you know, your life's blood, you know. And unfortunately, I know a lot of trans people and that's a big thing for trans people is, you know, work place discrimination. 

00:09:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:09:45
JUDE Uhm, so, you know, I started slow when I started to come out to people who I had to begi-- began to develop friendships with outside of work. 

00:10:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:10:00
JUDE Uhm... 

00:10:00
KEVIN NADAL And these are non-trans people and... 

00:10:05
JUDE Non-trans people and for the most part non-queer people. 

00:10:05
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:10:05
JUDE It's pretty, uhm, yeah, they were-- like I said, they were few, uhm, queer folks when I first started. 

00:10:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:15
JUDE But there's have been some turn over and - 

00:10:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:20
JUDE - uhm, right now I think I'm the only queer person that works, you know. Am I? Yeah. Uhm. 

00:10:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:35
JUDE Uhm, so yeah, it was, it was sort of a, a slow process and it's sort of just weird in my process. You know, I, I think I was doing a lot of internal to external, uhm - 

00:10:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:45
JUDE - you know, was dealing with this issues inside and with people that I felt comfortable with and then slowly was starting to, you know, - 

00:10:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:11:00
JUDE - come out in sort of to the world. 

00:11:00
KEVIN NADAL So did you come out to all of your co-workers now? 

00:11:05
JUDE Uhm, not yet. Uhm, recently though the big, I think, step for me was to come out to my direct supervisor. 

00:11:15
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:11:15
JUDE Uhm, she and I had also known each other from my previous workplace. 

00:11:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:11:20
JUDE Uhm, like the ED I had mention before , uhm, and but she and I had sort of, uhm, have the sort of contingent relationship as of late and it had nothing to do with my identity. It just sort of how to do it? How our personalities match? 

00:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:11:40
JUDE You know, being supervisor and, and things like that. Uhm, so I sort of-- I guess now that I think about it, it sort-- it was sort of like a little, a little bit like parental where I was acting out and sort of resented her in a way so for that reason I probably wasn't sharing with her - 

00:12:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
JUDE - something very personal. And, uhm, and I guess almost merely like with my, my, my parents like I wanted her to ask me. 

00:12:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:12:20
JUDE Where there were people around me that were referring to me as he and openly, they, they, they weren't hiding it. It was like Jude, he blah, you know, and it's, it's just interesting how some people picked up and some people didn't. 

00:12:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Right. 

00:12:30
JUDE Uhm, so with my boss, uhm, we already check in and a relationship has, you know, I've been consciously working on our, my relationship with her cuz obviously, it affects your work and, uhm, so we were in a check-in and, uhm, I was wearing, ah, a shark's, shark tooth necklace - 

00:12:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:12:55
BDSM = Bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, masochism 

00:12:55
JUDE - and, uhm, she joked and was like, oh, that, that looks like, uhm, something from this artists from the 80s who did a lot of BDSM stuff and we have a lot of photographs of like tightly wrap, you know, testicles and, and so I found that ironically as a great segue. 

00:13:15
KEVIN NADAL Oh, sure. 

00:13:15
JUDE I was like, oh, well, now that you mention this masculine thing on my neck. Uhm, so I was like, you know, I recently, uhm, started hormones and I'm transitioning and, you know, I just sort of put it out there. 

00:13:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:35
JUDE And she was like super receptive, you know, and she was like wow, that's really great. I'm really happy for you. Uhm, you know, and I told her a little bit about what have been going on. 

00:13:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:50
JUDE And that, uhm, I was slowly coming out and that I was, you know, using, you know, my pronoun, well she-- I think she asked me about the pronoun. She's like so you want me to refer to you as he and I was like yes. 

00:14:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:14:05
JUDE And she's like, oh, you know, John, John, ah, is another supervisor in our group who works more with the department event - 

00:14:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:14:15
JUDE - ah, folks but he is the, the head of another team. And she had mentioned she's like yeah, John asked me, his team asked him what should we be referring to Judas. 

00:14:30
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:14:30
JUDE Because obviously, some people were picking up on the fact that - 

00:14:35
KEVIN NADAL Others were using, yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:35
JUDE - some, others was-- were using he for me. And she told him, she's like, well, I don't know. I asked Jude. Uhm, which I think was a good sort of reaction but then I wonder why she never asked me himself. 

00:14:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Right, right. 

00:14:55
JUDE Uhm, but I guess that's some other deep of radiant(ph) thing we have going on. Uhm - 

00:15:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:00
JUDE - ah. 

00:15:00
KEVIN NADAL Well, let me just pause for you for a second - 

00:15:05
JUDE Sure. 

00:15:05
KEVIN NADAL - she says she will always like for her to be receptive to you. 

00:15:05
JUDE It was relief. 

00:15:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:10
JUDE You know, I don't know that I would have expected anything else. 

00:15:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-huh. 

00:15:15
JUDE But you know you start dreaming stuff up in your head. You just - 

00:15:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:20
JUDE - never, you just never know. It's a, it's a scary thing I think regardless. 

00:15:25
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:25
JUDE Uhm, but it was, it was a relief and I think it definitely help to shift our relationship a little bit more. 

00:15:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:30
JUDE Uhm... 

00:15:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:30
Ally = Supportive of one's identity 

00:15:35
JUDE And obviously, her, being my supervisor, I know she's gonna be an ally. 

00:15:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:15:40
JUDE Or I would hope. 

00:15:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Sure. 

00:15:40
JUDE Uhm... 

00:15:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and I think it's really important. I had just to say that. You know, even though you've had this supportive experiences it's complete natural normal to feel hesitant in coming out to people. Cuz you-- you're right, you never know how people are gonna react. 

00:15:55
JUDE Absolutely. 

00:15:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, so you've been fortunate to have some good experiences and, and then a new good experience to add to that list. 

00:16:00
JUDE Right. 

00:16:00
KEVIN NADAL Uhm, ah, you know, it's completely natural to, to be hesitant in, in coming out. 

00:16:05
JUDE Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, it's definitely the beginning of the row for me I think. 

00:16:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:10
JUDE Uhm, even though it's been a while - 

00:16:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:15
JUDE - uhm, I think, uhm, you know, another experience I had was maybe not bad but was different, uhm - 

00:16:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:30
JUDE - and I, so I work in-- on a floor where-- with two small nonprofits and, you know, the bath-- there's-- the bathrooms are gender that there's - 

00:16:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:40
JUDE - female and the male bathroom, uhm, and I work there for a couple of years and because I was in a sort of tenuous place with wearing how I was identify, I was using the female bathroom. 

00:16:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:55
JUDE Uhm, but obviously now I'm at the different place with being out and that doesn't feel comfortable to me. 

00:17:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:00
JUDE As a matter of fact one, ah, another co-worker of mine who had whom had to come out too and, uhm, she really like in the middle where the desk at and she was like, I was going to the bathroom with her and she laughs out loud and was like oh, how funny I'm going to woman's bathroom with Jude. 

00:17:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:17:25
JUDE And I had laughed but I took pause - 

00:17:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:17:30
JUDE - because I'm like, yeah, you're right. 

00:17:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:30
JUDE Uhm, it's weird. 

00:17:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:35
JUDE Uhm, you know, I, I don't know that I was offended. It just make me, it just had me take pause. 

00:17:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:17:45
JUDE And I think she probably realized after that she probably shouldn't have because I, I'm a jokester and - 

00:17:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:17:50
JUDE - I like to have fun or whatever but that wasn't something necessarily that I would have like shouted out - 

00:17:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:55
JUDE - to the, to the world. But anyway, the issue of the bathroom is sort of kinda something that I'm contending with right now. 

00:18:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:18:05
JUDE Uhm, and... 

00:18:05
KEVIN NADAL Have you brought it up with anybody? 

00:18:05
JUDE I've brought it up with my, the office manager. 

00:18:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:10
JUDE And he's somebody that I'm really cool with you. Uhm, we sort of connect on, you know, a lot different levels and I hadn't come out to him. But I ask him at first, I was like, oh, you know, you can find out for me if there any non-gendered bathroom in the building. 

00:18:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:18:25
JUDE Cuz I know, I've worked at places where they've always had like, you know, - 

00:18:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:18:30
JUDE - a wheelchair accessible or something that's just one bath and one stall. 

00:18:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:35
JUDE Uhm, and he's like, yeah, yeah, let me find out and he fell down, he was like, yeah, sorry, there aren't. And I was like okay, I was like, well, let me tell you what's going on with me. He was like, uhm, I don't know if you know but-- I don't know if you realized that - 

00:18:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:55
JUDE - and I'm sure he has because the first girl that I came out to were all sort of tighten so - 

00:19:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:19:00
JUDE - again, I was like you know, uhm, I'm, I'm transitioning and I'm, you know, this is where I'm at. 

00:19:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:19:10
JUDE And he was like-- uhm, I was like so, you know, the bathroom things a weird thing, you know, and he was like, "Oh, well, didn't you like about that before you did this?" Like I was like, yeah, I have to think about that every time I go to the bathroom. 

00:19:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:19:25
JUDE I'm mean and that's like the least of the issues even though it is a huge issue. That I'm contending with right now. 

00:19:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:19:35
JUDE So... 

00:19:35
KEVIN NADAL How did that feel when he said that to you? 

00:19:35
JUDE You know, it, it was, uhm, it maybe take I was just like taking a back kinda like, yeah, I'm, you know, ah, I guess it was one of the first sort of in your face, in my face things that I had to deal within that way. 

00:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:00
JUDE Uhm, so it just took me a back - 

00:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:00
JUDE - and but then I was just step back, and I'm like okay. Uhm, that was his gut reaction. 

00:20:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:10
JUDE You know, I also happen to know personally that - 

00:20:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:10
JUDE - he has a lot of issues with the bathroom like he doesn't like to go on with other Cis guys in the, the office who like hide the key. 

00:20:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:20:20
JUDE Oh, you know what I mean, so it could be personal. 

00:20:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:25
JUDE It could, and it could be he's just base reaction. 

00:20:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:20:30
JUDE Uhm, I think he's a really cool, open, you know, straight Cis guy but every all of us have, you know, things that we project - 

00:20:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:40
JUDE - about, you know, things. 

00:20:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:45
JUDE Uhm, and I know he's a little like funny with, uhm, one of, one of my co-workers had shared this video of, of this guy singing, uhm, one of Nicki Minaj songs. And he was like, it was just one of these funny, ah, viral videos. 

00:21:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:21:05
JUDE But he was a, a black queer guy who was clearly very feminine. 

00:21:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. Sure. 

00:21:15
JUDE And he was really uncomfortable - 

00:21:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:21:15
JUDE - with that video. So clearly these gender things makes, it makes him feeling uncomfortable. 

00:21:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:21:20
JUDE Uhm, so, yeah, it was something that it was like, well, okay. 

00:21:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:30
JUDE Uhm, and just made me think about like, ah, I have a pretty good relationship with a lot of the males in the office. 

00:21:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:40
JUDE Uhm, but, you know, the females that I'm out to are-- have shown a little bit more, I guess, not that they show more support. Uhm, it's just been different. 

00:21:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:55
JUDE Uhm, so... 

00:22:00
KEVIN NADAL So you haven't come out to a lot of males in the office, this Cis males? 

00:22:00
JUDE I'm-- well, I'm out to the other Cis male who I'm close to, who's also a T member. 

00:22:10
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:22:10
JUDE And he was really, he-- I mean he's a pretty like, ah, he's a dude that doesn't really show a lot of emotion to begin with. Uhm, but I was to learn through them and I was like so just talking about work and how, you know, aside from where I'm at with my gender identity, I was like thinking about moving on. 

00:22:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:35
JUDE But something that has made me take pause is that I'm in a really supportive environment right now. 

00:22:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:22:40
JUDE And what, what I'm going through right now, I was like, isn't, isn't this just the ideal place for me to do something - 

00:22:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:22:50
JUDE - to, to stay while-- for a little longer. 

00:22:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:22:55
JUDE So I took that as the end to sort of let him know and he was like, okay, yeah. He was like so you want me to call me-- call you he wherever. And I was like yeah and, you know, this and that. He was like cool, so he seems really cool and open with it. 

00:23:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:23:10
JUDE Uhm, John, the other guy who, uhm, is a supervisor. 

00:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
JUDE One day, I was just-- it was me and him, it was late in the office. He was like, oh, Jude, you're the last man standing. 

00:23:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-huh. 

00:23:25
JUDE I was like yup, so I've receive support - 

00:23:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:23:30
JUDE - in that way, uhm, from these Cis males. 

00:23:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:23:35
JUDE Uhm, you know. 

00:23:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well, I mean what I mean is that, that, you know, I just wanna share that it seems like you, you know, you feel lucky to be in a supportive environment, uhm, and so you feel good about that because as we know a lot of trans people aren't in supportive environment and so forth. 

00:23:50
JUDE Yeah. 

00:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Although the same time its sound that like you receive a lot of these weird messages, you know. Some that are, uhm, you know, like the, the guy with the bathroom situation. That might be a little bit more avert and some that might be more covert. Like for example, just the, the silence of your, your boss or your supervisor who didn't asked directly about your gender. Or went somebody had asked her about it. 

00:24:15
JUDE Right. 

00:24:15
KEVIN NADAL You know, what is it like just to experiencing these, these little subtle behaviors that might like you had mention, uhm, reflect people's, you know, own projections or maybe biases or - 

00:24:35
JUDE Yeah. 

00:24:35
KEVIN NADAL - things like that. 

00:24:35
JUDE I mean it's, it's challenging. 

00:24:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:24:35
JUDE You know, uhm, because you, you know, you have to operate on the diff-- a lot of different levels - 

00:24:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:24:45
JUDE - uhm, which can take a lot of energy - 

00:24:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:24:50
JUDE - without realizing it, you know, uhm, and, you know, uhm, it's, it's a test, a test I think of one's own strength and place where I'm at, right? 

00:25:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:25:15
JUDE Like, uhm, and sort of sounds of ripple through you - 

00:25:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:25:20
JUDE - uhm, but it's like, oh, okay, we, uhm, you know, this is who I am. Uhm, I need to stay strong in that - 

00:25:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:25:30
JUDE - you know. So it's, it's a test for me, uhm, I think it's equally, probably a test for others. 

00:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:40
JUDE Uhm, I think I'll always have to-- I think I naturally always try to catch myself in whether or not I'm projecting to, right? 

00:25:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay. Yeah. 

00:25:50
JUDE I don't wanna be that defensive guy. 

00:25:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:55
JUDE But I also don't wanna be taking stuff that I shouldn't. 

00:26:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:00
JUDE Right? 

00:26:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:00
JUDE Like I've been really open especially with people who knew for a long time. 

00:26:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:26:10
JUDE You know, and when I first started to come out and, and share my gender, pronoun preference and they'd slip and I'm like, okay, that's okay. 

00:26:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:20
JUDE You know, because I, I get it. It's, you know, uhm, but you can tell the difference with when someone is just slipping out of familiarity - 

00:26:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:30
JUDE - and when somebody is just sort of like - 

00:26:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:30
JUDE - not willing to make that switch in their head. 

00:26:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:26:35
JUDE Uhm, so that's been, it's been challenging and, and just as much a part of my process. 

00:26:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:26:45
JUDE Uhm, you know, how they say when you're in a relationship, it sort of like, you know, you mirror back to each other. 

00:26:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:50
JUDE Uhm, and I think that this process with, with others is just as much a mirror of my own inner transphobia, right? We all have internal transphobia and internal homophobia - 

00:27:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:27:05
JUDE - because that was - 

00:27:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:10
JUDE - presented to us - 

00:27:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:10
JUDE - and so par-- part of our struggle as queer people and trans people - 

00:27:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:15
JUDE - is to deal with that within ourselves - 

00:27:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:15
JUDE - and then with others. 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:20
JUDE Uhm... 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Can we explore that a little bit? Are you aware of times were you have that internalized transphobia? 

00:27:25
JUDE Yeah, uhm - 

00:27:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:30
JUDE - absolutely. 

00:27:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:27:30
JUDE Uhm... 

00:27:30
KEVIN NADAL Can you think of, ah, of an instance? 

00:27:35
JUDE Uhm, I'm trying to think of something maybe that's happened recently. 

00:27:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:27:40
JUDE Uhm, I don't know if-- well, I guess this is internalized transphobia. I was, uhm, we had an issue with a friend of mine who's trans, uhm, male and these are the two friends of mine who are Cis female but queer. 

00:28:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:28:05
JUDE Uhm, and we had an issue with him for something that happen to us personally. It was about some trip, whatever, some friend drama. 

00:28:10
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:28:15
JUDE But we had like, ah, a session. We're really like kinda like ri-- put them through the ringer - 

00:28:25
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:28:25
JUDE - and a lot of transphobic stuff came up. 

00:28:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:28:25
JUDE You know, kinda like, oh, he's such-- ah, what are some of the term that were used? Like he, you know, he's like such a girl or he, uhm, I don't know - 

00:28:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:28:40
JUDE - which just like ringing at them for being so sensitive. 

00:28:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:28:45
JUDE And like-- and then, I don't know, I took part of it just by being there - 

00:28:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:28:50
JUDE - and accepting it and sort of agreeing in some ways but then I went back and I felt really shoddy. 

00:28:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:28:55
JUDE I was like wow, that's-- and one of them actually overtly said look, I'm sorry. I'm-- I hate to get transphobic here but then went - 

00:29:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:05
JUDE - with it. 

00:29:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:10
JUDE You know, and I sort of went with it too and then it, and then it made feel really shoddy cuz I'm like - 

00:29:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:15
JUDE - oh, wait a minute, he-- I need to stand up for him - 

00:29:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:20
JUDE - and not, even though I was angry with him - 

00:29:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:25
JUDE - right? Sort of this other stuff started to come up, - 

00:29:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:30
JUDE - uhm, around that. 

00:29:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:29:30
JUDE Uhm, you know, and it just-- it was, it was ugly - 

00:29:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:35
JUDE - you know, and it just-- but it makes you look within and how that's maybe something that I'm dealing with within myself too. 

00:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:45
JUDE You know. 

00:29:45
KEVIN NADAL So how do you, how do you-- what was the process for you? So you, you went through that and you said you feel shitty. 

00:29:50
JUDE I, I think I approach my friends. Unfortunately, I'm still not talk-- were my friend, I'm still sort of only out with my friend who's trans. 

00:30:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:30:00
JUDE But I think I talk to one of the, ah, women that I was with at that time and I was like, you know, that made me feel sort of really uncomfortable. 

00:30:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:30:10
JUDE Uhm, and, you know, just talk to her about - 

00:30:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:30:15
JUDE - what that made me feel and she's like, yeah, you know - 

00:30:20
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:30:20
JUDE - I agree and, and she and I have had conversations about - 

00:30:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:25
JUDE - her transphobia like as a lesbian - 

00:30:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:30:30
JUDE - who's older. 

00:30:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:30:30
JUDE Uhm, you know, we had a, a deep conversation about that - 

00:30:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:30:35
JUDE - and, you know, uhm, so, yeah, I think it's just like a continuous process- 

00:30:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:30:50
JUDE - of having stuff sort of jump out to you. 

00:30:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:30:50
JUDE Uhm. 

00:30:55
KEVIN NADAL I mean one thing that I realize in such is you are telling me all these different stories is that, you know, there's always a lot to, to process and lot to think about and, you know, I wonder what that's like for you to have to have these all, these things on your mind. You know, in addition to the everyday stressors that you might have, you know, and what's it like to talk about these things with me right now. 

00:31:15
JUDE If feels good to talk about it. 

00:31:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:15
JUDE Uhm, I think I'm up. I, I do-- ah, I think the process is necessary. 

00:31:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:31:30
JUDE Uhm, I do like talking about it. I don't think I always notice how much energy it takes. 

00:31:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:40
JUDE Uhm, and it takes a lot of energy. 

00:31:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:45
JUDE Uhm, sometimes I wonder why I'm so tired and it's like - 

00:31:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:50
JUDE - you know, I don't know that people understands, uhm, unless you're in - 

00:31:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:55
JUDE - the work of processing - 

00:31:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:00
JUDE - of how much work, internal work is. 

00:32:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:32:00
JUDE Uhm, and it's, it's exhausting. 

00:32:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:32:05
JUDE Uhm, and it's hard to, uhm, just keep up the, the good for it. 

00:32:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:20
JUDE Right? 

00:32:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:20
JUDE Uhm, I think that as a person, I naturally try to put on the good face. 

00:32:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:32:25
JUDE You know, I've struggle with depression throughout my whole life. 

00:32:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:32:30
JUDE Uhm, but I was always the one that nobody would-- could tell oh, you're-- well, you're depressed. You know that I mean. 

00:32:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:40
JUDE Uhm, and, and that takes just as much energy I guess. 

00:32:45
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:32:45
JUDE You know. 

00:32:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:45
JUDE But it feels good to talk about it, I think it's important - 

00:32:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:50
JUDE - to, to put it on the table - 

00:32:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:32:55
JUDE - uhm, even though some of the difficult stuff is a little harder to talk about - 

00:33:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:33:00
JUDE - uhm, but it's important. 

00:33:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well, Jude, we are almost out of time and, you know, one thing that I wanted just to mention is I'm really glad that you, uhm, are coming in here. And because it sounds like, you know, what you were saying is like to be really exhausting to have to deal with all these different things. I mean, it also sounds like you're really, ah, able to, to stay aware of, of, of how you're feeling and, you know, try to have manage some of these feelings and, uhm, and so coming in here could be an opportunity for you to even just express these feelings, vent sometimes to, you know, just talk about what you're going through. So I think that that's, ah, really good strength, uhm, for you to, to be able to come here and do that. And we also talked about a lot of different things including, you know, internalized transphobia and you know, even just, you know, being aware of, of yourself in reactions to some of these, you know, subtle messages that you, you hear from others. And so I think that, you know, maybe in the upcoming weeks, uhm, as you meet with me in therapy that and we can hear to you to, to impact a lot of this stuff. You know, I think it's a-- you know, like you had mention before, it's just, uhm, we all can develop all of these internalized homophobia or transphobia, uhm, given in all the different societal messages, uhm, that are just thrown at you throughout your entire life and I think it's, you know, important for us to, to try to, uhm, to unpack those things, to process those things, and also just to, to realize that, you know, that's part of the process. You know, we can't rush these sometimes. It's just sometimes because it's, it's, it's so, uhm, huge in our lives and it's just it's, it's been there for so long that, you know, it might take a little while. And so you need to that this process, you know, might not necessarily be something we could solve overnight but something that we, you know, can try our best to, to move at a phase that you're ready to move through this. 

00:34:55
JUDE Absolutely. 

00:34:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, so how does that sound to, to go through this and to go on this journey with me and hopefully, ah, examining some of these things with me? 

00:35:05
JUDE Yeah, it's, it's, it's all those things what you said. It's exciting, it's scary, it's-- but I know that it's important and so I look forward to it as well. 

00:35:15
KEVIN NADAL Okay, thank you so much for coming in today. 

00:35:20
JUDE Thank you. 

00:35:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:35:20
Debriefing with Jude 

00:35:25
KEVIN NADAL So Jude, I just wanted to debrief with you and, and just ask you how the or what this experience was like for you? 

00:35:30
JUDE So... 

00:35:30
KEVIN NADAL What were some of the things that have, ah, people done in therapy that have been effective or maybe that I may have done today that may been effective? And what are things that may have been ineffective in therapy? 

00:35:40
JUDE Uhm, I think effective that you done in that my, my therapist, uhm, just sort of like in my process of - 

00:35:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:35:55
JUDE - extreme of consciousness, just sort of catch some, - 

00:36:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:36:00
JUDE - some issues and sort of maybe - 

00:36:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:36:05
JUDE - lead someone down the path rather than overtly state like - 

00:36:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:36:10
JUDE - and let's talk about this. 

00:36:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:36:10
JUDE Uhm, a lot of my therapist, my experience has been this, it's just a conversation and talking about it and obviously, that's how things come up and with someone who is aware, don't know, oh, that's an issue, (inaudible ) issue. But obviously, a good therapist is gonna be like oh, that's a (inaudible ) issue. Let's - 

00:36:35
KEVIN NADAL Right, and then allow you - 

00:36:35
JUDE - let's steer the car that way. 

00:36:35
KEVIN NADAL - yeah, allow you to come up with it yourself. 

00:36:40
JUDE Exactly. 

00:36:40
KEVIN NADAL And let us see yourself. 

00:36:40
JUDE Yeah. 

00:36:40
KEVIN NADAL Anything that's been ineffective in the in the past? 

00:36:40
JUDE Uhm, ineffective, I think has-- is the reverse of that - 

00:36:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:36:50
JUDE - sort of like-- cuz I have had really great experiences with my therapist. 

00:36:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:36:55
JUDE But like with the therapist before this one who was male and then it, it became sort of parental - 

00:37:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:37:05
JUDE - and there was a moment where he was like no, that's not you or - 

00:37:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:37:10
JUDE - you know, sort of very fatherly - 

00:37:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:37:10
JUDE - and I was like, ah, and that's what started to make me like sort of - 

00:37:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:37:15
JUDE - distance away. 

00:37:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah. 

00:37:15
JUDE Uhm, but I, I re-- I like the sort of let, let somebody talk. And then if they're not going anywhere, you steer the, you know what I mean - 

00:37:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:37:35
JUDE - like subtle. 

00:37:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and what's it like talking about, uhm, your experiences as a trans person with a non-trans person? 

00:37:40
JUDE Uhm, I think that, uhm, I don't know if I can say this but knowing that you're queer - 

00:37:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:37:50
JUDE - helps more - 

00:37:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Uh-hmm. 

00:37:55
JUDE - uhm, so but with somebody who's straight, ah, I don't know how. I mean my, my-- I don't know how that, that would feel. I mean I think it would feel good. 

00:38:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:38:05
JUDE Uhm, yeah, that's interesting. Ah, I guess have to think about that. 

00:38:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, right. Maybe, perhaps, if they show that they were, you know, - 

00:38:20
JUDE Open. 

00:38:20
KEVIN NADAL - open and -- 

00:38:20
JUDE Yeah. 

00:38:20
KEVIN NADAL - competent and - 

00:38:20
JUDE Yeah. 

00:38:25
KEVIN NADAL - familiar with, just amazing. 

00:38:25
JUDE Yeah. I think if I was, uhm, starting off with a therapist, uhm, it could be easy to, uhm, I could see one easily getting defensive - 

00:38:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:38:45
JUDE - if I sense something - 

00:38:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:38:50
JUDE - that was off about that - 

00:38:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:38:55
JUDE - uhm, or you could just go with it and have it being part of the process. 

00:39:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:39:00
JUDE I don't know. I think that's interesting. 

00:39:05
KEVIN NADAL All right. Well, thank you so much for being part of this process. 

00:39:05
JUDE Thank you. 

00:39:05

KEVIN NADAL Our second client is Ray. Ray who identify as trans gender queer describes the difficulties that Ray is having with Ray's family members. As mentioned previously, gender queer is a term that gender non-conforming people often identified with. Ray is presenting problem begins with Ray's feelings about Ray's mother who's having difficulty in using Ray's chosen name as well as Ray's preferred gender pronoun of a they. 

00:39:35
KEVIN NADAL So Ray tell me how you been? 

00:39:40
RAY Uhm, I have been okay. I had came back from the holiday weekend with my family. Ah, we did things giving together - 

00:39:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:39:50
RAY - and that was like interesting experience. Uhm, my family dynamic, some sort of change - 

00:39:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:40:00
RAY - since my mother has turn around a little bit in terms of her thinking about my gender in a way that she interacts at me and their family in my presence. 

00:40:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. Yeah, will you tell me a little bit more about how she has change or... 

00:40:15
RAY Yeah, so I came out to her about a year ago - 

00:40:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:40:20
Gender Queer = an identity used to describe people who are gender non-conforming Chosen name = a name people choose for themselves 

00:40:20
RAY - uhm, as gender queer and I asked her to use my chosen name which is Ray instead of my given name - 

00:40:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:40:30
RAY - uhm, and I also asked her to use my pronouns - 

00:40:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:40:30
Pronoun = They 

00:40:30
RAY - that was they, uhm, and she's been resisting for the last year. 

00:40:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:40:40
RAY And I've, I started just asking, uhm, I don't know I offended them that way and then over the course of a few months, I became a little bit more insistent about it. 

00:40:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:40:50
RAY Uhm, and I think that eventually she sort of started to understand that our relationship was being seriously compromised by the fact that she wouldn't, ah, used my name and pronouns but also that she wouldn't really engage with me at all asking me questions or talking to me - 

00:41:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:41:10
RAY - about my gender. She wasn't making an effort to understand - 

00:41:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:41:15
RAY - at all. 

00:41:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:41:15
RAY Uhm, so about a month before thanksgiving, we hadn't, we hadn't seen each other for a few months because I was sort of planning to cut her out of my life. 

00:41:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:41:30
RAY Uhm, she started talking to me a little bit about it. I think she realized what's going on and how high stakes it was. Uhm, so she told me that she was going to tell the family - 

00:41:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:41:45
RAY - uhm, ah, that I prefer Ray and that, and she used they around me, uhm, and also she told me that she had been looking at some resources on-line, trying to understand what queer and gender queer identities are. 

00:42:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:42:00
RAY Uhm... 

00:42:00
KEVIN NADAL And what was it like when she told you that she was doing that? 

00:42:05
RAY I don't really believe her at first. Uhm, I didn't understand where that change - 

00:42:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:42:10
RAY - would have come from. Why she be motivated, uhm, especially because in the past she had told me things like of, like the world and our family shouldn't have to, ah, conform - 

00:42:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:42:25
RAY - to your subculture and the way that you think about that. Uhm, I didn't believe her because I think there is almost no reason for her to be doing that at that point. Uhm, and, you know, she seemed she didn't have any ideological alignment - 

00:42:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:42:45
RAY - with queerness. Uhm, in fact, she had, she asked me in the past why would you do this? She cames from a tradition of second way of feminism in which she doesn't understand why somebody that is born female, that was born a girl would, would give that up, would-- to betray the womanize movement. Uhm - 

00:43:10
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:43:10
RAY - she sees us as betrayal, uhm, politically and ideologically towards her. Uhm... 

00:43:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:43:15
RAY So... 

00:43:15
KEVIN NADAL So at first you didn't believe her and then how do you feel about it now? 

00:43:20
RAY Uhm, I'm starting to believe that she is attempting to make an understanding happen. Uhm, she-- I thought at first, I noticed that she would use my pronouns and chosen name directly with me but when she talk about me in other people but that just didn't happen. I don't know if I was a function of embarrassment but I assume so, uhm, aware... 

00:43:50
KEVIN NADAL How did she react when you notice her doing that? 

00:43:50
RAY She would feel really judged and she would say, "You're not giving me enough of a chance." Uhm, I think I did give her a chance for months - 

00:44:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:05
RAY - and at that point, I just wasn't ready to make myself vulnerable in that way. 

00:44:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:44:10
RAY Uhm, but so thanksgiving was sort of a, a turning point in some way. Uhm, it certainly didn't make everything better but I wasn't aware of my, my whole family was finally aware of identity - 

00:44:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:44:25
RAY - uhm, and for the most part, they try not to talk to me or about me. 

00:44:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:44:30
RAY Uhm, I think that they are nervous about that. Some of them just buoyantly ignored it and other ones. Uhm, and nobody ask me questions or it would just something that would have made feel better. 

00:44:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, so how that that feel when nobody was asking or anything or talking with you about it or talking with you at all? 

00:44:55
RAY Uhm, I think I, I got their general sense that I was being ignored that is made sort of invisible - 

00:45:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:45:00
RAY - in that space. I think it's easier for my family to not acknowledge it and go along with it. 

00:45:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah, so then what happened at, uhm, after that when you started to notice that you're being ignored? 

00:45:15
RAY I, I closed off a little bit. I sort of disassociated from the situation. 

00:45:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Uh-hmm, did your mom notice that you dissociated? 

00:45:30
RAY No, no, I mean I think that's generally what I do in family situations or what I have been doing - 

00:45:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:45:35
RAY - for years. There's sort of this anticipated misunderstanding - 

00:45:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:45:40
RAY - on my part, uhm, and I think that until my family, ah, makes it a goal to reach out to me, uhm, to demonstrate that they're attempting to understand, I'll feel a lot more safe in those basis. 

00:45:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure, I mean that sounds awful that you, you're family isn't supportive of you and, you know, you could feel isolated within your own family. What's it like talking about it right now with me? 

00:46:05
RAY Uhm, it feels empowering to talk to somebody who understands - 

00:46:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:46:10
RAY - uhm, who asked me questions about it. Uhm, gender is such a complicated thing so of course and, you know, you can never really talk to somebody and have them completely understand what you're feeling is. 

00:46:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:46:25
RAY It just so personal but knowing that somebody is interested in understanding the intricacies of my own personal gender that feels really good to me. 

00:46:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. I mean one thing that, you know, I had notice as you mention this invisibility and, and sometimes, you know, not saying anything and that the absence of, of sharing anything can be just as hurtful as somebody is saying something overtly, you know, negative or a transphobic or, you know, genderist or whatever it might be, you know. So, you know, I think that's really important to realize is that, you know, your feelings are valid. 

00:47:05
RAY I'm-- I mean I would honestly, rather my family say transphobic things to my face - 

00:47:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:47:10
RAY - uhm, I don't like the of secrecy and hiding - 

00:47:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:47:15
RAY - in that way and it also gives-- would give me a chance to explain myself and maybe enlighten them in some way a little bit. 

00:47:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, so have you talk to your mom since the thanksgiving? 

00:47:30
RAY Ah, yes. 

00:47:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm, and what is she-- what did you said to her and what does she have to say? 

00:47:40
RAY At this point, I'm not really interested in talking to her about it. I think that it's going to have to be the type of family situation where we pretend that it's not happening. 

00:47:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:47:50
RAY Unfortunately, I don't have the financial or emotional stability to really sever ties. 

00:47:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:48:00
RAY Uhm, and I think it just need to be a game of concealment. 

00:48:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, how does it feel that it has to be that way? 

00:48:05
RAY Uhm, frustrating. 

00:48:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:48:10
RAY But I guess better than the alternative I, I need a mother. I can't really cut her out of my life and I appreciate that she's trying in some way. 

00:48:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I mean that just sounds that you said frustrating, hurtful, other feelings that had may come up for you? 

00:48:30
RAY Uhm, it feel sort of dirty to me to engage and those situation of pretending. 

00:48:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:48:40
RAY Uhm. 

00:48:45
KEVIN NADAL Tell me more about that, that dirtiness. 

00:48:50
RAY I just, I don't like feeling like I have to hide it. 

00:48:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:48:55
RAY Uhm, I'm not sure whether would need to not feel dirty in those situations. Uhm, I feel like I'm being manipulated in a sense and, and, and that dirtiness just felt-- it comes from, this feel like never sort of cheating each other. 

00:49:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I noticed that your body language, it look like you cringe a little bit or like you know had a reaction as you were saying this. What's going on for you right now? She talked about that dirtiness. 

00:49:30
RAY Uhm... 

00:49:35
[sil.] 

00:49:40
RAY I don't know. I feel uncomfortable. I mean talking about these things in general, ah, I internalized them in this way that I mean it, it feels physical having a gender queer identity. There is always some part of every uncomfortable interaction that I centralized in my body. Uhm - 

00:50:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:50:05
RAY - so I think that that, you know, my discomfort as always of, in some way about my body, uhm, and I internalized and externalized my feelings - 

00:50:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:50:15
RAY - as a result of that. 

00:50:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Do you recognize when you internalize this feelings? 

00:50:25
RAY Uhm, not actively. 

00:50:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:50:25
RAY I see them doing it when it's pointed out. 

00:50:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah, and then what tends to happen when, ah, when it's not pointed out? 

00:50:35
RAY Uhm, eventually, I have to realize that I'm feeling this way and, and it usually doesn't come up in a good away. 

00:50:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Does it affect to other relationships with people or are just aspect of your life when you do internalized some of these feelings? 

00:50:55
RAY Yeah, I mean I, I think that the frustration and sadness, and mostly, anger that I feel as a result of this rejection, it gives me less tolerance of other things that bother me. 

00:51:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:51:15
RAY Uhm, yeah, I, I see it come out in unexpected ways. It's distracting. 

00:51:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean it just sounds like so much to have to deal with. You know, like you already have these other stressors to, to-- that you, that, that we all deal with. But you have this extra burden to deal with. 

00:51:35
RAY They feels that way at times. 

00:51:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Uh-hmm. How about other relationships in, in your life? Do you notice, uhm, that, you know, people may treat you in certain ways that, that caused you to internalize negative feelings about yourself? 

00:51:55
RAY Uhm, I, I think in general I'm, I'm treated differently than other people that I see - 

00:52:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:52:00
RAY - uhm, which is the results, I-- of a bunch of different things. You know, I, I sort of live an alternative lifestyle which I think is very intertwined with my gender - 

00:52:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:52:15
RAY - because I choose to put myself in social circles where people feels similarly and they're accepting, uhm, and when I leave those circles I'm, I'm always-- I forgot what the real world is like. 

00:52:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:52:35
RAY So and it, it feels it's shocking at, at times - 

00:52:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:52:40
RAY - uhm, just-- cuz I, I and looked at-- I mean I'm-- like daddy there in this way that's still organizing or, or again I'm sort of overlooked. 

00:52:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Do you think of any experiences that demonstrate that? 

00:52:55
RAY Uhm, I, I face it regularly, ah, in school. 

00:53:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:53:00
RAY I'm a graduate student and I, and I feel a little bit like the black sheep - 

00:53:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:53:10
RAY - of my program. Uhm, I may the genders unacknowledged and constantly, in those situations, uhm, really I'm read as queer. I'm read as, ah, lesbian. 

00:53:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:53:25
RAY Uhm, and I don't feel safe in correcting people - 

00:53:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:53:30
RAY - so... 

00:53:35
KEVIN NADAL So what happens on those instances where people assumed something about you and then you don't feel safe and correcting them. How do you usually act on those, ah, situations? 

00:53:45
RAY I mean, it feels it's, I, I don't feel like it's me. You know, I, I hear people using she for me and it, and it, it's confusing to me and I usually think at first like they're talking about somebody else. 

00:54:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:54:00
RAY Uhm, ah, I eventually, just have to sort of think of it as this part or role I play. 

00:54:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:54:10
RAY Uhm, and I, and I have very separate lives. I have the school life and I have my personal life and I don't participate in school in the way that I would otherwise where I to feel like I can't come out there and feel safe. 

00:54:25
KEVIN NADAL Yup. So in some ways it feels like you, you have different worlds in, in one world who kind of accepted that these are some of the things that people are gonna say and ways people are gonna treat, then you do have your safe space in where you can feel free to be who you are and people to understand you and accept you and that sort of thing. 

00:54:45
RAY Uh-hmm. 

00:54:45
KEVIN NADAL What's it like having to have these two worlds? 

00:54:45
RAY Uhm, it's confusing. It makes me not wanna spend time at school. It's-- I'm a student of psychology and it's really made me feel, uhm, uncomfortable and dissatisfied with the field of psychology. In general, I do work in social and cultural psychology and it's ironic to me that I'm studying these type of things and the affects that they have on people. And I, I feel them on, ah, minute by minute basis but I, I can't claim that as my own experience - 

00:55:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:55:25
RAY - and it causes me to feel not only resentful on those basis but of the work that I put my time and energy into. 

00:55:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. That's sounds rough. It sounds like really having to have to think about this all the time. 

00:55:45
RAY Yeah, I think it's all the same. 

00:55:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and again I just wanna check in what's it like talking with me about this right now. 

00:55:50
RAY Uhm, it feels okay. It feels, ah, I, I mean I don't mind-- I like talking about my gender and my experiences with people that I can trust and that I feel safe with. 

00:56:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:56:10
RAY That's a rare experience. 

00:56:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and it sounds like, you know, you do have those basis and some circles of, of support that you can go to. Uhm, but it also sounds like there a lot of places where you don't feel that way. 

00:56:25
RAY Uh-huh. 

00:56:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and that must feel really isolating as well. 

00:56:30
RAY It's different talking to somebody outside of these circles. I, I sort of assume that once I leave the safe space of my friends, I have this inherent feeling of I have to put on the shield, I have to, uhm, expect to be misunderstood, and it's a unique and at times confusing experience to walk into another space, uhm, and open up in that way. 

00:57:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, but it also sound like it's a very real kind of thought and expectation to have, you know, that people may not understand or be open, or might be very transphobic. So, you know, it's sounds that's part of the conflict that, that it's, you know, you don't want necessarily to feel this way and to, to feel as if, you know, people are gonna judge you but the reality is that a lot of people may. 

00:57:30
RAY Uh-hmm. 

00:57:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. So, you know, I think it's, you know, really important for me just to stress that. I think it's great that you have this. I mean you're, you're here and like you'd have-- you're able to express, uhm, how you're feeling and some of the things that, that you're going through. I think it's really easy to internalized like what you had mentioned a lot of these negative emotions. And I guess I just wanted to check in with, uhm, which is your coping. And how do you feel you cope, uhm, when all of these things are happening and like you said it's very heavy, it's exhausting? How do you cope with these things? 

00:58:05
RAY Uhm, honestly, I don't do a good job of coping or I don't use, uhm, coping mechanism that are necessarily good for my sustained well-being. Uhm, I intend to you try and forget it in ways whether that's like there are substances at times or putting myself in situations, uhm, you know, that are, that are removed from my daily life and situate that I can't, I make, I make those feelings inaccessible. 

00:58:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:58:50
RAY Uhm... 

00:58:55
KEVIN NADAL So, it's easy to try to escape and not deal with some of those negative feelings? 

00:59:00
RAY Yeah. 

00:59:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:59:00
RAY I mean I realized that there are other things like can be doing but honestly it's feels I'm just continually exhausted. 

00:59:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:59:10
RAY I feel and, and I, I do try and cope in some ways. I mean I, I have established really great circles of social support. 

00:59:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

00:59:25
RAY Uhm, so, you know, that's important and that's made me feel better but when you're continuously faced with a lot of different angles of like confusion and discrimination coming at you, or misunderstanding, you have to kinda watch on to whichever - 

00:59:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:59:50
RAY - way is most accessible - 

00:59:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:59:50
RAY - to cope and sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. 

00:59:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. When you, you have these, ah, the support networks, uhm, how often do you tell them about things that are happening particularly like these discriminatory experiences? 

01:00:10
RAY Uhm, very regularly but a lot of it is so regular in my life that it's not something that I'll bring up. 

01:00:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:00:20
RAY Uhm, if I have like a very specific in sense of transphobia or homophobia that comes at me then I can relay that and something that's, that I get a lot of support from. But in a circle of people that have similar experiences talking about the glances that you get everyday or the, you know, or the offending comments that people make it. It's, ah - 

01:00:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:00:50
RAY - it's, ah, there's a mutual understanding that of course, we're all feeling those things. 

01:00:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah, so it's good to, to have those support like now, I wonder if, you know, if, if sometimes you may feel hesitant and, and, and really processing, how you really feel or, or in depth, uhm, because they, you know, it can be easy just to dismissed them. It's having happen all the time or, you know, and I wonder what happens when those feelings don't go fully processed. 

01:01:15
RAY Uh-hmm. 

01:01:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:01:20
RAY I mean I, I don't know. I think that again it's hard to draw the line between what is worth processing - 

01:01:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:01:35
RAY - and what is something that I - 

01:01:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:01:35
RAY - can put aside. 

01:01:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. It kinda reminds me of your relationships with your mom. It just sounds like, you know, to some degree, you know, you just kind of want to avoid that conflict in that relationship and, you know, I wonder if, if, ah, you know, how you feel about that if you, if you feel like that's the, the best thing for you to do right now and, and if there would be, ah, if, if you wanna would see anything different or try anything different, uhm, in that relationship. 

01:02:10
RAY Uhm, I think a lot about, a lot about being trans and gender queer is speaking your battles. 

01:02:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:02:20
RAY And I think unfortunately, there's this idea that eventually people can understand and people can, uhm, come around but, ah, in my experience that's not necessary a reality for everyone. Uhm, and there are these many ideas which I wish I had just never came out to my mother. 

01:02:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:02:45
RAY Uhm, cuz if I'm gonna pretend with her then it's easier to not even have burst that topic to begin with. 

01:02:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:02:55
RAY Uhm, but as I see things going forward, I need to see more of an effort from her before I feel like I can - 

01:03:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:03:05
RAY - change the way that I interact with her. 

01:03:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yup, and I, I don't think that you need to do anything immediately. I think it's fine to just be where you're at and for you to, you know, to, to be okay with that. I mean it's sounds like maybe in the future that you might wanna see some improvement to your relationship but, but you know, maybe we can, you know, just kind of a think about ways that you can also just, ah, be okay with, with, you know, meeting her where she's at and, and maybe you might need to take a little pray(ph) from her. Yeah. So you know, it just sounds like you're, you're-- there's so many things and going on, uhm, in your life and, you know, again I just wanted to reiterate. I think it's really great that you come here to, to talk with me, you know. 

01:04:00
RAY Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad I have the opportunity to do that. 

01:04:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and you know, and I know that we have been seeing each other for a little a bit now, uhm, after several months now and I think that, uhm, I've seen a real growth in your ability to really open up in process and, you know, this awareness that you have of yourself. And I like this idea that you said about picking your battles cuz, cuz it seems like sometimes you need to make decisions of how to approach things and you seemed to have a good awareness of that. 

01:04:30
RAY I try. 

01:04:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, okay. So why don't we ends now. And we'll pick up next week. 

01:04:40
RAY Okay. 

01:04:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:04:40
RAY It sounds good. Thanks. 

01:04:40
KEVIN NADAL Thanks a lot. 

01:04:40
Debriefing with Ray 

01:04:45
KEVIN NADAL So Ray, what was it like talking with me today? 

01:04:50
RAY Uhm, I felt reasonably comfortable. Uhm, I think that in general, I'm (inaudible ). It feels pretty comfortable talking about these things. Uhm, I think I, I have developed the discourse around, uhm, this but it's really important to be talking to people that also share that discourse in some way - 

01:05:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:05:20
RAY - or have a familiarity with that. 

01:05:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:05:25
RAY Uhm... 

01:05:25
KEVIN NADAL How do you think this conversation will be different years before you started to have this discourse or you started to, you know just think about or, or even meet other people who had similar identities or experience such as you. 

01:05:40
RAY Uhm, I think it would look a lot at different in terms of me being both(ph) of vocalized my needs. 

01:05:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:05:45
RAY Uhm, and I would have a lot more trouble situating my experiences and, ah, narrative that was - 

01:05:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:05:55
RAY - consistent and personal. 

01:06:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. What do you think you would need from a therapist that you are, uhm, in that stage of your life? 

01:06:05
RAY Uhm, it's hard because I, I really-- I very much appreciate having a therapist that understands language that I have. But I simultaneously would not gonna thought things, - 

01:06:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:06:20
RAY - uhm, by a therapist so I, I wanna kind of come to these understandings of the way that I talk about my experiences organically - 

01:06:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:06:30
RAY - and, and of course, a lot of that is influenced again by the, by the circles that I'm in but, uhm, it's important to me that I'm-- that there's understanding with what I'm saying I-- that I feel hurt. 

01:06:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:06:50
RAY Uhm, and also that I'm, that I'm not, ah, a kind of led in the, in the direction that would, that would make me feel, you know, like I'm being educated. 

01:07:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. What other qualities in the therapist do you prefer or do you enjoy or what other approaches that they might use that have been helpful for you in the past? 

01:07:15
RAY I like having a therapist that identifies as queer themselves. 

01:07:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:07:20
RAY Uhm, not necessarily because I need to talk about that with them but it makes me feel more safe to-- for somebody again to have a familiarity with what I'm feeling. Uhm, I sort to have the expectation that of course their experiences won't be projected upon mine. But in general, I feel, eyes that don't see around people that aren't queer. 

01:07:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:07:45
RAY Uhm, it takes me a longer time to build trust. 

01:07:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:07:50
RAY Uhm, and that trust can't be earned. In the past, they had therapist that have-- for me, earned to my trust is by the fact that they didn't have an identity in common with me. 

01:08:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:08:00
RAY Uhm, but there's sort of a barrier that has to be broken first. 

01:08:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Can you think of what maybe a non-queer, Cis or a person could do to gain that trust with you? 

01:08:15
RAY Uhm, yeah. I think that, I think that there, I think that there's, I think-- I guess I would like to be asked questions, uhm, if there's no understanding. I'm not going to assume that somebody understands - 

01:08:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:08:35
RAY - what I'm saying unless they demonstrate that they're interested in that. I can teach any language that I'm using. 

01:08:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:08:40
RAY Uhm, I understands that somebody that I'm talking to, that's queer might have similar experiences and I, I need to hear that. Somebody that doesn't have those experiences, uhm, wants to best understand those, not only in a sense that we're processing my emotions - 

01:09:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:09:05
RAY - uhm, and what I felt that also, uhm, just in this way that they want to learn themselves from - 

01:09:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:09:15
RAY - that. 

01:09:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, it's great. So thank you so much for being part of this. 

01:09:20
RAY Thank you. 

01:09:20
Client 3: Morena 

01:09:25
KEVIN NADAL Our third client is Morena, a transgender woman who's originally from the Philippines and has lived in the US for the past nine years. Morena comes in with two presenting problems, her career and her romantic relationships. One of the issues that surfaces in the segment is the issue of passing. 

01:09:40
Passing = the idea that transgender people can be perceived as cisgender 

01:09:40
KEVIN NADAL Sometimes when transgender people undergo medical treatment, they may pass and that people may not know that they are transgender. However, even when transgender people do pass, they still deal with the spectrum of issues particularly with discrimination. Finally, as Morena tells us her story, I choose to utilize a feminist approach as a way of empowering her and focusing on her strengths. 

01:10:05
KEVIN NADAL So hi, Morena. Thanks for coming in today. 

01:10:10
MORENA Thank you, Kevin, for having me. 

01:10:10
KEVIN NADAL So tell me a little bit about what you wanna talk about. 

01:10:10
MORENA Well, I would like to talk about my, hmm, career. 

01:10:15
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:10:15
MORENA And also my, ah, love life. 

01:10:20
KEVIN NADAL Okay, good. 

01:10:20
MORENA And some of my experiences. But first of all, I wanna talk about, how I transform? 

01:10:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:10:25
MORENA I transform four years ago. 

01:10:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:10:25
MORENA Okay. I came here in America nine years ago. 

01:10:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:10:30
MORENA My family accepted me for who I am - 

01:10:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:10:35
MORENA - but they did not validate me. 

01:10:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:10:35
MORENA They still call me from my, you know - 

01:10:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:10:40
MORENA - my - 

01:10:40
KEVIN NADAL The name of birth, yeah. 

01:10:40
MORENA - previous name. Yes. Name of birth, yes. But because my mom always telling me that I was baptized at that name and I will die on that name - 

01:10:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:10:50
MORENA - because heaven knows - 

01:10:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:10:55
MORENA - them, oh, what I mean my, my name was written in heaven - 

01:10:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:11:00
MORENA - in my birth's name. 

01:11:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:00
MORENA But I always telling to my mom that I think mom that doctor made, ah, a mistake when he wrote my gender to my - 

01:11:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:11:10
MORENA - birth certificate. I always joke in to my mom - 

01:11:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:10
MORENA - but until now, they still calling me in my birth's name. 

01:11:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:11:15
MORENA But it was okay for me. It, it doesn't have an effect on me as long as my mom telling me that you excel. Just don't do any-- I mean just do the right thing. 

01:11:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, in your days, ah, in the Philippines? 

01:11:25
MORENA No, they're here. 

01:11:30
KEVIN NADAL They're here. 

01:11:30
MORENA They're here. 

01:11:30
KEVIN NADAL Okay, so you're family is Filipino and they're religious. How do you think that affects, ah, their acceptance of you? 

01:11:35
MORENA Well, being Filipino and being, being Catholic. 

01:11:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:40
MORENA Be-- born and raised Catholic 100% - 

01:11:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:40
MORENA - there's-- they're still conservative. 

01:11:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:45
MORENA They're still living in an old school. 

01:11:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:45
MORENA And, uhm, I cannot blame them for that. 

01:11:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:11:50
MORENA And I'm not asking them to accept me for 100%. 

01:11:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:11:50
MORENA As long as they let me live and, ah, you know, live the lifestyle that I want. 

01:12:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:12:00
MORENA That's it and they, ah, okay with that. 

01:12:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:12:05
MORENA But the only thing, sometimes is when we are all out together. They still call me in my birth's name. 

01:12:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:12:10
MORENA Sometimes I ignored them and then I joke, ah, I joke to them that who are you calling? 

01:12:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:12:15
MORENA And, you know... 

01:12:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and how they respond when you say that? 

01:12:20
MORENA They don't respond back. 

01:12:20
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:12:20
MORENA They just keep on calling me in my birth's name. 

01:12:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:12:25
MORENA But it, it doesn't have an effect on me. 

01:12:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:12:25
MORENA Because when I transform like this, I put in my mind like I, I programmed on my, on my, on my, on my mind that there will be circumstances along the way. 

01:12:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:12:40
MORENA And this is one of these. 

01:12:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:12:40
MORENA But, ah, most-- I mean in my job - 

01:12:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:12:45
MORENA - in my job, I used to work in the big companies. I don't wanna mention them. 

01:12:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:12:50
MORENA Uhm, human resources knows my true gender. 

01:12:55
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:12:55
MORENA But, uhm, those people that I work with - 

01:13:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:13:00
MORENA - especially big companies, they don't know what I am. 

01:13:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:13:00
MORENA But there are some people who are walking sometimes on my cubicle - 

01:13:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:13:05
MORENA - and always asking me, "Oh, you're Morena." I said, "Yeah, why?" "No, just curious." There are people walking by in my cubicle just asking, "Oh, you're Morena." And I'm also curious why they always asking me. 

01:13:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. So what do you make of that? 

01:13:25
MORENA I-- it doesn't-- no, again, it doesn't affect me. 

01:13:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:13:30
MORENA But, ah, sometimes it gives me validations or sometimes it gives me a negative impact of what people thinking about me behind my back. 

01:13:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm, sure. 

01:13:40
MORENA And while I'm using the bathroom, I don't have a problem. 

01:13:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:13:45
MORENA There's good thing about me is most people or most of my friends telling is I'm passable. 

01:13:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:13:50
MORENA I can pass. 

01:13:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:13:50
MORENA But the thing is when they see my document - 

01:13:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:13:55
MORENA - the only thing that has a problem is the gender issue - 

01:14:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:00
MORENA - instead of M, it's F. 

01:14:00
KEVIN NADAL I see. Yeah. 

01:14:00
MORENA It's the only thing that I have a problem with. For example today, I do have an interview. 

01:14:05
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:05
MORENA I went for an in-- job interview today, I had a panel interview. 

01:14:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:14:10
MORENA Everything will, will went okay and then they asked me train for tomorrow - 

01:14:15
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:15
MORENA - supposedly, I have a training tomorrow and I have to fill up the background check, - 

01:14:20
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:20
MORENA - everything. I slightly check the M box for the gender. 

01:14:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. Okay. 

01:14:30
MORENA Everything was okay only that particular box. 

01:14:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:14:30
MORENA And the human resources asked me, oh, you forgot to check or you mistakenly check the M mark. 

01:14:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. Yeah. 

01:14:40
MORENA You should check the F. 

01:14:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:14:40
MORENA I told her like I was born male. 

01:14:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:45
MORENA "Okay, no problem," she said - 

01:14:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:14:50
MORENA - and she walk back and I heard from outside the boardroom - 

01:14:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:14:55
MORENA - they have a deliberations. 

01:14:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:14:55
MORENA I cannot, ah, understand them well - 

01:15:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:15:00
MORENA - but I can hear them, they're having a deliberations about me. 

01:15:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:15:05
MORENA Well, somebody came back to me and said, "Oh, the personnel will talk to you about the background check because she wants to talk you-- talk to you personally for the back-- ah, for the some questions for the back ground check." 

01:15:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:15:20
MORENA And, ah, she's not available today and you're not gonna have a training tomorrow - 

01:15:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:15:25
MORENA - but probably, probably, next week - 

01:15:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:15:25
MORENA - we will call you. I don't know yet when she gonna be available but definitely or probably we'll call you." 

01:15:30
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:15:35
MORENA So that was end but - 

01:15:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:15:35
MORENA - it took all my information, everything. 

01:15:35
KEVIN NADAL Right, so how does you feel about that? 

01:15:40
MORENA Well, I'm very skeptical. I don't know yet. 

01:15:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:15:40
MORENA I don't know yet. 

01:15:45
KEVIN NADAL It's all up in the air. 

01:15:45
MORENA Yes. 

01:15:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:15:45
MORENA The reason why I, I mean going back to where I was worked in a different companies before, big companies before and they'll come, I mean there's I saw the good, ah, opportunities come-- came to me - 

01:16:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:16:00
MORENA - that I said to myself like I'd rather put up my own business rather than work in the big companies like this - 

01:16:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:16:05
MORENA - because politics are - 

01:16:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:16:10
MORENA - really in here. So I was, ah, working and living in somewhere in downtown Wall Street - 

01:16:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:16:15
MORENA - and I have this building, ah, living one, one loft - 

01:16:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:16:20
MORENA - with my roommate - 

01:16:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:16:25
MORENA - and then the third floor became vacant and we made it a bedroom breakfast. 

01:16:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:16:25
MORENA So we put it up three bedrooms and then another four bedrooms on the fourth floor. 

01:16:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:16:35
MORENA So basically I do have seven rooms available as a bedroom breakfast and then I manage that for four years - 

01:16:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:16:40
MORENA - and I resigned from my previous jobs and it went well - 

01:16:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:16:40
MORENA - for four years and all of the sudden the building was sold. 

01:16:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:16:45
MORENA That gla-- just this year and after that, now I'm working for-- ah, looking for a job. 

01:16:55
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:16:55
MORENA I'm a jobless now. 

01:16:55
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:16:55
MORENA It takes time for me to adjust - 

01:16:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:00
MORENA - working again - 

01:17:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:00
MORENA - from being an entrepreneur. 

01:17:00
KEVIN NADAL From having your own business. Yeah. 

01:17:00
MORENA Yeah. 

01:17:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:05
MORENA So that's where am I right now. 

01:17:05
KEVIN NADAL So how does it feel to, you know, not only you have to find this new job, to have a-- something like this happened where there's some issue about your gender and maybe now you're a little bit more skeptical about - 

01:17:15
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:17:15
KEVIN NADAL - whether or not you're gonna get this job. How does that feel? 

01:17:20
MORENA Well, it feels frustrating. 

01:17:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:20
MORENA If I do only have the money I will like to go back as a entrepreneur - 

01:17:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:25
MORENA - because I always experienced most of my friend. 

01:17:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:30
MORENA I feel bad for them sometimes because they don't have the opportunities like I do have. 

01:17:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:35
MORENA They sometimes end up to be prostitute. 

01:17:40
KEVIN NADAL You had the transgender friends? 

01:17:40
MORENA Exactly. 

01:17:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:40
MORENA I do have a lot, yeah. 

01:17:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:45
MORENA They ended up to be prostitute because they always telling me that they couldn't find a job - 

01:17:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:17:50
MORENA - number one. Number two is there are-- some of them are undocumented. 

01:17:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:17:55
MORENA Number three they feel, ah, being discriminated. 

01:18:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:00
MORENA And most men who are after them - 

01:18:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:05
MORENA - are only looking for something for, you know - 

01:18:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:18:10
MORENA - part of their fantasies. 

01:18:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:18:10
MORENA So their taking advantage of, "You like me - 

01:18:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:15
MORENA - so you have to pay for me." 

01:18:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:15
MORENA And then they get used to it and now they became - 

01:18:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:20
MORENA - their source of income. 

01:18:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah, it sets something that, ah, not that prostitution profit of the man at the dating even though you mentioned you wanna talk about dating. 

01:18:30
MORENA Yes. 

01:18:30
KEVIN NADAL It that something that's common and, ah, then who might want you as a fantasy. 

01:18:35
MORENA That's another thing though because I usually doesn't hang out in the gay bar - 

01:18:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:18:40
MORENA - because, you know, I feel like I don't belong there. 

01:18:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:18:40
MORENA Okay, gay guys doesn't like me - 

01:18:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:18:45
MORENA - because, you know, anyway I usually hang out in the street bars. 

01:18:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:18:50
MORENA Most men who comes to me, approach me, gave me drink like this, like that. 

01:18:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:18:50
MORENA When they became intimate to me, I try to push them and tell them like you have something to know - 

01:19:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:19:00
MORENA - and what is that? I'm not that kind of girl. 

01:19:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:19:00
MORENA So from that point I gave them already, ah, ah... 

01:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Like a hint. 

01:19:05
MORENA A hint. 

01:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:19:10
MORENA Others still don't get it yet. 

01:19:10
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:19:10
MORENA Okay, they're still pushing through of - 

01:19:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:19:15
MORENA - you know, getting forward and I'm always telling them wait - 

01:19:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:19:15
MORENA - I have to tell you something more. 

01:19:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:19:20
MORENA Like what? I wasn't born-- I'm not 100% genetic girl. 

01:19:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:19:30
MORENA Sometimes they always step back - 

01:19:30
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:19:30
MORENA - but surprisingly out-- they're out of 10 guys, eight will say, "Oh, my god. It's okay. I wanna see you again." 

01:19:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:19:40
MORENA I wanna go out with you and two will say it's not for me. 

01:19:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:19:45
MORENA Well, it's not for everyone actually. 

01:19:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:19:45
MORENA But generally, those eight guys that will say, okay, who will go back to you, they will use you, at the end of the day they will go back to their girlfriends - 

01:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:20:00
MORENA - and their wives. 

01:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:20:00
MORENA Again, they're mean. 

01:20:00
KEVIN NADAL So how does that feel when that happens? 

01:20:05
MORENA I feel used - 

01:20:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:05
MORENA - and I feel I'm just part of their fantasy. 

01:20:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:10
MORENA And they're always telling me you're different - 

01:20:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:15
MORENA - because I understand their-- the anatomy of men, the body of men - 

01:20:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:20
MORENA - basically, yeah. And by that, but I mean after that they still have to go back like what I've said to girlfriend and wife because - 

01:20:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:30
MORENA - at the end of the day, they still wanna have a family. 

01:20:35
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:20:35
MORENA I think it's so hard for me to find a rela-- I never had any relationship ever since I got here. 

01:20:40
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:20:45
MORENA But I think gay guys like - 

01:20:45
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:20:45
MORENA - gay boys, they have possibility of having a relationship rather than us. 

01:20:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:20:50
MORENA That's one of my struggle. 

01:20:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:55
MORENA And I really wanted to have a relationship - 

01:20:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:20:55
MORENA - rather than going to the-- going or meeting people - 

01:21:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:00
MORENA - from time to time. 

01:21:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:21:05
MORENA I don't have problem meeting people anywhere in the streets, anywhere in the trains, I always chased by meanie guys. They're giving me number. Sometimes they asked for my number but again... 

01:21:20
KEVIN NADAL The relationship, this is what you want. 

01:21:20
MORENA Yes. 

01:21:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:20
MORENA It's so hard, I don't know why. 

01:21:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah, so what's it like talking about this right now? 

01:21:30
MORENA Well, I'd like to shared this because I'd like to find them an, an answer. 

01:21:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:35
MORENA That sometimes when I share this to, to fellow transgender, - 

01:21:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:40
MORENA - they're also seeking an answer. 

01:21:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:40
MORENA Maybe somebody there, who knows, - 

01:21:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:21:45
MORENA - who knows the right answer. 

01:21:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:21:45
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:21:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean I think that, ah, this experience is something that, you know, happens a lot of the times that were a lot of trans, transgender women or again, you know, used for fantasies or, you know, viewed as exotic and, and then once they get what they want to them and then they leave them. But, you know, at the same time like, you know, to know that, ah, you know, I think that relationship is very possible. 

01:22:15
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:22:15
KEVIN NADAL It's just a matter of finding the right one and, you know, maybe-- well, there might be a lot of obstacles, uhm, that, you know, I, I do think it's possible. You know, I've seen a lot-- several transgender women who, who enter relationships and I think, you know, that's something that's, that is possible. 

01:22:30
MORENA Yeah. 

01:22:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. What is it like for me to, to say that or for you to hear that from me? Someone who's not a transgender woman particularly. 

01:22:40
MORENA Kinda encouraging. 

01:22:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:22:40
MORENA It doesn't mean it feels like I don't have to lose hope. 

01:22:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:22:50
MORENA But I'm keep on looking. 

01:22:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:22:50
MORENA Yeah. 

01:22:50
KEVIN NADAL And that's the thing I wanna stress is that - 

01:22:55
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:22:55
KEVIN NADAL - you know, well, I want to, uhm, perhaps instill that hope in you to also validate you - 

01:23:00
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:23:00
KEVIN NADAL - that it's, it's a very common experience for transgender woman to be mistreated like that. 

01:23:05
MORENA There are some bars in here in New York - 

01:23:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:23:10
MORENA - that, ah, has a transgender parties. 

01:23:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:10
MORENA Like meet and greet. 

01:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:23:15
MORENA I meet some guys who are really into a transgender. 

01:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:20
MORENA But there are some guys who were really, the first time, I mean for example, a transgender party, the guy will approach me hi, hello. 

01:23:25
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:23:25
MORENA What's your name? Are you working? - 

01:23:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:23:30
MORENA Are you a working girl or not? I said, no. I'm not working girl. 

01:23:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:35
MORENA I'm just here for fun. 

01:23:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:35
MORENA Well, that's stigma alone. 

01:23:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:35
MORENA It triggers me. Ah, I put that on my mind that I really have to prove something. 

01:23:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:45
MORENA I also put that in my mind that I wanna be an advocate of transgender that we're not only good, ah, about-- I mean we have, we have talents. 

01:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:23:55
MORENA That we have these things in us - 

01:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:00
MORENA - that it's so hard for us sometimes to bring it out - 

01:24:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:00
MORENA - to excel because of that gender issue. 

01:24:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:24:05
MORENA There are some people are pushing us down, stepping us down. But if you let them, people stepping you down - 

01:24:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:15
MORENA - nothing will happen to you. 

01:24:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:15
MORENA Yeah. After I lost my business I, I had these depressions. 

01:24:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:24:25
MORENA Because it's so hard for me to adjust from being entrepreneur - 

01:24:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:25
MORENA - to under the employee. 

01:24:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:30
MORENA And it's so hard for me to tell them that I used to be like this - 

01:24:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:24:35
MORENA - and now I'm working with you. 

01:24:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:24:35
MORENA And it's another thing, it's so hard for me to disclose about my gender issue. 

01:24:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure, so there's a lot of these obstacles. One is that you - 

01:24:45
MORENA Yeah. 

01:24:45
KEVIN NADAL - you had a very successful business - 

01:24:50
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:24:50
KEVIN NADAL - and now, you're trying to reenter the, the, the work force. You know, having-- already have this business and work on your own and then you have to deal with this idea of having to disclose your new gender. 

01:25:00
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:25:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:25:05
MORENA Yeah, and one issue also that I also, ah, ah, learned for straight men, for example in a profession of work, when it helps someone that I'm transgender sometimes I became part of their fantasy. 

01:25:20
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:25:20
MORENA They ask me a lot of questions about sexual, - 

01:25:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:25:25
MORENA - my sexual preferences. 

01:25:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:25:30
MORENA It is better sometimes for me not to tell - 

01:25:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:25:35
MORENA - because the more I tell them, the more they ask questions. 

01:25:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:25:35
MORENA When they ask questions-- the more they ask questions, the more they're getting curious. 

01:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:25:40
MORENA When they're getting curious about you, the more they, they wanna use you. 

01:25:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:25:45
MORENA So that's one of my issue sometimes. 

01:25:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah. 

01:25:50
MORENA That's why sometimes, the more I, the more I keep my mouth shut the better for me. 

01:25:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure, and so that's, ah, something you've learned - 

01:26:00
MORENA Yeah. 

01:26:00
KEVIN NADAL - because in disclosing yourself you have to deal with a lot of questions. 

01:26:05
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:26:05
KEVIN NADAL A lot of times those questions can be very, ah, invasive or invading and - 

01:26:10
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:26:10
KEVIN NADAL - inappropriate. You know, like they a lot-- that people wouldn't really ask other people questions about, ah, their sexual preferences or behaviors but for a lot of times you feel they can do that to transgender people. 

01:26:20
MORENA Yeah. 

01:26:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah, a lot of those who didn't feel that. It's okay to ask transgender people about their body parts and, you know, just things that are very private. 

01:26:35
MORENA Yeah. 

01:26:35
KEVIN NADAL Uhm, for instance... 

01:26:35
MORENA I have that a lot. 

01:26:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, for instance they wouldn't do that necessarily with, ah, a somebody who is not transgender. 

01:26:45
MORENA Especially men. 

01:26:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. So how do you, how do you deal with all these? How do you cope with all these things in your life? 

01:26:50
MORENA Well, I just smile at them. 

01:26:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:26:55
MORENA And I tell them like it's not your business. 

01:26:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:26:55
MORENA Well, if who-- if you wanna know more, I can introduce you to some, some of my friends. 

01:27:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm, yeah. Yeah, you mention that issue of passing earlier. You know, in a lot of times when people think about, ah, transgender people who are passing, they think that it's so much easier like oh, they're, they're passing and, you know, they, they, ah, don't have any problems anymore because they're passing. 

01:27:20
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:27:20
KEVIN NADAL But I think what's important here is to realize that even though you, you do pass that you still have to deal with a lot of stuff - 

01:27:30
MORENA Yeah. 

01:27:30
KEVIN NADAL - you know, a lot of obstacles that you encounter. 

01:27:30
MORENA When I say you, ah, you pass, you pass a certain way but when it comes to documentations - 

01:27:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:27:40
MORENA - scrutiny. 

01:27:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:27:40
MORENA That's one thing that you cannot escape off. 

01:27:45
KEVIN NADAL Right. You mention earlier you, you lightly check the M box. 

01:27:45
MORENA Yeah. 

01:27:45
KEVIN NADAL It's so as that because legally it used you, legally - 

01:27:50
MORENA Yes. 

01:27:50
KEVIN NADAL - still are identified as male. 

01:27:50
MORENA Yeah, legally I change my name - 

01:27:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:27:55
MORENA - when I came here, ah, two years ago - 

01:27:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:27:55
MORENA - because when I used to travel abroad like I wanna go to Europe - 

01:28:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:00
MORENA - when I used to have my birth's name - 

01:28:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:05
MORENA - the, the immigration from other country still, you know, double check my, my, my identity - 

01:28:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:10
MORENA - when-- but when I check my first name, I mean when I legally change my first name - 

01:28:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:15
MORENA - I, I can easily pass on. 

01:28:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:20
MORENA I can easily, you know - 

01:28:20
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:20
MORENA - pass but, ah, my, my lawyer, when I change my first name, he asked me why do-- why don't wanna change your gender it's that you are allowed that legally. 

01:28:35
KEVIN NADAL Yup. 

01:28:35
MORENA But I told him, when I travel abroad again - 

01:28:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:35
MORENA - if I change my gender - 

01:28:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:40
MORENA - I mean if they scan me that I still have - 

01:28:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:28:45
MORENA - and, you know - 

01:28:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:45
MORENA - the male's gender or the genital - 

01:28:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:45
MORENA - it's another question. 

01:28:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:28:50
MORENA So that's why I told him like to retain that since - 

01:28:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:28:55
MORENA - I don't have the - 

01:28:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:28:55
MORENA - ah, I don't have intentions of changing it. 

01:29:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:29:00
MORENA I am contented for what I am - 

01:29:00
KEVIN NADAL Yup. 

01:29:00
MORENA - and that's they call me special because of this. 

01:29:05
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm, yeah. 

01:29:05
MORENA And yeah. 

01:29:05
KEVIN NADAL I mean it's amazing that you have to think about all these things - 

01:29:10
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:29:10
KEVIN NADAL - and a lot of non-transgender people do not have to think about this at all. You know - 

01:29:15
MORENA Yeah. 

01:29:15
KEVIN NADAL - they could fill out their passport application and not have to even think twice about checking a box versus, you know - 

01:29:20
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:29:20
KEVIN NADAL - checking a box on your passport or in, in a job application. 

01:29:25
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:29:25
KEVIN NADAL You know, these are the things that, that you know, aren't affect you. 

01:29:30
MORENA You know, sometimes people when, ah, I mean I don't deny - 

01:29:30
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:29:30
MORENA - being-- if somebody ask me, I don't deny if they ask me if I am-- was born-- if I, I was born male or female. 

01:29:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:29:40
MORENA I don't deny it. Ah, I will tell and I would like to discuss that to anyone - 

01:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:29:45
MORENA - who are curious. 

01:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:29:45
MORENA But talking about my sexual preferences - 

01:29:50
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:29:50
MORENA - I, I feel uncomfortable with that. 

01:29:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:29:50
MORENA Yeah. 

01:29:50
KEVIN NADAL And, and you have a free right to not talk about your sexual - 

01:29:55
MORENA Exactly. 

01:29:55
KEVIN NADAL - preferences with others. 

01:29:55
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:29:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, and again just to reiterate. I think a lot of times, transgender people are, are asked a lot of questions that are very private and intrusive that, uhm, that non-trans people aren't asked. Yeah, so I think you have it right to, to... 

01:30:10
MORENA Refuse it. 

01:30:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, to refuse to ask-- to answers those questions. Yeah, I mean it seems like, you know, you sounds that you, you, you, ah, are able to cope with some of these things. It seems like you try to not let things bother and try to, to stay positive. But I also wanna revisit, you know, the times when you said you became depressed after you, ah, you're, you're-- you'd lost your business or your business, uhm, and it end, you know, I wonder, ah, you know, how we can ensure to prevent that from happening. You know, were you may get depressed again to-- what, ah, what are some of the things that led you to, to feel depressed? 

01:30:45
MORENA Well, after I lost my, my business, I don't know how I have to come back from the bus-- I mean from the professional world - 

01:30:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:30:55
MORENA - because I used to work with myself - 

01:30:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:31:00
MORENA - and now I have to work again to someone else - 

01:31:00
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:31:00
MORENA - that I used to be the boss. 

01:31:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:31:00
MORENA And I have to go back again as an employee. 

01:31:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Well, one thing that, you know, we talked about, uhm, a little bit earlier which is this idea of a lot stigma or stereotypes about transgender women being sex workers, uhm, or you know, just fulfilling men's fantasies and you talk earlier about wanting to be an advocate, uhm, to show that you do have talent and you can be successful on it. And I think that's one thing I've noticing from you is that it sounds like you, uhm, have had that success in your career and then, you know, your business. Uhm, what does it, what does it mean for you, ah, to be successful and to break some of those stereotypes and, uhm, to, to not, ah, fulfill that, that's stereotype that, that people may be have of you. 

01:31:50
MORENA Well, I'd like to prove or I would like to, to tell them that we are not only good in that certain area like - 

01:31:55
KEVIN NADAL Uh-hmm. 

01:31:55
MORENA - being a prostitute because they look at, uhm, was like the example that I gave you. Some of them are undocumented - 

01:32:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:32:05
MORENA - yeah, they don't, ah, being discriminated, discriminated because some of them doesn't pass. 

01:32:10
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:32:10
MORENA They're-- and some of them are, they lose hope because some of the men hurt, ah, what they call it, ah, ah, - 

01:32:20
KEVIN NADAL That they're using them. 

01:32:25
MORENA - using them as a part of their fantasies. 

01:32:25
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

01:32:25
MORENA Well, I'd like to prove to them that we have this-- we have the talent. 

01:32:30
KEVIN NADAL Yup. 

01:32:30
MORENA We're not only having a talent but we have the brain. 

01:32:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:32:35
MORENA I know some of the people or some of the, the Filipino or transgender that I know are college graduate back home. 

01:32:40
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:32:45
MORENA And they have this, ah, bachelor degree with them. 

01:32:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:32:50
MORENA The only thing about them is they are being blinded by the money that they're earning from being a prostitute. 

01:32:55
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:32:55
MORENA And I'd like to tell them like what if you use those talents that you have had when you were in the Philippines rather than being like this because they're gonna be forever beautiful. 

01:33:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

01:33:05
MORENA And You're not gonna be forever like being used by different men all the time. 

01:33:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah. 

01:33:10
MORENA Your money is there, really money is there. I'm almost tempted to do that. I'm almost tempted. 

01:33:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:33:15
MORENA They're earning so much money like I don't wanna mention how much. 

01:33:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah. 

01:33:20
MORENA But, ah, yeah, they don't have the chance - 

01:33:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:33:25
MORENA - like I've had. 

01:33:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:33:25
MORENA And I want to be the one, the first to tell them that come on, let's go. 

01:33:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:33:30
MORENA But now I'm starting to pick up the pieces, I'm becoming-- I want them to be my, ah, ah, ah, what you call this, uhm, example. 

01:33:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, like you wanna be a role model, an example for them. 

01:33:50
MORENA A role model, yeah. Uh-hmm. 

01:33:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:33:50
MORENA That somebody has to stand up. 

01:33:55
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you know, from just meeting you today, I'm, I'm already starting to see how much you are a role model, an example, you know, and that you seem to be, you know very, ah, aware of yourself and you seem to be really strong and able to handle a lot of the, the obstacles and the discrimination, uhm, that you've experienced in the past. You know, it sounds like at times that, you know, you're still human - 

01:34:20
MORENA Uh-hmm. 

01:34:20
KEVIN NADAL - and so, you know, you might become depressed or it might be difficult to handle some of the things, uhm, once in a while, uhm, but it sounds like you know, in, in general that you're, you're able to, to cope the best that you can with everything. 

01:34:35
MORENA Yeah. 

01:34:35
KEVIN NADAL What is it like for, ah, for me to say that? How was it like to hear that? 

01:34:40
MORENA Well, it boost my morale and it feels good. 

01:34:45
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

01:34:45
MORENA And I hope I can share this, uhm, to some of the people that, you know - 

01:34:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

01:34:50
MORENA - some people around me. 

01:34:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean that's unfortunate because like you had mention a lot of transgender women particularly, the transgender people, uhm, in general have a lot of obstacles they have to face and, and unfortunately, that might lead to, to things like prostitution. Uhm, but I'm glad that you've been able to, to avoid that and - 

01:35:10
MORENA Yeah. 

01:35:10
KEVIN NADAL - you know, to, to be, you know, the success that you are and then to, to use your talents like you said and be a good role model.
