PRIMARY focus CASUALITIES OF DIVORCE Produced by Pam Zelek 

00:00:25
GREG DICKSON I am home. Hi, tiny girl. Hi, you just had great day? 

00:00:30
PAM ZELEK It's a typical day in the Dickson household. 

00:00:35
GREG DICKSON Hey, can do me a favor? Can you… Can you make sure what is… 

00:00:40
PAM ZELEK Full of the usual things families do together. 

00:00:45
Bless us food. Dear Lord I pray make us thankful everyday in Jesus name, Amen. 

00:00:55
PAM ZELEK But for Greg Dickson, in a small way, it's a miracle. 

00:01:00
GREG DICKSON There was no way I was going to get married. 

00:01:00
LISA DICKSON He was running so hard and so fast away from relationships. 

00:01:05
GREG DICKSON I was always afraid well what happens, what happens if I get on the road and get a divorce? What happens if we have a kid? I don't wanna have a divorce. I never want anyone to live through what I live through. 

00:01:20
PAM ZELEK Primary Focus Greg Dickson was nine when his parents divorced and moved to different states. He wasn't alone. Since the early 70s when no-fault divorce swept the country, over 30 million children have seen their parents divorce. Psychologist, researcher and author Judith Wallerstein began studying these children in 1971. 

00:01:35
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN Sr. Lecturer Emerita, Univ. of CA, Berkeley We started to get a lot of problems. And from parents, a lot of questions from teachers, especially nursery school teachers saying these children were out of control. And the prevailing myth at that time and this persist to this day is that divorce is not very serious for child. I mean if it's good for mama, it's good for Marie Jane. And not to worry about it. But these people were calling for help. And I was supposed to know the answers. I went to the library and I discovered that there was not a single study of divorce and its effect on children. And we had passed laws all over the United States and not considered the impact on children. 

00:02:25
PAM ZELEK It was this lack of research that prompted the Berkeley faculty member to begin her 25-year landmark study. Her results published in the Unexpected Legacy of Divorce has sparked controversy for their claims that divorce is a long-term crisis from which children don't easily recover. 

00:02:40
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN Divorce is a major turning point in the life of the parent and in the life of a child. For the parent, the divorce is the remedy. They've had to end a happy chapter. They gotto bring it to a close. They're gonna start fresh. For the child, it isn't a new chapters that's their family. 

00:03:00
GREG DICKSON I grew up in this own house. And I would come home and I was the last kid of the bus and so I come home and I always remember my mum being downstairs in the basement doing laundry. 

00:03:10
PAM ZELEK In a different family miles from where Greg grew up, Katie Torkelson played happily in her home. 

00:03:15
KATIE TORKELSON When I was child the life ah… I couldn't ask for anything better. I really had… I had everything that I ever wanted, you know desired that kind of thing. I had… I did have two very devoted parents that did their best for us. 

00:03:30
GREG DICKSON I remember certain songs being played on the radio, certain smells from the laundry and then my mum down there. But there was a warm blanket on a cold winter night feeling about having mum home all the time. It was awesome. 

00:03:45
KATIE TORKELSON When I got to be about eight or nine, things did seem to dwindle in my parents relationship. It seemed that you could probably cut the tension with a knife. With my parents I've noticed they started fighting a lot more. And one vivid memory that I do have of my parents fighting is, one night when my dad was home early enough to put me to bed and he was talking me into bed and then my mum came storming from somewhere and said; "I'll put her to bed forever you will… you will not anymore, you will never do it." And while I was lying in my bed, they were fighting over me literally standing over me fighting. I just remember gripping the blanket going, who are these people? What is going on? I don't have any idea who these people are that, you know that are saying these things to each other. 

00:04:35
PAM ZELEK And younger the child, the greater the devastation. 

00:04:40
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN The most vulnerable age for divorce is young children, children up to age seven, because they need the home. They need two parents. A 5-year-old has hardly anyway they can comfort themselves. And the loss of the family structure at that point really cuts into their development. 

00:05:05
PAM ZELEK Berekely student Victoria Chen was in the category of vulnerable children. 

00:05:10
VICTORIA CHEN When I was four my parents separated. My mother took my sister and I into apartment while my father remained in the house. And I never truly understood what was going on. I remember I used to always ask my mum why we couldn't live with my father? Why he would never really stay with us after I was four? And her explanation was always that my parents didn't get it wrong that they had some differences, they couldn't sort it out. It sounded almost like she was taking as if this was temporary. For me I thought that this is only going before year, there is something wrong with the house, my relationship like with my parents or my parent relationship. And I just took it all in strange, because I thought that eventually we would just move back into the house with my father and everything would be fine. 

00:06:00
PAM ZELEK But everything wasn't fine. Two years after her parents separated, Victoria got news she never expected and what should have been one of her happiest days. 

00:06:10
VICTORIA CHEN My sixth birthday was probably one of the most devastating events of my life. I remember just having this party. I invited all my friends from my school. My whole family was there and I… But it was really a special day to see them altogether again. And they could come together for me and it was really I guess a nice feeling. But then I remember my father just sitting me down and he was telling me how there is going to be changes. I did really understand what divorce was but I knew that my parents were no longer together and that was out of mind. I remember just being completely devastated just in shock. 

00:06:55
PAM ZELEK Gabe Casciato does not remember ever living with his father. His parents divorced before his second birthday. He lived with his mother who remarried and had a daughter. Years later his stepfather, the man he called dad for 12 years left his mother. Their last argument involved Gabe. 

00:07:15
GABE CASCIATO The night he left, we were walking out to go to karate and he told my mum that he wanted her to drop me off and come back. She said she wanted to stop and watch me. And he said, I don't want you there, I want you to come home. And he said, I'm going to watch my son do karate. And he said, if you are not back in half hour I'll be gone when you get back. She said good bye. And when we got back he was gone. I think I thought I was the problem. You know the problem was that they couldn't talk or that they were both selfish or whatever, I mean whatever was going on. But you don't know that at 13. At 13 you see if you go to karate, when you… when you come back I'll be gone, you come back he is gone and well what's the problem. The problem was that you went to karate that night. I mean, your dad just left and it's your fault. I mean, it's not your fault, but… but it's your fault. You go hallow. You go cold. 

00:08:00
PAM ZELEK The emotional roller coaster these children are riding rolls faster and faster as they deal with many changes and looses. When adult separate income often drops for one or both parents and that can mean the loss of a childhood home and the change of the neighborhood school and friends. And if a mother has been staying home full or part-time to raise her children, they also lose much of her focus and attention when she returns to full-time work. Perhaps even worse is the loss of the trust and security that an intact family provides. 

00:08:35
GABE CASCIATO I mean, here is the person you swear till death to your part for better for worse and… and you can leave him, what promises hold? What person is trustworthy? What people are gonna to stay? 

00:08:45
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN Children are very… very frightened by divorce. They realize at very early age that if one parent can leave another what is to keep both parents from leaving me. 

00:09:00
PAM ZELEK Children lose trust and gain new roles and responsibilities, often times becoming a caretaker for a hurting or needy parent. 

00:09:10
GABE CASCIATO I can't remember a time when I didn't feel like a substitute husband for her. 

00:09:10
KATIE TORKELSON I felt that I needed to be the strong one, I needed to be the adult. And I wanted to be… I wanted to be there for her for every moment that she needed me. 

00:09:20
GABE CASCIATO I really had to step up and be even more of an adult than I had to before trying to support her through a divorce, trying to help her make decisions, trying to keep the house running. 

00:09:30
KATIE TORKELSON When she needed a shoulder to cry on I was always there. I made sure that I was always there. I didn't make a lot of plans with friends or they can think I always felt that my mum needed me and so I needed to be home for my mum. 

00:09:45
PAM ZELEK There are other painful loses as well. 

00:09:50
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN They lose the sense of safety that they have when you got two parents who can help each other and you need that lots of times when a child is growing up. 

00:09:55
GREG DICKSON I don't have that security. I don't have that… that groundedness that I had before. 

00:10:00
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN They lose the access to one parent. 

00:10:05
KATIE TORKELSON They had worked out a visitation in terms of I would see him one day a week and then on the weekends too. 

00:10:10
GREG DICKSON As we would see my dad may be around Christmas and then definitely a week during the summer time. 

00:10:20
GABE CASCIATO When I was growing up I saw my dad intermittently, it really depended. Right after the divorce I didn't see him for a while and then we started seeing him once or twice a year. 

00:10:25
VICTORIA CHEN I talk to my father a lot on the phone that one year, but after that it actually started dying off and now I only receive a call from him once a month and most probably. 

00:10:35
GREG DICKSON When my father was there we come around and it would be a strange thing, because I am supposed to be sending my dad (inaudible ). I mean, to this day I really sent him (inaudible ), because he is not… he is my dad, but he is not my dad. 

00:10:50
PAM ZELEK Custody issues are also a great concern for Wallerstein, who believes that courts do a poor job of looking out for the best interests of the child. 

00:11:00
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN I mean, there is the father who has rights, there is the mother that has rights and the child is a ragdoll. They don't take to consideration the children are growing and are changing. And court orders are always related to the present. And what might be a very appropriate court order for a three-year-old is very unlikely to be appropriate for an eight-year-old or for a 11-year-old. 

00:11:25
PAM ZELEK Wallerstein's study found that for children of divorce there was less supervision, more drug and alcohol use and more anger. 

00:11:30
GABE CASCIATO I can't remember a time when I didn't feel angry, when I didn't feel like I was constantly on the verge of exploding. 

00:11:35
VICTORIA CHEN My relationship with my mum after my dad left was very bitter. And there is a lot of animosity between us. She blamed me for being too much like him. 

00:11:50
GREG DICKSON I feel very angry with my father. I didn't know who to blame. I wanted to blame him because he wasn't there. I didn't know who to blame. But I was very angry that they couldn't get it together, together. 

00:12:05
GABE CASCIATO I punched a locker every single day of my senior year at least once. Once I got so mad I just lowered my head and ran head first into it. Wheeled on a telephone pole so bad. Once my hand was so swollen I couldn't put it my pocket to hide it from my mum. 

00:12:20
GREG DICKSON I stopped taking his calls and I never… I stopped going to see him. So I didn't see him for five years. 

00:12:25
GABE CASCIATO Anger is very much still an issue. It's probably the biggest thing I still… still struggle with. 

00:12:30
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN The prevailing myth today which parents are told when they go to see an attorney or even a mental health person is that if you don't fight, if you settle things with civility, if you have a fair financial settlement and if the child has access to both parents then there will be no problem at all. The child will be distressed for a short period of time. After that the child will recover and continue her developmental progress as if nothing had happened, and because children after all are resilient, so not to worry, that's the myth. And it's told and it's believed. 

00:13:10
PAM ZELEK Wallerstein found that as traumatic as divorce is for kids at the time of the breakup, the main effects emerge when those children become young adults and want to establish relationships of love and intimacy, it's then that they are haunted by the ghost of their parents divorce. Some are fearful of commitment others afraid to trust. 

00:13:30
KATIE TORKELSON They grabbed on to the issue of trust in terms of not being able to trust a male figure, because my dad was the male figure in my life and he loved us with my marriage to Tim, I didn't know if I really wanted to trust, because I didn't want to be disappointed. 

00:13:50
TIM TORKELSON I kind of took marriage more for granted that this is the way it was and we are married and… and we were going to stay married. And I don't think Katie always felt in that way that it was you know a sure thing. 

00:14:05
KATIE TORKELSON Whenever he would come home later than what I… he had said or what I thought he should, it was always, what are you doing? Who were you with? I mean, it was all-out brawl, because I felt I… my worse nightmare had come true. 

00:14:20
TIM TORKELSON It was just more frustrating than anything because my lack of understanding where she was coming from and just never entered my mind that she maybe… would have been so panicked or… or upset. I guess I never even thought that the fact that she didn't trust me. 

00:14:40
KATIE TORKELSON It was tough to let Tim prove that he is not my dad and that I could trust him. I mean, now that Tim and I have been married for almost nine years, there still is that little bit of a trust issue that we have deal with in terms of my apprehension. 

00:14:55
PAM ZELEK Like Katie, trust proved difficult for Gabe when he married Wendy. 

00:15:00
GABE CASCIATO My dad left. They got divorced and he split. What makes me think my wife is gotto stay? You know she loves by choice. I'm his kid he has to love me. If he can be driven away who can't be? My wife has done nothing that would cause me to distrust her at all. And I don't distrust her and yet at the same time I'm constantly having to ask her bunch of useless probably hurtful questions about who she… you know where she has been and who's she with and did anybody hit on her last night or whatever that she probably thinks is obscene or (inaudible ), Gabe that's just stupid. And I know… you know it's stupid, but the fear you… you have to ask. 

00:15:35
PAM ZELEK What Greg Dickson feared was commitment. He and Lisa dated on and off throughout college and then lived together for several years after graduation. 

00:15:45
LISA DICKSON I knew I wanted to marry Greg. And we had talked about it for long time but he… he kept saying, but I won't get married until I'm sure. 

00:15:50
GREG DICKSON I was looking for that, because I didn't want to do the divorce thing. I didn't want to split up the kids thing. I didn't want to do that to anybody else. 

00:16:00
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN What they say is very clear. They say look, if you don't marry you don't divorce, and I don't want to divorce. 

00:16:05
LISA DICKSON I proposed actually and he turned me down. 

00:16:10
GREG DICKSON I was basically trying to say no, I'm not going to be married, if I don't worry about the marriage thing then I don't have to worry about the divorce thing, because the divorce thing is the ugly thing. 

00:16:15
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN They have to understand and learn from their own experiences what goes into a couple. What they're really looking for? What love is about? What fidelity is about? And that takes them longer. 

00:16:30
GREG DICKSON The fear of loosing her, the fear of screwing up my life as well as my feelings towards of loving her and wanting to be with her. What's all that mean? 

00:16:45
PAM ZELEK For Greg after seven years of dating Lisa it meant turning his back on the demons of his parents divorce and taking a step forward into his future. But that future is still held fears especially when it came to parenthood. 

00:17:00
GREG DICKSON We're married, just Lisa and I and we don't have kids. If something were to happen, we don't have kids. It's still kind of that safety thing too. I have no idea. I don't have it all figured out. I've got so many issues, problems whatever, who might to say what makes a great father and husband whatever and I'm so (inaudible ) and I have a child and then try and raise that child. That scared me. 

00:17:25
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN Many adults who've been raised in divorced family decide not to have children. And they say so, look at my childhood, how I be a parent? 

00:17:35
LISA DICKSON Again that was one of those things, Greg wanted to make sure he didn't bring the kids into the world, you know unless he was certain. 

00:17:45
PAM ZELEK Which brings us back to Greg Dickson's miracle of sorts. Because just as he overcame his fear of divorce and finally married Lisa, he took another risk and became a parent. Seven years after they married Katie was born. Samantha followed 22 months later. 

00:18:05
LISA DICKSON He was an amazing dad. He is really amazing. 

00:18:10
LISA I'll miss you Dabbie. 

00:18:15
GREG DICKSON It's a big hug too. 

00:18:15
LISA DICKSON I have just seen such an amazing transformation in him since Katie was born and then Sam, you know he has just got that love that he's just so happy to be able to give. 

00:18:25
GREG DICKSON What does it take to be a good dad is just being a… being good husband, is being a good dad. What I missed growing up was spending time with my dad. It's just being always there for them, someone they can always turn to. 

00:18:40
PAM ZELEK Divorce leaves scars in its victims that can take many forms. For Victoria Chen it's a more cynical view of marriage. 

00:18:45
VICTORIA CHEN I think that to see that one example of marriage, the common example of marriage that I've had in my life to see it end in such ruin has jaded my view of marriage and what my day in store for me. 

00:19:00
PAM ZELEK For Gabe it's a lingering struggle with anger and trust as well as concerns over parenthood. 

00:19:05
GABE CASCIATO You know I really like to have kids, but it terrifies me ah… Never having a dad, I don't how to be one. 

00:19:15
PAM ZELEK But there is redemption as well. 

00:19:20
JUDITH S. WALLERSTEIN The good news of my study is how much young adults change in that period of 20 to 32 to 33 and how much they are able to grow and change to the direction that they want to. 

00:19:35
WENDY CASCIATO I think we've helped each other. And our trust has grown through the past couple of years as he has seen that I'm worthy of trust and I have seen that you know he is worthy of trust. We've grown a lot in that way. 

00:19:50
GABE CASCIATO There is a lie in our society and a lie that I was told growing up that if the husband and the wife can't get along that sometimes it's better if they separate. That's a lie, it's not. It's better… It's better for everybody if they work it out, go get counseling, talk to people, work it out don't be so selfish. 

00:20:15
GREG DICKSON What could ever come up that is so big that I don't want to spend time with Lisa and my kids. There is nothing. Yeah, I get angry. People get angry all the time, but that doesn't mean you… you need to split that relationship in half and never go back to it. My dad will never be the dad he was before the divorce, after the divorce. And there was no dad that I've seen there is the dad, you know split away that's ever with the same dad that he was before. And we need more fathers to be there for their kids and we need more parents to be there for their family. And splitting up is not doing the right thing. It's going the wrong away.
