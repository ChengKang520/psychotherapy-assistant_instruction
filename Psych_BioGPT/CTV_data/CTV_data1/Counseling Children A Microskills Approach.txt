COUNSELING CHILDREN A MICROSKILLS APPROACH Mary Bradford Ivey 

00:00:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Counseling children is one of the most rewarding and exciting things one can do in the entire field of professional helping. You'll find the spontaneity and energy from children, which is nothing else but uplifting and joyful. Children respond well to early interventions, and one of the greatest satisfactions in my life is seeing children change rapidly in positive directions as a result of effective use of microskills. In addition to that, working with children is just plain fun. You'll get lots of laughs and warmth. The warmth you'll share with children is wonderful. You never know what a child is going to say. At the same time, it makes me very sad to think about the complex and deep issues that children face. Children have real concerns, such as difficulty with peers, trouble with academics, situational issues at home, or even harassment for reason of race, gender, or social class. This series of video demonstrations is to show some basics in counseling children. I am focusing the series on fairly typical issues that children bring to counseling. If you can work with these microskills, you have a good foundation for working later with the more difficult issues that you will face. Essentially, the same counseling procedures work with children as those that work with adults, but you need to be very concrete and specific in your language. You need to be able to work in brief solution-orientated framework and you yourself need to love and to enjoy children. In this demonstration series, I have found wonderful child actors who role-played typical issues that you might expect to find in child-oriented counseling. I'm very thankful to them for their participation in the series, all videos have been shown to parents and approved for viewing. So, let us start the series.

They are Teasing Me About My Shoes Mary Bradford Ivey Damaris Delgado 

00:02:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  This videotape demonstrates the micro-counseling five stages of the interview. The first two stages relationship and structuring and gathering data are combined in this tape as I already had a relationship with Damaris, and she knew what to expect from me. Particularly important in stage two is gathering data about the client's positive assets and strengths. Too much of counseling focuses on the negatives and the problems. Children, adolescents and adults will resolve their challenges best through attention to their strengths.

00:06:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Right, academics. The most important thing, oh my goodness, the most important thing in school is you learn to read and write and you do well in that.

00:06:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY They just spoil it. So you've got these good feelings inside, good that you're strong in academics, good that you're, you know, good at soccer and a leader.

MARY BRADFORD IVEY - we do about that? Is that sort of thing, (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
DAMARIS DELGADO Well.

00:09:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That kind of teasing? No, (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
DAMARIS DELGADO (inaudible ) 

00:09:07
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...it's really not, and it's not. It's really a name-calling. It's a teasing that really shouldn't occur. It's not part of our code, code of conduct. So, what do you think you could do? What. 

00:09:15
DAMARIS DELGADO Uhm, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You've come into me, but who else could you speak to?

MARY BRADFORD IVEY Talk to the homeroom teacher about- 

00:09:20
Paraphrase/Feedback 

00:09:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - this too because that sort of thing shouldn't occur. People shouldn't be teased for the way they, whatever clothes they wear. It doesn't matter, does it? 

00:09:30
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No. It's who we are in the inside and I'm a good person on the inside. So, we could talk with your teacher and it seems to me, you might need to do some talking to these kids that are doing the teasing... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  so that they know that that is not the way we... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...handle things here. You know? 

00:09:40
DAMARIS DELGADO  Uh hmm. 

00:09:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Any other thoughts on what we could do? 'Coz you're really in-charge here. You've got some lots of strengths, and those strengths are gonna take to this and- 

00:09:50
Feedback/Strength Bombardment 

00:09:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - to this problem and, and make sure that it doesn't continue to happen. 

00:09:55
DAMARIS DELGADO I could talk to them by myself and tell them how I feel and tell them that it doesn't really matter. 

00:10:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
DAMARIS DELGADO And maybe they'll stop teasing me but if, I don't know if that will happen. 

00:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. Well, you could try and if you need some more support, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...ah, if that doesn't work, then, we are certainly here to help you. The teachers are here and the, and the counselors are here because that really is an oppressive kind of comment to, to, to put somebody down for the shoes that they wear. 

00:10:20
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh-huh. 

00:10:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That's certainly not something that we can do here. And, and you have so many things to offer, the school and so many things to offer people that, that, uhm, that kind of thing doesn't need to be happening. 

00:10:30
DAMARIS DELGADO What does oppressive mean? 

00:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, Damaris- 

00:10:30
Information-Giving 

00:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - oppressive means, you know, this is, this certainly isn't your fault. This, the problem is really their problem. It's not your problem. It's, nothing wrong with your shoes, (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
DAMARIS DELGADO Oh. 

00:10:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...they're perfectly fine and, and if someone's being oppressed it means they put the problem in you and they're making you feel bad. 

00:10:45
DAMARIS DELGADO Uhm. 

00:10:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And they shouldn't make you feel bad for anything, you've got so many strengths and so many wonderful things happening, you know, they should not be doing anything like that. That's oppression if they're putting you down for the shoes you wear or for the way you look. I mean that would be, that's oppression and that should not happen. That's against our code of conduct and, and the kind of thing that shouldn't happen here at the school. 

00:11:05
DAMARIS DELGADO  Okay. 

00:11:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, we want to make sure that, that's stopped. And, and, uhm, I don't know. I think that, uhm, we should be talking to the girls. Uhm, I don't know if you should have to talk to them about that. 

00:11:20
DAMARIS DELGADO Yeah. 

00:11:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That's something that's really, uhm, you know, so inappropriate that I think that, uhm, the teachers and I... (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
DAMARIS DELGADO The teachers. 

00:11:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...should be talking to, uhm, the girls that are doing that and, (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  and hope that we can educate them to know how it's makes other people feel and to know that, that's not allowed... 

00:11:30
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  here at school. So, I'm glad you came to talk to me about that and, and I think it's important for you just to continue focusing on, on all the good things that you're doing... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DAMARIS DELGADO Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...in all your strengths.

Future Work On Teasing/Harassment Needs To Include Those Who Violate Standards of Conduct Counselors Can Help Students More Easily In Situations Where School Policies Support Student Rights Of Non-Discrimination. End of They Are Teasing Me About My Shoes The Positive Asset Search: Finding Strengths in the Relationship Mary Bradford Ivey Stuart Singer 

00:17:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Children often finds themselves in relational difficulties with friends and families. In this interview, Stuart is talking about the difficulties he's having with his older brother with whom he shares a room. The issue is sharing the same space and the arguments revolve around his brother teasing him and taking things. This video shows the positive asset search. Resolution of conflict can often be helped if we seek positives in occasionally troubled relationships. In this demonstration, I worked with Stuart to help him remember the things that he likes about his brother and the exceptions to the problems specifically what happens when things are going well? As you view this video, also take notice of how I worked with less verbal children. In this demonstration, you will notice that Stuart has very short answers to even the most broad issues. With concrete children such as this, you will find you'll have talk more but the listening skills remain important. It is particularly helpful to restate or paraphrase the exact words used by the child. This seems to facilitate their discussion and continuity in the interview.

00:21:25
STUART SINGER And we go rollerblading together. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And role, and rollerblading. Three different things and you do that pretty well without fighting... (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
STUART SINGER Yeah. 

00:21:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...get along pretty well. 

00:21:30
STUART SINGER Yeah. 

00:21:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Great! 

00:21:30
FOCUSING ON POSITIVE 

00:21:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So of all these good things that you do, in what percentage of the time are things are not going particularly well, would you say. I mean the times when you're in the bedroom and arguing about things. What percentage of the time... (crosstalk)

STUART SINGER Uhm. 

00:21:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...would you say, things are not going well? (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
STUART SINGER Not well. Probably only about, like, like 10 percent of the time. 

00:21:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Ten percent. So it's, you know, it's really, it's not serious but... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
STUART SINGER Yeah.

MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's kinda irritating just a little bit... 

00:21:55

00:22:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...between you and your brother. 

00:22:00

00:22:10
With Positives About Both, Mary Can Now Turn To Problem-Solving End Of Positive Asset Demonstration FIVE STAGE INTERVIEW YOUNG CHILDREN AND FRIENDSHIP ISSUES Mary Bradford Ivey David Marx 

00:22:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  David is a first grader and in this tape, you'll see how I worked with younger children. I still use the microskills of listening but you'll note that I must use an even more active listening style to get out his story. Children tend to give short and concrete answers to statements. It helps to have a lot of energy if you wanna keep the session moving. It almost helps if you're bit of a ham or an actor. Your percent of talk time goes up when you work with less verbal children but still be careful to focus on listening rather than on posing your agenda. In this tape, you'll again see the five-stage interview, but notice that with younger children, you can move through all the stages quite quickly. Keep most of your sessions with younger children short. They could return again later for another conversation. 

00:23:15
Stage 1: Rapport/Structuring Seek To Find Positives, Especially With Young Children It Helps Less Verbal Children If You Talk In A Friendly Fashion 

00:23:15

DAVID MARX Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, you get, I bet you're just getting better and better, I think, I remember you starting when you're just a really little boy. Isn't that right? 

00:23:35
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:23:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Now, you must be getting better and better. So how's school going this year? 

00:23:40
DAVID MARX Good. 

00:23:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good. What's the best thing about school for you? 

00:23:45
DAVID MARX Ah, I like lunch, snack, and recess. 

00:23:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Lunch, snack and recess, in that order, one, two, three. They're all great. Aren't they? But I bet you're a pretty good student too, aren't you? Yeah. Oh I'm sure you are. What do you like best about the school part? Even though you do like lunch, snack and recess best. 

00:24:05
DAVID MARX I like reading and writing. 

00:24:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Reading and writing, writing stories and things, uh-huh. 

00:24:10
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:24:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Well, that's great.

00:24:15

00:24:25
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:24:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Now, what, what's going on? 

00:24:25
Open Question 

00:24:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What's, what's the story there? 

00:24:30
DAVID MARX Ah well, they're both calling me up and ask if I wanted to play, but Jacob is not really Jeremy's friend. 

00:24:35
Paraphrase 

00:24:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Oh, so they both like you, but Jacob and Jeremy don't like each other. Oh boy, and how does that make you feel? 

00:24:45
DAVID MARX Sort of mixed up. 

00:24:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Sort of mixed up, kinda in the middle. 

00:24:50

00:24:55
DAVID MARX Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. So they're both friends but they don't like each other. Wow. So what happens when they call up? Say, Jeremy calls up- 

00:25:00
Paraphrase/Open Question 

00:25:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - and wants to play, then what happens? 

00:25:05
DAVID MARX Oh, then I go over but then Jacob calls. 

00:25:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then Jacob calls and he wants to play. Yeah. So you're feel- 

00:25:10
Summary 

00:25:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - like you're caught in the middle between these two kids that like you but don't necessarily like each other. 

00:25:20
Stage 3: Determining Outcomes: What Do You Want To Happen? With Youngsters, This Can Go Fast! Open Question 

00:25:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Uhm, that's a tough one. What would you like to have happen? 

00:25:30
DAVID MARX Well, if I get, if they just like each other. 

00:25:35
Summary 

00:25:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You would really like it and it would be great if that if, that if Jacob and Jeremy liked each other. Right, it would make it easy, easier for you, right? You wouldn't feel like you were mixed up, right? 

00:25:45
Stage 4: Exploring Alternatives Open Question 

00:25:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay, have you ever thought of what we could possibly do, to make that happen? Have you thought of what you could possibly do? 

00:25:55
DAVID MARX Not really. 

00:25:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Not really, you got any ideas at all? 

00:26:00
Note: Mary's use of David's Feeling Word "Mixed Up" 

00:26:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Let's think a little bit David about what we could possibly do about this, 'coz I'm sure it makes you really feel mixed up and a little bit torn apart between the two of 'em. What, what do you, what comes to mind and you really like to have them- 

00:26:10
Open Question: Mary Seeks To Have David Come Up With Ideas 

00:26:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - get along, I heard you say that. What comes to mind that something we could possibly do to solve this. Have you ever thought of anything? 

00:26:15
DAVID MARX You could like play with one friend with one day... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

00:26:20
DAVID MARX ...and you with the other friend with the other day. 

00:26:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay, so you could do-

Paraphrase/Open Question 

00:26:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - Jacob one day and Jeremy another day. 

00:26:25
DAVID MARX  Uh-huh. 

00:26:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Maybe even, what could you say to him? What would you say to him? 

00:26:30
DAVID MARX I could call him up and tell him, "I'll play with you one day and then I'll play with Jacob on the other day." 

00:26:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. And you could even tell him honestly- 

00:26:40
Advice/Suggestion 

00:26:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY "You know, just because you don't get along we can't seem to play with each other so I'll play with you Jeremy one day and Jacob another day." Yeah, you could do that. And then I thought of another, have you got any other ideas by the way? 

00:26:50
Stage 5: Generalization: It Often Helps To Bring Children Together In Friendship Groups Structuring/Directive 

00:26:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  That, that's a pretty good idea. The other thing I thought of is maybe we could bring Jacob and Jeremy down to my room here and just simply talk about it and see why is it that, here's two boys that really like you and that you can't both get along, 'coz that would make you a little bit happier if they could get along, so we could try that too, try a couple of thing. And you know what David? I think if we have the three of you in here, we could play some games together and just see how it goes and maybe we can work on things so that, uhm, you guys can learn to play together or they can learn to play together and you'll be part of that uhm, and things could be to, better for all three of you. Does that sound okay? 

00:27:35
DAVID MARX Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, let's give that a try. Thanks so much David, good to see you. 

00:27:40
End Of YOUNG CHILDREN AND FRIENDSHIP ISSUES COMMUNITY GENOGRAM Mary Bradford Ivey Damaris Delgado 

00:27:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  We know the genogram helps us see clients in social context, which really is their cultural background. You will find that it's a helpful strategy to learn about potential supports for the child. It also gives the child something to do with their hands while you talk about their life experience. Children seem to enjoy this strategy, they like talking about positives. Damaris was selected for this example because she's bright and highly verbal. Demonstrations such as this need a verbal child, so that the concepts can be presented in brief form. Developing a genogram with her takes about seven minutes, and other children may move more slowly, perhaps taking another session to finish such a community genogram. In this case, the emphasis is on family and on the church. Each child has developmental strengths from the community and you will find them in many different places. The community genogram helps us focus on both client uniqueness and their special cultural background. Some children may at first seem to have no family or community supports. My experience however is that after a careful search, we will find strengths in which we can later build counseling interventions. Regardless of issues, Damaris or any child, presents understanding cultural backgrounds and social supports network can be helpful in conceptualizing counseling and treatment planning.

MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...that's difficult, and sometimes there are difficulties and problems, (crosstalk)

MARY BRADFORD IVEY different things, that you have your family with you, you have... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
DAMARIS DELGADO Yeah. 

00:40:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...all this with you but, (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DAMARIS DELGADO Hmm. 

00:40:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...we focused primarily on the family and the church that they're with you and. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
DAMARIS DELGADO Hmm, helps me to appreciate the things that I have. 

00:40:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
DAMARIS DELGADO And that you know, how good I have my family with me and my church. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh-hmm. As you can see my focus on the community genogram emphasizes the positives and a search for support systems. Needless to say, not all children have as many support systems as Damaris has. But I can usually find substantial strengths and support for each child. Also we begin to realize each child is a person in community, we have seen very clearly how the self exists in relationship to others. 

00:41:20
End Community Genogram The Family Tree And Family Strengths Mary Bradford Ivey Jessica Burke 

00:41:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Children live in family context. Long ago, I discovered that individual counseling outside family understanding is most limited. If we are to understand children, it truly helps to understand their family situation. The family tree illustrated in this tape is a highly useful strategy to learn about the child in context. In this tape, you'll see how I focus on family positive stories as potential support for children's concerns and problems. Now, not all children come from supportive families, with such children I seek to find the family's strengths and good moments. And I encourage searching at the family tree and beyond for extended family, and even those outside the family who offered something positive for the child. The concept of family can be defined in many ways, and the informal structure of the family tree, or some related drawing will enable the generation of examples and stories of potential supports for the child. 

00:42:30
The Family Tree And Family Strengths 

00:42:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Jessie, I thought I, you know I brought this, ah, ah, pad here of ah, paper and some magic markers.

(crosstalk) 

00:42:55
JESSICA BURKE Okay.

End The Family Tree And Family Strengths Dreams Mary Bradford Ivey David Marx 

00:53:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  A young children have bad dreams and sometimes they reoccur again, and again. I happened upon a simple technique that is often very helpful. It tends to work best with primary age children , kindergarten, first, and sometimes, second graders, these children often use magical thinking and that's an important approach to dreams. In this demonstration, David has made up a dream but I think its the demonstration is fairly close to what actually might happen. As you hear this demonstration, know how important paraphrasing, restatement, and encouragers(ph) are. Many young children don't talk all that much, repeating what they say becomes all the more important for effective communication, also note with young children, you have to have lots of energy to keep things going, don't be afraid to talk.

Structuring, Open question 

00:55:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - and your mom called too and said that you have, had a bad dream that was kind of keeping you awake at nights and make you hard to concentrate in school, and I thought maybe that's you might wanted to share something that uhm, happened or, or some dream that you had that was bothering you a bit. 

00:55:30

00:56:15
Directive 

00:56:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - is sometimes we talk about our dreams and they way we get rid of our dreams, and I find a real helpful thing to do is to just simply take a piece of paper and, and maybe you can draw a picture. I've got those good smelly magic markers here, maybe you can just draw a picture of what it looks like that bed and how that little girl sinking down the bed, was it girl or boy? 

00:56:35
DAVID MARX A girl. 

00:56:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It was a girl, and she was sinking down in the bed and, you know, what it looks like to you in your mind, and then we'll have a special way to get rid of that dream, okay? 

00:56:40
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:56:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Let's see if you can draw a picture here, can you imagine what colors it might have been? 

00:56:45
DAVID MARX  What? 

00:56:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Of the dream, what, what the girl. (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:56:50

00:57:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  And she has yellow clothes on. Uh-huh, that's how you saw it, and then kinda, what did you imagine in your mind? 

00:57:50
DAVID MARX  What do you mean? 

00:57:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hmm? 

00:57:55
DAVID MARX What do you want mean? 

00:57:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, if you, you know so that she was in the bed then all of a sudden what happened? How could you draw that? 

00:58:00
DAVID MARX Like, she just like slipped there. 

00:58:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY She just fell down in the bed, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
DAVID MARX Yeah. 

00:58:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Anything else that you need to add to your drawing? 

00:58:10
"Anything Else" Important Question 

00:58:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Maybe actually make it a little bit, to show her slipping down, or is that. 

00:58:10
DAVID MARX  Uhm(ph). 

00:58:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Let's see. 

00:58:15
DAVID MARX I could make little cracks. 

00:58:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  Okay, good idea. 

00:58:20
[sil.] 

00:58:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  I mean where she fell? 

00:58:25
DAVID MARX I don't, I won, I wonder what the. 

00:58:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You wonder that too, where did she go, if the bed kinda came in like that, where did she go. I wonder if she sank right down on the bed, or maybe the floor, we don't even know, huh? Yeah. Okay, is that the way it looks like in your mind? 

00:58:40
DAVID MARX Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Great, okay this is- 

00:58:45
Directive 

00:58:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY - what we're gonna do. We're gonna take this, this is my magical way of getting rid of these bad dreams, these scary bad dreams, is to take up the scissors and just cut it up in little pieces. Just take, cut, cut, cut, cut. I only have a right handed scissor, do you think you're gonna be able to use that? 

00:58:55
DAVID MARX Yeah, I guess. 

00:58:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY  You guess, okay. We're gonna cut it right in half first so it won't be on your, you won't be thinking about it, and you won't be scared by it. And then cut it right through the center so you don't have to cut it out, you can cut through the center. You know what I mean? 

00:59:15
DAVID MARX Oh, yeah. 

00:59:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Well, actually we wanna get rid of it. So what, cut it up, you can cut it through the center so it's gonna go away, let's just cut it right up. Yup we're cutting it up. It's gonna be gone in just a little bit. In fact, you can even do some tearing, like you(ph), sometimes I have kids do tearing if it's hard to cut with those scissors. Cut it in little bitty pieces, maybe you wanna cut this one so it's not gonna... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
DAVID MARX Okay(ph). 

00:59:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY ...all right, great. Now, let's cut that up into bitty(ph) pieces, and that means its gonna go away. Can't you just see it's just gone. Now boy, you've got little bit, bitty pieces, that won't be bothering you anymore. Look at all those little pieces. Wow, you're a good cutter too, aren't you? 

01:00:00
DAVID MARX  So I cut this (inaudible ) (crosstalk). 

01:00:06
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, sure cut that up too. And then we're going to, there we go. Great. Good, very good David. Now, I've got a trash can right here below your legs, we're just gonna dump it right in the trash can, whish(ph) away goes that dream. You like that just like magic, huh? Now, what I'd like to do is maybe check with you uhm, in the next few days, next couple days and see if the dream just, is totally gone, I bet by the end of the week. I, I bet it won't even be there tomorrow. But you let me know, you, we'll get together. I'll stop and see you and we'll see is that dream back, and my guess is you're gonna say, nope it's gone, we, we cut it up and threw it away, yeah(ph). But I'll check to make sure, okay? 

01:00:50
DAVID MARX Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Thanks for coming in David. Nice to talk to you.
