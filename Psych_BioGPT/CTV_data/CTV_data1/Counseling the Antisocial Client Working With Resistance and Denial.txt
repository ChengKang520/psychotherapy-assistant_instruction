Norma Gluckstern Packard with Ralph Packard Introduction Allen Ivey Norma Gluckstern Packard 

00:00:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY  I'm Allen Ivey of Microtraining. And this is Doctor Norma Gluckstern. We have an important videotape we're about to present to you. One of the most difficult things that I've had as a counselor and therapist is working with the anti-social patient. Doctor Norma Gluckstern has been warden of a major prison in Maryland, and is really one of our national experts on dealing with the anti-social, our most difficult type of patients. So she is both the warden, and she is a counseling psychologist. So Norma, what do you have in store for us today. 

00:01:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, Allen, one of the things, as a result of what my work was, I became aware while I was initially trying to work with some of the patients, some of the clients are the inmates, was that a lot of what I had been taught got somewhat changed or converted, or had to be dealt with differently when I was dealing with these patients, with these inmates. And, ah, since microcounseling had been my, ah, focus, and I did my thesis at it, I began to look at what were the traditional skills that really were somewhat different, and some of them perhaps not as relevant in dealing with these patients. Ah, in particular, my feeling was that all of them suffered from anxiety, they suffered from depression. 

00:01:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:01:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN They suffered from all the standard things that may bring people to therapy. But the big difference was they were referred. They did not come to therapy because they thought they- (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY They don't have a lot of choice. 

00:02:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - they had any need. And that is what does impact on the way our skills are used, and how we can facilitate them. And so I hope that this tape will draw that out, and, and that sort of why, ah, I decided that, you and I decided it might be a good idea to try to do an anti-social tape, which really focuses on communication. It does not focus on necessarily any set therapy. It really focuses on how are the basic skills that we've all been taught. What happens to them when dealing with these patients. 

00:02:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY I know I talked to you a little bit about goals. What do you see the goal of the, basically the anti-social client inmate that's referred to you? Ah, what are their goals in coming in. 

00:02:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Interestingly, they base their goals, because I think that is the first phase. When a anti-social patient comes to you it's because they've been referred; they've been even referred by the courts, they've been referred because they've had family problems, or perhaps they've lost their job. So they have one goal in mind. And that goal is "How do I get their, something out of this counselor, that will either get back my relationship with my wife, will satisfy the courts." So they immediately are in conflict with you, because you as their counselor, are they're trying to get them to look at themselves. That's the last thing most of them want to do. So the goals become somewhat conflicted. And that is the- (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY My experience has been too that they want to get something out of me. 

00:03:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh. Abs. 

00:03:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Or rather wanna be helped. 

00:03:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And the other part is how can I manipulate or maneuver this person to get what I need. And so that usually is the first phase of interviewing with the anti-social client, is getting past that. 

00:03:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, we're about to see that first phase of the interview, ah, with the demonstration of the key issues and skills. 

00:03:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's right. 

00:03:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Ah, what are kinda your goals in that first phase of the interview? 

00:03:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think my goal on that first phase is to develop some kind of a relationship, something where there is some willingness to have interact with me at some level. I have no illusions that they're going out to try to manipulate me. I guess what I don't want them to do is necessarily see me as adult authority figure, and how do I avoid this authority figure. Ah, and, ah, that's a very mixed kind of thing because, ah, it's difficult. And it runs contradictory to much of what we've been, that we've been taught. 

00:04:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, it's a very different type of therapeutic alliance then. 

00:04:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's a very different. And it has to be, which is sort of interesting, a therapeutic alliance, but it is a different kind of alliance, and I think you put your finger right on that. And how we can accomplish that, what we, hopefully, just to see what the client that we're going to use. The other thing that I thought I might wanna bring out is that in this opening phase, the skills I primarily use will be the basic attending and questioning. 

00:04:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, because if I can't get through that first phase, I'm not gonna get into anything else. 

00:05:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Okay, one thing as we wind up, I think it's important, ah, what is the general theme of the case you're gonna have a demonstration role played on. 

00:05:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN In this case, we're gonna take a 35-year-old man, who's been divorced. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, he went to the local bar, and encountered the boyfriend of his ex-wife. Ah, they exchanged words. Ah, it leads into a fight, and in fact, once it actually involved a gun and arrest. And, ah, the, the, client has been sent to me, ah, by the courts to, ah, for a period of six to eight months, and to see whether we can have him look at this dysfunctional behavior and make some changes. 

00:05:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Good. One thing that is important, this is one example, but I think it's gonna be a representative of a lot of things where they work at the anti-social teenager, the same structure's going to happen. 

00:05:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, any kind of resistance. In truth, I mean, any resistant client. 

00:05:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Any resistant client. 

00:05:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, what are the, I think one of the real advantages of this videotape is even though we work in a specific situation, lot of skills, strategies and methods are generalizable to lots of difficult clients. 

00:06:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

00:06:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Okay. Thanks, Norma. 

00:06:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:06:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Let's see what's gonna happen. 

00:06:05
RALPH PACKARD control the interview and ingratiate himself Throughout this video, note how Norma must maintain her own position and not allow herself to be manipulated by Ralph. But, she must also win his trust. 

00:06:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Hi Ralph, I'm Doctor Gluckstern. 

00:06:40
RALPH PACKARD Hi. 

00:06:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, ah, I gather, the court has send you here. If I look at my report for something like six to eight months for us to see each other. And I hope before we went on, ah, I'd be interested to know what your, you know, how come they sent you here, how you see the incident. 

00:06:55
RALPH PACKARD  Well, I was hoping you could tell me. 

00:07:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, that's a possibility, but, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
RALPH PACKARD I mean, I don't know why I'm here, you know, I talked to the judge and he's, you know, and he says, "You either get two and a half years in jail, or, or, if you don't cooperate with probation, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put you in jail for two and a half years. So, he referred me here with the, ah, probation department, to come and talk to, to somebody and, and here I am. And, and I don't know why I'm here. 

00:07:25
Non-judgmental question 

00:07:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, could you tell me what exactly was the incident that, that made- (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
RALPH PACKARD No, it was- (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - the judge made that, ah,- 

00:07:30
Classical denial 

00:07:30
RALPH PACKARD - it was- (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - request. 

00:07:30
RALPH PACKARD - nothing. It was a normal kind of argument between a husband and wife. And some neighbor got nervous and called the police. 

00:07:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  The neighbor got, ah, was there more to it than, than this husband and wife argument. It seem to me that it was a little bit more elaborate on the case study that. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, that's the, why the police came. And then, you know, one thing led to another and I wound up in court. 

00:07:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Would you, ah, I think that, that's interesting 'coz I think that's what you want to ask me, but I also thought that there was a scene in a, a barroom that was (inaudible ) (crosstalk). 

00:08:07
RALPH PACKARD Oh, that was afterwards. I mean, that was the second time they called- (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:08:10
RALPH PACKARD - the police. And, and, ah, it's because I found out about this guy she had been seeing, and I met him in a barroom, and I tried to be nice to him, and talked to him, and, and, ah, things got nasty, and he made a very bad mistake, and, uhm, and I hit him. 

00:08:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN He made a bad mistake. 

00:08:30
RALPH PACKARD Yes, he made it. It wasn't me. I mean, it's my wife, and, you know, he was running around with my wife. I, you know, I was just in there having a drink, and there he was. 

00:08:35
Search for concreteness 

00:08:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Did he, ah, was there, was there some word exchanged or how did that happen? 

00:08:40
RALPH PACKARD Well, yeah, we started talking and, you know, I thought things are going pretty well. And then he got angry and, ah, and I didn't do anything to make him angry, but he got angry. So, ah, I thought he was reaching for a gun. It turned out he did have a gun. So, I hit him. I hit him fairly hard. And I wound up in front of the judge again for that. And, and, ah, he said, "Look. There is no choice. You either go for counseling and, and, ah, let's see if we can get to the bottom of this, or you gonna have to go to jail. So I'm here. Now I wanna know, you know, I'm interested if you can help me. And maybe, ah, do something to make, ah, you know, the judge kinda lighten up on the two and half years in jail. 

00:09:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So, you see my helping you would be to somehow get the judge, or to, to, to make the judge to lessen the sentence, or at least accept the fact that you've come to therapy. 

00:09:40
Ralph seeks to control 

00:09:40
RALPH PACKARD Well, I, I'll be more willing to, to participate and contribute. But I, I, I'm kinda interested in what, you know, you're gonna do for me, if you can help me with the judge. I'm perfectly willing to cooperate and help, but I need, you know, some kind of reassurance that, ah, that I'm gonna get some assistance from you. 

00:10:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. So what you- (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
RALPH PACKARD Your recommendation, whatever. 

00:10:00
Summary of Ralph's goal 

00:10:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, well, if you're saying that you're gonna, what you want from me, is that if you continue coming, that by somehow by the end of the six months or eight months that you're gonna be here, that I'm gonna recommend to the judge that you've done your time, and to release you any further. Is that, that's, that's what your going, is it. 

00:10:20
RALPH PACKARD Oh, that's, that would be wonderful. I'd like that. Yes. 

00:10:20
In the next section, note how Ralph continually seeks to avoid responsibility. 

00:10:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What are you gonna do to make that happen? 

00:10:30
RALPH PACKARD Oh, I'm gonna help, now, whatever you ask me, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest with you. I'll tell you the truth. I'll be, I'll be right upfront with you, ah, no problem. 

00:10:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, whatever I ask you, you're gonna be out in the truth with me, outfront? 

00:10:45
RALPH PACKARD Truthful. I'll be very truthful. I won't lie. I'm not, you know, I'm not here to, to, ah, I'm here to try to help myself. I, I admit that. I wanna, I don't wanna go to jail for two and a half years. Ah, and I'm willing to, ah, to do, what you gonna tell me what you want me to do. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, certainly, one of the things you're gonna do is to come and, and maybe talk about yourself. Is that something that you're interested in doing? 

00:11:10
RALPH PACKARD  Well, if it's gonna help me. Ah.(crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, you're willing. 

00:11:15
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:11:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:11:15
RALPH PACKARD  Yes. 

00:11:20
Norma seeks behavioral concreteness 

00:11:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So we're gonna explore your behavior and that's okay with you. Do you feel comfortable with that? 

00:11:20
RALPH PACKARD Sure. If it's gonna help me, I'll be very willing to that. 

00:11:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay, let me ask you a question. Has that, when did that happen or how is that happen in a bar before? You see, I'm looking at your case and it looks like there's been some other fights that what you had in the bars before. 

00:11:40
Denial of responsiblity 

00:11:40
RALPH PACKARD  Well, you know, I guess I'm just unlucky. When I go places, I, you know, I don't mean to any harm to people. And I get talked into somebody and next thing I know, you know, they get, they get violent and, you know, I, I can't let them get over on me. I'm gonna have to handle it. So, I do. And, ah, I don't give them anything they don't ask for. 

00:12:00
Non-judgmental attitude essential 

00:12:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. So this is, most of the fights that you've gotten into, which I look are substantial, was other people's fault. It wasn't the, you sort of got into it, broke into it, basically. 

00:12:15
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, I think I'm just, you know, happen to be in the wrong place at the right time. And, and, you know, I don't mean any harm by it. I go in there to have a drink, and have a little fun, and you run into these people, I guess from there, I don't know. I thought best I can tell you. 

00:12:30
Closed question/confrontation 

00:12:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Allright. So, uhm, have you ever had to bump into somebody like me before? 

00:12:35
RALPH PACKARD  No, no. 

00:12:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, is that gonna be different? Are you gonna sort of, ah, be always right and, and I'm gonna be wrong? 

00:12:45
RALPH PACKARD  Well, I don't know. That's a hard question to answer. 

00:12:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. That's hard question. 

00:12:50
RALPH PACKARD Yes, yes. It's a very difficult question. Ah, I don't think that my, my record is that bad. It's a, I've been a victim of circumstances in a number of occasions. Ah, I don't take a whole lot of grief from people if somebody gets in my face. Ah, they're in trouble. I mean, I'll tell them one time, "Get away from me," and if they don't, that's it. That's it. 

00:13:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So. 

00:13:15
RALPH PACKARD I think that's fair. That's a fair way of treating people. 

00:13:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's fair. Okay. Fair enough. But, I don't get into your face because- (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, but you're gonna do something to help me. 

00:13:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
RALPH PACKARD These guys had done, aren't gonna do anything now. 

00:13:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So you're saying because you can, I might get, you might get something from me. 

00:13:30
RALPH PACKARD Why? Assuming that if- 

00:13:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:13:30
RALPH PACKARD - after six months, and the judge is gonna get a report. And I hope It's gonna be, you know, ah, in my best interest. And, that's what I'd hope we can accomplish here. 

00:13:45
Defining relationship 

00:13:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, I know my role. But what will your role be in accomplishing that. Because that's how I think what you're here for. And maybe I'm here to be sure that that happens. But I might make, I might make some demands on you, is, how's that gonna work out? 

00:14:00
RALPH PACKARD I don't know. I've never had a lot of demands placed on me that, ah, for too long. 

00:14:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay, so that's gonna be difficult. 

00:14:05
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:14:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:14:05
Ralph sees interview as inquisition 

00:14:05
RALPH PACKARD Alright. I don't handle demands well at all. 

00:14:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Are you, are you warning me? 

00:14:15
RALPH PACKARD No. I'm just being honest with you. 

00:14:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:14:15
RALPH PACKARD I wanna be perfectly honest here. I wanna, you know, be straightforward with you. 

00:14:20
Summary of joint goals 

00:14:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. I'll, I'll accept that. I'll accept what you're saying is, is straightforward. But I think that at this point, we need to be sure that we understand that, and I understand your goal, and I understand your goal is to do your six to eight months, so that you can be released from the courts. And my goal will be to ensure the courts that you've done that properly. Now, how does that feel for you? How do you like that? 

00:14:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think right about now, I'll do, I'll do what I can to, to, to work this out. 

00:14:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So you will, we can kind of work some kind of an arrangement? 

00:15:00
RALPH PACKARD I do not wanna go to jail for two and half years. 

00:15:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay. And I don't want you to go to jail for two and half years. 

00:15:05
RALPH PACKARD So are you gonna help me? 

00:15:05
Norma stresses Ralph's responsibility 

00:15:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, you're gonna help yourself. 

00:15:10
RALPH PACKARD Oh, okay. 

00:15:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, that, that sounds pretty strange to you, doesn't it? You can help yourself. 

00:15:15
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, it does. Ah, it does. 

00:15:20
(Five minutes delete here) Now, the interview continues. Note Ralph's continuous challenge and Norma's focus on joint goals. Key clarification of goals 

00:15:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And I've got something for you I want you to do. Because, if you got to be, If I've got to eventually write the courts, so I'd think you, looking at the, the behavior, this gotten you into trouble through the years, which it has. I mean, you have to acknowledge that. That I want you to do one thing, ah, for this week, and think about. When you get that urge, when you begin to feel that you're being imposed upon, when you feel that, okay, what right has he got to ask that of me? Does that make any sense to you or not? Do you understand what I'm saying? 

00:16:00
RALPH PACKARD I understand. 

00:16:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Because everything that's happened to you has been something is, somehow you're in a barroom, and something was said, and you got into this fight. 

00:16:05
Ralph again denies responsibility 

00:16:05
RALPH PACKARD Well, somebody shoots their mouth off, they- (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:16:10
RALPH PACKARD - they say something that's inappropriate that's wrong, and that, ah, you know, reflects on me, and, and, ah, and I'm gonna take issue with that everytime. 

00:16:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So, what I think I'm gonna ask you to do, 'coz this gonna happen during the week, is once try not to take issue. What would happen if you didn't take issue? 'Coz isn't taking issue part of why you're here? 

00:16:30
RALPH PACKARD  Yes. Could be. 

00:16:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What do you mean by "Could be"? 

00:16:40
RALPH PACKARD Well. 

00:16:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN What do you mean by "Could be"? 

00:16:40
RALPH PACKARD I mean, because I was told to be here. ah, I'm, you know- (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I understand that. 

00:16:45
RALPH PACKARD - okay. 

00:16:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, but you didn't. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
RALPH PACKARD I don't have any choice really. I'm here. 

00:16:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So the difference being here than when that happens in a barroom is you have some choices here. 

00:16:55
RALPH PACKARD I have choices. 

00:16:55
Focus on choice 

00:16:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So one of things we're gonna look at is what about the, have the choices you've made, And you've made the choices, have they paid off for you over the last few years. 

00:17:05
RALPH PACKARD You know, I think they'd paid off. 

00:17:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Tell me how. 

00:17:10
Sill denies ability to choose 

00:17:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, I have a reputation, you know, that the- (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh. 

00:17:10
RALPH PACKARD - people know that when I go into a place that they leave me alone. If they don't, they're gonna get wacked. 'Coz I'm not gonna take a lot of gut for them. Uhm, that's it, you know. And I don't go looking for trouble. Do not go looking for trouble. I walk in. I wanna drink. I'm willing to talk to somebody. But if somebody gets on my case, you know, I'm not gonna put up with it. I don't tolerate that. 

00:17:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You said something interesting just now. That people know they can't take advantage of you. They can't. 

00:17:40
RALPH PACKARD Sure. 

00:17:40
Series of closed, focused questions 

00:17:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN How did that, how did that happen? 

00:17:45
RALPH PACKARD Well, I've been that way for a long time. 

00:17:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. How did that happen? 

00:17:50
RALPH PACKARD I, I have no idea how it happened. It just, you know, it's just the way, it's just the way I am. That's, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'll ask another question then. Do you like it? 

00:18:00
RALPH PACKARD  Well, I don't like it right now. Ah, it's, I guess- (crosstalk) 

00:18:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're smiling. 

00:18:05
RALPH PACKARD - I'm here. 

00:18:05
Watch Ralph make "some" self-exploration in the next few comments. 

00:18:05
RALPH PACKARD  I'm here, and, ah, I'm gonna have to be here, ah, once a week for six months. Uhm, no, I'm not happy about that. I don't think that paid off for me, no. 

00:18:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. So this is one time where you can say the kind of behavior had, didn't have a payoff, not the kind of payoff you wanted. 

00:18:30
RALPH PACKARD That's, yes. Yeah, I would say that's fair. 

00:18:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  All right. So there maybe, in the end, I think the judge's hoping that in fact there will be a payoff. That by being forced into this situation, and you were forced into the situation- (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:18:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - ah, you might think again in situations that have gotten you into this position might change. 'Coz that is some place easier than going to court. 

00:18:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, the judge did suggest that I don't go of anymore barrooms. 

00:18:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I don't know what that. 

00:19:00
RALPH PACKARD Ah, I don't' know if he can, ah, He didn't say, you can't, but he says, maybe you shouldn't go to barrooms. Ahh. (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, why do you think he said, "Maybe, you shouldn't go to barrooms." 

00:19:05
RALPH PACKARD Well, I don't know if he was joking, or, or what it was about. But I'd, you know, I, I, I remember him say that. 

00:19:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, ah, as I look at here, I think the reason he said that is where you somehow- (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:19:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - when you go into bar rooms, that's when you get into trouble. Not because- (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
RALPH PACKARD Sure. 

00:19:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - going to barrooms would be necessarily wrong. But maybe what he was saying to you is that somehow in that barroom, something happens to your behavior. Something different happens when you're in that barroom. 

00:19:35
RALPH PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're smiling again. 

00:19:35
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, well. It's, There's a lot of guys in the barroom. They're somewhat like me. You know- (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay. 

00:19:45
RALPH PACKARD - and, and, ah, we usually have a lot of fun, but now and then, you know, somebody goes too far. And, ah, you know, something happens. I don't think anybody means any harm by it. But it happens. 

00:19:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But somebody harmful could happen, like you do- (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:19:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - with that, that scene where somebody might have been hurt. 

00:20:00
RALPH PACKARD Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Once that gun came out, somebody seriously could get hurt. 

00:20:00
RALPH PACKARD Well, once I saw he had a gun, that changed everything. 

00:20:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:20:05
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, yes. 

00:20:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And that could happen again. 

00:20:05
RALPH PACKARD  Yes. 

00:20:10
Norma reinforces his observation 

00:20:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so that maybe is an important issue to you, ah, to, to, to think about. Uhm, before we go a little further, 'coz I think that's an important thing that the judge said to you, and that, that is something that, ah, you don't wanna walk out going to barrooms. But maybe what you wanna do is "How do I control when I go to a barroom?" 

00:20:25
Here and now relationship 

00:20:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uhm, you know, we're, we're almost, our hour is almost up. What is your reaction? Are you comfortable coming here? What is it working with me? 

00:20:35
RALPH PACKARD Oh, I'm comfortable now that I'll know that you're gonna help me. And. (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So, it's based on- (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
RALPH PACKARD - and, ah, you're gonna- (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - all right. 

00:20:45
Some progress in session 

00:20:45
RALPH PACKARD - write a good report for me, and the judge is gonna look favorable on me, and I'm not gonna have to go to jail. Yes, I'm much more comfortable than I was when I came here. I admit it. 

00:20:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But when did you get the impression that I was automatically gonna write a good report for you. 

00:20:55
Still seeking control 

00:20:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, we've discussed it, you know, I'm satisfied that you'll keep your word, and, ah, and I, I'm comfortable with it now. 

00:21:05
Norma keeps session on track 

00:21:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN My sense is that I never gave you the word. I said that providing we accomplish some things. I would write the. (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, yeah, but I assume we're gonna accomplish something. 

00:21:15
Clarification of goals again 

00:21:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, all right. And, ah, and- (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:21:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All set in the ground rules to me. So we get clear what the goals are. I understand that I need that you date for me in six to eight months, ah, of, something that says, yes, that you've attended counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
RALPH PACKARD You didn't say six to eight months, did you? 

00:21:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I did say six to eight months? 

00:21:35
RALPH PACKARD I. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That is what it said in the. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
RALPH PACKARD Well, I thought it was six months. And, ah, you know, maybe I misunderstood, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. It's, it, well, the six months probably is up to you. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
RALPH PACKARD I didn't have that report in front of me. 

00:21:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:21:45
RALPH PACKARD Or I wasn't allowed to see it. 

00:21:45
Clarification of goals 

00:21:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. The six or eight months are in my report. But that's gonna require- (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:21:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - that, that one of the things that you're gonna have to do is for you to look at your behavior, and see the relationship between your behavior and why you have a folder of so many minor access, but you've encountered the law or you've been encountered in your report, something that's brought you some problems. And so one of the things that I have to be honest with you is I'm gonna make you look at that. 

00:22:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, that's fair enough. All right. 

00:22:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You look like you're gonna tolerate it right now. 

00:22:20
RALPH PACKARD I'm gonna work very hard. I'm gonna try. I'll try very hard. 

00:22:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. And then I'd have to, I'm gonna have to try very hard. I'm gonna try very hard not to get angry at you. 

00:22:35
RALPH PACKARD I'm, you know, pretty easy to get along with, actually, the truth of the matter is. 

00:22:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. You're also very- (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
RALPH PACKARD (inaudible ) 

00:22:43
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - you're also, ah, very good at, uh coming across, as a, as a, ah, compliant kind of person. 

00:22:50
RALPH PACKARD Oh, absolutely. Yes. 

00:22:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:22:50
RALPH PACKARD Completely. 

00:22:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, I don't, I, I think we, I think we've accomplished enough. When you come back next week, if you go into the barroom again which you may think, think twice about doing as a matter of fact, and if you do and something happens in that barroom, can you control you're behavior at a level? That's asking you a lot on the first round but at least maybe think about it because you do have this thing hanging over you. 

00:23:20
RALPH PACKARD I understand, yeah. 

00:23:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. Well, see you next week. 

00:23:25
RALPH PACKARD All right. Thank you. 

00:23:30
Discussion of First Session 

00:23:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY  RALPH PACKARD , who's doing the role play here so well a has a lot of experience with this area. In fact, he was warden of the Maryland House of Corrections. So, thanks Ralph for doing this. You know what these people are like- (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
RALPH PACKARD I do. 

00:23:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY - and, ah, provide a great demonstration. I think I might start though, well, I think I'll start with you Ralph. Well, what were you're impressions of Norma's work? 

00:24:00
RALPH PACKARD  Well, what I think struck me is how difficult it must be, ah, as we've had experience with working with people, ah, that, that are able to a manipulate you so well, and to, to give you answers but at the same time, not give you answers and it was very hard for me to do that but I'd, I'd did some of it but I, I can understand how difficult it must be for a counselor or a therapist to have to work with, ah, with people that are so good at this kind of behavior. 

00:24:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
RALPH PACKARD And it, it really kinda hit me, ah, more than it, you know, I used to accept the fact that I dealt with people like this on a day to day basis. 

00:24:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
RALPH PACKARD And became used to it, it, it was kinda of a survival, ah, technique. But, I guess it kinda hit me what it must be like for, maybe I never really appreciated that, what must be like for a therapist to have to sit down one-on-one and try to do therapy. 

00:25:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, you know what those manipulation , can you give us a specific example where you're doing a little manipulation on how you saw her responding which might have been useful? 

00:25:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, I thought that she stuck to the, she, she kind of like kept moving towards what she wanted to accomplish with- (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY She kept her agenda rather near her agenda. 

00:25:25
RALPH PACKARD - to get me to say that, you know, I was gonna try to participate, I was gonna be active, I was gonna try and contribute and that I was gonna have to be there for so many months, and if I didn't then probably I was gonna go back to jail that, in other words, there was kinda im- implied a threat that she would have the right to report that might you know put me back in jail. That's the way I felt. 

00:25:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY  So, do you feel that she held her power? 

00:25:55
RALPH PACKARD I think so, she had. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN If she hadn't held her power, what would have happened? 

00:26:00
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think I would have taken advantage of her, ah, yeah. 

00:26:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Okay, Norma, what are your thoughts? 

00:26:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I was conscious of trying to keep this focus on what he had to do and I, I recognize to some extent I was making this implying that if he didn't, he might not go into jail. And at some level I was, ah, aware that I would just become one more authority figure in his world and how he's gonna manipulate me. 

00:26:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so, what I was hoping that for the next area that we got together, in the next phase, that I could establish more of a rapport with him where he would not, I think that he always see me as an authority figure but maybe an authority figure he can trust. And it was worth listening to someone saying things like, I might sort of suggestions, I might like may I ask to, to look at his behavior in a barroom. But, I was concerned that I may have, ah, overset that bond and, and he was smart, he knew, smart enough not to be turned off because he knew I had this power but I didn't wanna use the power in a way that would have know-how to establish a relationship. 

00:27:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Now in terms of micro-skills and listening skills and so forth, what are your thoughts on that? 

00:27:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, perhaps, ah, I wasn't thinking too much about them. I think I really was asking questions and doing attended behavior. I don't think I did any of the other skills at this point. I, I think that initial interview was just trying to stick with those two, not but. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY There's a major difference at the same time, is that pretending you wanna stay with the client's topic, that you're attending behavior is you're laying of the topic. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's right. Which is very- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY You're trying to get the client to attend while you're attending to that- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - which makes- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY - without getting off-track. 

00:27:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - which is very expected(ph) but it really was attending to my need without being distruptive to his needs. 

00:27:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And that's the comp. (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY That's a different type of attending behavior. 

00:27:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh-huh. 

00:27:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY It's also a different, different type of therapeutic alliance. How would you describe the therapeutic alliance? Or, is there one? Is it building? 

00:28:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, ah, maybe ask Ralph first, I mean, I know what I was trying to establish in the alliance is that maybe we were more of an equal footing as opposed to my being in a power position. 

00:28:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, I kinda found that, ah, that sometimes the, some of the, ah, skills that you used on me, stopped me from going where I wanted to go- (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:28:30
RALPH PACKARD - with the conversation, and I had to kind of pull back a little bit. I couldn't get what I wanted out of that. 

00:28:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Can you identify a specific point? 

00:28:40
RALPH PACKARD Well, yeah if you know something down to or somebody can't move outside that box- (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
RALPH PACKARD - and you can't use that, ah, I kind of like I was trying to create the role that the person that I was trying to create would be one that would use communications to, ah, get what they wanted out of the conversation, and I wasn't getting that. 

00:29:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
RALPH PACKARD I was getting close. but I was not getting that. And it, it was frustrating me a little bit and I was trying not to show it, but at the same time, ah, I was trying to find a way to, to break through that and, ah, the, the theories, I think the theory of counseling would have worked more in my favor. When she started using real, like, ah, open-ended questions, and things of that nature and, and then I would answer and then she would answer, and I asked her another question that would be a little different, a close question. I find it harder than to, to get to where I wanted to go. I had to think more about what I wanted to say. 

00:29:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
RALPH PACKARD It, it didn't create a free flow of information- (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
RALPH PACKARD - that I could give that would make me look the way I wanted to look. 

00:30:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY That's a very different purpose is that the- (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:30:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY - to help you get on track openly. She needs to kinda hold you on that track- (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
RALPH PACKARD Oh yeah. 

00:30:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY - and let you, rather than let you off. 

00:30:10
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:30:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY I was kinda intrigued with some of the discussions around the bar, and I wondered how you reacted to, to those and how a, how a anti-social client might react to some of those discussions. 

00:30:20
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think the bar question was one that the bar is kind of a place where anything goes, I mean, you can go in a bar and you can, there's no real, ah, there's no rules in there or decency or anything, you can be as wild as you want, you can say what you want, you can essentially do what you want within limits, and, ah, every now and then, it gets outside those limits. 

00:30:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
RALPH PACKARD  But, she took some of that away from me or kinda restricted my ability to, ah, have that freedom. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
RALPH PACKARD And wanted to, you know, suggesting that maybe you don't go to a bar- 

00:31:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-hum. 

00:31:00
RALPH PACKARD - ah, which essentially what the judge was saying (inaudible ) (crosstalk). 

00:31:09
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But I think that what, in terms, I would say that if you do go the bar because I know I can't really tell you not to go to a bar then these, these are the constraints I wanna- (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:31:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - put on you when you go to that bar and that was, well, in my mind, not to, not to say you can't go to the bar, but go to that bar, that's part of your life but learn how to put some constraints on it. 

00:31:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Now, as we get ready for the, ah, second session, what type of setup do you need to set us up for that? What's gonna happen? 

00:31:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY What are we going to be? 

00:31:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - I think what we're gonna be is really now going on we're exploring a problem, a more, maybe more at a personal, what are his problems in terms of his behavior that he could perhaps look at those, his behavior and how's that created all sorts of problems for him. And I would see that, as the second phase, and then that would be using some of the paraphrasing, we could look at the issue of reflection feelings, and, ah, maybe even of somewhat a some confrontations and so forth- (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - but not in the problem-solving but more what is the problem- (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - beyond the fact that you make a, beyond the fact that you, if you don't come and see me,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - you're gonna go to jail. 

00:32:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY So this next brief segment will be about how would be next week or two weeks later? 

00:32:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, this would probably be maybe three, four weeks later. We probably, I would say it will take a little why before we get to that point where he would be willing to say okay there are some behavioral problems that I'm gonna address. 

00:32:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, basically these first three weeks are gonna be some continuation of what's goin on here- (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Of what was going on, yeah. 

00:32:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY - on this short discussion. That's still kind of a struggle for power and keeping you on track. 

00:32:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Sure. 

00:32:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY And the therapeutic alliance has begun with, kind of a long way to go yet. 

00:32:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Long way to go. 

00:32:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Okay. We can't show all in twenty minutes, so let's stop now and you could go on with three weeks later. We'll see what happens. 

00:32:50
Second Session A delicate balance Between confrontation and clarification: exploring the client's problem 

00:32:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Hi Ralph. Uhm, let me just go back for a while. In our last session, you said that one of the things we're gonna talk about was that you somehow allow, that you acknowledged some of your behavior is, is your fault and you seemed to, you're willing to confront that. Am I, am I right? Or ah. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
RALPH PACKARD Of course, I'm willing to confront them. 

00:33:25
Exploration of anger 

00:33:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  So, that you're willing. So, you think that your anger may have been part of the reason that some of these instance took place? 

00:33:35
RALPH PACKARD No. I don't think so at all. Not at all. If people, you know, knew how to respect my, you know, me and treated me decently, I wouldn't react violently. There's no way I'm going to do that. I'm not that kind of a person. I don't want that to happen. 

00:33:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. You don't want it to happen, but you allowed it to happen. 

00:33:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, people make mistakes and they say the wrong things and, ah, and then I don't let this go by. I, I don't let it go by. 

00:34:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Which is going back over and over the fact that you won't look at your role in that behavior that somehow I can, I can allow you or I can create your anger but that has nothing to do with you. 

00:34:10
RALPH PACKARD  I don't know what you're talking about. What, what do you mean by that? 

00:34:20
Anger in the here and now 

00:34:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN What I mean is that if you get annoyed with me or, or I think you're angry with me. 

00:34:25
RALPH PACKARD I'm annoyed right now. 

00:34:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I know I can sense that. But you're blaming that on to me, that you're saying has nothing to do with the way you look at the way things are happening. 

00:34:30
RALPH PACKARD  Look, I am here trying to, you know, trying to cooperate with you. I'm trying to, to help. I know what's at stake for myself and I'm trying very hard, and you keep asking me the same questions over and over and over again everytime I come here. 

00:34:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN What's questions that I'm saying over and over again that were bothering you? 

00:34:55
Ralph finally moves to self-exploration 

00:34:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, these questions about like, you know, my behavior- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:34:55
RALPH PACKARD - it's, it's like my behavior is so wrong. I'm responsible for myself. I can't be responsible for other people on what they, if they provoke my, my anger, it's not my fault, it's not my fault. I don't go out my way to, to look for trouble when I go into a barroom or when I'm anywhere, the supermarket, anywhere else, but if other people use bad judgment and make mistakes so, you know, I can't be I'm not responsible for that. 

00:35:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. If I agree with you that other people are making mistakes but your in the up perhaps going to jail, what's the payoff for you and your behavior then? 

00:35:45
RALPH PACKARD So, what does that mean, that in order not to go to jail that I've got to take crap all the time from people? They can say whatever they want to me, they can push me around, you know, they can make a fool out of me and I'm forced to say "Oh I'm not gonna to do that because I would go to jail?" That's, that's not fair. Does everybody have to do that? Why just me? 

00:36:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I don't think just you, but not everybody is in jail and- (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, I'm not in jail yet. 

00:36:10
In the next section, watch problem solving start while Ralph continues to resist. 

00:36:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, but that's the prospect that you have? 

00:36:20
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:36:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, what I'm trying to get you to look at is to what extent you allow other people to control your behavior because that's what you're saying. You're saying, "Okay, I can't manage you" then, then you're ready to get mad. You're allowing me to control your behavior. You're allowing me to have you lose your temper, do whatever you do in the bar, end up you're the one who's in court. So, you're giving me the power rather than yourself taking the power. Have you ever thought of it in that way? 

00:36:55
RALPH PACKARD No. 

00:36:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Why? 

00:36:55
RALPH PACKARD No. No, I never thought of it that way. 

00:37:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, that sort of, that sort of quieted you down. It was sort of like I, I, I see you thinking or at least, reflecting on what I just said. 

00:37:10
RALPH PACKARD  So what have I gotta do? I mean, like, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, no, no , no. Let's just. 

00:37:15
RALPH PACKARD - walk around like some, some kind of a wimp or something? And not say anything and stand up for myself and what I believe in? I can't do that anymore? I've got to give all that up because ah, the judge thinks that I've gotta do it or you think I gotta do it? 

00:37:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No. 

00:37:35
RALPH PACKARD I mean. 

00:37:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Then you're not, you're not hearing what I'm saying. 

00:37:40
Here and now relationship 

00:37:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That if I can make you that angry- (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
RALPH PACKARD I'm angry right now. 

00:37:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - that I'm, that I'm controlling your behavior rather than you saying, how come you can't just say, "Well, you know, so that's what she thinks. I'm gonna go and do something else." What I'm saying is I'm getting, I'm trying to make you think a different way because you're giving me the power. I'm not gonna go to jail. You're gonna go to jail if you lose your temper. So you're allowing me to provoke you and I'm just saying that there's another way to look at it. You're thinking, you're thinking that because I've demonstrated my power, "Well I'm just gonna tell her off." Rather than say, "Well, that's not, I'm not gonna fall into that trap with her." 

00:38:20
RALPH PACKARD Well, I, I think I have been very respectful of you since, well, I've been coming here. I've been making ah, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You've been doing that. 

00:38:30
RALPH PACKARD - very strong effort to try and to cooperate. 

00:38:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think you have. 

00:38:30
RALPH PACKARD How much of, I could do? How much more have I gotta give up? 

00:38:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No, no. You're misunderstanding. When I'm using "me", forget it. We're not in a barroom. I'm in a barroom. I'm gonna start a fight with you. I'm gonna call you names. You're gonna slug me. And so I've controlled your behavior. I'm just using "me" as the example. 

00:38:50
RALPH PACKARD I don't think if I slugged you that that means you've controlled my behavior. 

00:38:55
Reframing of doing nothing as strength 

00:38:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I have, because you're the one who's gonna go to jail. But if you, if I get, if I, if I provoke you, and you just turn away and you know, sort of. So what do I care? I mean, I'm not even gonna get to his level. Wouldn't that be a different way of dealing, in keeping, protecting yourself? 

00:39:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Not that you necessarily are irritated with him, but number one is how I protect myself from doing something that I'm gonna get in trouble. 

00:39:20
RALPH PACKARD You know, you're right. Maybe- 

00:39:20
Ralph reflects on a new definition of manhood 

00:39:20
RALPH PACKARD - I could do that. Maybe I could do that. Maybe I could just, kinda, laugh and walk away. What do I do with this person persists and follows up and continues. What do I do then? 

00:39:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I, I think that- (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
RALPH PACKARD Do I do it a second time? 

00:39:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No. 

00:39:40
RALPH PACKARD Or do I hit him? 

00:39:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No, what I guess would, guess I would do, I would say, "Well, what's, what are my options and how do I come out of this better? 'Coz I'm not gonna let this guy get me in trouble. And so, if that requires my just, say, leaving the bar. 

00:39:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, word's gonna get around real quick. You know, hey- (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ok. 

00:40:00
RALPH PACKARD - you can say anything you want to this guy. He's not gonna do anything to you. He's gonna let it go. 

00:40:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But what if, you know, that, that, that's very important. 

00:40:05
RALPH PACKARD That's not very. 

00:40:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  But then, that's, that's really important because what you're saying is a lot of, if you do that, you're giving up your reputation. You're giving up a piece of yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
Significant self-disclosure 

00:40:15
RALPH PACKARD Maybe giving up my manhood by doing that. 

00:40:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ok. That's the gist. So, in other words, if you- 

00:40:20
Paraphrase of key word "manhood" 

00:40:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - change this behavior, you have a vision of your manhood that requires that you fight back or you, or you, an eye for an eye. And if you change that, that somehow is gonna give up a piece of yourself. 

00:40:35
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:40:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Is that what I'm hearing? 

00:40:35
RALPH PACKARD That's correct. That's right. Absolutely. I won't be able to walk down the street. It won't give me peace at all. 

00:40:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  But it goes back to, will you get any peace if you get yourself into serious trouble? 

00:40:50
RALPH PACKARD I didn't get into fights that often, I've been in maybe eight to ten fights in- (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I know. 

00:40:55
RALPH PACKARD - three or four years. 

00:41:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But those eight or ten fights have had, have been costly for you. They've been costly. I think you're, I think you're awry(ph) about this. I'm, that if you give up this piece. So maybe the issue is how much of a piece are you gonna give up? Is there something that you can do so that you still can maintain your manhood, still feel good about yourself? 

00:41:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And not have to get into, you know, a bar or a brawl, or whatever it is. That, that, maybe there are other things that you want in life that would make you feel that you are a man? 

00:41:30
RALPH PACKARD Give me an example, if you can. 

00:41:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You know, you think about it. 

00:41:35
RALPH PACKARD Well, I have. I can't think of, ah, you know, you have to stand up for yourself. You've got to- (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But you see it only as physical. 

00:41:40
Search for Ralph's strengths 

00:41:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Are there any ways, I mean, there other things that would make you feel good about yourself besides the fact that you're a very physically strong man? Is there some other stuff that would make you feel good about yourself? 

00:41:50
RALPH PACKARD Well. (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, okay.(crosstalk) 

00:41:55
RALPH PACKARD I don't know what it, but ah. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
Reframing, connects to concrete reality 

00:41:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right, I've got an idea because I heard you talk about how you admired, uhm, somebody that you have met when you were in the service, who was very, who had gotten involved in karate. Or is it judo? I don't remember. But you said, Here was somebody that was always in fights", and what he did, in fact, you'd even say he was a big drinker, was find another way that would not be as destructive to himself but still allow him to feel good about his manhood. Is there something that you might enjoy doing? That you would associate with manhood? 

00:42:35
Note that Norma now uses Ralph's word "manhood" to facilitate change. 

00:42:35
RALPH PACKARD  Yes, that's possible. 

00:42:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN What, what sort of thing? I mean let's, let's explore this. 

00:42:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, I thought of taking up boxing before, you know, just to, maybe vent some of my energy a little bit or to let it out, and ah, it's a good form of exercise. And it's a release. Yeah, I thought of that. 

00:43:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. I'm sort of listening 'coz I think what we've arrived at, a little bit is that, for you to give up, a sort of a bar and brawls that you'd be giving up a piece of yourself, of manhood. That manhood is very important for you. And what I have been suggesting is that maybe there's another way of still having manhood but one that would give you satisfaction and keep you out of, out of any serious problems. And you're saying, you know, one of the things you thought about is, is going to a boxing, going in, is there a gymnasium where you could sort of take up boxing and sort of enjoy that? 

00:43:40
RALPH PACKARD Well, you're around a different kind of people, when you're in a, a boxing gymnasium. You're around people that are aware of what, what it's all about. And, ah, they don't give anybody any grief and they don't give you any grief. You don't give them any. It's kind of like a, everybody is the same. They kind of respect each other. 

00:44:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  So also, pointing out something else that, that I had thought we'd gotten into was the environment that ah, does the environment, how you live, who you, when you're in that boxing, when you're at that gym. It's a bunch of guys that are (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:44:21
RALPH PACKARD They work hard. They're, they, they're doin this ah, what they like and they're, they're struggling to, ah, get to be better boxers. They haven't got time for any nonsense, ah, so it's a pretty easy place to be in and not get in any trouble. Most people wouldn't believe that, I know, but it's very true. 

00:44:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right,- 

00:44:40
Emphasis on environment 

00:44:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - so you're saying something that, that that maybe one thing would be helpful to you is to look at the environment you're in, and is that creating some of the problems for you. 

00:44:55
RALPH PACKARD It may be, maybe just in lieu of barrooms, kind of, like going that direction a little bit, uhm, it might ah, it might ah, work. 

00:45:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Because I think it's important that you keep your manhood. I mean I think that's who, that's a piece of who you are. And the only thing I'm saying is that there's a variety of ways of doing that. And one way, because you're a physical- (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
RALPH PACKARD I'm a pretty good boxer right now. 

00:45:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - is, is (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:45:22
RALPH PACKARD - and I haven't had a lot of professional training, but I'm, a pretty good boxer in my own right, right now. 

00:45:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:45:25
RALPH PACKARD So I wouldn't be getting, I gained something I wouldn't, ah, be giving anything up. Do I understand what, what. (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, I think you understand it, and ah,- 

00:45:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, I think you understand it and I think- 

00:45:35
Summary of key manhood issue 

00:45:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - what I'm trying to (inaudible ) is, I think that, that, that I've understood something about you. That, that I'm beginning to understand how important it is for you to keep your manhood. And if I can share something with you, ah, it's, it, it's sort of like for women, I have a certain amount of vanity. 

00:46:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So I go and I have to get my nails done. 

00:46:00
RALPH PACKARD Uhm. 

00:46:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I have to take care and that's being part of a woman and you're saying being part of a manhood (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:46:09
RALPH PACKARD You're right. For men, you know, if, if people are afraid of you, that means you've got some status and, ah, and maybe being in a barroom and getting into trouble where, isn't a way for me in getting that respect. Maybe I could do it through, through boxing. People are gonna know I'm a boxer and, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:46:30
RALPH PACKARD - they're gonna, word will get out and, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN They might stay away from you. 

00:46:35
RALPH PACKARD They'll leave me alone, maybe. It's very possible. I'm willing to think about that. 

00:46:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right, that is a. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
RALPH PACKARD Maybe give it a, you know, try. I could try that out, ah, you know, and see how it works. 

00:46:45
Exploration of anger 

00:46:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, well, I think that, is there anything else that you might like to, to talk about today? 'Coz as we have come to a summary that one of, 'coz one of the things that we set was in this phase, we're gonna talk about finding out, figuring out what your problem was and to some extent we looked at that and, ah. 

00:47:10
RALPH PACKARD I just kinda feel that in a short period of time that I've been seeing you once a week that, that something may be changing as far as my anger is concerned. It doesn't seem to be so deep when I get angry and I can kind of let go of it a little bit. Ah, ah. 

00:47:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Would you like to talk a little bit more about your anger? Ah, and what, how you can, I mean, I've given you a, all kinds of behavioral things to do but you're talking about maybe understanding your anger or what's causing your anger? 

00:47:40
RALPH PACKARD I don't understand my anger. 

00:47:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:47:45
RALPH PACKARD I don't understand it. 

00:47:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN 'Coz I, one of the things you told me, that your anger is a, it sometimes gets almost to the point of rage and you're- (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

00:47:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - you could, in fact, push though you've never really harmed anybody seriously- (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
RALPH PACKARD No, I haven't harmed anybody seriously. 

00:48:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But there's a potential. But there's a potential there. Uhm. All right, then, then let's, you know, let's explore the anger and rage and maybe we could identify. The way it would help me, and maybe help you is identify when that happens. 

00:48:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What's going, is there something specifically going on that suddenly generates that kind of anger that you can reach out and hurt somebody or hurt yourself? 

00:48:25
RALPH PACKARD  Yeah. 

00:48:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Think about it. 

00:48:30
Search for concreteness. 

00:48:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Give me a specific incident, maybe, if you can think of. 

00:48:35
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think I can give you one incident, ah, that happened, ah, to me, ah, not too long ago. I thought this guy was trying to take advantage of me. And, ah, so I guess I kind of got angry with him, a little bit and kind of told him, you know, what I thought of him and he got, made a mistake and he got angry with me and so, he came out on the short end of it. But I guess people try to take advantage of you and they (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:49:07
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Be more specific about "taking advantage". 

00:49:07
RALPH PACKARD  Well, someone, somebody ah, that won't take "no" for an answer, you know, like somebody wants to try to get you, sell you something and you tell him, "No, I'm not interested." And then, you know, they keep persisting and if you tell them, you know, that what they're trying to say, you wouldn't be caught dead with, anyway, cop an attitude then, ah, and then they get angry. Well, that's, you know, if you're going to go out of your way to provoke somebody and they get angry at them, you've got to expect that, that you're gonna come out on the short end of it. 

00:49:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You know, Ralph, what I wanna know is I've provoked anger in you. What's gotten in the way of that? 'Coz I've done the same thing that guy in the bar room might be doing. 

00:49:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, but, you know, you're on my side. And you're , you know, you're helping me so I don't really view you in that thing, you know, in that way. I mean, I'm kind of very tolerant of what, whatever you say and what you. 

00:50:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But if I tell you, "You can't manipulate me." and I understood what you were doing, we're gonna get back to this because it's very, very important that we understand your rage and your anger. 

00:50:25
RALPH PACKARD I was not trying to manipulate you. 

00:50:30
Relationship strong enough for humor 

00:50:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Take, take that grin off your face. 

00:50:30
RALPH PACKARD I was not trying to manipulate you. I was being honest with you. 

00:50:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ralph, we've been together- 

00:50:35
Norma keeps her position. 

00:50:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - a long time and I can tell when I'm being manipulated. But let's, let's leave this one. 

00:50:40
RALPH PACKARD Okay. 

00:50:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Because that's the way, because I think, let's go back to this one when you see me next week. 'Coz it's it really is getting to the heart of where you're at and what's happening to you. 

00:50:50
RALPH PACKARD All right. I've had enough for a while, anyways. 

00:50:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay. 

00:50:55
Discussion of Second Session 

00:50:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Ah, you know I was fascinated with right there at the very end of that segment where I saw Ralph, ah, kind of taken you off target where I would usually be snookering you a little bit. And I was wondering what was going on with you when he started taking you off the topic is over. 

00:51:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I sought to get him back on the topic, I don't think I consciously thought of him, interesting, snookering me, but, ah, sort of like losing control of, of it was gonna start to wander and, and I had to get it back more focused, ah, and, and, ah, think I made the attempt to say we really gotta get back at, ah, give me some specifics. 

00:51:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. You're smiling, you just say that what was (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:51:53
RALPH PACKARD I knew, I knew exactly where I was going with that and, ah, and, and then I realized that, that after I tried that move, that she was not going to fall for it and was gonna bring me to the center again, which she did. 

00:52:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, in a way we're back to the central thing, in the first themes. 

00:52:10
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

00:52:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY The therapist really has to control the topic, in the broad sense. 

00:52:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN In the broad sense, 'coz it isn't, ah, I think, ah, presents a problem dealing with, in particular, people that are anti-social or had been referred to by the courts, 'coz you are seen, as, as, a power figure and you don't want to be seen as an authorative figure, you wanna be seen as a disciplinary figure that somehow you want a positive picture of yourself and, and that's, ah, a narrow line, whereas I think when you go to a regular counseling you want, you want the therapist to take control and help you. And I think that always bothers me when I get very directive is he going to see me or she going to see me is just one more parole or just one more judge, one more authoritary figure. That is a sense of balance. (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
RALPH PACKARD I think, I think their trying to bonehead move like that on my part, ah, was a kind of maybe a test or to see if our trust level was gonna hold up. (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:53:05
RALPH PACKARD And, and, ah, I think it did. And so that, but I think I'll try that to see if I, ah, you know, if you're gonna turn on me with that one. And, ah, (inaudible ) (crosstalk). 

00:53:22
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But I also think that what you just said is important, that there is that when all this interactions someone whose confrontation, there is a trust level that will keep that relationship together and not alienate. 

00:53:30
RALPH PACKARD Well, I have a stake in it, definitely. 

00:53:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh. 

00:53:35
RALPH PACKARD That's clear. 

00:53:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY And over time, with an honest hold you can start bringing in humor, "Hey there, there off the pole and that again." (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:53:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY What do you think about that? 

00:53:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And they'll, they'll accept that 'coz they're clever enough, you know, all right, I'll get away with this one. 

00:53:45
RALPH PACKARD You caught me. Yeah.(laughs) 

00:53:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY (laughs) That happens. 

00:53:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:53:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Again, I saw, ah, one thing I want to ask was, some of the stuff you're saying kinda heads toward issues in anger management. Would you do anger management yourself or would you refer out anger management? Or, would that be a part of the whole treatment process? 

00:54:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I think that if we were in a regular treatment, it should be part of the treatment process. It was here that we're really sort of more focusing on the communication and not on setting any kind of a, ah, therapeutic process, but I certainly think anger management would be in there just to some extent where I'm giving directives. And we are, you know, sort of applying some cognitive material, but absolutely, anger management would have been very important. 

00:54:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY I think one part of anger management is learning how to, helping, Ralph, for example, to get in touch with his feelings or recognize that before he gets verwhelmed. 

00:54:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Very good. 

00:54:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY I saw that behind where you were heading. 

00:54:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  But, and, and that is certainly and I think that is where I got to rage, I was trying to get to that point where he then, and in some sense, maybe why he maneuvered me off that. 

00:54:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY And these are very scary topics for counselors because we're, we're, we're nicy-nice sometimes and don't really want to deal with anger. It's, it's a topic where I think counselors and therapists are often quite uncomfortable. 

00:55:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I think, you bringing up a point that if you read any of the literature, one of the things they're saying is that, everybody can counsel these clients. Because that may be putting them into a very uncomfortable position not really how they see them. And so you got to be able to almost put on the boxing gloves with them. 

00:55:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY And the thing is that ah, if you talk about the manhood issue, I'm sitting counseling you and, ah, I get a little fluffed, there's a chance for you to prove your manhood over me. I've that happened to me, ah, with, ah, anti-social acting outside of the class. 

00:55:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Sure. Yeah. 

00:55:35
RALPH PACKARD That's true. 

00:55:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY They end up getting in charge of the session. 

00:55:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

00:55:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ) there's no session. 

00:55:43
RALPH PACKARD And also if a counselor becomes concerned about, ah, losing control of the person they're counseling, and then they retreat to trying to be, ah, very academic with the person, that can really piss somebody off. 

00:56:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN (laughs) 

00:56:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Really? 

00:56:05
RALPH PACKARD Yes. I know it could me. It could really irritate me. But the fact that she, she talks somewhat on the same level I am, when the talk is a cushion where if there was the supremacy conversation up here coming down. I don't think that I would do well with a person like that. 

00:56:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Special observations you have from the session, your objectives and how well you affect your achievement? 

00:56:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, ah, I think it went well. I've felt to some extent that I didn't have quite the handle that I would like to have on my client and, and maybe that was good, I don't know. Ah, but that was sometimes I get focused on my objective and somehow he was able to sort of take me off course and that, ah, allowing that to happen was important, but it did, ah, create some anxiety in me like, you know, how is this gonna work out? 

00:57:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And always hanging over am I gonna lose him? Am I gonna lose the rapport. 

00:57:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY That's always possible. (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's always, in this type of relationship, am I gonna lose the rapport. 

00:57:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY And, ah, Ralph, what about you? What are some of your reflections? 

00:57:20
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think that, that the ability to be able to be on that common ground and, and discuss some of these issues without reducing them to terms, which are unacceptable, ah, gives you if there is any wiggle room in a person that functions in a way that I'm trying to act, ah, it gives you a chance maybe to say maybe, you know, I can change my behavior, I can always try, ah, and it's not threatening in that, that way. It's, it's something that you maybe after awhile begin to think as doable. So, I think I could do this. 

00:58:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. I found that when an anti-social client gets a little off-track with me, or better, I better say I'm off-track because they've got me off-track, going back to what are our, what are our joint objectives? 

00:58:20
RALPH PACKARD She did that, one time- (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:58:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah, I find it. 

00:58:20
RALPH PACKARD - which helped. Yeah. 

00:58:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY It helps you keep focused. You kind of agreed you want to keep you out in jail. 

00:58:25
RALPH PACKARD (inaudible ) 

00:58:29
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. That's, there is, there is a common goal and I share that same common goal with you. 

00:58:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Let's return to that base. I think that's really critical. 

00:58:35
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. When I said to her, you know, we got a, I got a stake in this and you have too, you know, it, I guess I kinda meant that when I said it. (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
RALPH PACKARD That you know, there was something for me and there's something for her. 

00:58:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY That she is to keep her job. 

00:58:50
RALPH PACKARD Your job, her pay. 

00:58:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:58:55
RALPH PACKARD And, ah, you know, and I want her to write a good report. That was the only thing I'm saying, you know. 

00:59:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY You do have a good joint goal. So what do we look for in this third session. Where are we going to be? 

00:59:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think the third session is we're coming to some finality. I'm gonna try to give some directives because I think it will help him in his return to society. I don't think we're getting too much interpretation. Maybe we're trying to get him to, to be looked of someone of his behavior and how it's changed but bringing some closure to what's going on and allowing him to be comfortable in coming back. 

00:59:35
Closing Session Five Months Later Client's and counselor's goals met Exploration of other issues Client encouraged to maintain therapeutic alliance for the future 

00:59:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, Ralph, we're coming down to really the end of, end of almost having fulfilled what the judge's expectations were. Those are couple of things I'd like to talk about. One, did you ever end up, two things, one, about how you feel about the boxing in gymnasium. And then we never really talked about what's happened with you and your wife. And so, I'd like to really deal with those two things before we bring closure to this. 

01:00:20
RALPH PACKARD Well, I did go to- 

01:00:20
Ralph has new outlets for anger 

01:00:20
RALPH PACKARD - the gym and I spend a few weeks at the gym. And as you know, it was okay but, ah, I realized that maybe that wasn't the answer either. So I look for other things. And one thing I'd found was when I was at the gym they had a pool, then I started swimming a little bit and I got very interested in that. And I swim now, ah, two or three times a week. 

01:00:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

01:00:50
RALPH PACKARD And I like it. It drains energy from you while you're doing it in a very strange way, but when you rejuvenate, you kinda feel relaxed. I'm enjoying it. 

01:01:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. Good. 

01:01:05
RALPH PACKARD So, I think I'm gonna probably keep that up. Boxing, I don't think I'm gonna follow up on that much anymore. (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. That, that sounds excellent. 

01:01:10
RALPH PACKARD And I've also started jogging a little bit more. That came out of boxing but I started running and I don't think I'm going to give the running up. I want to keep running . And I'm gonna look for other things to do, from a physical fitness point of view which might help, I don't know what they are now but I got a couple of swimming and jogging. And I want to keep those up you know. Maybe I had some other things to do. 

01:01:40
Reflection of feeling 

01:01:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Sounds like you feel good about yourself. 

01:01:40
RALPH PACKARD I feel better since I've been doing all of these things. Yeah. 

01:01:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'm sure that that's gonna be interesting in the report. Then let's move on to more personal things because we haven't really discuss very much, ah, what's happened to your own personal relationship. 

01:01:55
RALPH PACKARD My wife, you know, came back and we've ah, been together now for some time and we're trying not to keep a record. We're just trying to go day by day and we're getting along a little better than what we have and we decided if we get to near the point where we get angry to each other, we stop and kinda cool down and walk away for a while, then come back and pick up again where we left it up and try to talk about it in a more, you know, congenial manner. It seems to be working. We we're getting along much better and I think that I've realized that I can control some of my anger by doing that. 

01:02:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  By walking away. (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
Ralph gains insight 

01:02:50
RALPH PACKARD By walking away a little bit and thinking about what happened and not being, always maybe not blaming the other person. Well, maybe I kind of something to do with it. I accept that. It seems to work a little. 

01:03:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN But it seems to me you've also helped her because that she's also kind of control her anger. It's just not one way street for you. 

01:03:15
RALPH PACKARD  Well, you know, she hasn't thrown any food at me lately. So, I think we're getting along much better and much more peaceful. 

01:03:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Do you think you helped her somewhat in that? 

01:03:25
RALPH PACKARD I don't know. I'm just glad that this happen. It feels good. It's much better than being angry all the time. 

01:03:40
Self-control defined as manhood 

01:03:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's interesting because- 

01:03:40
Self-control defined as manhood 

01:03:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - one thing that often happen is if one person changes their behavior which is also you're doing, it helps that other person and changes their behavior, unknowingly, not because you've done anything. But you've influenced her in a way that has helped her. And so in some sense you're, by learning to control your behavior, you have helped her. And that should make you feel good about yourself and your manhood. 

01:04:05
RALPH PACKARD  Yes, definitely. 

01:04:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And it's going well with her and with kids. Is it working or is that? 

01:04:15
RALPH PACKARD Oh, yeah. The kids are great. You know, we both get along better, with the kids doing well. So it's worked out. I don't want to say too much about it. 

01:04:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You don't talk too much about it? 

01:04:30
RALPH PACKARD No, because it's going so well and you know, I'm just happy that I don't know what caused it or how it happened but it's happening. 

01:04:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  For the relationship or because of what's happening the change in you? 

01:04:45
RALPH PACKARD I know the change in me. I don't know. Tomorrow I could lose my temper and hit somebody. 

01:04:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Let's not walk the bones of what you say. 

01:04:50
RALPH PACKARD I'm willing to keep going like this and just see how it works out. And I'm trying to do that and I'm looking forward to getting back to court. And ah. 

01:05:05
Here and now confrontation 

01:05:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN (laughs) I'm tempted to ask you because I know how good you are. Do you think you're manipulating me right now or you think this is for real? 

01:05:10
RALPH PACKARD No, this is for real. I'm very pleased with what both of us have done. I think it's worked well for me. 

01:05:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'm pleased in seeing some of these benefits. I guess what I wanna do, I don't want to put a cold blanket or anything is that, I want you to remember what it was like, and I want you find yourself loosing it or what you think about be able to pull back. Hold yourself accountable and think through what that has meant to you. I think that if we have more time, and that's something you want you think about because getting rid of anger and how to manage anger is not always that easy. Maybe it's been not that difficult 'coz we have the opportunity to talk. But maybe at some point you may think that you need to explore a little bit more how to manage your anger more effectively. 

01:06:15
RALPH PACKARD I'd be willing to deal with that after being straightened out with the court. And ah, if it comes out the way I think it's gonna come out, then I would be probably interested in doing something in that area. 

01:06:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I hope so. And I hope that maybe you can come back here. We can do that but I feel quite comfortable in writing my report to the judge and I won't go into detail of what we said but, simply that I think that you have learned, that you have made every effort and utterly to continue making (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
RALPH PACKARD Make him quit telling I am not a threat to society. 

01:07:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You don't want to be seen as another threat to society. Okay. You want that in? I got worse to say, but you're not a threat to anybody in a barroom anymore. 

01:07:10
RALPH PACKARD I hope not. 

01:07:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Are you still going to barrooms? 

01:07:15
RALPH PACKARD No. 

01:07:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No. Oh, I see we eliminate that also. 

01:07:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, it's not a good place for me to ah,- (crosstalk) 

01:07:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, that's a very. 

01:07:20
RALPH PACKARD - to control anger, I guess. 

01:07:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, but I would say that that's a major accomplishment on your part. To recognize that that environment, 'cause we talked about environment before, was not a healthy one for you, and that there was no point in putting yourself in that potential. 

01:07:35
RALPH PACKARD I would like to think of it as just maybe its a place that, ah, it's not in my best interest. 

01:07:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's good. 

01:07:45
RALPH PACKARD Ah, more of, you know, there's not too many people in the swimming pool that would argue or start a fight with you when you're there swimming laps. I mean their pretty, pretty occupied with what they're doing. The same way with jogging, you meet a jogger, you talk to him, if you're not out of breath but, ah, you know, nobody's interested in you and start trouble with you. (crosstalk) 

01:08:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

01:08:05
RALPH PACKARD it is. I think it's got something to do with environment. 

01:08:05
Modicum of change for the anti-social client Rewarding experience for the counselor 

01:08:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And I wanna encourage you and I want give you credit for being able on your own to understand that a barroom may just be an area that you are not gonna put yourself into a position that could possibly get you in trouble. That that's, that is a very, I think, a manly thing to do. It's an acknowledgment of something about yourself. And not in some ways that, you know, I'm not gonna be able to change that. And so I think you ought to, well, I guess what I'm trying encourage you is feel good about yourself. Good about what you changed in your own behavior. 

01:08:50
RALPH PACKARD Uh hmm. 

01:08:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And that only you did. It wasn't anything that I did or the judge did. Ultimately, you have to take responsibility and I want you to feel good about the fact that you've been able to take responsibility for your behavior, and say, look, I dont want that behavior to get me. I wanna be able to live my life without having to be threatened by the courts or by anybody else. And that you did that. 

01:09:10
RALPH PACKARD  Okay. 

01:09:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And are we almost through? 

01:09:20
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

01:09:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're finished? 

01:09:20
RALPH PACKARD  Right. 

01:09:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Goodbye. 

01:09:25
RALPH PACKARD Goodbye. 

01:09:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And if you need me again? 

01:09:30
RALPH PACKARD Call. 

01:09:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Call. 

01:09:30
Discussion of Closing Sessions 

01:09:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY  And, so we have a happy ending. Ah, as ah, have I had experience with these type of clients, I'm wondering, is it really that easy? 

01:09:50
RALPH PACKARD (laughs) 

01:09:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN No, I think we accelerated this and it's not that easy. But, it can, to some degree, there's a certain amount of modicum of change in behavior that can allow the anti-social personality to live in a life which is, doesn't require his going to prison or jail, and that he's still gonna have his fights, but in some control over behavior. And the other thing, of course, is simply age. That as you mature,they just get too tired of doing that sort of thing. 

01:10:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY One thing that I really heard was a consistent message of, he wants to have his manhood, he wants to have his strength, and in the progress of this therapy, he's still got his manhood, still got his strength, he's got new ways to identify- (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:10:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY - that strength. Is that right? 

01:10:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. And that he should take credit for that. I feel I wanted him to take credit for his, his change in his behavior. 

01:10:45
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

01:10:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And not give it to somebody else; that that was part of his strength. 

01:10:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And then he can change his behavior if he has to. 

01:10:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, we're really kinda back to that working alliances. That he's got his goals. You got your goals. And we really needed to stay on the same track the whole way through, and to get off track, you're gonna be in trouble. 

01:11:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think that the issue in doing a tape like this is we really couldn't get into any of the therapeutic aspects. I, I would start thinking that, we touch on his manhood simply to believe that in manhood you have to be able to fight and I think they had like a cognitive kind of interaction many talked about his beliefs in manhood, what it requires, what it is to be a man. (crosstalk) 

01:11:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:11:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And it, it certainly the fact that he moved from, going to the boxing ring, which is a violent kind of thing, to something like swimming, something like jogging, was more like changing his belief system. But I just felt that we were not, it was very tempting to start going to a therapeutic alliance. Because I think that it was important that you shifted from boxing to jogging, to swimming, which really wasn't a violent sport anymore. And that your change, your belief for what makes a man will be interchanged. 

01:12:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY And just physically, the whole business what happens in the body with the exercise is similar to what's happening in the body, rather than external drugs and controlling what happens, ah, his controlling producing his own endorphins and the serotonins, and all those good things. 

01:12:20
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

01:12:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I think that probably, you know, in terms of behavioral, like the anger management and so forth, that that is sort of the goal, where are you gonna go? And once you could breakthrough and establish the relationship, you can then begin to look at some, what is the best therapeutic process to make you change. And we really didn't get into that, ah, with what we are doing. 

01:12:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY And that sounds fun. If you do the anger management, we kinda go through a standard anger management program, viewed in the cognitive change or start looking at Eronbech(ph) and Ellis(ph),- (crosstalk) 

01:12:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

01:12:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY - and you would follow those standard programs pretty much the same. 

01:13:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

01:13:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY But, the purpose of that is not necessarily self- actualization. The purpose of that is stay on that original track of how are you gonna stay out of jail- (crosstalk) 

01:13:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. Right. 

01:13:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ) why am I bothering with all these stuff. 

01:13:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

01:13:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY You will always have to stay on that track. One thing that I'm just curious about is the question, ah, from your experience with a lot of these types, what role did medication have with patients such as these. 

01:13:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I think that, basically medication has not been, other than with borderline, medication is not been terribly satisfactory. Well, if you get the schizoid and so forth,- (crosstalk) 

01:13:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:35
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - you may put some medication but generally that's not, that's not been, ah, other problem. And with an anti- social, I mean they fight off the anxiety and depression. We really didn't get into those feelings, but they really are more concerned solving their problem. And if they solve their problem and somehow they push the anxiety, the depression away. 

01:14:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Do you think that there's a need for medic, does depression become a factor for sometime? 

01:14:00
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I dont think that they get, you know, if you get into ah, it could serve interesting(ph) sort of that we did more which total rejecting now, just like a psychoanalytical approach. Uhm. That there is sometimes, if you get, I'm thinking of severe cases where this young man have killed three children. And when we got him to deal with that and really be coming in touch with, now developing a sense of guilt, developing a sense of empathy, he hung himself. And one of the things, is that empathy is a hard for anti-social because they don't experience empathy. I mean they're the focus but if do get some of this committed severe crime. Ah, then you run the risk, a joke always been, if we can make them neurotic we make them healthy. 

01:14:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY I know. It's kinda like a great strength. I was like any(ph) part of the strength and these various personalities that I know. The great strengths of the anti- social is they're energetic and in some ways their fun and they're interesting, and what we can do with is that, is that some of, some of the stuff it came out of this is that we work with this energy, we- (crosstalk) 

01:15:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

01:15:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY - work for stuff that was fun and, ah, he maintained his interest. 

01:15:20
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, and, if you think about, some of the very successful businessmen in this world have certain characteristics. It's not the, the pervasive one, I mean, that's the difference between maybe of what we call an anti-socialist dealing with the law constantly- (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Right. 

01:15:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - but they have certain characteristics (inaudible ) characteristics that and. 

01:15:42
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Ah, certainly there are some very prominent people in business and politics that engage in a lot of those very same type of behavior. (crosstalk) 

01:15:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

01:15:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY They may not be getting in fights, but they are very much taking care of their needs in manipulating. 

01:15:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's right. 

01:15:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY And the strategies you've (inaudible ) with the therapeutic alliance was just the same. We're working with a Narcissistic person working in Wall Street. A lot of the same strategies are really important. 

01:16:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. 

01:16:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY (inaudible ) 'coz they're gonna try and get you just off topic just as much as Ralph might. 

01:16:10
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, but it's, ah, as I said this, this was only a demonstration, maybe more on the focus on the counselor and what helps them in an environment rather than the, the therapeutic ah, whether Ralph would have changed or- (crosstalk) 

01:16:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - but that would require I think a more of focusing on some kind of therapeutic process whether it be anger management, cognitive behavior or even Glass'(ph) work. We were really focusing on the communication. 

01:16:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah, and what, what I get out of this, what would I take home from this is kinda like I knew before from experience was clarified for me is the real need for the therapist- counselor-interviewer to maintain control of the topic. But you kinda broaden that with kind, I can go and make con, control of the topic if there's room for the client, for the patient, for the inmate and that's where you get your alliance. It is basically out of joint. It's a different way to go about therapeutic alliance, that's a powerful- (crosstalk) 

01:17:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:17:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY - learning for me. 

01:17:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, and to some extent I think that, that cognitive behavior and so forth that the therapist is taking for their own sake. There, there are certain directives, there's some things that you gonna have to do if we're going to continue now. I may not- (crosstalk) 

01:17:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Right. 

01:17:25
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - of all the ten directives I give you. You may only take two but you gonna begin to learn to do that. So, if you think about the therapeutic processes that were being use now with these types of individuals. It is that the, ah, the therapist is taking more and more control. 

01:17:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. That's, that's a big message for a, for people that we're, want the client to take control but the therapist remains in charge. What, what are your thoughts on that Ralph? 

01:17:50
RALPH PACKARD Well I, I found myself, ah, getting caught up in the role a little bit and it's kind of a relief to be able to say, I've done some other things besides going around barrooms punching somebody. (crosstalk) 

01:18:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:18:05
RALPH PACKARD Ah, getting into difficulty but, ah, it was almost like a great sense of relief to be able to do that. And I just wonder if maybe easy. People really enjoy that one it happens. They, they change their behavior a little bit. (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's interesting. 

01:18:30
RALPH PACKARD Start thinking a little different looking for other alternatives to, to respond to the kinder and gentler society out there and that maybe it's helpful to them and they learn how to, to deal with those issues but in a better way than they, they have before. It, it was not fun to me to, to keep talking the way I was talking about those things. So, when I got around to bring this into closure, from my stand point it was kinda like, ah, exhausting, a big breath and saying "Wow you know this great to get out of this," and I, I guess that I've never dealt with that before. 

01:19:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY A new way, a new way to reach all objectives you're reminding of the- (crosstalk) 

01:19:15
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

01:19:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY - when I was working with and he was an inpatient at the Veterans Hospital. And he was there because, he was manager of a fastfood chain and one way of dealing with his employees was, was to womp(ph) 'em. Finally he had hit enough that they send him off to the hospital. 

01:19:30
RALPH PACKARD (laughs) Yeah. 

01:19:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY And as, as I talked to him "What do, what do you wanna accomplish?" and he says "Well I really wanted to do is to control and manipulate people." And I said, "Okay, great." And the teacher (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:19:43
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN (inaudible ) 

01:19:44
DR. ALLEN IVEY One thing of a way to control and manipulate is just to start to listening to them, find out what they want so I ended up teaching some of these, of these micro skill of listening and he was happy as a clam. He can still control but- (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

01:19:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY - in the process of that of course so you just like you is gonna get new ways of achieving his objectives of feeling good about himself. 

01:20:00
RALPH PACKARD Well, it reminds me of a story that my grandfather told me years and years ago when I was very young. This is a true story. I came home one afternoon and I've been in a fight in school and I'd not fractured one of my knuckles but I had severely bruised it and took the skin off, two or three others, and he asked me why I was looking like a little down with the tooth and so I told him I said "I got into a fight in school." And he said " Really? How many, do you usually get into fights in school?" and I said "Well, once in a while." He says "Give me your hands." He took my hands he said "Wow." He said " That one don't look too good there." He said "The skin is gone off on this one." He says "Do you realize if you hit somebody at least once a week, what you're knuckles gonna look like in ten years?" 

01:20:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY (laughs) 

01:20:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN (laughs) 

01:20:50
RALPH PACKARD And I kind of, kind of- 

01:20:55
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Great memory. 

01:20:55
RALPH PACKARD - remember what the, yeah you're right you can't punch your way through, through life. That was a very, ah, I always remember that. I always remember the story. 

01:21:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's very, one of the issues I think I like to raise is that for, for the counselor, can we take, tolerate these kinds of persons? Is it so in conflict with what our values are. There's also an interesting thing that I think counselors have is that vicarious thrill. That here sits somebody who can defy the social life and do the things that they may fantasize doing and having no constraints. Now the counselor also ultimately knows what they can get them into but there is a certain amount of voyeurism in people that are working with the anti-social. The person that, that ignores the social standards. (crosstalk) 

01:21:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY They would like to toss it about. 

01:21:50
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. It's, it's almost like hot. It sounds like fun. And fortunately for us we also understand that that's, the other end is that I had a case setting whose somebody who could go to jail but there is that kind of, of almost enjoying their behavior- (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:05
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN - because we can never be able to behave like that. 

01:22:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Final words from either of you. 

01:22:15
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I hope that, ah, for any of the counselors that maybe watching this set, its been helpful. I'm sure we've left a great deal unsaid and clearly this was not your typical client though I think he played the role very well. But I think we did identify the kinds of issues that you as a counselor face as you go in because there's more and more, ah, studies being done with at-risk youth, more and more what they call re-entry programs that you were gonna face, and more and more family violence. And so these clients are not, they are gonna be sent to you and I, I hope that in some ways we helped out for you to look at these in a slightly different perspective. 

01:23:00
RALPH PACKARD Well, all I can say is that it's a very difficult playing a role like that. Ah, and like I said it was a tremendous relief to, to bring it to an end and say, you know, I've made some changes in my behavior. But, I just, it's, it's not it must not be, ah, pleasant to be really in that kind of circumstances and believe that, so it's a, it's a good thing if someone can (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:23:32
DR. ALLEN IVEY That's interesting. In, in a paradox, the desire for freedom and do whatever they want boom. They're trapped and capsulated almost more than anybody else. (crosstalk) 

01:23:40
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN True. They can't deal with their anxiety, they can't deal with their frustrations, so they are encapsulated. (crosstalk) 

01:23:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY So we can- (crosstalk) 

01:23:45
DR. NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think it's very interesting. 

01:23:45
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. 

01:23:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY - liberate them and in fact we can end by saying we can liberate them by an effective therapeutic alliance. 

01:23:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, I can see it would take some time. 

01:23:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah, it's an uneasy task. 

01:23:50
RALPH PACKARD But it's, it's something probably doable, you know.
