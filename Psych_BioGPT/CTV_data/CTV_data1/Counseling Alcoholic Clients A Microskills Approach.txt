00:00:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Okay, Chris. What, ah, what bring you here again today? 

00:00:20
CHRIS  I'm looking for some help to, ah, treat my alcoholism. 

00:00:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Again? 

00:00:30
CHRIS Again. Continuously, yes. 

00:00:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay. Let's, let's talk about a little bit. Really, I, I don't know that you're still smoking. 

00:00:40
CHRIS Yeah. 

00:00:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah, okay. What happened, 'coz you're here. Tell me a little bit more about what happened. 

00:00:45
CHRIS Nothing's happened. I'm just feeling very frustrated and depressed all the time. 

00:00:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah, I know what you mean. I was, did you, did you have the same problem I had getting over. You're talking about being frustrated and depressed. It took me an extra half hour to get here today because of that damn tie-up on 495. I think that if they don't do something about the traffic, some, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:01:05
CHRIS I don't come that way. I don't know what you're talking about. 

00:01:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, it's just I was trying to say I understand about frustration and so forth. So, could you tell me a little bit more about, ah, the, you know, your, your frustration and things like that. Tell me a little bit more. (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
CHRIS I don't know about it. I don't understand why it's going on. 

00:01:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well (sigh). Oh, well, I'll try to help you with that. Ah, maybe tell me what, what was the last time you got frustrated about, what you got frustrated about. Just sort of tell me, and I can maybe kind of key in on that. 

00:01:35
CHRIS Well, you know, I don't have a car or a phone or anything like that. And it's a matter of getting to AA meetings is very frustrating to me depending on other people. 

00:01:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Yeah. Well, ah, have you thought of maybe, uhm, I mean, you can borrow a car or something like that. 

00:01:50
CHRIS I don't have a driver's license. 

00:01:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  But, you've got problems. 

00:01:55
CHRIS I've. 

00:01:55
Attending 

00:01:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Chris, what brings you here today? 

00:02:05
CHRIS I'm in, I'm just sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

00:02:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Could you tell me a little bit more what you mean by that? 

00:02:10
CHRIS Well, in general, I've been on drugs or booze since I was 14 years old. That's 11 years. It's getting to the point where it's dominating my life. And I'm tired of it. 

00:02:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Just fed up. 

00:02:25
CHRIS Fed up, very fed up. I have to sit there and, ah, before I face work, I'm so sick or anything. I have to take a bottle and drink or some pills. 

00:02:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Pills and a bottle. 

00:02:40
CHRIS Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Tell me a little bit more so I can, I'll just sort of get a better feeling for you, if you would. 

00:02:45
CHRIS Well, my parents are getting down on me. 

00:02:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
CHRIS I have a son that I've left with my parents. It's been, ah, two years, trying to get myself together in those two years. It's not working. I'm missing up on my employment. 

00:03:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Well, it sounds that you've got something, some really heavy things to deal with. 

00:03:10
CHRIS I do. I do. And I really don't know how to go about it. My father died about two and a half years ago from addiction. 

00:03:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
CHRIS Ah, we found out, accidentally, six weeks later. 

00:03:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
CHRIS He's buried in Nebraska. We don't know anything about that or really how he died. 

00:03:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
CHRIS Those things are bothering me to a point where I can't control it anymore. 

00:03:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah, it really sounds like you've got the situation out of your father which has probably came as a shock to you, situation with your child, ah, work. Everything seems to be just coming in on you. 

00:03:45
CHRIS It is. Completely. And, uhm, that's why I'm reaching for, uhm, some beer really. I'm not much of the hard liquor drinker. 

00:03:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. You're reaching for what? I didn't(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
CHRIS Beer. 

00:03:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Beer. 

00:03:55
CHRIS Beer. 

00:03:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Ah, okay. So you're saying that beer is what you now mean. 

00:04:00
CHRIS Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. It's, it's the thing that you're going after. 

00:04:00
CHRIS As opposed to drugs. I started out with drugs. 

00:04:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay. And now, you're into, into more into alcohol... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
CHRIS Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...abuse which is beer that you're talking about. Ah, I'd like to still hear a little bit more before I try to kinda key in some of the, maybe, maybe key in some problems that you might be having, that you wanna really talk about. 

00:04:20
CHRIS Well, I think I was very close to my father. And that is... (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:04:20
CHRIS ...something really that has really, really bothered me. He told me when I was seven years old that he was in love with another woman. And then, of course, my parents did get divorced. And there has been a lot of, uhm, feeling towards that, the separation and everything. 

00:04:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay. So, it's been, it's, it's the pain of your father's. 

00:04:40
CHRIS I think so if it has to be any one thing, and then it's everything and anything. 

00:04:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Okay. Now, you, con, con, continue talking. 

00:04:50
CHRIS I, I just, I get to a point where I get completely desperate, just completely desperate. I don't know which way to turn. 

00:05:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. All right, since that divorce then, and ever since that divorce, the desperation. 

00:05:05
CHRIS But I don't know. 

00:05:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:05:10
CHRIS My mother just sits there and says, "Forget it. You know, I've had enough of your questions." She's lived through addiction with my father. She's lived through the addiction with my brother and now me. 

00:05:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, you're saying your whole family's had this. 

00:05:20
CHRIS Oh, yeah. 

00:05:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  That's, that's a real concern. 

00:05:25
CHRIS Ah, yeah. And I just don't know where to turn. 

00:05:30
Paraphrasing 

00:05:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Bill, what can I do for you today? 

00:05:40
BILL Well, it's, ah, getting that kinda, I've got to get back into the job market and, ah, and I'm rather concerned my potential of getting a job even when alone. 

00:05:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, why don't you just, you know, fill out your application and walk into the employer's office. That shouldn't be too difficult for you. 

00:06:00
BILL That has been done on several occasions and, ah, so far nothing. Also I guess I got... (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
BILL ...feedback from several other people in the like situations and it's not good. 

00:06:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Uh hmm, I think you're, ah, you know, listening to other people's advice too much. I think if you just, you know just sort of sit up, get yourself dressed and go in, it shouldn't be too much difficult, too difficult for you. 

00:06:25
BILL I don't know. I, ah, really present a problem perhaps in getting what I wouldn't like or think I can do and what the employers feel because of certain situations. 

00:06:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, yeah, we all have to make compromises and you might not be able to get both ends the way you want them. 

00:06:40
BILL  Well, and the compromise, ah, you know, money wise, ah, is, is fine. It doesn't require that much but, ah, training-wise, I can't very easily shift fields because, again, if the employer look at it. 

00:07:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Oh, well, again, you know you just have to kinda do, deal with some of those realities and do the best you can with it. That's, that's what... (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
BILL  Uh-huh. 

00:07:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. I hear you say. (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
BILL I think that, that, that is my original approach. And I, I, I like that. But it also reaches a point where you have to do something. 

00:07:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, you know, you can't have everything your own way. 

00:07:20
Paraphrasing 2 

00:07:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Bill, if I recall, the last time you were here you were talking about seeking a job. How's it been going? 

00:07:35
BILL Not so good. Ah, the market, they say, is not so good right now. But that, really, I don't think is the main concern. I, I believe I'm qualified in the certain areas to convince some employers of this because of my past track record, my eight or nine months of unemployment. And, ah, of course, the reasons that I became unemployed, was my age is not too good of a record right now, you know. 

00:08:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. What I hear you're saying is there is a lot of blockages and even finding employment about little(ph) employment that you want. 

00:08:10
BILL Right. Ah, you know even, even on the basic job, there are certain physical things that I, I, I obviously can't do, ah, right now. But even to attempt to get a, a low paying job, I mean, I'm overqualified, okay, because of what I was doing before or even within my own field at a, ah, lower level. 

00:08:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, there's a real bargaining that's going on between your past history plus your fact that you're overqualified. You're concerned, that you're not going to be able to find something. 

00:08:40
BILL Right. And, ah, you know I, I try and understand the employer's viewpoint of this. And, ah, ah, I realize I was responsible for the reasons that, ah, I'm unemployed now. But I still have a basic need of getting employment. 

00:08:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, you're feeling that the employers are still pretty unreasonable and, ah, in fact, ah, I love to hear you're saying is that they're, they probably don't have a broad enough perspective on things and put people like yourself. 

00:09:10
BILL Well, ah, alcoholism per se, ah, I know from my last company and everything and, ah, from talking to several other people, ah, they're still not widely understood in a lot of industrial situations. And they feel they're taking a serious change perhaps. 

00:09:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, another thing that I hear you saying is that, and in spite of the fact that you feel that you've solved your alcohol problem, employers don't seem to understand that. And that's causing a lot of problems for you right now. 

00:09:35
BILL  That, and, you know, even, even the fact that, ah, what do I tell an employer about this gap in my employment history? Ah, do I say because of alcoholism or lie about it? 

00:09:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay so, another issue is, ah, how do you handle this particular time in your life so that it doesn't get in your way of getting another job. 

00:10:00
BILL  And right. You know, I, I, I, I have a need to be honest. But you know as I say, it, it really turns a lot of employers, well, everybody is still far off. 

00:10:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, being honest isn't gonna pay off. 

00:10:15
BILL No, but, ah, you know, there are other features even without that. That gap is still there. My age is still there. I can't lie about my age. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah. 

00:10:25
BILL And my past track record and employment are still there. That, those are facts. 

00:10:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, there's a real, almost a fear of whether you can overcome these obstacles. And if you don't overcome these obstacles, if I can add something else, then what's gonna happen to you? 

00:10:40
BILL And, well, that presents a problem too. Of course, you know, as I've said I've been unemployed for, ah, eight or nine months now. And I had no benefits coming in. My resources are running very low. 

00:10:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, you're really feeling crunch right now. 

00:10:55
BILL Ah, right. Ah, I get letters from home saying that they will help. But, obviously, they can't support me and themselves. And, ah, and, and I don't want this either. I, I want to support myself. 

00:11:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. You don't wanna become a burden again to them, or to anyone right now. You really want... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
BILL You're right, right. 

00:11:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...to stand on your own two feet. 

00:11:15
BILL Right. And, you know, I, I feel what I have done over the last several months although not getting paid for it but, ah, I, I just know that I'm capable of going back out and doing a good job, perhaps, not at the, the level I was at, but at another level. But that's so difficult because overqualified. 

00:11:35
Reflection of Feeling 1 

00:11:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  How are you feeling today, Sandi? 

00:11:45
SANDI Well, I'm not too great. I'm tired of, wise people call themselves Counselors. I had quite a time at the school with the school counselor about my son... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Hhmm. 

00:12:00
SANDI ...in the seventh grade. And he's having a lot of problems over at the school. And they call me in for one of these conferences, you know. Oh, it really ticked me off. And, uhm, I'm not just going to take the blame for it. It's not my responsibility. They looked through his records and, trying to figure out why he was having his problem and, all the way from grade school comes this report. There's alcoholism in his family. And the Counselor said, "I see there's alcoholism in the family." And I said, "You're looking at it." 

00:12:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well it sounds to me like you're overreacting. 

00:12:40
SANDI No. It was a, it was a stupid thing, stupid thing he did, trying to find a reason for this kid's behavior outside the school system. He didn't have those kinda troubles when I was drinking. He's just having troubles 'coz he's a teenager. 

00:12:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Aren't you being silly, kind of be, being so irritable about the whole thing. 

00:13:00
SANDI I'm annoyed. I'm not being silly. I'm annoyed at the way they love to dump the problems they're having over at the school on me and they see a thing like alcoholism. And they say, "Uh-huh." It's, ah, stupid. 

00:13:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, you know, you'll certainly learn how to handle these things a little better, it seems to me. 

00:13:20
SANDI It's really annoying because I'm not gonna buy into that. 

00:13:20
Reflection of Feeling 2 

00:13:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  How are you feeling today, Sandi? 

00:13:35
SANDI I'm kind of uptight. My, ah, my mother is coming for a visit. And that's a really heavy trip for me. 

00:13:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. I can really sense that. I just watching this. 

00:13:50
SANDI Yeah. Uhm, I don't know why but it just starts up all kinds of things in me. You know, I love her and everything. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
SANDI  Yeah. I like to see her. I miss her. But she really gets me going as far as going about. 

00:14:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. I sense a feeling of ambivalence about her coming. 

00:14:10
SANDI  Oh, I keep thinking I'm doing okay, and I'm really working hard... (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
SANDI And getting my stuff together and, and I feel okay. And then I think, "What would mother think, you know, when she gets up here?" Uhm, it really upsets me that I am still dependent on how she feels about me. 

00:14:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Dependent, I, I sense a little threatened. 

00:14:30
SANDI  (laughs) Ah, I guess, it's a funny feeling like I still have pigtails. 

00:14:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. A feeling of being a little girl. 

00:14:40
SANDI Uh hmm. And I am trying to work on being independent now, and you know, and she brings out all my old dependencies. And I'd like to have a relationship with her and the here and now... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
SANDI ...today. 

00:14:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
SANDI But I can't get over this. All the old stuff comes back. 

00:14:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  You have a feeling that you need to feel strong. And then when she's here, you don't feel strong. 

00:15:05
SANDI Yeah. A little bit. I, I feel that way. It's, uhm, it's hard to show her that I've changed. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Yes. 

00:15:20
SANDI It's hard for her to see it. 

00:15:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. And so, another thing, I hear you is that you are feeling that you, you wanna, you feel proud of yourself and you want her to feel that kind of pride in you. 

00:15:30
SANDI Yeah. I know I let her down a lot, you know, and disappointed her. Yeah. I'm, I mean, when I first went in for alcohol treatment several years ago, and I called her up and asked her for help financially. And her first remark to me was, "I didn't bring you up to be this way." And so, we started from that. And we've come a long way together on the phone and stuff and she does seem to understand a little but I really get scared when she comes to visit. 

00:15:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, you're, you're feeling that she doesn't still understand but, but not quite, ah, maybe she doesn't really believe that you've come the way you are at right now. 

00:16:00
SANDI Yeah. I don't know if she sees me today. 

00:16:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. What do you mean you don't know if she sees you today? 

00:16:05
SANDI Who I am today. I've tried real hard to become, you know, a healthy person. 

00:16:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Uh hmm. So it noticed you're saying, you feel very good about yourself right now and you'd like her to share that feeling good about yourself. 

00:16:20
SANDI Yeah. She has ways of, ah, reminding me of when I was behaving differently. 

00:16:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Bring it out. 

00:16:25
SANDI Oh, yeah. And, uhm, it's uncomfortable. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Hmm. 

00:16:35
SANDI She just can trigger things in me that I don't like in myself, old, old things. And I hope I'll be able to be comfortable while she's here. 

00:16:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, she triggers the past. And you're afraid that that's gonna make you feel pretty unsure of yourself and, and fearful almost. 

00:16:55
SANDI I have no priorities now. And, uhm, I don't wanna keep them that way. But I think if my mother comes to visit, I'm going to just be doing things to please her. 

00:17:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  So, you're not as sure of yourself when she's around. 

00:17:05
SANDI That's it. That's it. 

00:17:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. You're not sure of yourself when she's around? 

00:17:10
SANDI That's how I feel and, ah, gonna ask myself all kinds of questions. 

00:17:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Yeah. 

00:17:20
SANDI Do you really have this together yet? This one little mother who loves you, gets you this upset. 

00:17:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, it's almost, ah, ah, it's, it's because it's very threatening to you as well. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
SANDI Yeah. 

00:17:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Because once you start that unsureness(ph). 

00:17:30
Summarizing 1 

00:17:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Why do you, what are you here today for, Sandi? 

00:17:45
SANDI Well, you know I have a doctor's appointment. And I'm really paranoid about it. I'm having bad experiences with doctors because of the fact that every time I go, it seems like, uhm, you know, regardless of what it's for, they wanna put me on some form of a pill or other and everything like that and with my drinking. I'm finding it difficult to mix the two. 

00:18:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, so, you're wondering about ge, getting to the doctors and about your appointment about, was it about pills and things you were taking and what was the. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
SANDI Well, I have to have a couple of cysts removed just what it amounts too. 

00:18:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Well, I thought you were, the last time you're talking about I thought it was you, you were having some problems with alcohol or something like that. 

00:18:20
SANDI Well, I am not an alcoholic and everything, and I've really been drinking, and I, I just drink for pain and anything and everything. And I wanna quit drinking. But when I mix the pills with the drinking, it's like my squarely mind works or something like that. And, and there I go. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Are you sure you're sort of, ah, know what you're talking about, what you're doing 'coz I hear it's like you're, you wanted not to take pills and you wanna, you wanna take pills and you got to see the doctor about this, ah, I'm really confused of what you're talking about all now, Sandi. 

00:18:45
SANDI I am scared to death to go to the doctor and everything. I don't want him to put me on pills. 

00:18:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Well, why don't you say so that in the first place? 

00:18:55
SANDI Oh, well, what am I supposed to do? Well, okay... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. I mean. 

00:19:00
SANDI ....well, I don't want them to put me on pills. 

00:19:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Yeah, but that's what we, well, I just said to you that you didn't, you know, like it's confusing. It's confusing to me like you don't wanna be. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
SANDI Well, I'm confused. Of course, it's confusing. It's confusing to me. 

00:19:10
Summarizing 2 

00:19:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Chris, maybe we can start with where we left off just a few minutes ago. 

00:19:30
CHRIS And what do you mean? From the beginning? 

00:19:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Wherever you want. 

00:19:30
CHRIS Okay, well, like I said, I do have a doctor's appointment next week. And it's got me a little bit on edge. I'm just going through what has happened with my doctor's experiences in the past. I have to have a couple of cysts removed. And every time I go to a doctor, it seems like he puts me on some form of medication... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
CHRIS ...which starts getting my head working on a very get high type of thing. And I really don't wanna get high. I really don't, and I don't really know how to deal with it. I know, I had second and third degree burns on my hand. I went into the doctors and everything like that, and he knew I was on something... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
CHRIS ...whether it be drugs or alcohol or whatever. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
CHRIS Well, actually it was both. And when he didn't put me on pain pills, it's my own self that I resorted to go into the bottle. 

00:20:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  Okay. 

00:20:25
CHRIS You know, so, it's either or I'm scared of myself. I don't know what to do. 

00:20:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay. Let's see. I've heard a few things. I've heard that, that you got to see the doctor... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
CHRIS Uh hmm. That's correct. 

00:20:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...that you, and you have actually, cyst, I mean, that has to be removed. Surely, that means there's gonna be some kind of pain pills or some kind of pills, which you're going to have to take. But once... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
CHRIS Hmm. 

00:20:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...you start taking those pills for something that you really need, it gets you into wanting to be high. 

00:20:45
CHRIS Right. 

00:20:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. And you don't know how to handle this right now. 

00:20:50
CHRIS Right. 

00:20:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Okay. 

00:20:50
CHRIS Because they just, well, I have to keep going back to my previous experiences and everything, you know, like with my burns and everything. (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
CHRIS This is how sick you can really get in, in what we're doing, you know. And when in, and in the ambulance, I was really burned bad and everything I thought. (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Those are real, real burns. 

00:21:10
CHRIS They're real burns... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
CHRIS ...and everything. And I was more concerned about when you rolled up my sleeves, and you swallow my tracts(ph), and you smelled my breath. They could have amputated my hands for all I cared. And it's just, the feeling was so strange, and you know, 'coz I wanted him to give me something for the pain. I'm really, I can't deal with pain, I can't deal with physical pain. I don't know what to do. I really don't. I know these cysts are gonna be painful but I'm having them removed. 

00:21:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. Yeah, but I guess, I think it was gonna hear like, you, you got to have something, you're, you know you're gonna experience pain and you, and you're gonna, know that you're gonna want something for that pain, to relieve you from that pain. 

00:21:50
CHRIS Uh hmm. 

00:21:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. But then the consequences of that... (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
CHRIS Right, the consequences. 

00:21:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...maybe the, it may devastating to you... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
CHRIS Ah, yeah. 

00:21:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...in the long run are even worst that the pain... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
CHRIS Yeah. 

00:21:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...you're feeling right now. 

00:21:55
CHRIS Yeah. And that's what I need to know how to cope with. And I know, I'd probably project the, in other(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
CHRIS ...and making something. Well, I'm not gonna say it's something out of nothing because I'm always gonna have to slice. I know there's gonna be stitches involved. What I really wanna know, how much, how can you deal with physical pain or where does the psychological head-trip start in on you of getting high? (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
CHRIS I just, I don't know how I'm gonna deal with that. I really don't. 

00:22:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. And so, it's again, it's, as we keep going back to, to the... (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
CHRIS To the same thing. 

00:22:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...it's the same thing. But then, if I could add something else onto it, is that, one of the questions you're asking yourself is, "Could I take this pain... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
CHRIS Right. 

00:22:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. ...without taking any drug for it?" 

00:22:45
CHRIS Right. And I think that's something I'm gonna have to face. But I'm really not sure about it. And I'm scared to death about it. 

00:22:50
Probing 1 

00:22:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D.  What brings you here today, Bonnie(ph)? 

00:23:00
BONIE Well, I'm having a lot of problems. I'm, originally, from Pennsylvania. And I made it down here to Maryland about three weeks ago. And I'm completely lost and I'm feeling a lot of feelings of being alone. It's. (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So, where ab, whereabouts, where in Pennsylvania are you from? 

00:23:15
BONIE It's about 40 miles from State College. 

00:23:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. Uh-huh. 

00:23:20
BONIE Little town named Louis town. And, ah, I like the State of Maryland but I'm, it's a complete being at lost and with traffic and, ah, state of confusion really. Like I... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN, ED.D. So. 

00:23:35
BONIE ...when I go to meetings, like I don't know anybody at the AA meetings and I, I'm having the problems of relating and talking with people. 

00:23:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Where do you go into the meetings? Where are they held? 

00:23:45
BONNIE Ah, there are some in Rockville, Gettysburg. 

00:23:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Do you like the meetings? 

00:23:50
BONNIE Yeah, I like them but I'm getting, to feel left out, like I don't belong. 

00:23:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, we can always find some other con, I mean, you can always go some to other, can't you go to some other kind of meeting? Do you have to go to that meeting? 

00:24:00
BONNIE Yeah, I have to get AA meeting 'coz I'm an alcoholic and a drug-addict, and I, It helps me to around the people that are not drinking. 

00:24:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Did you take drugs when you're in Pennsylvania? 

00:24:15
BONNIE Yeah, a lot of drugs and alcohol. 

00:24:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. What kind drug, what, what kind of alcohol do you drink? 

00:24:20
BONNIE Anything. Tequila, beer, anything I get a hold of. 

00:24:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hmm. Do they drink at the alco, do they use ah, allow you to drink at the AA or (inaudible ). (crosstalk)

00:24:35
Probing 2 

00:24:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Bonnie, you were saying before about being kinda lonely and at lost. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that. 

00:24:55
BONNIE I don't really know how to talk about that feeling? It's just, It's just a lonely feeling. Ah, I guess the fear is really what hurts me more than anything, where I get so scared that I might say something wrong or somebody won't like me for what I say. 

00:25:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Tell me a little bit more about what would happen if you said something wrong. Tell me a little bit more of that fear. 

00:25:35
BONNIE I would probably cry. And I, I don't like to cry when I'm around people. 

00:25:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What would happen if you cry in front of me? 

00:25:45
BONNIE  I don't know, it'd be embarrassing. 

00:25:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Embarrassing? 

00:26:00
BONNIE Yeah, be uncomfortable. 

00:26:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Just embarrassing and uncomfortable. 

00:26:05
BONNIE Yeah. Hmm. 

00:26:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What would I, you know, what would, what would I do? I mean, what you're saying is that you're certainly embarrassed and uncomfor, what, what would be the worst possible thing that would happen, if you ended up crying? 

00:26:15
BONNIE  I don't know. I'd probably get angry before I cry. 

00:26:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I have a fear that I am making angry now. 

00:26:30
BONNIE  Yeah, you are. 

00:26:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Could you tell me a little bit more about it? 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:40
BONNIE  Well, I don't know. I'm just gonna get angry, I guess, before I cry, 'coz that I don't wanna cry. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:26:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And you're feeling that I'm pushing you into that position. 

00:26:55
BONNIE Yeah. I don't know what you're doing anyway. 

00:27:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Am I being helpful at all? 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:10
BONNIE  Become making me angry helpful, then I su, you know, I suppose. 

00:27:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  If you, then I would say, do you have a need to express that anger? 

00:27:20
BONNIE  Maybe I do. 

00:27:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Then why aren't you expressing it? I'm talking about stressing you. For me that's hard. 

00:27:40
BONNIE  What are you trying to do anyway? 

00:27:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Get in touch with you. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:27:55
BONNIE  You got me shaking.

BONNIE Yeah. Very uncomfortable.

NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Would you like me to back off?

Counselor Self-Disclosure 1 

00:28:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, the last time you're here, you talked about being angry at me. That I got you angry and, and I'm while at home I was thinking about that and, you know, I have another, I have a friend, and she came over after ah, dinner that night. And, and she's, did the same thing. We had, had the same kind of conversation, and you know what, she said I was making her angry. And I don't even understand how far I was making her angry. 

00:29:10
BONNIE What does this have to do with me? 

00:29:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
BONNIE That's your friend. 

00:29:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN well, I thought that you'd kinda be interested in knowing about, you know, the, the, in some sense we have a lot in common. And, and that I just wanna say that other people get angry, I mean, such as you, I mean, that, that I want you, maybe I, I'm wondering maybe if I make people angry or something like that. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:30
BONNIE  Well, I don't know. I'm here for me. And I was talking about my anger. You don't seem to be helping me very much. 

00:29:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, I know you're here for you, but like I was thinking I had some kind of ah, I just have a need to share that with you. Ah, I thought, you know, I just thought you'd become interested in what I had to say. But I, but I guess you're not. Let me, let me try to listen to, so, to, about what the issue is with you. 

00:29:55
BONNIE  Well, I was just saying that I was angry and I was having trouble dealing with it. 

00:30:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. Well, you know, angers are really kinda hard thing to deal with, I really understand that, 'coz ah, you know, sometimes, even though, and sometimes, you know, I have trouble getting angry resolved. And so, I, I can understand it. I think I hear what you're saying. 

00:30:15
BONNIE  You're not helping me very much. 

00:30:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh gosh, I really do wanna help you and you're, you're making me feel so bad by saying that. But then, a lot of people say that to me, so. 

00:30:30
Counselor. Self-Disclosure 2 

00:30:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  The last time you were here, Bonnie, you talked a little bit about the loneliness you are feeling here and Maryland now. I'm just wondering if you might talk a little bit more about what's happening. 

00:30:50
BONNIE Well, I still feeling lonely, like, you know, I, I try to walk up to people and, you know, kinda get in with them and feel like a part of it, but, like I just then, I don't know if it's something I'm doing or, I don't know, I just don't know. Ah. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I'm still. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
BONNIE I feel very, you know, uncomfortable here yet with you. Uhm. 

00:31:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  One thing that ah, that I might, that I'm going to share with you is that ah, I've also had those feelings of, of being afraid. Ah, every time somebody new, comes walking into this office and talk to me. I'm scared. I'm really scared. Every time somebody walks in, and I'm gonna have to sit down and, and talk to them and be helpful. 

00:31:45
BONNIE Do you get scared? 

00:31:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I'm, I'm very scared. 

00:31:50
BONNIE  Are you scared now? 

00:31:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN A little bit. I ah, and, and maybe, and one of the things I'm scared about is, is I'm gonna, am I gonna make a fool of myself. Am I gonna say anything that's going to even make any difference to you or to anybody. 

00:32:05
BONNIE  That's how I feel a lot when I talk to people and when I talk to you. But it don't seem the same. Uhm, I mean, and it's just, I don't know. I just don't feel like, I mean, almost good as you are. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And I must've surprised you when I said that I was just worried about, that you were important enough to me to worry about... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
BONNIE Yeah. 

00:32:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...how I was gonna come across to you. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
BONNIE Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN 'Coz I was wondering if I was gonna be good enough for you to be, you know, worthwhile for you to sit down there and talk to me. 

00:33:00
BONNIE That makes me feel good. 

00:33:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And one, one of the things that ah, I am concerned about is, "Do I have anything to offer anybody?" 

00:33:10
BONNIE  Well, I can see but you have more to offer somebody than what I would. 

00:33:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well why don't we, let's talk a little bit about more about what you've got to offer somebody. What have you got to offer to somebody as a person? 

00:33:25
BONNIE  Nothing, except a "hello" and a smile, maybe. 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  So, you mean, what you're saying is sort of, is well, I'd like to talk about, what I've been doing as I'm putting myself down. And when I say something like that, the more I'm really stepping out myself. And when I hear you, you're sort of stepping out on yourself, too. 

00:33:50
BONNIE Is that what I could be doing? 

00:33:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well it sure was what I was doing when I said the kind of things about myself as you're saying, well, I'm just putting myself down all the time. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:00
BONNIE  And maybe that's what I am doing. 

00:34:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You know sometimes there's reasons we'll have to put ourselves down. Have you ever thought about that, whether there's any reason? 

00:34:15
BONNIE I have but I've never come up with any answers and any reasons why. 

00:34:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I'll tell you what my reasons for putting myself down was. It was safer. I didn't have to take on any responsibility for anything, since I was a nothing and a nobody. So now, I don't have anything to get, I don't have to take any responsibility. And now that I'm sure if you will get, like I'm a somebody, that I'm anxious I really, it's, I wanna, I wanna give something. And that's even harder for me now. 

00:34:45
BONNIE You know, I, you know I feel like that. It's comfortable, you know, being in that situation. But what I'm doing now. 

00:34:55
Interpreting 1 

00:34:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, Bill, I wonder what you'd like to talk about today. 

00:35:05
BILL Well, I have this down feeling of confusion and frustration, I guess, really. I get angry, inside of myself when I can't do things that I want to do. 

00:35:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Don't you think that you're ah, really acting like a child, isn't that what were you really saying. Children get angry, and aren't you getting being childish about this? 

00:35:25
BILL I've acted this way all my life. 

00:35:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah, but that's I'm saying. You're, you're acting out immaturely, it seems to me. 

00:35:30
BILL  I'm, I'm telling you that this has happened all my life. And what, what you're telling me is not making me feel any less angry at myself. As a matter of fact, I'm getting a little angry at you. 

00:35:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I wonder if you're not projecting on to me some feelings you have about your, your own parents and you're just getting me confused. 

00:35:50
BILL I'm not angry, frustrated or confused about my parents. 

00:35:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, but I think that's a denial on your part. I mean, we certainly that part of that problem that ah, that we have as adults are reflection of where we were. 

00:36:05
BILL And not, my problem is more immediate than going back to my whole childhood and everything. 

00:36:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  All right. We'll then talk a little bit more and I'll see if I can, and maybe get another interpretation or at least another feeling. 

00:36:15
BILL I feel comfortable around women, okay? Ah, I can talk to them. I can even touch them. I have some close friends that are women, and we can talk in, in-depth as friends should, you know. And I feel what they're saying in, in both ways. But I can't ask a woman for a date. And, ah, ah, I've been sober a few months now, you know. And I say wait, wait, wait, you know, and the impatience gets in there, and because this is something that's been in me all my life, you know. I could never do this and I said you to you, you know, now, things are a little better, you know. Ah, ah, I'm a social animal, again, okay. I can go out and feel comfortable with all types of people. 

00:37:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I just really, you know, question whether you're ah, really ready yet to deal with your feelings of inadequacy. Now, that what's bothering you. 

00:37:15
BILL I. 

00:37:15
Interpreting 2 

00:37:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  The last time you were here, Bill, we were talking about your relationship with women. And I wonder if you'd still like to talk about that. 

00:37:30
BILL Yeah, I think so ah, and I still have this problem, you know, that, ah, it never happened during my lifetime, you know, that, that I couldn't reach out and ask women simple things, like going out for a date and, and getting to know, you know, somebody. And, although, what I thought getting to know on those days was something different. But ah, I could never do it. And now I get a little frustrated because things were a little better. 

00:38:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:38:00
BILL And ah, I have relationships with people. And I can talk with people. And I don't have any problem with women, as far as talking to them, walking up and ah, introducing myself straight off the streets, so to ah, speak. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
BILL And ah, being alone with a woman and talking and getting down deep. I don't have a problem there. But yet, I can't reach out and say, "Let's, you and I, go out together?" 

00:38:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Ah, ah, you're sort of looking at the fact that, that you're somewhat dependent on women to be assertive to you rather than you being assertive to a woman, that you give them the power. 

00:38:45
BILL This I, I recognize because it, it happened, okay. The, this was what happened with any woman in my life, and there haven't been very many but, particularly, my life. And ah, I have an extreme, at least had an extreme negative ego, as far as women go, okay, that they were on top, and I was on the bottom. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
BILL And, you know, I keep thinking of overcoming this for the fact that ah, I don't feel uncomfortable with them like I would have before. Ah, I can touch them. I can talk to them I can get serious with them about matters that concerned both of us. But I still can't, as you said, assert myself ah, in, in the simplest of things, like having ah, an exploratory relationship, yes. 

00:39:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well ah, another thing that I think I hear you saying is your relationship to wom, to women, or to even one woman, intimately, is that you, you're really the child and they're the adult in the relationship. That's, that's sort of saying I'm wondering what's going on inside of you. 

00:39:55
BILL I haven't thought of it in that terms. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN How does that feel? 

00:40:00
BILL That doesn't feel good and I wouldn't feel comfortable if I thought of it that way and, (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:40:05
BILL and really got no situation like that. Ah, I have to try as best as I can to be myself. 

00:40:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
BILL To be spontaneous. And if I look at a relationship the other way, it would be devastating. I'm afraid, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:40:20
BILL Really. 

00:40:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think it would, and now, but I'm asking you, if there's any truth to that statement, that is somehow in your relationship to a woman, you end up being, say, the child, they have end up being the adult, and that you're having, what you're trying to look as far as a relationship where two adults are meeting. 

00:40:35
BILL I, I, I can see, well, that may still be there bec, because I can remember ah, early in the sobriety, and begging almost uhm, begging literally. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
BILL Ah, perhaps I'm coming out in those words, conning(ph) and then not so, somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Should never really know. 

00:40:50
BILL ...would never recognized it, (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:40:50
BILL ...but asking somebody to come and take care of me, in a sense that, hey, you know, I, I have all these, similar to what I'm telling you now, but inside I was whining... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
BILL ...for this, you know. 

00:41:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm, what, what I think I hear you saying is, these are the women, you still are developmentally at a young age, rather than as an mature man. 

00:41:15
BILL Yeah, I, I, I would expect this, you know, and I, I'm not surprised that I, and emotionally, I'm at the ah, young level in several areas. (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
BILL Ah, due to my alcohol, but, as, because, you know, that arrested me for several years from any development. 

00:41:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I see. (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
BILL And yes, but you know, I, I know. You know, I keep saying I know, here I know. But ah, this isn't true anymore, this isn't true anymore, but still I can't do it. 

00:41:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So what you're. 

00:41:45
Confrontation 1 

00:41:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uhm, Bill, the last time you were up here, you're were talking about ah, I don't know what, and I wonder if that's what you wanna talk about today. 

00:41:55
BILL Well, I think we're back to the point that ah, I was a little immature, from the fact that I couldn't ah, approach a woman... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
BILL ...as far as asking her for a date. 

00:42:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
BILL And, ah, I think that's where we ended up. 

00:42:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So, what's new? Anything changed in the last couple of weeks? 

00:42:15
BILL No. I, it still hasn't been done, all right, and I was just here to try and get a little more comfortable, comfortability with myself, a, as far as being able to do this. Ah, I still don't feel comfortable about going out and asking a woman. There's, there's something not quite right there. 

00:42:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I kind of ah, hard time believing that, for some reason that you even, I don't know. It's sort of like you're whining to me. 

00:42:55
BILL  I'm sorry if it comes across that way. 

00:43:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm. 

00:43:00
BILL I am not whining anymore. I'm truly asking for help. I want to do this. I need to do this. 

00:43:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, if you need to do it and you wanted to, why did you ah, come here, look I'm a woman, and you certainly don't do anything new(ph), to, to make anything happen between us that's worth much while happening, for a woman who didn't even want to go out with you. 

00:43:25
BILL I don't know what turns you on and I don't have the capability of turning women on if that's what it requires. I just want a simple, when I... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You know, one of the reasons you don't have a, 'coz you're not very perceptive. You're still into your own need system that you couldn't even care about mine. 

00:43:40
BILL I'm the only person that I know anything about. I would like to get in to somebody else's system. I have to do it in my own first before I get to somebody else's. 

00:43:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's a pretty useless statement you just made. Couldn't you. 

00:44:00
Confrontation 2 

00:44:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What do you wanna talk about tonight, Bill? 

00:44:10
BILL  I think we ended up where I was still at the immature level on ah, (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
BILL being assertive ah, with a woman as far as dating. And ah, nothing new has happened in my life. It's still at that level. I haven't been able to take that step out yet. 

00:44:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, one of the things that's bo, that's bothering me during the last couple of weeks we've been talking about this, is your words pretty powerful that you really don't want to take steps and so forth, but emotionally, your voice is absolutely flat. I hear no uhm, you know. In the tone of your voice, I hear nothing, and I'm having trouble dealing with that, and maybe is that, I'm having trouble believing some of the things you're saying tonight. 

00:44:55
BILL  I, you know, I, I can't develop my presentation, the, I feel very deeply about it. 

00:45:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Yeah. 

00:45:10
BILL I don't, perhaps, express my emotions as much often than as I used to. Ah, but ah, the feeling and the pain, is, is still there, of wanting something and not being able to do anything about it. When I know I either have accept it or do something about it. 

00:45:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  I look at your face now and I feel that you're troubled about what I'm saying, and that you're almost even angry at what I'm saying, yet I feel that you're giving me all these, these illogical arguments. And it's, it's always these illogical arguments, to(ph) sort of get out of the situation. 

00:45:50
BILL I think I have to. I am not lying, but I have to use my intellect a little bit on situations like this where, I guess what I'm saying is, I can accept the fact. I can continue to live the way I am. But I feel incomplete. I want more. 

00:46:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, so, if, somehow, you're acknowledging the fact that you're denying your feelings in order to protect yourself, in case this is the way you've got to live. 

00:46:25
BILL  I feel uncomfortable with that. Ah... (crosstalk) 

00:46:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  What's making you uncomfortable? You know can. 

00:46:35
BILL The fact that I'm maybe be denying my feelings. That's something I don't want to do. 

00:46:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN But you're acknowledging that you're denying them? 

00:46:45
BILL  I'm getting, a, a feeling that, perhaps, that ah, I want this more than I'm being willing to admit it. And it confuses me. 

00:47:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Now, I wanna push you hard on dealing with that confusion. I wanna(ph) push you hard because what, for the first time, I hear you did not try to rationalize away this whole thing. 

00:47:20
BILL  It's something that I feel it has to be a part of my life. 

00:47:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:47:30
BILL That. 

00:47:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  And now what... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
BILL Pretty. 

00:47:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Go ahead. 

00:47:35
BILL To complete things and ah, in, in, in a sense, for me, that I feel like I'm in an unnatural state right now... (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
BILL ...for me. 

00:47:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:47:45
BILL That I don't feel I wanna live the rest of my life this way, and that is alone. 

00:47:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
BILL And I wanted to do the necessary things, and yet, you know ah, I want things to be right and yet I know they can't be right. 

00:48:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Is it right, are you're saying that you're willing to take the risk that's necessary to feel complete. Are you willing to take that risk? (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
BILL Hmm, we both know that I haven't taken that risk and I'm afraid. And I have to become willing to make, take that risk, yes. 

00:48:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I think I believe you about being afraid, but I guess I don't believe you about, willing yet to take that risk. 

00:48:30
BILL  Maybe that hurts not enough, yet, and so, ah, I've been able to live a fairly comfortable life for a change and it's something new. And I guess what I'm saying is, am I willing to risk the whole thing to sacrifice what comfortability I have now, for more. 

00:49:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I feel, for the first time, you're being a little, being more honest with me. And you're not kidding yourself and you're not kidding me. And now the question is, the next step, are you willing to take the risk? And I think that we still have to work on. But at least I think that you own the fact that up until now, you have been really willing to do it. 

00:49:15
BILL  That's, but I guess if I hadn't been, I would have done it and Ah, I know that.
