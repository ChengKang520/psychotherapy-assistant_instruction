With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:00:50
and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal, and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

00:01:50
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. I'd like to welcome you to another session of Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:01:55
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest, Leigh McCullough, who's going to talk to us about her approach to brief therapy. Leigh, just what does brief therapy mean to you? 

00:02:05
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 1-1 

00:02:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, it means a great deal and I've devoted the last 20 years to studying it and researching it. Um, uh, we began - and I want to emphasize this long before managed care ever came into existence, a full decade earlier. And our goal was to try to make therapy as effective and efficient as possible and in as limited a time period as reasonable for the patient. Um, when I think of short term therapy, I think of the therapist being active and involved and highly focused on the, the predominant issues and that, and I'll repeat again, trying to work in as time limited a fashion as possible, but varying that time depending on the needs of the patient. 

00:02:45
1-2 

00:02:50
JON CARLSON When you say we, who are you referring to? 

00:02:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, you know, I've worked in, uh, research groups all this time. 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Oh, okay. 

00:02:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I haven't worked in isolation. Um, the first, um, research group was with Arnold Winston at Beth Israel Medical Center in, um, New York City. And, uh, I've worked with a group in Norway and a group at University of Pennsylvania and now at Harvard University. So there's always a lot of people. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) So, so you really mean, "we." 

00:03:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, I really do mean "we." 

00:03:15
JON CARLSON Can you talk about just what your strategy is, just what your approach is to brief therapy? How does it work? 

00:03:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Well, my particular approach is a psychodynamically based approach. 

00:03:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:03:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So I follow the, uh, what is called the universal principle, psychodynamic psychotherapy, uh, that defenses and anxieties block the expression of true feeling. And David Mellon, uh, my mentor, and a, a British psychotherapy researcher conceptualized this principle in what he'll call the two triangles. 

00:03:45
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Oh. 

00:03:45
Triangle of Conflict Self D Defense A Anxiety IF Impulse-feeling 

00:03:45
1-3 

00:03:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And I'll repeat, defenses and anxieties block the expression of true feeling and that pattern of behavior, that psychodynamic conflict can be seen being played out with the therapist, with current persons and with past persons. So, I try to identify that pattern and we're going to see this in the tape again and again. We try to identify the defenses. Uh, we try to identify what feelings they're, uh, warding off and why the anxiety or conflict why, uh, the feelings are being warded off. And that was a very useful schema that has guided all my research and my clinical work for the last 20 years. We'll operationalize those concepts as, as, uh, we see the tape. But, uh, there was a problem we had. How to, how to, um, put these concepts into action in therapy. And, uh, what we did was, uh, develop three main, uh, objectives in treatment. 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:04:40
1-4 

00:04:40
Triangle of Conflict -Defense restructuring -Affect restructuring -Self-other restructuring 

00:04:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, defense restructuring, affect restructuring and, uh, self-other restructuring. Now, uh, would you like me to go in to discuss that a little bit now or? 

00:04:55
JON CARLSON That may be helpful because it sounds like although this is brief therapy, it may not be short term because you're working with really changing the whole character structure of the individual. 

00:05:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. Yeah. Um, that's why I said you have to be open to varying lengths of time, but here's how I think about short term therapy. Um, sometimes people can come in who are healthy and well-functioning and in one to five sessions make major changes in their life. But people who have had decades of character pathology are understandably not going to, uh, change those patterns of behavior in 20 or 30 sessions. They may need 40 or 50. They may need up to 18 months of therapy. But if you change 40 years of behavior in 18 months, I'll call that short term therapy. 

00:05:40
1-5 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Boy. 

00:05:40
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Brief. 

00:05:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I call that brief, relatively speaking. 

00:05:45
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:05:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Um, and, uh, that's, that's an accomplishment, but you have to have the character change at the end to make it qualify as a short term treatment. 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON Well, can you talk like you were going to about just how change occurs in your approach? 

00:05:55
1-6 

00:05:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. Um, well change occurs I think in, in, um, uh, mainly through the process of desensitization. Now you might say, "Why are you using this behavioral terminology in a psychodynamic treatment?" And, and it's because I was trained in learning theory originally and then I learned psychodynamics and by putting the two together, I changed, in my way of thinking, long term therapy into short term therapy that both long term and short term psychotherapy try to analyze defenses, uh, that block feeling, but in short term therapy, I will use all kinds of active interventions, um, and predominantly I use desensitization. 

00:06:35
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Oh, okay. 

00:06:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH  I keep seeing that a, a psychodynamic conflict is nothing more than an affect phobia. You know, n behavior therapy, we have bridge phobics and elevator phobics and they, and they have to expose themself to the bridges and the elevators and desensitize themself and prevent the response, uh, of running away. 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:06:55
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 1-6 

00:06:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH In my treatment or in dynamic treatment, the phobia is within us. It's our grief. We're afraid to feel grief. We're afraid to stand up for ourselves. We're afraid to be open and tender and close with people. So that phobia has to, uh, has to have exposure to be resolved. And so, you'll see, uh, what I'll be trying to do is teach the patient to see the way they're avoiding and to prevent that avoidant response, to see their defenses and actually want to stop running away. And then to face the feeling that's so painful and desensitize that to reduce the anxiety associated with the warded off feeling. 

00:07:35
1-7 

00:07:35
DIANE KJOS So, you're, you're really using behavioral concepts and psychodynamic concepts. 

00:07:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes, yes. 

00:07:40
DIANE KJOS And earlier you had told me about a, um, meeting or a discussion you'd had with, uh, Skinner. 

00:07:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, I did. That's interesting you bring that up. Um, he said something to me that changed, uh, forever the way I thought about, uh, reinforcement theory. He was walking down the hall, and I was a graduate student, and he said to me, "You know, after, you know, thinking about this for so many years, there's one, there's only one thing I would do, there's only one way I would, uh, modify behavior. I would, I would use no, nothing negative. I would use no punishment. I would only reinforce successive approximations to the desired behavior. In other words, he said if I wanted my child to read, I would never punish or push. I would only reward them for the slightest movement toward the bookshelf. 

00:08:30
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

00:08:30
1-8 

00:08:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now that really stayed with me and, in fact, I do a tremendous amount of that in my work. 

00:08:35
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:08:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Just slowly, uh, reinforcing or encouraging and supporting the patient, uh, feeling, uh, what they need to feel to, um, uh, change the, uh, defensive behavior. 

00:08:50
JON CARLSON So, you begin early on having a clear goal and it's that clear goal that you're both working towards. 

00:08:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Oh, yes. Yeah, as soon as possible. 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) In, in much the fashion that B.F. Skinner was able to get pigeons to play ping pong and all the various things that he was able to do. 

00:09:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Well, well, you know, I, I think that's probably true. That, um, I, I, um, hope I don't treat my patients like pigeons, but I do try to shape the behavior of, from, as soon as I can formulate where they need to go. 

00:09:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Pigeons. 

00:09:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, but I would want to say that that's a collaborative process. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:09:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And I'm always asking the patient, "What do you think? Does this feel right to you? If it doesn't feel right, then we're not on the right track." And so, I work with them in that. 

00:09:30
JON CARLSON And for all we know, not all of those pigeons wanted to play ping pong anyway. Some might've played hockey or something else. 

00:09:40
1-9 

00:09:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right. That's right and if they had been able to voice that, it would've been preferable than to, uh, work with, uh, their wants and needs. 

00:09:45
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) So, you, you're checking that out? You're watching? 

00:09:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) All the time. 

00:09:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:09:50
JON CARLSON Well, can you talk about the type of client though that this approach might work best with? 

00:09:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, Well... 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON Or is there somebody it might not work best with? 

00:10:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) That's... Right. It, it's, um, the way the treatment has evolved, we've been able to see that it, it reaches a wider span of patients than I had thought. I use the global assessment scale, as a rule of thumb, for guiding how I intervene. And I noticed that there were so many criteria for when to use short term therapy, I couldn't keep them all in my mind. Sifneus had seven. Develyn (ph) had five, and so forth. But, uh, I noticed on the global assessment scale if you look at the cutoff of 50, right in the middle of that 1 to 100 rating of global functioning... 

00:10:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Right. This is off the DSM 4? 

00:10:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH This is off the DSM4. ...that 50 and above is moderate impairment and functioning. 

00:10:35
JON CARLSON Okay 

00:10:35
1-10 

00:10:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And if a patient is moderately impaired, they, they have relationships, but troubles in relationships. They have jobs, but maybe they get fired repeatedly, but they get another job. That's moderate impairment or better. They're able to, um, roughly, uh, you can, you can move ahead in an active, uncovering treatment looking at defenses and feelings. If, however, if a patient falls below 50 on the global assessment scale, that would be, uh, severe impairment and functioning. 

00:11:05
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH No friends, unable to get out of bed, unable to hold a job. You certainly don't want to go about uncovering defenses, pulling out deep seated powerful feelings if they're not able to get out of bed in the morning. They're not able to handle that feeling. 

00:11:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:11:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So below 50, and again these are rules of thumb, not laws of nature, but below 50, I tend to try to build defenses and cognitive therapy is a wonderful tool to use in, um, in that, um, in that group of patient rather than tear them down. 

00:11:35
JON CARLSON So, that's an example of how you tailor your particular strategies to the particular client that you're working with. 

00:11:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes, yes. Right. 

00:11:40
1-11 

00:11:40
DIANE KJOS I know you've been doing some research and can you talk a little bit about that and how that's um . . . ? 

00:11:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, I'm very proud of the research that's been accumulating over the years. Uh, there are a number of process studies that look at, uh, the, uh, differential effects of affective and defensive responses to interpretation. Um, and, but there are also two major clinical trials on this treatment and so the treatment that we'll be seeing today is, is, um, going to be in the next few years meeting criteria for an empirically validated treatment, uh, that is, that there is substantial enough research support backing it up, uh, to suggest it's, uh, validity. 

00:12:25
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Wow. So, this will be what they, I think, refer to as a manualized program then? 

00:12:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, it is manualized. My book is the treatment manual and it's been . . . 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:12:30
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 1-11 

00:12:30
1-12 

00:12:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, there's one clinical trial with follow up, both published by, um, Arnold Winston and the research group that, uh, researched this, uh, short term dynamic treatment at Beth Israel Medical Center and the second clinical trial which has been completed and the, uh, the follow up results have just been, um, uh, sent to me just this week, uh, as conducted by Martin (inaudible ) and Tore Stiles at the University of Trondheim in Norway. And, and both I'll just sum up. Uh, it, it demonstrated that the short term dynamic therapy, um, showed, uh, efficacy, uh of almost a full standard deviation on many of the, uh, outcome measures and compared favorable to cognitive and, uh, to another form of brief therapy. 

00:13:15
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Well. 

00:13:15
DIANE KJOS Well, Leigh, Jon and I are both, uh, Scandinavian as you can tell by our names and so we wouldn't think those, of those people as being a much different culture, but what about the multicultural applications? Here, have you... 

00:13:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Well, I have had a little bit of, um, experience with that. I supervised that project for seven years. And, uh, Norwegians are remarkable gifted therapists. They're deeply feeling and, and have strong, uh, interpersonal connections. Uh, I'm generalizing across a culture, but, uh, it's... 

00:13:45
1-13 

00:13:45
JON CARLSON It includes Swede's too. 

00:13:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Um, yes. And, uh, and I was concerned about the Norwegian's applying, or many people have been applying my model because personality, uh, wise, I appear much more exuberant and active and involved. 

00:14:00
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:14:04
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And they were, um, on the surface more reserved, of course, just, uh, culturally. Yet, they were powerful treatments, deeply feeling. They reached, uh, patients in a very profound way and did very impressive treatments. 

00:14:15
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm. 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON So, you're believing that it does cross cultural lines. 

00:14:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, it was in this sample, you know, of therapists. Uh, very, uh, adaptable. 

00:14:25
JON CARLSON Can you talk about the, the, maybe specific strategies that you use in your model? If there are some ones that might be unique to it. 

00:14:35
1-14 

00:14:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right. Yeah. I began talking about that a little earlier, um, but I'll highlight the six main components. 

00:14:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah, highlight it. Yeah. 

00:14:40
Triangle of Conflict Defense restructuring - to help clients see their defenses 

00:14:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, in defense restructuring, um, we have two objectives and one is to help the patient see their defenses. You can understand, a patient can't give up what they're doing. 

00:14:50
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:14:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH If they're intellectualizing, they can't stop intellectualizing if they don't know they're ntellectualizing. 

00:14:55
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:14:55
Triangle of Conflict Defense restructuring -- to help clients see their defenses - to motivate them to want to give up their defenses 

00:15:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But we found that people would say, "Yeah, I know I intellectualize. I know I'm passive, but so what. That's the way I am." So the next strategy was you had to motivate them to want to give up the defenses. And you're going to see me in the tape that comes working hard at trying to help her be more motivated to give up the defenses. 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:15:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH The next two, um, uh, objectives fall under the rubik of affect restructuring. Again I'm thinking of change all the time. 

00:15:25
JON CARLSON Mm-hmm. 

00:15:25
Triangle of Conflict Affect restructuring - affect experiencing 

00:15:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, the first is affect experiencing. The second is affect expression . They're not just a semantic difference. It's a profound difference in, um, experience. 

00:15:30
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
1-15 

00:15:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH One is the inner experience of the feeling. Let's take for example, anger. So many people can't identify when they're anger, or angry, and they feel terribly shamed or anxious about that feeling. So, they don't let themself experience it fully. And affect experiencing helps expose them to that feeling and process it in fantasy where it's safe rather than act it out. The second stage is very different skills. Affect expression. Uh, it's very different how you feel. We may want to murder our boss, but obviously, we need to sit down with the boss and say I'd like to negotiate this point and to negotiate it strongly. So I'm always working between those two poles, um, on affect. And then the last two objectives were actually encouraged from me to include, by the Norwegian colleagues. 

00:16:20
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:16:20
Triangle of Conflict Self-other restructuring - changing clients' inner representation - changing clients' sense of others 

00:16:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH They said, "You know, while you're doing defense and affect restructuring, you're changing the person's sense of self and changing their sense of others. And as, you know, I said, "Yeah, that's obvious in there" and they said, "But your, it's not explicit. You've got to make it explicit." And so, uh, I do that and say, you know, work with changing the inner representation of how the person views themself and views others. It has a tremendous impact on change to do that. 

00:16:45
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:16:45
1-16 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON So you begin with coming aware of your defenses, then motivating to change your defenses. 

00:16:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON Working in the affective area of being able to become aware and then to be able to express. 

00:17:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yes. 

00:17:00
JON CARLSON And then the, the final two are this, uh, self and others. 

00:17:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Changing the inner image that is carried of themself and others. 

00:17:10
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Of yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, in a moment we're going to watch you work with a young woman who is in an abusive relationship. And, and I, this is, um, I apologize if I put you on the spot here, but could you give me a sense of where her global assessment of functioning is? 

00:17:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right. Um, I think she has to fall below 50. 

00:17:30
DIANE KJOS I wondered about that. 

00:17:30
1-17 

00:17:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Between 40 and 50 on the global assessment scale. However, um, her functioning is really quite high, under all this stress. 

00:17:40
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:17:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Her occupational functioning . . . she's supporting the family, paying the bills, uh, taking care of her child and um, and has connections with friends who care about her. 

00:17:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:17:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, she gets higher ratings, in the 60's and 70's for, for two of the three criteria for global assessment, but the global assessment rating is the lowest, um, the weakest link in the chain. 

00:18:00
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:18:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, the fact that she is allowing herself to be abused would put her somewhat below 50 or right at that, um, there. 

00:18:10
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Okay. Okay. 

00:18:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, and that's why I said earlier, this global assessment scale is a rule of thumb, it's not a law of nature. 

00:18:15
DIANE KJOS Sure. 

00:18:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH She has so many strengths that I went on and, and, uh, confronted her on some of that. 

00:18:25
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) And worked with that. Yeah, yeah. And what were you thinking about before you started working with her? 

00:18:25
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know, I, I really wasn't thinking of anything much at that point. 

00:18:30
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:18:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But I, I, uh, said to myself, "Well, this is going to be videotaped for teaching. Maybe, maybe I should go over all my objectives and the techniques that I use and have them in my mind so I can make sure to use all of them." And then I said, "No Leigh, don't do that. It'll be forced onto the patient. It won't be the natural responding to what the patient does, so let it go and, uh, you know, see what comes out of the tape." 

00:18:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:18:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, in fact, many of the techniques that I use are, were demonstrated in the tape, but that's because the techniques I use came from the study of videotapes. 

00:19:05
DIANE KJOS Yes. Yeah. 

00:19:05
1-18 

00:19:05
JON CARLSON Can you, uh, set this, um, video up for our viewers? Is there anything that they should specifically look for in terms of your responding and... 

00:19:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm. Well. Mm-hmm. This is, uh, the first thing that comes to mind is this patient was being badly abused and it was extremely painful for me and I wanted to jump up and down and, uh, you know . . . 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON So, we should watch your restraint. 

00:19:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, I can't believe my restraint because inside I'm exploding. 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:19:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That's one. The other is that I, I think the enormous repetition. I confront her over and over and over again using the same words. I want to reach her in a way that it stays with her in the coming weeks. 

00:19:45
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) It's a learning theory. 

00:19:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH There are dozens of times I, I confront her and then ask her to look at the longing and the pros and cons of her defenses. 

00:19:50
1-19 

00:19:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:19:55
JON CARLSON Wow. 

00:19:55
DIANE KJOS It's just, um, very emotional session. 

00:19:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It really was. 

00:19:55
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:00
JON CARLSON Well, let's watch it. 

00:20:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

00:20:00
2-1 

00:20:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Can we begin by your telling me what you'd like help with? 

00:20:05
MARCY Um, my, uh, I'm in counseling for, um, like me and my husband fighting a lot. 

00:20:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm. Mm-hmm. You and your husband fighting a lot. 

00:20:20
MARCY Yeah. 

00:20:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. How long have you been married? 

00:20:20
MARCY Just a year, but we've been together for five years. 

00:20:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. So, can you give me a, an example of the fights you have? One of the, not a specific fight. 

00:20:30
MARCY A lot of, have to do with money and like he gets, he takes it out of me and stuff. 

00:20:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mmm. 

00:20:35
2-2 

00:20:35
MARCY And he gets abusive and stuff. But... 

00:20:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, can you tell me, uh, of a time, uh, when he's gotten abusive? 

00:20:50
MARCY Um, I yell, I argue a lot with him, like when he sleeps a lot. He sleeps. 

00:20:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:20:50
MARCY He doesn't work. He doesn't do nothing and I complain. Then he gets up and he just tells me he can't take it no more and instead of walking out, he just starts attacking me and stuff.. 

00:21:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm. He attacks you how? 

00:21:05
MARCY He's kicks me and (inaudible ). 

00:21:06
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH He kicks you? 

00:21:06
MARCY Yeah. 

00:21:06
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, how bad has it gotten? 

00:21:10
MARCY Oh, it's been, so many, I don't know. It's been bruises. 

00:21:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:21:15
MARCY And just I have been in the hospital a couple of times for it. 

00:21:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You've been in the hospital a couple times. That's pretty serious. 

00:21:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:21:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Is this the first time you've gotten help or talked to anyone about this? 

00:21:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:21:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's so good that you've gotten here. 

00:21:30
MARCY Well, I talk to my friends about it, yeah. 

00:21:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Um, and what do they say? 

00:21:35
MARCY To leave him and stuff. 

00:21:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:21:35
MARCY See, I think it's a lot to do with me because I get angry and I call him names and stuff 'cuz he's Mexican and I'll go out and say, I'll, I'll hurt him and stuff. 

00:21:40
2-3 

00:21:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You'll, you'll say things that hurt him? 

00:21:45
MARCY Yeah. 

00:21:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what I'm hearing is, you're blaming yourself for his behavior. 

00:21:50
MARCY (crosstalk) Well, it has a lot to do with me too though. I'm saying that, you know, I mean, I could prevent it by not, you know, yelling at him and just agreeing with him. 

00:21:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:21:55
MARCY You know, fine, if he wants to sleep, let him sleep, you know. But sometimes I get frustrated when I get off work too. 

00:22:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:22:00
MARCY I have to cook, clean and do everything and he just sits there. He'll pick a Q-tip and throw it on the ground and I'll go, it's like, "What are you doing?" and he's like, "It's your job." 

00:22:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:22:05
MARCY  And I just get really, you know, and then I start screaming at him for it. 

00:22:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, at that moment you get so mad that you start screaming? 

00:22:15
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And then it escalates . . . 

00:22:15
MARCY Yeah. 

00:22:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, to the point where he ends up physically abusing you in some way. 

00:22:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:22:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Um, and how often does this happen? 

00:22:30
MARCY Uh, it would, it stopped for like three weeks and then it goes on usually once a week. Sometimes twice, three times. 

00:22:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Once or twice or three times a week. 

00:22:35
MARCY Yeah. It depends. 

00:22:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And it's gotten so bad, you've been put in the hospital. 

00:22:40
2-4 

00:22:40
MARCY Well, not overnight. I just go in there for like my nose or else I have bruises real bad, they swell up like . . . And . . . But I just, I, some of it's my fault though because, uh, I think if I could prevent it by stop screaming at him. But just, it's hard. It's hard to . . . 

00:23:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's hard to rein yourself in. 

00:23:00
MARCY (crosstalk) You know, but it's 'cuz he's Spanish and I know he expects a lot different of me than what I was dating before. 

00:23:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:23:05
MARCY And I do clean. I do cook. I work. I, you know. 

00:23:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You're supporting the family. 

00:23:10
MARCY But I practically pay the bills on my own. He works too. 

00:23:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:23:15
MARCY But I'm making barely anything and I pay most of the bills. 

00:23:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:23:15
MARCY And it just makes me mad because I know he could do better than what he's doing. 

00:23:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why do you stay with him? 

00:23:20
MARCY Because I have a son and I'm scared to do it on my own. 

00:23:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. You're scared to do it on your own? 

00:23:25
MARCY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. Um, what are you most scared of? 

00:23:30
MARCY Um, just to fail or not be able to make the money to pay the bills and stuff. 

00:23:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Just to, to fail. And how would you... 

00:23:35
MARCY Because I left him for a couple weeks at a time. 

00:23:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:23:40
2-5 

00:23:40
MARCY And it's just, it's scary 'cuz he's a good father to him, but it's just, we just can't get along. 

00:23:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mmm. 

00:23:45
MARCY It's just when we're away from each other it's better than... 

00:23:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:23:50
MARCY We're together, we fight everyday. 

00:23:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Everyday? 

00:23:55
MARCY (crosstalk) There's an argument. Yeah. But every argument . . . There's an argument every day, but it's not always hitting. 

00:24:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Well, there's, there's several things here to, to look at and one is, uh, just for your own safety in the immediate future is how to handle the anger, uh, so that you don't illicit the attack. 

00:24:15
MARCY Yeah. 

00:24:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But the other is, do you want to stay with this man and how to, how to help you take some steps. 

00:24:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. See, I know it has a lot to do with my problems too, and like my past and stuff. 

00:24:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:24:25
MARCY How I, you know, I was raised and stuff. And my mom was abused by my father, so I thought, you know... 

00:24:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, that's the way it is. 

00:24:35
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. And it's... 

00:24:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Did you really think that? That's what... 

00:24:35
MARCY Well I never knew my father, but I knew that she had lost all the self-esteem against herself. 

00:24:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:24:40
MARCY And that's why she put herself in the predicament of having eight children with this man and never being, you know, treated good by him. 

00:24:45
2-6 

00:24:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:24:45
MARCY And I feel like I never had a father figure then I latched onto to somebody that will take me, you know, real quickly. 

00:24:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Uh, and are you in contact with your mother? Does she know this? What does she say? 

00:25:00
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. She tells me to leave him and it's like, "Well, you never did" and it's hard, you know. Everybody could say to leave him, but nobody understands. 

00:25:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. She doesn't? 

00:25:05
MARCY I don't want to move back at home. I don't. 

00:25:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. You don't want to move back to your mother's. No. 

00:25:10
MARCY It's, yeah, I can't. It's just, she's got another, my sister living there. 

00:25:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
MARCY And two of her kids. And we just, the way they live, I cannot live like that. 

00:25:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, right now, there's not a place to go. When you, or is there? 

00:25:25
MARCY Well, no, I could, I could go work, like, live upstairs from my boss's work, you know. 

00:25:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You could? 

00:25:25
MARCY But it's just the money. I mean, it's impossible to make that much money enough for the bills, for food and everything for my job. 

00:25:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. So, if you went to live upstairs, you're boss has offered you a place. 

00:25:35
MARCY An apartment, yeah. 

00:25:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. But you can't afford it? 

00:25:40
MARCY Mm-hmm. So, I mean, I'm looking for another night job or something, you know. 

00:25:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH To fill in. 

00:25:45
MARCY Yeah, but daycare, daycare is a hundred. It's a lot of money for daycare. 

00:25:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:25:50
MARCY So, it's impossible for me because I'm paying daycare and paying the, you know, half of the rent already, so... 

00:25:55
2-7 

00:25:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:25:55
MARCY And daycare and then plus if I had to buy the food and stuff, there's no way that I could make it on my own. 

00:26:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. So, right now, you're financially trapped in it? 

00:26:00
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:26:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And you've left for a couple weeks and gone where? 

00:26:05
MARCY To my mom's. 

00:26:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH To your mom's? 

00:26:10
MARCY Well, yeah, that's... 

00:26:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. And then what makes you go back to him? And what's his first name? 

00:26:10
MARCY Miguel. 

00:26:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Miguel? 

00:26:15
MARCY It's, um, just him calling me and telling me he's sorry and then sometimes he doesn't, he thinks it's, like he goes, "You know it's your fault that I get in that predicament to hit you." He goes, "people don't understand. Like, they see these, they see these soaps on TV or whatever like shows." Talk shows. And he says, "They don't understand. It's not the man. He's like, it's the woman that talks so much that they get it." 

00:26:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you believe that? 

00:26:35
MARCY He had a, no, but he had a rough life too though and I understand. He had a really rough life. He got dropped off on Mexico here when he was thirteen. His mother didn't even, I mean, nobody really cared about him. 

00:26:45
2-8 

00:26:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH A lot of people have a rough life. It doesn't, and you're making, you're saying that as though it excuses him beating up his wife. 

00:26:50
MARCY I tell him he can, if I start arguing, he can just get up and walk out for about an hour until I- calm down instead of staying there and taking it out on me. 

00:27:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, you know what the appropriate behavior is in a man? 

00:27:00
MARCY Yeah. 

00:27:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And you know how serious it is? 

00:27:05
MARCY Yeah, it's really serious. 

00:27:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. You talk about the talk shows. What have you seen on the talk shows? 

00:27:10
MARCY I mean, it's the same thing. I feel like I'm the same way as him. I complain, you know. I do argue, but... 

00:27:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:27:15
MARCY And then he tells me he's not going to be able to little wimp, a little girly by helping me out, you know, like with cooking or watching my son or changing my son's diaper. 

00:27:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:27:20
MARCY He won't help me out like that 'cuz he says I'm not going to be a wimp like that. I was like, "We're married together." It's like, "You should help me as a family, you know, instead of making me do it all while you sit down and watch the, watch TV every time you get off work. 

00:27:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, it stays in this battle between the two of you and then you . . . 

00:27:40
MARCY That battles' been going on for a while. Like, as soon as he got home, his dinner was ready and I just took off 'cuz I knew we would fight. And I'd go to my mom's or something for a couple of hours until he'd be sleeping 'cuz I don't wanna, I'm just so sick of arguing. 

00:27:50
2-9 

00:27:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) I see. Yeah, so that's a step toward taking care of yourself. It's just getting out of the house yourself when you know it's going to happen. 

00:27:55
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And that's what I want to focus on the most is, well, I guess you're blaming yourself and, uh, thinking it's your fault that, that, for his behavior. And also, what, what can you do in the short term and what can you do in the long run. And I want to just spend a couple more minutes going back to the financial aspects and the practical things and then let's go to how you feel about yourself verses him. But you said you financially were not able, right now, to make it on your own. 

00:28:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:28:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What, uh, what thoughts do you have about who you could contact? Are there women's shelters that can help you out there? 

00:28:30
MARCY (crosstalk) Um, no. I, I don't wanna go 'cuz, uh, he's a good father to my child and I don't want to take my kid away from him. I know it's not right for him to hit him in front of me, but he's still a good father when I'm not around and I could never take his son away from him. I know it would kill him. It would. 

00:28:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, you, um, would put yourself in physical jeopardy to keep your son... 

00:28:50
MARCY No. I'm thinking about, my boss wants me to save money and just give it to her to hold onto and, you know, she could save it for me until I can save enough to get out on my own and live upstairs or whatever in her apartment. 

00:29:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
MARCY And then once I can do that, he can see the, my child like on weekends or whatever, but... 

00:29:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right, he could have visitation. 

00:29:05
2-10 

00:29:05
MARCY So, that's what I need to do, is, like, try to save up, but it's just, bills keep on, you know, coming up and it's kind of hard to save when you don't get time to do it. 

00:29:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, so are there other avenues you've explored of sharing a house with other single mothers or other... 

00:29:20
MARCY (crosstalk) No, I... 

00:29:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH  You haven't thought of that? I mean, are there less expensive living arrangements? 

00:29:25
MARCY Um, there could be, but . . . 

00:29:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And are there support networks? This is something you might need to explore in the community for mothers in your situation. 

00:29:35
MARCY Uh-huh. 

00:29:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I'm not from this community, so I don't know, but there are in some cities. Have you looked into that? 

00:29:40
MARCY Mm-mm. 

00:29:40
2-11 

00:29:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Maybe we can ask, uh, about that after this. Um, so there's just some practical planning and you've already started doing some planning, but it's hard and you need help and there, there might be a community support for you. 

00:29:55
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:29:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, um, but your long range goal is then to separate from him and give him visitation with the child. 

00:30:05
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. We got in a fight once because, uh, he left the house and he said he was leaving and I just sat down and let him. You know, I'm not gonna, I didn't force him to stay at home and then he took off. 

00:30:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:15
MARCY Ten seconds later, he came back in the house, started packing up my son's bag and said he's taking him. 

00:30:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:30:20
MARCY I'm like, "You're not taking him." I was like, "I'll have do whatever I have to do from, from stopping you. You'll never take him." 

00:30:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:25
MARCY  And he goes, "But you can take him when we get into a fight." I was like, "Oh, you hit me. I don't hit you." It's like, you know, I don't want my son to see his mommy get hit. 

00:30:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:35
MARCY My son is starting to hit me from it now and I don't want my kid to, you know, be the way I was when I was younger, like to witness a lot of stuff. 

00:30:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. How awful for you. Yeah. And what happened then? 

00:30:50
2-12 

00:30:50
MARCY He didn't take him. I mean.... 

00:30:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) He didn't take him? 

00:30:50
MARCY I wouldn't . . . I mean if I had to go out there and flatten all his tires, he would not take him. 

00:30:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
MARCY I don't care what I would've done, but he didn't take him and then he goes and, he goes, um, "You're gonna get upset 'cuz Victor's leaving?" I mean, "Yeah." And then he goes, "What about me?" I'm like, "No, I wouldn't be upset if you left." 

00:31:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:05
MARCY And then he got mad and that's when I got hit again. I'm, I'm telling him, which I should lie maybe to prevent getting hurt. 

00:31:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Well, let's looks at that. Should you lie? What do you think? 

00:31:15
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. I think I should until I get, you know, to the point that, you know what I mean? 

00:31:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:20
MARCY It's hard though. It's so hard to tell him something that's not really true, you know, like . . . 

00:31:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. Let's stay with that at that moment. 

00:31:25
MARCY Uh-huh. 

00:31:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's really hard to tell him something that's not really true. 

00:31:30
MARCY Uh-huh. 

00:31:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, because there's so much anger in you and you feel like exploding and you, but then it's provocative and it pulls it back on you because he's an out of control person. 

00:31:40
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:31:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, at that moment, what could you have said? 

00:31:45
MARCY I could've said, "Yes, Miguel. I want you to stay home too. I love you and then, I mean . . . 

00:31:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. But that would be hard. 

00:31:50
2-13 

00:31:50
MARCY (crosstalk) But then again, but then again, he could, you know what I mean? No matter what I say sometimes, I try and it ends up me getting it wrong again. 

00:31:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:55
MARCY So, I mean, anything I really say, it's, you know, I'm scared to say it. And one day I fought back at him for hitting me. 

00:32:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
MARCY You know, I jumped on the bed and I stuck my feet out because I knew he was coming after me. 

00:32:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:32:10
MARCY And he started coming at and I kicked him. He goes never fight me. 

00:32:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. 

00:32:10
MARCY And I don't know whether to stop fighting him or fight him back or to, you know, sit around... 

00:32:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, what happened then? 

00:32:20
MARCY He, I, I got it worse. I got punched in the head so many times I thought, I mean, so many times I get hit in the head, I think that I will never wake up, you know. I'm just going to keep on getting hit, that I'll . . . 

00:32:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah. You were afraid you were gonna die then? 

00:32:30
MARCY It happens a lot though, that I feel crazy like that. 

00:32:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:32:35
MARCY I'm just scared to leave him. 

00:32:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH There must be someplace that... 

00:32:40
MARCY I left him once. 

00:32:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:32:40
MARCY I told him I didn't love him. He cut open his arms and I woke up in blood all over me and all over him, you know, and he was okay but, you know, it was scary and I'm scared now that he could do the same thing again. 

00:32:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. You were worried for him? 

00:32:55
MARCY Yeah, I am. 

00:32:55
2-14 

00:32:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why? 

00:32:55
MARCY 'Cuz I care about him. He's the father of my son. I don't want to be with him, but I don't want to, him to, you know, my son to be without a father. 

00:33:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. And what about your son being without a mother? 

00:33:05
MARCY That's true, but, you know, it's like, I've... 

00:33:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But what? I mean, you just told me you were... 

00:33:10
MARCY (crosstalk) I have no self-esteem. I mean, I don't have no, I care about my son a lot. I do love him. 

00:33:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:33:15
MARCY And I know people say, "How can you love him, but you don't love yourself?" I will do anything for my son. And there's nothing... 

00:33:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Sure. You'll do anything for your son? 

00:33:25
MARCY Yes, I will and I'm trying to get out of there. 

00:33:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but what is your son going to do if he's, if he's left only with your, your husband? 

00:33:30
MARCY Yeah. 

00:33:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You said he was hitting you so much in the head that you didn't know if you were going to wake up. 

00:33:35
MARCY Yeah, it happens a lot. I mean... 

00:33:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That happens a lot. Where you don't know if you're going to live... 

00:33:40
MARCY (crosstalk) He's a black belt in karate. I mean, there's no way I can protect myself from him. Not at all. 

00:33:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, that's, this is hard for me to hear. That's, you know and I'm in the business of listening to painful stories. Uh, what is it like for you hearing that from me? 

00:34:00
2-15 

00:34:00
MARCY It's scary. 

00:34:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's scary? 

00:34:00
MARCY Yeah. 

00:34:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. What's scary about it? 

00:34:05
MARCY That, I don't know, maybe, I know I should like leave him and I know everybody is saying to leave him, but nobody's in my shoes to say, "Just get up and go." 

00:34:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:34:15
MARCY You know, it, it's impossible just to get up and go. 

00:34:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:34:15
MARCY I mean, nobody thinks, I don't like my son to see what ha-, what goes on. 

00:34:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:34:20
MARCY I just have to deal with it until I can make my own money. 

00:34:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You said, let me go back. You said it was scary, my reaction. 

00:34:30
MARCY Yeah. Yes. 

00:34:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's so painful for me to hear is scary. It tells you something. 

00:34:35
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. That I have a problem. Yeah. 

00:34:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. That, that really bad things are going on and that you're in a lot of danger. 

00:34:40
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. But sometimes it's, sometimes he can be great to me. 

00:34:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:34:40
MARCY  Sometimes for two or three weeks, we can be like excellent. 

00:34:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, but . . . 

00:34:45
MARCY And then one day, just . . . 

00:34:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But look at the price you're paying for," sometimes it can be great." 

00:34:50
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:34:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You see? You don't have to pay that high a price. 

00:34:55
2-16 

00:34:55
MARCY He cried once when he hit me and that's when I was pregnant. And he punched me in the face and my nose and I fell to the ground and that's the only time he cried. He goes, "I'll never hit you again. I promise." And after that, now it's like a, he feels like he's doing it so much that it's normal. It's normal life. 

00:35:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:35:10
MARCY And he, he doesn't want me to leave him, but I says, "You know, we have to get a divorce." I really want to divorce him and he just doesn't agree to it. He goes, "I don't want my son to be without us to be together, as it could be better for us to have, you know, we could see him whenever we want to see him. You could see him whenever you want to see him. But we cannot be together." He says, "No, I don't want a divorce. My kid belongs with a mother and a father. 

00:35:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. It looks like you're, you're trying to reason this out with him. 

00:35:35
MARCY It's not. It shouldn't be with a mother and father if this is going to happen. I really want a divorce from him. 

00:35:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right. No. So, intellectually, you know this? 

00:35:40
MARCY Yes. 

00:35:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, and our job tonight as much as possible, is emotionally how to help you get there. 

00:35:50
2-17 

00:35:50
MARCY We were fighting before we even got married and I didn't want to get married. 

00:35:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:35:50
MARCY He needed his papers to stay in this country. So, that was hard. 

00:35:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) You did that... 

00:35:55
MARCY I did it because, uh, he needed his papers and I wanted him to stay with his father. 

00:36:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:36:00
MARCY So, and then it just ended up being crazy and as soon as he gets his papers, I want to get a divorce, but he wants to stay, he wants to stay for good. 

00:36:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH As soon as he gets the papers? 

00:36:10
MARCY Yeah, his papers to be with, he belongs with his father, you know, with my son. He does. I cannot take my kid away from his father, my father, his father, but I can't be with him no more. 

00:36:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, I mean, you've got a lot of things to consider. What kind of father is he going to be, uh, when he's alone and what danger do you have of him taking your son? Have you thought of this? 

00:36:35
MARCY He took him at daycare. Well, he told me he was going to take my son at daycare and take him to Mexico, so now he doesn't have no rights to pick him up from, you know, from daycare. 

00:36:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. So, you've got a really serious problem. And you have a hard time protecting yourself and sometimes when mothers are in these situations, the most they can do is take care of their child. 

00:36:55
MARCY Mm-hmm. 

00:36:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what's going to happen if he takes your child to Mexico? 

00:37:00
2-18 

00:37:00
MARCY I'd never give him an opportunity to take him. I mean... 

00:37:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. You watch him. 

00:37:05
MARCY I never, yeah. I'll never give him a chance to be with him alone like that. 

00:37:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Wow. I see. So, you're being very protective that way? 

00:37:10
MARCY Yeah. 

00:37:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I mean, let me go to, you're saying you have no self-esteem? 

00:37:15
MARCY Mm-hmm. 

00:37:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Have, have you, were you beaten? 

00:37:20
MARCY (crosstalk) I used to. I used to be. I cared about myself a lot and then after I had Victor, I stayed big. 

00:37:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
MARCY And he's like oh... 

00:37:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You stayed big? 

00:37:30
MARCY Fat. You know. And then he goes . . . 

00:37:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That worries you? 

00:37:30
MARCY Yeah, it does, 'cuz I feel better about myself when... 

00:37:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:37:35
MARCY 'Cuz he goes, "Oh, you're so fat" and then "Oh, you, you're putting too much make-up on. You look like a clown. Oh you." You know? 

00:37:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:37:40
MARCY You do your hair to go to your, go out or something. I go to bingo with my mother and I put make-up on for the older ladies there to say, "You look nice." I mean, it makes me feel good. 

00:37:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:37:50
MARCY And I think that's sick that I have to go to bingo for my, these people to talk to me like that instead of my husband treating me with respect. I think it is. I think he should be nicer to me. 

00:38:00
2-19 

00:38:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Were you physically abused as a child? 

00:38:00
MARCY Uh-uh. I only had my mother though my father has been dead since I was two, three. 

00:38:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I see. So, you didn't know your father. 

00:38:10
MARCY No, I just . . . 

00:38:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, you haven't been abused? 

00:38:15
MARCY No. 

00:38:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so, you said there was a time when you did feel good about yourself? 

00:38:15
MARCY Yeah. I felt good about myself until I guess I met him and then... 

00:38:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And somehow you're listening too much to an abusive man. 

00:38:30
MARCY Well, sometimes now it's like, it's getting to the point that he's yelling at me and I'm just sitting there looking at the walls just ignoring. 

00:38:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:38:35
MARCY Just like, he's crazy and I'm not listening no more. 

00:38:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:38:35
MARCY Just let him keep on going. 

00:38:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:38:35
MARCY And then when he, and then I hear him and he says something that, you know, pushes a button and it escalates and I just get, I get hit for it when I yell. 

00:38:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. And it... Uh-huh. 

00:38:45
MARCY Like, he goes, "Oh, your mom, she's so old. She's going to die of cancer." And I mean, you know, it just hurts me. He goes oh, you're a fat slut. 

00:38:50
2-20 

00:38:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Okay. In that situation, let's go to that. Your mom, she's old. She's going to die of cancer. And so, he's trying to provoke you. 

00:39:00
MARCY Well, I do it too. I provoke him a lot too. I was like you never had a mother and your mother didn't care about you neither. He's like, "don't talk about my mom. At least I have a mom." I mean, it'll go back and forth until... 

00:39:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Words are one thing. When people get mad, they say things to try to hurt, but, but he's using physical violence and there's no excuse for that and you keep, you keep saying that there's some excuse for what he's done to you. 

00:39:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:39:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Some part of you knows that's not true. 

00:39:25
MARCY Well, I feel I shouldn't provoke him. I could, you know, I could change it a lot. I could stop him hitting me most of the time by just him, if he calls me a name or something, just go, "Okay. Okay." You know, instead of fighting him back going, "No, I'm not" you know and screaming back. 

00:39:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. All right, let's go to that. If he called you a name and you shrugged, how would it be living in that situation? 

00:39:50
MARCY I don't want, I don't want to live in there either way. I, I wouldn't want to live in there. 

00:39:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right, um, but what is the way that's going to make you blame yourself less? 

00:40:00
2-21 

00:40:00
MARCY I might, myself leaving and there and just to get on my own. 

00:40:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right, right. I guess what I was thinking is, um, again you keep saying if I could just not provoke him. 

00:40:10
MARCY Just until I get enough saved up to leave him. You know, and just for us to have an understanding that we're not, we don't belong together. And I just wish he would understand that we don't belong together 'cuz we really don't. 

00:40:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why is it that you, you need him to understand? Why do you think he will understand? 

00:40:30
MARCY (crosstalk) 'Cuz it, 'cuz I want it to be a mutual divorce. I don't want to fight over nothing. I just... 

00:40:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I see. 

00:40:35
MARCY I'm tired of fighting. 

00:40:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) It's not some magical thinking. You've got a man who... 

00:40:40
MARCY Yeah, I know. 

00:40:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know, is gonna, you know, is punching you in the face. 

00:40:40
MARCY Wishful thinking, yeah. 

00:40:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's magical thinking that there's gonna be some, uh, uh, reasonable divorce here. You're, you're wishing for something that's clearly not going to happen. 

00:40:55
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. 

00:40:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. How does that make you feel? 

00:41:00
MARCY I don't know. I just, I just wish that things would be a lot different. 

00:41:05
2-22 

00:41:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's really tragic isn't it, what's happened? 

00:41:10
MARCY Yeah. I hate my son seeing me get hit. 

00:41:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:41:15
MARCY That's the thing that hurts about me, not me getting hit. Him seeing it. 

00:41:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Why doesn't it matter that you get hit? 

00:41:20
MARCY 'Cuz I don't care. I just, I don't care about myself. 

00:41:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) You don't care? 

00:41:25
MARCY I really don't care if it, you know, if anything happens to me. I just, I sit. 

00:41:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) You don't care if anything happens to you? 

00:41:30
MARCY No. 

00:41:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why not? 

00:41:35
MARCY I don't know. 

00:41:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, just stay with that. Do you want a tissue? You don't care if anything happens to you? 

00:41:40
MARCY Not anymore. 

00:41:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Were you always like this? 

00:41:45
MARCY Until I met him, I just... He used to, when I met him at first, he used to stalk me. I'd go to like paper chef parties or something and he would be out the window looking at me and he goes, "I seen you talking to some guy." And I was like, "it was the person that was having a chef, paper chef party's husband." 

00:42:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:42:05
MARCY And I mean, he would look through the windows at me and I never, never let it bother me. And I thought then, I mean, I wanted a baby. 

00:42:15
2-23 

00:42:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Was this before you were married? 

00:42:20
MARCY It's when we just began to date. And then I wanted a baby like after a couple years of dating and he wanted a baby. That was stupid. It was . . . 

00:42:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Did you not care about yourself then? 

00:42:25
MARCY I did. I cared about myself. 

00:42:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You cared about.... So, something has happened here that's, that's fairly recent to where you're saying you don't care what happens to you. 

00:42:35
MARCY Well, you get put down so many times, you just start to just give up. 

00:42:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:42:40
MARCY I used to take care of myself everyday. 

00:42:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:42:40
MARCY I used to do my walk around, you know. Exercise, put make-up on, curl my hair and take care of myself everyday. 

00:42:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:42:45
MARCY And I always go out and buy myself something special once in a while, but now it's like... 

00:42:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:42:50
MARCY  The clothes, I go, "Miguel, I don't have no clothes neither." And he goes, well you don't need them. You got fat friends that can give them to you." Like, what do you mean, I got fat." I was like, you know. 

00:43:00
2-24 

00:43:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what you're telling me is that after getting beaten down physically and mentally, you're like, you're like a concentration camp victim or, you know, someone who, who's, who's been... 

00:43:15
MARCY I'm just so used to it that, you know. I'm just so used to it. 

00:43:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, like the boxer down on the ring, uh, gets beaten so much, they don't even try to get up anymore. 

00:43:25
MARCY Uh-huh. It's just I get, you know, I, I get mad because, uh, the neighbors, we live in an apartment. They hear it and they won't even call the police. And if they call the police, then I might make him go to jail. I'm not even scared no more of putting him in jail 'cuz I'm tired of getting hit, but I'm just, I'm so used to it. It's been a, you know... 

00:43:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Have you ever called the police on him? 

00:43:40
MARCY Um, I didn't. One day I was in front of a laundry mat to get him and he bent my finger back and I was getting a ticket on my car for parking the wrong way and she seen me crying. She goes, "What happened?" I was like, "Nothing.' And she goes, "what happened?" And I told her and then she called the police and they took him to jail right away. They're like, "I'm tired of it." 

00:43:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:43:55
MARCY The whole town knows him. 

00:43:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:44:00
MARCY They took him to jail and then when he got out of jail, he goes, "See, all the men in there were doing the same thing. 

00:44:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:44:00
MARCY All the women like to talk. That's why they get hit and they think it's our fault." 

00:44:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:44:05
MARCY I mean, it's just... 

00:44:10
2-25 

00:44:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so, you're one of these women who . . . You blame yourself? 

00:44:10
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:44:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH How much do you really blame yourself? 

00:44:15
MARCY I blame myself because I think I can control my anger by screaming at him a lot. 

00:44:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:44:20
MARCY I think I could be a little bit calmer. But I mean, I've always been, you know, like I get really frustrated when I'm constantly cleaning and cooking, cleaning and cooking and then I come home. Like I come home today, the house will be all.. 

00:44:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know, anybody who's living in this amount of tension is frustrated and when you're frustrated, you feel like exploding. So, you're blaming yourself for exploding. Yes, it is wiser for you to shrug it off, but I don't know how much a normal human being can take. And the answer is to walk out. 

00:44:50
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Like I ask him about his money... 

00:44:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now let me stop you. You went quickly away. 

00:44:55
MARCY I'm sorry. 

00:44:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, that's all right. I'm just, just this an important, uh, point here. You said, you've asked him, "Why don't you just walk out?" 

00:45:05
MARCY Uh-huh. 

00:45:05
2-26 

00:45:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know, which is what a mature man does before he hits somebody. But also, um, and it's understandable people get angry. They lose their temper, but what about you just removing yourself? 

00:45:15
MARCY I can't. 

00:45:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, you can't? 

00:45:20
MARCY He won't let me. 

00:45:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. He won't let you leave? 

00:45:20
MARCY He blocks the door. I try all the time. 

00:45:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. I see. So you try to get away? 

00:45:25
MARCY (crosstalk) When I try to go to the other room and just leave him alone. 

00:45:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right, so... 

00:45:25
MARCY He leaves, like I'm arguing with him in the bathroom. 

00:45:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, so am I hearing that you're, you're blaming yourself for exploding when you're trying to get away, he's blocking the door, he, he continues at you and we all have a limit. So, you're blaming yourself. 

00:45:45
MARCY Not for that, no. 

00:45:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH No, not for that. 

00:45:45
MARCY You're right, yeah. 

00:45:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:45:50
MARCY That's right. But like, the money problems too, it's like, he goes, I go, "Miguel, did you get paid today?" He won't tell me what he makes. I'm like, "Well, I need help with the bills and stuff." And he won't help me. He won't tell me what he makes and I... 

00:46:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Why, why do you ask? 

00:46:05
MARCY 'Cuz I think that we should both have the money together. It shouldn't be just his. 

00:46:05
2-27 

00:46:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. This is true. But the point I'm making is there's more magical thinking here. There's an illusion you're carrying about him and about the marriage that is in part keeping you there. That, that ig you ask him and if you reason with him, there's going to be something... 

00:46:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Like if he could buy diapers or if he could buy, you know, something or, I mean, it just, he has the money, but whenever he doesn't have the money, I give in. I give it to him and then it's, I give him more money than anything. I just constantly give in. And then Kathy, the other day my boss goes, um, she goes, um, I go, "Could you give me some money so we could go out to eat?" You know, 'cuz she, she owes me money. She could pay me every day if she wanted to. And I was like, "No, it's all right, you know." And she goes, "No I'm not paying you right now. I don't have no money." And then she looked at me, she goes, she won't give me money for him. 

00:46:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:46:50
MARCY She goes (inaudible ). She goes, "You know I'll do anything for you," but she goes, "but I'll not do it for him." 

00:46:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:46:55
MARCY And it kinda, you know, it made me mad in a way, but then again it made a lot of sense that she's not gonna, you know, want me, she doesn't want me to do it. She just finished going through a divorce herself. She's not gonna, she went through the same stuff. 

00:47:10
2-28 

00:47:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, you've got people all around you wanting you to leave. 

00:47:15
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. And that's what he says, is he's like, "You're gonnalisten to people that all go through divorces. You're going to listen to all them people. You can't, you don't know anybody that has a normal family?" I'm like, "Actually, I don't." I was like, "Everybody's going to have problems." He goes, "One of your friends is sleeping around and they're married." 

00:47:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:47:30
MARCY I'm like, and it's not my, you know, it's, you know, it's not my fault. "He goes, "What about you? When you go out with them, what do you do?" I was like, I've never cheated on him and, you know, I never will. I never, you know, it's like, I married him. I didn't marry him for me to cheat on him. I would never think of that, even though it's not working out. I could never... 

00:47:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And that's . . . .The real issue is your inability to leave, leave this marriage and you're telling me there's nowhere to go. Um, and I think there's, with some work, there probably are places you can go. Am I right on that? 

00:48:05
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Yes. I could go to shelters and stuff, I know. 

00:48:05
2-29 

00:48:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) If you, you could go to shelters, but also then find some living arrangement that you could afford. Um, the, the issue is why you don't care enough. And you said the... 

00:48:20
MARCY See, I don't want to take off like that. I don't want to just leave him and him not knowing where me and my son are. 

00:48:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You don't? 

00:48:25
MARCY I don't think it's right because I think he should be part of my son's life. My son loves him dearly and I mean, he does, he loves him too. I mean, we have our problems, but... 

00:48:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now, okay, let me go into that one. You don't think you should just leave and get you and your son away from him even though he might kill you? 

00:48:45
MARCY No. 

00:48:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you, what do you think about that? 

00:48:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah, I understand. 

00:48:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Even though he has beaten you to... 

00:48:50
MARCY (crosstalk) It's scary 'cuz I feel like leaving him and then the next day things are fine and normal again. (crosstalk inaudible ) 

00:49:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So you pay, you pay a huge price for that little bit of normal time. 

00:49:00
MARCY Yeah. 

00:49:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Which isn't normal because he's not being a full partner and he's not helping, but just because he's calm, then you are... 

00:49:10
2-30 

00:49:10
MARCY Get back into that. Yeah, I do. 

00:49:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. You'll be seduced back in, the longing is so great. Am I right? 

00:49:15
MARCY Right. 

00:49:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH The longing... 

00:49:15
MARCY (crosstalk) It's great to get along with him. You know, us be a family and going somewhere to the park together and not fighting and like... 

00:49:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Have you ever had a boyfriend that treated you kindly? 

00:49:25
MARCY Shit, I used to, I was like, I used to dump guys a lot. I used to, I used to dump guys for wearing squared boots. 

00:49:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:49:35
MARCY You know, I'd dump guys for anything. And they were really good guys. I mean, I mean, before Miguel, I met this guy. He was a great guy, really nice guy, but he was balding and I'm like, I didn't, and actually it was stupid because now, I look back and I was like, it never should've been like that. 

00:49:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:49:50
MARCY Should've been for somebody that took good care of me, not, somebody that was a good guy. 

00:49:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right, so, it sounds like in the future you'll have a very different take on it, but the issue right now tonight, and it's a serious issue, is how to help you move out of that house and you're saying you don't want to, um, you don't.. 

00:50:10
2-31 

00:50:10
MARCY I want him to know where we are. I do. I want him to know where we are. 

00:50:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why? 

00:50:15
MARCY For him to see my son. 

00:50:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Where's your, you want him to see your son. That's so important. That's more important than your son having a mother. 

00:50:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. No, it's, I think, you know, I want him to be with me too. I, you know, it's just wishing that things could be okay for him. You know for me and him to be together. 

00:50:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) For, then there's the magical thinking, isn't it? 

00:50:35
MARCY So, there's, you don't think there's no hope of him getting better? 

00:50:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What do you think? 

00:50:40
MARCY If he gets counseling or something. 

00:50:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What do you think? 

00:50:40
MARCY I think if he can get counseling, maybe, you know, or help, you know, knowing that's he's got problems too. 

00:50:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, you've watched the talk shows, you said. What do they say about the husbands who, uh, beat up their wife? 

00:50:50
MARCY Once you get hit, it always happens. 

00:50:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, once you get hit, it always happens. Right? It escalates. Right? 

00:50:55
MARCY (crosstalk) Yep. Yeah. 

00:51:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, that's information you're not wanting to listen to? 

00:51:00
MARCY I know. 

00:51:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. Is that really painful to face? That once you get hit, it always happens. Yeah. 

00:51:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, what's the worst part of that? 

00:51:20
2-32 

00:51:25
MARCY It's my kid not having a father. 

00:51:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Victor won't have a father. 

00:51:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What, what's the worst part of that? 

00:51:40
MARCY I never had a father. 

00:51:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You didn't have a father. I see. And you're not wanting to put your son in the same place. Your mother never remarried? 

00:51:50
MARCY Uh-uh. 

00:51:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you think it's going to be like that with you? 

00:51:55
MARCY No, I don't care about me remarrying. 

00:52:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right now you probably can't even think of that. 

00:52:00
MARCY I just don't want him to be without his daddy. 

00:52:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:52:00
MARCY He does so much with him. 

00:52:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

00:52:05
MARCY Constantly plays ball with him. He does, you know. He's always with him. 

00:52:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

00:52:10
MARCY And I don't want him to lose that. 

00:52:15
2-33 

00:52:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But you can't even trust that he won't take him away to Mexico. He's threatened this. There's a serious danger here. But the, but the, one of the, one of the really painful thoughts that, that came up was you don't want your son to be without a father. And there is no man in your life that was a father figure? 

00:52:40
MARCY No. 

00:52:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, that's something you're gonna have to make sure that Victor has. Right? Whether you remarry or not. Aren't there men in the community that you could, uh, or in your family that would good? Have you thought about that? 

00:52:55
MARCY (crosstalk) I don't know. Actually no. Well, actually, no. Everybody, I mean, in my family, I mean, I don't, nobody treats my son, in my family, like he's anything because he's Mexican. He's not part of, you know. My mom calls him a spic. I mean, it's just, and it kills me. 

00:53:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:53:10
MARCY I just don't, I don't, I don't really like that. It's my baby. I mean, call my husband what you will, but . . . for me, just, downs my baby. 

00:53:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm-hmm. 

00:53:20
MARCY It just gets bad. 

00:53:20
2-34 

00:53:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. So, you're worried you won't be able to find a father figure. 

00:53:25
MARCY I don't want a father. I want him to be the father. I know it's hard. I know what you're saying. It's not right to think that way. 

00:53:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Let me just say this straight out. If, if it doesn't work out with Miguel and if he's not, uh, a reasonable, uh, uh, husband or parent, you're, you need to find a father figure for the boy. That'll be important and you've said that hurt you so much. Uh, (crosstalk inaudible ). 

00:53:50
MARCY It's not that it hurt me. I just see what I missed out on. 

00:53:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right. You don't want your son to miss out on the same thing. 

00:53:55
MARCY Yeah. 

00:53:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But you're paying too high a price for a father figure. What if your father had lived and you watched him beat up your mother? What, what good would that have done even if he were good to you? Have you thought about that? If you didn't know if your mother was going to live or die. If you... 

00:54:10
MARCY That would be scary, more scary than the thought of leaving. Yeah. 

00:54:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What would you want your mother to do? 

00:54:15
MARCY Leave. 

00:54:15
2-35 

00:54:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

00:54:15
MARCY And that's why my family a lot blame it on her and says, "You know what, you could've left dad, we could've lived a normal life. 

00:54:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. And here it is again and what I hear you saying overall, and it's understandable. You, you so long for the marriage to work. You so long for it and you think if you could just calm down, it would be normal. 

00:54:35
MARCY Uh-huh. 

00:54:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, but remember what you've heard: once they start hitting, the hitting continues. So, whether you provoke or say something or not, there's not any insurance here that he's not going to be in a bad mood. So you've got this longing that things are going to be, uh, reasonable, but it's what I've called magical thinking. It's an illusion. 

00:54:55
MARCY Mm-hmm. 

00:55:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Those are my words. Can you, do you believe me? Do you feel that? 

00:55:00
MARCY You're right. You are absolutely right. It's hard not to believe that way. I mean, I don't have nothing to look forward to, you know. 

00:55:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. You have nothing to look forward to. 

00:55:10
2-36 

00:55:10
MARCY And that looks, I look forward to, you know, okay, we're going to go out today and there's not going to be no fighting. 

00:55:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:55:15
MARCY And like me putting, like, coming home one night, after making dinner and him watching TV, me putting my arm around him instead of him pushing me away. Him just hugging me back. 

00:55:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. Right. So, so, what I'm hearing is that there's nothing, one of the horrible things about breaking up this marriage is that you're saying there'd be nothing to look forward to. 

00:55:35
MARCY Well... 

00:55:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. I, I could see how it would feel that way. 

00:55:40
MARCY Well, I, I don't have nothing for myself now going on in my life. 

00:55:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:40
MARCY He doesn't hug me. He doesn't say nothing nice to me. 

00:55:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Uh-huh. But as long as he's there, you can create an illusion around him and a hope... 

00:55:50
MARCY Saying things might be normal. Yeah. 

00:55:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Maybe it'll be normal. Maybe it'll be normal. Maybe it'll all work out. Um, and when you think about being alone, you think about not being able to pay the bills, never being married again, all these things. You're, you know, a pretty young woman. You have a life ahead of you and yet you, you are having an awfully hard time even thinking about, uh, having another life. Huh? So, it makes you trapped, doesn't it? 

00:56:15
MARCY Yeah. 

00:56:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you think it's really true that you'd never have, uh, a better life [00:56:205]after leaving Miguel? 

00:56:15
2-37 

00:56:15
MARCY Well, you know, my husband even told me that, or my boss told me, she goes, "You don't know how many people will be behind you once you leave him. You'll get a lot of help." 

00:56:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:56:25
MARCY She goes, "You need furniture, I'll help you." 

00:56:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
MARCY "You need, you're late on any payments . . .", she goes, "we'll work something out." 

00:56:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, it looks like, uh, there's an invitation there. 

00:56:35
MARCY It is, it's just... 

00:56:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Hmm? So, it's not that you don't have a place to go? 

00:56:40
MARCY (crosstalk) Scary. It's scary too. It is. 

00:56:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Well, let's go through as many of the fears as we can 'cuz you're saying you're gonna have, she's saying you're gonna have so much support. 

00:56:50
MARCY And how do we know that for sure though? I mean... 

00:56:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:56:50
MARCY People will say that and then, you know, turn their back on you when you need it. 

00:56:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Well, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Do you think she would? 

00:57:00
MARCY No, I know she wouldn't, but I mean... 

00:57:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) She wouldn't. 

00:57:00
MARCY Who knows where I can, I mean, what happens if I run out of, you know what I mean, I don't have no money for food or something? I don't wanna depend on nobody. 

00:57:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) What happens, what happens if you get beaten senseless? 

00:57:10
MARCY Yeah. 

00:57:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, here's the way you're thinking now is saying is, there's are a lot of financial fears, which is understandable. And, and before this, I mean, when this session is over, I'm going to ask about community supports and try to find out who knows and can put you in touch with this 'cuz it's serious. This is really serious what's going on with you. Um, but there's a, some sense that, uh, he's, uh, providing so much financial support. Well, for one thing, if you separate and go to court, he has to give you some child support money. Have you thought about that? 

00:57:45
2-38 

00:57:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. He actually doesn't help me though. I mean... 

00:57:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH He might help you if the courts mandate it. 

00:57:50
MARCY Yeah. 

00:57:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH He doesn't help you now, you say? 

00:57:50
MARCY Well, sometimes he does. He goes, "I supported you for four years. Now it's your turn." 

00:57:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:57:55
MARCY I'm like, "I can't pay all the bills on my own." And then, that's why we fight 'cuz I, it's, I get stressed out. I have to pay like the electricity and, you know, everything and it's just, it's hard. 

00:58:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) So you're, so, you're, you know, it's not clear what's happening financially, but it's, it's more that you so long for your family to be intact and you're not, you're willing to take physical abuse to keep this hope alive. And it's a hope that doesn't have much basis to it. 

00:58:25
2-39 

00:58:25
MARCY Like now, it's like I have a, he gave me his car. Well, I gave him, I had three cars before that and he blew the engines or whatever and I understand, you know, they weren't, they weren't brand new cars in the first place, but then he lets me borrow his car and then he says, when he gives his boss back his truck, well then that's too bad. He goes, "It's my car." I'm like, "Well, how am I gonna bring Victor to school? How am I gonna get to work?" He says, "That's not my problem." And I get mad because whenever he needed me, I was always there to help him. Always. And now it's like... 

00:58:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what has that gotten you? 

00:59:00
MARCY Just angry that he could just, you know, treat me like I'm not worth him. That, you know, I'm not there, out to hurt him and he knows that. And it's just, he just can't, you know, help me out too. 

00:59:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. It must be hard for you to understand how someone could be like that. 

00:59:15
MARCY And I'm always doing, but I do for him and then I do too much. I feel like I'm doing it. He's not giving me back anything and that's when I get angry with him. I'm like "Well, Miguel, I've been giving you money. You can give me money for shoes for me and whatever." 

00:59:25
2-40 

00:59:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You keep going back into the stories about asking him, asking him. 

00:59:30
MARCY I know. 

00:59:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And also, you tell me about the men who were, uh, kind to you. That... 

00:59:35
MARCY Before him? Before Miguel? 

00:59:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah and that, that you pushed away and, you know, you, you did a really good thing by coming here tonight because you said you were gonna start counseling and we need to help you get counseling and get support and get active support, um, on this. It's tremendously hard to leave these situations. What's the likelihood that you will be able to go? 

01:00:00
MARCY I don't know. Probably. I, I want to. 

01:00:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Part of you? What, what percent wants to? 

01:00:05
MARCY (crosstalk) I really do. 

01:00:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Is it 50/50 or are you riding the fence? 

01:00:05
MARCY (crosstalk) No. It's more that I want to. I need help. I know I do. 

01:00:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. It's more than 50/50? 

01:00:10
MARCY Oh yeah. It's, I know I need... 

01:00:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Except you're still there. 

01:00:15
MARCY I know that my boss is there for me. 

01:00:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:00:15
MARCY You know, she's saying, "At least you took a step to go to counseling today. At least you're taking steps instead of saying that you don't have nothing, no problems. 

01:00:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. So, you and Victor could move out into her upstairs apartment? 

01:00:25
MARCY If, yeah, I can, but the money. I mean... 

01:00:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what did she say about being late on payments? 

01:00:35
MARCY She said there'll, there's gonna be people there helping us out. 

01:00:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

01:00:35
MARCY She goes, "There's gonna always be, you know, people to, to be behind me if I leave him." She goes, "You don't know how many people really, that care about you. But they don't want to help you now because that you're with him." 

01:00:45
2-41 

01:00:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I guess you need to find out who those people are. 

01:00:50
MARCY Yeah. 

01:00:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you have any idea? 

01:00:55
MARCY She wants me to move in there, but she's scared that he's gonna show up there. 

01:00:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

01:00:55
MARCY She's scared too. She goes, "I can't have it." She goes, "I can't have him to, you know, come in there too" and it's hard on her too. 

01:01:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. I see. So you'd need to get a bond out. I mean, there are legal procedures you can take to keep him from coming. Did you know that? Did you? 

01:01:15
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. I don't want him to be away from his father. 

01:01:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You don't want Victor to be away from his father? So, that holds you back. 

01:01:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to keep him away. 

01:01:20
2-42 

01:01:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know this is, this is, um, not something we're going to be able to resolve right now, obviously. 

01:01:25
MARCY Yeah. 

01:01:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But there's this tremendous, uh, um, and, and dangerous thing you're doing, playing with your life this way, um, because you want Victor to have a father like you didn't. It's a huge price to pay, so what I want to do is, uh, see if we can put you in touch with, uh, a support network in the community and get you into counseling. But you need to leave your husband and get yourself safe as soon as possible and your son safe. I know you're nodding but that seems like an (inaudible ) 

01:02:07
MARCY (crosstalk) I understand. I mean, I know. 

01:02:07
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. What's this? We've got another minute or two. 

01:02:10
MARCY (crosstalk) It's been like this for years though. 

01:02:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

01:02:10
MARCY For years I've wanted to leave him. It just never happens. It's just being, it seems like the longer I'm with him, it's going to be harder for me. 

01:02:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. (crosstalk inaudible ) 

01:02:23
MARCY The people that are married for 10 years and then they're getting a divorce. I'm like, "How did you do it?" You know? Just... 

01:02:25
2-43 

01:02:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Well, you've gotten more and more beaten down each day. 

01:02:30
MARCY And you get, you believe in it. You believe it's a normal life. You'd be like, she goes, "Aren't you mad about him bruising you up?" 

01:02:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

01:02:35
MARCY I'm like,"I'm so used to it now, it's like just part of my normal life." It's part of my life, it is. 

01:02:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's outrageous what you're saying. 

01:02:45
MARCY It's not normal, but it's part of my day to day life, so. 

01:02:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) No. If I could wave a wand and get you out of there, I would do it. Um, it's painful to hear this and, and I do know how people get so psychologically beaten down, they can't leave and the longing for things to be good is so great. Uh, but you, you said you were scared when you heard my reaction. Let's, let's end by that. What is that? 

01:03:15
MARCY It's just that I've, I got deep problems, but I don't think they're that bad. I don't think they're as bad as people, other people view 'em to be. 

01:03:25
2-44 

01:03:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Yeah. Sounds like, you mean, I'm not following. You, you've... 

01:03:30
MARCY Like you and like all the people around me. How they see... 

01:03:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. I see. That we all see you have deep problems, but you don't feel it. 

01:03:35
MARCY And I think, yeah, I think of them as being, things will get better, you know. Things and, everybody tells me, "No they're not." But you just go, "Yeah, yeah." 

01:03:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:03:40
MARCY You just try to block out whatever they say. And, you know... 

01:03:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right. So you'll try to block out what I've said too. Let's just be honest. I mean, you, you probably will, huh? 

01:03:50
MARCY (crosstalk) I understand. No, I understand you're right, but it doesn't mean that I'm going to go home right now and go, "Okay. We're done." 

01:03:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. No. 

01:03:55
MARCY It's not easy like that. I understand that I'm wrong for being in that predicament. But I just do it because it's, it's just, it's scary to you know, to leave my, you know, take off like that. 

01:04:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Now there's so many fears. You don't know your supports. Um, you're going to need a whole support network to get out of there. And there's a part, there's something you're doing that's creating an illusion over and over about it'll be okay, uh, my son needs a father. 

01:04:25
MARCY Yeah. (inaudible ) change. 

01:04:28
2-45 

01:04:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh, and you get, mm-hmm, right. When you've then, you've heard that there's not going to be a change. And you've also said, your son doesn't need a father like that. You would never need a father like that. So, so this illusion you're creating is holding you in there. 

01:04:40
MARCY (crosstalk) It's wrong. And it's wrong. 

01:04:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And it's what? 

01:04:45
MARCY It's a wrong illusion. 

01:04:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. It's a mistake and I mean... 

01:04:45
MARCY It is. 

01:04:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's part of your strength. I bet as a young girl, you were optimistic, and you looked at the bright side, and you may do, you know, probably the same things now are working against you. 

01:04:55
MARCY I say well, he does these things good. 

01:04:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:05:00
MARCY He does his good to me. He's really good to his son. Yesterday, he bought his kid this. 

01:05:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, you're looking on the bright side. 

01:05:00
MARCY (crosstalk) You know, he cares. 

01:05:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And this is a time when you need not to look on the bright side. 

01:05:05
MARCY Yeah. Sometimes I get mad at him and... 

01:05:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But can you see it's a lot of strength to do that, but this strength now is working against you. 

01:05:10
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:05:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What? 

01:05:25
MARCY Nothing. 

01:05:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What were you thinking just then? 

01:05:25
2-46 

01:05:25
MARCY Just it's true though. I think of all the good things he does and then when we get into a fight, I'm like, "I'm gonna leave him. I'm gonna leave him." And then when I leave him for a couple weeks, it's like, "Nobody's this good. He really cares. He's, he's not that bad." And then I fall back in the trap. 

01:05:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

01:05:40
MARCY Like on my son's first birthday, he kicked me and my son out not knowing that it was his birthday. Then he called me that night. He's like, "I want you guys home." I'm like, "No. I'm not coming back. You kicked me out on his birthday." It's like, "You're not gonna see him." And I know it hurt him and he goes, "You don't understand how much it hurt me. I'd sit there and with my, and watch my son's pictures." 

01:06:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Wait. Your husband is saying to you, "You don't understand how much it hurts me." What about beating you? 

01:06:05
MARCY (crosstalk) He cares about his son. He doesn't care about me, just like I don't care about him. It's the same way. We don't care about each other. And, I mean, we could, he could tell you the same thing. I don't love him. He doesn't love me. And we, we established that, but we just don't, he doesn't want Victor to be without him either. And he goes, "The courts going to give you the kid and not me." I'm like, "You're right." I was like, "You're right." I was like, "I'm the mother." 

01:06:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:06:30
MARCY I never did nothing wrong for them, them not to. I don't do nothing, no drugs or nothing. They can't take my kid away from me. I'm a great mom. 

01:06:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:06:40
MARCY But it just, it's, both of us... 

01:06:45
2-47 

01:06:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so, the thing I'm hearing over and over and over is, "I can't take Victor away from his father." That's one of the main pulls, as though that were something sacred and yet I've asked you to look at your mother. 

01:07:00
MARCY (crosstalk) You're right. 

01:07:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What, what if she had stayed with, you know, what if your father lived in an abusive relationship with your mother? 

01:07:05
MARCY Yeah. 

01:07:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And you're acting as though that was good for Victor. Do you know the damage that does to a child? 

01:07:10
MARCY (crosstalk) It's not good. I know it's not good. 

01:07:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, this illusion again, which is looking on the bright side. 

01:07:15
MARCY (crosstalk) It's awful. I mean, I don't want this for him. (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:07:19
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's a mistaken illusion that Victor needs his father. 

01:07:20
MARCY (crosstalk) And if I really love my son as much as I say, I should just leave, like, you know. 

01:07:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

01:07:25
MARCY And, but, I mean, everybody tells me. It's not as easy as people think it is. It's not as easy. I can't do it on my own. It's just, it's hard. 

01:07:30
2-48 

01:07:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. It is hard and you're gonna need a lot of help. But you, you said something important just now. If you love your son as much as you say you do, you ought to leave. Now, well, we just have a minute left. Yeah. If you love your son as much as you say you do. 

01:08:00
MARCY I do. I mean, it's just, it, it's just a lot of, it's a lot of, um, saving up and, you know, just doing it, you know, saving up before I move out. 

01:08:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Or finding support, uh, so you can move out as soon as possible. 

01:08:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. You know, like (crosstalk inaudible ) 

01:08:24
2-49 

01:08:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH As, as we close, I want to say, my personal recommendation is for you to get out as soon as possible. I want to go on record as saying that. Uh, this is a dangerous situation. It should not continue and I'm going to ask for you to get support when we leave here. Um, and I also know how hard it is to go and it, it pains me greatly to see what you're going through. And I know how stuck women in your situation are. So, you shouldn't blame yourself. How is it to hear that? 

01:09:00
MARCY I don't know. It's easier to say like, "I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving." But it's so hard to do it. 

01:09:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Sure. Sure. 

01:09:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's a lot of fears facing you. Yeah. 

01:09:25
2-50 

01:09:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What's the hardest thing right now? 

01:09:35
MARCY Is I know I'm doing wrong. 

01:09:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know you're doing wrong by staying. Yeah. Well, maybe that's a place to hang onto 'cuz you haven't known that. I mean, all through this talk you've said, you feel like you're, you know, doing right things, you're giving your son a father, you're trying to keep the marriage together, but maybe if you can remember that what you're doing isn't good for you or your son, maybe that'll help. Do you think? 

01:10:10
MARCY Yeah. 

01:10:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Okay. 

01:10:15
3-1 

01:10:15
JON CARLSON Leigh, that was a powerful example of human emotion. Is this a good example of your strategy of brief therapy? 

01:10:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, it is in part, but there are really two components of this session because this is, um, also crisis intervention. 

01:10:35
JON CARLSON Oh yeah. 

01:10:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH There's a very dangerous situation going on, so I'm even more active and involved than I would be normally. 

01:10:40
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:10:45
JON CARLSON Let's take a look at one of the segments in which you, uh, provide some important feedback to the client. 

01:10:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Okay. And, and, um, I want to point out that we're starting in, in minute 15 for the first 15 minutes, I've been formulating, um, asking questions and so forth. And now I start confronting her and, in fact, do this for the next 15 minutes. And we'll see several segments of me confronting, using myself as my involvement, my feelings as a way to confront her. 

01:11:10
3-2 

01:11:10
JON CARLSON Now let's watch how this evolves. 

01:11:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:11:15
MARCY My son... 

01:11:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Sure. 

01:11:15
MARCY And there's nothing... 

01:11:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) You'll do anything for your son. 

01:11:15
MARCY Yes, I will and I'm trying to get out of there. 

01:11:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but what is your son going to do if he's, if he's left only with your, your husband? 

01:11:25
MARCY Yeah. 

01:11:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You said he was hitting you so much in the head that you didn't know if you were going to wake up. 

01:11:30
MARCY Yeah, it happens a lot. I mean... 

01:11:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That happens a lot. Where you don't know if you're going to live... 

01:11:35
MARCY (crosstalk) He has a black belt in karate. I mean, there's no way I can protect myself from him. Not at all. 

01:11:40
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 3-2 

01:11:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, that's, this is hard for me to hear. That's, you know and I'm in the business of listening to painful stories. Uh, what is it like for you hearing that from me? 

01:11:55
MARCY It's scary. 

01:11:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's scary? 

01:11:55
MARCY Yeah. 

01:12:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. What's scary about it? 

01:12:00
MARCY That, I don't know, maybe, I know I should like leave him. And I know everybody is saying to leave him. 

01:12:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

01:12:05
MARCY But nobody's in my shoes to say, "Just get up and go." You know, it's, it's impossible just to get up and go. 

01:12:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

01:12:10
MARCY I mean, nobody thinks, I don't like my son to see what ha-, what goes on. I just have to deal with it until I can make my own money. 

01:12:20
3-3 

01:12:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. You said, let me go back. You said it was scary. My reaction is so painful for me to hear is scary. 

01:12:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Oh yeah. Yes. Uh-huh. 

01:12:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) It tells you something. 

01:12:30
MARCY That I have a problem. Yeah. 

01:12:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. That, that really bad things are going on and that you're in a lot of danger. 

01:12:35
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. But sometimes it's, sometimes he can be great to me. 

01:12:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:12:40
MARCY Sometimes for two or three weeks, we can be like excellent. 

01:12:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, but look at the... 

01:12:40
MARCY Then one day, just... 

01:12:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But look at the price you're paying for," sometimes it can be great." 

01:12:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Yeah. 

01:12:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You see? You don't have to pay that high a price. 

01:12:50
MARCY He cried once when he hit me and that's when I was pregnant and he punched me in the face and my nose... 

01:12:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Right. Let's, why don't we stop right here because she's, um, beginning to go off into a lot of dissociative talking. Um, I'm struck by, um, watching the tape and seeing how fast she was talking while during the session, I was just racing to keep up and so forth. 

01:13:10
3-4 

01:13:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:13:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Um, and... 

01:13:10
JON CARLSON She's frenetic. This whole piece of this interview. 

01:13:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. Yeah, yeah. And this, uh, keeps her from feeling deeply, uh, the, the pace at which she's talking. Now, in my normal therapy approach, if there was, wasn't a crisis pending, I'd want to spend time just slowing her down during the first session. Uh, now, um, there's so much else that has to be dealt with, that to do this would take a huge portion of the session time so I, I chose not to. Um, but . . . 

01:13:45
JON CARLSON And this rapid talk, from your position, is a defense mechanism. 

01:13:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, absolutely. 

01:13:50
DIANE KJOS And this sort of skipping around. 

01:13:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:13:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:13:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right and it's notable because I say to her, "Look, uh, it's a huge price you're paying", and she cuts me right off and goes on talking. It's too painful for her to bear that. 

01:14:00
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk inaudible ). Yes. Yeah. 

01:14:01
JON CARLSON Let's watch this next segment where we actually begin to see some changes in Marcy's presentation. 

01:14:05
3-5 

01:14:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH To try to hurt, but, but he's using physical violence and there's no excuse for that and you keep, you keep saying that there's some excuse for what he's done to you. Some part of you knows that's not true. 

01:14:20
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. I feel that I shouldn't provoke him. I could, you know, I could change it a lot. I could stop him from hitting me most of the time by just him, if he calls me a name or something, just go, okay, okay, you know, instead of fighting him back going, "No, I'm not" you know and screaming back. 

01:14:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. How, and so let's go to that. If he called you a name and you shrugged, how would it be living in that situation? 

01:14:45
MARCY I don't want, I don't want to live in there either way. I wouldn't want to live in there. 

01:14:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right, um, but what is the way that's going to make you blame yourself less? 

01:14:55
MARCY I might, myself leaving there and just doing it on my own. 

01:15:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right, right. I guess what I was thinking is, um, again you keep saying if I could just not provoke him. 

01:15:00
3-6 

01:15:05
MARCY Just until I get enough saved up to leave him. You know, and just for us to have an understanding that we're not, we don't belong together. And I just wish he would understand that we don't belong together 'cuz we really don't. 

01:15:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why is it that you, you need him to understand? Why do you think he will understand? 

01:15:20
MARCY (crosstalk) 'Cuz I, 'cuz in order to be a mutual divorce, I don't want to fight over nothing. I just... 

01:15:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) I see. 

01:15:25
MARCY (crosstalk) I'm just tired of fighting. 

01:15:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That's a magical thinking. You've got a man who, you know, is going to, you know, is punching you in the face. 

01:15:35
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah, I know. Wishful thinking, yeah. 

01:15:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH It's magical thinking that there is going to be some, uh, uh, reasonable divorce here. You're, you're wishing for something that's clearly not going to happen. 

01:15:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. 

01:15:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. How does that make you feel? 

01:15:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Let's stop it right there. Um, during the segment which is just a couple minutes long, I've confronted her four times. Uh, on excuses, on, uh, blaming herself, on how it would be to just shrug things off and this last one, um, the magical thinking seemed to sink in. 

01:16:05
3-7 

01:16:05
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. She even changed it to wishful. 

01:16:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh, she... Yeah, she added something to that and then she became silent rather than jumping in to speak, so it's a clue that I might be making some impact, though small, at this point. 

01:16:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, so there's less of that dissociation. She's actually there and she smiled with that. 

01:16:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

01:16:25
DIANE KJOS It's like, "You got me." 

01:16:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

01:16:30
JON CARLSON In this next segment, we're gonna hear Marcy blaming herself and expressing powerlessness. 

01:16:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And, and I will be confronting that blaming again and again. And you'll hear me stop her abruptly when she starts chattering. Now I have a choice there. I could either point out to her, "Do you see how you are rushing to the talking", which I would normally do. 

01:16:50
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

01:16:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH But in this case, I just want to work on the crisis, so I, I confront the defense and move right into the issue. 

01:17:00
MARCY He goes, "See, all the men in there were doing the same thing. All the women have to talk. That's why they get hit and they think it's our fault." I mean, it's just... 

01:17:05
3-8 

01:17:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And you're one of these women who, you blame yourself? 

01:17:10
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:17:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH How much do you really blame yourself? 

01:17:15
MARCY I blame myself because I think I can control my anger by screaming at him a lot. I think I could be a little bit calmer. 

01:17:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

01:17:20
MARCY But I mean, I've always, you know, like I get really frustrated when I'm constantly cleaning and cooking, cleaning and cooking and I come home . . . Like I come home today, the house will be all... 

01:17:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) You know, anybody who's living in this amount of tension is frustrated and when you're frustrated, you feel like exploding. So, you're blaming yourself for exploding. Yes, it is wiser for you to shrug it off, but I don't know how much a normal human being can take. And the answer is to walk out. 

01:17:50
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. Like I ask him about his money... 

01:17:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now let me stop you. You went quickly away. 

01:17:55
MARCY I'm sorry. 

01:17:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, that's all right. I just, just this is an important, uh, point here. You said, you've asked him, "Why don't you just walk out?" 

01:18:05
3-9 

01:18:05
MARCY Uh-huh. 

01:18:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know, which is what a mature man does before he hits somebody. But also, um, and, and it's understandable people get angry. They lose their temper, but what about you just removing yourself? 

01:18:15
MARCY I can't. He won't let me. 

01:18:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. You can't? He won't let you leave? 

01:18:20
MARCY He blocks the door. I try all the time. 

01:18:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I see. So you try to get away... 

01:18:25
MARCY (crosstalk) When I try to go to the other room and just leave him alone, he believes like I'm arguing with him in the bathroom. 

01:18:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, so am I hearing that you're, you're blaming yourself for exploding when you're trying to get away, he's blocking the door, he, he continues at you and we all have a limit. So, you're blaming yourself. 

01:18:40
MARCY Not for that, no. 

01:18:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH No, not for that. 

01:18:45
MARCY You're right. Yeah. 

01:18:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Now, here's a place where after some repeated confrontations, she agrees with me, but more importantly, uh, she doesn't rush into the really fast talking again. She's reflecting on it a little bit. Um, I'm not expecting to remove this defense of blaming. I'm just trying to give her some distance on it. 

01:19:10
3-10 

01:19:15
DIANE KJOS Were you, were you feeling a bit frustrated at that point? 

01:19:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I'm building, uh, here, and I, I notice I'm reining myself in. 

01:19:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Okay. 

01:19:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I'm feeling quite upset as I, uh, watch it and as I was doing it. 

01:19:25
DIANE KJOS Okay. Yeah. 

01:19:25
JON CARLSON It seemed like you were doing some teaching too. 

01:19:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. 

01:19:25
JON CARLSON You were really trying to tell her what life is like. 

01:19:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Presenting reality and I was trying to choose my words rapidly at that moment. Uh, we all get frustrated. I was in a dilemma about, um, she, uh, whether to strongly go after her not provoking him. That was even hard to conceptualize versus leaving. 

01:19:45
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

01:19:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And both needed to be worked on because she, if she's going to stay, she needs to, um, dodge the assaultive, uh, episodes. But that was a dilemma in my mind working this quickly in this short of time frame. 

01:20:00
DIANE KJOS And then having her just go on and on. 

01:20:05
3-11 

01:20:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, and rush on with, uh, the rapid speeches. 

01:20:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:20:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Difficult to formulate when, uh, all the complexity of the session at once. 

01:20:15
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:20:15
JON CARLSON In this next segment, let's look at the price that Marcy pays. 

01:20:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, that's part of it, but there's, there's also my growing alarm that I was trying to deal with and it's very common for me in the kind of therapy I do to intensify or, vivify, make more vivid the feeling. Well, here you hear blurt out of my mouth that he might kill you because she's told me, she's been beaten until she doesn't think she's going to wake up. 

01:20:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:20:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH She blacks out. It's very serious. And I use that as a confrontation. I use the huge process confrontation and then what I do is move to her longing. I'm trying to get to what is the adaptive feeling underneath this defensiveness. Um, I use the term longing and in this case, it's defensive longing. She's much too longing for this man, but were there any cases in her life, I asked, where she had appropriate or more healthy, um, uh, relationships. 

01:21:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Right. 

01:21:15
DIANE KJOS So, let's watch. 

01:21:15
3-12 

01:21:15
MARCY My son loves him dearly and I mean, he does, he loves him too. I mean, we have our problems, but... 

01:21:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now, okay, let me go into that one. You don't think you should just leave and get you and your son away from him even though he might kill you? 

01:21:30
MARCY No. 

01:21:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you, do you, what do you think about that? Even though he has beaten you to... 

01:21:40
MARCY (crosstalk) It's scary because I, I feel like leaving him and then the next day things are fine and normal again. Every time, I mean... 

01:21:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So you pay, you pay a huge price for that little bit of normal time. 

01:21:45
MARCY Yeah. 

01:21:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Which isn't normal because he's not being a full partner and he's not helping, but just because he's calm, then you are.... 

01:21:55
MARCY Get back into that. Yeah, I do. 

01:21:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. You'll be seduced back in, the longing is so great. Am I right? The longing... 

01:22:05
MARCY (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. It is. It's, it's great to get along with him. You know, us be a family and going somewhere to the park together and not fighting. You know? 

01:22:10
3-13 

01:22:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Have you ever had a boyfriend that treated you kindly? 

01:22:15
MARCY Shit, I used to, (inaudible ) like, I used to dump guys a lot. I used to, I used dump guys for wearing squared boots. 

01:22:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

01:22:20
MARCY You know? I would dump guys for anything. 

01:22:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, I'm trying to do a whole lot in this very brief segment, um, but I'm guiding her toward what might be more appropriate behavior to see what kind of pull she has. And the tragic truth is that she says I used to dump the guys that were, um, nice to me. 

01:22:40
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:22:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

01:22:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, what I wasn't aware of then and only became aware of at the end of the session is and I've written about it. This is addictive attachment. Her, all she knows of love is the person she needs to reach for, ache for, long for. That's, longing is love to her. 

01:22:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Long for. 

01:22:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH  Healthy give and take, uh, seems very foreign to her and she had to dismiss it. 

01:23:05
3-14 

01:23:05
DIANE KJOS I was concerned too that she really dismissed your, um, you know, your concern about the threat. 

01:23:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes, yes. 

01:23:10
DIANE KJOS It was just sort of like going to the park. 

01:23:10
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 

01:23:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk inaudible ) Yes, I was like one of the boyfriends, uh, to be dismissed. 

01:23:15
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yes. Yeah. 

01:23:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And I've often confronted that in a session and stayed with that. It might've been really good to do that right then and stop her. 

01:23:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:23:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH  I stop her a little bit, but, uh, not nearly enough, I think. 

01:23:25
JON CARLSON In this next segment, there was an awful lot going on and it seemed like you got to her on a couple of different occasions, especially the part about her not having a father. 

01:23:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Um, I was intrigued, uh, in watching it that, uh, what I did was not only confront this time, but, but the main part of my treatment which is anxiety regulation. I said, I was trying to help bring down her terror of possibly leaving. 

01:23:55
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:23:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so I asked her, "What's the worst part of this" and, and "Could you face doing this" and so forth and after doing that twice, she has a, a welling up of grief. And, um, it's a, it's a small breakthrough and she links it to her past. 

01:24:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:24:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH She didn't have a father. 

01:24:10
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:24:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, there we know, uh, probably it's the main, uh, linchpin holding, holding this defensive pattern in. 

01:24:20
3-15 

01:24:20
DIANE KJOS Okay. So, something that you would remember later on if you were working with her in a future session? 

01:24:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Absolutely. Yes. 

01:24:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:24:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Issue right now tonight, and it's a serious issue, is how to help you move out of that house and you're saying you don't want to, um, you don't... 

01:24:40
MARCY (crosstalk) I want him to know where we are. I do. I want him to know where we are. 

01:24:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Why? 

01:24:45
MARCY (crosstalk) For him to see my son. 

01:24:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Where's your, you want him to see your son. That's so important. That's more important than your son having a mother. 

01:24:50
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. No, it's not. I think, you know, I want him to be with me too. I, you know, it's, it's just wishing that things could be okay for him. You know, for me and him to be together. I just wish that it could, I know... 

01:25:00
3-16 

01:25:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Again there's the magical thinking, isn't it? 

01:25:05
MARCY So there is, you don't think there's no hope of him getting better? 

01:25:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What do you think? 

01:25:10
MARCY If he gets counseling. 

01:25:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) What do you think? 

01:25:10
MARCY I think if he can get counseling, maybe, you know, it'll help, you know, knowing that's he's got problems too. 

01:25:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, you've watched the talk shows, you said. What do they say about the husbands who, uh, beat up their wife? 

01:25:15
MARCY (crosstalk) Once you get hit, it always happens. 

01:25:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, once you get hit, it always happens. Right? It escalates. Right? 

01:25:25
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

01:25:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, that's information you're not wanting to listen to? 

01:25:30
MARCY I know. 

01:25:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. Is that really painful to face? That once you get hit, it always happens. 

01:25:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What's the worst part of that? 

01:25:55
MARCY My kid not having a father. 

01:25:55
3-17 

01:25:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Victor won't have a father. What, what's, what's the worst part of that? 

01:26:10
MARCY I never had a father. 

01:26:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You didn't have a father. I see. And you not wanting to put your son in the same place. Your mother never remarried? 

01:26:25
MARCY Uh-uh. 

01:26:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Do you think it's going to be like that with you? 

01:26:25
MARCY No, I don't care about me remarrying. 

01:26:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. So, right now, this is an important, um, break that she's made. Um, and I was forceful in this. And I think more forceful than I, I might've been. I might've been more measured, um, in, in, especially in regard to the husband who's hitting and saying it always continues. I'm, I'm, I'm being much too heavy on the negative side, um, trying to impact on her. Obviously, men get treated and get help. The, uh, the point I wish I had said or I could've said it better is that while the hitting is going on, um, the, the thing to, the, the thing she needs to do is leave. And then if he, if he gets treatment and gets help, fine she can see if he gets it under control, but, uh, that this isn't something to, uh, live through. 

01:27:15
3-18 

01:27:15
DIANE KJOS And part of her magical thinking is that, that he will just miraculously be cured of this if he gets counseling. 

01:27:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then it will go away quickly. 

01:27:25
DIANE KJOS Yeah. And the question is, would he get counseling? 

01:27:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. And if he did, how quickly could it go away? 

01:27:30
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:27:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, um, that might've been a better way to present reality to her. Um, there's a, a point I want to make here that I'm repeating. You'll hear I've said magical thinking. This is the fourth or maybe fifth time in the whole interview. 

01:27:45
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

01:27:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Um, uh, and uh, I'm asking her to stay with the painful feelings and she does slow down and doesn't go to the rapid chatter. Without, without my confronting that defense a whole lot, the affect work is just naturally bringing her closer to what is going on underneath. 

01:28:05
3-19 

01:28:05
JON CARLSON Again in this next segment, you're going to talk about the too high a price that she has to pay for a father figure. 

01:28:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, I do that in part, but then, um, in another part, I go to the benefits of the defenses because it's clear that, uh, just the costs alone are not going to help dislodge this strong pattern. And I try to go to where she is and bring her back, uh, try to empathize with why she would hang on to this destructive pattern. 

01:28:35
JON CARLSON Yeah and she talks also about how she had so little to look forward to in this segment. 

01:28:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. You don't want your son to miss out on the same thing, but you're paying too high a price for a father figure. 

01:28:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:28:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What if your father had lived and you watched him beat up your mother? What, what good would that have done even if he were good to you? Have you thought about that? If you didn't know if your mother was going to live or die. If you... 

01:29:00
3-20 

01:29:05
MARCY (crosstalk) That would be even more scary than him leaving. Yeah. 

01:29:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What would you want your mother to do? 

01:29:05
MARCY Leave. 

01:29:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. And that's what my family, a lot, blame it on her and says, "You know what, you could've left dad. We would've lived a normal life." 

01:29:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. And here it is again and what I hear you saying over all, and it's understandable. You, you so long for the marriage to work. You so long for it and you think if you could just calm down, it would be normal. Uh, but remember what you've heard once they start hitting, the hitting continues. So, whether you provoke or say something or not, there's not any insurance here that he's not going to be in a bad mood. So you've got this longing that things are going to be, uh, reasonable, but it's what I call magical thinking. It's an illusion. 

01:29:50
MARCY Mm-hmm. 

01:29:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Those are my words. Can you, do you believe me? Do you feel that? 

01:29:50
MARCY You're right. You are absolutely right. It's hard not to believe that way. I mean, I don't have nothing to look forward to, you know. 

01:30:00
3-21 

01:30:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. You have nothing to look forward to. 

01:30:00
MARCY (crosstalk) And that looks, I, I look forward to, you know, okay, we're going to go out today and there's not gonna be no fighting. 

01:30:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Uh-huh. 

01:30:05
MARCY And like me coming, like, coming home one night like... 

01:30:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH There are several points I'd like to, uh, make about this segment. Um, I've already said I worked on both sides of the fence. There's the cost and the benefits. And there's a transition in there. When I said, well those are my words, so I'm confronting the defense and I know that she is not going to just give it up by looking at the costs, so I ask her how much she's able to agree with, uh, what I'm saying. Now she says, in, on an intellectual level, "You're right." But, uh, then we go into, you know, what other factors might be holding her because she's not going to be able to do it, um, so easily. I'd also like to point out the enormous repetition. I'm saying the same thing over and over again. And I, and, and my students often say, "Oh, don't make me say that again." You know, but my rationale is, if a person has been doing the same thing thousands and thousands of times in their daily life over months or years, uh, only one or two repetitions is not going to, um... 

01:31:10
3-22 

01:31:15
JON CARLSON Break that pattern. 

01:31:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Make them break that pattern. 

01:31:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:31:15
DIANE KJOS There's such, there's such pain and such longing that she, that she has this, um... 

01:31:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. That's the, that's the reinforcing quality of these defenses. 

01:31:25
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:31:30
JON CARLSON As you move on in the interview, you want to talk about her fears and to bring these out, but also it seemed like some of your own fears were coming out too. 

01:31:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH That's so true. Um, I was aware that I had only a few minutes remaining in the session and I was consciously thinking, what can I do in the last few minutes to make the most impact. And, and from the clinical research I've done, um, focusing on fears is, is the most helpful at, of dislodging things but, as you mentioned, uh, my saying beating her senseless, uh, I was quite concerned and, and worried and I was using intense language to try to reach her. 

01:32:05
3-23 

01:32:05
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:32:10
MARCY It's scary too. It is. It's... 

01:32:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. Well, let's go through as many of the fears as we can. 'Cuz you're saying you're gonna have, she's saying you're gonna have so much support. 

01:32:20
MARCY How do we know that for sure though? I mean... 

01:32:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh-huh. 

01:32:20
MARCY People say that and then, you know, turn their back on you when you need it. 

01:32:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Well. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Do you think she would? 

01:32:25
MARCY No, I know she wouldn't, but I mean.. 

01:32:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Okay. She wouldn't. 

01:32:30
MARCY Who knows where I can, what happens if I run out of, you know what I mean, I don't have no money for food or something? I don't wanna depend on nobody. 

01:32:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) What happens, what happens if you get beaten senseless? 

01:32:40
MARCY Yeah. 

01:32:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH See that issue? So, here's the way you're thinking now, saying this, there are a lot of financial fears, which is understandable. And, and before this, I mean, when this session is over, I'm going to ask about community supports and try to find out who knows and can try to put you in touch with this 'cuz it's serious. This is really serious what's going on with you. Um, but um, there's a, some sense that, uh, he's, uh, providing so much financial support. Well, for one thing, if you separate and go to court, he has to give you some child support money. 

01:33:10
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:33:10
3-24 

01:33:10
DIANE KJOS At this point, I, I get the sense that for her the known, that is being beaten, is almost safer than going off to the unknown and she really puts up a whole bunch of fear barriers about that. 

01:33:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Right. Yes. 

01:33:30
DIANE KJOS That it's probably better to just stay here and take it. 

01:33:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. The, the negative attention is better than no attention at all, than the anguish of, of the neglect she must have experienced growing up. 

01:33:40
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. And that she fears if she leaves him. Yeah. 

01:33:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. And in fact, this segment, as involved as I am and obviously caring, is nonetheless an empathic failure because I'm saying, "You're being beaten senseless. Isn't this horrible." "No." I think in her relative, uh, value system, he's attending to her. 

01:34:00
3-25 

01:34:00
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:34:05
JON CARLSON Strange form of caring. 

01:34:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. Yes, I think that's, I missed that and, and, I don't know, in the few minutes I had left if I could've gone into that, but it would be something to follow up on, absolutely. And it might impact on her very strongly. 

01:34:20
DIANE KJOS The other piece though is she has this dream of him putting his arm around her. 

01:34:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. Yes. That's the illusion that, you know, holds her in as well. 

01:34:25
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:34:25
JON CARLSON Magical thinking. 

01:34:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. Yes. 

01:34:30
JON CARLSON In this next piece, you look at her mistaken illusion and seem to hit home. 

01:34:35
DIANE KJOS And, and just before this piece, she makes a comment about wanting to leave him and then says, "But it never happens," as if somehow magically she would leave. 

01:34:45
3-26 

01:34:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right. And so, I keep confronting the, the magical thinking and the illusion. 

01:34:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:34:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, right. When you've been, you've heard that there's not going to be a change. And you've also said, your son doesn't need a father like that. You would never need a father like that. So, so this illusion you're creating is holding you in there. 

01:35:05
MARCY (crosstalk) It's wrong. And it's wrong. 

01:35:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And itt's what? 

01:35:10
MARCY It's a wrong illusion. 

01:35:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. It's a mistake and I mean, it's part of your strength. 

01:35:10
MARCY (crosstalk) It is. 

01:35:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I bet as a young girl, you were optimistic, and you looked at the bright side, and you may do, you know, probably the same things now are working against you. 

01:35:20
MARCY I say well, he does these things good. 

01:35:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:35:25
MARCY He does his good to me. He's really good to his son. Yesterday, he bought his kid this. 

01:35:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, you're looking on the bright side. 

01:35:25
MARCY (crosstalk) He really cares. 

01:35:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And this is a time when you need not to look on the bright side. 

01:35:30
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Sometimes I get mad at him and... 

01:35:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Wait. Can you say it's a lot of strength to do that, but this strength now is working against you. 

01:35:40
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:35:40
3-27 

01:35:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Now there's something very important that I'm doing here that I, I found out inadvertently while watching the video tapes. And that is just as she starts owning this part of herself that creates an illusion and says it's wrong, I rush in with a supportive statement to say, "But this is a strength in you. That you're looking on the bright side." 

01:36:00
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:36:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And the value of that is to reduce the shame. This is a part of anxiety regulation. Part of it. I, I want her to be able to face this part of herself as not a bad part, but a, but as a, as a part she used to cope with an unbearable situation and that, uh, if she saw it as somehow not so, uh, aversive or, or shameful, she might really reflect on it. Um, and, and we've seen that in many cases in many patients. 

01:36:25
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

01:36:25
DIANE KJOS So a part too that she could use it another time in a useful way, knowing that it could be seen as a strength. 

01:36:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

01:36:35
JON CARLSON It could work for her. 

01:36:35
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:36:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes. Absolutely. 

01:36:40
JON CARLSON Here we see you begin this segment by looking at and confronting some of her core beliefs about not wanting to take Victor away from his father. 

01:36:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah, as the session comes to an end, I'm trying to go to the, um, most salient, um, uh, thing that seems to hold her in there. 

01:36:55
3-28 

01:37:00
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:37:05
MARCY "I'm the mother." It's, I, I never did nothing wrong for them, them not to. I don't do nothing, no drugs or nothing. They can't take my kid away from me. I'm a great mom. 

01:37:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:37:10
MARCY But it's just, it's, our relationship... 

01:37:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) And so, the thing I'm hearing over and over and over is, "I can't take Victor away from his father." That's one of the main pulls as though that were something sacred and yet I've asked you to look at your mother. At what, what if she had stayed with, you know, what if your father lived in an abusive relationship with your mother? 

01:37:40
MARCY Yeah. 

01:37:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And you're acting as though that was good for Victor. Do you know the damage that does to a child? 

01:37:45
MARCY (crosstalk) It's not good. I know it's not good. 

01:37:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH So, this illusion again, which is looking on the bright side. 

01:37:45
MARCY (crosstalk) It's awful. I mean, I don't want this for him. It's like... 

01:37:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) It's a mistaken illusion that Victor needs his father. 

01:37:50
MARCY And if I really love my son as much as I say, I should just leave, like, you know. 

01:37:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. 

01:37:55
MARCY And, but, I mean, everybody tells me, it's not as easy as people think it is. It's not as easy. I can't do it on my own. It's just, it's hard. 

01:38:00
3-29 

01:38:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yeah. It is hard and you're gonna need a lot of help. Yeah. But you, but you said something important just now. If you love your son as much as you say you do, you ought to leave. Now. Well, we just have a minute left. 

01:38:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Well, there's several things going on here and, uh, I'm still working on the negative side rather than going to, uh, uh, why all the reasons why she might want to stay. Um, I use, um, a strategy called changing perspectives and, uh, how it would be if you, you know, if your mother had done this and so forth. And it's not a dramatic intervention, but it's one that is like planting a seed and over time, uh, it'll cause someone to reflect and possibly drive a wedge under. I'm actually surprised to see how, how much she is, uh, thinking about changing, uh, the perspective. She does say, uh, you know, "if I love my son as much as I say I do," so I think that's a, uh, a, a hopeful sign. 

01:39:10
3-30 

01:39:10
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Yeah. You reinforced that too. 

01:39:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm, I did. 

01:39:15
DIANE KJOS Then she jumps back in with this defense of, "It would really be hard" and, and, um, uh, you know, "I'm, I'm not sure if I could do it" and it's almost it's better to be beaten than to be unsure. Uh, uh, the people say they'll help me, but I don't know that they will" and furthermore, he does need to have a father. She just hangs on to him. 

01:39:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Right. This is such an important point you've brought up, um, two times now. And it's the value of videotape review. It's how we learn, I think, to be better and better therapists. I didn't think of that while I was in the session. 

01:39:50
DIANE KJOS Okay. 

01:39:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I wish I had because I think it'd be very powerful right now, and would be the deepest form of empathy to just have her feel, "Oh my God, I'd rather be beaten than be alone" and how tragic that is. 

01:40:00
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah. 

01:40:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And that might be the strongest wedge that we could put, uh, to that pattern. 

01:40:05
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. 

01:40:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, it certainly is a place to go, uh, in further treatment. 

01:40:10
DIANE KJOS Yeah. Yeah. 

01:40:10
3-31 

01:40:10
JON CARLSON In this next segment, you're making it very clear that you think she needs to go and to get out of that house. 

01:40:20
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:40:20
JON CARLSON And a little further on, you made a comment that I thought was strange and, um, maybe you can talk about it. 

01:40:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

01:40:25
JON CARLSON In which you asked Marcy how it was for her to hear what you said. What was that about? 

01:40:30
LEIGH McCULLOUGH, Ph.D BRIEF CHARACTER CHANGE 

01:40:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. Well, let me respond to the first point and then I'll go to the second. Um, the session is coming to a close and I've, I've often said that I think a therapist has to become involved with the patient to change a personality disorder. Well, this is a crisis and a woman in physical danger and so, I feel like I have to bear witness. I, I choose to bear witness. I think this is not the time for therapist to be abstinent or maintain neutrality. And so, I take a, a strong stand. I, watching the tape, am very measured and, uh, in my words, but I feel it much more intensely inside. Now, why did I ask her? 

01:41:10
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

01:41:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh... 

01:41:10
3-32 

01:41:10
JON CARLSON "How is it to hear that?" 

01:41:10
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH How, how is it to hear that? Well, it's because a therapist can put a pill in the patient's mouth, but you don't know what, whether the patient's gonna swallow the pill or how much, uh, they'll absorb it into the system. I've said something very intense to her. Is she going to dismiss it or is she going to resonate with it? And so, one of the tools I use it to, uh, is to check her receptive capacity. How much is she receiving, resonating to, uh, my strong feeling? 

01:41:35
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:41:40
JON CARLSON Let's see it. 

01:41:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Or finding support, uh, so you can move out as soon as possible. 

01:41:45
MARCY (crosstalk) Yeah. Like, you know, like, (crosstalk inaudible ). 

01:41:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH As we close, I want to say, my personal recommendation is for you to get out as soon as possible. I want to go on record as saying that. 

01:41:55
MARCY (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

01:41:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Uh, this is a dangerous situation. It should not continue and I'm going to ask for you to get some support when we leave here. And, and I also know how hard it is to go and it, it, it pains me greatly to see what you're going through. And I know how stuck women in your situation are. So, you, you shouldn't blame yourself. How is it to hear that? 

01:42:20
3-33 

01:42:25
MARCY I don't know. 

01:42:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. 

01:42:25
MARCY It's easier to say like, "I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving." But it's so hard to do it. 

01:42:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Sure. Sure. So, you see why I have to ask? Because, as strongly as I was feeling, she can hear me intellectually, but she can't resonate yet emotionally and it's a barometer of the work that has to be done. 

01:42:50
JON CARLSON Well, you got an answer and it was, it was pretty loud, but in the next segment, we're going to see that you really did get through. 

01:43:00
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Mm-hmm. Well, maybe, in a little bit. Let's look at it then. 

01:43:05
3-34 

01:43:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH What's the hardest thing right now? 

01:43:15
MARCY It's I know I'm doing wrong. 

01:43:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH You know you're doing wrong by staying. Yeah. Well, maybe that's a place to hang onto 'cuz you haven't known that. I mean, all through this talk you've said you feel like you're, you know, keep, doing right things, you're giving your son a father, you're trying to keep the marriage together, but maybe if you can remember that what you're doing isn't good for you or your son, maybe that'll help. Do you think? 

01:43:45
MARCY Yeah. 

01:43:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Okay. 

01:43:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And I'm moved by this last segment, seeing it again, um, because she's quieted down considerable, since this session began. 

01:44:00
3-35 

01:44:05
JON CARLSON She sure has. 

01:44:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah. 

01:44:05
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And so, there is some hope that she might be taking in a little of that. Um, however, I'm, I'm well aware of the entrenchment of such defenses, so. 

01:44:15
JON CARLSON What happens next? I mean, there's, there's some immediate concerns that need to be taken care of and then, the long range therapeutic plan. 

01:44:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. 

01:44:25
JON CARLSON Can you talk about that? 

01:44:25
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Sure. Let me talk about the immediate, immediate concerns. 

01:44:30
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:44:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And also that I'm asked by therapists all over the country, "What do we do, it's, when we're working in managed care and we only have a few sessions with a person like this?" 

01:44:35
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:44:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH I know in our research project, we would have stacks of community resources, uh, books of different resources, names of different people, uh, to put patients in touch with or people we didn't take into the, the research project who were in crisis for example. And that's something that can be done and this was 45 minutes. We got an overview of the dynamic issues and the real life practical issues and after this session, if I were her therapist, I'd be on the phone, uh, to people in the community and connect her with one or two support groups, uh, a therapist, a minister, uh, something like that, uh, too. But, but more than one group of people. A family member who is supportive, uh, and I would be asking her this as, uh, the session closed. We, in fact, did talk about this, um, last night. 

01:45:25
3-36 

01:45:25
JON CARLSON Oh, oh, off the camera. 

01:45:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Yes, off the camera, uh, as she, as she left. And those processes are going to be... 

01:45:35
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. Okay. So, that takes care of kind of immediate safety issue. 

01:45:35
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yes. 

01:45:35
JON CARLSON Or at least you're going to address those. What does therapy look like in your brief model from this point? 

01:45:45
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Yeah. Right. Um, you know, I'm, I'm still struck by power of, uh, your interpretation that her, um, uh, need for attention, even negative attention is so great, so much greater than, uh, being alone, so much more painful to be alone. And I think I would work on that, uh, but following my model, I would want her to see her defenses and to understand her, uh, the feelings that she, the adaptive feelings she needs to incorporate which are, very simply, she needs to care for herself and look to, um, uh, more adaptive lifestyle, a more positive, uh, less abusive lifestyle. It's, it's not anything terribly complex. The complexity comes in dislodging the defenses and that's where, what I call anxiety regulation comes in, how to reduce her, uh, fear of leaving, her, but her, surely, pain and anguish about, uh, breaking up this, um, attachment she's got, however destructive it is. 

01:46:45
3-37 

01:46:45
DIANE KJOS You touched briefly on damage to the son in that relationship. 

01:46:50
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

01:46:50
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) And I would think that that would be another inroad in some. 

01:46:55
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. Yes. It is. I've seen it so often with, uh, young mothers and, and sometimes young fathers as well. When they're not able to care for themself, we'll acknowledge that. Right now, you don't care for yourself as much as you want and, you know, let's work toward that, but you, you care for your child and you love your child. And so sometimes that's the motivation and I say it straight out. 

01:47:15
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yeah. 

01:47:15
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH And we implied it again and again in here. 

01:47:20
3-38 

01:47:20
DIANE KJOS (crosstalk) Yes. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:47:20
JON CARLSON Thank you much for your, uh, insight and, uh, sensitivity with this, uh, challenging case. 

01:47:30
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Thank you. 

01:47:30
DIANE KJOS This is very, very moving and, case and I could see that it was, involved you more deeply. 

01:47:40
LEIGH MCCULLOUGH Tremendously so. 

01:47:40
DIANE KJOS Not one you're quickly forget. 

01:47:45
