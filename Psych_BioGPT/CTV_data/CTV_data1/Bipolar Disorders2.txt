MERLIN HUFF Can we take a trip? Will you go somewhere? It's been a long time since you've had a vacation. You want some coffee? 

00:00:15
HANNAH HUFF Umm… oh, I'm good. I'm good. 

00:00:15
MERLIN HUFF All right. Is that charged? 

00:00:20
HANNAH HUFF Yeah. Yeah. 

00:00:20
MERLIN HUFF You should keep it charged. You should always keep it charged. If the battery runs down too many times it will actually go (inaudible ). 

00:00:25
HANNAH HUFF Oh, great. 

00:00:25
MERLIN HUFF You're sure, you don't want some coffee?

SEAN HARRIGAN Recent studies have shown that our happiness and sense of wellbeing have as much to do with our approach to the world, as they do with external situations. Just as we are influenced by our circumstances, our thoughts, feelings, and mood, shape how we perceive those circumstances, affecting our sense of contentment. But what happens when our mood itself feels out of control, when it seems depressed, erratic, hijacked by chemical imbalance that feel impossible to manage? This is the experience faced by those with bipolar and related disorders, which are mental disorders characterized by abnormalities in an individual's mood. Mood is defined as the prolonged emotions that color a person's perceptions of the world. Within this category of mood disorders are two groups of disorders. These are depressive disorders, and bipolar and related disorders. Both groups of disorders involve abnormalities of mood. However, while depressive disorders are marked by major depressive episodes or symptoms characterized by low mood and loss of interest in usual activities, bipolar and related disorders feature manic or hypomanic episodes or symptoms, in which the individual has an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Bipolar and related disorders can be cyclical in nature, with the individual experiencing episodes of sorrow and depression, followed later by periods of excessive energy, potentially making their mood and thus their lives feel unpredictable and chaotic. 

00:02:15
DSM-5® AND ICD-10 CODING 

00:02:20
SEAN HARRIGAN The chapter on bipolar and related disorders grouping in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual disorders or DSM-5 contains a number of distinct disorders, each given its own diagnostic code. All DSM-5 codes crosswalk to the corresponding codes used by the World Health Organization in the International Classification of Diseases or ICD. In DSM-5, each disorder is first linked to the coding system from the ICD-9, with the codes for the ICD-10 listed in parentheses after. For instance, Bipolar I disorder with the current or most recent episode manic and of mild severity is assigned the code 296.41 from ICD-9 and F31.11 in parentheses from ICD-10. This is because the ICD-9 system was still in use in the United States when DSM-5 was first released. ICD-10 was adopted in the US in the fall of 2015. However, because ICD-10 was implemented in 2015, this program will be listing the newer code from the ICD-10 first, followed by the ICD-9 codes in parentheses. Bipolar disorder is often referred to in the literature as Bipolar Spectrum. Included in this spectrum are Bipolar I and II disorders. Bipolar I disorder contains four broad coding specifications, each of which is dependent upon the nature of the most recent episode. The codes can further be delineated by descriptors that indicate severity and the presence or absence of psychotic features. Further, additional specifiers can indicate if the disorder is in remission or if it is unspecified. Sometimes when relevant we will also delineate the ICD-9 and 10 codes when we mentioned a disorder from one of the other chapters of DSM-5. For example, to use one of the depressive disorders mentioned earlier in this program, Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Mild is coded as F32.0 (296.21), part of the F30 to F39 section of ICD-10 on mood affective disorders. Organizationally, there are some differences between the layouts of DSM-5 and ICD-10. ICD-10 contains a classification known as Bipolar Affective Disorder in their larger section on Mood Affective Disorders. This larger section on mood disorders is contained in the F30 to F39 block of ICD-10. In addition, many of the bipolar and depressive disorders that are separated in DSM-5 are lumped together in ICD-10. For example, Cyclothymia, which is listed as a Bipolar Related Disorder in DSM-5, and Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), previously known as dysthymic disorder are both placed in the F34 section of the ICD-10, for Persistent Mood Affective disorders. While the ICD-10 grouping of all mood disorders into one section may seem like a minor organizational difference, it speaks to the historical association of these disorders as mood disorders in DSM-IV-TR and affective disorders in DSM III. Two other differences between ICD-10 and DSM-5 are with substance or medication-induced bipolar disorder and bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. The ICD-10 puts what they call mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance abuse in the F10 block. And organic, including symptomatic mental disorders in F00 to F09. Specifically, F06 or other mental disorders due to brain damage and dysfunction and to physical disease. In this case, the code is F06.3 for Organic Mood Affective Disorder. We cover these organizational differences in greater detail in the first program of the series.

MOOD EPISODES 

00:06:55
SEAN HARRIGAN Most mood disorders are made up of specific mood episodes. A mood episode is a specific period of time where an individual feels abnormally energized and elevated, or depressed. The most recent episode the individual experienced affects the coding of the disorder. Beyond coding, an understanding of the type and frequency of mood disorders experienced by an individual patient is necessary in order to make an appropriate diagnosis. Because of this, we will first define each of the three mood episodes, manic, hypomanic, and major depressive. We will then explain the pattern by which these episodes present in specific mood disorders before exploring how the presence of these episodes can lead the caregiver to an overall diagnosis. 

00:07:50
MOOD EPISODES 

00:07:50
Manic 

00:07:55
SEAN HARRIGAN A manic episode is a required factor in making a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder, which we'll look at later in the program. The mood of an individual experiencing a manic episode is abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable. The patient may seem energetic and could have an intense fixation on a goal or other activity. These symptoms affect the individual for most of the day, nearly every day during the course of the episode. The individual may experience racing thoughts, a decreased need for sleep, overly increased self-esteem, distractibility, and excessive poor judgment regarding dangerous activities among other symptoms. The disturbance in mood is severe enough to either warrant hospitalization or to cause significant issues in social or professional settings In addition, a diagnosis of a manic episode is appropriate if the patient experiences psychotic features along with the above symptoms.

Hypomanic

JENNIFER SHAEVITZ The days are here again, mom has made super snacks again. So sing a song of cheer again, super snacks are here again. 

00:09:15
SEAN HARRIGAN A hypomanic episode is similar to a manic episode, but by definition, does not cause the same degree of functional impairment. Hypomanic episodes involve the same symptoms previously mentioned with manic episodes. However, a diagnosis for a hypomanic episode is met within a shorter duration of time than a manic episode. Similar to what was described for mania, the patient with hypomania experiences some of the characteristics described earlier, such as racing thoughts, increased energy, and involvement in risky behaviors. However, these symptoms are not severe enough to warrant hospitalization.

00:09:55
Major Depressive 

00:10:00
SEAN HARRIGAN While the diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder entails a major depressive episode, a major depressive is a common but not required feature of Bipolar I disorder. In addition, the presence of major depressive episodes in the absence of manic or hypomanic episodes can lead to a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, as we'll cover in greater detail in another program. A major depressive episode has a number of characteristic features, which take place most of the day, nearly every day, where relevant. The tow main characteristics are depressed mood and a noticeably decreased interest in most activities. Other characteristics include trouble sleeping, diminished hunger or pronounced weight loss, trouble concentrating or making decisions, fatigue or loss of energy, recurring suicidal thoughts with or without intent to act on these thoughts, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and feelings of low self-worth or pronounced guilt. These symptoms must cause marked distress in the individual's work or social life. For all of these episodes, clinicians should ensure that the symptoms are not better explained by another medical condition, another mental illness, or by the effects of a substance. When diagnosing a major depressive episode, the clinician should carefully consider if loss and/or bereavement is playing a role in the symptomatology. While DSM-IV-TR included a bereavement exclusion, DSM-5 eliminated the bereavement exclusion to give the clinician greater judgment and flexibility in making the diagnosis of major depression, and determining the role of bereavement. When making such a determination, the clinician should take the following into account, cultural norms, the patient's history, the severity of the symptoms, and whether or not the patient seems to improve. 

00:12:10
BIPOLAR I DISORDER 

00:12:15
MERLIN HUFF Yeah, I know. I asked (inaudible ) really start on the day, you know. Jump right into it. Get stuff crack into it, an early breakfast. 

00:12:25
HANNAH HUFF No. Come back to bed. You need to come back to bed. 

00:12:25
MERLIN HUFF But think about all the stuff I can get done today. 

00:12:30
HANNAH HUFF You can get it done at seven. You don't need… 

00:12:30
MERLIN HUFF I'll just, I'll run down to the park and I'll do a quick… 

00:12:35
HANNAH HUFF What are you planning to do? What are you… What are need and although… 

00:12:35
MERLIN HUFF Okay. So here's what I was thinking. I was thinking that I would start, I would start with push-ups, and I would do a set of 20 push-ups, and then I would do, and then I would do 20 squats. 

00:12:45
SEAN HARRIGAN The characteristic feature of Bipolar I is at least one manic episode. Individuals may also experience hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, these are not necessary for making a diagnosis of Bipolar I. Because of the incidence of manic episodes, Bipolar I disorder can be especially distressing for those experiencing it. The patient may have limited insight into the increased energy and elevated mood of the episode, and can wind up involved with risky or dangerous behavior. The individual may seem unable to turn off this excessive drive, staying up at all hours and seeming constantly distracted. Further, their behavior can quickly turn destructive, affecting the individual and their loved ones. Because such patients often lack insight, it can be more difficult for them to control their symptoms, and they may even be unwilling to seek treatment. Their actions may become erratic as well. They may take on a range of excessive or inappropriate tasks, regardless of their experience or talent for them. For those partaking in destructive activities, it can mean doing things that they never would normally, such as being financially reckless or engaging in sexual indiscretions. This behavior can subsequently be followed by a major depressive episode, in what has sometimes been called a post-psychotic depression. In part, such behaviors are the reason why the suicide risk is 15 times higher for patients with Bipolar I disorder when compared to the rest of the population.

00:14:20
Specifiers 

00:14:25
SEAN HARRIGAN There are numerous specifiers a clinician can add to the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. These will allow the clinician to include additional details regarding the nature and severity of the diagnosis. Such core specifiers can be useful in characterizing the disorder over time. For example, the specifier with anxious distress can indicate that the patient has experienced feelings of foreboding, agitation, or tension, intense worry leading to trouble concentrating, or the feeling that they may be unable to maintain control of their thoughts and actions. In addition to the anxious distress specifier, other course specifiers include mixed features, catatonia, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern. 

00:15:20
BIPOLAR II DISORDER 

00:15:25
SEAN HARRIGAN Unlike Bipolar I disorder, Bipolar II disorder cannot include a manic episode, but instead entails both a past or current hypomanic episode, and a past or current major depressive episode. The appearance of a manic episode, which is more severe than hypomania, will constitute a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder. Because of the absence of manic episodes, Bipolar II disorder causes less functional impairment than Bipolar I disorder. More specifically, Bipolar II disorder doesn't have the same degree of disability, and features no psychotic symptoms and cannot require hospitalization. Despite this, Bipolar II disorder has a risk of rapid cycling, meaning the individual experiences at least multiple mood episodes over the course of a year. This can make it more difficult to determine the course of the illness and can lead to worse outcomes. For example, the individual may be ill longer and have a prolonged depressive phase when compared to someone with Bipolar I disorder. The impulsivity that can characterize individuals with Bipolar II disorder can lead to a high risk of suicide, with one out of three patients having attempted suicide. Some individuals with Bipolar II disorder will later experience a manic episode, which changes their diagnosis from Bipolar II disorder to Bipolar I. While it is not inherent in the coding for Bipolar II disorder, the clinician can specify the current or most recent episode, the severity of symptoms, if the patient's condition is in full or partial remission, and other qualifiers such as the anxious distress, and seasonal pattern specifiers. 

00:17:10
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND CO-MORBIDITY 

00:17:15
SEAN HARRIGAN It is important for clinicians to distinguish between Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorder by determining if the patient has ever experienced a manic episode. Additionally, both Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from major depressive disorder, which can have hypomanic or manic symptoms does not fully comprise the characteristics of Bipolar I or Bipolar II. The symptoms of Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorder can also resemble those of other disorders. This can be seen in the increased speaking tempo and distractibility of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or the mood changes and impulsivity of personality disorders. It's also possible to mistake the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder for Bipolar I or Bipolar II. Intense anxiety may seem to resemble Bipolar I's racing thoughts. Still three quarters of individuals with Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder also experience a co-morbid anxiety disorder. Some studies have shown that up to half of all patients with bipolar disorder can also have a substance use disorder. However, the presence of solely a substance use disorder should be considered, it's also possible for an individual to experience substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. Disorders along the schizophrenia spectrum maybe similar to Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorder. However, if these disorders do not have major mood symptoms, there will still be isolated periods of solely psychotic symptoms. Additionally, if the patient's symptoms don't match those of a hypomanic or a major depressive episode, the clinician should consider cyclothymic disorder. 

00:19:15
CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER 

00:19:20
SEAN HARRIGAN Cyclothymic disorder involves discrete episodes of hypomania and major depression that are not severe enough to qualify for a hypomanic or major depressive episode. 

00:19:30
JASON KO Okay, we're short on cash. That's what… That's what… That's the problem, right? That's the basic problem. We don't have… We don't have enough money. But I got this figured out… 

00:19:35
SEAN HARRIGAN Even as these symptoms aren't as severe as either Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder, they are significant enough to cause functional impairment. 

00:19:45
JASON KO Whatever. But here's what I discovered. 

00:19:50
SEAN HARRIGAN While an individual with these disorders can feel like their lives are unraveling, helping them to identify the disorder can potentially provide a sense of comfort. Identifying a mood disorder can let the patient know that their mood is the product of a mental disorder, which can often be managed and treated with medications and/or psychotherapy. Diagnosing these disorders is the first step in helping patients find appropriate treatment, so that they can lead a more balanced happy life.
