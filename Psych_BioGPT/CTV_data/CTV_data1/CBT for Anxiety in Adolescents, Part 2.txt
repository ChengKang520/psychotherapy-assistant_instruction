BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Andrew is a 14-year-old boy who lives with his mother. His parents divorced nine years ago when he was five. He has weekly contact with his father who lives nearby but is severely acrophobic. He also has an older sister, Kate, who is 20 and at university. Andrew has very classic social anxiety. He doesn't experience school refusal, but gets very anxious about speaking in public, which is necessary for course work. The referral was motivated by school, who say Andrew is going to fail some of his courses because he won't do the public speaking elements from his course work. The problem was triggered when Andrew, transferred to high school.

ASSESMENT EDUCATION DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS EXPOSURE 

00:00:40
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The aims of the assessment are as follows: To obtain an understanding of the young person's difficulties. To define areas of strength. To assess suitability for CBT. To explain the nature of the therapy. To build a good rapport with the young person and parent or carer. 

00:01:00
symptoms & safety behaviours 

00:01:00
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Joining the assessment, the therapist was able to build-up a fairly clear picture of Andrew's problems. He experienced anxiety mainly when speaking in front of the class, using the phone or asking for things in shops. He have a small group of friends, but was uncomfortable in larger groups. He described his main symptoms as sweating, shaky legs, heart racing, fast breathing and butterflies. He find these very distressing and as a result, had started to avoid lots of activities. Where possible, he got his mother to make phone calls and go to the shops for him, intended to invite his friends ran into his house to avoid having to go out with them. One of his fears was that he would pass-out and look stupid. In response to it, he had developed a number of safety behaviours. This included tensing his muscles and holding on to things. 

00:01:55
Muscle tensing Holding onto chairs etc 

00:01:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON During the assessment, he communicated well with the therapist and was willing to talk about his thoughts and feelings. He also recognized that his anxiety was interfering with his life, but at this stage he was rather pessimistic about being able to change anything. The theraphist assessed him as being suitable for CBT and Andrew agreed, to have a go. He was willing to attend regularly and appeared quite interested, but his body language suggested that he also felt quite nervous about it. 

00:02:20
ASSESMENT Assessment & goal setting Generating a graded hierarchy 

00:02:20
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Part of the assessment was to a certain goals. The therapist saw Andrew and his mother separately, giving them both the opportunity to talk more openly with her. The session is not shown here, but would have followed a similar format to the one demonstrated early with Katy. Andrew's mothers goals were: For Andrew's be less irritable. 

00:02:40
For Andrew to: 

00:02:40
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON For him to stop nagging her to do things. 

00:02:45
stop nagging me to do things for him 

00:02:45
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON And for him to pass his exams and get a decent job. She was currently worried that his problems would stop him from getting a job at all. Andrew's Goals were: To be able to phone friends. 

00:02:55
Phone my friends 

00:02:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON To be able to speak in class. 

00:02:55
Speak in front of the class 

00:02:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON To be able to go to McDonalds and order food. To be able to go to a shop and ask for a drink. The goals of parents and young people will often be quite different and some negotiation maybe needed. As we join the scene, the therapist has brought Andrew and his mother together, in order to this. 

00:03:15
CAROLINE Okay, now, Andrew, we've drawn up a list of goals that you want to work on, ah, and those things include being able to read out aloud in class, being able to make a phone call to friends and to order food from McDonalds and buy drinks at the shop. So we, we're happy with our list and these all the things that you like to do without feeling anxious. 

00:03:35
ANDREW Yeah, hmm. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN But not like someone who's a bit less (inaudible ) at home(ph). 

00:03:40
CAROLINE Right. Okay, he like someone to be, with less (inaudible ) gonna be at home. What, what, what sort's of things do you think contributed to that at home, with Andrew at the moment? 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN  Ah, I don't really know, he's just, hmm- 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN - just really in a bad mood all the time and, and, but he asked me to, to phone his friends from, when I say, "no," he says, he hates me and that's, hmm, you know, that I'm a horrible person and we have not to be ground, it's not very nice.(crosstalk) 

00:04:05
CAROLINE Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN He, he, you know, he wants me to go to the shops for him and stuff like that. 

00:04:10
CAROLINE Right, sound like it's really difficult. So, so most of the arguments and the irritability, it seems to occur when he's asking you to do things for him, which you think is perhaps, do for himself. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, exactly. 

00:04:20
CAROLINE And what sort of things, again, did he say, he wanted to do for himself? 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Well, I think he should bring his friends, himself. 

00:04:25
CAROLINE Okay. Well, if you look Andrew's list, one of things that he actually liked to achieve is to be able to phone his friends himself. Yeah? What are the sorts of things would you like him to do? 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN Well, at his age, he should be able to go to the shops and sort of things like that, you know, get his own clothes, that sort of thing. 

00:04:40
CAROLINE Okay, and again on the, on the list here, we've got goals for Andrew's going to shops and buy things for himself and ask for those things for himself, so do you think that maybe if we work on some of the goals that Andrew sets out for himself, that would also help get some of the things that you'd like to change at home. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. I guess, we wouldn't have anything left to argue about, wouldn't we? 

00:05:00
ANDREW Sure, we find something else, thought(ph). 

00:05:00
CAROLINE (laughs), 'Coz I (inaudible ) yeah. (laughs), Okay then well, I think, it'd be great if we can work together as a team on these things. I think Andrew, is gonna need a lot supports and help over the next few weeks and if you can work together, then I think, we'll be able to get, something is gonna make you both happy. 

00:05:15
ANDREW  Okay. 

00:05:20
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Both Andrew and his mother had identified problems and goals, which stemmed from his anxiety problems, but they catched them in very different terms. For Andrew, the issue was about being able to do normal everyday things without getting distressed, whereas his mother focused more on the way his anxiety was impacting on her and on their home life. In her eyes, he was irritable and demanding and was not doing the things you would normally expect on 14-year-old. It was important for Andrew's mother to feel that her concerns have been heard and that the therapy would address the problems she was experiencing. However, it was also important that the goals Andrew had identified remained at the center of the agenda. By getting his mother to look at the possible reasons for Andrew's irritability, the therapist helped her to see his moods and behavior in the context of his underlying anxiety problems and to appreciate that. In broad terms, they where both wanting the same thing. His mother had paid more sympathetic towards the end of the session and the clip highlights the importance for anxiety education for the parent, as well as the young person. Having jointly agreed the goals, the next task. 

00:06:30
Assessment Assessment & goal setting 

00:06:30
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Was to break them down further and generate a graded hierarchy, which would serve to guide the exact content and direction of therapy. Andrew was asked to choose the easiest goal first, which for him was phoning a friend. The goal was then broken down into small steps. He was helped to identify number of situations relating to using a phone and to rate this according to the degree of anxiety they provoked. These situations where then ranked in order of difficulty. The session, which is not demonstrated here would be similar to that shown with Katy. Although, the fifth among the choice(ph) is not usually used with adolescence. Andrew and the therapist, together produced the following hierarchy. 

00:07:10

SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Following the assessment- 

00:07:25
Assessment & goal setting Generating a graded hierarchy 

00:07:25
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - the therapist was able to stop planning the rest of the therapy. In view of his age and his slightly tensed relationship with his mother, she decided to see Andrew, mainly on his own and the remainder of the clip showed only Andrew and the therapist. However, the therapist was keen to keep his mother involved and often invited her to join them towards the end of the session, so that she or Andrew could explain the main things that have been covered. She also saw Andrew's mother separately on occasions, such pattern is common with adolescence. 

00:07:50
Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self monitoring 

00:07:50
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The start of the education phase is not shown on the video. Anxiety education involved going through the anxiety handout, a copy of which is included in the manual. Andrew was set his first homework task of filling in his own physical symptoms, thoughts and behaviors. 

00:08:05
EDUCATION Anxiety education Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self monitoring 

00:08:05
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  The therapist used Andrew's homework answers as a basis for showing the formulation with him. Together, they drew out his anxiety cycle concentrating on current triggers and symptoms rather then each illogical factors. The cycle helped Andrew and the therapist, identify the main triggers and to explore the spiraling nature of the anxiety response. It also helped Andrew to see how his avoidance of situation served to increase his anxiety in the long time. We join Andrew and the therapist towards the end of the formulation session. They have already discussed one of Andrew's strongest triggers, having to stand up and speak in front of the class and Andrew has described how he thinks he needs to hold on to a chair to stop himself from falling over. The therapist sees this as an opportunity to start to challenge Andrew's use of safety behaviors. 

00:08:55
CAROLINE  Okay, then Andrew, so when you are speaking in front of the class, you get this butterflies in your tummy and your heart is rising, you feel a bit shaky and what are some of the thoughts that are actually going through your mind at that time? 

00:09:10
ANDREW Stuff like, I'll fall over and, ah, I don't know, look at me and laugh and start to fall over. 

00:09:15
CAROLINE Okay, so you worry that you, you gonna fall over. When you're thinking those things, does that make the feelings that you get, worse or better? 

00:09:25
ANDREW Much worse. 

00:09:25
CAROLINE Much worse. Yeah. 

00:09:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:09:25
CAROLINE Yeah. That sounds pretty terrifying really, if you really think that you gonna fall over. Now, I know you're a bit (inaudible ), aren't you, yeah? Well, I happen to know that David Beckham, when he plays football, always wears the same boots 'coz he thinks that if he doesn't wear the same boots, then the team would gonna go on and lose the match. Okay? 

00:09:45
ANDREW All right. 

00:09:45
CAROLINE Now, do you really think, if David Beckham didn't wear his lucky boots, it suddenly lose all his talents, this world-class football or captain of England, who scores the most fantastic goals. Do you think that if he didn't wear his lucky boots he suddenly lose all his talent? 

00:10:00
ANDREW No. 

00:10:00
CAROLINE  Huh? 

00:10:05
ANDREW Of course not. 

00:10:05
CAROLINE Okay, so is it the boots that are making him a good footballer or did he just think that? 

00:10:10
ANDREW Well, his just think that his boots does not make him good. 

00:10:15
CAROLINE Okay, so what do you think he have to do to test them out? 

00:10:15
ANDREW  Try playing a game without wearing his lucky boots. 

00:10:20
CAROLINE Brilliant, exactly. Well, I think that some of things you do a bit like David Beckham wearing his lucky boot, really, so when you speak aloud in class, you hold on to things because you think but if you don't hold on to things, and you'll gonna fall over. 

00:10:35
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:10:35
CAROLINE So what would you have to do, if your gonna test that out to see if it was true or not? 

00:10:40
ANDREW I don't know, ah, maybe after read out in class without holding on to something to see if I won't fall over. 

00:10:50
CAROLINE Brilliant. That's exactly what we'd like to do, so do you think you gonna be able to do that? 

00:10:55
ANDREW Beyond bucking, I'll, I'll try my best. 

00:10:55
CAROLINE  Okay, brilliant. 

00:11:00
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON At the beginning of the clip, the therapist reinforced the link between thoughts and feelings, by asking whether the worries about falling over made him feel better or worse. She then went on to link Andrew safety behavior of holding on to the chair, to the footballer's fictitious superstition about his boots. Clearly, the therapist may need to adopt the example according to the young person's interest and role models, but the general technique can be very effective. Not all young people was very easily persuaded as Andrew and however, willing to try it, he will still need a lot of help to overcome his safety behaviors. However, by getting Andrew to challenge his beliefs, the therapist is preparing the ground for changing behavior. When she asked how the footballer's beliefs could be tested, her choice of languages is in keeping with the notion of CBT as a scientific process. Young people can be encourage to see themselves as investigators, collecting data, making hypothesis and then setting up experiments to test them out. The exposure exercises are often introduced in this way, drawing the focus away from they young persons performance and on to the process itself. 

00:12:10
EDUCATION Anxiety education Sharing the formulation Emotional recognition Self monitoring 

00:12:10
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The aims of self-monitoring were as follows. To develop the young persons ability to separate events, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. To introduce the idea that physical reactions serve as cues to begin using coping strategies. To provide more information for the therapist about the young person's anxiety patterns. Young people may have difficulty in identifying emotions, commonly confused thoughts, feelings and behavior and perceive them as being well beyond their control. The opportunity to, to define and identify the way they feel, as well as linking it to their thoughts and behavior can help a young person to feel less helpless and more in control of their emotions. 

00:12:50
CAROLINE  Okay, Andrew, we, we've met for a few weeks now already. (clears throat) And one of our problems is that, I can only be with you for an hour a week and you feel anxious lots of times, about in everyday, so what would be really helpful for me to find out a bit more about some of the experiences and difficulties that you happen you feel anxious, would be, if you could fill this diary out for me, does that sound all right? 

00:13:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:13:15
CAROLINE  But let's go straight with you because its got quite a number of columns. What I'd like you to do is every time you feel anxious and I'd like you to try and fill this diary. May you not, may not always be able to do that say, if you're in school, but maybe you could fill it in as soon after you felt anxious, whenever you felt comfortable, okay? 

00:13:30
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
CAROLINE  Ah, in the first column, I'd like you to put the dates and the time of when you actually felt anxious and in the second column, I'd like you to rate your anxiety in the scale from nought to 10, so nought would be not feeling anxious at all and ten would be the most anxious you've ever felt. 

00:13:50
ANDREW Alright. 

00:13:50
CAROLINE Okay? In the third column, where it says, "activity," I'd like you to just write down what you were doing exactly... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ANDREW Alright. 

00:13:55
CAROLINE  in the situation that you're feeling anxious in. 

00:14:00
ANDREW Okay. 

00:14:00
CAROLINE And then that next column labeled "Feelings", I'd like you to write down the physical symptoms that you're actually experiencing. 

00:14:05
ANDREW Like the jelly legs? 

00:14:10
CAROLINE Just like your jelly legs, yeah, or your butterflies or your shakiness. Yeah, that's brilliant. In the next column, where it says "Thoughts", and this is usually the one that people find most difficult, I'd like to write down what you were thinking, so what thoughts were going through your mind. 

00:14:25
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:14:25
CAROLINE And then the final column is the "Behavior". I'd like you to just write down for me exactly what it was that you did. 

00:14:30
ANDREW Right, right. 

00:14:30
CAROLINE  Does that sound to you... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:14:35
CAROLINE ...very straight forward? 

00:14:35
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:14:35
CAROLINE So what I'd like us to do now, really, is, is for you to think of, ah, an example, the last time that you felt anxious, and then just to check, I'd like us to go through it together. Now you tell me about an example to the day where your friend phoned you at home and asks you to go to a party. 

00:14:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:14:50
CAROLINE And that make you feel really anxious into it. 

00:14:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:14:50
CAROLINE  So could we go through the example together now. 

00:14:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:14:55
CAROLINE All right, so when, when was it that your friend phoned on? 

00:14:55
ANDREW  Last Tuesday or, last Tuesday. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
CAROLINE  Last Tuesday, yeah? 

00:15:05
ANDREW Yeah. Just after school. 

00:15:05
CAROLINE Just after school, so about four o' clock, something like that? 

00:15:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:15:05
CAROLINE  Okay, so in this column, the date and time, we're gonna put Tuesday, four o' clock. And how anxious do you think you felt when he asks you to go to the party in a scale from, from nought to ten? 

00:15:15
ANDREW  It was about eight? 

00:15:20
CAROLINE About eight, so it's quite high. 

00:15:20
ANDREW It's quite around(ph), yeah. 

00:15:20
CAROLINE Okay, and, what were you actually doing(ph), you said it was when he phoned you and asks you to the party, but what was it exactly that made you worry, what was the thing that was making you most anxious? 

00:15:30
ANDREW Hmm. At first, it was picking up the phone... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:15:35
ANDREW ...but then when he asked me that he wanted me to come to the party with him, then I started getting shaky legs because of thoughts about all the people who would be there. 

00:15:45
CAROLINE Uh, all right. Okay, so it's actually being invited to the party... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:15:45
CAROLINE ...that making you feel most anxious, yeah. 

00:15:50
ANDREW Uh-huh. 

00:15:50
CAROLINE Okay, great. So we put it in that a column there, you know, being invited to go to the party. Then in the, the "Feelings" column, what, what sorts of physical symptoms did you get? You mentioned your shaky legs already, were there any other physical symptoms you felt? 

00:16:00
ANDREW  I've got butterflies, and I started, I thought that I might fall over... (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:16:10
ANDREW ...and I didn't, I needed to, hmm, hold on to something. 

00:16:10
CAROLINE Okay, so you got your shaky legs and you got butterflies in your tummy, yeah? 

00:16:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:16:15
CAROLINE And then, in the next column, I'd like to know what was going on through your mind, what thoughts were raising through your mind at that time? You've already mentioned some of them. 

00:16:25
ANDREW Stuff like being really, really scared and I didn't, I didn't ah, really know what to do... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:16:30
ANDREW ...so, I just tried to, my thought, I should play cool(ph) and just say, to say just agree. 

00:16:40
CAROLINE Okay, so you, you're feeling really scared. 

00:16:40
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:16:40
CAROLINE Okay. What, what was actually going through your mind that you think that made you feel really scared? 

00:16:45
ANDREW Just thinking about the people who were gonna be there at this party... (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
CAROLINE All right. 

00:16:50
ANDREW ...and the people trying to talk to me who I didn't really know. 

00:16:55
CAROLINE Okay. So you're thinking, "People are gonna talk to me who I don't really know." And then what do you think might happen if they did talk to you at the party? 

00:17:00
ANDREW I get jelly legs and fall over. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
CAROLINE All right. 

00:17:05
ANDREW People bluff a lot(ph). 

00:17:05
CAROLINE You we're really thinking, "Gosh, I'm gonna fall over," and that's a really horrible thought, isn't it? So that would go in that column there. And so what did you think when he actually invited you to the party? What did you do actually, how you deal with the situation? 

00:17:15
ANDREW I'm just played it cool and I just ah, I said, "Yeah," but I said that I had to go, so I just like tried to get off the phone as quick as I could. 

00:17:25
CAROLINE Right, okay. So you try to end the conversation really quickly, and that's what you put in that column. 

00:17:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:17:30
CAROLINE Okay, I think, you're doing really well. You've, doing as really good example, we've gone through the columns. Now, I'm gonna ask you to fill this in for the next week, and, and it's up to you whether or not you want to keep it private or whether or not you want it to share with your mom. How do you feel about that? 

00:17:45
ANDREW No, I don't want, I don't want my mom see that. 

00:17:50
CAROLINE Okie dokie. Well, I think we need to tell your mom that I've given you use(ph) to do, but it is private and it's up to you to keep it in a safe place. You got someone who can to keep it? 

00:17:55
ANDREW Yeah, well, I'm not tellin' you. 

00:18:00
CAROLINE Well, you've done really well so far with that last example, but just to make sure that I really explained it clearly, what I'd like to do is to go through an example together, and you actually fill in your diary for me. Is that okay? 

00:18:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:18:10
CAROLINE  Okay, and so, you have the pen. Bring them up. Let's, let's do a different example this time. Let's think about, uhm, last week when you're talking about reading out in class. I know, you felt really anxious when you did that. 

00:18:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:18:30
CAROLINE So, uhm, when was that? The first column says, "date and time." When was that? 

00:18:30
ANDREW  It was in Thursday. 

00:18:35
CAROLINE Thursday? Okay, so you can put that in. And what was it that you're actually doing? 

00:18:40
ANDREW Hmm, I was, I had to, my teacher asked me to read out a piece of Macbeth... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
CAROLINE Right. 

00:18:50
ANDREW ...in front of the class. 

00:18:50
CAROLINE Okay, so that sounds pretty scary, yeah. So can you just put that in activity column. 

00:18:55
ANDREW Hmm, I don't know, how you spell Macbeth. 

00:18:55
CAROLINE  All right. Okay. Don't worry about your spelling. Don't worry about your handwriting. I'm not gonna be marking it. You're not at school now. So, hmm, just put as it sounds. I don't want you worried about that. 

00:19:10
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:19:10
CAROLINE Okay? And on a scale from nought to ten, how anxious did you feel reading out? 

00:19:15
ANDREW Ten out of ten. 

00:19:15
CAROLINE  Ten, so it's absolutely maximum. 

00:19:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:19:20
CAROLINE It was you feel? 

00:19:20
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:19:20
CAROLINE  Okay. What's next column on the chart? 

00:19:25
ANDREW Feelings. 

00:19:25
CAROLINE Okay. So, how did you feel? What physical symptoms were you feeling when you read out in class? 

00:19:30
ANDREW My jelly leg. 

00:19:30
CAROLINE Jelly legs. Okay. So, may put them in there. 

00:19:35
ANDREW The spelling not much. 

00:19:35
CAROLINE Yeah, don't worry about that at all. 

00:19:40
ANDREW Hmm, and butterflies. 

00:19:40
CAROLINE  Okay, great. Any other physical symptoms? 

00:19:50
ANDREW Uh hmm, I needed to grab on to something. 

00:19:55
CAROLINE Right. Okay. So, that's actually, is that symptom or is that a behavior? 

00:20:00
ANDREW That's behavior. 

00:20:00
CAROLINE Okay. So, which column would go in? 

00:20:00
ANDREW Into behavior. 

00:20:00
CAROLINE All right, brilliant, well done. It's really important that we learn to, the difference between our thoughts, the feelings from the behavior. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
ANDREW Right. (nods) 

00:20:10
CAROLINE  So you did that really well. So you got your jelly legs, you got your butterflies, you're reading out in class. What thoughts were going through your mind? 

00:20:20
ANDREW I was breaking in. 

00:20:25
CAROLINE (laughs) Breaking in? What does that mean? 

00:20:25
ANDREW You know, like dead bat(ph). 

00:20:30
CAROLINE Right. So it was really, really scary? 

00:20:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:20:30
CAROLINE Yeah? Okay. And what was actually going through your mind? What were you thinking to yourself? 

00:20:35
ANDREW I thought like I'm, I'd fall over like I usually do and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:20:40
ANDREW ...that people look at me and laugh at. 

00:20:45
CAROLINE Okay. So you're thinkin' I'm gonna fall over and people are gonna laugh at me? 

00:20:45
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
CAROLINE  Yes? So, which column does that go in? 

00:20:50
ANDREW Thoughts. 

00:20:50
CAROLINE Brilliant. Well done. 

00:20:50
ANDREW And then my feelins as well as that it go and really, it was like I felt really sweating and stuff. 

00:20:55
CAROLINE Okay. Great. So, we need to put, I thought I was gonna fall over and people would laugh at me, in the thoughts column. 

00:21:05
[sil.] 

00:21:05
ANDREW  Then my feelings. 

00:21:10
CAROLINE In the feelings column, brilliant, yeah, well done. 

00:21:15
[sil.] 

00:21:15
CAROLINE  Okay, was there anything else that you did? 'Coz the final column there was your behavior, how you had to cope with situation. You said you, you held on to something. Was there anything else that you did? 

00:21:30
ANDREW Because I didn't wanna do it, I thought, I mean, I had to get out of it. So, I just started to be (inaudible ) than I actually. 

00:21:37
CAROLINE Right. Okay. So, you might as well get out of reading a bit more, you managed to avoid, okay, so please provide that in the, in the behavior column, yeah? 

00:21:45
ANDREW I did that and my teacher told me to sit down. So, I got out of it. 

00:21:45
CAROLINE Right. So you're quite good at the avoidance then? 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:50
CAROLINE  Great. Can I have a look at them? 

00:22:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:22:00
CAROLINE Brilliant. So you filled that in perfectly. You analyzed the differences between your feelings, your thoughts, and your behavior. And what I now like you to do over next week is fill this in every time you get a situation where you're feeling anxious. You think you can do that for me? 

00:22:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:22:15
CAROLINE And then bring it with you next week and we'll have a look at it together and see what you come up with. Is that okay? 

00:22:20
ANDREW That's fine. 

00:22:20
CAROLINE Great, stuff. 

00:22:20
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON As highlighted during the self monitoring session with Katy, the therapist needs to prepare the young person very carefully for this task. Here, the therapist explained the general principles first then went through an example orally. And finally, got Andrew to fill in a sheet himself. This also ensured that he would have a rhythmic sample to refer to at home. The therapist's questions helps Andrew to articulate exactly what it was about each situation that was making him anxious and also, to start distinguishing between the feelings, thoughts, and behavior. At first, Andrew found it hard to identify his thoughts. The therapist helped by asking questions such as, "So, what was going through your mind to make you feel like this?" And, "What did you think might happen?" Her work inevitably has connotations at school. And the young person can be quickly put off by worries about presentation and spelling. The therapist made it clear to Andrew that spelling was not an issue and that she was only interested in the information he was recording. Confidentiality is also important particularly with adolescents. In Katy's session, her mother was invited to help with the task. But for Andrew, privacy was paramount. This needs to be respected and the importance of privacy needs to be explained to parents. Self-monitoring is a skill, which needs to be learned, practice and that the therapist should not expect the young person to master immediately. Her work review is therefore crucial and form the main agenda for the next session. 

00:23:50
CAROLINE  Now, Andrew, it's good to see you again. Last week, uhm, I asked you to fill in some anxiety diaries for me. Did you manage to do that? 

00:24:05
ANDREW Yeah, probably. 

00:24:05
CAROLINE A great stuff(ph)? 

00:24:05
ANDREW Ah, I only filled it in a few times. 

00:24:10
CAROLINE That's okay, no problem at all. That's really good. Can you, and perhaps I'd have a quick look at it and perhaps you can go through it with me. I got a couple of examples on here, that's excellent! I'm really pleased that you managed to do those for me. How did you find filling it in, was it easy or was it difficult? 

00:24:25
ANDREW Hmm, it was okay but I was hiding it. 

00:24:30
CAROLINE All right, okay. You're a bit worried about people... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
ANDREW Yes. 

00:24:35
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON ...seeing it. So you did a good job. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
ANDREW Yes. 

00:24:35
CAROLINE You kept it in a, in a safe place. You won't get other hands on it, I know. Okay, well done. (laughing) Right then, we've got an, an example here on Saturday. You've rated it nine out of 10 for anxiety and you were out with your friends, Paul and John, going to McDonald's. Yeah? 

00:24:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:24:50
CAROLINE Right. Stood in the, in the food queue. Now, you've listed that your feelings here, as having butterflies and you've told me in having your wobbly legs here. 

00:25:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:25:00
CAROLINE Yeah? You remember that. Well, that's really good. You could assess an excellent symptoms there. And then you've said that, uhm, you went to the back of the queue and gave Paul the money. So your queue went(ph) must be food. You felt really scared. You've got your butterflies and your jelly legs. 

00:25:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:25:15
CAROLINE And then you decided to droves(ph) at the back of the queue when you gave your friend the money. Is that because you were a bit scared? 

00:25:20
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:25:25
CAROLINE You didn't wanna want to ask for the, ask for the food yourself. Okay then, you've done a really good job of identifying your feelings and rating your anxiety and also describing what you did. And you've written here into your thoughts column, "I just felt really scared." Okay. So it's obviously there a really terrifying experience for you. 

00:25:40
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:25:45
CAROLINE That sounds like that was a feeling, feeling really scared, yeah? 

00:25:45
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:25:50
CAROLINE Can you try and tell me, can you remember what was actually going through your mind at that time? 

00:25:50
ANDREW  Just that, when I asked him like, can I have, whatever I want and that nothing have come out and that I stutter and sort of laughed after or something. 

00:26:05
CAROLINE Right. So you're worried that you wouldn't, the words wouldn't come out, and if it did, you'd stutter. 

00:26:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:26:10
CAROLINE And look toughed. Yeah. So those are things that you're actually thinking at the time. Alright, so what we're going to do is, just now, if you don't mind, can you just start to that, to that column there the things you've just described now so that your thought of won't be able to speak... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:26:25
CAROLINE ...and then look daft. 

00:26:30
[sil] 

00:26:30
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Try to identify the things that are going through your mind. (clears throat) It's actually one of the hardest bits of filling the diary in. It's really important to learn the difference between what you feel inside and what you actually think in your head. Is that okay? 

00:26:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:26:50
CAROLINE All right, and can I just have that diary back, you keep all of that and I'll go through the next example. And, 'coz you've got another one here on Monday which was, the activity was you're out with your mates and your mobile phone rang. Yeah? 

00:27:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:27:00
CAROLINE And again you got your, your jelly legs and you felt your heart raising. Uhm, can you, can you just tell me now again what thoughts were going through your mind? 

00:27:10
ANDREW Same again, that I wouldn't know who it was and when I picked up the phone, I'd stutter. 

00:27:15
ANDREW Okay. 

00:27:15
ANDREW  And it just, it'd be nobody was there when I answered the phone. 

00:27:20
CAROLINE That's right. 

00:27:20
ANDREW Who called me up to speak. 

00:27:20
CAROLINE  Right then. So you're worried that people think what about you? What did you think people might think? You didn't, you didn't speak what you were really worried about. 

00:27:30
ANDREW There was stuff though, I was, I was silly or weird or something. 

00:27:35
CAROLINE Okay. Right. Then so, can you put those things down in that column for me there. You thought that you might stutter and you thought that people might think that you're a bit soft, a bit daft. Well, I'm really pleased with the progress you've made in filling the diaries out. That's really helped me to understand and know a lot more about the actual situations you get in and how you feel, and what you think. So, I just like us to go through a few more examples to get that now in the session, just to fill that for me, Okay. 

00:28:05
ANDREW Good. 

00:28:05
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  But rather worried as he handed over his crumpled sheets as though he was expecting to be told off. The therapist responded by praising him and reinforcing the parts he had filled incorrectly. As expected, the thoughts column had proved most difficult and in the first example, he had identified the feeling rather than the thought, "I just felt really scared." The therapist picked up the tone of this commenting on how bad he must have been feeling and used it as a basis for drawing out his thoughts, "So what was going to your mind to make you feel like that?" Although this part of the therapy can appear rather repetitive and laborious, it is very important since it forms the backbone of later work on thought challenging and, and monitoring exposure. The therapist is now ready to move on to the next stage of therapy- 

00:28:55
DEVELOPING COPING SKILLS Physical: relaxation & breathing Cognitive: coping thoughts & Challenging anxious thoughts Behavior: being prepared 

00:28:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - for someone of Andrew's age and cognitive maturity, the main emphasis of the coping skill section will be on thought challenging, however, first the therapist offers Andrew some immediate strategies for dealing with distressing physical symptoms. Entering turning such of provoking situation is very difficult and it sometimes helps to give children a coping strategy to help them deal with the possibility of, of overwhelming physical sensations. Breathing exercises are one way of increasing a child's sense of control and mastery over the situation. This should be seen as a short-term measure to enable the young person to, to engage in behavioral experiments and subsequently to challenge their beliefs. Care should be taken to ensure that this not subsequently become a safety behavior. 

00:29:40
CAROLINE Right, now, Andrew, we're gonna get to a stage where we're gonna want you to actually practice going to some difficult situations. But before we do that I'd like to teach you something that I think is gonna help you in some of the difficult situations, we've talked before about breathing exercises and of course it's to control your breathing when you're feeling anxious suddenly. 

00:30:00
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:30:00
CAROLINE So, I'd like you to just try something with me now and then again I'm gonna ask you to go home and practice it. So it sounds okay? 

00:30:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:30:05
CAROLINE  All right then well, one of the problems is when we feel anxious is that we tend to shallow breathe. All right, what that means is that we don't use the right muscles, so we tend to just use the top parts of our chest when we're anxious. We breath like this, (breathing). 

00:30:25
ANDREW It's fast. 

00:30:25
CAROLINE Yeah, fast and, and just using that upper parts of your chest. What we really need to do is to breathe in the bottom of the chest down here, okay? And actually slow the breathing down. 

00:30:35
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:30:35
CAROLINE So the first thing you need to do is find the right location to breath from, you need to find the right muscle. So what I want you to do is, can you just run your fingers down the middle of chest starting with your breastbone. That's a good idea, it begins at the top just find the bottom of your ribcage as soon it goes soft, it gets to the bottom of your ribcage. 

00:30:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:30:55
CAROLINE Yeah. At that point, I'd like you place your hands just really lightly, it's pretty better if you slouch in your chair a bit on, it'd be easy to do and just lie your hands across the chest, just your fingertip to just touching you. 

00:31:05
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:31:05
CAROLINE What I'm gonna ask you to do is to breath in from the bottom of your chest, bottom of your ribcage, are you ready? Now what should happen is that your fingers should move slightly apart and then together again. So watch me (breathing) yeah, and then back together, can you do that for me? That's excellent. Now why not shallow breathe, as we will do, when you're anxious, here, see how your fingers don't move? So I want you to practice getting those fingers to move. 

00:31:40
ANDREW (breathing) Hmm. 

00:31:40
CAROLINE Yeah, and then back together again. Okay, excellent. So you now know how to breathe using the right muscles. The next thing you got to do is change the rate of your breathing and slow it down. 

00:31:55
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:31:55
CAROLINE And the best way to do that is actually, you got a, a watch on this moment? 

00:32:00
ANDREW Yeah, here it is. 

00:32:00
CAROLINE Okay, great stuff. It's a nice watch, that, isn't it? Yeah, well smart. All right, and what I'd like you to do, uhm, is if you look at the second hand on your watch. If you could breathe in on the numbers and after between the numbers, yeah? 

00:32:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:32:15
CAROLINE That should regulate your breathing at about the rate that most people breathe. So I'm gonna do it now with you really loud so that you can actually here the right. Okay? So we're gonna start on this three. (breathing) 

00:32:25
ANDREW Okay. (breathing). 

00:32:25
CAROLINE  Breath in (breathing) and out, breath in (breathing). 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:35
CAROLINE  Okay you just keep going. In and out. Try not to hold your breath in between just to go in on numbers, and then out. That's, so you're more relax now as you breathe. And out. That's brilliant, okay, excellent. So I want you to go home and I want you to practice that. It's probably easy to do it, just lie on your bed to start off, it's easy to see your hands is moving across your chest. 

00:33:05
ANDREW All right. 

00:33:05
CAROLINE  So you're practicing two things really, first to breathe using the right muscles and then secondly to breathe at a much more ah, controlled and slower rate. 

00:33:15
ANDREW All right. 

00:33:15
CAROLINE Okay, you practice those things everyday just for about five minutes over the next week then you'll be ready to actually use those techniques when you're in anxious situations. 

00:33:25
ANDREW All right. 

00:33:25
CAROLINE Is that make sense? 

00:33:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:33:25
CAROLINE  Okay, great. 

00:33:30
ANDREW Okay. 

00:33:30
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The therapist introduced the session by explaining the rationale behind breathing exercises referring to symptoms which Andrew had experienced. After making sure that Andrew had understood and followed her instructions, she finished the session by emphasizing the importance of home practice, giving him suggestions about how and where to do it. Although coping skills precede exposure in the manual- 

00:33:50
EXPOSURE Behavioural experiments & graded exposure Relapse prevention 

00:33:50
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - and practice, the two phases are often running parallel particularly with the old age group. In Andrew's case, the therapist introduce his behavioral experiments at this point as a way of starting to challenge Andrew's beliefs. The experiment will also provide a useful source of evidence for the formal thought challenging exercises. Anxious young people tend to be highly self conscious and self critical and exaggerate the negative aspects of their appearance and behavior. Behavioral experiments are used to help test out the validity of these beliefs. As discussed earlier, they're presented in terms of a scientific investigation in which the young person is asked to make predictions about himself. The predictions are then evaluated in, in light of the evidence. In the following clip, the therapist records the whole experiment on video, although this can be threatening for the young person initially, it is a very worthwhile technique since it provides concrete indisputable evidence. 

00:34:45
CAROLINE  All right, Andrew I think it's time that we started working on this hierarchy that we drew together a few weeks ago if you remember. 

00:34:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:34:55
CAROLINE And one of the, the first things that you wrote on the hierarchy was- 

00:34:55
Andrew's Hierarchy Answering the phone to someone I know well 1 Answering the phone to someone I don't know 5 Phoning someone I know (e.g. the therapist) 7 Phoning gran 8 Phoning a friend I don't know very well 10 

00:34:55
CAROLINE  to be able to answer the phone to someone who you knew well. 

00:35:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:35:00
CAROLINE And you know me quite well by now, so that's the first thing I'd like us to try today. Does that sound all right? 

00:35:05
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:35:10
CAROLINE You look a little bit worried but that's understandable, all right, we're gonna do this together. Now, you may have notice that there's a video camera in the room. 

00:35:15
ANDREW Hmm. 

00:35:15
CAROLINE Yeah, it's not switched on yet but we will turn it on in a bit. 

00:35:20
ANDREW You can't change to be right, no (inaudible ). 

00:35:24
CAROLINE  All right, well what we're gonna do with the video camera is that we're gonna set a situation where I'm gonna phone you on your mobile phone, you have brought it with you today haven't you? 

00:35:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:35:30
CAROLINE  Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna phone you on your phone. 

00:35:35
ANDREW All right. 

00:35:35
CAROLINE And we're gonna video that to see how well you do when you answer it. 

00:35:40
ANDREW Do we have to? 

00:35:40
CAROLINE Before we do that, I'm gonna get you to make some predictions about how you think you're going to, to do. 

00:35:45
ANDREW All right. 

00:35:45
CAROLINE  Okay, yeah? You sound a little bit nervous about it. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
ANDREW Do we have to? 

00:35:50
CAROLINE You don't have to do it, I'm not gonna make you do anything you don't want to do. But I think this is really gonna help and I'm confident you're gonna be able to do it with all the, the home practice that you've been doing with the breathing exercise and things over the last couple of weeks. 

00:36:05
ANDREW Well ah, if you think it's gonna work pretty well. (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
CAROLINE Yeah. 

00:36:05
ANDREW Okay. 

00:36:05
CAROLINE  I'm sure it's gonna help. Now it might help you actually at first if you just come out and have a look around at the camera to see what you'll gonna be able to see, just try, just have a quick look and see what you'll be able to see. 

00:36:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:20
ANDREW  Okay. 

00:36:25
CAROLINE Yeah, you're(ph) not too bad? 

00:36:25
ANDREW Nope. 

00:36:25
CAROLINE Okay then, all right, we're going to switch the camera on now at this point, all right? And you'll forget that, you'll forget it's there in a couple of minutes. Okay, we've switch it on. 

00:36:35
ANDREW All right. 

00:36:35
CAROLINE Don't worry too much about that. Now what's gonna happen is I'm gonna go out the room and I'm gonna call you on your mobile phone. 

00:36:40
ANDREW  Okay. 

00:36:45
CAROLINE All right, so what do you think is gonna happen when the phone starts to ring? 

00:36:50
ANDREW Oh, I have to remember my breathing. 

00:36:50
CAROLINE Good. 

00:36:50
ANDREW  I think I won't be able to, I'll stutter and you'll just think that I'm not alone or something. 

00:37:00
CAROLINE Right. Okay, so the first thing you said though is you're gonna remember to use your breathing exercise. That sounds like a really good idea, all right, to help you... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:37:05
CAROLINE ...stay calm, and then you said you have some worries about the fact that you think that you think you're going to stutter, all right. (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:37:10
CAROLINE So can you, can you show me what you're gonna look like on the videotape, when I look through there what am I gonna see in here when you stutter? 

00:37:20
ANDREW My legs, shaky legs. 

00:37:20
CAROLINE Oh, I'm gonna see you like shaking like that? 

00:37:20
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:37:25
CAROLINE Yeah, ah, and what else? 

00:37:25
ANDREW And I'll be sweating in the brow. 

00:37:25
CAROLINE I will not be able to see the sweats on the video? 

00:37:30
ANDREW I don't know, I think probably, yeah. 

00:37:30
CAROLINE Hmm, okay, and what do you think your voice is gonna sound like on the video? 

00:37:35
ANDREW Well, croak like this, oor. 

00:37:35
CAROLINE  Like that, yeah? 

00:37:40
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:37:40
CAROLINE So if you said, uhm, "Hello, it's Andrew." How would that sound? 

00:37:45
ANDREW I don't know. 

00:37:45
CAROLINE Can you try and do it now. 

00:37:45
ANDREW  Uhm, it sound like, croak(ph) like, "Hello, it's Andrew." 

00:37:55
CAROLINE All right, okay. So you think I'll be able to, to hear that... (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:38:00
CAROLINE ...in your voice. Okay then well I think we should just have a go with it and see what happens. 

00:38:00
ANDREW  Okay. 

00:38:05
CAROLINE Okay. You got your phone now ready? 

00:38:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:38:05
CAROLINE I'm gonna just go ne, next door and phone you... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
ANDREW  Do you know... (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
CAROLINE ...on that number. 

00:38:10
ANDREW Do you know my number? 

00:38:10
CAROLINE Yeah, I wrote it down before, okay? 

00:38:10
ANDREW Okay. 

00:38:10
CAROLINE  Sue, can I just use your phone for a moment, please? 

00:38:15
SUE Yeah, of course. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
ANDREW  Hello? 

00:38:25
CAROLINE Hello, Andrew? Its Caroline. 

00:38:25
ANDREW Hello. 

00:38:25
CAROLINE  Well done, you've done how to speak now, you've answered the telephone. 

00:38:30
ANDREW (inaudible ). 

00:38:34
CAROLINE How are you feeling? 

00:38:34
ANDREW  I'm okay. 

00:38:35
CAROLINE Was it as fun as you thought it was going to be? 

00:38:35
ANDREW No, I can't believe I answered the phone. 

00:38:40
CAROLINE Oh, well done. I'm gonna come back into the room now, we will get together. 

00:38:40
ANDREW  Great. 

00:38:45
CAROLINE Okay, bye. 

00:38:45
ANDREW Bye-bye. 

00:38:45
CAROLINE  All right, Andrew. I thought you did really well answering your phone before and we've got the videotape now, so I've to play this, uhm, I'm just gonna rewind the tape first and then we'll gonna have a look at it together. Now can you remember the predictions that you made earlier? 

00:39:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:39:00
CAROLINE  That how you thought you were going to look on the videotape. 

00:39:05
ANDREW Yeah, it's different. I thought actually I'm gonna be really shaky and feet going everywhere. 

00:39:10
CAROLINE Okay. So you thought you're gonna look like that, yeah? 

00:39:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:39:15
CAROLINE And what about your voice? 

00:39:15
ANDREW Well, I thought my voice was just gonna be like really, really croaky and stuff like going high and low and doing all sorts. 

00:39:25
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:39:25
ANDREW I thought like you'll be able to see me sweating on the tape as well. 

00:39:30
CAROLINE Okie dokie. So when we look at this videotape together, we're gonna be able to see all three of those things, aren't we? 

00:39:35
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:39:35
CAROLINE Okay let's have a look. 

00:39:40
ANDREW Is anybody gonna see this? I mean, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
CAROLINE Oh, right, uhm, nobody is gonna see this tape other than you and me. 

00:39:45
ANDREW Great. 

00:39:45
CAROLINE Okay? 

00:39:45
ANDREW Okay. 

00:39:45
CAROLINE Not your mom, not anybody else, it's just for us to see. 

00:39:50
ANDREW 'Coz I don't want the people to see 'coz they'll laugh at me. 

00:39:55
CAROLINE All right, okay I understand that you're worried about that. 

00:39:55
ANDREW Okay. 

00:39:55
CAROLINE All right, but once you've seen it, I think you might think differently. 

00:40:00
ANDREW All right. 

00:40:00
CAROLINE Okay? 

00:40:00
ANDREW Okay. 

00:40:00
CAROLINE  So we've finished looking at the tape, what do you think now you, you've seen yourself? 

00:40:10
ANDREW Yeah(ph), I can't believe I thought(ph) I'd look really, really well. You can't see me sweating or my legs moving or anything. 

00:40:15
CAROLINE You look pretty different of yourself. 

00:40:20
ANDREW I know, I know. 

00:40:20
CAROLINE Yeah, your legs weren't shaking, weren't they? 

00:40:20
ANDREW No. 

00:40:20
CAROLINE You look pretty good watching that. You felt... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:40:25
CAROLINE ...really calm and casual. 

00:40:25
ANDREW Not so. 

00:40:25
CAROLINE Yeah, so how does that make you feel now? 

00:40:25
ANDREW  A lot more confident... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
CAROLINE All right, excellent. 

00:40:30
ANDREW from, from the people on answering the phone. 

00:40:30
CAROLINE  Brilliant, so how do you, how do you think you actually manage to do it? 

00:40:35
ANDREW  Well, I remember my breathing exercises. 

00:40:40
CAROLINE Excellent. 

00:40:40
ANDREW Breathe in, so often and then I'm breathing out so often. 

00:40:45
CAROLINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:45
ANDREW And then I just kept, just as it started to ring I just kept telling myself and, and over and over and then I thought that I'm going to answer the phone and I know I can do it. 

00:40:55
CAROLINE Brilliant, excellent. So you use your breathing exercises and you told yourself you could do it. 

00:41:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:41:00
CAROLINE And look at the results in the videotape, you're brilliant weren't they? 

00:41:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:41:05
CAROLINE Okay, well done. I think you're gonna do really well in the rest of this hierarchy. 

00:41:05
ANDREW I still don't want my mom to see it, though. 

00:41:10
CAROLINE That's quite all right, we are not gonna show her. 

00:41:10
ANDREW All right. 

00:41:10
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:41:10
ANDREW  Good. 

00:41:15
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Behavioral experiments needs to be very carefully chosen and planned to, to maximize the young person's likelihood of success. As with all exposure exercises, they usually take them from the greater hierarchy starting with the low threats situation. Andrew had rated answering the phone to someone he knew well as 1 for anxiety, so the therapist could be fairly confident about the outcome of the experiment. Andrew was clearly uncomfortable about the idea of the video, the therapist acknowledge his fears and tried to reassure him by explaining exactly what would happen, allowing him to look through the camera and making it clear that she had every confidence in him. Assurances about confidentiality, a common concern for adolescents were also important. The therapist also emphasized that she would not force him to do anything he didn't want to do, something central to the whole exposure program. An important part of the preparation was to get Andrew to think about the coping skills he could use. However, the lead into the actual task was quite short in recognition of the effects of anticipatory anxiety. Even though Andrew immediately acknowledged how well he had done, it was still important to reinforce this by watching the video and re-examining his in, original predictions. The therapist would normally engage in a series of behavioral experiments, which may take a few sessions as they work through the hierarchy. The following session shows a much harder task for Andrew. 

00:42:40
CAROLINE Well Andrew, I think you do exceptionally well working through this hierarchy. You've been doing really well, ah, answering the phone to people. And the next stage is for us to get you to phone somebody else, okay? 

00:42:55
ANDREW All right. 

00:42:55
CAROLINE So, one of the things I'd like you to do today is to phone my secretary and to ask for me. 

00:43:00
ANDREW All right. 

00:43:00
CAROLINE Now, she's gonna say, "I'm afraid she's busy at the moment," obviously 'coz I'm with you. And so, what I would like you to do is to just leave a message for me and just tell the secretary your name, okay? She'll just say, "I'm sorry, Caroline is busy at the moment. Can I take your message." And you need to just tell her, "Can you tell her that Andrew phoned?" 

00:43:20
ANDREW I don't, I don't think I can do it, though. 

00:43:20
CAROLINE Well, I, I understand that you're probably worried about it. But did you think you'd be able to do the last exercise we tried? 

00:43:30
ANDREW That was easier. 

00:43:30
CAROLINE All right. So you think this is a little bit more difficult, yeah? 

00:43:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:43:30
CAROLINE  What sorts of things are you gonna do then to try and help yourself complete the task? 

00:43:35
ANDREW Remember my breathing and just keep telling myself like I did last time that I can do it. 

00:43:40
CAROLINE  Brilliant, absolutely excellent. Okay. Well, I think we shouldn't think about it for too long or else you, you might get a little bit worried about it, so just get on and do it for me(ph), so I'll switch the camera, okay, which we're used to do by now. 

00:43:55
ANDREW All right. 

00:43:55
CAROLINE Ah, I want you to phone the secretary. 

00:43:55
ANDREW (inaudible ) got(ph) me a new phone for doing so well. 

00:44:00
CAROLINE Brilliant! That looks really ah, that looks really snazzy. 

00:44:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:44:05
CAROLINE Is that the latest model? 

00:44:05
ANDREW Yeah. I keyed in your number. 

00:44:05
CAROLINE Okay. Excellent, brilliant! So, uhm, she brought you that did she, for doing so well? 

00:44:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:44:10
CAROLINE Make(ph) your home practice. Well, I'll have to say, "Well done mom," for that as well. Okay, brilliant. So you're ready to, to phone the secretary now? 

00:44:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:44:15
CAROLINE  Okay, you can do it. Just, just dial it. 

00:44:20
ANDREW Okay. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:25
SUE  Good morning. Clinical psychology. 

00:44:30
ANDREW Is Caroline there, please? 

00:44:35
SUE No, I'm afraid, Caroline, isn't here at the moment. Who's calling please? 

00:44:35
ANDREW  And could you tell her Andrew phoned, please? 

00:44:40
SUE Can I take your message? 

00:44:40
ANDREW  It's okay. 

00:44:45
SUE Okay then. Bye! 

00:44:45
CAROLINE  Fantastic, that was excellent. You did it! 

00:44:50
ANDREW Okay(ph). 

00:44:50
CAROLINE Do you think you're gonna be able to do that? 

00:44:55
ANDREW No. I thought, I thought, uhm, I, after that things that happened last time like my legs and my throat. 

00:45:00
CAROLINE And do you think that those things happened? 

00:45:00
ANDREW No. 

00:45:00
CAROLINE No, right, excellent. And of course, we're gonna be able to check that out on the video later. But you did excellently. And you said your name. 

00:45:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:45:10
CAROLINE You told me you wouldn't be able to say your name. 

00:45:10
ANDREW I didn't think I'll be able to. 

00:45:10
CAROLINE But you did. It was really clear. 

00:45:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:45:15
CAROLINE Brilliant. I'm really proud of you. That's fantastic. Okay then, because you've done so well, I think we, we need to just keep practicing it between sessions obviously 'coz again, we've only got an hour together each week. So I'd like you to go home and practice a few more phone calls if that's okay. So, who do you, who do you think you could phone over the next week? 

00:45:30
ANDREW  I could phone my nan. 

00:45:35
CAROLINE Your nan? 

00:45:35
ANDREW Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
CAROLINE Yeah, that's a good idea. What about if you just do it now? Do you think you could do that again? 

00:45:40
ANDREW Uhm, yeah, but I'll have to remember my breathing and just keep telling myself again like I can do it. 

00:45:45
CAROLINE That sounds like a really good idea, yeah. 

00:45:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:45:50
CAROLINE How many times do you think you could phone me over the next week? 

00:45:50
ANDREW  Maybe once or twice. 

00:45:55
CAROLINE Once or twice. 

00:45:55
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
CAROLINE Uh hmm. What, what tends to happen when, when you don't wanna do so then? What do you tend to do? 

00:46:00
ANDREW I don't know. I try and get out of it, I guess. (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
CAROLINE Right, okay. 'Coz I need, I think you need to practice, to do that just a, a few more times, more than once or twice, yeah? 

00:46:10
ANDREW All right. 

00:46:10
CAROLINE  Because the more you do it, the easier it's gonna get. So, what I'd really like to do is to ha, to ring me every single day and just do exactly the same thing that you've done there. 

00:46:20
ANDREW All right. 

00:46:20
CAROLINE Do you think you could do that? 

00:46:20
ANDREW  Yeah, if I, if I try. 

00:46:25
CAROLINE Okay. And phone your nan? 

00:46:25
ANDREW Yeah, I'll phone my nan. 

00:46:25
CAROLINE Okay, brilliant. And what I'd like you to do is to write it down on one of your diaries every time you make a phone call. 

00:46:35
ANDREW All right. 

00:46:35
CAROLINE Yeah. And I want you to rate your anxiety on the scale of nought to ten. Uhm, the more you do it, the more phone calls you do (inaudible ) overcome(ph) the anxiety. 

00:46:45
ANDREW I should start going down the number or start getting lower. 

00:46:45
CAROLINE  Definitely, 'coz that's what's been happening, isn't it, over the few weeks? 

00:46:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:46:50
CAROLINE The more you practice, the easier it gets. Okay? I think you're gonna be able to do this really well. 

00:46:55
ANDREW So do I now. 

00:46:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Andrew was again rather reluctant and the therapist needed to be quite firm, setting up the experiment quite quickly to minimize any anticipatory anxiety. So far, the experiments had been carried out within the same setting of the therapy session with the therapist present to support Andrew. The therapist moved this on further, setting Andrew the task of phoning her from home. This served to reinforce what he'd done in the session but it's, but extended it to a real-life situation. Unsurprisingly, Andrew needed some persuasion and the therapist needed to be firm and clear about how often he should do it. By now, Andrew could understand the rationale, an important motivating factor for all of homework exercises.

00:48:10
Cognitive techniques for challenging anxious thoughts Judge and jury technique Pie charts Survey method 

00:48:10
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON - may benefit from a range of cognitive techniques. These techniques will not work for everyone. Success will depend on the developmental level of the adolescent and on other individual differences. It is probably worth experimenting to see what works with each individual client before deciding how much emphasis to place on cognitive strategies. A number of techniques that demonstrated here, all of which were designed to help the young person explore alternative ways of viewing the world and to reevaluate their own perceptions and beliefs in light of these. The judge and jury technique: this exercise involves taking a total belief and judging whether it is valid by carefully examining the evidence for and against. The therapist needs to choose the thought very carefully to ensure that some positive evidence can always be produced, and to have a list of evidence at her fingertips since young people often find it difficult to produce this themselves. 

00:49:05
CAROLINE All right, Andrew, thanks for filling in all those diaries for me. I think you've been doing really well with your home practice over the last few weeks. 

00:49:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:49:10
CAROLINE  One of the things I think I wanted to concentrate on now ah, are some of the things that you've been writing the "thoughts" column. 

00:49:20
ANDREW All right. 

00:49:20
CAROLINE Because one of the things that we've noticed is this that sometimes, your thoughts get in the way of you doing some of the things when you get anxious, is that right? 

00:49:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:49:25
CAROLINE So, I want just to introduce a new technique which I think is gonna help me deal with some of those thoughts more effectively. 

00:49:30
ANDREW  All right. 

00:49:35
CAROLINE And the way that we're gonna do this is we're gonna take one of those thoughts and we're gonna look at the evidence for and against, each of the thoughts to see how true and how accurate they are. 

00:49:40
ANDREW Okay. 

00:49:40
CAROLINE The way we're gonna do this as if we were in a court of law, and a judge and a jury, we're gonna decide whether or not the thought was true or not. 

00:49:50
ANDREW All right. 

00:49:50
CAROLINE Okay, so we're gonna do that together now. So, can we take one of the examples off one of your diary sheets. That top one there you've got is, uhm, when you tried to phone the pizza company. 

00:50:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:50:00
CAROLINE Yeah? What was the thought that you got there? 

00:50:00
ANDREW That I wouldn't be able to speak. 

00:50:05
CAROLINE Okay. That sounded like a pretty scary situation, was it? 

00:50:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:50:05
CAROLINE Yeah? All right. Well, I'm gonna write the thought on this fletcher, "I won't be able to speak." 

00:50:15
[sil.] 

00:50:15
CAROLINE  Okay? And then I'm gonna write two columns: for and against. We're gonna look at the evidence, for and against, whether or not you could speak on the cell phone. 

00:50:35
ANDREW Okay. 

00:50:35
CAROLINE Yeah? Does that make a sense? 

00:50:35
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:50:35
CAROLINE As if we were in a court of law. Right then. So, what evidence you've got(ph) that you can't speak on the phone? 

00:50:40
ANDREW  I talked. But there aren't, I just, I just put down the phone. (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
CAROLINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
ANDREW Right(ph). I stuttered, it was wrong. 

00:50:55
CAROLINE Right, okay. So, when you tried to phone the pizza company... (crosstalk) 

00:50:55
CAROLINE  Yeah. 

00:51:00
ANDREW ...you just put the phone down? So, yeah. So, I mean, you've given thought, okay. So when you tried to phone the pizza company, so, I'll just write pizza company there. Any other examples when you were not able to speak on the phone? 

00:51:10
ANDREW  No, not really, not before I started my exercises. 

00:51:20
CAROLINE Right. So, a lot of evidence there. Is there really certainly nothing else from, from the diary that you filled in? Okay then, let's have a look at the evidence "against" then. So let's have a look at any evidence you've got that you can speak on the telephone. Can you think of any examples? 

00:51:35
ANDREW Uh hmm. I've got none. 

00:51:40
CAROLINE None at all? Right now, look through your, through your diaries that you've been filling in the past few weeks. Can you see any, any evidence at all that you can speak on the telephone? 

00:51:45
ANDREW  Oh yeah, I phoned my gran, the, I phoned my grandma. 

00:51:50
CAROLINE Oh yeah, that one there. You phoned your gran, didn't you? Okay, so I'm gonna put, I'm gonna put gran there. Okay, excellent. Any other examples on your diaries of when you've, might just speak on the telephone. 

00:52:00
ANDREW  No. Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
CAROLINE  What about, uhm, what about this past week? 

00:52:10
ANDREW  Oh, I phoned in, I phoned you three times. 

00:52:20
CAROLINE You did, didn't you? 

00:52:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:52:20
CAROLINE Yeah? And how many times did you speak to me this week? 

00:52:20
ANDREW  About seven, seven or eight. 

00:52:25
CAROLINE Not bad. Seven or eight times, wasn't it? So, let's put Caroline there then, "Caroline times seven," okay. Did you phone anybody else that works here this week? 

00:52:35
ANDREW No. 

00:52:35
CAROLINE  Are you sure? It wasn't just me you spoke to this week on the telephone. 

00:52:40
ANDREW : Oh, yeah, I phoned, I talked to your secretary this week. 

00:52:45
CAROLINE You did, didn't you? 

00:52:45
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:52:45
CAROLINE And, and did you actually speak to her? 

00:52:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:52:50
CAROLINE Yeah? 

00:52:50
ANDREW Yeah, and I've told her my name. 

00:52:50
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:52:50
ANDREW She asked me to leave a message so. (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
CAROLINE  So you said your name on the telephone as well. You left a message, yeah? How many times did you that this week? 

00:52:55
ANDREW Uhm, twice. 

00:53:00
CAROLINE Twice, okay. Did you message, phone anybody else this week on that new posh mobile phone of yours that you've got? 

00:53:10
ANDREW Uhm, well, I phoned in John as well. 

00:53:15
CAROLINE Okay? 

00:53:15
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:53:20
CAROLINE You phoned John? 

00:53:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:53:20
CAROLINE Yeah? How many times this week? 

00:53:20
ANDREW I don't know. About, probably one to twi, twice, I think, yeah, twice. 

00:53:25
CAROLINE Twice, okay, great start. You've got a number of examples there. Anybody else that you might just speak to on the telephone that you can remember and see through looking through your diaries? 

00:53:40
ANDREW  Only the, and picked up the phone. 

00:53:50
CAROLINE Okay, yeah, you mentioned it. You answered the phone didn't you, there? Who was that calling? Can you remember? 

00:53:55
ANDREW Paul, I think. 

00:53:55
CAROLINE Paul? Okay, so you might just speak to Paul and phoned as well. 

00:54:00
"I won't be able to speak" For Pizza Company Against Gran Caroline x 7 Secretary x 2 John x 2 Paul 

00:54:00
CAROLINE All right then, do you think that's everybody? 

00:54:00
ANDREW  That looks okay. 

00:54:05
CAROLINE Okay, so we got a seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen people that you spoke to on telephone. Thirteen different occasions, you've managed to speak on the telephone. You told me there wasn't any evidence. That's not bad, is it? 

00:54:15
ANDREW No. 

00:54:15
CAROLINE No. Okay, so we're gonna, 13 times there. And then we just got this one bit of evidence that says that you won't be able to speak on the phone well. All right, so look at this evidence again, okay. 'Coz remember, this is got to be evidence that stands within the court of law, all right? 

00:54:30
ANDREW All right. 

00:54:30
CAROLINE So, you told me that you would, you were able to speak when you tried to phone the pizza company. So, as soon as you got that thought when the person answered the telephone, what did you do? 

00:54:40
ANDREW Put down the phone. 

00:54:45
CAROLINE So, did you actually try to speak on the telephone? 

00:54:45
ANDREW No. 

00:54:45
CAROLINE No? Not really? You didn't really give yourself a chance. How'd you know whether you would've been able to or not? 

00:54:50
ANDREW  I don't. 

00:54:55
CAROLINE You don't really do. So we can't stand up in the court of law? 

00:55:00
ANDREW I guess not, no. 

00:55:00
CAROLINE No, okay. So I'm gonna put a question mark by this bit of evidence, because I don't think this evidence is as good as all this evidence. And we got 13 examples of you being able to speak on the telephone, yeah? So if you were the jury in this case, and you are to decide whether or not Andrew could speak on telephone or not, what conclusion would you come to with that? 

00:55:20
ANDREW "Against" wins but I've got more proof. 

00:55:25
CAROLINE Right, you've got more proof that you can speak on the telephone than you can't. 

00:55:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:55:30
CAROLINE Yeah. So if you were gonna pick up the phone again, will you more likely to be able to speak or more like it's not (inaudible )? 

00:55:40
ANDREW More able to speak, I think, yeah. 

00:55:40
CAROLINE Okay, brilliant. Well done.

00:55:45
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON By this stage, Andrew had been filling in his diary for some time and had been involved in a number of behavioral experiments. Despite this, he needed a lot of help to come up with any positive evidence whatsoever. And the therapist needed to adopt a firm directive approach. The judge and jury technique is a useful way of introducing a thought diary. Although not demonstrated on the video, this is explained to Andrew and set as a homework task. 

00:56:10
Cognitive techniques for challenging anxious thoughts Judge and jury technique Pie charts Survey method 

00:56:10
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The pie chart technique holds as another strategy for challenging beliefs. The aim is to get the young person to recognize that most situations can be interpreted in a variety of different ways, and that his own negative interpretation is unlikely to be shown by many other people. In the following clip, therapist writes Andrew's own interpretation. "People will think I'm stupid," at the bottom of the list. The reasons for this soon become apparent. 

00:56:35
CAROLINE So Andrew, you think that if you pause when you phone someone, you're worried that, that person might think that you're stupid? 

00:56:45
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
CAROLINE That's right, isn't it? And that's not very nice thinking now, is it? Well, I'd like also to think about, 'bout together because I think that it's so important on the phone, there might be lots of things that people could think. So, could we work together on drawing up a list? 

00:57:00
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:57:05
CAROLINE Yeah? Does that sound okay? So, I'm gonna write off, first of all, "Don't think I'm stupid." 

00:57:15
[sil.] 

00:57:15
CAROLINE  Okay. But I'd also like you to just come up with some other ideas as well. 

00:57:20
ANDREW  Yeah. 

00:57:25
CAROLINE All right? So, let's say for example that you phoned somebody and they pause on the phone, what might you think? 

00:57:30
ANDREW  I don't know, maybe ah, maybe the phone is broke. 

00:57:35
CAROLINE That's a very good idea. Yeah, maybe the phone is broken. So, let's put that idea on here. The phone is broken. Okay? You phoned somebody up. There's a pause, what else might you think? What else could be broken? 

00:57:50
ANDREW  Don't(ph), and ah. 

00:58:00
CAROLINE Well, what else is it about a phone, it's not just the phone is there? What else might be? 

00:58:05
ANDREW Signal? Like it, its lines. 

00:58:05
CAROLINE Yeah. Okay, the signal might be broken, great. Signal down. Okay. What are the reasons might it be for people pausing on the telephone? 

00:58:20
ANDREW I Don't know what to say? Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
CAROLINE Is that all you can think of? 

00:58:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:58:20
CAROLINE Well, I try and, I'll try and help to see if we can come up with some more things together. 

00:58:25
ANDREW All right. 

00:58:25
CAROLINE And what are the things might people struggle with when they're on the telephone? Why might they pause? They be just talking. What, why, what reasons do you have to pause in a conversation? 

00:58:40
ANDREW Thinking about what to say? 

00:58:40
CAROLINE  Yeah. That's a really good example, you might just have been gotten what you're gonna say or try to think the right words, yeah? 

00:58:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:58:50
CAROLINE Okay. 

00:58:55
[sil.] 

00:58:55
CAROLINE  What about when you phoned one of your mates? I'm, you're talking to once(ph) to them and then suddenly then pause. They're not talking but you can hear chatting. What, what other things might have happened for that to have paused in the background? What could have happened? 

00:59:10
ANDREW  Don't know, somebody put him off? 

00:59:15
CAROLINE  Right. Yeah. He'd been distracted by somebody else. 

00:59:20
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
CAROLINE Yeah? That's sounds like a good idea, great. So, distracted by somebody else. Can you think of any other things that might cause there to be a pause on the telephone? Just think about one when you made phone calls. What are the things that sometimes gone wrong? 

00:59:45
ANDREW Don't know, don't know, just dialed the wrong number or something. 

00:59:55
CAROLINE Right. Have you ever, have you ever pressed the wrong button? 

00:59:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

00:59:55
CAROLINE  Yeah. When you've, when you've been, on your mobile, whoever, and you accidentally put somebody at fault after all. They just go quiet for a bit. Yeah? 

01:00:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:00:05
CAROLINE That's quite easy to understand that. So, you might press the wrong button. 

01:00:10
[sil.] 

01:00:10
CAROLINE  Okay? Can you think of any other reasons why there might be a pause? 

01:00:20
ANDREW  No, I don't know, uhm, no. 

01:00:25
CAROLINE  No? What about by the thing, you got the phone is broken, the signal might be down, someone might forgotten what to say, they might be distracted, you might press the wrong button and, what about, what about, and you're just kinda thinking how to word something? (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:00:45
CAROLINE Do you ever do that? Yeah. 

01:00:45
ANDREW Do it all, thinking about what to say. 

01:00:45
CAROLINE  Yeah. Thinking about what to say, is that how to actually say it. Could it cross you? 

01:00:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:00:50
CAROLINE So, not a good one. 

01:01:00
[sil.] 

01:01:00
CAROLINE  Have you ever told somebody or couldn't thought you got the wrong number? Maybe you do not? 

01:01:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:01:10
CAROLINE You know, I have a few times. 

01:01:10
ANDREW  Yeah? 

01:01:15
CAROLINE Yeah. And you stop. It stops you, doesn't it? You might just 'bout to say something like, "oh gosh," not sure that's all right. So, you might think you got a wrong number. 

01:01:25
[sil.] 

01:01:25
CAROLINE  Anything else you can think of that might explain why someone pauses on the telephone? 

01:01:35
ANDREW No. 

01:01:35
CAROLINE  No? 

01:01:40
ANDREW I might, I don't know. Not thinking anything? 

01:01:40
CAROLINE Right. You might not actually think anything. Might even notice, might they? But people pause all the time. People don't think anything, do they? So, might not think anything. So quite I couldn't list that in another way you've got the phone's broken, the signal down, might forgotten what to say, might be distracted, might press the wrong button, might be thinking what to say, might think you got the wrong number, might don't think anything at all, and of course, you've got the thought, they might think I'm stupid. So, there's a lot of different reasons or lots of different things that people might think if they had to pause on the phone. So, what am I to do now is we gonna draw a pie chart. Now, have you done pie charts in school? 

01:02:25
ANDREW Yeah. But I hate maths. 

01:02:25
CAROLINE You hate maths do you? 

01:02:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:02:25
CAROLINE Okay. I promise you, it's not gonna be as difficult as math. Okay? I'll draw a pie chart here for you, in fact, let's make this a piece of chart, especially for you, 'coz I know, I found you are fall into pieces. Yeah? So this piece, it represents a hundred people. Now, have you ever seen that program from the Fortunes? Yeah, and what they do is they ask a hundred people a particular question and see what, (crosstalk) 

01:02:45
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:02:45
CAROLINE  ah, answers they come up with and make lots of different answers, yeah? You mark out a hundred how many people said which answer. Well, that's we're gonna do with these reasons that you've given me of why people might pause on telephone. 

01:03:00
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

01:03:00
CAROLINE Okay? So, let's take the first re, reason that you gave me, which was the, the phones might be broken. How many people out of a hundred do you think, might think that? 

01:03:05
ANDREW  I don't know, 'bout, 

01:03:10
CAROLINE  We ask a hundred people. 

01:03:15
ANDREW I think it with (inaudible ) 30. 

01:03:20
CAROLINE About 30? 

01:03:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:03:20
CAROLINE Okay. So, this represents a hundred people. Thirty must be about, hmm, I don't know. Something like that, yeah? So we got 30 people, phone is broken. Yeah. Okay, let's look at the next thing. We've got the signal being down. How many people out of a hundred do you think might think it's because the signal was down? 

01:03:40
ANDREW  'Bout 10. 

01:03:45
CAROLINE  About 10? 

01:03:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:03:50
CAROLINE Yeah. Okay then. So, some people think it has to do with the signal. Yeah. Okay, the next reason we've got is that, they might think that the person has forgotten what to say. How many people out of a hundred do you think might think that? 

01:04:05
ANDREW Twenty. 

01:04:05
CAROLINE About 20? 

01:04:05
ANDREW  Yeah. 

01:04:10
CAROLINE Yeah? Okay then. Twenty people think forgot what to say. Okay, next thing we've got down is that the person was distracted. How many people out of a hundred do you think might give that answer might think that? 

01:04:25
ANDREW Fifteen. 

01:04:25
CAROLINE About 15? Okay, distracted. Next one, we've got, ah, pressed the wrong number. How many people out of a hundred do you think we've got 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, so we've only got 25 people left. How many people do you think might think... (crosstalk) 

01:04:45
ANDREW  About 20. 

01:04:50
CAROLINE That pressed the wrong number, about 20? 

01:04:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:04:50
CAROLINE  Okay. 

01:05:00
[sil.] 

01:05:00
CAROLINE  And how many people do you think might be thinking what to say? 

01:05:05
ANDREW  I don't know. Five(ph)? I don't know. Five? I don't know. 

01:05:15
CAROLINE You don't know? 

01:05:20
ANDREW No. 

01:05:20
CAROLINE We'll let's say it's five because actually, we'd filled up our pizza, anyway, at this point. 

01:05:25
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
CAROLINE Which actually would now have a hundred people. And yet, we still got all these reasons. We still got thinking they got the wrong number, might not be thinking anything, and we still got this thought here, which is the one you first gave us. There's no people left out on the hundred to even think that you're stupid 'coz you pause on the phone. So how light did you think is now that someone might actually think is because you're stupid? 

01:05:45
ANDREW Hardly ever? 

01:05:45
CAROLINE Right, hardly ever, not that many really. 

01:05:50
ANDREW All right. 

01:05:50
CAROLINE Does that sound right? 

01:05:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:05:50
CAROLINE  We've come up with lots of things that people might think when you pause on the telephone. And with the stop list there, there's not really many people you think you're stupid when you pause on the phone. But you have said that there'll(ph) always be one or two, and I think you're probably right. There always will be one or two people who might think that. 

01:06:10
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON When a young person's negative beliefs are very strong, they often find it difficult to imagine alternatives. The therapist, therefore, had to work hard to get Andrew to come up with any ideas and not to be cut off by his reticence. While the pie chart technique was useful in demonstrating to Andrew that his worries were exaggerated, they were clearly not entirely without foundation. In the next clip, the therapist returns to his worry, helping him to explore what it would mean for him if someone did think he was stupid for pausing on the phone. 

01:06:40
CAROLINE We've come up with lots of things that people might think when you pause on the telephone. And with the stop list that, there's not really many people who think you're stupid when you pause on the phone. But you have said that there'll(ph) always be one or two, and I think you're probably right. There always will be one or two people who might think that. Okay. So, that's, let's (inaudible ) think about together. Let's say, uhm, the guy at the pizza place, when you phoned to order your pizza, you pause and he thinks you're stupid. How, how would that make you feel? Yeah(ph). 

01:07:15
ANDREW  Stupid or embarrassed? 

01:07:20
CAROLINE Yeah. You'd feel embarrassed and stupid and not, and that's not very nice at all. But what, what if you think about is, does it really matter if the guy at the pizza place whom you've never met, I assume, thinks that you're stupid because you pause on the phone. Does it matter? 

01:07:35
ANDREW  I guess not, no. 

01:07:40
CAROLINE It doesn't matter to you much, does it? What does that say about, about aim as a person then? 

01:07:45
ANDREW  Don't know. 

01:07:50
CAROLINE What kind of person do you think he might be if you think he's stupid? 

01:07:50
ANDREW  An ass, don't know(ph). 

01:07:55
CAROLINE Uh hmm. Might not be very nice person. 

01:07:55
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

01:07:55
CAROLINE And so, are you really bothered to a, a not very nice person (inaudible )? 

01:08:02
ANDREW  No. 

01:08:05
CAROLINE No. You're probably less bothered, aren't you really? 

01:08:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:08:05
CAROLINE What if it was the, the other way around? Let's say the pizza man paused on the phone. And you heard him paused. What would you think about him? Would you think he was stupid? 

01:08:15
ANDREW No. 

01:08:15
CAROLINE What would you think? 

01:08:20
ANDREW He was distracted (inaudible ) really. 

01:08:22
CAROLINE Right. You think something else, wouldn't you be? You won't think he's stupid. And why is that? 

01:08:25
ANDREW I don't know. 

01:08:25
CAROLINE  Well, I think is 'coz you're a nice person, you see. And you don't think those kind of horrible things. So, are you convinced by that then that actually, if someone thinks you're stupid, probably it tells you more about them than it does you. 

01:08:40
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:08:40
CAROLINE Yeah? So, you're perhaps not worried about what some people think about you(ph)? 

01:08:45
ANDREW For everyone notable, for if it's someone like Will(ph) at our school, he used to be one, really cool. 

01:08:50
CAROLINE Right. So, Will(ph) is somebody who's really cool at school and his opinion matters to you more than the guy at the pizza (inaudible )? 

01:09:01
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:09:01
CAROLINE Yeah. Let's all think about that. I guess, it would be really nice, wouldn't it, if everybody like us all the time? 

01:09:05
ANDREW  Hmm. 

01:09:10
CAROLINE I'd like that, I'd like everybody to like me all the time. But do you that's really possible? 

01:09:15
ANDREW That's not, hmm. 

01:09:15
CAROLINE  Do you like everybody all of the time? 

01:09:20
ANDREW No. 

01:09:20
CAROLINE No (laughs). So, that's not very realistic, is it really? 

01:09:25
ANDREW No. 

01:09:25
CAROLINE It'd be good and it's what we don't want but it's not very realistic, unfortunately. You know, I'd like everybody at work to like me all of the time but I know they don't. I know that some people like me more than others. And I guess it must be like that for you at school as well. So I guess, there comes a point where you just have to think, so what? And you might even tell yourself, well, I'm not gonna let those kind of people get me down. Do you think maybe you can do that? 

01:09:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:09:55
CAROLINE Yeah? Okay. 

01:09:55
Being Prepared Problem solving Role play Rehearsal Use of positive self statements Examining feared outcomes 

01:09:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  Although the issue is only addressed briefly on the clip, the therapist can employ a range of approach as to help prepare a young person to face difficult situations. For instance, role play, problem solving, and self talk. These are highlighted in the "Being Prepared" section of the manual. 

01:10:15
Cognitive techniques for challenging anxious thoughts Judge and jury technique Pie charts Survey method 

01:10:15
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The Survey technique, this method encourages Andrew to directly check out all the people's views and perspectives. Again, the question needs to be very carefully chosen, and the therapist needs to help Andrew identify people who are likely to challenge rather than reinforce his current beliefs. 

01:10:35
CAROLINE Well, Andrew, I think you've done really well in making all these phone calls. But there is one thing that you still get really anxious about, and that's phone-in for pizza, isn't it? Yeah? Well, I think that lots of people get anxious when they phone off for take-away. I know that I do. I don't know why. I just seems to be one of those things. I always think I could have been(ph) forget what to order. So, do you think all the people get anxious as well? 

01:10:55
ANDREW  No, but not like I do. 

01:11:00
CAROLINE Right. So you think you get more anxious than other people, yeah? 

01:11:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:11:05
CAROLINE Okay. Well, what I'd like you to do is to just test that out. I'm gonna set up a home practice for you. What I'd really like you to do is to go home and ask 10 people that you know quite well, whether or not they get anxious when they call off for take-away, yeah? 

01:11:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:11:20
CAROLINE Do you think you could do that? 

01:11:20
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:11:20
CAROLINE So we need to think together about 10 people that you could ask that question to. So who do you think you could ask? 

01:11:25
ANDREW  I'll ask my mom and dad, and our Kate, my sister. 

01:11:30
CAROLINE Okay. So that's three people. Actually, you can ask 10. What about, what about your mates at school? Could you ask them? 

01:11:35
ANDREW  I can do but they'll think I'm a stupid. 

01:11:40
CAROLINE Do you think you could, uhm, yeah, we don't want them to think that, do we? Do you think you could just tell them that it's like a math homework or something like that? 

01:11:50
ANDREW Yeah, (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
CAROLINE Yeah? 

01:11:50
ANDREW I suppose I will. 

01:11:50
CAROLINE Did it fall for that one? 

01:11:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:11:50
CAROLINE  Okay. So, that's five people we've got. We need another five people that you could ask. 

01:11:55
ANDREW I've, I've got some cousins I could ask. 

01:12:00
CAROLINE How many cousins have you got? 

01:12:00
ANDREW Uhm, three. 

01:12:05
CAROLINE Three? 

01:12:05
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:12:05
CAROLINE Okay. That would be good. So you need two more people for your list. 

01:12:10
ANDREW I could ask Mark. He's my sister's boyfriend. 

01:12:15
CAROLINE Okay. That's a good idea, yeah? 

01:12:15
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:12:15
CAROLINE One more. 

01:12:20
ANDREW Uhm, I don't know. I don't know anybody. 

01:12:20
CAROLINE  What about your gran? 

01:12:25
ANDREW Oh, yeah... (crosstalk) 

01:12:25
CAROLINE Yeah? 

01:12:25
ANDREW ...from my gran. 

01:12:25
CAROLINE Could you ask your gran? 

01:12:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:12:25
CAROLINE Okay. So that's 10 people. And I just want you to ask them whether or not they get anxious when they phone for pizza. 

01:12:35
ANDREW All right. 

01:12:35
CAROLINE Okay? And then I want you to bring out this back next week. And we'll have a chat about it. 

01:12:40
ANDREW Okay. 

01:12:40
CAROLINE Okay? 

01:12:40
CAROLINE So Andrew last week, I asked you to do some home practice for me, and you are gonna conduct the survey and ask 10 people whether or not they felt anxious... (crosstalk) 

01:12:50
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:12:50
CAROLINE ...when they phone for take-away, yeah? Did you manage to do that? 

01:12:50
ANDREW  Yeah. 

01:12:55
CAROLINE Great. Have you got a list there for me then? 

01:12:55
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:12:55
CAROLINE So how many people, ah, of the 10 that you asked said yes they got anxious when they phone for take-away? 

01:13:00
ANDREW  Uhm, eight. 

01:13:05
CAROLINE Eight people out of 10. 

01:13:10
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:13:10
CAROLINE Yeah? Were you surprised by that? 

01:13:10
ANDREW Yeah. I, I couldn't believe Jordan not nervous when he phoned at the pizzas and stuff like that 'coz Jordan is a little girl(ph). 

01:13:15
CAROLINE  Right. Yeah, who's Ethan? Is he from different school or is he one of your cousins? 

01:13:20
ANDREW He's one of my cousins. 

01:13:20
CAROLINE All right. 

01:13:20
ANDREW Hmm. 

01:13:20
CAROLINE  So you're really surprised that, that he said he got anxious as well, yeah? 

01:13:25
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:13:25
CAROLINE Okay. So, so how did that make you feel then? 

01:13:30
ANDREW Well, probably, made me, made me feel like more confident. 

01:13:35
CAROLINE Right. Okay. And how did you find just doing the, the home practice anyway, asking all those people? 

01:13:40
ANDREW  I got a bit nervous about asking my friends, but, (crosstalk) 

01:13:45
CAROLINE Okay. 

01:13:45
ANDREW  but once I, I explained to them that, well, told them that I'd be doing it for the maths. 

01:13:55
CAROLINE Right. Okay. That's good. 

01:13:55
ANDREW They are. 

01:13:55
CAROLINE And so I, ah, all 10 of them said that they felt anxious when they phone for take-away as well, yeah? 

01:14:00
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:14:00
CAROLINE Did any of them have the same thoughts that you get? 

01:14:00
ANDREW  I don't know 'coz I didn't, I didn't wanna tell them about it. 

01:14:10
CAROLINE All right. Okay. Did any of them just say, "Yeah, sometimes, ah, I'm worried to people who think I'm stupid," did anybody say that to you? 

01:14:15
ANDREW Paul said that when he, when he phones off for the pizza, that I don't(ph) like pizza shop. 

01:14:20
CAROLINE Yeah. 

01:14:20
ANDREW And he just says he can't, his words don't come out so. (crosstalk) 

01:14:25
CAROLINE Right. Okay. So do you think that he worries about that sometimes? 

01:14:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:14:30
CAROLINE Yeah. So how does that make you feel then? 

01:14:35
ANDREW More normal. 

01:14:35
CAROLINE Right. 

01:14:35
ANDREW I feel like I'm fitting in a lot better. 

01:14:35
CAROLINE  Right. So you're just like everybody else? 

01:14:40
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:14:40
CAROLINE So that sounds like it was a usual thing to do, yeah? 

01:14:40
ANDREW Uh hmm. 

01:14:40
CAROLINE  Well done. 

01:14:45
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON Andrew was surprised by the responses he got. The effect of the exercise is quite powerful, clearly convincing him that his fears were neither unusual nor abnormal. 

01:14:55
EXPOSURE Behavioural experiments & graded exposure Relapse prevention 

01:14:55
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON The final scene shows the end of therapy. Andrew has not completed the program of exposure. And although he still find some situations difficult, he's no longer avoiding them and is feeling increasingly confident about dealing with them. In order to prepare the young person to the ending of therapy, at least one session should be spent considering relapse prevention. The aim of this session is to review what has been achieved and to prepare the young person for future problems by helping him identify the skills he has now and how he can put them into practice. The following items are a list of ideas that may be helpful. Each one should be taken in turn and the young person should write down an action plan for future reference. Watch out for avoidance. It is easy to slip back into a patterns of behaviour, so the young person is encouraged to keep doing the activities identified on the hierarchy. Watch out for negative thoughts, and remember to challenge them. The young person is not expected to continue keeping diaries, but it is hoped that they will, they will now be more aware of the negative thoughts and be more able to seek evidence to challenge them. Use positive coping self-statements, such as, "I don't look as bad as I think I do." Joint therapy, many people identify key thoughts that help them to cope in difficult situations. It is often helpful to write these down and remember them for future reference. Keep diaries and remember to look at them. Diaries are an excellent source of evidence of what the young person has achieved. They are encouraged to keep these in a safe place until referred to them when facing new and difficult situations. Think "what would my therapist say?" It is often useful to think about a difficult situation from another person's perspective. The therapist invites Andrew to try this in the following clip. 

01:16:40
CAROLINE  Well, Andrew, we've spent most of today's session talking about how well you've done for over the past few weeks 'coz I think you feel a lot less anxious now and you handle the situations a lot better, aren't you? But there's just one final thing that I'd like us to have a go at to really make sure that you're prepared when you go out into the big wide world on your own. Okay? 

01:17:00
ANDREW Okay. 

01:17:00
CAROLINE And one thing that a lot of people find useful when they're in difficult, anxious situation is you try and think what I might say to them in that situation to help. Okay? So what I'd like us to do now is to do a bit of, ah, role reversal really. So I want you to be me, and I'm going to be you. (crosstalk) 

01:17:20
ANDREW All right. 

01:17:20
CAROLINE Does that make sense? And now, let's talk about a situation that, ah, I think you find still quite difficult which is reading out in class. 

01:17:25
ANDREW All right. 

01:17:25
CAROLINE Does that sound all right? 

01:17:30
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:17:30
CAROLINE So when do you start to feel anxious when you read out in class? When is the first, you start feeling to get a bit nervous? 

01:17:35
ANDREW I don't know. Only it's coming up to my turn. 

01:17:35
CAROLINE  Right. Okay. So someone else is reading, and you know that you're next. You start to get those, those soft feelings, yeah? 

01:17:45
ANDREW Yeah. 

01:17:45
CAROLINE Okay. So I'm gonna start to be you from now on then, and you're gonna try and say things that you think I might say to you to help. Is that all right? 

01:17:50
ANDREW Okay, then. 

01:17:50
CAROLINE Okay. So, uhm, well, I just, I can't do it. 

01:17:55
ANDREW Well, but you've done it before. And if you can remember your breathing exercises, you should be okay. 

01:18:00
CAROLINE  But I know that the words just won't come out. 

01:18:05
ANDREW Well, have you got any proof of that happening since you've started your, your new exercises? 

01:18:10
CAROLINE  Hmm. Not really. But, I'm just trying, I'm just trying to make a fool of myself. 

01:18:20
ANDREW Well, have you ever made a fool of yourself before? 

01:18:20
CAROLINE  Hmm. I guess not, but that could happen. 

01:18:25
ANDREW Have you got any, (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
CAROLINE And got me to fool myself. 

01:18:30
ANDREW have you got any proof to suggest that you might... (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
CAROLINE  Well... (crosstalk) 

01:18:35
ANDREW ...make fool of yourself? 

01:18:35
CAROLINE I suppose I didn't look to about on the videos that we did. I thought it looked worse. 

01:18:40
ANDREW And you picked up the phone quite well, didn't you? 

01:18:45
CAROLINE Uh hmm. 

01:18:45
ANDREW You're very capable of doing that. 

01:18:45
CAROLINE Yeah. I did, did manage to do that. Suppose it wasn't, wasn't quite as bad as I thought. Well, everyone, I'm just worried that everyone is gonna think I'm stupid even if can do it. 

01:18:55
ANDREW But, I know you said like, like you don't care. I mean, you do care if your friends think you're stupid... (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
CAROLINE Uh hmm. 

01:19:05
ANDREW ...and you don't care if the pizza man thinks you're stupid. But how like may(ph) is it that you gonna make a fool of you, yourself, and your friends will think you're stupid? 

01:19:10
CAROLINE  Well, those of my friends will think I'm stupid because they're my friends, really. So, I guess that's not too bad. 

01:19:20
ANDREW So then you've got no proof to suggest that you're gonna make a fool of yourself, have you? 

01:19:25
CAROLINE  No, I, I suppose not. 

01:19:30
ANDREW No? 

01:19:30
CAROLINE  I suppose I can always do me, my breathing exercises. 

01:19:35
ANDREW That's right. Practice your breathing exercises, and just keep telling yourself that you can do it. So have you got, is there anything else that you could look at to like reinsure yourself that you've, you won't make a fool of yourself? Have you ever done anything or recorded it? 

01:19:50
CAROLINE Well, I've always got my diaries that... (crosstalk) 

01:19:55
ANDREW Yeah? 

01:19:55
CAROLINE ...we fold to that, that I can look at, look all of things that I have to know over the past few weeks. 

01:19:55
ANDREW  Have you noticed about the anxiety numbers since you started and since till now? 

01:20:05
CAROLINE Well, they've gone down. 

01:20:05
ANDREW Yeah? 

01:20:05
CAROLINE Yeah, starts out really high, but the more I practice, the more they have come down. 

01:20:10
ANDREW And if you keep looking at your, your anxiety diaries, you'll see how you've got better. 

01:20:15
CAROLINE Absolutely, yeah. That's, that's absolutely right. Do you want a job? You make a really good therapist. 

01:20:20
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON It is expected that the young person playing the therapist will be quite clumsy and concrete. However, it is important for the therapist playing the young person to model successful and appropriate responses to these fledgling attempts of becoming one's own therapist. The role reversal exercise forced Andrew to review the skills he had to his disposal, particularly in relation to thought challenging. Andrew offered a number of strategies, and his comment suggested that he had taken on board many of the concepts introduced by the therapist. Andrew mentioned using the diary as evidence of previous successes. Although most young people will no longer keep a diary after therapy has ended. It continues to be a valuable resource, which a young person can refer to at times of difficulty. As Andrew pointed out, he not only provides evidence, which, which can be used in thought challenging, but also offers to remind of the progress a young person made in bringing down his anxiety levels. Note that at the end of the session, the therapist was at pains to come fair her confidence in Andrew's ability to cope on his own. As mentioned earlier, it is often helpful to make a formal plan, which the young person can take away and refer to when difficulties arise. Well, they're not demonstrated here. An example of such a plan is included in the manual. 

01:21:35
SAM CARTWRIGHT-HATTON  You have found the video useful and would like to remind you that the scenes are intended to illustrate particular skills and techniques, and do not show real therapy sessions or a full course of therapy. For example, many of the sessions with Andrew centered on a single of goal of being able to phone friends. In a real therapy situation, the other goals he had to identify would also be tackled, either serially or in parallel. Similarly, Andrew's mother only appeared in the first session, even though parental involvement is an integral part of therapy. In the real clinical settings, a therapist would have been meeting with Andrew's mother separately, explaining the therapeutic approach, discussing how she could support him at home, and addressing any concerns that she may have. Well, with parents, clearly brings up issues of confidentiality, but we have not addressed this specifically in the video since they are common to all therapeutic work with children and adolescents. We have shown both Katy and Andrew making fairly steady progress through the program. However, in real life, things are not always so straightforward. The troubleshooting section in the manual covers some of the more common problems encountered in therapy. These can also be explored during supervision, and we would like to emphasize again the importance of regular supervision for anyone using a CBT approach. Most of the handouts and visual aids shown on the video can be found in the manual, along with more detailed descriptions of each session. We hope that you'll find the CBT Programme useful when working with children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.
