Hi Joe. 

00:00:25
JOE Hi. 

00:00:25
TIMOTHY WRIGHT A small few of us left with some kind of developmental disability. All of us enjoy picnics on one day. Those of us who are disabled often live separate lives. Thousands are still in the institution of the last two centuries. Many are sequestered protected from the world by their families. One form of enlightenment has helped some to gain a measure of independence by congregating them in group homes. That’s been okay as far as it goes. The theme human, we always want as much as we can have. 

00:00:55
LYNNE SEAGLE We want to be independent, we want to be free (inaudible ) direct our destinies. I mean, people with disabilities were enculturated same way we are. 

00:01:10
TIMOTHY WRIGHT The people of Hope House foundation in Norfolk, Virginia have put forth a simple premise for thinking about and helping to enhance the quality of the lives for those who are developmentally disabled. It is that a life one’s own to live to the best of one’s ability and with the respect of others there is a human right and a responsibility for all of us. This is about one way in which that can be realized. 

00:01:30
All of Us 

00:01:35
LYNNE SEAGLE hope house foundations – norfolk I have a very strong memory of being in school… in high school and there was a girl in the school named Barbara who now in retrospect I believe had a developmental disability or had mental retardation and um, she was treated very badly. In fact, I don’t remember really recall any one being very kind to her. The teasing was really wicked and um, no one… no one really befriended her. They mad fun of her and I was part of doing that. And she had had a particularly rough bus ride um… and I can’t really remember the specifics as much about what all of the kids were doing which I’m sure I know I was you know, joining in. But I do recall when she got off the bus in front of her house she just crying just so hard. Looking up at us and just crying so hard. And I got it. Hmmm… I got it then, you know. 

00:02:40

00:02:45
TIMOTHY WRIGHT Some of us have Down syndrome, visible in faces that are often able to show joy and sorrow more easily then the rest of us. But Down syndrome comes with other complications. And some times, a shorter life. Connie Cunnup lost her hips a few years ago but she moves now to the rhythm of the church that is important to her as she did when she could stand on her own. 

00:03:05
TRUMAN CLOSE sunday school teacher And Connie being the… the dramatic person that she is with… with you know, wave music with her hands sitting you know in her pue, we would stand and she would lead music, you know and sing and she would like to notice that people were watching her as she was doing this. So, at least well, at least as long as I’ve known her, she has been in love with hope house. To help people like Connie be able to live in an apartment on her own to assist her with all her activities. 

00:03:40

00:03:45
TIMOTHY WRIGHT Autism is a disability in which thought and perception seem to be illusive and disengaged. Quinton Riddick is a reader and traveler like many individual with autism, he presents us with a mystery. 

00:03:55
QUINTON RIDDICK That’s what in the newspaper. 

00:03:55
JENNIFER REED Okay. 

00:03:55
QUINTON RIDDICK Okay. 

00:03:55
JENNIFER REED So we are getting today? 

00:04:00
QUINTON RIDDICK Yeah. 

00:04:00
JENNIFER REED Alright. 

00:04:00
JENNIFER REED hope house foundation Quinton has a lot of what we call surveillant(ph) kind of things that he does and he has really good memory um, has incredible amounts of information that he just kinda keeps um, he likes to collect newspapers and he knows pretty much like the name of very city that… if you name any city he knows the name of the newspaper that’s printed there. He knows like if you say what your birthday is he can tell you what day it falls on. Like, he really likes calendars and keeps up with schedules and stuff like that. 

00:04:40
[sil.] 

00:04:45
LYNNE SEAGLE Spirituality with people of disabilities… is um… is individualized as it is with people without. There are people I know, that we support that I find to be very to have a clear sense of their spirituality just as clear with senses their sexuality and there is others who… who seek that… who are seeking that and you can see that they are seeking that. It is important to for Connie to go to church. Some of that is… is… need, belief whatever. But I do know that the history with people of disabilities is for so long that was the only outlet. That was the only place to be, that was okay to be at. 

00:05:35
TRUMAN CLOSE They had really no place to worship and we worried about that because they were going to another church were they would basically go for coffee and donuts and there was no Sunday school class for them. We have a special education on Sunday where we talked about the special needs of people. Why can’t class members and put an emphasis on that and it help to bring more support and help that way to our special needs people. Um, but we’re all on special needs in the… the body of Christ is not complete and so every body is together in worshipping. 

00:06:20

00:06:40
TIMOTHY WRIGHT Each spring and fall Norfolk marks a change of seasons with the Stockley gardens art festival in a historic neighborhood park. It’s a fund raiser for hope house foundation but it also become an acknowledgment of the place of people with disabilities in the community. At City hall, the Mayor of Norfolk reflects in the last centuries movement to bring very one under the tent. 

00:07:00
PAUL FRAIM mayor of norfolk As our notion of what it is to be you know, participant in our community has expanded over the decades. It is included folks with disabilities and folks who are challenged and we have come to realize that our community is only as strong as we are inclusive of… of all of the participants here in this city. 

00:07:20
JEFF MILLER Any way you can support the community. You can support the community every way obviously. 

00:07:25
TIMOTHY WRIGHT Jeff Miller’s company sells heating oil in the neighborhood. It surrounds Stockley gardens. And that eventually led him to a seat on the hope house board of directors. 

00:07:30
JEFF MILLER miller oil company They all wanna have, they all wanna make a contribution. They all wanna be part of the community and are removing the labels that sometimes are put on these people. They… in support if you will whatever areas of weakness they may have they are able to contribute to the community and by taking that sort of progressive approach, it relieves pressure on institutions and gets people into their own homes. 

00:08:00
TOM LAIDLAW mental health, mental retardation, substance abuse services - virginia beach They are allowed or enabled to um, like experience life in the community and learn from their success as well as their mistakes just like the rest of us. Um, were which I think is um, of great benefit for the people who are being given the support but its also a benefit to other service providers to be able to see that some times its better to do a little bit less um, to help people achieve what we really on what people to achieve which is basically be able to have control um, over their own lives. 

00:08:40
KATRINA CUNNUP In so many ways, I see Connie as… as an adult totally capable of doing any thing and every thing she wants to do. In another ways I know that she is just a little girl and I… and times I love the fact that that they treat her like an adult, another times…. 

00:08:55
CONNIE CUNNUP Oh yeah. 

00:08:55
KATRINA CUNNUP …she is not an adult she is mentally 5-years-old. You know, do what she need to do and take care of her. But they cant because she is an adult and so it some times I get very aggravated. 

00:09:10
CONNIE CUNNUP Yeah. 

00:09:10
KATRINA CUNNUP …and Connie was there. 

00:09:10
CONNIE CUNNUP I know.

How about her preparing. 

00:09:45
Are you crazy(ph). 

00:09:50
TRUMAN CLOSE When she goes out she is not able to go places like she used to and get around like she used to. So I think that’s… that’s affected probably affected Connie and um, as we perceive it now I don’t know if Connie perceives it in a same way. 

00:10:05

00:10:15
Hello, I am going to a birthday party(ph) (inaudible ) 

00:10:25
JENNIFER REED Quinton has a really great sense of humor. I think in um, which is kind of rare for somebody with autism. He likes to joke about things and um, play games with words and you know, say you know certain things…

00:10:55
JENNIFER REED He a long time ago was started having problems with his kidneys and was seeing an kidney specialist. When he first, when Dr. Alan Furst(ph) knew that Quinton was gonna need dialysis he felt like he wont be able to handle it based on his disability and actually the first time that he was exposed to seeing a the floor of the dialysis unit he kind of freaked out and you know, said, ‘I’m not gonna do this’ and stuff like that so, Dr.Alan(ph) felt like he need to be institutionalized and live in a nursing home and um, we pretty much fought for him to be able to stay in his own home because he felt like you know that’s what he wanted to do. That we were able to kind of create a plan to desensitize him and get him used to be in on going on a dialysis and now he is at the point where he’ll go by himself, get picked up. You know, he is totally independent. So you know he was able to stay in the community. He… he had always like to collect newspapers and it started with him go and just on a small trip they went to Washington D.C him and another person. Her name is Valery(ph) that had taken him just kinda on a fluke like lets go, get a newspaper because he liked to buy newspapers from other places but that he’d never got out of town. So um, they said lets just go and they went and he had a really great time and it was almost like he just came out and came out of a shell and acted differently when he was out of town then when he was at home. So then we started just doing more trips and he had some extra money to spend and just brought it up for today’s show is his favorite show and so he said lets go meet Katie. He wanted to go and meet the whole of today’s show and that was at first it was kind of like a joke, like yeah lets go and we… you know, we were gonna go to New York and may be try it go the today show which we did and um, he actually get to meet Katie Couric. Then he just started saying, ‘Okay you know when is our next annual trip.’ Like it was already an annual tradition. So when is the next trip gonna be and you know being that he is sick, you know we um, you know wanna try to keep that going because we don’t know when you know the last time, its gonna be that he was gonna be able to go. So you know, we really wanna him to be able to go.

TIMOTHY WRIGHT At age 77, Lucinda Brown still actively perceive the life of regular volunteer work. A past winner of the JC Penney Golden Rule Award is volunteer of the year and her community. She has volunteered extensively in schools for disabled children. Today her life is celebrated by friends. 

00:14:30
KACY CONNORS-BOYTERS hope house foundation …has to be touched by her because she had um a rough upbringing, being 77-years-old and having learning disabilities all of her life without having to go to school, were without um having any kinda training or education. She just has that inner spirit that just sparkles and shines and… 

00:14:50

00:15:00
LUCINDA BROWN Yes, thank you. 

00:15:00
You are very welcome. 

00:15:00
KACY CONNORS-BOYTERS Both of her parents um, were (inaudible ) is the oldest of the children. Um, so she has somewhat it sounds like a speech and had how to manage(ph) times but its probably from her early beginnings, I’m assuming there was no documentation of this any where but just from being raised for so many years they would in the interior world and looking on the farm. 

00:15:20
…blue jacket. 

00:15:20
Yeah yeah. 

00:15:20
And I have to go to Wal-Mart and buy myself a red one. 

00:15:25
KACY CONNORS-BOYTERS I think she (inaudible ) the staff as taking care of her. I think she thinks that of it as taking care of us and she is right in a lot of aspect. She is all keeping us all of us in track. She is always asking us if our cars have gas and if your relationships were good and what's going on for your weekend. She has what are the fullest and busiest lives of anybody that I know. 

00:15:55

00:16:20
Thank you Quinton. Here we are.

EUNICE SHRIVER The award goes to Miss. Lynne Seagle. 

00:16:30
TIMOTHY WRIGHT The effort that help disabled people move from large sheltered institutions to group homes in their own communities has enhanced the quality of life for many. The hope house model has moved from that level of small neighborhood institution to single room mate living in regular apartment. 

00:16:45
joseph p. kennedy foundation awards 

00:16:45
TIMOTHY WRIGHT That advance was recognized by the Joseph P. Kennedy foundation in 1997. 

00:16:50
EUNICE SHRIVER …group mentally retarded people out of institutions and into group homes and from group homes into their own homes. She has successfully pushed the concept of independent living further than any one else in the world. 

00:17:05
LYNNE SEAGLE I think group homes are just smaller institutions. Peoples do segregate it, they are still isolated, they are still grouped and in a congregate way not based on interest, personality or even a vocational calling such us nuns who live together. Um, but just doing an IQ test I mean, I think is the most ridiculous thing to um, force people to live together based on their IQ or if you know be like saying you know, okay everybody with eyeglasses you now have to live together. Are you happy? You’ve got the same disability, I mean this what I think it makes no sense to me. 

00:17:50
Behind the over these pictures that you might be able to… to see here two very young sisters. (inaudible ) President Kennedy and then my sister Jean and Eunice and others and what we see here is a 7-year-old daughter who had suffered from a genetic disease called PKU and her younger sister… 

00:18:20
LYNNE SEAGLE There is a lot of misconceptions about people with disabilities. I mean, starting with the Kennedy’s. I mean, the Kennedy’s have been very… very big in the whole disability field right. But um, what… and what they claim to think primarily has been… has been the forming a special Olympics. Very big thing right, but still a very segregated thing, Very segregated and I struggle with those kinds of activities and I’ve spoken out against them. And then um, I’m sitting in my office and I get the secretary comes on the line and says, ‘Eunice Shriver is on the phone for you.’ And I was like I was in a dither(ph) you know, so I’m thinking she has heard me out, bashed in this Special Olympics. She (inaudible ) like ‘Hello.’ And she says um, you know that… that having new England accent that the Kennedys have so distinguishable that I had won the International Joseph P. Kennedy award for leadership and the past recipients had been people like Mother Teresa and B.F. Skinner. I can’t even, for some one that almost always has words available. I was speechless. So it became a big celebration for the whole agency. We rented a bus and we brought like 50 people, lot of people we served, people from the board you know, staff umm, went to the UN and received that award and it was a it really meant I think for… for the whole hope house community what it meant was that it had been really hard work close in all of these group homes. It’s hard to have principles. It’s costly to have principles. I mean, it’s easier to just talk about them then to really act on them and that was such a great acknowledgment because we did it. When we started thinking about closing down group homes it was a very modest request to people to have their own home. We closed our last group home down on March 1st and on the day that we were moving Michelle, Kelly and I (inaudible ) and we are looking at a women who was in their late 40’s and as she is walking into her home for the first time she turns around and she says, ‘I am so happy.’ And I wanted to tell you so am I because every single person with a disability that we serve right now lives in their own home and I say that’s a wonderful start for taking control of your own life and having the freedom that we all deserve.

00:20:50
When I moved into my own apartment and things got little better. I have more control of my life. (inaudible ) we can no longer do it I began to have more control of my life that’s when I decided to get married (inaudible ). I’ve been married… I got married um, February 14th 1990 I’m happy as today as that was than I got married. 

00:21:25
LYNNE SEAGLE I can remember um, a person we served Marilyn(ph) and um, she was… she was seen or she kind of had a crush on a guy, and that guy with surname(ph) Earl(ph) and um, they said over and over again they wanted to be together but we treated it because we were uneducated too at the time. It much way the society is we treated it is oh aren’t you (inaudible ) you know. I mean, we didn’t treat it very adult like until um, it was a Friday night and I can remember Terry(ph) the coordinator called me up and said Earl(ph) and Marilyn(ph) are missing. Um, my gosh! I mean and certainly they were both two people that missing didn’t wasn’t a good combination you know. Marilyn had certain medication she needed to take. Just health wise and they were gone. Um, over two days I mean, this is over night out… just out… any way the police did… did find them and when they brought them back I was of course you know, I was furious. I was just furious that they had had left you know, because I was so scared. Um, and I went over there and Terry met me at the door and she was you are not going to believe this. Earl(ph) took Marilyn because he said he was tired of not us believing that he loved Marilyn(ph). It was a one of those you know, Ah hah moments like oh I got it and so any way, they got married in the next year and um, she was a love of his life and vice versa. 

00:23:15

00:24:00
KATRINA CUNNUP When dad passed away I guess I would be the one to come over and tell then I came over and I was I was (inaudible ) tell her and started crying and Connie because she willed(ph) herself over to me a little bit close… 

00:24:15
CONNIE CUNNUP Ha..ha..ha.. 

00:24:15
….and said Katrina its gonna be okay. 

00:24:20
CONNIE CUNNUP Oh 

00:24:20
KATRINA CUNNUP Daddy doesn’t hurt any one. 

00:24:20
CONNIE CUNNUP No. 

00:24:20
KATRINA CUNNUP You told me not to cry. She gave me a big hug. 

00:24:25
TRUMAN CLOSE She calls me every Saturday between 8 and 8.30 and we talk, she reminds me that her mother and her father are dead, I said yeah. connie and I said you know, we know where were they are at don’t we? She says they are in heaven. I’ll say with the Lord. I said in (inaudible ) and that good to know. And that’s comforting and she says yeah. connie was sad a way bit at the same time she doesn’t dwell on it. 

00:24:45
KATRINA CUNNUP Every night she calls mom and she call me and she call Truman. 

00:24:55
Hmmm… 

00:24:55
KATRINA CUNNUP Same time every night that was… that was what she did before she went to bed. And when mom passed away there was nobody who loves except us, she has nobody to call there. 

00:25:00
Yeah. 

00:25:00
KATRINA CUNNUP So she was reduced to calling just me and it… it messed her up for a while. We are doing better. She will… will tell you when she meets somebody new she will tell mom and daddy died. 

00:25:20
TIMOTHY WRIGHT When Connie was 21, her mother Maxine did one of the most difficult things any parent has to do which often seems more difficult for parents with Down syndrome children. She put her into her own life away from home. That parting is inevitable, sooner or later. 

00:25:35
KATRINA CUNNUP I think it was a hard adjustment. 

00:25:35
CONNIE CUNNUP Hmmm.. Hmmm... 

00:25:35
KATRINA CUNNUP It was a very hard adjustment. (inaudible )? 

00:25:41
CONNIE CUNNUP Oh yeah… yeah… 

00:25:41
KATRINA CUNNUP Remember (inaudible )? 

00:25:43
CONNIE CUNNUP Oh yeah. 

00:25:43
KATRINA CUNNUP It was pretty far away. 

00:25:45
CONNIE CUNNUP Yeah. 

00:25:45
KATRINA CUNNUP And you didn’t like that. 

00:25:45
LYNNE SEAGLE So I’ve seen it both ways. I’ve seen parents struggling with making a decision to have their son or daughter moving to like a hope house and their kid doesn’t want to and its very painful experience. But I’ve also seen the converse of that when that decision wasn’t made because it was too painful and at the time the parents death, the child… the child having to adjust to strangers and agency and dealing with incredible grieve and that is definitely worse. 

00:26:20
KATRINA CUNNUP We had to go visit a lot. She didn’t… she didn’t like being that far away but and after two years um, she was pretty much enjoying being… 

00:26:25
CONNIE CUNNUP Yeah. 

00:26:25
KATRINA CUNNUP …out and about. 

00:26:30
CONNIE CUNNUP I love… 

00:26:30
KATRINA CUNNUP …being able to do what she wanted. 

00:26:30
CONNIE CUNNUP Yeah. 

00:26:30
KATRINA CUNNUP Alright. If you just going to keep saying yeah. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:55
LYNNE SEAGLE Having their own life directing your own life what every level you are interested in or have capacity to, I don’t think that that’s um, I think that’s a shared human need. Whether its church or whether its Sunday dinner with your at your families or going to your place of work and see, yes all of those things meant to a life what we call a life. A life is made up of… its not made up of a huge big mile stones or miracles or anything. It just made up of every day, every day very ordinary things.
