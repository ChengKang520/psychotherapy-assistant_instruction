ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN I've been given the privilege umm… and honor of introducing your speaker, who is me. So, thank you. And I think you'll enjoy this presentation, I hope. I know him very well, so just give you a little bit of background. Umm… This is the… write up they wrote on me, so. Arthur Becker-Weidman received his MSW from the University of Maryland at Baltimore, and his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland's Institute for Child Study. He achieved diplomat status in child psychology and forensic psychology from the American Board of Psychological Specialties. He is a registered clinician of ATTACh. Dr. Becker-Weidman has been treating the families of adoptive and foster children for over two decades. As director of the Center for Family Development, he consults with departments of Social Services, residential treatment centers, and mental health clinics throughout the U.S. and Canada. He provides training and workshops to parents and professionals across the U.S. and internationally. The results of an empirical study demonstrating the effectiveness of dyadic developmental psychotherapy, umm… were published in the April, 2000 issue of Child and Adolescent Social Work and he is the co-author of the book, Creating Capacity for Attachment. He has written several other publications in peer reviewed professional journals. He is on the board of directors of ATTACh and chairs the Clinical Registration Committee. Umm… And he is in Buffalo, New York, where he is also an adjunct clinical professor. So, we can all welcome Dr. Becker-Weidman, that's me. Thank you. Okay. We're starting a little late and I am… I apologize about that, I'll try to make up the time. What we'll be talking about today is the assessment of children with attachment disorders or on the construct I find more useful than RAD or attachment disorders is this construct of complex posttraumatic stress disorder, okay. So, we'll go through that. What I want to do is first give you some background. But, let me ask it this way first, how many of you are not relatively familiar with complex posttraumatic stress disorder as a clinical formulation? How many you are not real familiar with it? So, not too, so only a few of you. So… So, either I could ignore you and jump ahead, but that wouldn't be nice. So, I'm just gonna do a quick run through, okay. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Never ignore the mom. 

00:02:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Never ignore the mom. That's true. But there are some moms who are familiar. So, I'm gonna… anyway. So, yeah, I'll… I'll do a quick introduction of that. Umm… Then I want to talk briefly, very briefly, about the effects of early maltreatment on child development and domains of impairment. All that is the prelude to what… describing what goes into a thorough assessment, the process I'm gonna be describing is the one that I've developed over the years for assessing children. And it's a comprehensive assessment that is usable in a general office setting or practice, okay. So, I'll try to go through this first part quickly, because as I say we're… we're, umm… you know, about 10, 15 minutes behind schedule. Umm… So, what is CPTSD? Umm… Okay. There is some very good White Papers on it, van der Kolk, who everybody… Did everybody here see him when he just came? Yeah, he did a really nice presentation and he was a prime contributor to that document, a White Paper. But, if I were to sum up… oh, by the way, umm… if you get this CD from the people recording, the PowerPoint would be on it. So, you don't have to take a lot of notes. Or if you don't want to do that, if you would just give me your card when we're done, I can email you the PowerPoint presentation. So, you don't have to copy every single word down, okay. If you do email, excuse me, if you do email me, umm… because I get a lot of spam and my filter's set high, really high, if I don't email you back, thanks, got it, within in a day or two, it means my spam filter ate it, so you better call me, tell me your emailing me something I'll look for it, okay. So, if I were to boil down what is CPTSD in a nutshell, it is early chronic maltreatment that occurs within a care-giving relationship. What distinguishes it from PTSD, which I'm sure you're all familiar with, are several dimensions. This one in particular, chronic trauma, not an acute episode. Maltreatment in the care-giving relationship, this is… these are the defining elements in early, meaning occur, you know, occurring within the first three, four years of life. The reason this concept was developed for those of you who are not aware, again this is a clinical concept, this is not a psychiatric diagnosis at this point in time. It may in the DSM-5, with the schedule to come out in I think 2012, maybe included. But, the diagnosis of PTSD really was developed to apply to war veterans, and so doesn't apply to a lot of our kids, especially when you think or recognize that one of the important criteria in PTSD is the person has to have… has to have experience a life threatening event. So, five years in an orphanage doesn't qualify, but we all know those kids are traumatized. A history of four years in a neglectful home doesn't qualify, but we know those children are traumatized. So, the CPTSD, I find, is a very useful construct. I already talked about that. I used the term maltreatment, that's a catch-all term, I use shorthand for saying physically abused, sexually abused, neglected, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So, I use that term. I'm gonna skip through this. But this you should be familiar with, about… about 2% percent of population is adopted, you know, children adopted in early age, fair pretty well. Many, many of the children from the former Republics of the Soviet Union have significant problems, in part, because of the high rate of alcohol use there. I read a statistic somewhere on the amount of… average alcohol consumption, when you work those numbers through, you wind up with, on average, the average person in the Soviet Union drinks three shot of 100 proof vodka per day. That's a lot, or for me it would be a lot, I don't know about for you, but for me it would be a lot. So, umm… The other thing you're very familiar with, so I'm not gonna to spend a lot of time talking about it, often the issues that our children have are misdiagnosed. Why? For those of you familiar with the DSM-4, what is it? It's a laundry list of behaviors, right. So, when I say to you my child can't pay attention, is easily distractible, he has trouble sitting still, can't pay attention, sometimes gets hyper-focused on a video game, you're gonna say to me, "Oh, your child must have…" What? 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Behavior… 

00:07:35
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, and I'd say, could be but you're wrong, my child has sensory integration disorders, okay, because you see the same set of behaviors caused by ADHD, sensory integration or a head injury. So, if you only come away with one thing out of my presentation today, the one thing I would like to come away with is that we have to assess causes. What is causing the behavior? That's critical, not symptoms. Symptoms don't tell you much, except that something is awry. As you know many children in the child welfare system have problems. These are some statistics on that. Many children also have a variety of other mental health conditions, mood disorders, etcetera. Okay. The current term today is ARND. Are you all familiar with that? Anyone else… Alcohol Related Neurological Dysfunction. So, that's really the… the current term, and as you know there is no safe level. Many of our children have been exposed to alcohol, drugs, okay. Sensory integration disorders, neurological involvement, these are all areas because these are common issues that need to be assessed for. You don't need to be an occupational therapist to screen for this and then decide if you need to make a referral. And that's one of the important dimensions of an adequate assessment, would be you screen for a variety of conditions so you know what you need to refer out for. But you need to look at all of the issues that might be affecting this child, okay. Very important. Uh… Temperament is another issue. This could be thinking about, umm… because this is, sort of, biologically driven. Temperaments tend not to change, so you do want to consider that when you're looking at behaviors, and when you're looking at the match or mismatch between a parent and child, because some, you know, you can have temperamental patterns that mesh very well and others, they don't. So, for just example, my son is… I going to pick on him but, you know, he is my son so who else am I gonna pick up. Umm… He umm… He has a relatively short attention span and at the same time, he is very persistent. So, what that means is when he was, like, in junior high and he would ask me to help him with his math homework and me on the other hand, I also have a relatively short attention span and I am persistent. But I have a lot more OCD, sort of, traits than he does. So, I'd like to, you know, I start something and then I finish it and I do the next thing. David, his approach to homework was he'd do a little French, a little, you know, social studies, a little math. He finished everything, but in this sort of round-robin way, so when he'd ask me to help him with his homework, you know, "Dad I need help with math." I'd sit down with him, he'd do two problems and then he was done, and I'd start getting annoyed with him, because we should finish his math homework. He is not doing it right. And it was only when I realized, no, I mean, he just has a different temperament. It's not right or wrong, we just do things differently that doing homework together became not as much of a challenge for me, it wasn't for him. Uh… Most children are exposed to multiple traumas, only about 20% of children who have trauma have a discreet trauma. So, again CPTSD is the better clinical formulation, okay. What we're doing here, yeah, I want to… I do want to, sort of, skip ahead as quickly as I can. Umm… Sequelae of trauma, affect dysregulation, okay, you know that. If you're a parent, you live with that, right, affect dysregulation. Important to realize affect regulation is a global function. So, the child who gets angry very easily or… or has a tantrum very easily, we don't always think about this, there are also the child who, a parent may say… in fact, you know, if you say to them, "Do you play with your child, do you tickle them?" Or, you know, do the kinds of things we all do with kids, you'll often hear no, because once I start, she can't stop, right. It's the same affect dysregulation. Attention and concentration, not ADD, but attention and concentration caused by something different, in this case, early relational trauma. Negative self-image, impulse control, aggression, very high percentages, okay, very high percentages. Umm… In the research literature, as you know there are different categories of attachment, secure, then two kinds of insecure. You've got, umm… ambivalent and avoidant and disorganized. The disorganized type is the one most likely, but not… it's not a one-to-one correspondence, but it is the kind… the type more likely to go on to develop significant problems. Umm… So, I'm just gonna talk a little bit about… about that. umm… This form of attachment is called disorganized because no one pattern is consistently used, typically, this is from research by Mary Main and Erik Hesse. Typically is developed, if you will, when the caregiver is frightened, frightening or disorienting, or disoriented in relation to the child. Because, just to think about it, I'm gonna give you a quick overview to think about it. The attachment system gets activated when the child is feeling some threat, and attachment behavior is proximity seeking behavior. So, the child feels some threat, goes… wants to be closer to the caregiver, and then will relax and then when they feel okay again, the attachment system gets turned off and the kid goes about doing their business. So, what happens if the source of threat is your source of security? It's like driving your car with your foot on the break and the gas, you want to get closer to that person, but the other person is frightening, so you want to get away from them. And so essentially, the behavioral systems breakdown, okay. Okay, let me, umm… uh… then what happens is when children are living in that kind of environment, the state, the state of fear becomes a trait, an enduring quality of the individual. They don't calm down, their normal state is high alert, high stress. Often if you take the pulse of these children, their resting pulse is fairly elevated, because they're always on high alert, okay. How many of you have read Bruce Perry's new book? The Boy Who Was Raised… yeah, okay, for those of you who haven't, it's a very good book. He describes this in great detail, and it's a… it's essentially a case book. So, it's… it's a good reading or easy reading. Okay, umm… I don't think I wanted to… everybody is fairly familiar with… who isn't… who is not familiar at this point with these brain systems, and what they do and why they're important? Things like amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, who isn't familiar with them, who needs sort of a quick refresher, anybody? Nobody, okay, then I'm just gonna run through this and skip this, just again, so we can save time and stay on track and get to the things you're not familiar with. Essentially, the amygdala is the part of the brain that controls fight, flight, freeze. And impulses from your eyes and ears go there first before they get to the orbitofrontal cortex. And… And van der Kolk, sort of, covered this briefly in his presentation. So, we react before we can think. And what happens… what is supposed to happen is as the child develops, at the end… toward the end of the first year, into the middle of the second year, the connections between your… sort of, orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala develop, so that then you're able to think, right. Somebody cuts you off on the highway and when that happens, anyone… anyone here get annoyed when that happens, anybody? Yeah, you get annoyed. I won't ask how many of you follow them down the road, flash your lights, rum them off the road and then beat them to a pulp, but there are people who do that, right. And what do we call that? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Road rage. 

00:16:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Road rage, exactly. What happens to those people is their ability to think is disengaged. They're acting on fight, flight, freeze. We feel as angry as they do. It's just that we're able to say things to ourselves like, "Oh, I have to get to work." "Oh, I'm in Boston, what do I expect?" You know, whatever, but we don't react, we think and we choose a course of action that is to our advantage. The neocortex stays engaged. Children who've experienced relational trauma, those pathways do not develop to the extent they should. And so it's easier for them to become dysregulate. We all can become dysregulated, but the amount of emotional content it takes for them to become dysregulated is much less, hopefully… not hopefully, but it's much less than it is for the rest of us. Okay. So, I covered… Basically I gave you an overview of… of all of these slides. Now CPTSD, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, why do I like that? Umm… You know, besides the fact it rolls right off the tongue and it's easy to say. Several reasons, it captures the full range of impairment that our children have. You know, often we think of our kids as, "Oh, they might have attachment problems. Oh, but they also have sensory integration problems. Oh, and you know what, behaviorally they have problems." CPDSD is a clinical formulation that really integrates that. In the domains of impairment or attachment which you're most familiar with, biology, emotional regulation, dissociation, that's a response to threat, behavioral regulation, cognition and self-concept, okay. Those are the domains of impairment. So, a… a good assessment of children who've experienced chronic early maltreatment in a care-giving relationship has to consider each of those domains and the degree of impairment. Uh… Yes? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible )? 

00:19:06
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The question was, what about developmental trauma disorder, which van der Kolk talked about, and complex posttraumatic stress disorder. I think he… My understanding and I may be wrong, but my understanding is that's just a term he… he is using because he likes to use it. But I… I haven't read anything that leads to me believe that they're different. They may be, but I just haven't seen anything. And again, he was… he is one of the… the… the lead authors on the White Paper on a CPTSD. So my sense is, they're very similar. Okay, what I'm gonna do is go through each of these and talk a little bit about… hey, we're just about on target now. Good. I'm gonna talk a little about each of these, so you get a sense of what's involved, and then we'll talk in more detail about umm… about the, umm… assessment part of this. You know, I didn't write on my outline, when are we suppose to take a break. When… When is that? Nobody? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:20:11
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN What? 

00:20:11
JACKIE Drinks? 

00:20:11
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Not now, Jackie. It's too early to get a drink, Jackie. What… What time? 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Three-fifteen. 

00:20:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Three-fifteen, okay, I just want to make sure you get your entitled break, otherwise your union steward will complain to me. Okay, problems and attachment, right. We're all familiar with that. These are the areas, problems with relational boundaries, lack of trust, right. These are all fairly obvious, right. So, I'm not gonna spend a lot of time talking about them, 'cause these are things we're most familiar with. Biology, okay, here are things to think about. Sensory-motor developmental functioning, fine and gross-motor coordination, okay. Numbing, okay, sensory-integration dysfunction, physical symptoms, headaches, backaches, you know, throwing up, diarrhea, those kinds of things, and significant increase… medical problems. How many of you are not familiar with the CDC's ACE's study that van der Kolk mentioned in his talk, how many you are not familiar with that? Oh, I then able to talk a little bit about that in… in… in a little bit, in a couple of minutes then. So, the biological impacts of chronic early trauma that you need to be thinking about, sleep problems, eating problems, you need to be considering this . Emotional regulation, again this one you're fairly familiar with if you live with or work with these children, difficulty with emotional regulations, difficulty expressing emotions, right. What… Typically you ask your 9-year-old, you know, they… they're punching their sister and you say… you get them… some say, "What are you feeling?" And what do they say? 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:22:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN "I don't know." And it's true. I think we have to accept that that's true. They very often they don't know. The… The girl I'm gonna show you later, uh… in the assessment, a girl who is in umm… a Romanian orphanage for 10 years before she was adopted at age, uh… 10 and a half or 11. When I first began working with her, the best she could do was she either felt good or itchy, because when she got uncomfortable right before she hit someone, she would start going like this, okay. And that's the best she could do. And you'll hear her talk about that, that she doesn't know when she is getting angry, okay. So, difficulty identifying emotions, because how do you learn about emotions? You learn about them in relationship with a reasonably, a… a caring parent who picks you up and says, "Oh, my baby, you are unhappy", right. Didn't… Didn't we do that with our kids? You tell them what they're feeling and then they learn, okay. Umm… Difficulty identifying internal states, Peter Fonagy describes this as the reflective function, or in this case, the lack of reflective function, the ability to have a mental representation of the other person, yourself in the relationship. That's very important if you're gonna be relating to people, a reflective function and the ability to develop a mental representation of the other person, so you can anticipate how they might react or what they might think. It's also known in literature as the… as the theory of mind, okay. In an extreme form, you see this. For example, if I were to pick up a container of Altoids, okay, and I showed it to you and said, "What's in this?" What would you say? Yeah, breath mints, Altoids, right, not a problem. And now if I dumped it out and I put in paper clips, and I went outside there and said to someone, what would they say is in here, what would you say? Yeah, they'd say, right. So, a… a child with the… with autism would say paper clips, because they don't have the ability to recognize that here she knows something that out there they don't know, no theory of mind, okay. So, that's… that's really in an extreme form. Dissociation often in response to threat, that's the freeze dimension. The other component to that is that when the trauma is that overwhelming, splitting off or dissociating the episodic memory from the implicit emotional memory is one way to mange that, so it is not so overwhelming and disturbing, okay. Behavioral regulation, Mike, you know this. These children have difficulty regulating impulses. They often engage in self-destructive behavior, risk-taking behavior, aggression and, you know, pathological self-soothing. We see this in orphanage children, the rocking, sometimes, even self-injurious behavior that winds up being self-soothing. And you talk to people who… who cut themselves, they talk about afterwards, they cut themselves because they feel better, okay. Anyone here watch House? Yeah, I love that show, except I wish… I wish they would get off drugs already. I mean, it's a little bit much… he is such a good physician and he is a… he is a drug addict, you know. But there is… there is one episode where he was trying to get off the medication he is on, and what he does at one point is cut himself, because the endorphin that gets released after that… what he said, were how… I… again, I wish they hadn't shown that. But, that's an example of that. Okay. Disturbances of eating, substance abuse, excessive compliance, right, not genuine compliance, compliance out of fear, so much compliance that again you… often, I see this in its most extreme form among orphanage children who are so attuned to everybody else and what they need and want, and… and… and trying to meet that need, that they really loose themselves. They have no sense of their inner life because they're so externally focused, which made sense in the orphanage, because if you have scarce resources, what's the best way to get what little there is, it's to be cute and endearing, and be able to, kind of, read people and… and respond. So, we see all these things. Cognition, learning problems, okay. Many of the children we work with have significant problems in school. Many of these children, there is a big gap between what we believe, even though the tests don't show it, what we believe their ability is compared to their achievement level. I can't tell you how many parents will say, "You know, I know she only has an IQ of 80, but I know she is smarter than that", right. And that… any of the parents here is that the case? Yeah, yeah. Because if you're so caught up with the trauma, you don't have much mental energy leftover for learning. You need a secure base to learn, you need a sense of safety to learn, right. I mean, we know that, right. If you're… if your boss has just said to you, "You know, we're gonna have some layoffs and… and your work's okay, not great." And then, your supervisor says, "Oh…" Either way, there is a whole new procedure and… and begins to explain it to you. How likely are you to remember that? Not likely. On the other hand, if your supervisor comes in and says, "Hey, you're getting a bonus this year because you're… you're my A plus worker, you're the best." And they now explain this new procedure to you, you're probably gonna remember it and, okay, so you get… you get the idea. So, these children have difficulty with cognition, they have difficulty learning, umm… trouble with attention. And you… you… you need to pay attention to learn, right. Yes, you should all be nodding your heads. You're not paying attention if you're not nodding your head, okay. Difficulty with executive functions, these are higher cortical brain functions. Right, planning, judgment, the ability to start something, use of material, self-monitoring, okay, difficulty processing new information, all of these things will be impaired. Anticipating, language lags. This I find interesting, umm… I use the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales whenever I do an assessment. I'll talk a little bit about this when I talk about tests, but I use that to assess a child's developmental age in certain key areas. How many of you are not familiar with the Vineland? Okay, so all right, I just don't want to, like, say stuff you already know. So, I use this to assess a child's developmental age in certain key areas. And one of the areas is communications, and I find very, very frequently that for these children, there is a significant gap between receptive and expressive communication abilities. And the gap that I see is that their expressive communication abilities are higher than their receptive. And think about that for a minute. When we talk to people, we speak to them the way they speak to us. So, if I'm using big words and big sentences, you're gonna speak to me the same way. If I'm using, you know, one syllable words and short sentences, you're going to change how you speak to me. So, if the child is able to express themselves up here, but understands over here, they're… not always, but there may actually be times when the child seems defiant or oppositional, and they really just don't understand what they have been told or asked to do, because their expressive is higher than their receptive. That's very important again. So, you can see why looking at some of these issues becomes very important in how you treat these. And for parents, I can… I can tell you when… when they see that and understand that with their child, their feelings around that issue often change dramatically, right. How many of you like and enjoy defiant oppositional people? No, nobody does. But… But… But somebody who has trouble understanding, I at least, I assume you do, have some empathy for, some sympathy for, and we'll make an effort to… to help them with that. Yeah, there is a question here. The question was, is there consistency in the degree of gap and the answer is no, it varies. For some children there is none, for some it is several years, for some it's closer. So, it… it does, it just kind of varies. Yes? 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN How do you assess children whose first language is not English? 

00:31:55
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Good question. How do I assess children whose first language is not English? Umm… Again, the parents are filling up the Vineland or I'm doing it in an interview, so we… but I would take that into account. So, say it's a 10-year-old who just came over from Russia or Guatemala, you know, China or where ever, you'd have to take into account that of course, their language abilities would be lower, but what I'm want to look at here is, is there a gap between expressive and receptive. What I find more often when children, you know, if they come over from… from another country with the different language, but there is nothing else really going on, those are pretty even, okay. I worked with some children from Liberia, and although they speak English in Liberia, it's a different kind of English, okay. And… And… And they score lower, but there is not as much of a gap, okay. Okay. Umm… Okay. Self-concept, their sense of self is fragmented, disconnected, their autobiographical narratives are very disjointed, poorly developed sense of separateness. So, all of these issues, low self-esteem, they've been treated as if they're not valuable and not valued. And because that's occurred in a chronic way, that becomes part of their self-image. And again, if you think about this in terms of relationships, don't you expect to be treated in a certain way, right. And if someone treats you badly, you get indignant, right. Now, we don't have a word for… What happens when someone goes overboard with the compliments? We don't have a word for that funny feeling. But… But you know that funny feeling if someone just goes overboard, you're wonderful, you're the best, you know, you're terrific, and you're thinking, "I didn't do anything that special". You want them to, like, stop already. Well, if you have a reasonably good self-concept, that doesn't happen that often. If you feel intrinsically unlovable, that you're really just a throw away kid, that you're, just, you know, really a piece of garbage or trash, you're gonna get that feeling a lot, about a lot of things. And try to get the person to treat you the way you feel about yourself, right. I mean, it seems pretty obvious at that point, okay. Because of how they feel about themselves, so they do things, not consciously, but… just like us, we all do things to get people to treat us the way we want. And… And… And that's… that's the critical element here, it's the excessive shame, it's the overwhelming and excessive shame that drives a lot of this. They've been treated as if… not that they do things that aren't good, but they have been treated as if they are intrinsically bad. And that becomes how they see themselves, okay. Other effects, umm… Let's see, I've covered… I've covered most of this. Again, many of the children I see, I probably… I think I could… I think I could safely say all of the children that I evaluate and see have an overall adaptive level of functioning multiple, several years behind their chorological age. And that's very important, because we treat people where they are developed mentally, not chronologically, right. We… When we treat people well or appropriately, we treat them where they are developed mentally, not chronologically. Now at the extreme end, we know that, right. You wouldn't treat a 22-year-old, who has an IQ of 40 like your 22-year-old son or daughter, would you? Would you? No, of course not, because at that level IQ developmentally, they are much younger than those chorological years, to a much lesser degree, but still a degree, we see that with children who've experienced chronic early maltreatment. So, we want to treat them where they're developed mentally, not chronologically. And often that's why children have difficulty, and often if things improve at home, I'm getting to treatment, and… and I'm really not here to talk about that, but when parents begin to treat their child where they are developmentally, not chronologically, often some of the difficulties at home begin to disappear. The parent feels better because the child, in fact, is able to meet those expectations. Uh… Changes in parent-child relationship after trauma. Again, we see all of these… One important thing if you're working with… How many of you have worked with birth(ph) families? Yeah, so when we're doing reunification work or helping them, this is a very important dynamic. They wind up being traumatic reminders for each other, which makes the work a little more difficult, because they're not in a safe environment, right. The number one, the first thing in terms of good trauma treatment, number one is what, safety. Yes, thank you for it. Number one is safety. So, if you're living with somebody who is a constant reminder of that, you… you've not created a psychologically safe environment, so it's… it's more difficult. Okay. Domestic violence. I want to go on to talk about the umm… the ACE's study, adverse childhood experiences. Umm… As Dr. oh, I'm sorry, yes, you have a question? 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:37:46
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Well, what I would… The question was, you know, as a foster parent she has to take her little girl to visit her abusive father regularly, so she is constantly re-traumatizing her, in addition, umm… I don't want to make you feel bad, but, I mean, in addition, the other piece that makes your work with her more difficult is you want to be able to say to your child, "You're safe here, I'm gonna keep you protected," and you're not doing that. Yeah. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN As the (inaudible ) father that was not protected (inaudible ). 

00:38:17
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN This really… And so the question is what can you do, and your answer to that one, well the courts know. That's really where a therapist who is really knowledgeable in this area can be extremely helpful, because I write a lot of reports, letters to the court saying, "While this child is in treatment for a temporary period of time, I don't want visits, because they're not therapeutic. In fact, they're damaging to the child. Here is why." Explain, and I would say most of the time, at least where I am… the judges will read that and allow the temporary suspension of umm… of visits, until in my opinion the child is able to tolerate that. So, what I would say is you need to really good advocate as a parent. I don't think there is much you can do, but if you can get a good independent advocate, umm… that can be very, very helpful. There's a question back there. Comment, what it's meant depends what state you're in its… In Connecticut, it's mandated by law. Again, what I would say is if you can get a credible relationship with your… everything is about personal relationships, raising kids, having friends. It's all about personal relationships, and if you can get a good relationship with the judge so that you're credible, then you can have a reasonably good impact. Umm… So, oh, two… two more… two more questions (inaudible ), yeah. 

00:39:37
UNKNOWN The foster care (inaudible ) 

00:39:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Right, that's why I said you need to… you need a good advocate, whether it's an attorney or a therapist, someone like that. Let me take your question, I haven't heard from you before. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN How much that… How much that I might early you have to wait (inaudible ), that is somebody who has a consistent relation with the courts. 

00:40:00
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN The… The comment was in her area, she's having very good success with the "guardian en litem", who has a consistent relationship with the courts, umm… so, yeah. I think there're… there're ways to do that, it's… it… you… I see have a burning comment. So, go ahead and then… and then let's move on. Go ahead. 

00:40:20
(inaudible) 

00:40:25
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah, yeah, okay. But, again… again my experience is I've been able to work with the courts umm… to get them to suspend the visits, because it's not in the child's best interests and they're damaging the child psychologically and emotionally. And you have to use strong language, you can't just say, "Oh, I think it's a good idea", but you have to use strong language. It's damaging, it will cause permanent damage, blah, blah, blah. And anyway, so let's… let's move on. So, adverse childhood experiences, the CDC did this wonderful study looking at several thousand medical records and… of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, and they identified, well, what they… they had a list of things they called "adverse childhood experiences". If you have any of these, you have an ACE in your background. And some of these are obvious, that would… that would be an adverse childhood experience. But somebody is having and of course, where the family member, one parent, being in a single parent home is an adverse childhood experience, okay, neglect, mother being abused, is an ACE, okay. Som these are ACE's, but bad ACE's, not the good ACE's. And the model they use, which is a very, I think, well thought out one, is that adverse childhood experiences lead to disruptive neurodevelopment. And that's really what Dr. van der Kolk talked about in his address, which leads to social, emotional and cognitive impairments, right, and that's what we all live with, which leads then to the adoption of health risk behaviors, which then leads to disease, disability and social problems, and finally to early death, okay. And umm… what they found, van der Kolk, I think he showed this slide, I can't remember, but in their population of everybody at Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, not representative of the United States population obviously, 'cause Southern California is probably more affluent than most parts of the country, and everybody had health insurance, right. What they found was… how many, what percent of people had ACE's. Almost a quarter of them reported alcohol abuse in their family, you know, background, 20% mental illness. But look down here, a third, physical abuse, a fifth, sexual abuse. So, adverse childhood experiences as was said in the keynote, are not these events that happen to a few people over there. They happen to a large percentage of us here today. Umm… Here what they did was they… statistically they were able to figure out and tease out what they call the "population attributable risk". In other words, when you get rid of everything else, what's the risk of developing one of these? If you have one or more ACE's in your background, so when you control… look at this, when you control for everything, the risk of your attempting suicide, if you have one or more ACE's in your background, is 60%. Look at that. This isn't a surprise. You would think if you have a bad childhood, you are more likely to be an alcoholic, that's not surprising, drug abuse. But this is. Somehow having adverse childhood experiences makes it more likely you'll be the victim of sexual assault and domestic violence. In fact, 62% of the risk of being a victim of sexual assault is associated with one or more ACE's in your background, after you control for everything else. That's remarkable, okay. Uh… Then, the other thing which I just found interesting, a couple of things, number of ACE's, the likelihood of you doing this, right, that 5% of the population smokes, I suppose, but the more ACE's in your background, the more likely you're to smoke. Probably not surprising if you think about it, right. Bad childhood, pick up bad habits. But this one, look at this one, COPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, if ever there was an illness that clearly was biological and biochemical and had nothing to do with psychology and emotions or any of that, you know, touchy-feely crap, right. Look at this, if you have no ACE's in your background, the odds of your getting COPD in this population was about 5%. If you had more than four ACE's, they jump up to about 17%, 18%. That's remarkable. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Does that correlate to (inaudible )? 

00:45:40
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN No, no, after… this is after they've control for everything else, smoking, obesity, age, all of that, just the risk associated with ACE's, okay. That's remarkable. So, if you… if you pull up this study, you can look at the CD website and get it. They have a lot of these kinds of graphs about a lot of things. So, it really does show you the public health issue, the child abuse and neglect represents and why it's so important that we not only do treatment, but also prevention, okay. IV drug use, not surprising, okay. Umm… Good. Again, some of this you should be familiar with. If you've been exposed to domestic violence, look how much more likely you are to be abused, okay, just being exposed to domestic violence. So, there there're some significant, uh… issues here about being exposed to trauma of one sort or another, double the rate of psychiatric problems, except… But all of these… you know all of this. You know this through… through your experience. It shouldn't… should not be a surprise to you. Impact of trauma on the caregiver, loss of felt security, the less security, the less felt security the caregiver has, the less they can create for their child, right. I mean, again, it seems obvious, but very important to think about. The changing view of self and how that impacts. I talked about the traumatic reminders, traumatic expectations. So, in terms of assessment, this is a repeat of the earlier slides, you need to be thinking about… as you're doing an assessment, attachment issues, biology, all of these areas you need to be thinking about in addressing, okay. Now, umm… okay. I think we're… we're doing good time wise. So, before I talk about now types of assessment, move into that, any questions about what I've covered as, sort of, the… the base so far. Yes ma'am. 

00:48:00
UNKNOWN How do you deal with a client, how long does it have to go on to be chronic as opposed to acute? 

00:48:05
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Ah, excellent question, the question is how long does it have to go on to be chronic as opposed to acute. Umm… longer than acute, for a bit of time, okay. So, umm… a discreet incident umm… would be just that one incident. So, by chronic, we're really looking at, I would say, you know, months. And the longer, the worse it is. So, to create one extreme, several months of very difficult experiences as an infant and then going into a wonderful home, obviously will be less damaging than, umm… several months of neglect and abuse and then going through four, five, fost… foster homes in a row, and then the two being placed and… okay, so you get… you get the idea. What it does is essentially the way to think about this is there's no magic cut-off. The way to think about this is… let's… umm… I can do it here. Well, I think it's Bowlby, I think, somebody does, has a really wonderful, umm… I uh… picture of development, or it might be Daniel Stern, but development is like a tree. And we'll just call the midline what is normal and healthy, and there're many paths that you can take along this, umm… development, okay. Early maltreatment can put you on a pathway that leads further and further away from healthy normal development. And then other… other experiences can bring you back closer or drive you further away. And so that's really the way to think about this, it's not that chronic early maltreatment and now the child is doomed, umm… it puts them on a… on a problematic developmental pathway. And depending on what happens, that pathway may continue to diverge from normal healthy development, or may move back toward it, and in fact, that's why they're in many of your homes, it's to help them move back toward healthy normal development, right, okay. Uh… Any other questions before we talk about, umm… move right into the assessment piece? Again, I wanted to provide you this background just so that you understand that… I like frameworks, I like to, sort of, understand the theory so I know what I'm doing, and mainly so that, umm… I can do it my way, you know, and… and sort of tinkle with it. So, I think if you understand the basic principles, then you can adapt it to your particular setting. So, there are many types of interviews. Clinical, structured, right, psychometric, I'm going to talk about instruments you can use, parent, instruments, child reports, right. Different kinds of areas you can look at. My basic approach to assessment, what I encourage you to do, is use several different approaches. So, clinical interviews are very helpful, psychometric instruments from the child, from the parent, from the school, helps you understand the child. But also, when you've got several different, umm… instruments for several different modalities pointing in the same direction, you can have more confidence in your assessment. And when they start pointing in different directions, then you need to explore that to figure out why that is. Okay. 

00:52:15
[sil.] 

00:52:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN So, my outline for a thorough assessment would be first, you should review old records. Umm… Especially with Social Service agencies, I used to charge for my time for reviewing work, 'cause I don't anymore. Because what I realized is when I was doing, that they would edit them very carefully, so I only got three or four pages, you know, so it's cheap. So, I don't… So, I just tell people, you know, "Send me all your records, I want to look at them," and… and for Social Services, now I get these, you know, huge, huge files which is great because I get a lot of good information, police reports, Protective Service reports, all kinds of rich data which is enormously helpful. So, review of old records. You're gonna get an overview now. I'll go through each of these in more detail, uh… maybe after the break. Umm… Then I have a session, one meeting, with the parents regarding the child. My basic model of assessments is the recessions, okay. First one is with the parents, you talk about the child, but at the same time, even though we're talking about the child, I'm evaluating the parents, 'cause I need to know given the kind of treatment that we do, are they going to be available and if there're problems or whatever we need to do in terms of helping the parents get to a point where they can be therapeutic with… with this… with this child. Use of various testing questionnaires, I'll talk about that in more detail when we get to that. Just in case I forget, all of the testing questionnaires that I'm gonna be describing, if you have a masters degree, you can use them and get access to them. The use of these tests is not controlled by your license, it's controlled by the test publisher. So, if you request some of these for the first time, you fill a lot of questionnaire and they'll determine whether you can get that test or not. So, for example, the Vineland, if you have a masters degree, you should be able to get it. If you requested the WAYS or the WISC, and didn't have a course in that, they wouldn't let you have it, but if you did have a course, say it's part of your MFT degree, you took a course and learned how to administer the WISC, if you show them that, verified it, you can get a copy of it. The only exception here is Canada, umm… because in Canada umm… social workers can treat, but they can't diagnose. So, I guess, you could use these tests, but you couldn't use them to make a diagnosis if you're a social worker in Canada, okay. So, the use of various tests and questionnaires. Then I'll meet with the child and I'll describe that and I'll show you several tapes of interviews with children, okay. And then after that I meet with the parents to go over the results of the assessment, talk about everything that's I picked up on, make referrals and then talk about treatment and treatment planning. So, three interviews. Now the exceptions of this is if I'm gonna to be involved in a court proceeding, termination of parental rights, custody, then what I do is a lot more involved. But, I'm talking about if a family comes to me, adoptive family, foster family, department of Social Services says, "We want to know what's going on with this child", this is the basic model that I use. You need to assess for a variety of other mental health conditions, because children can have a variety of mental health conditions. So you need to look for them. These are some of the more common ones you may find. You need to be screening for neuropsychological issues, okay. I don't do neurological testing. I'm assuming most of you here don't, maybe one or two of you are… are neuropsych… and board certified in that. Umm… But you need to screen for that so that you know should you or should you not make a referral to a board certified neurophysiologist for further assessment. Sensory integration, you need to screen for that. I would say two thirds of the children, maybe more, maybe 75% of the kids that I see have sensory integration dysfunction, and of that group, of that 75%, I would say a good half come with a diagnosis of ADHD because of the attention problems, but they don't actually have the medical condition ADHD. They do have attention problems. They don't have ADHD, okay. ARND, I discussed that earlier, Alcohol Related Neurological Dysfunction, you need to consider that. Umm… Let's see. Differential diagnosis. Umm… How many of you, well, I can go through this if you're interested. How many of you… How do I… I'm trying to think how I want to ask this. Umm… I'm gonna say how many of you would not be interested in this. I guess… do you… I can go through this if you're interested in this sort of differential diagnosis, or I could skip that if you want to talk more about… 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN I think this is very, very important. 

00:57:50
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN You do? Okay. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN There is not enough, uh… really presentations here on assessment and the diagnosis (inaudible ). 

00:58:01
BECKER-WEIDMAN Okay. Okay. All right, okay, I'll talk about it. You disagree with her? 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN No, I just want to reiterate more specifically, I think it will be really helpful differentiating bipolar disorder. Where do you do differentiate that from other things? And particularly in childhood, that will be very helpful. 

00:58:20
ARTHUR BECKER-WEIDMAN Yeah. So let me go through this then. Umm… As you probably won't be surprised, when I do differential diagnosis, I do not look at symptoms. What I look at, I think of in terms of domains, areas where there will be differences, and that's how I would make a differential diagnosis. So, for example, family history. Umm… For ADHD, there usually is a family history, right, the acorn doesn't fall far from the oak, right. You know, my friend, Marge, in Princeton, she is a psychologist. She has this annoying habit of pointing out that my son's ADD must come from me. And she always does what I've done stuff like left my coffee cup on top of the car, well, I'm looking for my glasses and they're up here, you know, stuff like that. So, there is that component. History of mood disorder, often with children or bipolar disorder, there is a history of mood disorder in the family, both genetically related. Reactive attachment disorder, what you're looking for is a history of abuse, mental illness, chemical dependency. It's really a psychological condition, not a… not related to, you know, genetics. Destructiveness is another dimension you can, kind of, begin to look at. Kids with ADD or ADHD, they will break things, but usually because they're careless, like, they knock stuff over, but it's by accident, umm… it's not aggressive. Children with bipolar disorder, uh… they will destroy things sometimes, but typically, it's in a temper tantrum, and whatever is handy they might destroy. It could be, you know, they pick up a glass and throw it, or a table, or it could be their best toy, right, but it's whatever handy. Children with reactive attachment disorder, if they are violent and disruptive and many… and… and a good portion are not. But, it's not unusual when they are for that destructiveness to be, or at least to appear to be, intentional in the sense that things get broken, but never their best toy. Okay, so it's just… again, I wouldn't make a diagnosis on that alone, but what I'm… what I would suggest you is, we're gonna a look at these different dimensions, and as things begin to add up, the more they add up and fall into line, the more confidence you can have. Temper tantrums, kids with ADD, they move lose their temper in frustration, but they're pretty short-lived. This is one of the hallmarks of bipolar disorder, is the temper tantrums tend to last for a long time and they're not controllable. In other words, if you say to the child, "Turn off the TV and go to bed," and they start having a tantrum, if you say to them, "Uh, never mind, put the TV back on, you can stay up," they're not likely, if they're in a real tantrum, to say, "Oh, okay, great, I'll sit here and…" Well, if they… Well if they can begin to calm themselves down, it takes time and they'll still be irritable and irritated for quite a while. Okay, it's very hard for them to, sort of, get out of that. Children with reactive attachment disorder, umm… sometimes those tantrums can be controlled, or if you were to say, "Fine, you can watch TV," the disregulation that you created when you said you couldn't, is now removed, and they reintegrate a bit and then they're not as unhappy. Regression, you rarely see regression in kids with ADD. Umm… You do see that in kids with bipolar disorder, disorganized thinking, tangential thinking, flight of ideas, okay, especially under stress and in an extreme form, of course, you can see psychotic behavior, delusions, hallucinations. Umm… With reactive attachment disorder, you're not likely to see that, but you're likely to see a more developmental delays, difficulties with cause and effect thinking, okay. Moods, kids with ADD tend not to be… they don't have, uh… you know, they don't' have general unhappiness, right. In fact, often they're happy go lucky, because like my son, he didn't… you know, he'd forget stuff so, you know, it's a kind of happy go lucky life. Me too, in fact, I was… my wife and I were somewhere and I was describing some period in our life and it was nice and it was wonderful. And she looked at me and said, "Are you out of your mind? That was a horrible time. Don't you remember there was this going on, and this and this and this?" And I said, "Oh, no, I don't remember that. Did that really happen?" You know, I forgot all about it. It's a nice way to live. Children with bipolar disorder, dysphoria, irritability, are chronic, they're chronically irritable. Umm… I… I think about this in terms of it's very difficult to satisfy them. These are often, not always, but often the children, you say, "Let's go get ice-cream." "Great, dad." You take them, you get them their favorite ice-cream cone, and now they don't want it. They want a hamburger instead, or the chocolate isn't chocolaty enough, or the vanilla isn't sweet enough. But somehow, nothing ever satisfies them, okay, because there is a chronic irritability or grandiosity, okay. Boy I was seeing, eight-years-old, so this really captures a kid, reactive attachment disorder and bipolar disorder, and he came in. This was like our 12th session, so we've been meeting for a couple of months. And he sits down on the couch next to me and says, "Well, Dr. Art, today is our last session." I said, "Really, Austin? That's wonderful. How come?" He said, "Well, I'm done, I don't have problems anymore." "That's so good, Austin, I'm happy for you. That's great. Uh… Remind me again, why was it you were coming here?" "Well, I… I used to hit my mom and punch her. And… And… And remember I'd be violent?" "Oh, yeah, that's right. And you used to break stuff and throw stuff at her." "Yeah, yeah." "You don't do that anymore?" "No." "Really? That's great, how come?" He said, "I just decided I'm not gonna do that anymore." "Good job, Austin. How long has it been since you hit your mother?" "Oh, I haven't hit her since breakfast." Okay. So that grandiosity, I've decided it so and therefore it is, okay, is present. Kids with reactive attachment disorder, their moods can appear superficial, their hyper-vigilance makes them suspicious and distant, but they don't have this… these elements to them, okay. Attention span, alright, ADD, it's either short or hyper-focused. Kids with bipolar disorder, just depends on their interest, that's not a major factor, although they can sometimes have attention problems, and children with histories of trauma, reactive attachment disorder. If they meet the criteria for that diagnosis, often can be hyper-aroused, hyper-vigilant, therefore easily distractible, alright, because so they're so hyper-vigilant. Impulsivity, right, secondary to inattention, here it's driven by grandiosity, thrill seeking. These are the kids who will climb on the garage roof and say, "I think these wings will let me fly." "No, be careful, you're gonna hurt yourself." "No, no, no, I'm not… I'm not gonna hurt myself." They believe it, they say it, so it must be true, right. And then they're surprised, "Yeah, how did that happen?" Poor cause-effect thinking, so they tend to impulsive. Self-esteem, not… not often a problem with ADD, but can be if… if they have a sense of poor performance, okay. Umm… Bipolar can be low, of course, by the unpredictability of their moods… or grandiose. "Do you have friends?" "Yes, everybody in the school loves me." "But do you have a best friend?" "Yes, you know, uh… I have a bunch of best friends." "Who?" "Well, all the people who sit at my table." "Do you know their names?" "No, I don't know their names, but they're all my best friend." Okay, so that kind of thing. And here of course, often low self-esteem caused by the early maltreatment. Lying. All kids lie, kids with ADD may lie, although I do find it's a kind… one of the… one of the benefits of having a child with ADD is often they don't lie well, because of the short attention span. I remember, once my son came home, he was in… he was in middle school. And he comes home. "How was your day, David?" "Oh, I got in trouble on the bus." "Uh, what happened?" "Oh, no, no, never mind, Dad, never mind." "Well, no, no, come on, David, tell me what happened." And so typical ADD, he says, "Well, I got on the bus and I thought the bus driver said something to me. So I turned around, and I called her an asshole. And you know, Dad, the moment it came out of my mouth, I knew I shouldn't have said it." Right, typical right ADD kind of behavior, that… that impulsiveness. Umm… Kids with bipolar disorder, sometimes they'll make up stories to get away with it. They enjoy in some way, if they got this grandiose piece going, proving that they are smarter than you are, okay. And children with reactive attachment disorder, because of the early trauma, often lack object constancy, often lack cause and effect thinking, it's sometimes called crazy lying, because they're so big. But it's really a lack of object constancy, and a lack of cause and effect, and driven, I believe, ultimately driven by shame. Toddlers hide their face when they're feeling shame, because they don't want you to see them. Bigger children can make up a story when they feel shame, and they can hide that way. Motivation, good starters, poor finishers, grandiosity is the key element here. Children with attachment disorder lack the initiative. They feel ineffective. They haven't had a lot of experiences with the competency and with making things happen, right. When they cry, someone didn't come, so they didn't learn that they could influence their environment. So, they don't try. And drug abuse, umm… maybe present here, often not here, okay. Umm… Let me just quickly run through this. Well, let's do this, umm… 'cause we're at about 3:20 or so, 3:15. Let's take our break, 10, 15 minutes, come on back and then I'll finish this up and we'll… we'll move along.
