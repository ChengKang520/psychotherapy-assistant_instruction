REBECCA E. MICHEL I'm doctor Becky Michel and I'm a faculty member at Governors State University. And today I will be sharing my perspective about aging with Grace, supporting successful aging among older adults. I want you to think about what you are doing this past Valentine's Day. So, I know that might be a source subject for some people, but this past Valentine's Day there was a documentary that was sweeping the nation. It's called the Age of Love and it was about among all things, speed dating. So, the concept of speed dating is that single individuals who are looking for love, get together and they meet each other in a very condensed timeframe. The interesting part about this documentary is that it was all with older adults. These are older adults many of whom had lost significant others, some of whom were bachelors their whole lives. And what this documentary really exemplified was that people are striving for human connection at all ages of their life, not only in high school and not only in middle age, but also in older adulthood, people are wanting to connect with others in a meaningful way. I suggest for you next Valentine's Day to check that one out. So, successful aging is the study of the positive aspects of aging, this has only been studied for the past couple of decades and it's been named things such as aging well or healthy aging or positive aging. And essentially the foundation of that of positive aging is that individual strengths are identified and capitalized in order to emphasize the coping skills that are needed to be able to manage life at the end stage, because we know that while some study suggests that people are the most satisfied at the end of their lives, we also know that there is lot of challenges that come usually with later life. So, we have partners and spouses who are passing away. We have a loss in roles right, sometimes may be somebody who's been a breadwinner. And has raised their children their whole lives, their children launch and they no longer have that role as a caregiver and the breadwinner again who has worked their whole lives earning income for the family, they retire. So, they… they move from earning income to being in retirement. And they don't know how to manage that new change in life role. And so, successful aging has adopted strategies to figure out what characteristics do older adults have that help them successfully manage these transitions throughout their lives. There has been a few different studies that have studied successful aging, one is the MacArthur study of successful aging. And this ran from 1988 to 1996. And John Rowe and several of his colleagues worked at over a 1100 healthy adults between the ages of 70 and 79. And they found that there are several different really unique contributions that help set them apart from people who are not aging well. So, some components of successful, aging you might be thinking, okay, I'm ready, right. I am… I want to be one of these people who is aging successfully. So, some components are that they are avoiding disease, they're engaging with life and they are maintaining physical and cognitive functioning. So, you might think, okay avoiding disease, engaging with life, physical and cognitive functioning one of those is really in my control. And then some could argue aspects of each of those, right, are in your control. You can't do away with a heredity right, some of us are going to be more prone to develop certain diseases, but we can take steps to take a more active or healthy lifestyle. And that's where a councilor can come in, to help us engage in a positive way with life. And so we're going to focus on that area; engagement, life engagement, because that's where we find with older adults that counselors can make the most impact, where can they engage in their life. So, there was another study that was done, that you may of heard of, at Harvard, it was in the 1930s. And this study looked at individuals who, for several years, it was a longitudinal study, who were identified by deans at Harvard, these were individuals who were pretty well connected, they have a lot of support, right, and these individuals, they were 80% of them who lived past their 80th birthday. And not only were these people living past their 80th birthday, but they were living well for the most part, past their 80th birthday. And some of the predictors that separated these individuals from others in society who aren't living so well. Again, this is kind of a checklist for yourself. Ready? All right, so they were not smoking or abusing alcohol. They had adoptive coping. So, they knew themselves and they knew how to cope with the life transitions. So, for example, they practiced alterism(ph), they practiced humor, they were able to find the good in situations that weren't always that good. A few other things is that they were healthy weight, they had a stable partnership or marriage, they engaged in some exercise and they also were cognitively engaged, they were seeking some education, even if they didn't have to. So, these were some qualities of these individuals. The one limitation to this study is that, it was all Caucasian individuals. So, these type… this type of research needs to be replicated in many different cultures to see are these you know, are these the ingredients for successful aging among lots of different cultures? So, of speaking of different cultures, one culture that's been studied by lots of different researchers has been nuns, because nuns are a separate group, they are pretty confined, they don't have a lot of outside stressors, outside of what they are experiencing. And they can be studied over a long period of time. And so, Dana and colleague studied the autobiographies of nuns. And what they found was that the nuns who wrote more positive aspects and reflections throughout their journaling, they actually were more content after their 80th birthday, than people who focused on all the negative thing. This is what the priest did today and this is what the parishioners did, you know, rather than you know I was able to give back to my community in this way. And it felt so rewarding for me to help out this… this individual experiencing homelessness, you know or what not. So, they actually were able to find a categorical difference between people who practice and intentionally used language that was positive compared to people who mostly focused on negative aspects of their life. So, again, and you've heard this before, but a lot of times it's more of your mindset that impacts your happiness and your wellbeing rather than the circumstances. It's more how you approach the situation. And again to stress, this… this varies by culture and more needs to be done to study this… this arena says successful aging in other cultures. So, I brought up a documentary at the beginning of this talk and I wanted to mention in the other documentary, I love movies, I think that they really capture the heart of what's happening sometimes in a society. And back in 2007, there was a documentary called, Young At Heart. I'm not sure if any of you heard of it, but again it swept the nation, because it was a rock and roll documentary. And this was the documentary about older adult choir singers who got together to jam out, to the oldies to jam out, to current music and you should see this documentary, people, not only the older adults but peep… the audience members who are witnessing these concerts by this group of people who are aging successfully, they are inspired, they are moved, people are moved to tears and they said, "This is the best concert I have I never seen." And that's because this group of older adults said to themselves, said to society, said to their choir director, you know, I'm 65 so what? I'm 83, I still have a voice, it may not sound like it did when I was 30, but I can still sing and I'm going to belt(ph) it, right? And so, this is just an another example that's being documented pretty well, about how you can actually be thriving in your older years? It doesn't have to be a time of decline. It can … And there was this one lady in the documentary and all she kept saying was, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, and I tell myself that message often, I think I can, I think I can, when I'm working with older adults because so much of the time messages in our society tell older adults that it's a time of decline. Oh, I want to change that, I think it can be a real time for people to be thriving. So, how can we help people to do this, because we know it's not easy? So again, I mentioned at the beginning there is a few different areas we can focus on. We can focus on whether or not people have diseases, we can focus on engagement and productivity productively, excuse me, engaging with life, right and that's what we're going to focus on. So life engagement, this is where counselors can make the most impact. So, the first thing that you can do is to build on older adults, strengths, but you know, I was going to say that. And so one main way that you can do that is to support the coping techniques that they have. So, some people have very adaptive coping, they have found ways to give through those transitions by humor and alterism(ph), other people don't have as effective coping techniques. And so we can help them by doing role plays, by giving them examples, by having them interview people, watch movies, read books about people who are able cope more successfully than they may be have been able to, to show them a pathway for coping. We also know that the counseling foundation is focused on wellness. So, for older adults as with people of every age we wanna focus on wellness. How is the individual experiencing their spiritual life? How are they experiencing their level of humor in their life? Right? How are they… although there is a lot of things out of their control, what is in their control? Let's focus on what they can do in those areas. Also, we want to celebrate the personality traits that are working for them. So, people who like to have fun, people who have a good sense of humor, people who are friendly, people who are happy, let's bring those strengths out a little bit more, so that they can… these older adults can enjoy their later years. No, not everybody is going to be happy all the time, and I'm not even suggesting that that's productive, but find the things, the traits that are working and help them to cultivate that in their lives, because that's what's going to bring them the most joy and satisfaction as they get older. We also know that older adults with more positive self-perceptions of ageing in general will live longer than people who have negative perceptions. So, if you think about ageing and you think, "Ah-ah, that's not for me. I can't handle that." Chances are you may not actually get to experience that, but if you have a positive view of ageing, like, some people do in other societies, you may be more willing to take care of yourselves in the way that's going to nurture yourself to live that longer life. So, we can build on an older adult strengths. Another thing that we can do as counselors is that we can help older adults build a strong social network. There is a lot of research that suggest individuals who have strong social ties are going to be better functioning individuals, they are going to adapt from changes and challenges more quickly and readily than those who don't have a social support system. Now this is might vary a bit from, you know, among different genders. Sometimes people look to their partners or their family members for support, sometimes people look to neighbors or friends, right or people at their religious institutions. It doesn't matter where people are getting social support as long as it positive, as long as it is genuine support. And research shows that individuals who have more socialization, show less decline and functioning over time. So, who doesn't want to have friends and spend time out together? One great example of that is, the purple hat ladies, I don't know if you've ever seen these individuals who can sometimes go out and take over a restaurant, but essentially the idea is, they wear purple and red and they are older women, this is a group typically for older women and they get together and they eat and they celebrate and they experience life and my God, they have a great time. And although there are things that are happening in their life, they are probably aren't great, they get together on a monthly basis to celebrate what is going well with their relationships. And you… And you better believe that those types of experiences help people get through the tough times. So, the last couple areas are productivity and engagement. And so, there are several different areas that older adults can increase their productivity and engagement when it's physical activity and of course you want to always work with the doctor or medical provider in consultation with them, to find ways to increase physical activity. One example is, I've worked with older adults caregivers and we actually started a yoga group for people who were 70 and older and you better believe when they… when I first proposed this to them, they all looked at me like are you crazy, yoga at my age and yet it was able to help them decrease their stress, it was able to help them find balance, practice mindfulness and it really worked. I was… I was actually pleasantly surprised after a year of this study at how well it really help these older adult caregivers to find more meaning in their lives and to find more physical health in their lives as well. We want to incorporate mental… positive mental health, help them really with these changes and roles, help them to develop a strong sense of who they are at their core, regardless of if you have a partner who is living, regardless if you have children who are living, regardless of if you're in your job right now, who are you at your core, at your essence. I did another study with some colleagues and we found that actually volunteerism is a strong predictor of satisfaction in older adults. And so people who have the means and the time to get out there and volunteer, this increases mattering among older adults, the feeling like what you're doing is significant and it means something to others. And it also increases your social connections with other people. So, if you have an older adults, encourage them to get out and volunteer. It's amazing how much of a difference that that… you know five or 10 hours a week even can contribute to a person's wellbeing. And so, one of I think the best examples of positive ageing is and one of my favorite books called Tuesdays with Morrie And this book chronicles the end of life of a professor and the final lessons that he teaches to one of his former students. And every Tuesday he meets with his former student Mitch and he shares with Mitch the stories, the trials, the tribulations about life and one of the weeks he talks about ageing. And I'm just going to read an exert from, Tuesdays with Morrie, from Morrie's own words. "The young are not wise. They have very little understanding about life. Who wants to live every day when you don't know what's going on. Weren't you ever afraid to grow old I asked? Mitch, "I embrace ageing." "Embrace it?" "It's very simple, as you grow you learn more. If you stayed 22, you'd always be as ignorant as you were at 22. Ageing is not just decay, you know its growth. It's more than the negative, it's the positive that you understand while you're going to die, you can live a better life because of it." "Yes, but if ageing were so valuable, why do people always say, oh, if I were young again? You never hear people say, I wish I were 65." He smiled. "You know what that reflects, unsatisfied lives, unfulfilled lives, lives that haven't found meaning, because if you found meaning in your life, you don't want to go back. You want to go forward. You want to see more, do more. You can't wait until 65." And for all of you, I hope that you can't wait until you are 65, because you are doing the things in your life and cultivating your clients, so that they can live successful and positive lives in their older years.
