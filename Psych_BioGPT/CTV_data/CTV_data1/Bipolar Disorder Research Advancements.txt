PERRY KRICHMAR MD, FAAC Welcome to Healthy Body Healthy Mind, I am Dr. Perry Krichmar as with mental illness these are lot of fear, mystery and misunderstand surrounding bipolar disorder, but with proper treatment and support patient's avoid bipolar can live protective and fulfilling lives. 

00:02:20
[sil.] 

00:02:25
NARRATOR This is woman Khris Black has been living with bipolar disorder for as long as she can remember. 

00:02:30
KHRIS BLACK Patient The depression was a constant since I was about 2-years-old I remember feeling down and discouraged and… and it took the adrenalin to get me going, but the fact was I was a functional bipolar. 

00:02:45
PERRY KRICHMAR Despite of condition Khris had a successful and look at of carrier early on, but eventually the symptoms of the disorder began to interfere with both her personal and professional relationships. 

00:03:00
KHRIS BLACK And was very hard to get the way I was in life and all the people that I had helped even their for ah… were just abandoning in left and right because something was wrong with my brain and they don't want to be involve. 

00:03:10
LYDIA LEWIS President, Depression & Support Alliance So many people think that if you have bipolar disorder you are weak or you have a character defect or personality flow and this idea there this idea that you can pull yourself up by a bootstraps that this illness is somehow your fault and people couldn't be any more… more incorrect if they tried. 

00:03:35
KHRIS BLACK Since bipolar is a disease of instability difficulty maintaining relationships can be quite common. 

00:03:45
TRISHA SUPPES MD, PhD UT Southwestern Med. School So you often see with people have the illness you want fully stable is they have a lot of chaos and disruption and their professional life and their personal life and in their family relations. 

00:03:55
> NARRATOR Khris thought about seeking professional help right away, but she was afraid of being stigmatized as mentally unbalanced. 

00:04:05
KHRIS BLACK So I get that block me in a rubber room and throw away the key and I will be this pathetic raving person of rest of my life. 

00:04:15
PERRY KRICHMAR Without the treatment she needed and the support of family and friends Khris felt alone and scared. 

00:04:20
KHRIS BLACK I got so depressed and so the president I saw no way out and I saw in a hope because I never heard of this staff. I had no glue that anybody really know what was going on. 

00:04:30
TRISHA SUPPES Bipolar disorder can be a very difficult illness to experience you know it's not like a broken leg for having one conceive broken your leg they can relate to it. 

00:04:40
Bipolar Depression Sadness Helplessness Guilt Lack of energy Suicidal thoughts Bipolar Mania Increased energy Unrealistic beliefs Reckless behaviors Racing thoughts Drug abuse Increased sex drive Bipolar Disorder Loss of employment Ruined relationships Suicide 

00:04:45
PERRY KRICHMAR It is estimated that four percent of all Americans suffer from bipolar disorder or manic-depressive illness. A condition marked by extreme depressive lows and adrenalin rush, manic highs. The lows can include symptoms of major depression such as bipolar depression such as sadness, helplessness, guilt, lack of energy and suicidal thoughts. Whereas manic episodes can include bipolar mania increased energy and unrealistic belief in ones powers, reckless behaviors, racing thoughts, desire to abuse drugs and increased someone sex drive. This over paroling mental state of confusion can lead to loss jobs, ruined relationships even suicide. Although Khris Black never attempted suicide she remembers coming close. She says a letter from a friend was a turning point in her life. 

00:05:45
KHRIS BLACK A friend sent me a FedEx that had the ad for bipolar depression and I got very offended how dare are them and apply that I was mentally ill for haven't says this, tremendous stigma and I would be part of that, but then I would suggest and when I went right in they did three interviews at one time and said we don't see how are you still alive in this depressed. 

00:06:05
PERRY KRICHMAR Although it took many years to properly diagnose her condition Khris is fast in mandating once again with the help of family support, therapy and the proper combination of medications. 

00:06:15
KHRIS BLACK There is nothing, nothing that could be more valuable then having my brain work. 

00:06:25
PERRY KRICHMAR So what is happening in the brain of a patient with bipolar disorder. The simple answer is the brain is not normal and there are chemical imbalances. But Dr. Josh of Calibre says the complete answer remains a mystery. 

00:06:35
JOSEPH CALABRESE MD Case Western Reserve University When I comes to what is going on biologically in the brain. We have hints of what's going on. We know that there are changes and neuropeptides and changes in neurotransmitters. We know that when someone is depressed, certain substances tend to decrease and we know that when someone is in a manic episode or a high other substances tend to increase. For now, Khris is doing the best she can, with what is known about the condition. She is learning to balance her life, so manic and depressive episode occur less frequently. 

00:07:20
KHRIS BLACK Walking and being around loving people and avoiding people later mean a nastiest as much as possible and having pets and just doing peaceful things is a absolutely critical. 

00:07:35
PERRY KRICHMAR Why did it take Khris so long to be properly diagnosed? Social stigma may have played a role, but the complexity of the disease maybe the real culprit here. We will take a look at that next, but first a healthy body, healthy mind did you know. 

00:07:45
DID YOU KNOW THE Symptoms of bipolar disorder may be more difficult to recognize in children than adults? The symptoms can often be confused with age-appropriate emotions and behaviors, or even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. www.healthybodyhealthymind.com. 

00:07:50
NARRATOR DID YOU KNOW Symptoms of bipolar disorder may be more difficult to recognize in children than adults? The symptoms can often be confused with age-appropriate emotions and behaviors, or even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. For this another health related information please visit our website at www.healthybodyhealthymind.com. 

00:08:20
PERRY KRICHMAR So why is it so difficult the properly diagnosed bipolar disorder? Here is field correspondent Juile Donaldson to tell us more. 

00:08:30
Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder CORRESPONDENT Juile Donaldson 

00:08:35
JUILE DONALDSON It is estimated there between 60 and 90 percent of bipolar patients have their first symptoms before the age of 20, but a proper diagnosis often comes many years later, Kara Richards knows this first hand. 

00:08:50
KARA RICHARDS Patient I would say that I really had symptoms back from when I was in early teens, but had no idea when it was that will really affected my school work, my interaction with other people and it just made it difficult to settle down and make decisions that I should have been making when I was in high school and actually rolling into the college as well. 

00:09:20
JUILE DONALDSON She knew her behavior including severe mood swings and unusual highs and lows was out the norm but she cannot pinpoint why? Kara believes this is one reason she did not seek help sooner. 

00:09:35
KARA RICHARDS You just figure yet to know I will be that way, so to me since I had been that way since I was the young child it was normal. 

00:09:45
JUILE DONALDSON Lydia Lewis, president of the depression & bipolar support alliance says Kara's story is not uncommon. 

00:09:50
LYDIA LEWIS The main reason that they don't get help it is they don't know what it is and don't know how to recognize it. So I would say that the vast number of people they don't go to the doctor are not in denial, the problem is that they don't know that the real. When you have mania, you can feel very good so why would you go to the doctor. 

00:10:20
JUILE DONALDSON Social stigma can also play a role leading to his drunk feelings of denial. 

00:10:25
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD MD Univ. of Texas, Galveston Unfortunately bipolar disorder is one of the most denied illnesses that we as psychiatrists have to deal with. People really fight or deny that they have the illness and unfortunately that can have disasters consequences. 

00:10:45
JUILE DONALDSON They many believe the complexity of the disorder itself seems to be the biggest obstacle and diagnosing this often deadly condition. The problem is bipolar disorder can take many different forms. 

00:10:55
Bipolar I Disorder Classic form Recurrent mania and depression Bipolar II Disorder Mild mania Alternating depression Mania may be missed 

00:10:55
NARRATOR The classic form of the illness is bipolar I disorder which is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by mild episodes of mania alternating with depression. This mania is so mild it may not even be noticed by the patient, family or friends. As professor Robert Hirschfeld explains is mixed bank of emotions is whether confusion often begins. 

00:11:30
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD Most commonly it looks like depression. People come in to see the doctor, to see their counselor and they depressed and they don't tell the doctor or the provider that they have had hives, the doctor doesn't think to ask about because you can't imagine this person could ever been high and they miss it. 

00:11:50
JUILE DONALDSON But there was still a third form of bipolar disorder that can occur. No one has rapid cycling. Rapid cycling in bipolar disorder means if someone else four or more episodes a year, so it could be mania to depression. It could be four depressive episodes, about 20% of patients have at 15 to 20%. 

00:12:15
TRISHA SUPPES Is it possible to have both manic and depressive symptoms on the same day. 

00:12:20
JUILE DONALDSON Doctor say rapid cycling tense to occur later in the course of the illness and if left untreated the frequency and severity of the episodes tensed to increase. These are increases in severity can take the form of hallucinations often leading to yet further misdiagnosis of the condition. Experts say open communication is the best first step to correct diagnosis. 

00:12:45
TRISHA SUPPES I think to properly diagnose bipolar disorder its really a collaboration between the physician and the patient. The physician how easily has a lot of information about the illness and needs to be asking the appropriate questions and then the patient I think needs to be kind of on an educational exploratory journey. 

00:13:05
JUILE DONALDSON For Kara that journey meant learning as much about having bipolar as possible. Today she has a new outlook on her condition. 

00:13:15
KARA RICHARDS I am thinking this is not different and if I was diabetic and for the rest of my live whether I had to have shots of the insulin or I had to take some oral medication and go in for checkups to make sure my sugar level was fine, is no different from that that's another illness. Once I came to that conclusion just like, I am okay with this. 

00:13:45
PERRY KRICHMAR Once we are able to correctly diagnose bipolar disorder actually we would definitely can improve the life of the individual. Our treatments are moderately good and we will do a reasonable job of helping them get their lives in order and reducing the likelihood of future episode. 

00:14:10
JUILE DONALDSON It truly is amazing what a correct diagnosis can mean for a patient with bipolar disorder and here is a statistic for you Perry it takes an average of 7 years from the answer of the symptoms for the correct diagnosis to be made. 

00:14:20
PERRY KRICHMAR That's diagnosis statistic Julie, 7 years to make the correct diagnosis with this chronic condition that could be extremely dangerous. 

00:14:30
JUILE DONALDSON With us the prom Perry, with such a severe depression if it is left untreated can lead a suicide. 

00:14:35
PERRY KRICHMAR An untreated mania can lead to hallucinations, disordered thinking in allusions it's absolutely vital to make the correct diagnosis. Thanks. So wants to proper diagnosis is made what treatments are available for bipolar patients. That's next, but first a healthy body healthy mind Q and A. 

00:15:00
What can trigger bipolar disorder? Serious Loss Chronic Illness Drug Use Financial Problems Bipolar episodes can and often do occur without any obvious trigger. www.healthybodyhealthymind.com. 

00:15:00
NARRATOR Sometime is lift events such as a serious loss, chronic illness, elicited prescription drug use or financial problems can trigger in episode in some individuals with the predisposition to the disorder. There are other possible triggers of bipolar episodes. The treatment of depression with an antidepressant medication may trigger switch into mania. Sleep deprivation may trigger mania but it is important to know that bipolar episodes can and often do occur without any obvious trigger. For this another health related information please visit our website at www.healthybodyhealthymind.com. 

00:15:45
PERRY KRICHMAR When they comes to treating bipolar disorder one in the right doctor as well as the proper balance of medications, therapy and support can often be just as difficult as a diagnosis itself here is Carlos Baine with more. 

00:16:00
Bipolar Disorder Treatments CORRESPONDENT Carlos Baine 

00:16:05
[sil.] 

00:16:10
PERRY KRICHMAR Husband, father and businessman, John Abbott knows all two will be confusion isolation that often accompanies bipolar disorder. 

00:16:20
JOHN ABBOTT Patient We live in what I had just to change after a lot of depression. 

00:16:25
PERRY KRICHMAR Will John living with bipolar disorder was like being on a never ending rollercoaster ride. On a low day he loses appetite, switches days and nights and her feeling of unrelenting hopelessness. When he was manic he turn into superman trying to makeup for last time and individually fall back into a deep depression. 

00:16:45
JOHN ABBOTT But it's very hard on your family when I have come from two thirds of year and the preparation which like be in a dark hole toward getting caught up. 

00:17:00
CARLOS BAINE Correspondent John may not ever know exactly why he develop the condition but he does know that finding the correct treatment regimen was not easy in fact it took him nearly 20 years to find it. Unfortunately John'S experience is not an isolated case. 

00:17:15
LYDIA LEWIS There are many options available for the treatment of bipolar disorder, but it's a very very complex illness and I can take a number of tries before something is… is put together that a person can tolerate and that can help get rid of the symptoms. 

00:17:40
NARRATOR Kara Richards can relate, 

00:17:45
KARA RICHARDS As was most bipolar people it was very difficult to find the right treatment for me personally. I actually went through a five doctors and nothing worked. One of the medication that I felt like I was under water, my creativity just pushed out the door. All my background is in design and marketing which are two fields that it's absolutely necessary that should be created and took quite a while actually it took the better part of 6 years. 

00:18:20
NARRATOR In addition to the proper balance in medication encouraging family and friends make all the difference for bipolar patient. For John is biggest fan of his wife Barbara 

00:18:30
BARBARA ABBOTT Patient's Wife Well, I have John a life by given him support. They need a lot of support. I have got him in exercise program, I think that is encouraged him to try something new. We do a lot of things together and I think the Judith have to be there for them. 

00:19:00
NARRATOR Dr. Suppes says this kind of support and encouragement is invaluable. 

00:19:05
TRISHA SUPPES Part of the treatment force among with bipolar disorder used to include a significant other. Family member close support person some one who is involved in their life is there to help support them in it's very important I think to include them. 

00:19:20
NARRATOR Loved ones not only offer support there are also the first line of defense if something goes wrong. 

00:19:30
BARBARA ABBOTT When he goes in depression immediately we, I take him to the doctor so we get help right away. We don't just it and way in progress denied. We all getting him immediately. 

00:19:40
KHRIS BLACK My family knows and what is going on and my health is of course the awareness myself. I have such a better life, I have so much more balance in my life then I ever had. 

00:19:55
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD One of things they can make a break treatment. Is the presence of a loved one to significant another, a spouse, a I… I… I… grown child and so on. Helping out, being involved, coming to the doctor's appointments, giving information that the patient may not remember and not necessary won't talk about that can really make a huge difference in participating and looking for every time. 

00:20:25
NARRATOR Barbara believes the correct combination of medications is what has kept John Stable for the past five years. 

00:20:30
TRISHA SUPPES The medication treatment is a very important cornerstone, clearly a foundation of the helping that individual stabilize their life. 

00:20:40
BIPOLOR MEDIACTIONS may include mood stabilizers Lithium Lamotrigine Divalproex Carbamazepine Olanzapine 

00:20:40
NARRATOR Medications for patient with bipolar disorder may include mood stabilizers. Mood stabilizers include Lithium, Lamotrigine, Divalproex, Carbamazepine, Olanzapine are often taken over the course of years adding additional medications if necessary. 

00:21:00
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD Treatment constantly has to be adjusted. I can think of a single patient of mine whose has been on a single treatment regimen that's required no adjustment over let's say six months. 

00:21:15
NARRATOR And via medication options continue to increase finding the right medications for the right patient still takes time. But the correct medications are only affective when they are taking consisted by. 

00:21:30
TRISHA SUPPES Main thing we have learned at that bipolar disorder in the last 10 years is a very important to overall stay on the medications that if you don't take the medications in a regular way in fact the illness may go worse but, and there is also the possibility there repetitive episodes, more episodes will in fact cause a brain injury and some decrease in function. 

00:21:50
NARRATOR Doctors and healthcare professionals believe once bipolar patients and their loved ones understand how important the medications are to the quality of life and their ability to the function. There will be more incline to stay on the medications. 

00:22:10
CARLOS BAINE Educating patients about the various thing on the medication routine and educating the friends and family members about the medications and the side effects is believed to be the key, they keeping patients stable and improving the productivity and their overall well being. 

00:22:20
PERRY KRICHMAR And the good news is Carlos there is many more treatment today then in the past. 

00:22:25
CARLOS BAINE Yes, particularly in the past five years, there is been a big increase in the number of new treatments. 

00:22:30
PERRY KRICHMAR It is an exciting time, thanks Carlos. Let's take a look on which being done behind the scenes research to help site just understand which really going on in the brains of patients with bipolar disorder. 

00:22:45
NARRATOR For patients like Krish Black a new drug changed her life, but the breakthrough somehow more than medication. Imaging studies are also helping research as scenes of the brain. These scans may have researches identify any difference between the brains of people with bipolar disorder and people without the disease. And although brain scans may help detect bipolar disorder after symptoms have occurred, it is also a new interest in trying to detect the disorder before symptoms ever appear through gene therapy. These genes are the microscopic building blocks at DNA inside cells that affect have the body in mind work. This genetic material carries the code that increases the risk of bipolar disorder will be passed down through the generations. 

00:23:35
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD Bipolar disorder definitely runs in families. In general, the risk if you have bipolar disorder the risk of your, one of your kids having bipolar disorder is in the arrange of four to five times that above someone who does not have bipolar disorder. 

00:23:50
NARRATOR But like most medical conditions early detection is still considered extremely important. Dr. Robert Hirschfeld believe the creation of a standardized test to detect bipolar disorder early is saving lives. 

00:24:05
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD And we have this training instrument called the mood disorder questionnaire the NBQ, which an individual can fill out in a doctor's office in five minutes they can fill it out online, there is 13 yes/no questions. You can score yourself, the doctor or doctor's assistant can score and if you get a positive screen. Those are the people that you want to evaluate much more carefully for bipolar disorder. 

00:24:30
NARRATOR Even with advancements in the treatment of bipolar disorder many believe its still too soon to talk about a cure. 

00:24:40
ROBERT HIRSCHFELD Oh my gosh, so you that. I wish I could tell that we can cure it. [00:24:45And that I could say to you, you are never going to have another episode if you just stay and treat I can't say that, but I can say that we can reduce it by two to three times and we can definitely reduce the severity of the episodes. We can make your life much, much better. 

00:25:00
NARRATOR Like many patients living with bipolar disorder Krish Black shares this feeling of hope. 

00:25:10
LYDIA LEWIS Yes, incredible miracles will happen a better believe. We will have the answers, will we ever cure it completely I hopefully will. 

00:25:20
