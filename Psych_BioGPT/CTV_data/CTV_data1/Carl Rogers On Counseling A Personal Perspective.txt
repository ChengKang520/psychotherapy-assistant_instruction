NARRATOR Carl Rogers, the founder of Client Centered Therapy has been a major contributor to the field of counseling for over four decades. A former president of the American Psychological Association and the recipient of its award for outstanding professional contributions, he's authored such important books in the counseling field as Client Centered Therapy and On Becoming a Person. Since turning 65, he has written over 40 articles and his most recent books include On Encounter Groups, Freedom to Learn, Becoming Partners and On Personal Power. In this film, he turns his attention again to the field of counseling. With him for the interview is John M. Whiteley, a member of the Social Ecology Faculty and Dean of Students at the University of California, Irvine. 

00:01:50
JOHN M. WHITELEY Carl, what assumptions are you making about the nature of man on which you build your theory? 

00:01:55
CARL ROGERS  Well I think maybe there's, um, one assumption which has become more of a conviction based on experience for me and that is that the um human organism is a trustworthy entity, or to put in other words, persons can be trusted if you provide the right kind of psychological climate for them to open up and express themselves and uh, develop so that, um, it's uh it's assuming that the human organism is just like all other organisms in the universe that it can be trusted to move in a constructive direction, providing there aren't too many disturbing and warping circumstances surrounding them. 

00:02:45
JOHN M. WHITELEY Well, within a person then is a capacity for growth if you can create an environment which is can grow. Now, writing three decades ago you said that certain conditions are necessary and sufficient for providing for that change. From the perspective of being in encounter groups, thinking about men and women, writing on education and lately personal power, have you changed your view? 

00:03:20
CARL ROGERS I think that, um, my, um, belief in those conditions of, uh, empathy and congruence and uh, caring, whatever you wanna call it, uh, has, has deepened but it has also gone on beyond that. The one thing uh, the increasing amount of research supports the fact and certainly confirms the fact, um, those conditions do tend to facilitate constructive change in growth. But I think I've also come to feel that, um, place more emphasis on on the person of the therapist being present. Um, that you really have to be present to this other person in all aspects of your of your being and I don't know, I don't know that that's easy to define in intellectual terms. I know what it feels like when I feel really present to a person and I think I think they recognize that too. 

00:04:25
JOHN M. WHITELEY What does it feel like to you? You said you have that feeling within yourself. 

00:04:30
CARL ROGERS I feel as though I'm all there and all with this person. Um, I'm not, um, not holding myself back. 

00:04:40
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:04:40
CARL ROGERS  Um, uh, uh, well one way that I sometimes use is I feel as though I'm kind of transparent at that moment, that the person can really see through me. There's nothing, there's no, um, not putting up any barrier. I'm not hiding beyond anything. 

00:05:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY You're really being yourself. 

00:05:00
CARL ROGERS Um-hum. Being yourself. 

00:05:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY And in that sense one of your conditions is being very genuine. 

00:05:05
CARL ROGERS Um-hum. 

00:05:05
JOHN M. WHITELEY What about anger then. Is that anger something you've written and thought about? 

00:05:05
CARL ROGERS  Yes it is. It's something that, uh, has always been some kind of a problem with me. I don't express anger easily, but there I think that, um, my experience in encounter groups has helped me to be more free in expressing anger. Um, for whatever reason, I really don't often feel, I don't think that I've really ever felt angry in dealing with an individual client, but I have felt angry in groups. 

00:05:40
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:05:40
CARL ROGERS And, um, have learned to, uh, try to express that anger when it occurs. What I usually do is, uh, what I used to do and don't do quite so often would be to actually be angry and not realize it until afterward and I like it so much better when I can be aware of it and feeling it and express it toward the person or the situation that really aroused the anger. So, I'm learning, but I still have plenty to learn. 

00:06:05
JOHN M. WHITELEY  Is there a conflict between the genuine that you were speaking of and the transparency on the one hand and the caring on the other if you're really angry at somebody? 

00:06:20
CARL ROGERS That's why, um, I put congruence as genuine as first. In other words, I think it's very valuable if you can feel a caring for this person. But if what you are at that moment is angry at him, it's far better to be angry than to pretend to care that you don't really feel. 

00:06:35
JOHN M. WHITELEY And let them know that there's a, that sharing of it is also important 

00:06:40
CARL ROGERS That's right. 

00:06:40
JOHN M. WHITELEY In the relationship. 

00:06:40
CARL ROGERS  Um-hum. In any close relationship, people always feel, I think, how risky it is to share negative feelings with someone that you feel caring to. 

00:06:55
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:06:55
CARL ROGERS And, uh, that that is a constructive thing to do. 

00:07:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY What is it that you do that helps another person change their behavior? 

00:07:05
CARL ROGERS Uh, I think, uh, what I do is simply to provide the climate we've talked about, but what brings about change in behavior in this other person is the gradual change in concept of self, that then the person comes to see himself or herself um, in a new way so it moves from feeling unworthy and, uh, lacking in confidence and, uh, all that to feeling of greater confidence, greater sense of worth, greater liking of self, then the behavior begins to change as a result of that. Some are very uh researched quite long ago suggested the support of that in a, in a modest kind of way that I, I certainly have come to believe it clinically very strongly, that changes in behavior, uh, follow changes in, in the way a person sees himself or herself and the way that he feels about self. 

00:08:05
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum and the client has some real choice about how to direct their own growth, I think, which is a very different model then the behaviorists sort of Freudian. 

00:08:15
CARL ROGERS That's true. I think that when, when there comes about this change in feelings about self, then, uh, you get a um, a realization I have a choice. I can behave in the old way or I can behave in a new way. 

00:08:35
CARL ROGERS And this relates back to the first assumption we began with that the people have the capacity within themselves to make changes wisely and growthfully for them. 

00:08:40
CARL ROGERS Yes, I think that um, my experience has been if I'm able to do a satisfactory job of providing these conditions that we've talked about, uh, then I can really trust the, the fact that the person will move in directions that are not only personally constructive, but socially constructive. 

00:09:05
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:09:05
CARL ROGERS And that seems, I know that seems strange to some people. Why would they move in directions that are socially constructive? I believe it's because uh of the species that we belong to. Man is essentially a social animal and prefers to live in harmony with others, um, in spite of all the wars and rumors of wars going on. Um, given the opportunity for free choice, he prefers a harmonious relationship with others rather than a disharmonious relationship. 

00:09:40
JOHN M. WHITELEY What do you do in terms of method when you're working with a client? Do you use confrontation as a technique? 

00:09:50
CARL ROGERS  I would say that, uh, the times when I'm most unhappy with myself as a counselor are those times when catch myself using a technique. Now, uh, that doesn't mean that I'm not um, open to knowing about techniques. 

00:10:10
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:10:10
CARL ROGERS I'm open to using them, if they feel so spontaneous at the moment, but it's not a technique. That's when, uh, uh, you know, whether you call this a technique or not, it's something that's very real to me. Uh, I've learned to trust my intuition. Uh, sometimes in the midst of an interview, something will crop up especially if I'm quite close to this client, feel in tuned with this client, something will crop up in me that wants to be said and it may have no relationship with what's going on. It may seem from my intellectual point of view totally foolish to say that, but I've learned to trust it and to say that and I would say eight times out of ten, it proves to be something very meaningful to the client. 

00:11:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY  You really allow yourself that same trust in yourself that you're attributing to the client. 

00:11:10
CARL ROGERS It's, it's yeah, it's been increasing. 

00:11:10
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. What about reflecting? I think there's probably been no aspect of your work that's been more singled out for analysis and perhaps misunderstanding 

00:11:20
CARL ROGERS Yes. 

00:11:20
JOHN M. WHITELEY And reflecting. What do you mean and what do you want people to understand about what you mean? 

00:11:30
CARL ROGERS Yes, there are statements like client-centered therapy is simply the reflection of feelings. Well, um, I think we may have been responsible for starting that term. If so, I regret that because the real in is to understand the feeling. In other words, I wanna be a companion to the client and be right with him or her in, um, exactly what's going on inside at the moment. The only way I can find that out whether I am being that sort of companion is to check it. 

00:12:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:12:00
CARL ROGERS Um, is this what you've been trying to say? Is this what you're feeling? 

00:12:05
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:12:05
CARL ROGERS Um, it sounds as though you're experiencing such and such. And if the answer is no, no, then I would drop that immediately. That's so that what is termed reflection of feelings is an attempt to check my understanding of what's going on inside the, the client with his understanding of it and, and therefore to correct myself so that I can go in the same path that he's following. 

00:12:35
JOHN M. WHITELEY So, you do it both to correct yourself and to let the client know that I understand what you're saying. 

00:12:45
CARL ROGERS That's right and it, um, it can be, uh, a very rewarding and opening thing for a client to realize my God. You understood that? Nobody ever understood me before. I think that we have no realization of the fact that real empathic understanding is one of the rarest things in the experience of any of us and to find out that I bring out something, uh, that I as a client, bring out something very tentative, something I'm afraid of, something I've never told anyone else, and this other person seems to really understand it not in a general way, but in its nuances and in its, uh, um, delicate shadings. Wow. That's a tremendous experience. I'm no longer so alone and it, uh, and then it also means that I'm encouraged to say more. I'm encouraged to go further into myself. If I can be understood at this level, than perhaps I can be understood at still another level and there's one other function that serves too, that probably should be mentioned. That is that to, um, if someone expresses and confused and, uh, difficult feeling, do you have that uh, to find that the other person understands it in somewhat different terms is often very terrifying. In other words, oh yeah. That what, that's what I've been that's what I've been trying to say and you see a look of real relief at the greater clarification that, um, the client feels. 

00:14:15
JOHN M. WHITELEY  What about insight, um, insight as another uh dimension that that's been talked about a lot. What is insight in your own model? 

00:14:30
CARL ROGERS Well, I think um, in the earlier formulations, I used the term insight quite a lot. I doubt if I have used that for quite a number of years because I think the much more accurate term, no not, there is such a thing as insight, but the more accurate change agent is experiencing. I think, for instance, I recall an interview I had just recently where a client wanted to express some of the, uh, deep hurt that he felt, but he, he went all around that, describing it, talking about it, and only for one moment did he let himself really experience that hurt. That's when he can let himself experience the hurt fully, but then there's the, then there's a chance of sensing it at a gut level and really being able to change. That's what that's insight of a of a gut level sort. 

00:15:30
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:15:30
CARL ROGERS Uh, I think everyone realizes this is often talked about, uh, people can have all kinds of intellectual insight and it doesn't change their behavior a particle. 

00:15:40
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:15:40
CARL ROGERS They can know about the causes of behavior in their childhood and all the traumas they've had and so forth and their behavior may remain exactly the same. On the other hand, if they'd experienced some deep feeling aspect that has been buried in the past, then you're going to find that's an open to change. 

00:16:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY  Because having an understanding of those feelings in an emotional sense frees one to continue to grow. 

00:16:10
CARL ROGERS  There's, it's as though, uh, if your feeling has been deeply buried and now I'm able to let myself experience it fully, then I can move on beyond that. Up to that point, it's been something blocking my development, blocking my forward movement, but if I can let myself realize oh, I am hurting, and really let that soak in, then I can begin to let that hurt go by and move on to other phases of existence. 

00:16:45
JOHN M. WHITELEY You've already pointed out how you're really using experiencing instead of insight and while you may have introduced it with one set of meanings originally, you have a very different set of confections about what you mean and what that conveyed. Are there some other changes over the last several decades as you've broadened into encounter groups and, uh, applied your thinking to men and women, and to personal power with it, you would single out as important? 

00:17:20
CARL ROGERS One thing that comes to mind is that, uh, I have become much more aware of the power aspect of all of these relationships, whether we're talking about teacher student or therapist client whatever and I realized that the stance I take on that is actually a very radical stance, um, that I try in every way possible whether I'm talking about students or clients, or, or, close relationships like marriage relationships, my desire is to keep the, uh, power with that person, to empower the person, not to power over, but to help them sense his or her own power and begin to utilize it and, and uh, realize I do have the strength and capacity to do things for myself and that to me is, uh, I say it's, uh, very different than most approaches because, uh, most therapists, most teachers, um, have, that have varying degrees of authority over the other person. I feel I am the expert and therefore I'll, I'll I know what you should learn or I know what's wrong with you, um, and so it is a uh, empower relationship. 

00:18:45
JOHN M. WHITELEY Well, it seems to me in education, you've, you've remarked that one person can't teach another person anything worth learning and it seems that you hold that same model for individual growth as well. 

00:19:00
CARL ROGERS That's right. In fact, the, uh, the realization of that came first in, in counseling because I started out, uh, in times that of course the counselors' function is, of course, to tell the client what to do. 

00:19:15
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:19:15
CARL ROGERS And I was, uh, it's interesting to look back on that and see I gradually drew back and drew back and drew back from that because it was so damned and defective. I've, uh 

00:19:25
JOHN M. WHITELEY So you move away from it because it didn't work. 

00:19:25
CARL ROGERS That's right. 

00:19:30
JOHN M. WHITELEY Not because you somehow challenged initially the knowledge at power. There's a professional mystique in counseling. 

00:19:30
CARL ROGERS  No, all those things came later, but I because I was, uh, just as much, uh, expert oriented as the next person when I started in, but I think I have always been quite pragmatic and have tried to follow up clients and follow up, um, a learning process in the students and so on. I came to realize that, uh, if I want to look very smart, then play the part of the expert. That looks good. If I want to really um, foster a process of learning, then empower the person and create a climate very, facilitated climate where that person can learn the things that he or she needs to learn. 

00:20:20
JOHN M. WHITELEY Okay, so challenging really the power basis of our society's organization is one major change that's occurred over the last several decades. Would you single out any more? 

00:20:35
CARL ROGERS  Certainly, um, I am certain I can detect another change in practice and that is that, um, initially partly because I was so enamored with, um, the fact that the client did have capacity to move forward, and partly I think because, uh, my own insecurities in interpersonal relationships, I was more aloof from the, uh, from the client. Um, I did try to facilitate things, but keeping myself quite out of it. Now I would feel that I want to be there with my feelings too, um, but I don't want to, but my feelings I like to own my feelings, not as something that you should be feeling and, um, and so it's a more personal, warmer, closer, um, more intimate relationship. Then another change I've noticed in myself is that, uh, I am no longer so afraid of intimacy. I wouldn't have thought of touching a client during the interview when I first started. Now, that comes very naturally. 

00:21:50
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. Think that's in part of result of the encounter group? 

00:21:50
CARL ROGERS Yes it is. Um-hum. Um-hum. I feel as though I've encounter group movement and being in groups myself, as, uh, helped me to change and grow. 

00:22:00
JOHN M. WHITELEY How, this gets to the next question I was going to ask you, how has your life been shaped in your own personal understandings clarified as a result of your role as a counselor and a person who's thought about counseling very carefully? 

00:22:15
CARL ROGERS Well, it's only changed every aspect of my life, that's all. I would say that uh, as I recall that first I began to realize if I deal with a client, this way, why do I deal with a committee or the staff so much differently? So then, I began to change some administrative functions and if I deal with a client that way, how come I don't deal with my children that way? 

00:22:45
JOHN M. WHITELEY Um-hum. 

00:22:45
CARL ROGERS Uh, How come I don't deal with my own wife that way? I can't think of any aspect of my life that hasn't been, that hasn't been changed by, uh, by my experiences as a counselor. What I would say to sort of sum that up is that I think one reason people are drawn to this, uh, person centered way of working, is that it is a person centered way of being. It isn't just something you put on for certain hours. It really is, a, um, a lot of convictions about the way life is, and, um, trying to live that way. 

00:23:25
JOHN M. WHITELEY How do you translate this to the goals that you'd like to, uh, see clients achieve as the result of working with you. This is clearly a value question and, and saying that counseling isn't value free in its most basic sense. What are your values in the clients? 

00:23:45
CARL ROGERS Uh, my one prime value is the person and so if, this client comes out of the process more confident as a person, more free as a person, more open to all aspects of their experience and therefore more able to, um, choose intelligently among the behavior options and so on, um, more of a person in intimate relationships, therefore more free to love, um, or to withdraw from a relationship if it's a hurtful relationship, that I would like that person to be as, as open to themselves and as open to the environment as possible. Then, they will do creative things that I think they will find their life more fulfilling, uh, and so it's a uh, it's a goal which has no specifics. In other words, it isn't saying so then they will behave and just this way or that way. It's, uh, the kind of uh, inner sense of I am a free, responsible, potent person. That would, that would be what I would hope clients would, uh, tend to feel.
