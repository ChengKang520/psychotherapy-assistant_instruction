I wished to live deliberately, to confront only the essential facts of life… and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. 

00:00:05
- Henry David Thoreau 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN I've always thought of this quote also, "you know, being essential to what's most important uh…in terms of living one's own life." To be deliberate about it. You know, so that you can make sure that the one thing that you did not neglect to do, was really live. You know, so many people put off things to later. I thought about this a lot. I had a rare opportunity to lose a lot of people in my life at a very young age. Now, it sounds different but when I say that, I mean, sincerely that to lose people you love, you know, at a young age certainly calls attention to what time we really have and, and how much we need to appreciate every single moment we have and how, how dangerous it is to not live deliberately and to put it on halt. All right. So, that, that, that, that thing really resonates with me and I think it is, it certainly led me into this work without a doubt.

00:01:35
UNKNOWN This class has been taught now for ten years and at the present nearly everybody in the senior class takes it. It's really grown. And when I say grown, it's because it's a choice, it's an elective. These students choose to cross the threshold and walk in and work with the dying. Uh…I think part of that choice really also has to do with, it being an experience like no other. And, you know, when I say that, it's, it's not about the magnitude of, of, of death and dying so much. I think as if it's, the fact that they are actually being with and caring for people who's lives are ending before their very eyes and these people know it. And so we begin by an open forum around the table where we, we openly share our, our, our death inventory so to speak. With this, bearing witness to one another as openly as possible and, and share with us not just that well, this person died, but anything about the experience, you know. That gets quite intense. 

00:02:45
[sil.] 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Tell us, share with us, what is your uh…experience with death? Who do you know? Do you know people that have died? Have you been with people that have died? Family members and pets, there is nothing trivial about that. There's people who have pets that are, as closer, closer than some family members and they die and there's a grief, it's real. Okay. So what is your death experience? As specific as you can be, try not to hold back. If it's feeling really uncomfortable and you just don't want to go there, please don't. You know, that's just up to you. But as much as you can share, umm…it's very important for all of us. You're gonna need each other, believe me. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN It's definitely different than I expected, but then again, what can you really expect out of a class that's… It's like, you read your schedules as hospice class. Like, what can you expect from those words? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN The first day of hospice was terrifying for me. Because, I mean, it's the first day of school and I have first period and I walk in and all your friends from summer. And I mean, I always knew that hospice was gonna be hard, but that first day of class was so intense because it's, it's very, it's serious and people are going around and like opening up. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN The person that was probably closest to me who's passed away is um…my grandpa, my dad side. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Being from a (inaudible ) third world country, I've, I've seen a lot of deaths really, people die from car accidents and everything and AIDS, that's the main cause of death there. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN It's also hard because my little brother Joe, he has remember my grandpa a lot. And he was such a big part of our lives, so… It's just difficult for me. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN It's kind of just a blur to me because I kind of think, I blocked it out. So I don't really talk about it that much. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN And I don't know. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN The environment I live in at home like now actually inside my home where I lived like that, intensifies it like, by like a thousand because, you know, people get shot every day. People get jump. People get stabbed… 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN As far as, being in the class in general like, you know, it's scary to open up about yourself and, you know, be exposed. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN When you get a group, there's an energy around the table that happens. Sooner or later, somebody either grabs with clean acts or you hear the cues and the crying and everybody's radar is up because they are all thinking the same thing. You know, I don't want to break down, I'm not gonna break down. And then there is the reaching out and trying to console and then next thing, you know, somebody else starts and there's a permission. And that's what I'm looking for and hoping for is that, they will just automatically, you know, open up that permission amongst themselves without me having to grant anything. 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN I think, he did it because um…it's a good way to establish trust like I had never kind of seen that side of a lot of people in my class. You know, I saw people very kind of raw and emotional and I think that you need to kind of start out with that to show each other that, you know, everybody has these feelings and, you know, it's, nobody can really deal with it alone. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN And I'm still worried about saying the wrong thing but he was my grandpa, so it's okay. So I saw him everyday after school because… It's hard. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN No, it's perfectly okay. It's perfectly okay. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Umm…I just, I think he wanted to show how much apart death is to our lives, and how we have all experienced it and we know how it feels to be that person who loves somebody and they passed. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN So now, there is a bare attention, a bare emotional situation that is available. Not everybody accesses it in the same way, some remain a bit resistant. You know, just the way it goes and others are totally open. Once one person opens up around the table and starts to talk, gets emotional, starts to talk about a lot of things that aren't just about death and dying. You know, other issues. More than, more often than not, they start to use this as a way to explore themselves. They are examining their own life in light of others. And there's a permission there. That examination and sharing around the table in an open forum, just takes the weight of secrecy out of the room. And it's like, oh, my God, I thought, I was the only one that felt that way. And it's, it's, it's more than okay. It's the way it should be. I am validated. I'm who I am. It's very powerful. 

00:08:00
UNKNOWN I don't think you can have like community without like sharing something vulnerable, you know, people wants to see something vulnerable about you. That's how you get together, all right. It's very important. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Both my grandparents have like stage 4 cancer. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN I've often been asked, not by the students but by many people. Why would young people elect, choose to take this course and be with the dying? Especially, when it's considered that youth are supposedly all about invincibility, you know, nothing about end of life. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we made a huge mistake, a profound error in our culture of death denial and youth worship. I mean, we are all always talking about young, healthy, never frail, the strong. You know, I've always found that the students I work with really and truly do want to care and nurture. And most of all through that nurturing and caring, to be connected to the entirety of life, to the whole thing. This course is really and truly all about life. Death is a part of life. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN At first, I did not want to take this class and course and everything. I thought, I was gonna drop out but after the first class, I just kind of fell in love with it and, you know, it's, it's very different. It's a very different experience and very different feelings that you get when taking it. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Someone get the candle. Thanks for sharing and we're coming tomorrow. Make sure that you have a journal by tomorrow, okay. Thank you. 

00:09:45
[music] 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN This is what we do for fun. 

00:09:55
[music] 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN It's our 17 of the 24 hour theater marathon where students write, direct and perform plays all in 24 hours. We've already written all the plays and right now everyone is learning their parts. 

00:10:20
[music] 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN What are you doing? 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN No, the other way. You never gets old, bad trick. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN I get up at 6 O'clock to live with the far away. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN When I wake up my dad like he turns on the light and he's like shouting my name you know, it's just like highly annoying. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Most of the time, I'm like in the car with just like a bond and like no makeup or half dress and then I do that on the way to school. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN I like lunch because I get to talk with people. 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN I only have one free period and I usually spend that eating food and then lunch where I eat some more. So I eat for about an hour and a half a day. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN I walk my dog and I usually procrastinate doing homework for a while. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN I always turn on the news and watch it while I do my homework. I try to get it done early but sometimes, I take a nap. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Where you're going to college? You know, what do you want to do with your life? What are you gonna… Where are you gonna be in ten years? And I don't know the answers to that at all. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN I like to bake and cook. My mom and I cook dinner a lot. 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN Uh…I like driving around and doing chores for my mom and dad because like they say, I'll pay for your gas if you run errands for us. I don't know, it's, it's fun, it makes me feel responsible and I'm like an adult. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN All the students that I've taught today are just regular, round of the mill, kids, students, come from a lot of different backgrounds. I think when we start talking about age, umm…we start to think about readiness umm…and if someone, perhaps, we don't think is ready, and they are and prove to be so that there's something extraordinary about them, something different. Everybody that I've taught this far in hospice, all these young people, they are just regular kids. They are just normal kids. What it's really about is the fact that the ability to empathize and work with other human beings in this way, to touch family members, to touch the dying, to bear witness to the dying. It's in their bones. It's in the bones of all of us. It's like a part of our DNA. 

00:12:50
[music] 

00:13:10
[sil.] 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Today is Tuesday September 18th, lunch is chicken breast, baked potato, Garden asparagus, meat roll and a cookie. And today's class with Mr. Penia(ph) is canceled. Uh…college visits today, it's Tuesday, Dickinson(ph) at 10:30 in the art loft and at 12 is champagne. I thought to express today, (inaudible ). That's it. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN All righty. Mouth care. It's a very intimate thing. We are really crossing boundaries when we start doing this kind of stuff. We are touching somebody and we are approaching them. We are even touching their personal space just by being in it without actually grabbing them or touching them or anything like this. So there is a language that happens here. All right, and it's uncomfortable at first. And like so many skills of tasks, this takes practice. It's presence that we're moving towards. That's the goal. The goal is to be able to have the chance to sit and be with that person and thus they are with us. Okay. But what I would like you to do when you take this is and I'll show you, is, hold it between your finger and thumb with, with the idea that if you, you kind of going in. We have a huge tidal wave of culture and societal pressure on us than to deny the very thing that we're teaching. We don't want to talk about death. We don't want to talk about dying. So what are you doing? How can we even get into the presence of that through our own fear of our own mortality? How can we manage that fear not get over it, manage it in a way that can bring us meaningfully to that other human being to allow us eventually to be able to connect. Well, we can do that through some loving tasks that are necessities, that are no-brainers. A mouth is dry, a glass of water. Someone has needing some help in turning in the bed, so that they, you know, you can be more comfortable. We have hands, we can help. Okay. Let me see. Let me get to her. You see this, like this, put it up like that and then take your hands and tuck this down inside. This is something I really want you to remember. So what we are doing now is trying to get them to find things that they can trust in themselves to be able to, tool skills that they could do and if they can also touch that person physically. By touching them, moving, turning, positioning. If I have to do that and I'm learning how to do that, that means, somehow, I got to get from here to here. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN For Glory. Yeah, new volunteers. I got an army for you. 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN This is the room. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Great. Thank you so much for coming. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN All right, when do you want to start? You want to start in October or you? 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Okay. And how do you spell your first name? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN JAMIR. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN JAMIR. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN This house here was built specifically to what we find here at Advent House. So, I'll give you a tour afterwards and you can see it, but it's, it's pretty nice. We would be relying on volunteers such as yourself. Okay the way the shifts work, they are four hours. You will never be here alone. There's always two volunteers at a time and you'll always be with somebody that's over 18. So uh…don't be afraid, if, you know, the first couple of times, you come in, you think, oh, how I'm gonna remember all these, because you will have somebody to spend with you for a long time. So umm…you can write your name down for your first shadowing and then when you come in for that shadowing, you can write your name down for the second one. Since there are so many of you, if you write them down for both it's gonna be kind of overwhelming. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Well, okay, for this like how has one time for the top and a different time for the bottom? 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN Yep. Like three to seven is… 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN So if we're shadowing, shadowing with her from 2 to 7 and with her… 4 to 8… Okay. 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:35
(crosstalk) 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN You'll find it very rewarding. You know, it seems like it's a sad place to work and, and we do have sad times, but when those families come in and they, they just depend on… 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN Okay, Thank you, guys. It is nice to meet you all. Bye-bye. Thanks. 

00:18:00
[sil.] 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN In hospice right now, we're reading Tuesdays With Morrie. Umm… it's really a great book. I'm halfway through it right now. And, I mean, it just talks about life and death and seize the day, carpedium. So it's just a great book so far. I'm getting really into it, it's really good. There is another book that the author wrote. I think, it's like "Seven People You Meet In Heaven," something like that. So, I might have to buy that after this because, this one's got me hooked. Oh, news is back on. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN They don't worried about hospice. 

00:18:55
[music] 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN I mean, even just like now I get nervous because like there is so much that that's like surrounding the idea of death like everyone will talk about, but I can't. 

00:19:20
[music] 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN I'm so afraid of doing anything wrong like, I know, everyone does this, but I guess, maybe I'm just extra sensitive to it like, I'll say something like, totally freaking wrong and like, it's just awkward and I beat myself up about it for days. Like what if I do that to a patient and then they like die, you know… Like that's the last thing that like I get to see and there is something stupid, something that hurts their feelings or something. Like, I don't know. Sometimes, I don't think you could say stuff that hurts people's feelings and like… And, but what if I don't get the chance to apologize, you know? It seems like a stupid thing to worry about. It's just like, I don't know, what really suck. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN So, today is my first shift on hospice. I'm going to the Advent House which is 20 minutes from my house and I'm kind of nervous because like I don't know what to expect. I'm worried that I'm gonna do something wrong like make someone worse or hurt someone externally or yeah. That's mostly what I'm nervous for. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Wait, wait, stop. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN So here's Joe. Here Emily on her way to her first shift at Advent House. That's Becky's house. So Emily, how are you feeling about going to Advent House for the first time? 

00:21:00
EMILY I'm a little nervous. 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Uh…Umm…I think that's pretty normal. 

00:21:10
EMILY Yeah. It's just like trying anything new. When you start something new, you are always kind of depressed. 

00:21:20
[music] 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN I think, it's coming up soon. Is it just before the light? 

00:21:30
EMILY Yeah. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Do you want me to come in with you or you're gonna be all right? 

00:21:35
EMILY I'll be all right. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN Are you taking the camera? 

00:21:35
EMILY Umm…Sure. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:21:40
[music] 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN Shall I… Shall I put my name on here? 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN I think, did you sign it already? 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN I don't think so. 

00:22:00
(crosstalk) 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN And then you're gonna be here at four… Four? So you put four there. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN This was like my first shift and I really just wanted not to get in the way, but like figure out what I would eventually be doing, you know. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN When you go in and… And Carol is a lucky one. She, she can swallow all at once. I'll introduce you. 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:23:05
(crosstalk) 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN This is Anna. 

00:23:20
ANNA Hi. I'm Anna, nice to meet you. Oh, I know it's so cold outside than standing here. I was super nervous. Umm…, walking in there for the first time, I wasn't really sure what to expect because obviously, you work with people all the time and in all different kinds of situations. But I… It's such a, delicate topic it seemed at the time to be working with someone who is actively dying. And I just, almost didn't know how to approach that. I guess, I was just trying to be myself. But it was definitely nerve wrecking. 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN What do you think, you want to do? 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN I get into history or political science. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Interesting. A law school in your future? 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Probably not. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Smart boy. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN A part lawyer or something. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN There are. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN They always talk about school and life and the future which is pretty interesting at a hospice place. They always ask you about like what are you your plans in 10 years, 20 years? Because I get there and they… We kind of pick up where we left off the conversation. So when you go there, you're not only meeting the residents, you're meeting the volunteers who want to know about your life and I want to know about their life and then it just kind of like, umm…just remembering life and what's in the future for everyone. Isabelle was there for the first shift that I ever had and she was one of the residents and she'd ring about every 20 minutes. Cigarette time, cigarette time, cigarette time and I actually came up with a schedule of when she could have a cigarette or not. And they always send me and I just tell her, no, because apparently I was the gentle one say, no, no, no cigarette, no. I've noticed that they are very relaxed when they smoke, you know. They will go out there and they will just start opening up about the weather and the trees swaying and the wind and kind of like an interesting deeper side that you don't usually see when they are in the bed. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN You can't just tell somebody to go reach out and touch someone. You have to have a permission. You have to have some kind of a methodology that's going to get you there, without it being the primary thing on your mind. It has to be authentic and natural. So how do you do that? I found that the best way to achieve that end is through some simple tasks. Teaching kids how to help someone else brush their teeth. Turn and position them in the bed. Hand massage, back massage, um…changing a brief or other things like that. Helping them stand, to be able to walk away from the bed and go to the commode. All of these actions or tasks that achieve a certain end, like clean teeth whatever. The main thing though is, is that all of these require an encounter that is all about touching someone else and the trust, that when you touch them, you'll be gentle and kind and they in return can reach out to you and allow themselves to be cared for by you. So once this is achieved, once they go and they start to do the work that touch happens and triggers something remarkable. It's an awesome enlightenment for both parties, when they connect. It's the stuff of true relationship. And when they do this, it's like electricity in the air. It's amazing. It's another kind of language, a different language between the two. Um….no one is ever the same after that. The story somehow of each person intertwine and for a moment there, there's just nothing in the room but beauty. 

00:27:50
[music] 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN I can't complain. I had a good life. And I had four children and my sister was never ever had children, so I know I have been blessed. You're a special girl. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN You're a special girl too. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Well, there's a lot of special people, but they were very few found and you are wonderful. You are. Thank you. 

00:30:30
[music] 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN I expected it to always be very sort of a somber environment at the house. Umm…and I mean, certainly that's been my experience at times. But almost an equal measure, it's been very inviting and hopeful and like happy. I think umm…one of the first questions I asked him was, if he liked it there and he, and he just said, yes, nice people, wonderful people. And he, he just made me really happy that he's having that wonderful experience there. 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN I introduce myself. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN Great. Hi, girls. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN Hi. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN We're guys. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN I see that. 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN And what's your name? 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN I'm Anna. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Anna, Tony… 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Kelly. We have a picture of all our kids, even Johnny, my kids and I think. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN John, he couldn't speak very well, but you still completely knew how much he loved his friends and what kind of special connection he had with all of his buddies, and they, you know, expressed the same sort of just raw love. 

00:32:20
(crosstalk) 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN It's just scary like going up to college and we're all splitting up. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN But true friends will always be there, even a year goes by. I know, how you feel. I know what you mean. 

00:32:40
ANNA I made pen friends forever. They were just always there for each other and like he said, you know, a true friend is there for you. you know, maybe it will be years between the time that you see them again, but a true friend is always there for you and that really touched me. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN I guess our first, like if I wasn't, if I wasn't really doing anything like I just thought, I was kind of, umm…like a burden, like kind of just like wasting space, not really helping out at all. But umm…yeah, I don't really feel that way anymore. It's enough to just be there with the person umm…like just your presence is all that's really needed sometimes. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Feet on the floor flat, back straight, have your eyes closed or open, doesn't matter to be. Just be in this moment. Loving kindness, moving to acts of unconditional love without thinking that there will be anything given to you in return. Even the consideration that the person that you're giving this to could even be receiving it. You just give it because that is what needs to be done. It's just the giving and the cultivating of loving kindness. It's really difficult to have a real experience these days. And for the students, their world is becoming more and more virtual. Now it's more about pushing a button or touching a screen than it is reaching out to another human being and holding hands or shaking a hand or just being in their presence. I worry about that. Umm… I think that as Einstein who said something about, will be day when uh…our technology supersedes our humanity. And, uh…, you know, one of my biggest hopes in this program is for uh…these students to be able to uh…see the world in a larger context than just a virtual one. If you had to pick a memory, it has to do with your going to the house and giving care umm…either a situation or with the person, what would it be? What would you choose? If you have many things, that's great, pick one. And then the other pieces… If you still have things that make you uncomfortable, that's fine. Kind of work, we're still kind of lingering on and makes you still feel a bit uncomfortable that you're still struggling with, okay. And anybody who wants to go, go first, can go. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Umm…So on my last shift, I was, I went into the room to see Carol and she can't, she can't say a word, she can say yes or no, but since she had stroke, she can't make, make words. And so I went into the room and I said, hi, Carol, I'm just coming to check on you and she had this huge smile and she said, oh, hi, and then she tried to say my name and it was, it was so nice because she, she normally accept that but umm… and she can't say words, but she tried to say my name and that was really nice. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN I think something that still makes me uncomfortable is when we have to tell them no for some reason, like, I've had several times where Carol has asked me to get out of bed and she can't and so I had to tell her, no. And it's, it's, I don't know, it's all comforting them and then, I don't know, it's just the fact that they are asking and they, they want you so badly, it's like their last request. I just want to get out of bed and I'm like, you can't. And then like Mary, like she wanted a BLT and she's on like a liquid diet and stuff like that. Like, I don't know, I just, that still makes me really uncomfortable with them, but yeah. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN And you had mentioned earlier on in the… When you first started, something could die on your shift and then you're terrified, that was the word you used is terrified, okay? And is that kind of ebbed a little bit, not, not as bad? 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN It's gone. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Really? 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN What do you think up with that? 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN Well. 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN I just sad down, I was like these people are very lovely. They are gonna be your force for time. As long as they are here, they are gonna be with you. And if they are not here, that's it. So it's gonna be very hard but we'll find out a way to do it. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN I guess, if I'm nervous about something or whatever, umm… When it's quiet, I'm not sure, if I should talk or not because if I were to talk, like I want to talk to them, you know, but if they are not saying anything, maybe they don't want to talk. And if I were in their position, I wanted to be rude and be like, I don't want to talk or anything. And I don't want to put them in that position where they don't want to say, I don't want to talk and I'm forcing them to talk. So I'm talking and they don't want to be rude. So I'm not sure, if I could say something and not so. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN You're overthinking it all. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm trying to do that but… 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Just being there with her husband sleeping completely. He was snoring on the chair. Completely comfortable and then her son sitting next to her at the couch and her just lying there being blissful and her son being there with her holding her hand and me just like blow drying her hair and like, like massaging herself again and stuff and like, she, she just keep saying, oh, this feels so good. You know, that stuff and it was really powerful to be able to do that for somebody. 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN I guess, I'm still a little bit nervous about doing the care. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Umm…because I feel like a little bit just not skilled in that. Everyone knows how to do it better than I do. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN I don't want to screw up. I don't want to put, umm…that person into discomfort because they are already in a lot of discomfort already. Umm…so I guess, it's just a little bit difficult for me. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN I'm getting better at it. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN All right. At that said when you ebb and flow there, you are on the same level. You're a human being coming and going and that's, that's amazing. The only difference comes of course when it becomes a family member and now we're talking about a whole different thing. That's a different level. All right. You're in your grandma's heart and she's in yours. That is a, that's nothing to do with position now with the adult, that's family. You know, but I think it brings it maybe richer, that you're able to have that and be able to do that. You know, and still be able to reach out to everybody else, and they to you. Let's hope. Keep doing what you're doing. You're making me very proud and, and blessed as a teacher. I really mean that from the bottom of my heart. Okay, go get some food. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Today is Thanksgiving. So the whole family is coming over. So I should be pretty crazy. 

00:40:10

00:40:35
UNKNOWN A couple of weeks ago, she wasn't feeling too good. And the doctors, they discovered a couple of masses in her brain. And they gave her the prognosis of two to three months but she, she sort of feels it was less. They started talking about hospice care and I immediately just called up, Betsy from the Shepherd Home and I asked her how to get my Grandma in because she had to be somewhere, I really wanted her to be where I was and the best place was with me and I knew that it's a wonderful place. And then, so she called my dad immediately. They began working things out. We moved her in last week and she so, she feels like a princess. And she loves having my sisters and I there. And it just… It really makes my Grandma happy because she loves young people. 

00:41:20
[music] 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN It, it did surprise me when all of a sudden, I get a call, saying hey, this is Betsy, we're at the shepherd home. Dillane(ph) just called me and told me what your situation is and we'd be happy to have your mother there. That's surprised me. It was just happened so fast. We were still in shock from finding out that she had terminal cancer and Dillane(ph), but she took care of everything, just took it out of our hands, put it into her hands and she, she took control. Dillane(ph) was able to stay with her everyday. The family was able to stay with her everyday and we're just very proud of Dillane(ph) for doing that. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN I originally was kind of, kind of weary about it. I was like uh…, I don't know if I want my friends to be here with my Grandma, you know, giving her showers or helping her with those kind of things, just sort of, I don't know, just some respect thing. But now, that I see like how my friends interacted with her, it's just so, it's amazing. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN I thought, it was gonna be very awkward because I, I didn't think, I would go talk to her about it. But like on Tuesday, when I came to school, the first thing Dillane(ph) said, I was like, I think my Grandma has a crush on you. And I just laughed out aloud. I'm like, you're probably right because I really… And I was like, I have a crush on your Grandma and we're just laughing about that the whole time. I mean, I thought it will be like very awkward, you know, it's like, your Grandma is dying, I'm sorry or something like that. But no, then she made me blush. I mean, her Grandma is just so lovely. 

00:43:20
[music] 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN I remember one time, I just leaned up next to her and I just want to go, I just want to go. She wasn't in any pain, but she was ready to go. And when the time came, she passed peacefully and, and that's the way she wanted to go. 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Charlie and I were at advent one evening. We just happen to be there together and we were there with umm…the resident Sherry, who, we got along with really well. We were sitting at the table and giggling and making her some dinner and, and then the conversation turned more towards her cancer. 

00:44:20
SHERRY I thought, you know, after being told that you had bad cancer and you probably won't gonna make it, that like I would become this, you know, I would become this little secret, you know. Like I would, I would kill, you know… What do I care you know, you know. All right, I'm gonna go bungee jumping, you know. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN That's really scary. 

00:44:40
SHERRY Umm…and I'm not gonna be scared of anything anymore. But you know what? Nothing changed. I'm still like huge scared again. I still go on roller coasters or… 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Through this experience, I have gathered an infinite number of tiny wisdoms that have been kind of sealed into me I think forever. And from, from this moment, from Sherry's moment with Charlie and I… What I got from it is that, she was trying to tell us that, things only outside won't, won't change who you, who you are, you are who you are and you have to kind of reconcile with yourself and realize that you are who you are and other people will love you for it and so you might as well love yourself for it too. 

00:45:40

00:45:45
[music] 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Kay was a Catholic nun and umm… I'm a Baptist Christian and, you know, even though those lines don't really crossed, umm… it didn't bother me saying, the catholic prayer with her or um… holding her rosaries and holding her hand. You know, it wasn't really above religions or stuff like that. It was more or less about being there and caring for a person and kind of, umm… kind of facing the fear of what we fear kind of because, you know, they're going onto the other side. Which is something that everyone just has questions about and some people have their answers too, but no one is actually answering those. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN Umm…so it was really snowy day and I was at Advent and umm…, I went into see how Harry was doing and he was getting to last stages, so um, I went in and I, you know, made sure he was comfortable. Put the covers on him and then umm…left him with his sister, so I could go be with Ada(ph) who was the other resident, who is in the main room. And I went out there and she was sitting in a wheelchair mesmerized by this amazing snowstorm. And umm…I just sat there and watched it with her. You know, she told me stories about places she's been and, you know, the animals she's seen and the people she met. And, you know, it's amazing to be there with her. Soon after I left Harry with her sister, he passed away and umm…I was with Ada watching the snow. It was in that moment that I realized, you know, what being in the moment really means. And it's not a huge thing, it's not, you know, this grandiose whatever um…but it's being there, umm…with people who need you. You know that is someone's mom, that is someone's best friend, that is someone's, you know, long, you know, life partner, you know, that's, that's everything to someone. You're, you are everything to someone. And I think that's made me realize that, you know, everyone has a part here. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Uh… Caroline is here. Okay, well, let's… Door is unlocked, we have two others that will be here. So we have some guests that you know. Okay, so this is Mitchell, Mitchell's mom Rosemary died at Advent House. This is John, who's father's name is John, died at the Shepherd Home. You folks, what to… Would you like to say to the student caregivers here? 

00:48:45
MITCHELL I do not know if I was asked to do that as a senior, senior. Umm… if I would have been able to say, yes to it. You gave us the opportunity to relinquish that role of caregiver. I don't know how, well, maybe you're care giving for dad but umm…and be their son and daughter again because you guys were there. So, you know, you're gonna be in my heart forever. 

00:49:10
JOHN Defiantly, I found out this morning that this is elective, you know, you guys chose to not only, you know, take the class and you know, that, you know, give your, you know, free time to help other people. I, I have to say, you know, I feel like you guys definitely, you know, made a great choice taking this class. I think, it will help all of you. You know, later in life. You know, and even now too. I'm sure you guys, you all have different outlook on life possibly after, you know, taking the class. It's one thing to take care of my dad, it's another thing for everyone there, you know, make me breakfast that, you know, that was, you know, some of the things you appreciate the most. I just didn't take care of my dad. They took care of all of us, you know. That's, that was the best thing. 

00:50:00
[music] 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I just got done with my shift at Shepherd Home. 

00:50:25
[music] 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Uh… Sunday. Umm… we only had Wendy. It was nice. Umm… didn't do much. The only thing that we really did was uh…the only thing that I really did was uh…put her socks on. She kept kicking them off. Umm…It's kind of funny. Every time you go to put them on, and so she likes smile. I just thought, it was kind of interesting like a simple thing like putting on socks would be enjoyable. Umm… it is fun. 

00:51:10
[music] 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN I'm going to college. I'm just gonna do my top choice. Wow! 

00:51:45
[music] 

00:52:05
[sil.] 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN So often I'll tell kids, don't buy into this uh…idea that you're too young, that you don't have uh… Not the ability. You, you don't have the strength. You don't have the… You don't have the chops to go out there yet to do this. You, you've got that, you know, you're weak. And the message must be the other way now. If we're to survive as human beings, we have to comeback to youth and we have to see, we have to empower youth with promise, risk and hope and then have the courage as adults to step back and trust in the fact that given the proper support, the love and the kindness, these young people can do anything. They can do anything. 

00:53:15
[music] 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Welcome. And this is our ceremony of remembrance. This is our tenth year of doing this and it is at these moments that we recall and celebrate relationships. Now, the moment has arrived. I defer to this year's hospice class to speak, to their own experience this year. And as they do so, it is very important for all of us to remember that this is indeed not a bereavement service, rather it's a celebration of love and compassion, which is inextricably rooted in remembrance. Love being the highest goal to which human beings can aspire. 

00:54:45
MADELINE Hi, I'm Madeline and I was in Mr. Kane's seventh period hospice class. Umm…I learnt more in hospice than about love and compassion and friendship than I probably learnt in the past 18 years of my life. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN When I signed up for hospice, I never really uh… I didn't know what I was getting into per say. I thought, it would be another class. I thought, I'd go there everyday. I go through it, go through emotions. Umm… uh…but didn't turn out being like that. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Life can be so easily taken away from us and I think that we don't, always think about that. And I think that it's something that we should think about more often, because it enables us to be present in the time and to, you know, enjoy what we have while we have still have it. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN One of favorite hospice experience is, was going out and smoking in the garage with a old lady. I wasn't smoking. But I come home at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, drenched in the smell of cigarette smoke. And I just thought like, how many teenagers can get away with it by saying, I smell like cigarette smoke because I was helping out hospice ladies. And my mom is like, oh, yeah, that's fine, honey, take a shower. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN It's difficult to talk about this stuff without slipping into clichés and naming that, itself is probably a cliché. But umm…I mean just, umm…just, you can, you can tell when you're, when you're caring for these people that they're just immensely thankful and, and that's wonderful. Umm…that's pretty much all I have to say. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN When you make a connection, it's not as hard as you might think. Even if the person is dying or if they are 6 or if they are 96, you can make connections every where. And that's why I'm so lucky to have taken this class. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN It's scary when you fall in love with the person and then they die. But it was worth it to fall in love with all these people.
