GERALD MONK It's my great pleasure to introduce to you Dr. Ken Gergen. A lot of you sitting here don't need to have Dr. Ken Gergen introduced to you. You know who Ken Gergen is, you know what he's contributed in his work alongside his dear life partner, Mary Gergen and colleagues, Sheila McNamee and many others that are here. But there are other people sitting in the audience who do not know very much about Dr. Ken Gergen. So I did a little bit of research about a few things I didn't know. The thing that stood out first was I calculated that I was 10 years old when Dr. Gergen started his professorship at Harvard University. Now you're supposed to laugh at that because we look about the same age, he was 12 and I was 10. And Mary and Ken's discipline is positive aging and so that's why we look in a similar stage of development. I'm originally from New Zealand and was a counselor educator with Dr. John Winslade and Mike Williams here at a time when New Zealand went through this really transformative challenging crazy time of people who were decolonizing; Maori, Pakeha, Polynesian. And we went through at times quite a tumultuous experience and sometimes we got stuck with our conversations and one of the places we got stuck were in identity politics. We started getting caught up in essentializing one another's backgrounds as though they were the other. And sometimes when we started down the road of identity politics despite the fact that identity politics has contributed a great deal to the planet in moving conversations forward and addressing all kinds of social injustice, some aspects of it tripped us up. And Ken spoke The Saturated Self which if you've not read that book, I know it came out in the late 1980s, 1991; is a book you must read because it's mindblowing in deconstructing psychology as a discipline that most of us understand. This whole notion that we have a unified self, some kind of stable self that's unchanging and that we evolve as one set of notions and that book took us places. It opened up conversations that we couldn't have had before and I just can't tell you how profound the work that Ken, Mary, and colleagues have done in creating a new language in psychology and it was really thrilling also to read that the American Psychological Association could honor your work and your contributions to the discipline of psychology in the award in 2007 that did so. So these ideas, the social constructionist ideas, you could look at them and go well, these are fancy theoretical interesting conceptional ideas; but Ken over many decades has not been interested only in conceptual and theoretical development, but has also been profoundly interested in working in the social fabric of society, working in the practical; on the streets, in communities. And this gathering of people, many of you are representative of those disciplines that have benefited from the work of Ken and Mary in the social constructionist realm. We have people in the organization of psychology, in the family therapy area, in education, in other academic contexts, and there are other disciplines I know right this second that I'm missing. Help me. What are some other disciplines? Organizational consultants; shout it out, what else do you do? Social work, there's a whole variety of disciplines; but it's the practical focus. And the last thing I want to say because I don't want to take any more time away from Ken being able to present some things to you. I moved to the United States and I joined a Marriage and Family Therapy Program at San Diego State University that now for 15 years has its foundational principles and guiding concepts in social constructionism. And the folks here, the MAF team, Marriage and Family Therapy people here, have benefited hugely in ways that you don't even know from the work of this gentleman that's on the stage. And so it's a great honor and a great thrill, Ken, and I know you're not feeling great and if I was feeling like Ken, I would be in bed asleep right now. But here he is to talk to you.

KENNETH GERGEN That's really generous, isn't it. I mean fantastic and I wish I were 10 with you now, we would play great. I'm a little bit odd I must tell you. It's partly just looking out here and partly just being part of this group because there are people here I've known from many many different contexts over many many different years and suddenly they're all in the same space and I don't want to be here. I want to be out at those tables, I want to be talking, I want to sit down with you, I want to hug you, I want to hear what's happening, I want to catch up, and I don't want to be just here talking away. So I'm sorry for that and I feel there's some -- it's like a kaleidoscope of your life and you feel like what a lucky life to have known people like yourselves, fantastic, fantastic. So thank you for being here. I also must say I'm a little bit overwhelmed at the program. I mean you people have put together this program that's an enormously rich array of topics and things that people are doing, practices and ideas that one comes tumbling out after the other and I hate you at the same time. I mean I know you feel the same way, what are you going to do? Be eight places at the same time, not going to happen. So what do we do? Well, first apologize, but maybe we can try to make up for it in our informal conversations and try to keep up with each other or an email or find some other ways because there's just so much good stuff here. I was also I must say a little bit overwhelmed at just the topics that I kind of felt I wanted to address and that was why social construction in the context of peacemaking or peacebuilding. I mean peacebuilding ideas and practices have been in motion for thousands of years and within the last 200 years enormous amount of writing; handbooks, digests, magazines, NGOs, and so on doing tremendous work on peacebuilding negotiation, conflict management, and so on and so on and so on, mediation and so on. It's enormous, you can't digest it. You just start a dissertation in that area right now and you try to do all the reading, you cannot get through it in a lifetime. So why social construction? Hasn't it all been said? Hasn't it all been done? Can you add much more than just a flippant to all of that? Well, I'm not so certain about that because there's a lot of brilliant work out there and a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with social construction and I am enormously impressed by it. So the challenge I set out for myself tonight was okay, what's added? What's the value-added piece that bringing in social construction as a set of ideas in that context of peacebuilding? And there were three things that struck me and thought of two big ideas, one I'll say right now and one just save to the end, and then some propositions I want to try out. And I think the upfront idea for me is that in some sense constructionism forms kind of a metatheoretical background, I'll figure that out in a minute, into which a lot of this work can be integrated. We'll begin to speak to each other and can begin to do some creative work across these various islands of activity and theory because most of that work that goes on in peacemaking context tends to be that people have small models that they work on, this is my particular model, this is my getting to yes and I use that and I'll use it everywhere I go or a particular mediation model which just fits right or a psychological model of needs and wants and desires and so on or it'll be one dimensional thing about identity or ten steps for reducing conflict in your organization. I mean these are all over the place. But there's no unifying front, there's no way of bringing them together, what do they say to each other, how could you use them together or how could they form a symphony which would say something larger or sing something larger. Well, constructionism seems to me to fit that bill of kind of a unifying orientation because after all what we're saying in a sense is that conflict is a condition of meaning, it's a condition of human meaning. It's how we've managed together to create worlds in which certain things have value and certain actions count as counter value and we do certain things when those things happen. That is we've orchestrated the world in which conflict has a place and in which we need peace and in which where all the pieces that we're dealing with have been borne in the nexus of human meaning making. And likewise whenever we talk about anything in terms of conflict reduction or management and so on, we are most often not necessarily always, most often dealing with processes of meaning making. How are we going to coordinate it differently? How could we talk? What could we say? It's a matter of communication and this is essentially the grounds of social construction. That's how we construct together, how we co-create other worlds, new meanings, and so on. So that you can take any particular model or form and you can begin to see it as you might say a language if you will. That is take for example just getting the formulation, we bargain about things. We'll take the highest common profit that we can both make out of this particular bargaining situation. Now that has its own ontology to it, that is it's a language. You will be one part or you'll be the other, these will be the payoffs, and so on, this will be the bargaining process and so on. It's like a language, but it's in the constructionist way only a one form of language, it's a way of co-creating a situation, it's a way of co-creating the actors in the situation, it's a way of co-creating what counts as a part of that outcome. And it's only if people are willing to play that game, join that language game that it will have any effect. So in some sense it's a language game with performances which in certain contexts may be effective. But if you can look at it that way, you can say well look, there are many many other kinds of games in the world that may have equal effects or be useful in other situations. I mean just take Buddhism for example. In the face of conflict, in the face of antagonism; meditate, you can deconstruct it all, gone. So it's another form of relating, it's another form of being in the world, a certain kind of language. Now what this allows you to do is begin to think well, what then we could in fact borrow or let's say we could amalgamate, bring together all these various kinds of languages and appreciate them for what they do and the context in which they may work. We can also begin to raise criticisms that is well, it doesn't seem to do this, it doesn't seem to do that. We can ask ourselves a bargaining, for example, what does it create. It creates antagonists. A lot of classical mediation creates antagonists. What does bargaining end up? You end up feeling okay well, I made the best deal out that I could, but you still end up as the other. Now that's not necessarily totally bad, but it's limited and I often talk with my Buddhist friends and well, what does the meditation get you after you've done it. Does compassion simply naturally come out into the world? I mean this a controversial case, but it raises the questions. Or if you can take any particular form of language and you can begin to ask well, under what conditions and for whom and for what groups and under what cases and is it possible that some languages will just simply recede in their potential because once they're known, once they're stated too often, they will lose their impact. I'll explain more about that later maybe. It allows you to be creative or invites creativity. Well, why not look at this as a kind of vocabulary then, look at all of this as a vocabulary to which we can add and then begin to take pieces of it. What do I need in this situation in the same way we talk? What do we do? We take pieces of vocabulary off the shelf from various traditions in which we've been involved and we simply put them together, just hang them on together and hammer them together for wherever we are in the same way you can take vocabularies of peacebuilding. Well, how does that work? Oh, he does it this way and that seems to have a really good effect; why don't we take that piece and make it part of our piece and see how that goes. This is an enormous invitation here then to mix the vocabularies, generate new amalgams, new possibilities, new ways of talking. So to me that furnished at least a backdrop for understanding the way in which social construction does something that I don't think has been done before. There was another sort of nagging set of questions that are beginning to occur to me and that is well okay, let's be more specific about things. Where does it sort of hurt? And look Gerald, it's not been totally a good life for me, a lot of people do not like these ideas, constructionists. I mean I'd say I spent most of my life embattled as opposed to appreciated. I suspect for any of you who've done the constructionist ideas too, most people want to hold on to their realities pretty tightly. So I said okay, because where it hurts, you can make constructionist statements so that you feel them a little bit, then you'll know you've got some interesting opening that may bring some kind of illumination that wasn't there before. So I made some provocative propositions. Thank you, they are. Now for some of you these may not seem provocative, you've been around long enough. For others of you who some of you are new, they are going to sound a little strange. I thought of one point because I wasn't feeling real well that I'd give you these propositions and you work out the implications, but I'll see if I can hold strong for a bit and see what happens. Okay. Number one, there's no conflict, no peace, no suffering, no conflicted people in the world. Is that reasonable? That should be an easy one, right. I mean that's kind of the first rule of constructionism. Whatever there is isn't read off the world, whatever we say is real or true is not there to be read or copied. That is the saying is not a map of whatever's the case. Put another way, the discourse it is in the saying, it is in the discourse that that which comes into being for what it is for us. So there aren't any -- people know this in an instant, there are no problems to create conflict with that are just there lying on the pavement, in the closet, or in the countryside. There are no problems worth having a conflict about until you begin to understand them as problems, until you being to create or construct them in that way. There's no antagonism until you construct the world in a way that that's what should happen, that's what I feel, that's the way I feel, that's what you being in the case there's no good or evil to fight against as in conflict until you create something as good or evil. There's no power to overcome or oppression to overcome unless you construct the world as oppressive and powerful. There's no suffering unless you construct it as suffering. I mean you can have the same method. I think now this gentleman played a little bit, you're a rugby player, right? 

00:21:30
 Long time ago. 

00:21:30
KENNETH GERGEN Long time ago. Well, I used to have a rugby friend who reminded me of you and I'd see this guy in the afternoon come home after a rugby match and that guy would be black and blue like scars, blood, like he'd be like almost limping and say fantastic afternoon. I mean it was like part of what there was to do. Most of us with one blow like that we'd probably spend the rest of the day in bed. So the blow was not the blow, it depends on the meaning in which we give to it. Now as awful as that sounds, there's a sense in which it's enormously liberating. As we all live in those realities, there's no sort of doubting those when we're in them and they're very hard to suspend as I'm suggesting. But this is to say if you press hard enough, if you got the right conditions, if you got the right people, if you got the right way of talking, all of it is furniture on the move. All of it is a possibility for being otherwise. All of it is up for reconstruction, reworking, reframing in another way. And of course, a lot of you know this from your practice. I mean this is AI right from the start, you don't have to start with a problem and solve the problem, begin to talk about something you appreciate and by and large often the problem simply dissolves itself not always, but very often it just what problem. We're not there, we're not in that space anymore. That's not the way we look at the world. We'll look at narrative mediation. I mean the very way of just doing externalization. The problem's not there, let's look at the problem as between you, it's out there. Let's the two of us look at that and see how we can fight or combat that problem. I mean it's a whole reframing or reconstructing, it's not me versus you, it's me versus you as an out there thing which we can both deal with. I mean that's a real shift, it is an anti-realist shift. It allows you enormous possibilities for thinking otherwise, for recreating, reconstructing in different ways. Okay. You're going to hate me for most of these I think. Conflict is not a failure of some kind, not an anomaly or a malfunctioning in some system or the person. On the contrary, it's the result of a flourishing. Alright, now realize I'm going to make real conflict at this point. I'm going to shift out of that basic constructionist premise where it can be anything so I'm going to borrow the common vernacular here. But here would be one framing of conflict, how it originates from a constructionist standpoint; not the only one, but one which is very helpful. And that is to say whenever people get together or let's imagine this for example yourselves here. You don't come intrinsically together to create any kind of conflict and so you're all pretty open to each other. And if you sat down at those tables long enough and tried to work on a given problem let's say or case study, you could develop a pretty strong sense of what that case study was about and what you should about it and for you that would become absolutely clear that maybe the only thing you could do about it because as you talk about it, you will begin to develop a rationale, you'll begin to generate other ways of layering that rationale with data, with facts, with supporting evidence so that it becomes totally clear. Now that's a flourishing, that's a co-creation with an enormous potential, but there will be different co-creations from different tables and if we laid money on it about which was the really real, which was the best; we'd start to have conflict or if we put you in a jury room and it was a matter of guilt or innocence and you're on different sides of the case, you will come out with different views strongly held, absolutely must be the case. In a sense then conflict is a result of a flourishing, different kind of realities coming together and we should honor the development of those realities, enormously important, we couldn't live without them. They nurture us every day. We live with those in ways that we trust someone, rely on them, and they are everything to us. But now we got a case where there are multiplicities and often that not only ends up to being some kind of conflict, but what if we didn't look at it as conflict, what if we looked at it as not an either/or and this will be no news to most of you, but as different perspectives which in fact might be illuminating for us to listen to. I'll just give you one case. I mean I've been part of the human sciences, that's social science, the science of the enlightened movement for most of my adulthood. Science by and large has been set against religious institutions, some invading the halls of science. I mean there's science about facts as a religion it's about mythology, keep it out of the schools, keep it out of the universities. Let's keep it pure, let's make it like we need knowledge here and not make believe. Now if you look this in terms of constructionism, you don't ask that question, again to go back to the beginning like two vocabularies. Their perspectives, their way of looking at the things, the ways of generating realities about the way we live and science in that respect is no more real, no more objective, no more true than religion if it means having a set of words which are a map of the way things are. It's just another way and it has certain kinds of outcomes if you adopt that way, certain things happen and most of them I think probably we would accept. That doesn't mean abandoning somehow or undermining religion or spiritual belief, it's just another way of looking at the world, but asking what does it do; what happens when we go into those worlds, what happens when we accept the reality of the spirit of some kind. What kind of life do we lead? And there are certain ways in which those kinds of lives that come out of a spiritual discourse or do things that science can do and vice versa. So it's to say when you've got potential conflict, know this is wrong or you're wrong, it's an opportunity to explore what the other must be thinking. What do they get from that? Where are they in those ideas? What can I get from them? I'm thinking here also of a method of deep democracy is one of the peacebuilding ideas that plays around. And deep democracy, you have sides on given issues; but when you got negatives, you don't just vote them down and that is okay, we've got the majority, that's it, let's just get on with it and live with it. What they do is to stop the process and ask you to make special arrangements for you to listen to the people who are on the other side, go into the negatives, find a -- sort of inhabit that reality, see what it's like. If you're going to have it, would you make the same vote? Would we do something different? Would we somehow have another outcome? It's just another move to make. By the way I'm not saying either that this is -- any of this is easy, that it's easy to suspend a reality in which one finds oneself or that it's easy to be curious about those with whom we disagree. I mean the last three elections, I've had to do a lot of soul searching because I found myself unable in the case of at least two of those elections to even have a conversation with people on the other side and even in the last one, it's been difficult because I already know what's right and I'm pretty sure of it and everybody I know agrees with me. I don't know anybody on the other side and then I think that's not good, that's not good. Okay. Three, when we're engaged in a hostile conflict, dialog is not necessarily helpful nor is understanding the other. Here I'm trying to point out that if we have a conflict together; husband and wife, let's say people who are adjudicating or something; it's not necessarily helpful to simply say let's have a talk, we have to sit down and talk about this. The husband and wife is the easiest one. Let's have a talk about this. Well, what is talk? What is dialog? It's as if we already know what that is wherein we already have that skill, everybody knows how to talk, everybody knows how to work out the differences, but they don't. The kind of dialog that we're dealing with in this room is a kind of rare one, it's a special sorts of skills we're talking about here. We're trying to fashion those skills, we're trying to create new ways going on in which those skills can be manifest. So it's in some sense to say it's not helpful just to have a dialog. I mean I think back now in the town meetings that Obama held about healthcare if you remember those, we're going to have town meetings and discuss these in rational ways and well exploded, just shouting people and angry people. So the dialog doesn't help, it's like having to craft special ways of talking within our histories that allow us to move in ways that are not just obvious and logical. So this room becomes then filled with creators of possibilities. Now I think like public conversations for example. I mean that's not just a technique that was made up and a few people use. In some sense that's a cultural invention, it's like inventing electric powered car, it's like a way to be with other people which has never been there before exactly like that. So the room becomes full of inventors of those kinds of crafts which can create the future. Alright. Personal emotions are not the source of any conflict and again, I'm crawling inside the reality of emotions. I mean we often say well, we're angry or we're infuriated so we do something and then that's really crucial to how conflict works. But from a constructionist standpoint, you can begin to see you can denaturalize emotions as why accept emotions as something that's biological and necessary in let's say cases where you're being oppressed, you just naturally explode. Look at emotions as cultural constructions, they are ways -- forms of action with other people. We know how to do them and we know when to do them when they're in the sense appropriate so you can't just explode in anger at injustice anywhere on the street, you can only do it in certain places when certain things that people would agree were unjust could not have happened. That is the construction of injustice. Allows you given that construction, I'm into my anger and resistance, now we got conflict and nothing follows from that. That is nothing follows as a necessary consequence of that, you don't have to do anything as a result of another person's anger. Now I'm starting to collapse two different categories in here. That is to say that kind of resistance to what we'll call oppression is part of a cultural dance. We affirm it, we like it, in some sense it's very American. We borrowed it from the French in some way. So it's like playing a scenario, it's like a dance in which oppression, power, injustice; we'll fight that, we'll resist that and we'll do something and we'll do it in the name of heroics, why not? Well, it just happens if you look on death row, people who are going to be executed for taking the life of another, and you listen to the narrative stories of those people who are on death row. About 60% of them are people who were righting injustices, something happened, someone did something that was wrong in their terms. You come up, you're flirting with a girlfriend, you say lay off my girlfriend, that's my girlfriend. The person says well, something something I won't repeat, you get a little bit more hostile and pretty soon you've cracked him in the head with a bottle and you have done it for the name of justice and right. So it's to say then and to go back to the earlier case, we play in these scenarios and I love the oppression injustice resistance, I've written about it. I stood in the trenches and fought this and that and the other wars, fantastic in terms of feeling really good about yourself and worthwhile, but it's a dangerous dance. It's a really dangerous dance so say well okay, that is a dance we could play, but we don't have to. You'll love it when you're in it, but you don't have to, could you do otherwise and here again we go back to use the creators of the otherwise. For everything we believe, we champion, we support, we also hold the opposite. If you can conceive of ourselves as carrying with us an array of relationships that is in the same way that all the words I'm using have come out of relationships and they've come out of different relationships. So I'm just mixing vocabularies, some multiplicities of relationships and there are others as well that just won't get out in front here or which just are irrelevant, but which are there so there's this kind of multibeing which we occupy and within that space of multibeing, we carry by and large whole sets of opposition moves, oppositions which dwell there. So that virtually for anything we do if you really stop to think about it hard enough and all the ways you shouldn't be doing that, you wouldn't be here. As you got the rationale carrying around in there, which said wow, this is the last place I ought to be right now, I mean you could do it. Sitting at the table you could do it, you can bid yourself let's leave because they're all there and that includes the rationale of everyone you're against. As you argue with somebody, let's take the abortion debate for example or gay marriage, whatever. You're in that debate, you know the opposition's lines, you could say them, you could perform them, you could probably be set up in a place where you could perform them so passionately that you would have to believe well, there's something to that. So it's all there. Now that's not a shortcoming in the sense because what that does is to open up a space where the other is already you in a sense where the antagonism is in some sense situated because you actually have some of the other with you that could be part of this. By the way, one of the long-term reasonings in conflict work as you all know is where you find some commonality and you can find that commonality because you got multiplicities. But that's only one thing because you're going to always find some part of you which is the other already or let's say in public conversations terms, the gray areas. That part which actually isn't there and actually sounds a little bit like the other. Okay. I could go on with those and I've taken too much time and I'm sorry about that, but I've got to at last finish off with one piece which is important to me because I think that there's a lot of idealism in this room. I know most of us are here, lot of things we really hold dear, a sense that we somehow could make some contribution the world will call better. I mean certainly there within me somewhere it embarrasses me sometimes, but I don't think I would be doing very much without it. So what is an idealism for me at least in constructionist terms, it's like the feeling that somehow if we lived in a world where we could all be parts of traditions in the making which we loved and were nurtured and cherished by and realize that there are multiplicities but honor the ones that we're in. But at the same time do so and this is the hard part where the reflexive moment or reflexive consciousness that that's historically culturally temporarily situated. That it's one way and it's perhaps not going to be that way for a long time that it's there but you're not totally there. There's always one piece that's got that opening so that you remove the kind of search for certainty, the way, the word, the truth. That's somehow a finalization written in stone and you look at everything as somewhat open, somewhat could be changed, could be otherwise. And I think you have -- Leonard Cohen piece Anthem, many of you know this. It's a wonderful piece with some wonderful lines and sounds something like this. Let all the bells that can ring -- let's ring all the bells that can ring, forget the perfect offering, there's a crack in everything, and that's where the light gets in. And it's that light and that consciousness that somehow if we'll always have that opening, always that space that we could be part of a continuous process which always takes the others involved in the co-creation which always honors that space, cherishes that space of the continuation of meaning making so it never gets closed off so that it always has the next move, the next person, the next word which can become then and is always enchanged. And in some sense I think that's what all of you are about. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
