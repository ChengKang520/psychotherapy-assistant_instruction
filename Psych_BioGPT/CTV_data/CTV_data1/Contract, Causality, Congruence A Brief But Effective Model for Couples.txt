Contract, Causality, Congruence: 

00:00:35
A Brief but Effective Model for 

00:00:35
Couples 

00:00:35
Pat Love, EdD 

00:00:35
PAT LOVE Okay, good morning. Who here -- who here's from the -- anybody here from the West Coast, I’m amazed any would be up this early, especially from the West Coast. How many from the East Coast? Yeah, wow! Well, welcome. I’m Pat Love and I’m here to do a clinical demonstration and, um, let me just tell you a short bit about my work and then we need volunteers actually. Ideally, I would have a couple and ideally I would have a couple who really has a real issue because my -- 99% of my practice is couples and uh -- and the other 1% are individuals talking about being a couple. So that’s-that's, you know, talking about relationships. And through the 30 years that I’ve been practicing I’ve come up with simple little model and the model is just the three steps I use when I work with anybody, individual or couples. And its -- I call it contract, causality, and congruence. Those are sort of fancy words but they're pretty simple concepts. And the contract means when anybody comes in, I just simply say how can I help? Now I’m a quintessential brief therapist because overwhelmingly the number of times I see a couple is one, one time. However most couples come for a full day and a half. And I see one couple all day for a day or two days sometimes three days running and then they go home. Um, most of my couples are therapist referred and they go either go back to a therapist or not. Um, I call myself a consultant instead of a therapist, because I really see myself as directing and trying to address the issue in-in one consult. I laughingly say this but it's really true, I say the difference between consulting as therapy is you charge more money and just tell him what to do. I'm -- in some ways I feel like I’m too old to do therapy so I do consulting. The older I’ve gotten the more I act like a consultant. Um, so contract is how can I help. I try to get them to specific and I -- and then number two, I try to see how they are part of the cause of not getting what they say they want and I watch for that in the session. And then number three congruence, I try to give them what they say they want and my theory is that most of us resist that which we want that we resist the most, that which we need the most that we get in our own way. So in therapy, I have a working hypothesis that if partner A says, I want my partner sitting across from me to be more loving that somehow partner A is part of the issue in preventing and making it difficult for partner B to be more loving. That's part of the theory. And part of-- and the rest of the theory is that when the loving behavior shows up that there may -- partner A maybe defended against seeing it or somehow resist it. So I wanna be there to create safety and call their attention to the congruence of the contract, which is this is your partner loving you and your job is to take that in, because I think most people -- while most people think the challenges to get somebody to love me I say the courage, the big challenge in relationships is often, do I have the courage to let somebody love me? So that’s just sort of the theory in a nutshell. Knowing there are exceptions to that, but I would love to demonstrate this if we have a couple, two people, who are -- who would like to come up and be a couple and let me work with you for 45, 50 minutes see what that -- see how that unwinds and um, so just let me ask, is there a couple who could come up and be a volunteer? Oh great! I have a couple come on up. Great, we have some little release forms if you'll sign? Thank you, thank you. Come on up. We have the forms here if you'll just come on up and sign. 

00:05:45
[sil.] 

00:06:30
PAT LOVE At the end we’ll have a little time for some questions and if you have a question, if you would go to the mike that really helps with the recording. So, oh thank you so much. This is great. 

00:06:45
[sil.] 

00:06:50
PAT LOVE I know, the-the -- it goes over your ear. That's right, lemme see, er.. I think its -- is that working? This little earpiece thing goes over your ear, yeah. Spoiling any hope of a hair do, yeah. I think it's the other -- I think that mike goes on the -- yes, that’s it. 

00:07:20
JOEL Does that work for me? 

00:07:20
PAT LOVE Let me see if I can help. This is it. This right here goes over your ear you can feel it and yours it just get clipped. 

00:07:30
JOEL Yeah. 

00:07:30
PAT LOVE So tell me for the sake of the video here, tell us what to call you? 

00:07:40
ROBIN Robin. 

00:07:40
PAT LOVE Robin. 

00:07:40
JOEL Joel. 

00:07:40
PAT LOVE Joel. Pleasure to meet you again. 

00:07:45
ROBIN Thank you. 

00:07:45
PAT LOVE Yes. So, um, we have about, you know, 45 minutes, um, if you left here thinking, "Wow! I’m so glad we did that", and then sort of in line with me saying how can I help? Or um, what would you -- what would make this feel like "Wow yeah, I’m really glad I did it". That -- what could be different? 

00:08:15
ROBIN Uh, for me it would be, if we would have much more pleasant mornings. 

00:08:20
PAT LOVE Okay. So you would have much more pleasant mornings. So I’m thinking maybe this morning as well as at home. 

00:08:30
ROBIN No. 

00:08:30
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:08:30
ROBIN This was a wonderful morning. This wasn’t our normal routine. 

00:08:35
PAT LOVE Oh! Okay, okay. 

00:08:35
JOEL Well, we're not going out to work basically. You know, we're just waking up knowing that we have a day ahead of us that is pleasurable, we predict it to be pleasurable. 

00:08:45
PAT LOVE Okay. So much more pleasant -- that you would have much more pleasant mornings. 

00:08:50
ROBIN Right. 

00:08:50
PAT LOVE And I’m -- I'm sort of thinking maybe a vision of that or an experience of that or a plan for that is that... 

00:09:00
ROBIN Is that what I’m thinking? 

00:09:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:09:00
ROBIN Well, truly I’m thinking you're gonna help him. 

00:09:05
PAT LOVE It's an honest woman. 

00:09:10
ROBIN To understand- 

00:09:10
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:09:15
ROBIN What-what I’m saying. 

00:09:15
PAT LOVE Okay. Oh! Okay, to sorta get what you mean by much more pleasant morning. 

00:09:20
ROBIN Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:20
PAT LOVE Okay, okay. So maybe if you left here and he got it, he really got it, "Oh that’s what you mean by much more pleasant morning. 

00:09:30
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:09:30
PAT LOVE Okay that’s helpful. What about you Joel? If you left here and you felt like I’m really glad we did that, what could be different? 

00:09:40
JOEL Not considering the morning necessarily. 

00:09:40
PAT LOVE Anything, anything. 

00:09:45
JOEL Okay. 

00:09:45
PAT LOVE You don’t have to have the same one. 

00:09:45
JOEL Yeah. So basically, um, when I speak about a problem that I’m not confronted with a solution to the problem more recognized that I have a problem and that, um, I-I’ll solve it some how, you know, but not directed. 

00:10:05
PAT LOVE Okay.(crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JOEL not told -- not told. 

00:10:10
PAT LOVE Okay.(crosstalk) 

00:10:10
JOEL how its gonna unfold and how it’s gonna be solved. 

00:10:15
PAT LOVE Okay. What would you like Robin to do instead of direct or tol-tell you? What would you like her to do instead when you present her with a problem? 

00:10:25
JOEL Listen to me, recognize the problem that I’m saying and uh, just basically give me feelings, you know, through our conversation that uh, make me feel that she heard me and that the problem -- that I’ll handle it whatever it is in a confident way. 

00:10:45
PAT LOVE Okay. So -- so to hear you and to also hear the feelings it sounded like. Tell me more about the feelings? 

00:10:55
JOEL Well giving me the power rather than presenting her idea of the power I think would give me the feelings that I will I'd be able to address the problem in my own way, I probably confronted the problem before. 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:11:10
JOEL In similar ways and uh- 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE Okay.(crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOEL I’d be able to move ahead in- 

00:11:10
PAT LOVE Okay.(crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOEL  that respect. 

00:11:15
PAT LOVE Okay, okay. 

00:11:15
ROBIN Sounds like he is asking for a little more encouragement and probably I am not that encouraging. 

00:11:20
PAT LOVE Is that correct? Would you like her to encourage you? 

00:11:25
JOEL Absolutely an-and listen to me more than direct me. 

00:11:30
PAT LOVE Okay. Okay. 

00:11:30
JOEL I mean when someone -- when you say something and someone starts directing you- 

00:11:30
PAT LOVE Yea.(crosstalk) 

00:11:30
JOEL  You know I maintain that I go to a therapist just to have- just to have somebody really listen to me. 

00:11:40
PAT LOVE Oh wow! Okay. So you are... 

00:11:40
ROBIN And I maintain his therapist from working very well. 

00:11:50
PAT LOVE So you're asking for listening for him to understand to listen and understand what I mean by a more pleasant morning. You're asking for listening and understanding. It sounds to me like I would like Robin to listen and just be there and know that I’ve -- I've confronted this before, I’ll solve it but to be more encouraging by listening and keeping the almost locus of control over here and not over here. 

00:12:20
JOEL That’s true. That's true. 

00:12:25
PAT LOVE Okay. Okay, so it sounds in someway similar and -- 'cos y'all might be like what research says all therapists even those of us who teach communication, when we go home we don’t do it. That’s what research says, we're not very good about doing it. However, I-I can show y'all a skill and so that’s what I’m thinking I might like to do, because it's probably something you've taught other people you’ve seen it but-but if you did it the way I’m gonna teach it to you, y’all will take home something precious. 

00:13:00
ROBIN Thank you. 

00:13:00
PAT LOVE And see that’s -- that's what I -- 'cos-cos sitting here looking at the two of you, I get-I get- I-I get a good sense of why y'all are together, I get a good sense of it. Yeah, why are y'all together? That’s a good question. Yeah, why this women? Why this women? 

00:13:20
JOEL Well, this woman has been my friend for many years. Uh, she's always been truthful, always been loyal, always been dedicated. We tend not to agree as we get older on so much, but I, um, I had to get stronger really to hold my ground, um, but I-I trust this women, you know, to the utmost. 

00:13:45
PAT LOVE You just tell her. Yeah. 

00:13:45
JOEL Yeah, I trust her and I love her and you know I-I'm I feel good being near her and even though I might not, you know, wanted some of the advice, she's given me tons of advice through the years. That of I've accepted. 

00:14:05
ROBIN You're welcome. 

00:14:10
PAT LOVE Yea, okay. Okay, what about why this guy? Just tell him. You, yeah. 

00:14:15
ROBIN Okay, well-well actually I always say that Joel practically saved my life and I'm gonna start crying, but I came from a pretty dysfunctional family and he came into my life when we were in middle school and, uh, he showed what love was and I loved him and he loved me very, very young and I’m so grateful 'cos I don’t know what would happen without real love in my life coming from my dysfunctional family, so I love him. I just love him. 

00:14:50
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:50
JOEL Thank you dear. 

00:14:55
PAT LOVE Yeah. I think that must have been what I saw. 

00:15:00
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:15:00
PAT LOVE When I saw both of your faces coming this way. 

00:15:00
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:15:00
PAT LOVE And that’s the part we wanna protect. You know? We wanna protect that preciousness. And, uh, so how can we -- what -- as you look at Joel and you tell the story and I see the look on your face, so what’s goes on inside of you right-right this minute as you feel this love that this man has given you for so many years? 

00:15:30
ROBIN Well, I think of how wonderful and how awesome it is to have love in your life, that to wake up every morning with complaint about something is such a waste of time and energy. 

00:15:40
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:15:40
ROBIN  And it weighs on me because I love him and I hate that he feels that way and half the things aren’t even -- they're not to me that big a deal, they change and he handles and you know, you know, a simple silly example would be like we go to bed pretty early and, um, if -- lets say we went to bed at nine and he gets up at like four in the morning, he will complain about how he got up so early and I will think, "Gosh! We went to bed so early, you really got a lot of sleep like are you tired?" And he's not really tired but he just wanted to be in bed till six. 

00:16:25
PAT LOVE Yeah. So what would you -- so one of the things in your more pleasant morning would be instead of complaining we would what? 

00:16:35
ROBIN Be grateful. 

00:16:40
PAT LOVE So wake up with gratitude. 

00:16:40
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:16:40
PAT LOVE Okay. And would that be words, would that be, you know, a smile, would it be a touch, what would it be? 

00:16:50
ROBIN It could be any of those or even a joke or a tease. It could be anything. 

00:16:55
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:16:55
ROBIN Not a lot because we are kind of quiet in the morning, but just not heavy and negative. 

00:17:00
PAT LOVE Okay. So instead of heavy and negative that you wake up with gratitude and some -- some semblance of gratitude that the first thing in the morning that when the first person wakes up that he or she initiates gratitude that it would be in someway. And by the way, what I often recommend is the very first thing -- who does wake first by the way? 

00:17:25
JOEL Me usually. 

00:17:30
ROBIN Joel. 

00:17:30
PAT LOVE Usually. What I recommend for couples is the very first person that wakes up you make SOS, skin on skin contact. You just -- you don’t have to say a word. The skin on skin contact starts the flow of oxytocin, it's that bonding move toward neurochemical, it’s a simple act it can be a kiss it can be a touch, but it has be skin on skin. 

00:17:55
ROBIN Well, can I say something about that. 

00:17:55
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:17:55
ROBIN Because it's so interesting, I would love that. But he would probably not love that because he is very sensitive to disturbing me, which I’ll say he... 

00:18:05
PAT LOVE (crosstalk)I’m gonna stop you 'cos I'm gonna -- I’m just gonna throw out something so that you get to choose -- you get to choose what you might like to do, okay. 

00:18:15
JOEL That’s a good idea. 

00:18:15
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah, yeah. You get to choose. 

00:18:15
ROBIN (crosstalk)Right. You right. 

00:18:15
PAT LOVE So we will get you not to choose for him- 

00:18:20
ROBIN (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:18:20
PAT LOVE you know, 'cos he might choose that 

00:18:20
ROBIN Okay. 

00:18:20
PAT LOVE -- he might choose that I’m just gonna throw it out. 

00:18:25
ROBIN Okay. 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:25
ROBIN Sounds fun. 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE So that you get choose what you like to do you know? So what you – here's the first request is that I might think in the morning that we begin our morning with gratitude, it could be a word, it could be a smile, it could be -- 'cos y'all have great eye contact. I mean you -- you are so present – I mean, I-I don’t know if people tell you that you do have such presence, which is such a gift and you have it and I see when y'all where looking at me I really could see how present you are. So that’s a great gift that attunement is what we long for and I’m curious how much time y'all have when you're not talking but -- and you're tuned into each other yeah, 'cos that’s an interesting. 

00:19:20
JOEL In the morning or? 

00:19:20
PAT LOVE Anytime, anytime that's just... 

00:19:25
ROBIN Not morning. 

00:19:25
PAT LOVE This is just something on the menu because you're both -- this is -- this is a strength I think you both have that I would love to see you, I’m just throwing out things on the menu y'all get to choose. 

00:19:35
JOEL Okay. 

00:19:35
PAT LOVE You get to choose what to do, you get to choose what to do. And all of this could make for a more pleasant morning. 

00:19:40
ROBIN Right. 

00:19:40
PAT LOVE  It also could make for a listening, you know, a deep listening because when you're talking of course you are not listening- 

00:19:50
JOEL Right. 

00:19:50
PAT LOVE You know you're not listening and, uh, but also, when you're even thinking other thoughts in your mind like multitasking- 

00:20:00
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:20:00
PAT LOVE -you're not making that connection- 

00:20:05
ROBIN True. 

00:20:05
PAT LOVE 'cos my hunch is y'all want the ideal, if you start your morning in a good connected place. First of all that’s gonna calm you. 

00:20:10
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:20:10
PAT LOVE You know, so you so you don’t feel like over functioning or micro-managing or ordering and directing whatever, 'cos that comes -- my hunch is that comes from wanting to help. 

00:20:25
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:20:25
PAT LOVE And also from some anxiety that might get created. 

00:20:30
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE You know that’s what usually what that is. 

00:20:30
ROBIN True. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE So as y'all -- so one of the ways you could start your morning and I'm just gonna throw this out and y'all think about it, if this would be you first of all, if it would -- if we move the ball forward and in y'all's relationship, okay? So number one, whomever wakes up first skin on skin contact, whomever wakes up first and I would say both of you at some point you express gratitude that’s another one. The third thing you could is just appreciate each other in silence. Because you're so present in fact, I’m gonna -- you were doing it earlier when y'all looked at each other, if you just could sort of look and think, I’m gonna get you to think grateful thoughts about one and another as you look. 

00:21:15
[sil.] 

00:21:25
PAT LOVE And see 'cos you have the ability – this is a great ability especially for men to use soft eyes. You know for women, gazing increases oxytocin, just looking in her eyes you can see her eyes moisten just from that. 

00:21:40
JOEL Mhm. 

00:21:40
PAT LOVE You know, you touched her just from that short moment. 

00:21:45
JOEL Yea. 

00:21:45
PAT LOVE For men, you have to be little careful because if you don’t have soft eyes its more an act of aggression, okay? 

00:21:50
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:21:50
PAT LOVE So -- but you have these wonderful eyes that have the ability to -- you have good soft eyes- 

00:21:55
JOEL Mm-hmm.(Crostalk) 

00:21:55
PAT LOVE you know? And so that and -- which would be very good for you- 

00:22:00
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:22:00
PAT LOVE And just that soft eye glance just for, you know, three or four seconds like y'all did it is such an act of gratitude, 'cos y'all have -- how many years you all have been together? 

00:22:15
ROBIN 40 something. 

00:22:15
PAT LOVE I mean you have so many years to be – for which to be grateful. And you were saying we loved each other at such a young age, I love the way you put that. So all of this can be acknowledging it, it doesn’t have to be talking. You know, and it doesn’t -- you can wake up and say I’m so glad you're here or whatever is gratitude, you know, in the morning, but the touching that’s another option. Now the thing you both said and I wanna -- 'cos I wanna give you what you say you want, I want to give you an experience and you may have done this, it's very simple, it's very classic, but I like you to, um, at first just give a couple of short sentences to Joel about how – what a more pleasurable morning – if we had -- when we have a pleasurable morning what it does for me is, tell him what it does for you, just tell it. And then I'm gonna get -- and I want you to give him short sentences so you could just say it back exactly like she said it, actually word for word. You sorta change the pronouns a little if she says "I love it when you bring me coffee", you say, "You love it when I bring you coffee". All you do is change. And you are gonna make it short so he can say it and-and-and you're gonna even try to match her tone and her pace. So tell, you know, a more pleasurable morning what it does me is and he is going to mirror you back. 

00:23:50
ROBIN Okay, so for me a more pleasurable morning gives me a, um, a greater opened hearted feeling for you. 

00:24:05
JOEL A more pleasurable morning for you makes you feel warmer towards me. 

00:24:10
ROBIN Mhm. 

00:24:10
PAT LOVE Just give him that little piece again. Say it again make it shorter. 

00:24:15
ROBIN Having a um, more pleasurabl-pleasurable morning for me leaves me with you, I can't tell it short, in my heart for the whole day. 

00:24:35
JOEL When you have a more pleasurable morning with me, your heart is more open and feels better for me. 

00:24:45
PAT LOVE With you all day. 

00:24:45
JOEL With me in it all day. 

00:24:50
PAT LOVE And when my heart is open for you I – just short. 

00:24:55
ROBIN When my heart is open for you I -- I sore. 

00:25:05
JOEL When your heart is open for me you sore, you feel great. Get through things great. 

00:25:10
PAT LOVE Okay, and I’m gonna get you just to say her words, just but exactly. 

00:25:15
JOEL Okay. 

00:25:15
PAT LOVE Okay. Um, and if my heart stayed open for a long time what I think I might or to do for you? 

00:25:35
ROBIN I think if my heart stayed open I might -- I might be able to -- I might be able to trust you’ll have your own solutions and I won’t have such a need to help you. 

00:25:55
PAT LOVE Hmm, interesting. 

00:26:00
JOEL If your heart stayed open you would trust me making my own solutions and you wouldn’t have to help me. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:15
ROBIN And to probably then I would actually be more encouraging. Sorta like a vicious cycle we have going on here. 

00:26:30
PAT LOVE Just say that back. And probably you’d be more encouraging. 

00:26:35
JOEL And so you'd probably be more encouraging to me. 

00:26:40
ROBIN Mm-hmm. Would you like that? 

00:26:45
JOEL I would like that. Certainly I'd like that. 

00:26:50
ROBIN See I almost felt a little negativity there. 

00:26:50
PAT LOVE Okay, all-all you can do is mirror. 

00:26:55
ROBIN Okay. 

00:26:55
PAT LOVE If she -- okay, I’m gonna -- I'm gonna hold you for a moment. 

00:27:00
ROBIN Okay. 

00:27:00
PAT LOVE Okay? Because a next step and this is sort of an advanced step but that makes sense because when your heart is open, see if this fits, when your heart is open you relax. 

00:27:20
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:20
PAT LOVE And when you relax you can listen. 

00:27:25
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
PAT LOVE And you don’t have to tell me what to do. 

00:27:25
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:27:25
PAT LOVE When you relax, is it? 

00:27:30
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:27:30
PAT LOVE And I can imagine. 

00:27:30
ROBIN Because I get anxious. 

00:27:30
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. 

00:27:30
ROBIN (crosstalk)I feel bad for him, I get worried, I get fearful. 

00:27:35
PAT LOVE (crosstalk)Yes, you get fearful and then you wanna help. 

00:27:40
ROBIN Right. 

00:27:40
PAT LOVE You wanna help and so you extend the help. 

00:27:40
ROBIN Right. 

00:27:40
PAT LOVE  And I can imagine if we had a more pleasurable morning and you got to relax and you went through the day with your heart open, you might feel calmer and more trusting. 

00:27:55
ROBIN True. 

00:28:00
PAT LOVE Yeah. 

00:28:00
ROBIN Absolutely. 

00:28:00
PAT LOVE Yeah, I mean if we – if we were to spend more time together not only would I teach you the mirroring but I'd teach you validation, I would teach you empathy, which is really what you intuitively ask for in your request by the way. You said I'd like her to understand and sorta then let me have my own feelings about it, you know, which is exactly what you're asking. So I wanna switch for a moment, okay? 

00:28:25
ROBIN Okay. 

00:28:25
PAT LOVE So you can respond and Robin now I'm gonna ask her to mirror you. Just mirror you and it can be about this subject, it can be about your original subject, something you'd like her to hear and understand once and for all. And I'm gonna get her to -- if you can make it short, so she can say exactly what you're saying to get into your frame of reference and to be there for you. 

00:28:50
JOEL Well so often in the -- in the mornings I wake up early 'cos I have a lot on my mind. So I am just kind of verbalizing some of the things that I have to be confronted with as my day starts. 

00:29:05
PAT LOVE Okay, that’s a lot, but... 

00:29:10
JOEL No but that’s -- I was just kind of giving you the insight. 

00:29:10
PAT LOVE Getting it out there, oh okay, okay. Oh okay. 

00:29:15
JOEL What goes through, so when I say that I have to take care of a personal business and it’s bothering that, you know, how I'm gonna take care of it. I'm just expressing myself because it’s been on my mind and I’ve been talking to myself so much in the morning. 

00:29:35
PAT LOVE Okay. So tell her – give her the short piece you'd like or to hear and understand and mirror. 

00:29:45
JOEL When I'm – when in the morning I say things, I just want you to hear me. 

00:29:55
ROBIN In the morning you say things that you just want me to hear. 

00:30:00
JOEL I am going through some questions and answers in my own my mind and I just want you to hear me. 

00:30:05
ROBIN You're going through questions and answers in your own mind and you want me to hear you. 

00:30:10
JOEL I just wanna speak, I just wanna -- I just wanna start speaking, you know, to somebody close to me in the morning. 

00:30:20
ROBIN You just wanna speak to somebody close to you in the morning. 

00:30:25
JOEL And I guess I want validation that -- that you're hearing me and it’s too early to start, you know, making decisions on it, I haven’t made decisions on it. 

00:30:35
ROBIN You want some validation that I'm hearing you and not-no decisions are necessary, you just wanna be heard. 

00:30:45
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:30:45
PAT LOVE Tell her when you just listen to me, here's what it -- tell her what it does for you. Or if you can imagine, you know, if I could have you just listening and just, you know, being there and listening what would it do for you? 

00:31:05
JOEL If you would just listen to me, I would feel that I've gotten some it off my chest. 

00:31:10
PAT LOVE Wow! Wow! 

00:31:15
ROBIN If I will just listen to you, you would feel you got some it off your chest. 

00:31:20
JOEL And it might even help me go into the next phase of my decision-making, but just to know that I'm moving on or I'm expressing myself would be important to me. 

00:31:35
ROBIN So it might help you, um, to move on 'cos you know you'd be expressing yourself. 

00:31:40
JOEL Getting it outside of myself. 

00:31:40
ROBIN Getting it outside of yourself. 

00:31:45
PAT LOVE And when you take on -- I don’t know, don’t let me put words in your mouth, but when you-when you take -- when I express it and you just listen and the burden lifts then I can move on, is that what you're saying? 

00:32:00
JOEL Yes. Mm-hmm 

00:32:00
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. So, um, you – tell – let her know in a maybe another way and maybe the same words, the power of her listening, how helpful just listening is. Yeah, I'm not sure she – yeah. 

00:32:25
JOEL Sharing my thoughts with you helps me tremendously. 

00:32:30
ROBIN Sharing your thoughts with me helps you tremendously. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:45
JOEL Just being heard helps me tremendously. 

00:32:50
ROBIN Just being heard helps you tremendously. 

00:32:55
JOEL Being able to express myself helps me process. 

00:32:55
ROBIN Being able to express yourself helps you process. 

00:33:05
JOEL I -- I know I have a lot going on and in fact I always say I have too much going on at one time, but just getting it out there is the next step to moving on to the next place in my -- my head. 

00:33:20
ROBIN So you have a lot going on and, uh, just getting it out there helps you move on to the next step. 

00:33:30
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:33:30
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:33:30
PAT LOVE Does that – can you make a stab at that make sense to me because, just try and see if it fits. How – is there, at some level can you understand how that makes sense and just make a stab at it from his reality. 

00:33:50
ROBIN Um I guess like that would make sense like, like you're – you do your processing outside of yourself rather than inside of yourself and you just want me to be witness to your processing. Is that right? 

00:34:05
JOEL Yes that helps me. Yes because inside I seem to be playing the same scenario over and over again, but once I get it out there once I'm able to put it out there I'm able to move on to the next phase of it. 

00:34:25
PAT LOVE Hmm, and when you listen. 

00:34:30
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:34:30
PAT LOVE The burden lifts that’s what -- right? 

00:34:35
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:34:35
PAT LOVE When you listen- 

00:34:35
ROBIN Right. 

00:34:35
PAT LOVE The burden lifts. I don’t know if you knew that. 

00:34:40
ROBIN Well I knew that and I'm-I'm holding my tongue actually. 

00:34:45
PAT LOVE Good job, good job on that, good job on that. 

00:34:45
ROBIN I know we don't have much time. 

00:34:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:50
ROBIN I do have thoughts about that. 

00:34:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah hold on. 

00:34:50
ROBIN Okay. 

00:34:50
PAT LOVE Hold on. So, let’s do the last piece that's all we get. Yea, you're doing a good job on that. 

00:34:55
ROBIN Okay. 

00:34:55
PAT LOVE So here -- here's the last piece. The last piece is and 'cos you say when in the morning I'm gonna do mirror validation empathy, in the morning if I would listen and let you just talk about your thoughts, one the burden would lift and I can imagine if I did that regularly you might feel loved, appreciated and maybe even, like you said, motivated to go to the next step. Does that make – is that accurate? 

00:35:30
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:35:30
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:35:35
JOEL Certainly when I'm told -- when I'm given a solution that I don’t agree with it goes back a step or I stay right where I am. 

00:35:45
PAT LOVE Yeah. So instead of solution what you'd like is listening? 

00:35:45
JOEL Correct. 

00:35:45
PAT LOVE Yes. And when you listen it -- it sounds like – don’t let me put words in your mouth again, but if you would listen. 

00:35:55
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:35:55
PAT LOVE  And even I don’t know about the mirroring but just listen and maybe you know mirror some like you've been 'cos you're very good at that by the way. So when you mirror you know and you validate and say this make sense because it does lift the burden, it does take it off your chest and then – I think what you are applying is that it clears your mind to go on to your own solution. And if she did that, you would feel loved and supported and encouraged by her. Is that accurate? 

00:36:30
JOEL Yes. Yes, I think that’s accurate because I often don’t take her advice anyway just kinda puts me in an area that I'm just fighting with myself about something else that might -- might be brought out. 

00:36:45
PAT LOVE And my hunch is you would like -- your motivation is two-fold, one to lower your own anxiety- 

00:36:50
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:36:50
PAT LOVE -But second to be encouraging. 

00:36:55
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:36:55
PAT LOVE And to be encouraging and he's basically saying how you can be encouraging is to listen- 

00:37:00
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:37:00
PAT LOVE Is to listen. And one of the best ways to listen, by the way, is to mirror, you know, just listen to what he’s saying and then he might say this much, but you can mirror the kernel. You can mirror just the synopsis, so he'll know you're listening, and-and by the way it gives you something to do other than to be anxious because you cannot mirror unless you're paying attention- 

00:37:20
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:37:20
PAT LOVE  You have to got to pay attention. 

00:37:25
ROBIN Yeah, I can’t absorb it. 

00:37:25
PAT LOVE You can’t unless you tune -- tune in. And so what he’s really saying is, if you just tune in – now this is the fourth suggestion, you know, this might help you and my hunch is if you did it with mirroring, where you really had to focus and tune in that would -- 'cos you're not gonna be anxious while you're – if you're truly attune you're not going to be anxious 'cos you're not feeding the anxiety. 

00:37:55
ROBIN No matter what he’s saying. 

00:37:55
PAT LOVE No, no -- well he’s gonna be talking what you're gonna do is simply – your job is to mirror, validate, empathize. Mirror, validate and empathize and I promise you, if you do this long enough, your anxiety will go away 'cos if you don’t feed the anxiety, it will dissipate. And see you hear him say, he gets up and you hear him what it sounds like, you know, downloading all this information you know that’s come in during the night and he’s downloading it and you, you feel like "Oh! I have to fix it", and if you go there that’s gonna lower your anxiety. First off all he’s not gonna take it, you know, and then it cross conflict. 

00:38:35
ROBIN Right, right. 

00:38:35
PAT LOVE But your job is to simply if you choose to do this. 

00:38:40
ROBIN Right. 

00:38:40
PAT LOVE Mirror, mirror, mirror, validate, empathize, if you did this just a few short times your brain will catch on 'cos you're good at it you're sort of a natural. Your brain would catch on what, what -- all I need to do when he – when you hear 'cos you probably know with the tone of voice. Do you know what he's talking about when he's downloading, when he is doing the...? 

00:39:05
ROBIN Well you know what I'm thinking is, yes I do know and I stay with the content not the process of what he's doing and so I absorb it like "Oh my God! We got a problem". 

00:39:15
PAT LOVE And that’s what – that’s what you get to stop doing. 

00:39:15
ROBIN Yeah. Right. 

00:39:20
PAT LOVE Because it doesn’t help you it doesn’t help him. 

00:39:20
ROBIN Right it creates the problem.(crosstalk) 

00:39:20
PAT LOVE And it gets y'all started off on and just think what a pleasurable morning it could be. Every morning you get to give him this gift. Every morning this man who's loved you for 40 years you get to give him this and -- yeah. 

00:39:35
JOEL I have to add that -- that it would be better if she didn’t do it in a therapeutic way like right after I say it she comes right back at me. 

00:39:45
PAT LOVE But -- well here's the thing -- but here's the thing, here's the thing, if you – if you talk -- 

00:39:50
ROBIN I'm doomed. 

00:39:50
PAT LOVE  but here is – no, no if you mirror him accurately. 

00:39:55
ROBIN As he is. 

00:40:00
PAT LOVE You’ve got to match his tone and pace. 

00:40:00
ROBIN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:40:00
PAT LOVE Because if you do it you know like paraphrase that’s why paraphrasing doesn’t work. 

00:40:10
ROBIN Or with attitude. 

00:40:10
PAT LOVE Because it – or with attitude or with a pedantic air, you know? But if you mirror his actually tone and pace the way you were doing it – and it -- 'cos what you're doing is, and this is what you're asking, you want an experience of yourself and that – we don’t often get that in life and if I am mirroring you accurately, matching your tone and pace -- see a lot of people when they paraphrase they put their own spin, which is if you go back and watch this tape you'll see. 

00:40:45
ROBIN Yeah, there's a little. 

00:40:45
PAT LOVE That’s the inclination, like you wanna put your words on her sin. And even though this seems very mechanical at first to do exact words tone and pace you will feel her attunement because she cannot do that without tuning into you. You can – you can -- I can listen to you and sorta paraphrase what you're saying and already and make my grocery list, you know? Most women can do that, you know? 

00:41:15
ROBIN We can make a daily routine out of it. 

00:41:15
PAT LOVE Exactly we could, we could. But for the attunement that she's doing where she really matches your tone and pace she's there for you. And see – you see it 'cos you've got good eyes, but she has good eyes too. And y'all – when y'all do this where you really looking at each other and you're really tuned in, it won’t feel therapeutic, it will feel like this is my – this is my partner in life being there for me. 

00:41:45
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:41:45
PAT LOVE It's -that’s what you want. 

00:41:45
JOEL Right. 

00:41:45
PAT LOVE And she wants to be there for you. You can see that in her eyes. If y'all would just – if you can take. 'cos again you got these wonderful soft eyes, if you do that with her you'll see she's so longing to be there. You can see there in her eyes. 

00:42:05
JOEL Mm-hmm. 

00:42:05
PAT LOVE 'Cos see the eyes have these involuntary muscles you can’t lie. Your eyes, your eyes -- you know I mean you can think of something in your head, but if you truly engage her the more y'all do that and then the mirroring is attuned you won’t – you get – you will, 'cos even if you said to her "I'm feeling like you're being mechanical", and then she says this back to you in an attuned way your anxiety will come down 'cos – is it – am I making up stuff 'cos you said I want a more pleasurable morning. 

00:42:40
ROBIN Right. 

00:42:45
PAT LOVE And if you could have your heart open and have, you know, gratitude and have -- you know 'cos I think y'all both sorta want the same thing. You want- 

00:42:55
ROBIN Right. 

00:42:55
PAT LOVE -to live in harmony with each other. 

00:42:55
JOEL Right. 

00:42:55
ROBIN Mm-hmm. 

00:42:55
PAT LOVE You know and my hunch is you wanna be supportive to her, you wanna be supportive to him. 

00:43:00
ROBIN Right. 

00:43:05
PAT LOVE I mean I can feel the motivation, too bad we don’t have the camera here because your faces are just radiant at times when I see you talking, you know, to each other or having these feelings. So, mirror, validation empathy -- one more thing 'cos I know – you're right the time is running here. One thing you appreciate about each other. I want you to take a moment think of "Boy! One thing I so appreciate about you is" and then I'll get y'all to mirror that, an appreciation. 

00:43:40
ROBIN Okay. One thing I do so appreciate about you is that you handle so much of our daily stuff, that you let me go to work and do what I do and you handle so much of the stuff and I so appreciate that. 

00:44:05
PAT LOVE You could just mirror that back. 

00:44:10
JOEL You appreciate so much that I take care of so much of our day-to-day business. And the one thing I appreciate so much about you is that I can trust you indefinitely always to n-th degree and that’s very important to me. 

00:44:35
ROBIN And you trust me to the n-th degree and that’s so important to you. 

00:44:40
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:55
ROBIN I love you. 

00:44:55
JOEL I love you too. 

00:45:00
ROBIN That’s nice. 

00:45:05
PAT LOVE So here's what I’ve heard that some of the things that might make it a more pleasant morning or day or time together is one, expressing gratitude like you just did. Two, listening, truly listening and maybe it’s just listening because the good thing that ya’ll have that I don’t know always see, you know, and I see a lot of couples, but ya’ll have this ability to tune in to each other through the eyes. And so maybe what you're saying is when I am talking you can tune in and listen and just listen 'cos he'll know you're listening, by the way, you're so transparent that it’s, it’s really delightful. And you have a sharp, sharp focus, you both do, you both have that sort of intensity, you know, have you ever been to Esselen, they call it the Esselen stare, you know, where you're really present. You know it’s -- that you are really present, and so what you're saying is gratitude, what you're saying the true listening and -- and-and it’s-it's almost a paradox 'cos the more you listen, the more it builds trust in you and builds trust in him in you, you know, because you -- you get it Oh! If you listen and just let me think out loud and you take part of the burden just by listening then I'm ready to move on to the next step and of course continue to do the things that you said are so helpful that he runs interference and does so many of the jobs that allow you to go to work and just focus on work, you know, which is such a blessing. Um, the other thing I suggested neither of you picked up on, but I would say could also help is the skin on skin you know? The first thing, what I often tell couples, first thing in the morning whomever wakes up skin on skin before one person leaves the house -- whomever leaves the house, who leaves the house first in the morning? The home. 

00:47:20
JOEL Varies. 

00:47:20
ROBIN Yeah, varies. 

00:47:20
PAT LOVE Whomever leaves first you make contact which you probably do? 

00:47:25
ROBIN We do. We actually whoever gets up second, which usually is me and I'm giving you big hug. 

00:47:30
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:47:30
JOEL Yes. I don’t like to disturb her -- oh sorry -- I don’t like to disturb her. 

00:47:35
ROBIN Yeah, I like him to leave the bed give me a hug as he leaves, but he doesn’t want to disturb me. 

00:47:40
PAT LOVE That’s what I am thinking -- that’s what I am thinking and it can be this, it can be this that’s all. Which my hunch is will not disturb. All you have to is SOS, it doesn’t have to be anything, you know, first thing you get up when you leave the house, first thing when you get – come in I and you're both gonna be in home together at night and the last thing before you go to sleep. 

00:48:00
ROBIN We do that actually, we always kiss when we come in, I always kiss you. 

00:48:05
PAT LOVE So one more thing, what’s your secret because y’all been -- you beat the odds. 

00:48:10
ROBIN I know, we did. 

00:48:10
PAT LOVE You beat the odds. What you do think y’all's secret is? 

00:48:15
ROBIN Hmm good question, what do you think? 

00:48:20
JOEL I it's – it’s it’s perseverance. 

00:48:25
ROBIN And patience. 

00:48:25
PAT LOVE Perseverance, patience. 

00:48:25
ROBIN Patience, and um, and uh... 

00:48:30
JOEL Time. 

00:48:30
ROBIN I think trust. 

00:48:30
JOEL Time has helped. 

00:48:30
ROBIN Trust. 

00:48:35
JOEL Trust. 

00:48:35
PAT LOVE Joel's very, um, if I can say humble and trusting and kind, I'm not that way so much alright? I mean I'm kind, but you know I'll ask him I'll get jealous or I'll you know not be as trusting he – I could change my clothes three times in the morning, he won’t even notice that I’ve changed my clothes, but he, he's -- he's just big about life in -- well, I shouldn’t say it that way I guess, I don’t know, I don’t know. I'm a little more detail orientated probably and he's big global. 

00:49:10
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:49:10
JOEL I have to have accept the fact that so much of what Robin has said to me has not, you know, I had to learn to just to let it go rather than take it on. 

00:49:25
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. So, you've grown together. 

00:49:25
ROBIN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:49:25
JOEL Yeah. 

00:49:30
PAT LOVE So fantasy for the future as we stop. What’s one thing that you both could look forward to with each other, fantasy? 

00:49:45
ROBIN Fantasy for me would be that we, um, that we almost wanna sing a song before we leave the house together or dance a dance before we leave the house together. Just start off with a really good "Yes! Another day". 

00:50:05
PAT LOVE Yeah okay, okay that’s a fantasy, yeah. What would be your fantasy? Something together for the future. I mean big, small sky's the limit? 

00:50:25
[sil.] 

00:50:30
JOEL Um. Just, just continue to coexist and enjoy ourselves at the same time we enjoy each other, and nothing huge. 

00:50:35
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:50:35
JOEL Nothing huge, really just continue to be okay with each other and ourselves. 

00:50:40
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:50:45
JOEL More important because that’s -- that’s where I'm at really. 

00:50:45
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. Be okay with yourself and enjoy each other. Yes 

00:50:50
ROBIN And actually can I say one more fantasy? 

00:50:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:50:55
ROBIN That he would -- that he would mirror me in the morning. 

00:51:00
PAT LOVE Yeah that he would mirror you in the morning. Oh! That’s interesting. Yeah, so there's another option that y’all can do. 

00:51:05
JOEL She is so gay in the morning. I don't know. 

00:51:05
PAT LOVE Is she? Is she? Is she? 

00:51:10
JOEL I don’t know if I can do that. 

00:51:10
PAT LOVE Really? 

00:51:10
JOEL Yeah. 

00:51:10
PAT LOVE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:51:10
JOEL I mean the seeing and dancing before we leave. 

00:51:15
PAT LOVE You know what would be interesting, singing and dancing, it's a musical. Y'all's life is a musical. 

00:51:20
ROBIN I love musicals. 

00:51:20
PAT LOVE You know. You're Ingmar Bergman and you're -- So here's the point -- here's the point that in fact your point I think is well taken about the mirroring, you know, I don’t do this I only – I teach it to maybe, you know, 25% of my couples. It’s – it is magical because if you mirror her, you know, gayety – like you say "She's so gay in the morning", you know I went a lot of places when said that. So when said, you know -- so but if you mirror that and you truly mirror that ignites you, you know, it’s amazing it is contagious and even though it’s very, you know, it’s an exercise that we learn and when were beginning in graduate school, you know, it does work when you're there for each other, because here is why. What babies have to have is attunement. What adults have to have is attunement. 80% of couples who divorce or separate say we grew apart. We took away our interest and our energy. And one thing about mirroring, I mean you said I'd like that in the morning too you know, you might have to mirror her dance steps, you know, but the point is...

ROBIN That'd be great. 

00:52:35
PAT LOVE All it says that you're here and you're not judging me, you're not directing me, you're here for me. And that’s really what we want from the a partner. Is you are here for me. 

00:52:45
JOEL That's right. 

00:52:45
ROBIN Yeah. 

00:52:45

00:52:50
ROBIN Thank you. 

00:52:50
PAT LOVE Thank you, thank you. You're such a good sport, such a good sport. You wel- Thank you so much. Thank you so much, delightful. 

00:53:00
ROBIN Thank you. 

00:53:00
PAT LOVE Thanks. Okay, we got couple of -- time for a question or two, um, if someone would -- I just so appreciate the two of you for doing that, that takes a lot of -- yeah a lot of generosity, lot of generosity for doing that. You know to come up and to be up as a couple, it’s one thing to come up here by yourself, but to come up here as a couple and, uh, yeah. Any questions or comments? Yes. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Um, How would you feel that if there's some morning where, um, they wake up and he gets into a cranky mode again? 

00:53:35
PAT LOVE Yeah. You know one thing she can do is mirror because mirror, mirror, mirror it’s amazing, like I said, I don’t teach this to every couple, but literally there are couples who go out and it’s like magic, because you cannot have an argument when one person is mirroring and you can’t – but you have to do it, he made a very good point, you have to do with honor, meaning that I really do match your tone and pace because I can – you know you might say, um,-uh I am really -- I am really-I am really feeling uh at odds with myself today and I say well, you're really feeling at odds with yourself to -- you know you can put your own spin on it and you're really making a statement, but if I tune into you and mirror just – and that’s where I tell couples exact words, tone and pace, I even have them sort of learn to do the body you know mirroring the body, 'cos all it says is I'm here, I'm here and isn’t that why we have partners and friends, is for someone to be there for us. See your -- the limbic system, the part of your brain in charge to -- in charge of safety. The limbic system is a temporal, it’s without the concept of time. It doesn’t know you've grown up and so because we're not live breeders because a child can’t rear itself, you know, because we're depended longer than any other species, we have to have the care of another human being. Now obviously, you can survive without a primary partner, without close friends. But you won’t thrive as an adult without close friends, you know, you don’t have to have a partner, but you won’t thrive without close friends. Single greatest predictor of longevity and health is close personal relationships. So – and the reason is because it’s a survival strategy and the survival strategy is that once there's somebody there for me, my anxiety goes down. The limbic system can come down. So just being there that’s why as therapist, I used to think "Well, this feels more like a friendship, but I didn’t understand attunement". Never underestimate your presence, your attunement with your clients because it is life-giving and lifesaving. Thank you all for what you do. Thank you for coming, I really appreciate it. Thank you.
