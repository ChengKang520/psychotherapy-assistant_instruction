At the Corner of Me and Myself: Voices of Multiple Social Identities "Bisexual Poet Seeking Same" by Katrina Ruiz 

00:00:10
KATRINA RUIZ  My name is Katrina Ruiz. I am a member of the Apartment Poets and this is "Bisexual Poet Seeking Same". "Bisexual Poet Seeking Same" the title of my first personal ad. Let it read this two of the labels of objective I made, bisexual poet likes long walks on the beach, debates of ex-essentialist theory combining spiritual to politics and it doesn't always kiss on the first date. Bisexual poet, looking for another who chooses the classifying categories within his verbally rhythm boundaries. Bisexual poet likes to dance salsa, reheton(ph), hip hop sometimes all at once and enjoys to cook and speaks Spanish. Bisexual poet, looking for another to create clever T-shirts with street sign designs that say, "both ways" and the huh, "I'm not straight but my boyfriend is". Bisexual poet seeking same to recruit, other bi-girls at straight clubs to create a universal hand sign that gives you to go ahead and hit on her without running the risk of her, hitting you. Bisexual poet likes to question authority. We say, poetry to her lover in bed and on stage next evening to remind others of what they're missing when they mistook me for being straight or for being gay. Bisexual poet seeking same, same what? This poet seeks no more labels. I seek not to live with myself any of the words given to me because I haven't found the words for there's so many words out there. A person who I am, would only confine me. Limit me from the possibilities and only who shelter me further ignorantly. Maybe I'll claim my own term of people sexual, even though I'd still be defining who I am and what I am and who I like. It does not confine me to my actions, my gender, my attractions or feelings, choosing a category that suits me to fit inside this society is how I work and live within this community. I'm Cuban, so sign me up for the listeners for every Cuban who hates casuals(ph) to see their people set foot back on their Island, of course this is suppose the land of democracy. I'm Jewish, so ask me for my opinion in Israel, even though my family came from Spain and Turkey and I can pray too in Spanish, Latino, and Hebrew and there's no saving you. When you tell me I can't be both a Cuban and a Jew. I'm bisexual, though every time the term moves my mouth it enters the uncertainty and unease at confiding my own spirit and I remember the term is really more for my grandmother than it is for me because you see in her dreams prince charming is finishing his degree in saving me. I am a poet which is some definitions I found means I'm specially gifted in the expression of everything beautiful or lyrical. But truthfully, I searched the beauty and everything ugly, and everything uncomfortable, and everything questionable and I wanna tear down Ivory towers of poetry, poetry, with the capital P. My personal ad would read blank, symbolize that I can restrict myself to the power that words can imposed on ones personality that I will embrace every sexuality whether or not I identify with it or not because someone else does, and we're all the same one. So if you like girls, huh, so do I, if you like boys then so do I. If you like drug, trance, gentleman, whose dikes in the list of every other label out there and so do I, because I'm not looking to label myself anymore except there's another individual looking to unified the gaps between each and everyone of us. But if all you remember from this piece is the fact that I am Cuban but I am Jewish that I am bisexual, that I am a poet, that I'm all of this labels and you refer to me as that Jewban bisexual poet, hmm, and you've only limited yourself from every other possibility in realm of me. Thank you.

"Ako" by Sami Jenkis 

00:04:05
SAMI JENKIS  I am the heir to our future. The air expelled by lungs of an interracial marriage. My mother a Jewish New Yorker. My tatay, a Filipino who moved to the States. This was supposed to make me the best of both worlds. However, I feel I've gotten lost in the cracks. Thrown into the differences and gained nothing. [non-English narration]. What am I? My tatay never spoke to me in Tagalog. A regret he now holds but at the time he said he needed to work on his English. Both of my parents were afraid I might begin to mix languages like a delicious bowl of halo halo. The macapuno on my lips. The crushed ice on the tip of my tongue. Speaking in beans and lanka. The coconut milk would be my language. Every Thursday, my tatay would take me to the Filipino restaurant. We would order food my mother could cook just as well if not better. And I would listen to him converse in Tagalog. Speaking quickly the language escaped his mouth in steady rhythm as the crispy pata crunched its own rhythm in my mouth. Drowning out my confusion. I just nod and smile. Pretending I understand. My tatay laughs. They look at me and I laugh, hoping they're not discussing some barter involving my life. He continues on with his conversation as a bell just above the door rings signaling another customer has entered the store. A middle-aged man enters and begins to speak to me in Tagalog. [non-English narration] whistling through missing teeth, he asks me how I am. Struggling to find an adequate response, I mispronounce [non-English narration]. Everyone laughs. The missing tooth man retorts in English "Ano, why are you here? You're not Pilipino. "You can't even speak Tagalog." How thankful I am to men like these who think they can tell me who I am and am not. Reminding me I am still not at home in my father's culture. But it's funny because I'm not even at home in my native country. Because I don't resemble the staple American. Because I don't diet in the same anorexic fashion, because I don't wear the same trendy clothes. I am a perpetual foreigner. Your hair isn't straight enough. No, but my spine is. Your skin isn't pure enough. No, but my heart is. You're not the average white American. No, but my mother is. I am your America. I am the melted in your pot, I'm what was sought after by your arrogant forefathers. I'm a Filipino American. I'm an agnostic Jew. [non-English narration]. I am nothing. [non-English narration]. I am everything. I am your America. Now welcome home.

"The Laundromat" by Sandra Lambert 

00:07:55
SANDRA LAMBERT  My name is Sandra Lambert. I'm going to read a piece called the "Laundromat," it's an excerpt from the Adventures of Ivy, might as yet unpublished novel. "Hello, hello, hello!", her voice squeak barely penetrating the feedback screech of the answering machine. " Just a minute and I'll be with you!" Ivy dashed to the bed flip out of her wheelchair and picked up the phone. "Okay, Sarah, hi! sorry about that, did I catch you in the middle of something?" "No, well, yes. I was on my way to the laundromat but I hate everything about it so you're timing is perfect and then these days I have a rule about getting out of my chair whenever possible." " So you got out of your chair unto a couch?" "Oh, oh no my bed." "So how does your body feel?", "Ah, fine, I guess.", "Fine? That's it?", "Sarah, I'm confused, are you nagging me again about overdoing or trying to initiate phone sex?" "Well, I guess I was hitching my butts but if I have to choose it's the sex." "Well, aren't you suppose to ask me what I'm wearing?" "Or, I could ask you, Sarah, what are you wearing?" "Nothing except for one sock", " get out and I'm wet," "hey, that was fast, is your neck already flushed?" "You know, ever since first grade when I tried to lie about sending a mashed note to Sherly Anne(ph), this skin has betrayed me and that Sherly Anne, she was a piece of work even then. She's married now, third time, four grown kids, two grand babies but we still flirt. Leaves up the road if you," " Shut up about that hussy and tell me about being wet." "So I took a shower and I was sitting on the bed. I reached for my socks and thought of you. You know, thought of you, were(ph) of us really together I called and here we are. Maybe we should chit chat for awhile. How's your work?" "I'm managing." "How's your life?" "Fine. So, Ivy what are you wearing?" "Sweat pants and a frayed turtleneck. Should I have lied?" "No, no, I can work with that. Are you sitting or laying down." "I am reclining, excellent." Now, I bet that waste band is lose, isn't it? All stretch and easy to reach under. "How about you Sarah? Sarah, are you still there?" "Yes, but I just had an attack of embarrassment. You know, lets exchange pleasantries again like tell me something I don't know about cows that should be easy." "Uhm, did you know that cows will eat anything like the other day I couldn't find my Philips head and Sarah?" "Yes, Ivy forget the cows. We just need to commit, put your hand down, spread your lips and place your pointer and ring fingers on either side of," okay, I'm gonna have to pause here. Due to the time constraints of this video, is necessary that I move us forward directly to the Laundromat scene. " You are so inspiring." In Ivy's experience there was no way to shut them down once they started but she tried anyway with a tight smile and a heart turn towards her last dryer. Ivy open the glass door and held tight to ankle her chair close. It reassured Ivy that except for the rhine stone glasses. The woman looked about her own age at least she couldn't have any crippled up grandchild to talk about still Ivy put her head into the drum. "Really, so amazing." The voice was directly behind her. Ivy pretended she was retrieving a sock. Watching her shoulders and head deeper into the dryer. It was steamy, dark, and quiet then the woman's voice echoed around her. "My niece poor thing. Its a tragedy for her parents really. She's got the same thing as you. It's a miracle, you can do for yourself like this. I'm gonna tell them I saw you. It'll give them a little hope. My brother's wife, she, "Ivy push the mute button in her head and flap out of the dryer, pulling a towel with her. There were bits of Kleenex all over and Ivy picked out the towel. The woman's mouth was still moving, the glasses frame sparkled as it move closer. Anticipating getting her head padded. Ivy clutch the towel both hands, shook and then snapped but I always say, God doesn't, the monologue stumbled as the towel cracked at the woman's chest. "Oh, look my machine has stopped. Now I'll be right over there if you need any help." Thinking the confrontation was over, Ivy turn to reach for more laundry. Letting her mind uncoil into its pre-dreadful Laundromat lady after glow, that's Sarah. Maybe she'd write a letter to Bell(ph) Self(ph) thanking them for their excellent phone service. Ivy was laughing and composing in her head when two arms snaked around her neck, overlapped on her chest and tightened, a soft, "Jesus loves you" was a whisper in her ear and the moistness of the woman's breath dripped unto Ivy's neck, making a firm decision not to bite. Ivy sank her nails into the soft forearms and held on. As the woman try to escape. She turned her head so their faces were close. Fuck you bitch! Fuck Jesus! Touch me again and I'll call the cops. She let go and the arms whipped back, footsteps rushed away from her. Ivy wiped her neck and pulled her shirt away from her body. It was damp with the woman had touched her. Why would these people always sweating? At least "fuck" was still the magic word. Pass combinations of "damn Jesus," "screw Jesus" or a "fuck off" without the Jesus had not been effective repellants. Ivy pulled another towel out of the dryer and held it to her chest, warming her heart before she began to fold. Thank you.

"i am not other. ako ay mestiza." by L. Capco Lincoln A borderland is a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and forbidden are its inhabitants. Los atravesados live here: the squint-eyed, the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel, the mulatto, the half-breed, the half dead; in short, those who cross over, pass over, or go through the confines of the "normal." -Gloria Abzaldua i am not other. ako ay mestiza. Written and directed by l. capco lincoln 

00:14:35
L. CAPCO LINCOLN  That one eye open, I watched this world for the first several years of my life. Living under everything I could, tables, beds but most of all bridges and like a troll, I hid every part of me that did not fit in. With one eye closed I still could see the imperfections that pounded over my head like the kids on the playground yelling. "Hey girl, where are you from? Hey, what are you?" I wash myself in this, scrubbing my skin as much as I could because I didn't understand. I did not understand the line that I was carefully walking, caught in between two different worlds. Most people know conveniently where they belong but some of us are caught somewhere in between here and there. We are stock on the borderlands were we choose to keep both feet in both places or to hold on to one and forget the other or to change with the tads thrown at us or to just sit on the border with our legs cross and with one hand on each side, refusing to make distinctions. I never learn to speak my mother's tongue. [non-English narration] Tagalog. Growing up, I mostly ate Steak and potatoes and apple pie. I was too young to remember our trips to the Philippines before my mother got too busy with a full-time job and my parents are too afraid that the children were going to be kidnap to be able to return anytime in the next decade. With one eye closed I could not see a crust ocean. [non-English narration] but that do not prevent my favorite food from being Pansit and my favorite dessert being flan de leche even though I was surrounded by my father's family and heritage. I still do not fit wholly inside the white picket fence. When I was nine-years-old, this boy who sat behind me in class would asked over and over, day after day, "What are you? Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and everyday he said it with little bit more stronger Asian accent and everyday he would mockingly slid his eyes a little more until finally I left every class crying harder and harder. When people would ask where I was from or what I was, it became natural defense to say I am an American. [non-English narration] I am from here, I was born in the city in a hospital down the street. They didn't understand what I told them. I do not understand what they asked. More recently, somebody asked me more politely what my ethnicity was, I told them I was half Filipino and half American. He laughed, "you know what we call you?" I shook my head and with a big smile he said, "Heinz 57." He expected me to laugh with him, instead, I did nothing. With one eye open, I played a lot of imaginary games when I was growing up, I use to pretend I could speak several languages that only I could understand with exception of a few close friends. I use to pretend that people thought I was a boy, when I tried to blur ah, people's perception and strut around with all my hair stuffed into a baseball cap. Then there was a time when I pretended people didn't noticed that I was different. I used to stare in the mirror and try to see if I could open my eyes a little wider so they didn't look so lazy or slanted. I used to cover half of my face with my hair partially for style and the rest, so I could pretend that it made, my face looks slimmer got the narrow faces of the White girls in my class or in the magazines. When I was 17, I finally got to go back to the Philippines and see my family that I hadn't seen or even remembered for 13 years. I didn't understand their rosaries, I didn't understand my lola Monang(ph) speaking to me, a mile a minute in a language that I didn't know. I didn't understand their six storey mall that they brought me to in the first few hours that I arrived. But they didn't understand why I wear baggy jeans and t-shirt that didn't show off my figure. They didn't understand why I looked and walk like a boy. They didn't understand why I refuse to eat their meat. For the first time in my life somebody told me I look more like my father, it barely resembled my brother, kuya, you understand don't you? We have been twins ever since I moved in to your life, when you were five, he and I realize we do not belong here nor there. We floated somewhere in between each land. Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Finally, with both eyes open, I could not bare to see the world all at once. When I was born, a line was draw on street down my back each part of me is a contradiction. The colonize and the colonizer, the oppressed and the oppressor, I stand up in this line [non-English narration]. I'm not other. I'm mestiza. Acclaimed the in-between world in the borderlands were I fight the contradictions and become part of the answer with both eyes open, I can finally say I belong. [non-English narration]. This is the place for me.

00:21:15
KRISTIE SOARES  My name is Kristie Soares. I'm part of the Apartment Poets spoken work poetry troop and this is a poem whom I called, "Cuban, Brazilian, Bisexual Me." I've come to realize that I hate my own people because I have no people. Friday night is Fiesta Latina but the Cubana me is nowhere to be found. Wednesday night is Fiesta Brazileda(ph) but the Brazileda(ph) me is feeling just too weird to go out but on Thursday night which is gay night she's just not queer enough. She's not American enough for white night which is every night in this town and she's not smart enough to just stay home. I am a feminist which equals anti-machista(ph) which equals anti-Latino male which equal dancing alone all night. I am bisexual which equals, I also like women which equals they're wearing those short skirts for the men not for me. And if I stare, I'm just another jealous bitch but the only one I'm jealous of is the man that gets all of your attention. I'm Cuban so I'm not American in Miami. I'm American so I'm not Cuban in Santiago. I'm Brazilian which equals exotic to some men but it equals way too dark skin for my Latino man. And I don't salsa so I come around here tonight with my girlfriend coz I don't need your attention. Macho bastard who drink too much except that I do. Because Salsa is a union between a man and a woman and it is beautiful. As is Latino culture as is this culture that I do not have. I don't samba but I get by on my body which in Brazilians find 60 percent of the time because 60 percent of the people are darker than me but in Cuba, the percentage is much less so I'm worth much less and I don't samba so I shuffle pretending I don't notice it. That I don't notice my fellow Braziledas(ph), my fellow Brazilian woman looking like "hey, how was my butt? Be careful not to move too much I might get sweaty." I wish I could break out of this restraining window display of a body and into his soccer shorts and get him another plate of food, hose. And the men, my Brazilian men look like, I just finish playing soccer didn't even bother to clean the dirt off of my leg or change my nasty T-shirt because I know you'll still want me. Babakas(ph) or assholes and I'm not them but I'm not the women though I wanna sleep with them both and not because I'm a sexaholic(ph) but because I love women and I wanna show them how to love women and that their mothers were women so be careful were you put your goods. I have no culture because the gay people hate a whole half of me, so I come around with my girlfriend again as though she's a trophy though she's not and I've never considered her to be one but I pretend so that they'll notice me and they'll sign me up for their mailing list because I so desperately need somewhere to belong because I so desperately need someone to know that I mean nothing to anyone but me because I have slept with the women who hate me and other women and I have slept with the men who hate us too. And I feel racist and sexist and homophobic but I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not of those thing. I love everyone so long as they're not drunk, high, violent, ignorant or prejudice. And it is my fault that in this town those people just happened to be the White people, riding the later gay or bus home at two o'clock in the morning, singing "move bitch, get out the way, get out the way bitch, get out the way," when they're bitches themselves in the eyes of those around them or their mothers were bitches so to speak. And I don't hate them but I hate their presence. And I despise the word keg and I despise anyone who would wanna fuck me tonight and then hire me to clean his house in the morning or with things you can save me by falling in love with me but I don't mean that except that it's hard to remember how to be brave and to remember that they will find God and that I'm me. I'm not different pieces of different cultures making up a discorded piano. No, I'm me but it'd be so nice to someone other than me, knew it too. And it'd be so nice if deep down inside me I did and so want that someone to be a man, every man of every race and culture to say. " I am in love with you, you Cuban, Brazilian, Bisexual woman you and by the power vested in me by the hetero-centric, racist, society, that hates you I validate your presence in this world."
