Brief Counseling: The Basic Skills Counselor and Narrator: John M. Littrell, Ed.D. 

00:00:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  I'm Dr. John Littrell, professor and program coordinator of the school-counseling program at Iowa State University. In this video, brief counseling the basic skills, I'd be demonstrating how to do brief counseling using Allen Ivey's microcounseling framework. In this tape, we will illustrate five stages of the microcounseling interview. These are: Rapport and structuring, defining a problem, defining a goal, exploration of alternatives and confronting incongruities, and generalizations to daily life. You will notice that while all five stages of the interview are found in our session, they are not presented in a sequential fashion. 

00:00:55
The First 3 Stages of the microcounseling interview: 

00:00:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL For example, we'd begin with Stage 1, rapport/structuring; and then we'll move to Stage 3, defining a goal. Later, we return to Stage 2, defining a problem. In addition to the five stages of the interview, we have captions on microcounseling skills so that you can appreciate how they are used in brief counseling. My client in this tape is Adam. As is typical of many clients, Adam has a tendency to focus on what doesn't work rather than on what does work. As worked with Adam, I helped him to search for positives. In other words, we looked for his strengths and his resources. We will also be exploring exceptions, times when the problem did not occur or occurred less. In our interview, I will be asking a number of questions to help Adam explore an issue. Specifically, I will be asking, questions that are open-ended, questions that access resources and strengths, and a miracle question. As you watch the videotape and study its transcript, you will learn how brief counseling and microcounseling skills can be blended to help a client. 

00:02:05
Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring 

00:02:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Adam, I'm real pleased- (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
ADAM Okay. 

00:02:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - to meet you. And one of the things often from, people first get to know each other. It's a little bit of building rapport. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL And, so, one of the questions I sometimes asked is, do we have rapport? 

00:02:25
ADAM I think we do. 

00:02:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Okay. Anything that I could do that would increase the force? 

00:02:30
ADAM Uhm, I think you've done very well and we've spoken somewhat- (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:02:35
ADAM - beforehand and I feel very comfortable talking with you right now. 

00:02:40
Stage 3: Defining a Goal 

00:02:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL  At this point in the interview, I move from Stage 1, rapport and structuring, to Stage 3, goal setting. I do this by asking Steve de Shazar's miracle question. 

00:02:55
Miracle Question 

00:02:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL If we were successful in helping you even within about 40 minutes that we have today, and you were to wake up tomorrow morning and this miracle has happened,- (crosstalk) 

00:03:05
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and at the same time, because it's a miracle and you're asleep, you really didn't know that happened.- (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
ADAM Yes. 

00:03:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL What would be the first indication to you that in some ways, you were on the right track,- (crosstalk) 

00:03:20
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL - in the direction that you wanted to be headed? 

00:03:20
Adam describes his goal 

00:03:20
ADAM I would say that I would have, maybe, some, some courage to stand up, rise to the occasion, if you will- (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
ADAM - uhm, and, and, ah, artfully phrase what I would wanna say in, start confrontation type of situation. (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Couple of things. So, there would be a verbal part of being able to phrase it, say it in such a way- (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL - that is different from maybe how it is now or has been.- (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL But also, you talked about a little you're kinda standing up. 

00:03:55
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL And what, what's that? Tell me a little bit more about? 

00:03:55
Specifying the goal 

00:03:55
ADAM  Uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL How we would know if that were happening? 

00:04:00
ADAM - I, I think I would feel it from, from within. (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
ADAM Uhm, it would be the situation where I, I would be fully aware that I was under this strain or pressure. Uhm, but then, I was sort of confident enough to, I say, rise up and then sort of, not, not, uh hmm, and the word is kinda difficult for me to find. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:04:25
ADAM Uhm, be how I would normally be by myself in that situation uhm, get the stress out of the situation so I can respond the way I normally would,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:04:35
ADAM - respond. 

00:04:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL  In a manner typical of brief counseling, I guide the client to state a goal early in the session. In the process, I use open-ended questions, minimal encouragers, and paraphrasing to help define what Adam wants. 

00:04:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL So if you were, in some ways, nor, you'd be more normally responding in that situation rather than somehow having stress or feeling stressed. 

00:05:00
ADAM Yeah. We would normally be in quotations. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
ADAM - to say, to say how- (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:05:05
ADAM - each situation is different- (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:05:05
ADAM - uhm, but, to, to act myself in some situations, I- (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
ADAM - get under such stress that I lose my words and I'm not quite myself. 

00:05:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. So if you were, you'd be handling that situation being "more yourself,"- (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL - ah, and what would be smaller indicator is kind of from outside, if I was kind of an intrusive observer in that case? (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL What would I see, what would I'd be hearing that would say, "Oh, Adam is more- (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
ADAM  I, I think,- (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - himself"? (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
ADAM - I think it would be, ah, aggressive? 

00:05:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
ADAM Uhm, more forthright and, ah, confident, confidence behind my words. 

00:05:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:05:50
Continued goal specification 

00:05:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Would you give me an example just even right now as you're sitting here- (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:05:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - if you were in that state? 

00:05:55
ADAM  If I were in that state? (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yes. In other words, right now, being more assertive. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uhm. 

00:06:05
ADAM  Well,- (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL In fact, even in the chair. How would you? 

00:06:10
ADAM - well, in, in that situation, I would definitely, I would, my back would be, my posture would be way up. 

00:06:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Okay. 

00:06:20
ADAM Uhm. 

00:06:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL More like that. 

00:06:20
ADAM More like this. 

00:06:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:06:20
ADAM Uhm, I would be sort of, ah, very forthright in what I'm saying. 

00:06:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:06:30
ADAM Uhm. 

00:06:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL I know, as you said forthright, even removing your hand there. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
ADAM Yes, forthright. Uhm, the, you know, some power maybe behind it, uhm, with confidence behind it. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
ADAM Uhm, confidence of what I'm saying is not just me saying it but that I truly believe in what I am saying. 

00:06:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
ADAM Uhm, sort of, ah, inner knowledge that I'm right. Uhm. 

00:06:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL At this point, I facilitate the examination of existing resources and assets that Adam can use to achieve his goal. This process tends to engender hope and instill confidence, especially as Adam begins to recognize he has these skills needed to achieve his goal. 

00:07:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL And when have you had that parti-, those particular qualities in your past? 

00:07:10
ADAM  Most of the time. Uhm, it, it, sort of fails when I am suddenly confronted with the situation where I need, maybe I where, I lack the time to assess the situation that I'm in, uhm, like the, the confident that I had had last week,- (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:30
ADAM - uhm, where I was taken off-guard if I had time to prepare, then I still go and forth. 

00:07:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL If you're prepared, then you're able to have- (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:07:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - that, those qualities that you need. 

00:07:45
ADAM Hmm. 

00:07:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Ah, but in, at least, in a situation in the past year, recently, you didn't have that sense of being prepared. 

00:07:50
Stage 2: Defining the Problem 

00:07:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Note that in a manner typical of many clients, Adam has a tendency to dwell on what he does not want rather than on what he does want. 

00:08:05
ADAM  I was taken extremely off-guard. 

00:08:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:08:10
ADAM And that sort of, ah, made me retreat, maybe within myself and even though I was standing at the scene, I think my posture, you know, would have been down. 

00:08:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:08:15
ADAM  And, ah, in fact, if I recall it, I think, I ended up leaning against the wall at the time. (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:25
ADAM I had started out standing straight. Uhm, both hands, you know, wrapped in front of me- (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
ADAM - and I ended up having both hands, I think, behind my back, leaning against the wall and trying to take in what was happening. So, uhm. 

00:08:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL  That was seeking supports? 

00:08:40
ADAM Yeah. Yeah. Almost like I would have continued to walk backwards had there not been a wall to keep me from doing so. (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:08:45
ADAM Uhm, and those situations scare me- 

00:08:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
ADAM - sometimes. Ah, it's in a control thing, I think. 

00:08:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
ADAM Uhm, but it doesn't happen all that, all that often. 

00:08:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. When you say not all that often, we talking once a month? Once a year? Uhm. 

00:09:05
ADAM And it's, in a normal course of life, there are things, uhm, sometimes, you, you have a weaker(ph), you have a lot of situations that come up like that and then when uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
ADAM - have weeks or months for, uhm, on top of my game and nothing more would shake me at all. 

00:09:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
ADAM Uhm, so it's, it's, you know, variable. 

00:09:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL As we continue, I plant the seed that Adam can generalize what he is learning in this interview to other aspects of his daily life. 

00:09:30
Issue is generalized to other situations 

00:09:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL So it's, it strikes me then you have a some, recently, there has been a very specific example of this but there,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - there are also some other times when this would be a useful skill to have- 

00:09:40
ADAM  Yeah. 

00:09:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - uhm, so that I could, we could focus maybe on one but it also could generalize to some other- 

00:09:50
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL - situations we're in. 

00:09:50
ADAM You see, in this situation was, you know, professional context and, ah, you know, there are some social situations that I've had with friends, uhm, where some incident had happened and they would catch me when I come home or something on the phone- (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
ADAM - and installing, you know, start with an accusation, uhm, or some sort of challenge to me- (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
ADAM - but I wasn't quite ready for it. And, ah, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL So it's like being taken off-guard- (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
ADAM Yeah. 

00:10:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL - or when you're not prepared for something and all of the sudden somebody comes and challenges you or confronts you that those moments would be useful- 

00:10:30
ADAM Yeah. In, in those. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL - that was in your skills. You're, sort of, eluded to then, that there's something maybe coming up that might be a test to this. Uhm, how would we know if put your learning here, it can be useful and work might be applied? 

00:10:45
ADAM Uhm, well, I work from the schools, right now at a high school. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
ADAM And, uhm, and the usual, as a guidance counselor, and then in the usual context of business, I'm associating with teachers and other members of faculty and parents and I come across this grand old parents and teachers daily,- 

00:11:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
ADAM - uhm, and in the situations that I don't exactly know everything in, which is, quite, quite many, I would say. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:10
ADAM These, these techniques would, would be very useful on a daily basis. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
Searching for exceptions to the problem situation 

00:11:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL What would be some examples, Adam, of when somehow someone has caught you off-guard, and at the same time, you didn't kinda go back to and use, this particular pattern,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL - but that you've handled it in an okay fashion. What would be some examples of that? 

00:11:35
ADAM There was an incident that happened, uhm, with a former landlord of mine,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
ADAM - uhm, where he had approached me, ah, where I live and had made some accusations about the condition of the house that we had lived in and, ah, relationships between us had gotten, had deteriorated for, for a quite some time to the part when he came to me, we're actually in a process of moving out- 

00:12:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
ADAM - uhm, and breaking our lease. And when he came to me with these accusations, uhm, I was very confident in my argument, uhm, and in the confrontation that then that happened. Uhm, and I was very proud of myself afterward. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
ADAM Uhm, I was shaking. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
ADAM Uhm, I have walked out and I, my hands are visibly trembling. 

00:12:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:12:25
ADAM And my voice was trembling. Uhm, but I had held my ground and, uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL And you're proud of yourself. 

00:12:30
ADAM And I was very proud of myself for it. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
ADAM  And those who had seen, witnessed the little altercation he wilt(ph)- (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:12:35
ADAM - or ah, had said to me, "Wow, I haven't quite seen that side of you- (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:12:45
ADAM - some time." 

00:12:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. How did you do that? 

00:12:45
ADAM  I don't really know. And, and, and let me back on it. And, and when I left, it was one of those, wow, ah, I can't believe I- (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
ADAM - stood up to him like that. Uhm, that, that confrontation I had anticipated for quite some time and every time I thought it was coming, it didn't happen. 

00:13:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:13:05
ADAM So this time, I, I knew it might happen but I wasn't quite ready for it to happen. 

00:13:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
ADAM And, uhm, I called on something, you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
ADAM I don't know exactly what it was but something, ah, when I had seen him pull up, I said, "Here, here it goes,"- 

00:13:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
ADAM - and I, he just popped in the door. Uhm. 

00:13:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL So you pulled on something. 

00:13:25
ADAM Sort of I think of it as a uhm, sort of, like a reserve energy. 

00:13:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
ADAM And my normal self, it just depleted. 

00:13:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:13:35
ADAM Just hit empty and then I calls on his backup, sort of, energy. 

00:13:40
Summary of positive strengths 

00:13:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL So somehow, you're able to pull on that backup energy in that moment. 

00:13:45
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL And, so even though you came out, maybe shaking a little bit, at the same time, a real sense of pride of, "Hey. I stood up. I did what needed to be done here." 

00:13:55
ADAM Yeah. And I, I feel the whole range of emotions as I think about it and,- (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:13:55
ADAM - and say that I stood up at this time. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
ADAM And when I remember how it went, ah, my hands are little sweating- 

00:14:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:14:05
ADAM - and I can feel my, my legs, you know, shake a little bit. 

00:14:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
ADAM Uhm, and it was quite, quite an impact in afternoon. 

00:14:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Next, I asked Adam to re-experience the time when there was an exception to his problem behavior. I guide him to visually, emotionally, and physically relive that experience. Thus, Adam is able to experience important clues that accompany goal behavior. In the balance of this session, it becomes increasingly evident from Adam's posture, expression, and definition of the situation that he is experiencing a transformation of his self-image. 

00:14:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL I know you just told me you don't know where that came from,- (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - but I'm gonna maybe just ask you to go inside and ask yourself that question and maybe not consciously but images or sounds that come up to you. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
ADAM Uhm, yeah. I'd, there's a, an image of anger that comes up- (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
ADAM - when I, when I, when I think of this person, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
ADAM I, I feel angry. When I saw him, I felt angry. 

00:15:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
ADAM Uhm, I don't know if that was the source of the energy that had driven me to stand up the way I did. But there's definitely a feeling of, of wronged and I'm gonna do right this time. 

00:15:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
ADAM Uhm, and I could have called on that. I, I could have, you know, thinking about it, figured it was the last time I was gonna see him- (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
ADAM - and then maybe my, my only last chance and I didn't wanna situation to pass I would regret. 

00:15:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. It sounds like it becomes important enough to somehow I need to be able to respond because I may not have other chances- (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - or this is, this is the time. 

00:15:45
ADAM Yeah. Sort of cease the moment. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL And, you draw and cease the moment. So, you know, as we're talking right now that start to you in experiencing your own body, somewhat what that's like. 

00:15:55
ADAM Yeah. It's, it's a hard thing for me to do, to stand up, uhm, and politely but, and artfully, yet, aggressively confront someone older than myself. 

00:16:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
ADAM You know, when I was growing up, it was don't talk back to adults. 

00:16:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
ADAM And as I deal with adult and especially in a professional sense now,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
ADAM - uhm, there's a little sense about me that's, that's, you know, I'm not quite qualified to speak to them like that or, or what, ah, what now. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
A powerful exception is pointed out 

00:16:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm, Uh hmm. So you got the message growing up, be? 

00:16:30
ADAM  Polite. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Polite, ah, and yet, at the same time, you just gave me an example, at least of one,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - at one situation of there's an override to that. 

00:16:40
ADAM Certainly. As you,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uhm. 

00:16:40
ADAM - as you grow up, you, you know the override that says, uhm, not to continually go back to the phrase by calling on that time and- (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
ADAM - realizing the moment that you're in and saying this is one of those times where that really doesn't apply and you have to- (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
ADAM - go strictly from your inner, sort of, ah, instinct- (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
ADAM - about how to handle the situation. (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL As Adam discusses an attempted solution, I amplify his solution of replaying and reconstructing situations. By amplification of his solution prompts his recognition that these are behaviors that have been effective in the past. 

00:17:25
ADAM I think about my conversations with, with everybody, ah, quite a bit,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
ADAM - well when I'm driving or a spare time, and, ah, even things that go the way I had intended them to go, I'm, I'm reflecting on those conversations. And, when the conversations don't go the way I want and I replay them and sort of reconstruct them,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
ADAM - I try and think that the next time, this is how I will,- 

00:17:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:17:50
ADAM - how I will do it. 

00:17:55
Positive reframe of attempted solutions 

00:17:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, are those reconstructions and replays, is that a helpful process? 

00:18:00
ADAM Yeah. I find it helpful. 

00:18:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Let me just check something out. 

00:18:05
ADAM Okay. 

00:18:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL I wasn't quite sure if you like the length of time that you have to do that. 

00:18:10
ADAM Sometimes, I don't like the length of the time, uhm, especially, when it doesn't go the way I want. And I don't mean to say it didn't go the way I want so I'm, you know, nothing selfish- (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:18:20
ADAM - or crying or anything. Uhm, sometimes, it bothers me. I spent time dwelling, uhm, but at other times, it really, I find it a constructive tool that I use with myself to ah, to better myself, really. 

00:18:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
ADAM I don't know when I started doing it. Uhm, how I really, I was replaying conversations. 

00:18:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
ADAM But, I find, I found it, and I found it helpful. I mean, even- (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
ADAM - if it doesn't help me in the next one, it makes me feel better about the, the one that just passed. 

00:18:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. So it's useful in a feed-forward, sort of fashion of, it helps me to anticipate and what I might do in the next situation or future situations,- (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
ADAM Yeah(ph). 

00:19:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - but it also helps you to feel better in some ways about what has just maybe occurred. 

00:19:10
ADAM Yeah. 

00:19:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL It sounds like a very positive useful function there. 

00:19:15
Stage 3: Defining Goals Continued 

00:19:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Like, you know, we started in some ways with a miracle question. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ADAM Uh-huh. 

00:19:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Ah, we've also talked about how you use, in some ways, the replay as a way of helping you to deal with something that has occurred, going forward. Where can we spend our time with the short amount of time that we do have today? What would be helpful now at this point in terms of where you'd like to take it in terms of the choice for direction? 

00:19:45
ADAM Uhm, well, maybe the, the instance in where I failed. 

00:19:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, what is it you, you indicated in some ways that should, would have like to done that better? 

00:20:00
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Now, we started to talk about some resources that would have been useful there. What else would've been helpful on looking ahead to make sure that in the future you've got those resources more accessible? 

00:20:15
ADAM This was really the first of, the first negative experience, uhm, I had in this school, uhm, with a confrontation of this kind. 

00:20:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:20:25
ADAM  And so, I'm hoping that my replaying of things- (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:20:30
ADAM - will allow me to, to, to really have confidence that, that I'm right or even if I'm not right that I can at least intelligently defend myself in the future and I think if I were in a similar situations, the second I realize, this situation is comparable to the last- (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
ADAM - that I'm gonna kick into that overdrive and be able to act in the way that I, I did not last week. (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. So as you, you said to yourself at times, I get surprised and taken off-guard and so on, uhm, how in the future, what would be useful to be able to make sure that you're not taken off-guard? 

00:21:20
ADAM That's a good. I don't know. That's a good question. Uhm, I, I think, well, when you're being taken off-guard is, is a good and a bad thing- (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
ADAM - I think it, it keeps things interesting. It keeps things exciting. (crosstalk) 

00:21:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
ADAM And I hate to say that I want everything in my life, uhm, to be planned and know about it ahead of time so that nothing catches me off-guard. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
ADAM I think that would make things boring. Uh, what I'd like to be,- (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
Minor confrontation 

00:21:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, it sounds quite like perfection. 

00:21:45
ADAM - yeah. But what I'd like to be able to do is to be taken off-guard and compose myself when I am- (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:21:50
ADAM - and not be taken off-guard and retreat within myself and hide, uhm, almost in the coward like way. 

00:22:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
ADAM I enjoy being taken off-guard. I just like to, to rise to that. 

00:22:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Ah, in the counseling profession ah, that Dickens(ph) Paterson(ph) kept ah, has used the expression "recovery skills." 

00:22:10
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
Summary of client's goals 

00:22:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uhm, it sounds like I'd like, I'd like to have a little bit faster recovery skills rather than- (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
ADAM  Yeah. Yeah. 

00:22:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL - really being- (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
ADAM Yeah, and, and I think everybody, everybody, I've, that I've spoken to and myself or even, uhm, you, you have a situation and you walk away from it and you say, "How I wish I had said this," or "How I wish I had done this." And I, I know that, that's normal, uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
ADAM - for, for everyone to experience. Uhm, but sometimes it, it gets to me, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. It sound like this particular one really got to you. 

00:22:45
ADAM This one really got to me. 

00:22:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
ADAM And uhm, this one occupied my weekend. 

00:22:50
Interview Recycles Back to Stage 2 for More Data 

00:22:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  What about this particular one that seemed to knock you for a little bit(ph)? 

00:22:55
ADAM  I, I think partly 'coz it was the first one that had happened in this professional setting. (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
ADAM And I'm trying to, sort of, set a standard that, a professional standard of which all, all, you know, behave regularly. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:23:10
ADAM Uhm, the other one, I think, another thing like, that I said I truly believe that I was right and I truly believe that this other person, this teacher was wrong. 

00:23:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
ADAM Uhm, and yet, even knowing that at that time, I really, I didn't say anything. I just, sort of, accepted what this teacher was saying to me loudly. Uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah(ph). 

00:23:30
ADAM I thought the teacher was very irrational as well and so a part of my problem was, sort of, understanding the situation, that it happened. I was very confused. 

00:23:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
ADAM Uhm, I've really tried to visualize what I and that teacher look like- (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
ADAM - and what the hallway look like and, sort of, just, if I were a fly on the wall, what I would have observed- (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:23:50
ADAM - in that ten minutes, and, and I, I really didn't like it. 

00:23:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
ADAM I really didn't like it, you know, I really didn't like it. It, it bother me that I didn't like it,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
ADAM - it bother, uhm, that the reasons behind my not liking of what I was doing- (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
ADAM - and did not like. Uhm, that's it. 

00:24:05
Focus on client's strengths 

00:24:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL You sound even as we're talking, like there's a resolve that you already made that- (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL I'm not gonna be going through this again. 

00:24:15
ADAM I've,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Is that too strong? (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
ADAM I've, I've no, I definitely feel I have made that resolved. 

00:24:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ADAM Ah, I don't know if I can leave it until the next one. 

00:24:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
ADAM Ah, but I, you know, worked hard to, sort of, separate myself and say, "Okay, this has passed." And I've worked in, I ever since had, uhm, meetings with different people in the school. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
ADAM And I've actually confronted that teacher again. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
ADAM I wish it had been at the time. 

00:24:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Oh, how did that go? 

00:24:45
ADAM It went, well, it went wrong. Ah, it took that this particular incident happened with ah, five minutes left in the school day. 

00:24:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
ADAM And, ah, there was no, sort of, feedback from other colleagues of mine. 

00:25:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
ADAM The day ended and I left. 

00:25:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
ADAM And when I left, I was definitely shaking again. 

00:25:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
ADAM Uhm. 

00:25:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL In this next sequence, shaking and anxiety are discussed. While these are commonly perceived as negative experiences in conflict situations, they are normalized in our conversation and linked to positive feelings of pride, confidence, persistence, and courage. 

00:25:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Now, at one point you talked about shaking before- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and at the same time you were proud- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
ADAM Yes. 

00:25:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL - you kinda, how you handled it. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ADAM Yes. Yeah. 

00:25:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Was it to that sense on that? (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
ADAM No, I, I was, I, I got in my car on the school that day- (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
ADAM - and I, I really felt disgraced and I was embarrassed, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. Even on the second time? 

00:25:40
ADAM  No, the second time- (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
ADAM - when I confronted the teacher, uhm, it was in a formal setting. The principal was there as a mediator. 

00:25:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
ADAM Uhm, and that time, you know, the confrontation shaking was, was there but I was, ah, confident that I was now, sort of, together with myself and I could handle this situation. I had spent four days thinking about it. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
ADAM So, I definitely had my preparation time. 

00:26:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, you had the first time with the person and that really left you shaky. 

00:26:10
ADAM Yeah. 

00:26:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL But then four days later, a lot of replay in between, thinking, sound of like a lot of almost studying(ph)-(crosstalk) 

00:26:15
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL - you and, what happened there. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ADAM Yeah. 

00:26:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL And on that occasion when you went back arguing that, that sound like that, that went- 

00:26:25
ADAM That went well. 

00:26:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL - much better for you. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
ADAM Yeah. I, I'm, I do not sit with a, with a straight back and,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah(ph). 

00:26:35
ADAM - when I was in that meeting, uhm, you know, I was still, sort of, hesitant and shy- (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
ADAM - uhm, expressing my feelings to her, uhm, emotionally and professionally about how the situation affected me. 

00:26:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
ADAM Uhm, and it was that I'm talking to this person that made me feel the way they did. That, sort of, brought back that the same sensations. (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
ADAM But I have the sense of pride when I left. 

00:26:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Oh. 

00:26:55
ADAM  So that was, that was there. 

00:27:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
ADAM Uhm. 

00:27:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL So how did, how even though, you know, it wasn't perfect by any means,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ADAM Hmm. 

00:27:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - you still left with that sense of- (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ADAM  Yeah. 

00:27:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - pride that you handle it the way you'd like to handle it. 

00:27:10
ADAM Yeah, it was sloppy but it got done. 

00:27:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:27:15
ADAM (laughs) Uhm. 

00:27:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL And how long did you process the second one? 

00:27:15
ADAM  I'm, I'm so processed. 

00:27:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
ADAM I, I mean,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:27:20
ADAM - it was, ah, it's a situation that took place in the school that I worked at- (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
ADAM - and I go to the school everyday, uhm, and I can honestly say I don't drive into the school grounds without thinking this is where it happened. 

00:27:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
ADAM Ah, it, it was almost like a trauma, you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Oh. 

00:27:35
ADAM  I almost think about it like that, uhm, but I, I still think about it, I still, you know, praise myself for- 

00:27:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
ADAM - sticking with it and telling people I'm right and I wish I had a more mature form to tell this teacher that. 

00:27:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
ADAM  Uhm. 

00:27:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, it really, a trauma almost in a sense of it, sort of like, not just shook you but it, sort of, shook you to- 

00:28:00
ADAM To the core. (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - almost the core. So, even right now it's still, as your perks(ph) at school, there's still a sense of mixed of(ph) anxiety or- (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
ADAM Yeah, this, I think anxiety is the good word(ph). 

00:28:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
ADAM  Uhm, 'coz definitely I've, I've, you know, feel the blood rush and my- (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
ADAM - palms get sweaty and, and I walk up and then I get out of the car. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
ADAM And I, sort of, try and detach from that because the situation was over. Ah, it's been addressed. 

00:28:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:28:30
ADAM Ah, I feel I addressed it the second time in a way so that if it came about with the same teacher, it wouldn't happen the same way. 

00:28:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:28:35
ADAM So that, it, it's more, well, this is where it, you know, the scene- (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
ADAM - where it happened. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. What have you learned about your strengths as a human being based on, on some ways the trauma and the second one- (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL - kinda over the short period of time, what have you learned about yourself. 

00:28:55
ADAM Ah, ah, I don't think I've learned anything really new about myself- (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay or (inaudible )- (crosstalk) 

00:29:03
ADAM - that, sort of, reinforced the fact that I, I don't quit, that I'm not a quitter. 

00:29:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Who initiated that second meeting? 

00:29:05
ADAM I did. 

00:29:05
Focus on client's strength 

00:29:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL So you came back at it even though it sound like it shook you to the core, you came back. 

00:29:10
ADAM  Yeah, yeah, uhm, this, this teacher, uhm, has done this, sort of, approach to other people- (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
ADAM - in the same manner she did to me and nobody had really pressed it beyond that. Ah, they told me and that, sort of, add it to my second meeting anxiety. I was the first one to formally, uhm, confront this teacher. 

00:29:40
Cheerleading 

00:29:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Congratulations. 

00:29:40
ADAM  Thank you. 

00:29:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Well I've heard Adam is that you've just also put it into a larger context. This is, that you weren't number one on that person's list. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
ADAM No. 

00:29:50
Stage 4: Exploring of Alternatives and Confronting Incongruities 

00:29:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Ah, but, it sounds like you're the first person to really, and here- (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
ADAM I'll not let her get away with it. 

00:30:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - not let her get away with it and also for being a new person in that social, in that situation. 

00:30:05
ADAM  Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Ah, that strikes me. I'm just, my own impression is this, that it takes a lot of guts for a new kid on the block to be able to stand up and to do that, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
ADAM Yeah, I, I think that, I, I think I took some courage. I mean, I, I definitely, the, the night before, right. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Let me make sure, my impression is I- (crosstalk) 

00:30:25
ADAM Right(ph). 

00:30:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL - think it took a lot of courage. 

00:30:25
ADAM Uh hmm. Thank you. Uhm, sure, I, uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Right. 

00:30:30
ADAM - say that sometimes I don't praise myself, uhm, but I've not. 

00:30:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Now, let me give you a permission to that more often especially given what you just- (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
ADAM (laughs) Okay. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - shown in that situation. 

00:30:40
ADAM I thought about the, the first event quite a bit over the weekend- 

00:30:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
ADAM - without thinking, "Hey, on Tuesday I'm, I'm gonna have to see her again." And Monday, I looked to my little appointment book and I saw eight o'clock meeting. 

00:30:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
ADAM And then I, sort of got this, the rush and definitely I, I'm gonna have to do this again. (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:31:00
ADAM And I think at that point, uhm, I, I've most definitely constantly saying to myself, "You can do this and you can go in- (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
ADAM - and you're right and, uhm, you let it get you once but you, you know you've done the right thing and you're taking the appropriate measures- (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
ADAM - and, and you can do this." 

00:31:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Got a lot of talk to yourself who've letting yourself know- 

00:31:25
ADAM Yeah. 

00:31:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL - I'm on the right track. (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
ADAM Yeah. And then I went in and, and I said my piece and- (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:30
ADAM - she actually, ah, argue with me a little bit. It was not at the tone of voice that she had the week before. 

00:31:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
ADAM It was very civilized, uhm, but she argued with me and she told me, honestly,- (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
ADAM - she disagreed with how I- (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
ADAM - handled the situation. 

00:31:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:45
ADAM And, ah, I told likewise to her- 

00:31:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:31:50
ADAM - and, uhm, told her how I wish the situation had resolved itself- (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
ADAM - and how I would like it to resolve itself in the future and then I got up and I left. 

00:31:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL  It sounds almost like, ah, pages straight out of an Assertiveness Training Manual. 

00:32:00
ADAM Oh. (laughs) I wish I had seen that page beforehand. 

00:32:05
Stage 5: Generalizations to Daily Life 

00:32:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL  In this segment, I changed the focus to help Adam place his conflict within a larger context. In addition, I refrain his behavior in this larger context. Adam proceeds to move from his perception of being a victim who is humiliated and disgraced to a leader. He states that he did what others would like him to have done and I reinforced this new view with supportive comments. 

00:32:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Well, it sounds like it's almost the embodiment of- (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:32:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - you standing up for yourself but at the same time, I'm also hearing that not just Adam standing up for himself but in some ways, as almost a representative of many other people within that system- 

00:32:50
ADAM Yeah. 

00:32:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL - ah, who have maybe been on the receiving end of the same type of thing, uhm, that's almost as our model for, this is a way that we might go, by handling these types of situations. (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
ADAM Yeah. It was important to me that, uhm, though it very well could happen again, that I at least did what I could to make sure it didn't. 

00:33:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
ADAM And as I understood the policies of the school, ah, you have to start somewhere and not maybe at the first, and it may take five or six or seven, sort of, formal, not complaints but- (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
ADAM - inquiries of, to her behavior but that, uhm, the one closer to getting to that point. (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
Accent on positive 

00:33:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL So, you acted in some ways ah, I'll use the word on your own conscience- 

00:33:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:33:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - of what you thought had to be done- 

00:33:40
ADAM  Yeah. 

00:33:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - ah, you got knocked off in a traumatic, sort of a way initially,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - uhm, but I guess I'm also hearing this is at four days later, talk about recovery skills- 

00:33:55
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and that you came back, handled it in the way, maybe it's a little sloppy as you said,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
ADAM Yeah. 

00:34:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - but on the other hand, uhm, you came out having some pride in yourself of what you're able to do. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
ADAM I feel it. 

00:34:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Notice the transition that Adam makes as the session proceeds from hereon. He describes being taken off-guard as interesting and even an enjoyable challenge. I amplified this transition by labeling his response of being taken off-guard as recovery skills, implying that he possesses these skills. Adam accepts this framework and labels recovery as an issue of response time rather than a lack of skills. Adam's change in language indicates a transition from the status of victim in the professional and personal conflict to that of a person having skills that maybe polished with practice. 

00:34:40
ADAM The, there are positives and negatives to every situation and,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
ADAM - and I definitely believe that there are no negative learning situations- (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
ADAM - anything you learned from there's a positive thing. (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
ADAM Uhm, you know, I'd, I'd say on one hand that I wish I had handled the situations so a second meeting would not have been needed. 

00:35:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:35:00
ADAM But had that, had I done that, uhm, she really, she would've gotten away with it and it wouldn't have been brought up. 

00:35:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
ADAM Then she would've done this to somebody- (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:35:10
ADAM - else who may have let it go. So in a way, that was, ah. 

00:35:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Looking ahead, if it were necessary, raise your anxiety here a minute,- (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
ADAM Hmm. 

00:35:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL - how would you handle the third meeting and what did you learn from the first and second that would even make it, in this case, maybe even less sloppy. 

00:35:25
ADAM I think, the third meeting would be very similar to the second one. Maybe with a little less nervousness and anxiety having repeated this- (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
ADAM - several times. 

00:35:35
Reframe of client's experience 

00:35:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL So the second one,- (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
ADAM (Sniffs) 

00:35:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - you'd talked early about kind of a message from childhood of respect. 

00:35:45
ADAM Hmm. 

00:35:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL For people who are older, adults and so on, ah, it sounds like on that second one then, you were able on the one hand to show the respect and also to stand up for yourself. 

00:35:55
ADAM Hmm. Well, on the second one I think it was a little different because she had calm down a little bit also, uhm, that we were almost treating each other with a little bit more mutual respect- (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
ADAM - than the first one where it was completely degrading to me, I thought. (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
ADAM  And so, uhm, I did more like, to convey the, the sense that I, I do have respect for her as a teacher- (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:36:25
ADAM - and as an elder but that, uhm, you know, and, and part of it was, it was part of that age difference but, ah, I'm not qualified to tell you that you were inappropriate in your behavior. 

00:36:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
ADAM Uhm, and so part of that was, sort of, overcoming that and I think having gotten(ph) and sat down in that second meeting and actually successfully done that. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
ADAM I could, I could go into that again. 

00:36:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. So, a real challenge that you encountered right at the beginning in some ways of a professional career here. 

00:36:55
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uhm. 

00:36:55
ADAM And a good learning experience. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
Change of focus to explore how client seeks others for support 

00:36:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL A good learning experience, ah, and you sought out. It sounds like not just yourself in terms of replaying that but you talked with other people. 

00:37:05
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL You somehow brought in others to be able to not just doing it all inside- (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
ADAM Yeah. 

00:37:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - yourself but a confirmation that's, "Hey, am I on the right track?" So that there's, ah, environment out there that you listen to. (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
ADAM Yeah. Yeah, I, I definitely like the support of, not even the support, if I was wrong, people I asked would have said,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
ADAM - "You were wrong," and then I would have gone to you and say, "I apologize." 

00:37:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
ADAM Uhm, but at least to get feedback from different perspectives- 

00:37:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
ADAM - and those perspectives would've changed how I will play- (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
ADAM - the future situation. 

00:37:35
ADAM So, a real willingness to also seek out in that environment there, other people's in,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - input, ah, as a way of, it's not just I run the movies and- 

00:37:45
ADAM Right. 

00:37:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - play the scenes myself but, ah, to get new input too. 

00:37:45
ADAM  Yeah. 

00:37:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL When working with highly verbal clients, it is helpful to refocus on what works. This assists the client to maintain a focus on exceptions, to the problem situations and also a focus on their resources for addressing problems. Thus, in preparing to close the session, I asked two questions that emphasize a brief response. 

00:38:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL As we bring this to a close- (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - uhm, what have we not covered that might be relevant here. And the second question would be, based on what we've been talking about, I've been really impressed with how you bounced back from that situation, where are other places in your life, without going in a detail, that this, this kind of resiliency, this bouncing back like, recovery skills, where would those be, where might those be appropriate? 

00:38:40
ADAM  I think the, uhm, what we haven't talked about, uhm, might be my physical reaction during that first incident and how that might be controlled in the future. 

00:39:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Do you have- (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
ADAM Uhm. 

00:39:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - some clues on the physical parts? 

00:39:05
ADAM Ah, I, I think the physical came from that the anxiety, the instant anxiety- (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
ADAM - on the stress that came from being taken off-guard but being taken off-guard in a very confrontational authoritative way. 

00:39:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
ADAM Uhm, and, you know, I, I don't know of relaxation techniques, on the spot relaxation techniques would have done anything. 

00:39:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:39:25
ADAM  Ah, I certainly wasn't gonna close my eyes and deep breath and count to ten when she- (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
ADAM - was yelling like that. But, uhm, some, sort of, inner mechanism- (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
ADAM - control device just to calm down and getting control of senses and then start anew. 

00:39:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
ADAM Uhm, but, all right. I think we definitely covered. 

00:39:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Based on all the skills that you've- 

00:39:55
ADAM (Sniffs) 

00:39:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - had in your repertoire would- (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
ADAM Hmm. 

00:39:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - also been using within those four days and as you recovers, recovery skills and so on, where in other areas of your life might this be useful. 

00:40:10
ADAM I think I'll use them again in, in my professional work ethic. 

00:40:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:40:10
ADAM Uhm, you know, the, the not quitting and, and believing in yourself and, uhm, staying with it. 

00:40:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
ADAM I, I definitely take from this and I apply it, uhm, everyday. And as we have talked about earlier that there are moments when I do not have this problem in a confrontation situation- (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
ADAM - and that, you know, there are exceptions and -(crosstalk) 

00:40:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:40:35
ADAM - I'm acknowledging those exceptions as, as healthy. 

00:40:35
Summary 

00:40:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL I have been privileged to, in talking with you here today of exploring, the case rather, sort of, double whammy type of situation- (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL - that you got, sort of, not very well loop(ph) kind of almost to your core. 

00:40:55
ADAM Yeah. 

00:40:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Ah, I guess what strikes me is how fast the recovery was given- (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL - somehow the, how much that knocked you- (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
ADAM Yeah. 

00:41:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL - and that you do, I mean, getting the examples of also how you drawn, I think, there's, that's something that you drawn, ah, that's real basic of who you are- (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
ADAM Hmm. 

00:41:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL - from understanding this that, ah, there's a sense of my personhood, ah, my sense of who I am, ah, that can't be violated and that I will speak up and say something and not only that but in this particular situation. It sounds like you not only stood up for yourself but it sounds like you stood up in some ways for other people, uhm, champing(ph) up- (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
ADAM Uh-huh. 

00:41:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - them in that particular ah, school. 

00:41:45
ADAM That was kinda helpful for me. 

00:41:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
ADAM Sort of, include others in a, in a sort of, a problem greater than myself. 

00:41:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
ADAM Added a different degree of responsibility. 

00:41:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
Post-session Processing 

00:41:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL  I had in mind be interested in your perceptions of what worked for you in this interview. Also, there are things that weren't working for you,- (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
ADAM Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - uhm, and any just sort of, general impressions that you had. 

00:42:15
ADAM Uh hmm. I found the, ah, the interview really interesting. Uhm, I was surprised, ah, right at the beginning that we didn't go right into the conflict. 

00:42:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
ADAM Uhm, I've, sort of, really enjoyed ta-, starting it on a, on a positive note and heading an example of, uhm, where I didn't have the problem that had happened- (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
ADAM - the week before. 

00:42:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Okay. 

00:42:40
ADAM And that, sort of, ah, you know, it's nice to go into a sense of pride and then take that sense of pride into the problem area- (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
ADAM - that you're talking about. Uhm. 

00:42:50
JOHN M. LITTRELL Well, I did notice that you looked a little surprise that we- 

00:42:50
ADAM  Yeah. 

00:42:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL - didn't like we're going into problem talking. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
ADAM I, I instinctively was, was ready to go right into the, the meat and bones of the problem 

00:43:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:00
ADAM Uhm, and I, I enjoyed talking about something pleasant, to start out with. 

00:43:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL It's also where are you successful, where are your resources,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
ADAM Yeah. 

00:43:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL - what are your strengths, uhm. 

00:43:15
ADAM Yeah. And, and then use those when you talk about the problem. 

00:43:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:15
ADAM  Uhm, it was great 'coz it helped you kept those resources in my mind so that I could draw 'em again when I was thinking about the other incident. 

00:43:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
ADAM Uhm, and I also was intrigued and I enjoyed talking about the problem without going into the step-by-step play of, of what actually happened and would had said what- (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ADAM - and how I responded and et cetera, had I gone into what actually happened fact-by, by fact. Uhm, you know that, what have caused the same anxiety in me again and- (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
ADAM - uhm, it, it was nice to, to talk about the issue without talking about the details of that issue. 

00:44:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. And you're again part of that is this that I'm well aware that you know all the details- (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
ADAM Hmm. 

00:44:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL -of that. I also make the assumption, I don't need to know all of those details to be able to look at, uhm, what possible solutions are for you. 

00:44:15
ADAM Yeah and that's, I think that's, ah, an, an incredibly powerful thing to, to do is to ah, to not to need to know all the details of, of the issue. 

00:44:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
ADAM And still effectively deal with the issue. 

00:44:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL  Any thing surprise you? 

00:44:35
ADAM Uhm, I think when I think about that issu-, that event and the, the subsequent events after the second meeting, ah, and, sort of, put it in the systemic concept of my life, ah, that is, you know, another chapter. It was very interesting to look at it. Uhm, over the weekend when I was thinking about it, I was really concentrating on the role playing and, ah, how would I have handled it differently and how I'm gonna handle the second meeting- 

00:45:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ADAM - without really going into, well I've done it right before so I, I should just carry that with, you know, I was really thinking very event specific. 

00:45:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:45:15
ADAM Uhm, and not bringing out positive really from, from the others. (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:45:20
ADAM I mean, I knew I was encouraging myself, "You're strong enough to do this and you know that you're right and I will go over and(ph) make sure that I was right." 

00:45:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:25
ADAM But I didn't bring the issue of my landlord. I don't think about that when I was going through it. Another example is when I did stand up. 

00:45:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
ADAM Uhm, so that was very good. 

00:45:35
JOHN M. LITTRELL I suspect that you also have become a role model for some of the older adults in that system- 

00:45:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:45:40
JOHN M. LITTRELL - even as you, ah, had those two, ah, meetings of that person. 

00:45:50
ADAM Yeah, there were other teachers that had, ah, come up to me. Ah, maybe some, you know, half a dozen, I think and they had said, "So, I heard you had a ah, you know, so and so incident,"- (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
ADAM - referring to the fact that it had happened before. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:46:00
ADAM And I said, "Yeah." And they said, "We heard what you have done. That was, that was good." And my supervisor had praised me many times- (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
ADAM - and that was very strong and, and it, it didn't go unnoticed that, you know, nobody had done this before. 

00:46:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL And what would you had me do differently? 

00:46:20
ADAM By never having done this before, I don't think ah, I did do anything differently. I, I really like the flow and the pace of it. 

00:46:25
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
ADAM  Uhm, I, I like starting from a point that was not in, in the heat, in the moment.

JOHN M. LITTRELL Sometimes they have referred to, sometimes brief counseling doesn't somehow get the feelings and yet, ah, you seem to have a variety of feelings even as we're sitting here- 

00:46:45
ADAM Yeah. 

00:46:45
JOHN M. LITTRELL - talking during that session. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ADAM Yeah, my, my understanding of, of brief counseling is very goal-oriented. Once the problem has surfaced, uhm, and I, I can't bring goals into a discussion without bringing feelings- 

00:47:00
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:47:00
ADAM - in there as well and I think they go hand in hand. (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah. I do too. 

00:47:05
ADAM And, uhm, I think when we're talking that the, you know, we didn't specifically say what are the goals of the future but they were,- (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm.

00:47:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL Yeah.

00:47:20
ADAM Yeah. 

00:47:20
JOHN M. LITTRELL - but, ah, it seem like you had some once(ph) in mind here. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
ADAM Yeah, but, the, the, the essence of creating the goals I think was, was there on our conversation. 

00:47:30
JOHN M. LITTRELL Uh hmm. Thank you again.

ADAM Thank you again. It was a pleasure.

JOHN M. LITTRELL In summary, brief counseling focuses on client's strengths and resources. What they want and how to get there. I find the conceptualizing the skills of brief counseling using a micro-counseling framework makes these skills easier to learn. I wish you the best as you increase your counseling repertoire by blending these two powerful tools. Those interested on additional information about brief counseling, may consider purchasing a copy of John Littrel's book, "Brief Counseling in Action" available on www.Amazon.com.
