Guided Work Period and Goal Setting 

00:00:05
Lizzy Krueger Science Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:00:40
LIZZY KRUEGER We have had GWP, guided work period, as one of our ways to support kids academically. 

00:00:45
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:00:50
BRANDON HAMLETT Guided work period, which is once a week and it's just a period where they get to come in and work on any type of homework or any type of research. 

00:00:55
LIZZY KRUEGER Guided work period time for me is a time when I can really meet with students individually and find out what is- what's holding them up in the academic process. And it's nice because I know them as people, so since I know them through advisory and through gatherings and through all of our rituals and routines we do together, they know that I'm trying to help them academically; not come down on them or punish them. 

00:01:15
Carlos 

00:01:20
CARLOS We, we stay more organized. We have all our things in one place. We keep, like, trackers and stuff of our grades. We get our grades. We receive feedback. We fill out reflections; so we're all on track to, like, success.

Manual High School Denver, 9th Grade Advisory 

00:01:30
MARY PISHNEY Welcome, welcome; do you guys have your stuff? Kristen (ph), you got your stuff? Hustle ladies; let's go. Okay, do you have your stuff? Grab your folder. 

00:01:40
Mary Pishney Math Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 9th Grade Advisory 

00:01:45
All right, guys; so everyone should have brought work to work on today for GWP. Remember inside your trackers, you'll find your GWP tracker. Before you get started on your assignment, if you all could take a second and fill out uh, your tracker for this period. Make sure you estimate how long each task is gonna take you and then when you finish it, either write completed or if you're not quite done yet, write not completed. Um, in just second I'll be around to um, speak with you individually and then hold some conferences. But before we do that, let's just do an overview. 

00:02:10
How many people by a show of hands, need to work on Miss Krueger's science project? Okay, so we've got a couple people working on that. Um, does anyone need to finish math homework that was assigned today? Okay. What's going on in English? Somebody update me on what's happening in English. Deidre (ph)? 

00:02:25
DEIDRE We have to Cornell note our, um, paper what we did notes on. 

00:02:30
MARY PISHNY Okay. Does somebody want to add to that? Is there anything else going on in English? Carlos? 

00:02:35
CARLOS We have to, we have to reflect on the progress we wrote for Miss Martin (ph). 

00:02:40
MARY PISHNY All right; so we know what we've got going on in science. We've got our science projects, math homework and English; and just to-- is everyone comfortable with that? Okay. In just a second, I'm gonna come around and conference with you and just get an update on how you guys are doing right now. Sound good? All right; let's go. 

00:03:00
Okay, let's start with you. Give me a quick overview. How is everything going? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN It's going pretty good. 

00:03:05
MARY PISHNY Good? Can you tell me one thing that's going really well right now? It can be in school, out of school. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN Math. 

00:03:10
MARY PISHNY Math? Tell me more. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN Well, like all the things have actually gotten a little bit harder, still able to get--to keep getting what I (inaudible ). 

00:03:20
LIZZY KRUEGER We have really silent guided work periods and during those I can go around and I can meet with each student and it really gives me more of a sense of who's struggling with what part of studying. So beyond just content, it's like okay, student A is really not time managing. She's been on this one subject for a really long time. How can we get her to understand that she needs to move through one thing to get to the next? Student B might be overwhelmed and so maybe they have too much homework and they can't prioritize. They don't know where to start and that's leading to procrastination. 

00:03:55
MARY PISHNY Carlos, do you mind if we talk real quick? 

00:04:00
CARLOS No. 

00:04:00
MARY PISHNY Sounds great. All right, Carlos; start me off with something good. What's going well in your life right now? 

00:04:05
CARLOS My grades. 

00:04:05
MARY PISHNY Grades? Tell me more about that. In all of your classes? 

00:04:10
CARLOS I have one C in all my classes. That's all. 

00:04:15
MARY PISHNY Okay. Um, why do think your grades are so great right now? 

00:04:15
"...cause I actually did my homework this trimester." 

00:04:15
CARLOS Cuz I actually did my homework this trimester. 

00:04:20
MARY PISHNEY Hmm.

00:04:20
BRANDON HAMLETT GWP, everyone, GWP. Lionel (ph), do you have GWP stuff? All right; very good. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Can we go in now? 

00:04:30
BRANDON HAMLETT Yeah, I think you can. GWP; do you got GWP stuff? 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:35
BRANDON HAMLETT All right; very good. How are you doing, sir? 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN Very good. 

00:04:35
BRANDON HAMLETT Good to see you. 

00:04:35

00:04:35
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:04:45
Okay guys; obviously, GWP today. Hello. How are you? Um, McKenna (ph) and Bree (ph) can you guys please get started on your work? 

00:05:00
Last year my guided work period was very teacher guided. Working our way into a strong guided work period, I felt like it was- I had to be really on task, moving around the room and we did a lot of checking in with students- what do you have to work on? What are working on now? Where do you plan to be with this? What's going on with these certain classes to help improve your grades? 

00:05:20
Brandon Hamlett Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:05:20
I had a seating chart as well, so it was just like- you have to sit in these certain places. There's no talking. It was a very quiet room and the rules were very strict. As we moved on to their senior year, it became more of- you guys are about to be in college and you need to start taking control of your own futures, control of your own education. So starting with this year, I, I basically gave them that message and said, " I am not going to babysit you as seniors. If you haven't figured by now, then we failed you." And it became more of- they come in, they know they have to work, they know they need to bring homework and they know this is their one chance to really get some work done for the week and it became a student-guided work period. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:15
BRANDON HAMLESS How are you? 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Good 

00:06:15
Mariah 

00:06:15
MARIAH I help a lot of people and I feel good about it because I get to make sure that I'm not only passing my classes, but everyone in my advisory, everyone that I am close to is getting their grades up. 

00:06:25
Carlos 

00:06:30
CARLOS We go to GWP, which is guided work period and we, we do more work that helps us raise our grade or resubmit assignments 

00:06:35
Jessica 

00:06:35
JESSICA Your advisor; she's just like, gonna push you. She's gonna ask you to do good in school and she's gonna ask how your classes are going, what are your grades? She's just gonna keep you on track. 

00:06:45
CARLOS We receive our grades every Monday. Our advisor has us reflect on those grades and asks us what we can do better to change them or get them higher or whatever, bring them up from where they're at. 

00:06:55
Lizzy Krueger Science Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:06:55
LIZZY KRUEGER Sometimes guided work period will be the first time or the only time that kids actually can complete a homework assignment, um and see it through from start to finish and feel that sense of accomplishment. 

00:07:05
JESSICA My advisory does make me feel like why did I come to school? Because I know I have a certain group of people that supports each other. 

00:07:15
Francisco 

00:07:15
"At the beginning of this year," 

00:07:15
"I came to school and I didn't feel..." 

00:07:15
"like I didn't want to be in school no more." 

00:07:15
"And in my advisory, I went and..." 

00:07:15
"talked to my advisory." 

00:07:15
"...saying I don't want to be in school no more." 

00:07:15
"And my advisor gave me the support to stay in school," 

00:07:15
"and he helped me stay in school." 

00:07:15
FRANCISCO At the beginning of this year, I came to school and I didn't feel like I wanted to be in school no more and in my advisory I went and talked to my advisory and said "I don't want to be in school no more." And my advisor gave me the support to stay in school and he helped me stay in school.

Isaiah 

00:08:30
ISAIAH When the other kids in my advisory, when they see me, you know, not doing well in one course, you know, they're pushing me to do better. That shows that they care about me. So, if they show that they care about me, I should care just as much of my education and I, you know, push myself even harder for the advisory and for myself. 

00:08:45
Carolynn 

00:08:50
CAROLYNN When my grades started slipping because I'd been absent for awhile, my advisors and my, my peers in advisory were the ones to push me to help me out so that I could get my grades up so I could keep passing.

ELLEN FLANAGAN Hi, guys. Good afternoon. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Good afternoon. 

00:09:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN Nice seeing you, Hal. Hi, Andrea (ph); hey Valerie (ph); great seeing you. Hey Gab (ph). 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:09:15
ELLEN FLANAGAN Juan, how's the day so far? 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Good afternoon. 

00:09:15
Ellen FlanaganHey Bianca. 

00:09:15
Ellen Flanagan South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:09:15
So today, I know you guys just got your report cards. I know you haven't seen them yet, so we want to do our usual academicals setting when we get our report cards. So the first thing I want you to do; I'm going to hand out your report cards. I want you to just look at them for a second. You can see on the agenda over here that we're gonna talk a little bit about what are the successes? What are the assets? And you're gonna star those classes in which you had an asset that you felt really good. So similar to what Lionel (ph) was just saying where he had a check, plus, plus; those are the things that make us feel good that we want to share those. 

00:09:50
And then you're gonna put a check next to a thing that's a challenge to you. Then we're going to go into our goal setting, which we've done lots and lots of times. How are we going to create some goals for those classes that are challenges for us? And again, I want to remind us- we have to be specific in creating our goals. What's the what? What are we going to do? And more importantly, how are we going to do it? 

00:10:15
And then finally, we're just gonna close and you're gonna share out some of those goals. 

00:10:15
Terry Quiros Counselor, South Bronx Preparatory: A College Board School, NYC 

00:10:20
TERRY QUIROS We include academic advisement in every marking period, at least two advisory sessions. Students are given their report cards. They- um- they do individual academic conferencing and then there are advisors that are more comfortable with group academic conferencing, which is another beautiful thing about advisory. When you've got enough safety in a room for all students to look at each other's work and then support each other. 

00:10:50
ELLEN FLANAGAN So I'm gonna also hand out your reflection sheet. I know you've seen this sheet before. It's something we use often as far as when we're setting our goals. So I want you to take a minute to really think about why you were successful. 

00:10:55
[sil.] 

00:10:55
Bianca 

00:11:05
BIANCA The activity that we did today helped because it makes you process each and every thing that you do and what's wrong and what's right, like when you realize- oh, I failed a class. It's like- this is what I need to do. This is what I've been doing. Have I been sitting in the back? I need to sit in the front or I need to stop talking to my friends and I need to start paying attention and start taking notes. And then you realize, if you're getting a high grade, the techniques that you're doing is working. If you're failing a class or you're not coming to school on time or if you're just late, always late, she must-- like, my advisor, she comes- you have to be on time. You have to listen and when you have your advisees in class with you, they're on point and they tell you, "This is what you need to do. You have to come to class." 

00:11:45
ELLEN FLANAGAN Is everyone finished with that? Can we share out why we were successful? Okay. I see lots of great writing here. So who wants to start? 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Um, my biggest asset was in English. I got an 87 this marker period and last marker period I failed with this 55 and I failed because I wasn't doing the essays. I did horrible on the vocabulary tests. 

00:12:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN So I think it's great. I mean you went from a 55 to an 87 and you've already started to think about what things you did to make that success happen. So I love the way you're already thinking ahead of time. Carlos, you're up. 

00:12:25
CARLOS Um, I improved in chemistry because last marker period I had a 77 and that's probably because I was sitting in the back. But this marker period I had a 90 so I changed my seat to see how it was going to be different. So I started listening to her and then I actually learned the subject even better sitting in the front. 

00:12:40
ELLEN FLANAGAN And how about the last person? Lionel (ph), could you round us out, please? 

00:12:45
LIONEL Um, I think I did better because um, I started, I started asking more questions. Like back then I would just put my head down and not pay attention and I now I do pay attention and take all my notes. 

00:12:55
ELLEN FLANAGAN Yeah, so things like just one focusing in; so taking notes, asking more questions, being more actively engaged are all things you've talked about that you've seen the payoff in. 

00:13:05
LIONEL Yeah. 

00:13:05
ELLEN FLANAGAN Really great. Now I want you to look at and put a check and we'll do quick go around, um, on those classes that you did not do well. So instead of getting overwhelmed with all of those classes that we didn't do well in, I want you to really focus in on one class. I want you to be really specific on why you, not everyone else but why you did not do well. And then we're gonna move on to that goal setting. 

00:13:30
High school comes and I've got all these different things. I've got credits. I have different tests I need to take and it can be a bit overwhelming. So getting into the habits of mine and getting into the rituals of assessing themselves as learners and really establishing goals and really being concrete about what that means. Cuz lots of times we say, "Oh, do that better." And they don't know how to do it better. 

00:13:55
What did you choose, Andrea (ph)? 

00:13:55
ANDREA Chemistry. 

00:13:55
ELLEN FLANAGAN Hmm. So talk to me about that. 

00:14:00
ANDREA Um, I took a loud class and I didn't hand in, um, my lab reports, so it went down. 

00:14:05
ELLEN FLANAGAN Okay, so who did you hear share out earlier about why they did well in that, in that same course and what they did? 

00:14:10
ANDREA Bianca. 

00:14:10
ELLEN FLANAGAN What did she say? 

00:14:15
ANDREA That she goes after school so I'm gonna start going after school for her class. 

00:14:20
ELLEN FLANAGAN Okay. Bianca, what do you think you could do to maybe help Andrea? 

00:14:20
BIANCA I guess we could go to after school together- Tuesday to Thursday. 

00:14:25
ELLEN FLANAGAN What do you think? 

00:14:30
ANDREA Tuesdays 

00:14:30
ELLEN FLANAGAN You can go Tuesdays? 

00:14:30
ANDREA Yeah. 

00:14:30
ELLEN FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:14:30
It looks like everyone is done with their goal setting. Um, who wants to begin and share their really specific, right- the what and the how and maybe the when? So we've come up with a couple whens. Who wants to start? Who has a really specific plan? 

00:14:45
ISAIAH I'll start. 

00:14:50
ELLEN FLANAGAN Isaiah, twice starting today, thank you. 

00:14:50
ISAIAH Um, my biggest challenge was my AP psychology class. Um, it's a college-level class so it requires a lot of work. Um, you have to do a lot of studying and really take good notes. Um, I take good notes, I just don't have good study habits. So- 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN You should start reading the book. 

00:15:10
ISAIAH Yeah, that's one of the things; I don't read the book. I have bad study habits. I have a 55 last marker period and this marker period I got a 65 because I didn't turn in one of the big projects. So some goal is to start studying more, get the projects in and really take, like, good notes and keep taking good notes to get this grade up because a 65 isn't good enough. 

00:15:35
ELLEN FLANAGAN Who else has a- something that they want to share? I know everyone has shared but can we get one more person to share out? Lionel? 

00:15:40
LIONEL I put down (inaudible[0015:43]) because I got a 65, but I'm, I started doing my work and pass all my tests, cuz back then I, I didn't used to take notes like that, and now I need to start taking notes and pass and study for the test. 

00:15:55
ELLEN FLANAGAN So you started off really well. I want you to think about what happened to make you not do that. 

00:16:00
LIONEL I don't know. I just- I think I just got lazy. 

00:16:05
ELLEN FLANAGAN So we've been there before. I'm gonna push you. What specifically are you gonna do? 

00:16:10
LIONEL I'm gonna study for the tests and start doing my homework cuz I'm missing a lot of homework and that's it. 

00:16:15
ELLEN FLANAGAN When are you gonna do that? 

00:16:20
LIONEL I'm gonna ask her today, what homeworks am I missing and what are the tests and (inaudible ) study? 

00:16:27
ELLEN FLANAGAN Okay, so Lionel has made a commitment that he's going to do that today. Who's gonna back him up on that commitment? 

00:16:30
ROGER I will, cuz I failed the class as well as he did, but I need help in, in her class because some of her projects I'm struggling with and I need help in her class as well. 

00:16:40
ELLEN FLANAGAN Okay. So where are you guys going to meet up after school? 

00:16:45
LIONEL I guess right there in front of her room. 

00:16:50
ELLEN FLANAGAN All right. So that sounds like a plan. Thanks, guys and I loved how you stepped up to that. So I want you to commit to something on a post-it and use those words- I commit to-. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:10
I commit to; have a great day everyone. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN You too, Miss Flanagan. 

00:17:15
ELLEN FLANAGAN Thank you. Thanks, Carlos. Thanks, Val. Thanks, Lionel. Thanks, Roger (ph). 

00:17:20
I think the thing that makes me most proud is the ownership between each other, the idea that Roger, who's also failing stepped right up and was like, " I'm gonna go and I'm gonna meet you." And they had a plan because I'm also failing. Cuz lots of times when we're not doing well, it can feel really isolating. So I love the idea that they are committed to each other's successes. 

00:17:40
Carolynn 

00:17:40
CAROLYNN Sometimes, like high school gets really touch so you kind of need that extra back up sometimes, from like, your teachers and your peers in advisory to kind of keep you going. 

00:17:45
Rene 

00:17:50
RENE Before I got to high school, I was like, struggling a lot with schoolwork and also I didn't care that much about school. I've been student of the month, got to the honor roll, um, been going on trips and these are rewards that I get out of all my work that I've done and I like that about my advisory. It's given me, given me like, the passion and the spirit to, to do something right in school.

00:19:30
Joseph Kanke English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:19:30
JOSEPH KANKE In the past, when I asked why they had those grades, as freshmen especially, they'd say, "I don't know." So I don't think I get that response any- at all anymore. They always have ideas in the back their minds of what led them to get those grades. I guess that goes back to, um, ownership. I keep using that word, but they're starting to realize that what they are doing affects their grades and they can create their own plan. 

00:19:55
CHARLIE SMITH The kind of questions that I ask student are kind of questions that, that put the ownership of what they're doing in their hands. 

00:20:00
Usbaldo 

00:20:00
USBALDO Like, why is it that your grade is lower? Is it homework? Is it attendance? He asks us, so we like, we analyze it and then we just-- like we think for ourselves, like we come up with our own solution. 

00:20:10
Dominique 

00:20:10
DOMINIQUE We set goals, like if our, if our grades has went down or went up; what did we do differently that week? What did we do differently and why-- if it went down, why did it go down? Are you turning in your work? Are you going to class? Why is this down? You know, we set a goal for the next week and then we reflect back upon it and see if we did anything.

Joseph Kanke , Lanier HS, Austin Step 1: Personal Check-in 

00:21:25
USBALDO Man, it's hard but it's all right; it's going good. 

00:21:25
JOSEPH KANKE How long have you been there now? 

00:21:30
USBALDO Um, probably about three weeks now (inaudible ). 

00:21:31
JOSEPH KANKE (crosstalk) Three weeks? 

00:21:31
USBALDO Yeah, pretty much three weeks, yeah. 

00:21:31
JOSEPH KANKE So the- the new cell phone; was that from the fruits of your labor? 

00:21:35
USBALDO Yep, I got paid yesterday. 

00:21:35
JOSEPH KANKE Yeah, that's a good feeling. 

00:21:35
USBALDO Yeah, I'm still saving though. I'm trying to get a car. 

00:21:40
JOSEPH KANKE Yeah, what car? Are you still looking at that one car you were talking about? 

00:21:45
USBALDO Nah, not really; too much gas. It's a V8. 

00:21:45
JOSEPH KANKE (crosstalk) Yeah, it's something to consider. 

00:21:45
Usbaldo 

00:21:50
USBALDO Like he's just involved, like with us in our lives and stuff and not, not like too personal or nothing; but he does it to where he can help us with our school, with our career. And like, and like I have a job; I work after school and he's always asking me, "How's the job going? How is it for you? Do you like it there?" And like, he's just concerned for me, you know?

One-to-One Conferencing 

00:22:10
Step 2: Positives First 

00:22:10
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay, what I'd like to do today; we're gonna be setting a goal. So I wanted you to take a look at all of these class that you're taking right now. 

00:22:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:22:20
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay? And we're going to look at class currently that you are feeling- you know what, I'm strong in this class, I'm doing really well and I'm learning some important information. Think about that. Which is a class in there? 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Hmm- I'd say principles (Inaudible ) 

00:22:40
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Principles? Okay. Talk a little bit about what's going well in there for you and what you're doing to make it go well. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. Um, well first off I- most of the six weeks I made most outstanding student and the class is really easy for me. I get really good grades in there. Um, I think it, like the class inspires me and like, I think about my future and I don't know; I just really like it. It has like, a lot of fun activities like hands-on projects, not just like boring class work (inaudible[00.23:12]). 

00:23:10
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Okay, so it's inspirational and it has a lot of experiential hands-on kinds of things that you're doing. What are you doing specifically to do well in there? What are some strategies you use in that class to do well? 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Like I said, it inspires me so like I think like, about myself and how I want to do and like it pushes me to like, in my head I tell myself you can do this, like, and you want good grades in this class because you like it. I don't know, like- 

00:23:40
MICHELE TISSIERE You're self-motivated. 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:23:45
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah, there's a lot of self motivation. 

00:23:45
Brenda Porta, Lanier HS, Austin Step 2: Positives First 

00:23:45
BRENDA PORTA All right; so let's take a minute and let's look at your grades. What I want you to do is look at the one class that you feel you're strongest at. 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN I want to say, algebra. 

00:23:55
BRENDA PORTA Algebra? Why? 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Because it's just like really- I learn a lot and I struggle most of the time in there, but I can actually- you know once I, if I'm struggling, once I get it, I feel so, you know, proud of myself; since I know it I'm like yes, I did it. 

00:24:15
BRENDA PORTA And what kind of things do you do to understand that? 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN I pay really, really good attention to the teacher. 

00:24:25
BRENDA PORTA Okay. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN And it's hard because I am sitting right next to my friends and there's just like- I want to talk to you all and I want to be texting and I want to be like, over here distracted. But once I see that it's hard, I, I just turn around, focus on the teacher and if I see the answer, I try to see how he got it. 

00:24:45
BRENDA PORTA Okay. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Not just like- sometimes I ask, but most of the times I just want to do it by myself; try to figure it out. 

00:24:55
BRENDA PORTA (crosstalk) Very good. Awesome. So being focused and paying attention is very important for you. 

00:25:00
One-to-One Conferencing 

00:25:00
Step 3: Problem Identified 

00:25:00
Michele Tissiere, ESR Facilitator Step 3: Problem Identified 

00:25:00
MICHELE TISSIERE Think about a class down here that is presenting you with some challenge right now. It might be one or two classes, but identify a class where you know what? There's some challenges in this class and I'm wanting to tackle those. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN Mm, It has to be French II 

00:25:15
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay. Do you mind if I take some notes? I want to chart what we've, what we're talking about, okay so French II. What's getting- what are some of the obstacles in French II that are creating challenges? 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Well, I took French in middle school and the class I have- this might not be an excuse, but the class I had was kind of like rambunctious and I didn't have to pay attention and kind of goofed off a lot and like, that kind of distracted me from my work and sometimes I would goof off, goof off with them. 

00:25:45
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN I kind of understand the things we're learning in the class and I just kind of like slid down this semester a little bit. 

00:25:50
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay. So I want to reflect back something that I just heard which is you had class in French prior to this one and sometimes you weren't as focused in there because the class was kind of rowdy and chaotic and so you're thinking there might be a connection to this current class? 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:26:05
MICHELE TISSIERE Would you say you're struggling with some of the- with understanding some things in there? 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:26:10
MICHELE TISSIERE You know when I think about a French class for a foreign-language class, you have vocabulary, you have grammar, you have to do some writing, you have to do listening, you have to do speaking; what's- which pieces of the French class are kind of troubling? 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk)Mm-him, yes. Um, speaking a little bit cuz you're not sure, like how to say things. Um, vocabulary; there's a lot of it and it's kind of hard to remember sometimes. Um, I think that's it. 

00:26:35
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Okay. 

00:26:35
Joseph Kanke English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:26:35
JOSEPH KANKE So what I started with Freshman year was just to pick one class and one area and if they said, Um, "I don't know why I'm failing," even with that one class, that's where it becomes really important, I think, to get to know your kids and have a good rapport with them, because once you know a little bit about their lifestyle, you can offer suggestions. Um, well, I noticed that you've been hanging out with your girlfriend a lot or I noticed you've been getting to school late. It seems like you're sleeping a lot. What's going on there? So I think it really helps to develop a rapport with all your advisory students so that you can have something to build those open-ended questions off of. 

00:27:15
MICHELE TISSIERE We all have challenges in different ways, and certain classes will do that. So let's go to a class where you've had some challenge recently in the cycle six. And think about what's been challenging for you in there. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN Um, my U.S. History class because history, it's just facts. It's fact, after fact, after fact and you just have to memorize everything and learn it pretty much. But it's tough right now because of- I've missed several days in class so I'm kind of behind and also we're getting very close to taking our AP exam for it, so it's just like cramming time. It's, it's like you have to just get ready for the exam and it's- 

00:28:05
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Okay, so you've raised a couple of things. One is um, that it's just fact, after fact, after fact, okay- which is different than physics for you because physics is applying itself to real life for you. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, it is. 

00:28:15
MICHELE TISSIERE Because you're using memorization in physics. You have to memorize in history, too? 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:28:20
MICHELE TISSIERE Yeah? But it's not as relevant to you because it's just a fact? 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:25
MICHELE TISSIERE Uh-huh. And it sounds like attendance has been an issue. So let's split those two pieces apart for a second. 

00:28:30
One-to-One Conferencing 

00:28:30
Step 4: Plan of Action 

00:28:30
JOSEPH KANKE Like, kids are coming up with the answers. I'm not giving them to them. So I have to be making sure that I'm asking questions that are leading, that aren't yes or no; and I'm not handing them the answer. 

00:28:45
MICHELE TISSIERE The reality is you're going to have to memorize some of your history? 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yeah no matter what. 

00:28:45
Michele Tissiere , ESR Facilitator Step 4: Plan of Action 

00:28:45
MICHELE TISSIERE so I'm wondering- let's think about what you do in physics that might help you in AP history with memorization. What's a strategy you might use in AP history for memorization for all those facts? 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Well, for AP history, like, I can just relate it to how that certain event in history has gotten us at where we are now. 

00:29:10
MICHELE TISSIERE Ah, that's a great idea, okay. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) How I can relate it to the present. 

00:29:10
MICHELE TISSIERE Right? So you're going to take a historical moment and try to see how it's had, it has had implications for today? 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:29:20
MICHELE TISSIERE Okay, that's a great idea. Give me an another strategy you might use. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Well, for physics, since I'm really strong in it, instead of taking like 10-15 minutes, I should spend more time, like, like twice as much. 

00:29:35
MICHELE TISSIERE Twice as much time on the U.S. History piece? 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:29:35
MICHELE TISSIERE What would that look like? 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN Well, it'll be- well for U.S. History I won't just read it, I'll actually have to like take notes and just write myself like, notes on the side of the paper or underline them, really like this thing- the most important. 

00:29:55
MICHELE TISSIERE (crosstalk) Okay; the most important- so it sounds like if you get into the-- so are you using a textbook or are you using Xerox copies of things? 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Um, a textbook. 

00:30:05
MICHELE TISSIERE A textbook? 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:05
MICHELE TISSIERE So you're idea is I'm going to read through a paragraph. I'm going to underline key events and I might write a little note to the side? 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Yes, ma'am. 

00:30:10
MICHELE TISSIERE And then I might look at how it applies to today? 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:30:15
MICHELE TISSIERE The implications for today, okay; that's one goal. All right? That's a great goal for you. 

00:30:20
Brenda Porta, Lanier HS, Austin Step 4: Plan of Action 

00:30:20
BRENDA PORTA Let's talk about time first. What do you think we can do to maybe find time or schedule? 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN Uh, just scheduling. 

00:30:30
BRENDA PORTA Scheduling? 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN Just like, put a list and okay, I'm gonna just do the work on it with an hour this day and then if I have left over, just do it tomorrow. You know? Just like be more prepared and organized about my time and my day. 

00:30:45
BRENDA PORTA I like the list idea, too. Because that way you can see it written down and it will be helpful for you to then- 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, and just put the most important things like first, cuz sometimes I put the most fun things first. Like I'm going to have time-I have the weekend or I have this time and it's just like lay back and then it's like the next day and I have to turn it in- I'm like oh, God I forgot. 

00:31:15
BRENDA PORTA So about your list and your schedule; when do you think you'll start this? 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Um, hopefully today. 

00:31:20
BRENDA PORTA Okay, today 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Because I really do need it. 

00:31:20
BRENDA PORTA Okay, and where would you keep it so that you can go back to it? 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN Um, my mirror. 

00:31:30
BRENDA PORTA In your mirror? 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Cuz I am constantly looking at it and I want to keep it somewhere I am going to look at. I'm not gonna put in like in my drawer because I'm not gonna look at it. 

00:31:35
One-to-One Conferencing 

00:31:35
Step 5: Power of Praise 

00:31:40
JOSEPH KANKE All right, so it sounds like you have a good plan and I'm confident that you're going to stick to this plan of getting to class on time and we'll just check it and make sure that that's what, what needed to fixed, right? 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:31:50
Joseph Kanke Step 5: Power of Praise 

00:31:50
JOSEPH KANKE And if your grades are still not exactly where you hoped them to be in a week, we can maybe look at the data a little closer and see if there's something else going on there. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:32:00
Michele Tissiere, ESR Facilitator Step 5: Power of Praise 

00:32:00
MICHELE TISSIERE It sounds like you're uh, self-reliant and you take good care of yourself, yeah. Okay. So you've got a couple goals for U.S. History. You'll take notes, you're gonna underline the information and you're going to apply the historical event to today. I'm gonna check in on you next week and see how this goal is going, all right? Thank you. 

00:32:20
Joseph Kanke , Lanier HS, Austin Step 5: Power of Praise 

00:32:25
JOSEPH KANKE It sounds like you're really recognizing that it's a clear correlation between graduating and high grades is going to class and I think that's so important. I'm glad you've made that realization and I think that you'll see in your grades, especially as we wind up the year, that that's going to show a huge improvement. The next time that you're tempted to skip because I know that the weather is supposed to be nice this week, I'm hoping you can think back on temptations you had about skipping and think how you overcame them. What things went on-- what process went on in your head? How did you stop yourself from doing it? And then maybe when we meet up, we can talk about that? 

00:33:00
Charlie Smith Social Studies Teacher, Manual HS, Denver 

00:33:00
CHARLIE SMITH Advisory kind of gives them that space to develop that; just really taking ownership of their work and they do that by putting their grades into a tracker and reflecting on those grades and just really understanding why they got those grades; so just the skill of reflection. When you do something well, you should reflect on it. When you have a bad day, you should reflect on it, in the- with the understanding that, you know, it's a way to grow and it's a way to move forward. 

00:33:25
Joseph Kanke English Teacher, Lanier HS, Austin 

00:33:25
JOSEPH KANKE During one-to-one conferencing, I think the biggest thing I've seen is watching kids actually grow into adults. And in the one-on-one conferencing, I really just have that chance to watch them go from not knowing to why they're failing a class to having a stepped out plan so that they can be successful. 

00:33:40
Dominique 

00:33:40
DOMINIQUE You have to think and like he really cares, and so it makes you be like- man, you know you just want to see him happy and stuff and then you have to think about yourself because why would you want to seem like you're not smart when you really are.
