SHANNON DERMER Welcome. My name is Dr. Shannon Dermer, and I am the Division Chair of Psychology and Counseling at Governors State University. I am here with Dr. Byron Waller today, and we are going to be discussing career counseling and specifically a narrative approach. Dr. Waller, why dong you tell us a little bit about yourself. 

00:00:40
Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:00:40
Associate Professor, Governors State University 

00:00:40
Division of Psychology and Counseling 

00:00:40
BYRON WALLER I am an Associate Professor at Governors State University. I've been involved in career counseling and career development for many years, about 15 years. In fact, I am involved with the NCDA/ACES Commission on career development. So I've been… this is definitely a passionate area for me. 

00:00:55
SHANNON DERMER So, you've made your career on career counseling. 

00:00:55
BYRON WALLER Yes, I have. 

00:00:55
SHANNON DERMER And how did you get interested in career counseling? 

00:01:00
BYRON WALLER Well, in my education, in my doctor degree, I worked with one professor who focused on career development, and once I started, I continued on. As a matter of fact, I worked in the career area, even after my bachelor's work. So career has always been a focus of mine. 

00:01:20
SHANNON DERMER And it's actually a focus of CACREP standards also. 

00:01:20
BYRON WALLER Oh, yes. 

00:01:20
SHANNON DERMER And why do you think that is such a big focus. I mean, there is a whole section on just career counseling. Why is that such an important part of accreditation standards for counselors? 

00:01:30
CACREP and Career Counseling 

00:01:30
● 2.4a - Theories and models of career development, counseling, and decision making; 

00:01:30
● 2.4d - Approaches for assessing the conditions of the work environment on clients' life experiences; 

00:01:30
● 5.B.1b - Emergent theories of career development and counseling; 

00:01:30
● 5.B.3b - Strategies to help clients develop skills needed to make life-work role transitions. 

00:01:30
BYRON WALLER Well, I would say for two really clear reasons. First of all, counseling started through career counseling. I mean we look back at the early development of what counseling looks like and we talk about individuals who are involved in career, and as it developed over time, career continued to be an important part of what… what made counseling the profession that it is today. So, that's one reason. A second reason I would say that career is really important for… as a CACREP standard is, because the one thing that we are going to more than anything in our lives is work. And really… and as a counselor to help people make decisions that they are going to do more than anything in their lives is really important. So for counselors to know what theories and how to help people in that area is really vital. So I see that's why it's important as far as a CACREP standard. 

00:02:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh good. You know, I… my master's degree was in psychology and then I went on for a doctorate in marriage and family therapy, and we weren't required to do stuff in career, but then I became… you know, I went to the counseling program, this marriage and family… marital couple and family and counseling, and I had to see what they had to do in career, and then first I was like, why is there such an emphasis on career. But then like you said, we spend a huge portion of our life at work or in our career, and it affects us but it also affects our families and it affects a lot of things. And I don't think I ever had an appreciation for that until I… I did become more a part of the counseling field. 

00:03:05
BYRON WALLER Well, I think even more what we begin to see especially in today's world, how important career is. It… it creates opportunity for us to have flexibility and mobility in our lives, and to see how it impacts our families and even our own self-esteem and our self concepts. So it really shows how important career is especially as a counselor. 

00:03:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. For a lot of us, it's a big part of our identity. 

00:03:30
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:03:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:03:30
BYRON WALLER Yeah. 

00:03:30
SHANNON DERMER And so… but we are not just going to talk about career counseling, we are going to talk about a specific model that I think a lot of counselors can embrace, and that is narrative. What… what makes this type of style narrative career counseling? 

00:03:50
BYRON WALLER You know, that's a really important question for us as we talk about CACREP and narrative counseling. CACREP talks about emergent theories and narrative is an emergent theory. You know, for a long time, we used to look at career and career development by using a more positive… positivistic perspective. You know, we can measure things, you know, like we measure what's going in an environment, what's going on in a person, and that's really how career development started. However, the environment is very different now. Now, we have a change in technology, change in careers. In fact, most of the career…… the… the jobs that are in the… half of the jobs in the top 10 are careers that had just been invented over the last 10 years. So, it's a lot of change. And with that change have come new ways in which we want to understand careers. Part of that paradigm shift had been the inclusion of a constructivist idea, the idea that we are constructing our reality, constructing our careers over time. 

00:04:55
Constructivism and Career Counseling 

00:04:55
● Constructivism holds that each individual can create their own truth and reality. 

00:04:55
● Constructivism in Career counseling helps the individuals to construct their career path that is based on their personal meaning and patterns in the individuals stories. 

00:04:55
BYRON WALLER Rather than having to measure it in the environment, we are now constructing as we move along. So narrative therapy allows for us to begin and understand how do we create and construct those careers. 

00:05:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay, good. So, career counseling isn't just like, I think how some people think of it. It is where you do this inventory, and you check off what you like and what you dislike, and what you are good at and what you are not good at, and then it tells your best jobs and career. What you're talking about is really the story, the narrative about how we choose our jobs and then when… when we do choose our jobs or our careers, as I should say, then how our careers influence our lives and vice versa and how our life influences our careers, but then also how society and change also influences our careers and how we put ourself in that environment. So it's a narrative… 

00:05:50
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:05:50
SHANNON DERMER and not just a checklist. 

00:05:50
BYRON WALLER Yes. In fact, we will continue… we continue to use those checklists, because they have… they have value. It allows us to see some things that we normally would not see. So they have value. However, with the new environment that we are in, many individuals are looking for a meaning and purpose. 

00:06:10
Narrative Career Counseling 

00:06:10
● Larry Cochran 

00:06:10
●The first person to apply narrative theory to career counseling 

00:06:10
●He proposed career counseling that emphasized meaning and meaning making. 

00:06:10
●Listen for the beginning, middle and end of the story. 

00:06:10
●Identify meaning and patterns in stories. 

00:06:10
BYRON WALLER They are looking for more than just a salary. They are looking for ways that they can express themselves in the world, and they can have satisfaction. And as a result, we are looking for theories that we can express very differently. And narrative therapy allows for us to do that. In fact, the first person who began to integrate this information into career counseling was Cochran. Cochran came along and began to talk about how career counseling is really more about meaning and meaning making rather than just a job that we need to do. He began to talk about how in our narrative or in our story, there is a beginning, there is a middle, and there is an end. Usually, the beginning is one where the person is talking about a difficulty they may have. The middle is when the person is beginning to look at not only the problem or not only the difficulty, but strategies that they can do in order to resolve the problem. And then at the end is where the counselor really begins to become involved so that the person can begin to construct their reality or construct their career based upon what they've said from the beginning and from the middle, and the counselor helps them to move forward from there. And so, the counselor can begin to look at the patterns that come up in the stories, in the meaning that the individual might give to those particular stories. 

00:07:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, it really is about meaning. 

00:07:35
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:07:35
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:07:35
BYRON WALLER Meaning making, because we tend to talk about stories that are most important to us. And Cochran was first to begin to integrate that into this career counseling area. So it was the first start at integrating it. 

00:07:50
SHANNON DERMER Well, great. What else… what else do we need to know about narrative career counseling? 

00:07:55
BYRON WALLER Well, there are a couple other people who have continued to develop and grow in this narrative approach. 

00:08:05
Centerpoint Model 

00:08:05
● Carol Vecchio 

00:08:05
● Helps clients to tell their stories through the metaphor of seasons (Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer). 

00:08:05
● Counselor uses intuitive skills to find their vision and use their energy to follow their life path. 

00:08:05
BYRON WALLER And there is another approach called the centerpoint model by Carol Vecchio where she began to talk about the stories that people use and that they have this meaning and to help the individual to begin to listen to themselves, you know, pay attention to their intuition, pay attention to those patterns that they may have had over time. She uses seasons as a… as a metaphor and so to help them to move forward and using their tuition to create those stories. So Carol Vecchio was one who continued to use that narrative approach. And then we have another person who… who is really now one of the leaders in this narrative approach. His name is Mark Savickas. 

00:08:50
Career Construction Career 

00:08:50
● Savickas 

00:08:50
● Emphasizes interpretative and interpersonal processes that gives meaning and direction to career behaviors by putting meaning on memories, experiences and patterns. 

00:08:50
BYRON WALLER And Mark Savickas has really taken this narrative approach and provided structure to it where we can help people in a clear way, but also allows for us to use our own understanding of what's going on with the client. So, it's been really, really effective. And a career construction theory is one of the most researched theory right now. 

00:09:10
SHANNON DERMER Oh, really? 

00:09:10
BYRON WALLER yes. 

00:09:10
SHANNON DERMER Well, that's good, I mean especially with the emphasis for CACREP and… and all the mental health fields in… in general, evidence based, you know. So, it's good that you say, you know, it's really being looked at through research. 

00:09:25
BYRON WALLER Yes, and not only here in United States. The… the impressive part about the career construction theory, it is an international theory. 

00:09:30
SHANNON DERMER Well, that's nice too. 

00:09:30
BYRON WALLER Yes. And we are… we have… as a matter of fact, I had an opportunity to go over to Europe last year, and having a conference in Italy to talk about career construction and how… in France and in England and in South Africa. They are beginning… people are looking for ways to have meaning in their lives and not just a job. 

00:09:50
SHANNON DERMER And again, that's just nice, because counseling in general is looking to go… to… to really go to global theories, things that can be applied internationally. So, you're saying this can and has been already applied in international settings. 

00:10:05
BYRON WALLER It… it has and continue to grow, because of really some of the structure that Mark Savickas have begun to provide, you know, because his… his concepts are very clear and when you being to understand the concept applied, it becomes easier. 

00:10:25
Career Construction Career 

00:10:25
● Concepts: 

00:10:25
● Vocational Personality - what people prefer to do. 

00:10:25
● Career Adaptability - how people cope with career challenges and transitions. 

00:10:25
● Life Themes - memories, experiences and themes impose meaning on vocational behavior. 

00:10:25
BYRON WALLER Some of the concepts, for example, talking about vocational personality, which really is what people prefer to do, their vocational behavior. And second concept, the career adaptability, how do people cope with challenges, their developmental process, and over as they begin to look at the career development. The interesting part about career adaptability, it was taken from Donald Super theory, which is the first one who began to look at career across the lifespan. So, he didn't completely abandon what has been done before, but really integrated into the theory. The third… 

00:11:00
SHANNON DERMER So, it's… it's a green theory they recycled. Sorry, just kidding, you know. Sorry, you had… 

00:11:05
BYRON WALLER No that fits right in. And the third concept he talks about, which really is a major, major piece of the theory is the life themes, where people begin to look at their memories, their experiences and how they impose meaning onto those memories and onto those vocational behaviors. So, it's like… the career adaptability looks at how the process occurs, vocational personality talks about what the career process is, and the life theme asks the question why, why is this meaningful for this particular person. And it… it allows to help the person move forward in constructing their careers. 

00:11:45
SHANNON DERMER And I bet a lot of your supervises really like this… because it's a little bit closer to regular counseling where it's not just very specific, although it is career counseling their lives and integrating the knowledge about their lives into the career counseling. 

00:12:00
BYRON WALLER Yes, it is, and it's counseling. You know, it's important that we tell our students counseling, it's counseling. And what we can do though, we provide a frame for it, and this narrative approach provides that frame that we can use in order to help people make decisions regarding their careers. 

00:12:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:12:20
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:12:20
SHANNON DERMER What else… what else do we need to know about narrative counseling for a… for a career approach? 

00:12:25
BYRON WALLER Mark Savickas continues to develop that structure for us. In fact, what he has done, he has crated what he calls the career style interview questions. As a matter of fact, he had seven of them. The first one is just to… to create a frame for the person to know what you're trying to do in that particular section, time with the person. 

00:12:50
Career Style Interview Questions 

00:12:50
● How can I be useful to you in constructing your career? 

00:12:50
● Ask questions about life, role-models likes and dislikes. 

00:12:50
BYRON WALLER And then six other questions that he might ask. Again, they're semi structured, and then you ask the questions but you have freedom in order to clarify and explore the process with the… the client. 

00:13:00
SHANNON DERMER So they're kind of some basic questions, but they are just a jumping off point for you to explore more depending on how they answer it. 

00:13:05
BYRON WALLER In fact, yes, that's… that's true. As a matter of fact, they… they call it more stimuli to a list of certain responses from the… the person, because they will then put meaning to the questions, and that is really important part in the career construction theory. 

00:13:20
SHANNON DERMER Good, okay. And what has been your favorite part about getting involved with this theory? 

00:13:30
BYRON WALLER Well, it's active and it's also one, which allows for interpersonal process, and even the… the interpretation of information that the person may again talk about. The interesting part about it, it's not all me as the counselor to interpret all of the information. Many times the… the client themselves are interpreting information as they talk about it. So, it makes it where it's an interpersonal process and not just the counselor, you know, the expert, but more saying, no we are involved in this process. 

00:14:00
SHANNON DERMER Collaborate. 

00:14:05
BYRON WALLER Yes. And you're talking about it and I am allowing you… asking you questions so you can better understand the answers that you're providing. 

00:14:10
SHANNON DERMER Great. So, once you give them these prompts, and you say, there's basically seven questions to… you said it very academically or something about stimulating their thought process. It was very well said. But once you give them those prompts or those stimuli, then what do you do with the information that they give you. 

00:14:30
BYRON WALLER Well, in fact, after we receive the information, then there is a process, again a structure, in which Mark Savickas have provided in order to interpret the information. We might begin by asking the person a story where we want to review what they've talked about. 

00:14:50
Interpreting the results 

00:14:50
● Begin to make sense of the client's stories by reviewing what they want from counseling. 

00:14:50
● Look for verbs in their early recollections. 

00:14:50
● Look at headlines written for early recollections. 

00:14:50
● Try to understand how the client is attempting to solve the problem in constructing their career. 

00:14:50
BYRON WALLER They provide early recollections in which we ask them for three, and they provide a headline for those early recollections. Or we might ask them to… to talk about some challenge or struggle they may have had, and to allow them to see what the solution to that particular problem is. 

00:15:05
SHANNON DERMER How does that relate to career then? If you're asking about an early recollection, something that they overcame, then how do you then connect that back to career? 

00:15:15
BYRON WALLER See, the interesting part about this is it how people impose meaning onto the questions. So, there is no particular answer, but it's the… it's the… the client imposing the meaning to the answer and how that answer becomes significant for them. 

00:15:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, what if… okay. I am going to give you quickie. 

00:15:35
BYRON WALLER Oaky. 

00:15:35
SHANNON DERMER I was really into like animals, I loved animals when I was a kid, and one day a Greenpeace sent like this, postcard of this little baby seal who had been clubbed for its fur, and there was… there was… it's sad, but the mother seal was like laying on top of it to try and keep it warm, but it was, you know, deceased. And so, I cried for about two days after seeing that, and then I became a vegetarian at age seven, and I'd been a vegetarian ever since and we won't say how long that is, but it's been a long time. And so, like, I think, you know, sometimes people that as like I was stubborn, but I saw that as like once I set my mind to something, I did it. So then how would you relate a recollection and the meaning I attach to that back to meaning for my career? 

00:16:30
BYRON WALLER Okay. Well, two things I will probably ask. First, I will probably ask you to come up with a headline, an active headline for that. Again, soliciting something more from you, how you are going to impose meaning to that story, and it's not me imposing meaning, it's you. And then you will tell me what the headline is all about. So that's that first thing I will probably ask you. The second thing is pretty clear. You're… you're talking about constant… consistent themes in your story like the caring parts, the mother and the seal… the mother seal and the child seal, and the compassion that what showed, and how, for you, you had to make a decision based upon that. and you decided not to eat animals. 

00:17:15
SHANNON DERMER Little baby animals. 

00:17:15
BYRON WALLER Yes. And so, you can see how that connected to you, but I was saying, it goes further when you begin to think about what you do know. Now, you teach other people about caring and concern for others. 

00:17:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh, you're good. 

00:17:25
BYRON WALLER Well… 

00:17:30
SHANNON DERMER Because that was just a little example, but yeah I can see where you're going with that, because I was thinking… you said, what would be the headline, I mean, maybe it was like activism or advocacy or something, because I decided like other people don't have to do that, but I made a choice for myself or what I wanted to do. And then, yeah I was thinking, you know, that fits with kind of my career, you know, you added on that piece of the… the caring that I teach other people that to… you know, how to care in a professional way for other people. And so, yeah I can see where that would be… especially if you had several stories and several headlines, how you could help someone to read those together to create a meaning that could also help them choose a career path. 

00:18:05
BYRON WALLER That makes it so important in today's world, because now people want to have meaning in their lives. And salary is important, but so is meaning, mobility, flexibility, satisfaction, those issues are becoming as important as salary. So, it allows for people to make choices in their lives, especially in an environment that is not be as clearly defined. So if you refocus on those things, people can make those decisions as far as their vocational behavior and vocational choices. 

00:18:40
SHANNON DERMER Now… and I definitely can see where the narrative approach helps you to… to find the meaning, and we only have a little bit of time left, but I am wondering, do you think that people want more meaning from their career than they used to. 

00:18:55
BYRON WALLER I would say yes, and… and my answer would be based upon the changes again that are happening. Their used to be a social contract that we had, in which the companies will take care of individuals who work for them, and usually you work for that company for 25, 30 years. You retire, they pay you a retirement and you go on. However, that social contract has been, you know, terminated. Now, no longer can individuals depend on a company to take care of them. Now, it's up to each individual to make those decisions. And if an individual had to make those decisions, it is based to base it on their meaning, their purposes, their values. So, when they begin to work and make decisions about what their life might look like, they can do that. In fact, we know that before the age of 38, each individual will change jobs at least 10 times. So… and if they are going to change it 10 times, then we need to make sure that people are making those decisions based upon their values and not on result of a test. 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER That makes sense. Thank you, thank you for sharing that, and I am looking forward to see you in your demonstrations. 

00:20:10
BYRON WALLER Fantastic. 

00:20:10
SHANNON DERMER Thank you.

00:20:15
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:20:20
BYRON WALLER Okay Jahaan, you… you know about career construction theory, we are looking at how you look for meaning and what you do. So, I have some questions I would like to ask you if it's okay with you. 

00:20:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Sure. 

00:20:30
BYRON WALLER Okay. The first question I would like to ask you is how can I be helpful to you as you construct your… your career. 

00:20:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Well, I am looking to develop a career in the counseling field, and I would like to… for you to help me best navigate that path. 

00:20:55
BYRON WALLER Okay. Okay, so in our short time that we have today, what… how would you like us to use this time to help you in the counseling field? 

00:21:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Maybe if you could share with me what I could do… what I could begin to do to move in that direction and how I can best be successful in that… on that path. 

00:21:15
BYRON WALLER Okay, okay. Okay, and I think we maybe able to do that, especially as you just try to come up with some things that can help you to make the next step for you… 

00:21:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:21:25
BYRON WALLER … and getting into the career counseling field. So, the first question I would like to ask you is could you talk a little bit about your earliest recollections? Can you talk about something that may have happened when you were between the ages of three and six years old? 

00:21:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH So many great memories with my mom. My mother was in the service, so I am a military baby. I won't claim brat. And my mother joined the service after we were born. So, I remember my mother going away to basic training. And one of my earliest fondest memories of that time period is when my mother came back from basic training. I was about six or seven years old, and we used to… there… there was a grocery store chain that is no longer here in Chicago that was here at that time. So I was with my grandmother and apparently my grandparents knew my mother was coming home after being away for quite a long time, and I didn't know that she was coming home. So, it was my grandmother and me and my sister, one of my sisters in the grocery store, and my mother walked in, and I remember running down the isle and just jumping on her like I missed her so much. She looked different to me, she had lost weight. Well, it's just natural when you go at a basic training, but that was one of my best, earliest memories. 

00:23:20
BYRON WALLER What happened after that? I mean you… now you jump into her arms, you ran down the isle, you jumped into her arms, and then what? 

00:23:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH My mother was a very loving mother. So, she gave me lots of hugs, lots of kisses. I come from a very affectionate family and I remember going to the grocery store, seeing my mother and then we left with my mom. The grocery store was like maybe three blocks from our house. So, we… we drove home and she had what I thought at that time was her suitcases and stuff in the back. Well, when we got to the front of the house, she said, I have a surprise for you, and it was covered up. I wasn't really paying attention to that, because I was just so ecstatic that my mother was home. We got out of the car, and before we went into the house, she said, I have a surprise for you. And she opened up the trunk and she moved the blanket and she took a 10 Speed bike, a blue 10 Speed bike for me, and I was so happy. The bike was too big for me, but I was so happy, I was so… I didn't know whether to be happy about the bike or be happy about my mother being home. But yeah… 

00:24:50
BYRON WALLER Oh that sounds like a really exciting memory for you. Could you come up with another one? 

00:25:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Sure. A lot of them… a lot of my early recollections surround my mother and our family, because my mother was a very hands-on mom. So, I remember when my mother was called… this is an early recollection. Would you like it from that same time period? 

00:25:20
BYRON WALLER Yes, between ages of three and six years old. 

00:25:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. That's a little bit later. I remember my mother playing games with us. I remember… I was born and raised more slim. So another memory that sticks out of my mind is Ramadan one year. It is a practice in Ramadan that you get gifts often throughout the month of Ramadan and my mother gave us a gift every day during the month of Ramadan, and I found where she was hiding the gifts. She was hiding the gifts in the closet. And I am short person but I found a way to get up there in the closet. It was up on the shelf, and it was a game. And she is kind of lightweight, we are kind of lightweight to get in trouble. You are being nosey, you shouldn't be in here, blah, blah, blah. But when I found it, she let me have it, and I remember sitting in the living room playing the game and my mother said, okay, since you found it, we'll play… we'll play with the game. So, I grew up going camping. My mother put up the tent in the living room. And tents have openings, she turn the opening towards the TV. So, the TV would be like our movie screen and we sat inside of the tent and play the game, me, my mom and my sister. And then we slept in there like we re camping. 

00:27:05
BYRON WALLER What was special about that for you in that memory, I mean, for you? I can… I can hear it had effect on your entire family, but the thing about it for you. 

00:27:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH The most recent memory I told you about or the first one. 

00:27:20
BYRON WALLER Yes, this one here related to the camp and the game. 

00:27:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH What was most special to me about it? 

00:27:30
BYRON WALLER Yes, for you, yes. 

00:27:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Umm… If I can be honest, I don't know that I can answer that question without answering it from my current time period. 

00:27:35
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:27:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Umm… It has grown special to me, because I saw… I see now just how hands-on my mother was, and in studying love and languages, my mother's love language was a very hands-on love language. And I… I trusted my mother and I knew that my mother loved me. I could feel the love and I could always feel the love, even in that time period, I could feel like why she could have swatting mean, and you're getting nothing out, because you shouldn't have been here. She took that opportunity to be even more hands-on and even more loving, and that often sticks out to me in my adulthood. 

00:28:35
BYRON WALLER I can see how they can be really special even now as you look back at it, but even in that moment of having your mom embrace you and… and to allow you to even play with her that sounds really, really special. 

00:28:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. 

00:28:50
BYRON WALLER I am going to ask you for one more, just one more recollection. 

00:28:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:28:55
BYRON WALLER Between ages of three and six years old. 

00:29:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Well, I went to kindergarten at a place called Chicago Child Care Society. It's a, what I now see, was a… was a more hands-on institution. We learned differently. And my mother knew that early on. I… my sister and myself, what I learned later, are individuals with differences, and that's not something that I often talk about. 

00:29:40
BYRON WALLER Sure. 

00:29:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH But it's the truth. Umm… This school was a school that catered to not just children with difference, but to diverse populations as well. So, I remember playing, I remember going on the jungle jam, I remember taking trips, I remember… 

00:30:05
BYRON WALLER Was that… what that one event that happened while you were at this Chicago Care facility? Was something specific that you remember? 

00:30:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH If I had to say one thing that sticks out to me is that I am… I am short now, but in kindergarten I was always the tallest and biggest kid, and I always thought I was going to be the tallest and the biggest kid. 

00:30:30
BYRON WALLER Does something happen as a result of that? 

00:30:35
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH No. 

00:30:35
BYRON WALLER I mean did you have an experience with any of the kids or the… or the teacher? 

00:30:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I got kicked once in the stomach by a boy named Daniel. 

00:30:40
BYRON WALLER Okay. So you remember that. 

00:30:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Um-hmm. 

00:30:45
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:30:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I do. 

00:30:45
BYRON WALLER Okay. So you did really good job in… in identifying three early recollections. Now, what I would like to do with those early recollections is to come up with a headline. 

00:30:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:30:55
BYRON WALLER A headline for each of them, okay. I'd like for you to come up with that headline, and I would like for you to be able to come up with one that is active, that has an active verb in it, okay. 

00:31:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:31:10
BYRON WALLER Okay. Let's go back to the first recollection that you had. 

00:31:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:31:20
BYRON WALLER Okay. And you talked about your mom coming home and being in the store… 

00:31:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:31:25
BYRON WALLER … and running after her, and… and going home and having that… that bike for you. Could you come up with a headline that will really speak to that recollection that you had? 

00:31:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Maybe a sprint to love. 

00:31:45
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:31:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Because I remember running super, super fast to my mom. 

00:31:55
BYRON WALLER Okay, okay, a spring to love. 

00:31:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:32:00
BYRON WALLER Okay, that's good. How about the second one, the second recollection that you had? Do you recall the… do you recall the recollection? 

00:32:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I do. 

00:32:10
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:32:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I don't know, because you said you want… want to have an action verb in it. 

00:32:25
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:32:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH So… 

00:32:30
BYRON WALLER You know… 

00:32:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH playing with… playing with family. 

00:32:35
BYRON WALLER Okay, okay. Yeah, because I was thinking at the first part when you… when you found the game. 

00:32:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Oh, okay. 

00:32:40
BYRON WALLER When you found it, and then as it developed, you know, the… the whole experience itself. 

00:32:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Climbing to… 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Climbing to camp. 

00:33:10
BYRON WALLER Okay, climbing to camp, okay. 

00:33:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:33:10
BYRON WALLER That's… that's good. Now, how about the third one? The third when… when you talked about being at Chicago Care and being tall and bigger than everyone else. Can you come up with a headline that might… 

00:33:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH But you want it to be action, so… 

00:33:30
BYRON WALLER An active verb. 

00:33:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I remember being bigger, being taller. I don't know if I have an action verb for that one. 

00:33:40
BYRON WALLER Okay, okay. Well, what we will do then, we will keep those in mind and maybe a headline may come a little later. 

00:33:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:33:50
BYRON WALLER Okay. But we… we want to move forward. I have another question to as you. 

00:33:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:33:55
BYRON WALLER Could you come up with a… a saying or a motto that is important to you? 

00:34:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH One that I've learned. 

00:34:05
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:34:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Oh, that's easy. One of my favorite saying is by Maya Angelou and it says, "When you learn, teach." 

00:34:20
BYRON WALLER What makes that important to you? 

00:34:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Because my mother always taught me to give back. She said that, that is… and I… I am not choosing my words carefully. She just said it so many different ways, but the premise of what she was trying to say is that, that is where happiness in life comes from when you help others, when you love on others, when you give to others. There… what do you really know if you learn all this information and you don't give it to somebody else. It's just information at that point. 

00:35:05
BYRON WALLER So that's what made it important from you mom's perspective as you… I am wondering now specifically for you what make it really more significant for you. 

00:35:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH The motto? 

00:35:20
BYRON WALLER yes. 

00:35:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I love to learn 

00:35:20
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:35:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH So, anybody who is willing to teach me, anybody who is willing to give back to me, I view that as… I don't know, a symbol of… when people give me their time, and a lot of time comes through teaching, I look highly on that and I've learned that about myself in the last few years. When people do for me when they don't have to, and a lot of times that comes through teaching, that says a lot to me. So I know it to be important and, and I want to be important to someone else in that way. Give whatever it is that I know, so that they can be independent, so that they can live full and thriving lives. 

00:36:15
BYRON WALLER So you… even in listening to you right here, the importance of learning and of giving and causing change… 

00:36:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yes. 

00:36:25
BYRON WALLER … with the people that you're involved in, and that's what… 

00:36:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Creating positive change, yeah. 

00:36:30
BYRON WALLER That's important for you. 

00:36:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It is. 

00:36:35
BYRON WALLER I am wondering though, who was a role model for you as you were growing up. 

00:36:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH The first person that comes to mind is my mother. 

00:36:40
BYRON WALLER My mother, okay. How about other than your family? 

00:36:45
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:36:50
BYRON WALLER Who would you consider a role model? 

00:36:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I almost look to people who give back, and I find myself drawn to people who teach. I find myself drawn to people who are free givers of whatever it is that their craft is. So, people who are knowledgeable, I am drawn people who are smart and who are willing to share that… that information. So, if I have to say one person… 

00:37:30
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:37:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH That was an indirect role model, because they weren't necessarily in my life. 

00:37:35
BYRON WALLER You could come up with a direct one, you know, because many time, you know, in school, whether it's in elementary school or high school, you know, there was a teacher or another organization that you were involved in, that person stuck out for you, because they engaged you and modeled for what you… where you wanted to go. 

00:38:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Umm… Early on, I had a teacher named Ms. Salahuddin. 

00:38:05
BYRON WALLER Okay. 

00:38:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH And she was very… I don't come form a loud family, but I… for whatever reason I remember her when she spoke, she always spoke very low and also always spoke with a very caring tone, and I remember feeling like… I like shoes and I like clothing and I like makeup, and… I am that… I am that "girly" girl, and she was that person that I always looked at and said, wow, if I could just be like that, if I could wear my shoes that way, if I could wear my hair that way. Even though she wore hijab, you would see her sometimes without it. My mother allowed me to go to her house and play with her children, because they were around the same age as myself. And she was just a very nice person. I never felt different around her, I always felt special. I always saw her in a way that made me feel good. And she always told me that I was beautiful, that I was pretty, that my smile was amazing, that… and I always wanted to be like that, and give back to others in that way. 

00:39:35
BYRON WALLER It was really interesting, you say that those things really attracted you was how she spoke, how she presented herself, and that was attracted to… attractive to you. Well, it's really interesting even as we are talking and how you're presenting, very similar way would she present it. 

00:39:55
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH And that's interesting, because I have been told that before. I… I actually… I don't know that I want to call it struggle, but for lack of a better term at this time, I'll say, I have struggled with how it is that other people view me and how it is that I view myself. Like I don't… I don't… I don't suffer low self-esteem, but I don't see people. People have always told me that I have monotone, that I am people pleaser, that I am always willing to help, and I never feel like I do enough. I always feel like I am talking too loud. I always feel like I am not… most of the times when people say things, I feel like it is the opposite of what it is, I feel the opposite of what it is that they are saying, really. 

00:40:50
BYRON WALLER Well, in… in our interactions, you definitely have… have shown that. And what we are going to do, we are going to talk a little bit more and just put this together, and we will talk even more how this could be helpful for you to guide in your career. 

00:41:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:41:00
BYRON WALLER So, thank you. 

00:41:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Thank you. 

00:41:05
CAREER DEVELOPMENT: 

00:41:05
USING A NARRATIVE APPROACH 

00:41:05
WRAP-UP 

00:41:05
with Byron Waller, Ph.D. 

00:41:05
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:41:10
SHANNON DERMER So Dr. Waller, I have to say… you know, I watched your demonstration with Jahaan. It was a mock session. And I have to say, I didn't expect career counseling to be so touching. It was… it was sweet hearing her stories about her mom and her meaning and the stories that she picked. So talk a little bit about how you're processing that form the narrative career, you know, model, as you were listening to her. 

00:41:40
BYRON WALLER You know, as you saw, many of those questions, they were pretty structured. They were particular questions that I had to ask. 

00:41:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:41:45
BYRON WALLER However, along those other questions, I was… I was able to explore with her and get some clarity on those. You know, the great part about this career construction theory, the primary issue is the relationship. And for me, it was very clear as far as the relationship between she and I was really as quickly established. 

00:42:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:42:10
BYRON WALLER And so she was willing to share more information when that relationship was very clear. And even though, we… the questions were structure again, they meant something different for her. Again, the questions elicited a certain type of response, which… which… and that… and that response was the meaning that she imposed on… on them. So yeah, they were touching, but… but some clear patterns and ideas came from what she shared. 

00:42:40
SHANNON DERMER Oh, absolutely. So, if this was a real career counseling session, what are some of the hypotheses you would start making about how… what kind of meaning she wants from her life and then how that would relate to career choices? 

00:42:55
BYRON WALLER We will probably do a couple of things first. One thing I will probably be… what I would do first is first I would try to see the connections between the recollections, because there were some things that she talked about in all of the recollections, for example, her mom was discussed throughout all the recollections, and the important that she has for her. Secondly, she talked about learning, you know, in each of those recollections, whether the challenge of them or desire to help people learn or desire for her to learn, that was very, very clear. The… the idea of family for her and being involved in interpersonal relationships were… were important for her. So those types of themes were really, really clear for her. A second thing that was really… that I would do with her is to talk to her about these patterns that I noticed and to talk about specifically with her what do… what do they mean to her. And… and since we had that relationship, I… I think that would go in a particular direction where we will talk about what it means for her to have a family who are inactive… active with her or what does education mean to her, what does it mean for her to interact with people and how she desires to continue to contribute to the lives of other people. Those were probably some thing that we talk about. A third thing that I will do, I will look at the… the verbs that she talked about. And although we ask about active verbs, a lot of her active verbs were like running, you know, playing, they were very involved with other people. And so, you can see her desire to be involved with people as a counselor. You can see some of these themes sort of jump out as we begin to talk about, and so I will do that first before looking at what's the next step for her. 

00:44:55
SHANNON DERMER And why verbs? Why that… like I get why they are asking like tell me a story and then the headline, because that kind of boils down the meaning for them, why verbs, why action? 

00:45:00
BYRON WALLER Because there is movement, it's showing the movement as you talk about career construction, you talk about constructive ideas, we are looking at movement and growth and development. And so, when it's active, you can see that in a person's story. It also gives an opportunity for them to begin to say, okay, so what's next. This is what I have been doing, now what's next for me to make these ideas I have more of a future desire for myself or future reality for myself? 

00:45:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, it's a little bit of content and then it might give you more about meaning depending on what verb they choose, but it's also about process, this idea of moving forward of development of action. 

00:45:45
BYRON WALLER Yes, yes. In fact, and also looking at why. So, we are able to look at what the content looks like, the how, the process, and the why part, why is this really important for her, and that's where the meaning comes out and which allows us to move to next step in creating a… a choice that she wants to make in the path that she might… might want to take as a career. 

00:46:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So tell me a little bit more, because, you know, that was obviously a very short demonstration, around 20 minutes or so, but if this were a real client, what were your next few steps be in session with her? 

00:46:20
BYRON WALLER In fact, there… there are seven steps to take in… in working with a client at this… this point. Sure, we would have taken those three steps that I have mentioned before, but even after we've done that, I would have taken all of the information and I would have developed what Mark Savickas calls a life portrait. 

00:46:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:46:45
BYRON WALLER A life portrait is you take the information and you begin to identify the themes and you write a portrait, a short one-page story based upon what they've told you, and that's what… 

00:46:55
SHANNON DERMER You, as a counselor. 

00:46:55
BYRON WALLER Yes. 

00:46:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:47:00
BYRON WALLER I will do it, but it's not mine, so I will write it and give it to the… the other person, and the other person takes it and they review it, and they review it and they move… they put information in that you may have missed or they take away information from them. So, it's like creating for them a map for themselves to make… to make the next step. 

00:47:20
SHANNON DERMER And again, it's a collaborative process, and that they get to review it, give it back. 

00:47:25
BYRON WALLER Yes. And then we discuss it, because that helps us… it will help the individual to make a choice, a decision regarding what's next for them. A second thing we will do is again using past career development theories. We will look at the RAISEC model, the one by John Holland, and we will identify a type that best identifies this person as they move forward, very much like the vocational personality that Savickas talks about, so that the person can develop what Savickas called a success formula. This is the formula that the person has established that they can follow to continue to reach many of those areas that they really want to move into regarding their careers. 

00:48:05
SHANNON DERMER Great. So, it's not this like static thing, and we are almost out of time, but it's not this static where it's like, oh here, now you decide on a, you know, career. This, as you said, like, you know, this formula for success that they can use, and that they… that they can think into their future, and as they are considering, because you said what, like you're going to have 10 different jobs or careers before you're, you know, 40, 38, something like that. That's… this process is something they can use in considering their development across time, even when they're not… no longer in your counseling room. 

00:48:40
BYRON WALLER Yes, and that's what makes it so important is, this is a dynamic theory, it's not static in which, as the person continues to develop their career process, you know, they can continue to look back at that success formula, look back at the life portrait and continue to make career decisions for themselves. 

00:48:55
SHANNON DERMER That's great. Well, thank you so much. I know you could probably tell us a lot more about this, that we've simplified for the time's sake, but I really feel like I got, like a glimpse into narrative career counseling. So, I appreciate it. And I want to thank all of you for joining us for CACREP, the essential skills for counseling practice. I hope that you've got the passion for career counseling, especially the narrative approach like our esteemed guest like Dr. Waller. Thank you.
