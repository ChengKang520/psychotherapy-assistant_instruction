UNKNOWN Thank you. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, please find you seats. Welcome back to Saturday morning for all of us who are now awake. Uhm, this is the, ah, the panel, ah, on abuse in families. We stellar panel this morning, ah, we have Cloudia Black, Julie Gottman and Cloe Madanes each of which could spend their day doing a workshop for each of us, for all of us, so we're really lucky to have them here together. Uhm, so without further ado we'll begin with Claudia Black. 

00:00:45
CLAUDIA BLACK There is my ma-- there we go. Hello, everybody, good morning in the Saturday morning. By the way I don't drink coffee but I do drink diet coke to get me going at eight o'clock into Saturday morning and as I came down the elevator I had a great little meeting with some other women and we all decided that we should be Skyping this into your hotel room so you can stay in your pajama. So just put that down in your evaluations next time for 8 a.m. on Saturday into the hotel rooms. But, ah,-- and Julie just gave me a little pep talk that I get to lead the way with all this energy and still there. So, let me begin by saying this, it's truly an honor to be here, ah, at the table with vote Cloe Madanes and Julie Gottman, ah, very much. So, I've had the opportunity to work with Cloe several years ago here at the Evolution but not Julie. And, ah,-- so I'm gonna talk about, ah, ad-- abuse and the context of the family and as-- I think most of you know my work is predominantly be in the in the addiction's field. And the reality is you cannot work with people who experience through on addictions and work with families impacted by addiction without addressing the phenomena of abuse. And I think that it was one of the other presenters that said to me last night, "I'm in abuse. What is abuse mean?" And so, for me I just really needed to think about what I really wanted to say in the context of the word abuse because abuse can be very, very broad and I'm talking about trauma later in the day and I talk about a little bit yesterday with Daniel Amen. So, when I'm talking about abuse today I'm really talking about the fact that in addictive family systems you are much more likely to see very blatant physical abuse. We know that physical abuse is much more ra-- is more-- three times more act to occur in an addictive family system. We know that sexual abuse is much more act to occurred frequently call existing not necessarily a cause and effect to relationship. Dau-- daughters and substance abuse in homes and the researchers predominantly with substance abuse and with comes to addiction today we also certainly address behavioral addictions. But if there's any statistics I give you really the research is all about substance abuse that daughters in substance abuse in homes are two times more likely to have been sexually abuse not necessarily by somebody within that family system often that is true but it maybe by somebody within the extended family or outside of that family system. Sons are four times more likely to be sexually abuse to males in an addictive home. And again, not necessarily by somebody within the family could be by somebody outside. Now I don't mean to employ that males are more have to sexually abuse than females. Males are more have to be sexually abuse in comparison to other males not in substance abuse in homes. But in my work-- and I'm actually gonna make my comments really in reference at two kids. Kids speak the truth in many way so much more readily than adults whelm. There is-- so I'm gonna actually show you some work that children who shared with me children who've experience abuse that very early on in my work and I did lots of group work with very young children. I had a group of children that everyone of them had experience violence in the context of their family. And in my naivety I went into group and fairly quickly after on-- in the group process ask how many of them had have violence in the home. And everyone these children, and they were seven kids in the group, everyone-- and I'm talking about children between the ages of seven and 11. Everyone of these children looked at me and simply didn't responds or slightly shake their head as if they were saying, "No". And for a moment-- because I was working in a hospital setting I thought maybe I've got into the wrong group. And that it maybe this was a group for children who's parents, you know, were sick, uhm, with another kind of illness, a primary healthcare illness otherwise other than addiction. And then I pause and I said, "Well, do you ever get hit in your family?" And everyone of those kids quickly began to nod their head, "Yes". So, one of the things that I find in working with kids is, you know, we need to be very specific and I actually do this with adults as well. We need to ask about the pushing, the shoving, the kicking, the pinching, the slumming somebody up against the wall until their teeth rattled. The terrorizing car rides. Certainly the ultimate act of abuse is when somebody is killed and I certainly see that working in addictive families but that much more prevalent is the more chronic abuse as I have just describe for you. SO, let me show-- we're gonna turn the power points on that's my note to Travis, my little cutie Travis. 

00:05:25
Abuse is Addicted Families Claudia Black Ph.D. Senior Fellow Addiction & Trauma Program Specialist The Meadows 2013 ANAMEIM Getting blamed for something I did not do. You Dummy ouch This happens in everybody's home at times but happens more often in an addictive time. 

00:05:25
CLAUDIA BLACK And I'm gonna share with you some work that just a few pieces here of children again prior to the ages of 11 years, "Getting blame for something I didn't do." And again, remember that I work in addiction so not only as he be in hit on the back of the head but is being hit on the back of the head with the can of beer as well. And the comment is this happens in everybody's homes at times which I don't think it does necessarily happen in everybody's home at times. But happens more often in an addictive home. 

00:05:55
Were not eat as well as we want to. Were All Feeling Down Can't Pay Bills THROwing away our money! Booze Dad other Buns Chris D'Alena Age 

00:06:00
CLAUDIA BLACK This actually portraits the neglect and I just thought it was a profound picture I wanted you to see it. This is a boy who says, "We're not eating as well as we want to. We're all feeling very down." Now I want you to picture this is the graphic bar seat. This is a child that on the board you're gonna see a lot of empty beer cans that's what the whole of pieces are. You're gonna see a full beer can and then you see money next to it, there is dad and he's sitting with all those other buns. There's booze behind the bar and, "we can't pay our bills". And one of the things that, that picture says to me as well knowing who this child is and knowing the community that I'm working is this child is not probably not work in home. The bars and not close to where he lives so he most likely is going home with a parent who's impaired. Which is abusive. 

00:06:55
Violence come's with the Alcohol. I'll smack you any time I want I'm scared oh know you won't. 

00:06:55
CLAUDIA BLACK And again, violence comes with the alcohol. "I'm gonna smack any time I want." And the wife has pull a knife and say, "No. Know you won't." And we have a little boy in-between who's scared. And which-- we're also seeing here is there so much of the abuse that accurse in the context of the family is the witness scene of abuse. And what we do know today in terms of long term trauma reactions is that the witnessing of abuse can be as traumatic if not in fact more traumatic. We know that with the Vietnam veterans that with equivalent combat exposure those who actually were physically injured were less up to experience PTSD than those who were the witness of. So we have to take very seriously the fact that we have such great numbers of kids for witnessing violence not necessarily the direct recipient of that violence. 

00:07:45
Were hiding when they fight 

00:07:45
CLAUDIA BLACK "And we're hiding when they fight." Now, I actually had another picture when I confined to someone who describe it for you and that is, it was very similar and the parents were fighting and this little girl had drawn her parents with their hair standing on end, their eyes bogeyed and their mouths very wide open and in cartoon fashion they were swear worst screaming at each other. And then she had drawn two sets of footprints that run into the bedroom. And then in the bedroom you saw at two little girls hiding behind the bed as I believe is reflected in this picture as well. And these two little girls, as children do that a lot like their parents she had drawn them with their hair standing on end but in this case their mouths were closed, they were shut. And there was also I think equally profound was that she had drawn there but opposite ends of two different beds across the room from each other at a time of tare. At a time of great fear they did not have the ability to bond, connect or to be of support to each other. 

00:08:50
Love is caring enough to Help But Sometimes it runs out. Love no more left! 

00:08:55
CLAUDIA BLACK And this is sometimes just simply as certainly think it tells us about attachment. "Love is caring enough to help but sometimes it simply runs out." There's no more love left in this bottle of love. 

00:09:10
Children of addiction are 2 to 4 times more likely to be sexually abused. They are prime for victimization as they... 1. Are often starving for attention 2. Are less apt to speak up because of fear of not being believed. 3. Give others the benefit of the doubt. 4. Don't trust their own perceptions. 5. Don't know what they feel and can't use feelings and cues as signals. 6. Are confused about appropriate boundaries. 7. Experience shame upon shame which fuels powerlessness. 

00:09:10
CLAUDIA BLACK Again, a few minutes ago, I said some things-- and it's hard for me to keep turning my back, so I wanna see if I can actually just get this right out. A few minutes ago, I said some things about sexual abuse and I just wanna to give you sort of my sense of why I believe children in addictive homes are more likely to be prime for victimization of sexual perpetrators either within the family system or outside at the family system. First of all, these are children who are typically not getting the consistent attention that in-- the appropriate attention that in fact that they need. And one of the things that we know is that perpetrators often will groom their victims prior to the molestation and they know how to pick children who are in need of so called, "friendly attention" and that's how the grooming begins often into the guys of friendship. These are children who are less up to speak up for the fear of not being believed they were already in a family system where the truth is not supported. So should they not feel safe, should something have began to happen in terms of inappropriate touch, they are less apt to let somebody know and is more apt to continue. They were already learning how to give other people the benefit of the doubt meaning they're learning how not to trust their own got and their own perceptions which will keep them in a victim role. They-- I mentioned yesterday, I believe you may not have been there that by the time in my work-- by the time I see these children in the nine years of age if they been chronically in an addictive home they already know how to deny and the language I think of when I think of children to nine is they already know how to minimize discount, rationalize. And as a little girl said to me pretending are different and how they really are. In the part of what they're pretending and it's different on how they really are is they're minimizing their fears, their humiliations, their angers, their sadnesses and feelings are cues and signals that can help indicate what it is that we need to be able to do. And if I can't use my feelings affectively as a cue and as a signal one more time this gonna set up for victimization. These are children that already confuse about what constitutes appropriate boundaries and these are children that are already internalizing shame base beliefs about themselves. The belief that who they are is not a value that they are less than, that they are not good enough. That happens when you're on a chronically addictive family system and then should I be sexually abuse. In essence we have shame put upon already existing shame and that's gonna feel in action, in mobilization more have to be a freeze responds which helps to perpetuate the victimization to continue. 

00:11:50
In the United States these children • Are at higher risk for placement outside of the home. • Are more likely to enter foster care and remain there longer than do other children. • Exhibit signs of depression and anxiety more than do other children. • The rate of total health care costs for children of alcoholics is 32% greater than for children of non-alcoholics. • Admission rates to hospitals are 24% greater and hospital stays are on average 20% longer. • In general, children of alcoholic families do less well on academic measures. • They have a higher rate of school absenteeism and are more likely to leave school. 

00:11:55
CLAUDIA BLACK And I just have a couple of more pieces and I'll turn it over to my co-presenters here. Here are some, ah, facts again that, ah, you can get the sources for this with the National Association for Children of alcoholics and if you want to know what those sources are I would go to their website it's called NACOA, N-A-C-O-A.org, NACOA. And what they are saying about children from both substance abuse in homes and some cases again the research is very specific to alcohol. They're at higher risk for placement outside of the home. They are more likely to enter foster care but I think just as important they're more likely to remain in foster care for longer periods of time. They exhibit science of depression and anxiety more so than others. The rate of total healthcare cause and that's primary healthcare as well as psychiatric healthcare is 32% greater admission rights to hospitals are 24% greater and on an average there stays are 20% longer. In general they do less well in academic measure and they are more apt to leave school prematurely and I'm gonna suggest to you I think this has a lot to do with the fact that they are experiencing abuse in the context of their family systems.

00:13:05
CLAUDIA BLACK And then, I thing that I'll just conclude more remarks and I can save more later if we have various questions to respond to. That in working with kids and they working with adults with this trauma, you know, I really advocate what they referred to as a t op down bottoms of prospective and that is that you do, do cognitive behavioral work with his kids. I do a lot of problem solving with his kids, uhm, a problem solving in a vacuum you do a lot how to take care yourself in the phase of great adversity and challenges in the context of the family but we also need to teach themselves soothing kinds of techniques to help lessen all that reactivity in that limbic system and that this regulated brain stem as well. And that's where we can bring in the expressive arts, that's where, ah, we can-- I've-- one of the things that I've done in the last couple years since I have given a lot of time, ah, to organization, uhm,-- a foundation and it's called the Moyer Foundation and for those of you from Seattle is Jamie Moyer the very famous baseball player so Julie knows who that is. And they have a foundation that really responds to children in distress and it do a lot of bereavement camps all across the country. And they came to me a handful a years ago and now they're beginning to do camps for children from addictive families at no cost. And we are predominantly reaching out to kids whose parents are involved in drug course or kids who are involve in foster care. So these kids do not have recovering families and wish to go back into and you see a lot of, ah, dysregulation in the behavior of these kids and one the things that is so touching and I just love it when I go to camp is the self soothing work that they do with these kids. They do a lot of problem solving with the kids. They do a lot of play work with the kids but they have the kids doing needle work. They have the kids doing, ah, trauma informed yoga, street yoga and they quickly go-- you can't even give these kids a good camp experience if we can help calm down as I said all of that reactivity. So those are just some of my task I have for today and I've said a lot so let me turn this over to, ah, Julie Gottman. 

00:15:10
JULIE GOTTMAN It's okay. I have mine. Was that wonderful? Claudia is so knowledgeable. I feel very, very honored to be after you, it's great. So, here is what I would like to talk about today, uhm, ah, I started, ah, with treating incest and rape, ah, along with heroin addiction in the Boston Combat Zone, ah, which was one of the poorest ghetto areas in the city. And it looked to me like domestic violence was almost always involved, ah, in the families who are suffering from poverty. So I work with individuals for probably, uhm, 15 years or so until, ah, John persuaded me that it was really okay to merge our brains which is what I did. Uhm, and so John is really my cerebral cortex and I'm the amygdala. So I'll be speaking to you as the amygdala this morning. Uhm, so, uhm, first of all, ah, and his colleague Neil Jacobson did a nine-year long study of domestic violent couples. They brought couples into a lab, they did see them physically hit each other but they did video tape at their conflict discussions. They gave them questioners. They did follow up of these couples. And the results of those studies were very significant what we found is that characterological domestic violence was very different than situational domestic violence. Now what we believe is that characterological domestic violence where there is a clear victim, a clear perpetrator, nothing the victim can do can change the violence at all represents the people that we're seeing in our shelters. However, somewhere between 60 and 80% of couples with domestic violence are what we call situational domestic violence. Situational domestic violence looks very different, first of all its symmetrical meaning both people are violent. Secondly, Donald Dutton found this in 1995 and I was horrified to learn this as a feminist from way back very old feminist. Seventy-one percent of the first blows in situational domestic violence are thrown by the woman. Now of course what this means is not women are equally violent to men, that's not what it means and we know that men who hit can cause much more harm usually than women. In this situational domestically violent couples, uhm, there was minor violence meaning there was no significant injury, there were no hospitalizations, there were no lacerations, there were no broken bones, no weapons use that we saw in the characterological domestic violence. And tomorrow when John and I give our longer talk on domestic violence in a treatment program for it. You'll be seeing films actually of these couples straight out of the lab. However, what we also saw is that these couples really took responsibility for the violence they had consents they wanted to change they were desperate to change. So, let's back up a little bit, uhm, in about 2005 John and I were invited by the administration of children and families to create a program for couples in poverty that six out seven states engage in the study chose to use ours-- our curriculum. So, uhm, these were couples mostly from the deep south or from the Baltimore ghetto. And we created a very different program for these couples than the usual kind of middle class lecture and then go do a few exercises and this program became the basis for a couples program that we developed to help couples deal with situational domestic violence and that's what I wanna tell you about because it worked which was astounding to us. So we did a study where we screened out characterological domestic violence very carefully. And here was the program it was composed of two-hour meetings of small groups of couples five or six couples with two facilitators. In these small groups they would meet once a week and they met for about 20 weeks or so, so it's about four months long. These couples, uhm, would first watch a videotape of me with three couples that we filmed in a TV studio where the couples that I interviewed in each of these tapes were couples in profound poverty, couples who have had terrible violence, couples who had been in prison, couples who had addiction, couples who had infidelity these couples were the wisest to people, the wisest once. They talk about how they would reach their boiling point and then how they would calm themselves down. They would talk about how to recover from infidelity. They talked about how to have intimacy after having a baby. How to talk about conflict without exploding. How to recover from domestic violent episodes. Each one of these tapes each one was an hour long and I actually taped 42 of them we added it down to 10 minutes the, the primary pieces and this wasn't like opera where, you know, she was really the center of attention. I wanted these couples to be the center of attention many more effort in American, people of color. So, in this small groups of our program which we called the couples together against violence. The couples together would watch a 10-minute video about a particular topic, they would then discuss it amongst themselves and the facilitators are trained to facilitate the conversation not to jump in as the experts as the gurus, as the teachers. But instead to praise these couples for being transparent to draw themes out amongst the couples for how they overlapped and had similarities. And we also knew that couples with drop out of the program if they look like school because many of these couples that had terrible experiences in school. So we wanted them to feel respected. We wanted their voice as to be heard with one another. So, in our study these couples would talk to each other about this particular topic of that week, then the two facilitators would give them a small little teaching just a little one maybe 10 minutes long and then give them an exercise to do. That exercise would come from the methods that John and I have developed over the last 20 years that would teach them things like how to express their needs. How to turn towards one another. How to recognize when somebody was making a bit for connection. How to self sooth when they were escalating in a quarrel. How to take breaks. We had them also talk about their own wounds, their own childhood pain with one another and they heard stories from their partners that they'd never ever known before that help them to understand why their partners would get triggered, why their partners were so vulnerable. We had modules in which couples talked about wanting to be the family protector not the family destroyer. We talked about how to prevent infidelity and recovery from infidelity that it all ready happened about how to manage their anger. About when they were hitting up how to calm down. About how to talk about stresses outside the relationship in a way that didn't shut down their partner but rather opened up their partner to be more vulnerable, to be more intimate with them. What we found is that compared to a control group these couples with domestic violence who stayed with their groups eliminated domestic violence and we did follow up at six months, 12 months,18 months and 24 months. They had eliminated domestic violence. They reduced their hostility. They reported higher, much higher relationship satisfaction. We also filmed them having a conflict conversation because, you know, self report data is very bias specially if this, if this subjects really like the people who are giving them the questioners. They'll wanna please that interviewer so we wanted to see how do they really deal with conflict. We found that management skills improve enormously. Another thing that we included in our program which was very important is a little bio-feedback device. Before they did their exercise during the modules we use a little bio-feedback device called an emWave. EmWave is made by HeartMath. I see Claudia nodding her head she knows of that one. They would clip it on their ear and you look like a little cell phone for five minutes they would watch little lights. Do you remember those mood rings that would change color? Well, the emWave has a little light on it that also changes color from red to blue to green and their goal is to keep in the green zone so they would work on that for five minutes before their did their exercise and guess what that was teaching them. This is 5-minute a week, all right? It thought them physiological self soothing they learn how to drop their heart rate. They learned how to create greater heart rate synchronicity. So along with learning the skills that we were teaching them about conflict management they were also literally going inside their body to calm their bodies physiology. So the results were, uhm, very, very exciting we were very happy about these results. Uhm, and we are now, ah, recreating the study in Oregon with court referred domestic violent couples where again we're screening out for characterological violence treating only situational domestic violence. And this is being supported by the department of corrections by judicial system as well and by the police. They are referring as couples for this treatment program. So we won't be publishing until we've got a second study with good reliable results but it looks very promising and the last thing that I wanna note is that in 31 states the laws of the state do not allow couple therapy for any domestic violence. Interesting isn't it? So that really need to changes. Also what we know clinically is that probably 60% of the couples that you are seeing have had a domestic violent episode. So, do you ask about it? You must. And then, think about how you can help your couples and I'm very grateful to all of you for being here because what you are wanting to do is to enhance your knowledge so that you can deepen the love of the couples in front of you even those who are hurting one another. So, who those to you, you are doing great work to create a little more loving the world. Thank you.

CLOE MADANES All right. And, and has been fascinating and the three of us have different subjects, it's so interesting. I'm going to talk with you-- ah, to you about, uhm, the results of, uhm, study on, ah, treatment of juvenile sex offenders. Uhm, this was, uhm, when I had my family therapy institute in Maryland this was finance by the Department of Juvenile Justice in the state of Maryland and supported by the department of social services in count-- county. And we followed 72 cases they were all boys the crimes range from, uhm, mild to extremely horrible, extremely violent, ah, to the point that it's difficult to understand how a teenager can hurt a little child in, in that way. There's subject of nightmares. And, uhm, so I am not gone with really-- this is I have to give you this in very broad strokes. Uhm, 33% of the victims were blood related children either younger children in the same family, uhm, or, ah, cousins, ah, relatives in some way. The important thing here is that we had 96% success in the sense of no repeat offense. And also because this is family therapy in the cases where the victim was in the same family the victim participated in the therapy and none of the victims were victimized again or beca-- became victimizers. And this was followed not only by us but by the department of Juvenile Justice because the records for children and teenagers are consider children are secret. So we had to send independent investigators to find-- to do the follow ups that were at least two-year follow ups. The three cases that we counted as repeat offence out of the 72 were really not a violent offenses and could hardly be considered offenses at all. One boy was arrested for exposing himself in the street but to any particular person. Ah, so we couldn't figure out whether he was going to the bathroom or what he was doing. Another boy, uhm, had try to break in to the house a little girl but it turned out he just wanted to give her a letter of apology. And another one touched another boy inappropriately in school. Uhm, a little more than 30% of the victims were males, so many of the victims were male. So for this project I developed a method of 15 steps and I'm going to give you the method in very broad strokes. Def-- the, uhm, the report on the results of this study are in my book The Violence of Men and I've lecture overtime, uhm, about this 15 steps and interestingly enough that were picked up by very few people and very few organizations. I had a wonder surprise here at this conference on the day that I gave my 3-hour workshop. There's a lady and her name is Jane(ph) and I have to blank for her last name she's from Wisconsin. They brought me to Wis-- Wisconsin to teach this and then they work with 1 65 juvenile sex offenders and they had only two repeat offenses following exactly the same steps. Thank you. Thank you. And my student are now calling George Stone in Alaska has been using these steps within indigenous people in Alaska expanding the steps to work not just with the family but with the whole tribe, the whole community and also has the same extraordinary results. So, let me give you the steps and a hope that some of you will pick up and them and use them. All right. So, the first step is that you bring the whole family together to discuss the abuse that is you go around the circle and you'll ask each person when they know about what the offender did to the victim. The language has to be like that, you don't say, "What happened?" You'll say, "What did the offender do to the victim? What did the older brother do to his little sister?" It has to be specific. You include of course grandparents, uncles whoever is in the extended family that you can include. This step is very important because incest is possible because it secret. Actually all violence is possible because it secret otherwise society medially intervene to stop it. So, it's very important to reveal the secret and most of these families they never talk together about the appeals. So, step number two, is that you'll ask the offender why what he did was wrong. Why was it wrong? And the offender has trouble explaining typically he was say it against the law, it's against religion, "I took advantage of her." Things like that. So that you will ask as part of this step you'll ask the adults in the room to help him so the adults may say now the child has nightmares, has night terrors, doesn't trust anyone, it interfered with their sexual development. And you say that, "Oh, this is true", you agree. And then, step number three, is that you say, "This is particularly wrong." Because it cause spiritual pain in the victim. Then it's not just physical pain. It's not just emotional pain. It's a pain in the spirit, in the soul of the person." Ah, if you have trouble talking about the spiritual or the soul you can say a pain in the heart of the victim because in our culture the heart is the center of spirituality so people know immediately what you're talking about. So this is the crucial important to address, because once you talk about the spiritual pain their family knows that you understand them and they are much more likely to follow your, your directives. So, at this moment after you pointed out this spiritual pain the next step step four, typically happens spontaneously because they feel understood, they tell you that there were other victims an victimizers in the family. So, the mother might say, "I know exactly what you're talking about because I was molested by my father, my uncle or whatever. And so, I know what that spiritual pain is." They might tell you that the offender himself was se-- sexually abuse. And it's important not to let them use this as an excuse. So what you say is hold them more reason if he suffered the spiritual pain himself not to inflicted on another child so you don't let anybody get away with the idea that they're doing this because they were talk themselves. So the, ah, step number five, is that you'll say that what the offender did cause the spiritual pain in the offender himself because it is so terrible to do something like this to another human being. So you show empathy and compassion for the pain of the offender. And believe me all my therapist say that the pain of the offender is worse than the pain of the victim. These boys hate themselves. Now, in, into studying Wisconsin with, ah, 165 offenders some of the were girls. So I think that they were also female offenders but it's just recently that it's come to the attention or that people have acknowledge that it exist, it was a totally taboo subject the idea that a woman could be a sex offender. So step number six, is that you say that what the offender did also cause the spiritual pain in the mother of the family because is it so terrible to have her child suffer like this, and in the father and in every family member. I say the mother first because usually the one that is most hurt is the mother. But in some cases it's the father or grandparent. And then step number seven, and I try to get to step number seven in one session but my many of my therapist need more time and it works anyway so it doesn't matter. So, in step number seven I ask the offender to get on the floor on his knees in front of the victim and express sorrow and repentance for what he did. You can put words in his mouth. You can say, "I want you to say how sorry you are for what you did to her that you wish you hadn't done it. That you wish you could make it up to her." Whatever words come to you expressing your sorrow and how resentful you are. It's very important not to let the offender say, "Forgive me", because forgive me is a request and at this point he's in no position to make a request. In our language we often use indistinctly, "I'm sorry and forgive me", and they're two very different things in some other language was like French it's almost impossible to distinguish between the two and it's a very important distinction to make. Now, when the offender gets on his knees and apologizes everybody in the room has to decide whether he's sincere or hypocritical. If anyone in the room thinks that he is hypocritical, he has to do it over and over, and over again until every agrees that he's sincere. Ah, in step number eight, you'll ask the parents and the adults in the family, grandparents if they are there to get on the floor under knees in front of the victim and express the sorrow and repentance for not having protected her from the offender. This is very important because typically the victim comes to therapy confused with a sense of shame and guilt because the offenders typically specially in ongoing incest use like a hypnotic procedure to convince the victim that she wanted it, that she initiated it. So it's very important for the adults in the room to convey to the victim that they should have protected her, that she's not responsible for any of this. Now, in the middle of all this if the victim wants to say, "I forgive you." I always allow it of course but I will never ask her to forgive because I think that forgiveness should not be trivialized and I believe this certain things cannot be forgiven and should not be forgiven. So, if she says, "I forgive you", I would say, "I admire you for that. That's wonderful but I would never request it." Uhm, so then the step number nine, is you discuss what the adults in the room what the co-- future consequences would be if the offender should do anything like this again. And you help them to settle for the harshest consequences. He will not be able to live with her family anymore. He'll have to be in an institution in foster care and so on. Uhm, step number 10, is that you'll need to find a protector for the victim so usually we look for somebody in the extended family that is strong, and a good communicator and a respectable person. Ah, a good uncle could be a protector of the victim. It has to be somebody that can be a little scary. So for example a grandmother could be scary, two grandmothers together could be very scary. Somebody that will address the offender on her regular basis and say, "You better behave or you're going to have to deal with me." All right. Step number 11, is reparation. The adults and the family agree on when onset reparation the offender well do towards the victim and I preferred the reparation to be towards the victim. For example he'll get a job as soon as he can and will deposit in the bank certain amount of money in the name of the victim for her education in the future. But we've also use symbolic reparation like donations to children hospital, ah, of, of person of accessions of the offender that he truly values or service in the community and someone but reparation is very important. And our-- my therapist had been very creative in finding important ways that juveniles can do reparation because it's that easy in our culture. All right. Uhm, step number 12, is that you have to have a discussion on sexually both the offender and with the victim. And with the offender we like to have a session just with father and son with the father explaining male sexuality to the son. And why do we instruct the father to explain is that men who have not committed in sexual crime can have many different kinds of sexual fantasies, but once a boy has cross that line and committed a crime he cannot even allow himself to fantasy at all. And anything related to children is the wrong fantasy so you have to plan if the fantasy comes, if this side comes, what is he going to do? He's going to get out of there, get out there running. He's going to run to church and pray or run to his grandmother's house and tell her. Or find a buddy go to McDonalds and two hamburgers something that is contradictory with engaging in a sexual behavior, very important to plan this. And, uhm, one of the problems what we've had with the families that we're very religious, a very Christian, ah, is that you cannot encourage masturbation for the boys so the boy has no sexual outlet. At the beginning I was so naive that I was bringing the elders of the church to give permission for masturbation. I succeeded with Catholics, the priest will come because for, for the protection of the child a priest will give permission for masturbation. And by the end of Protestant then in Judaism is really is not important so masturbation is not something that is immortal sin. But, ah, among Christians it is so we've had, we have just to hint and suggest that they offender when he's felling nervous take long showers. Ah, all right. So with the victim we like to emphasize that she's-- this was just a bad experience that is not going to taint her future. That it doesn't mean that she's a victim. That eventually she's going to fall in love and, and love a nice a boy and so on. So we do everything possible to normalized the le-- the victim. Ah, step number, ah,-- where am I? 

00:46:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Thirteen. 

00:46:35
CLOE MADANES Ah, 14 I think. I think. It's okay. Well, the next step. Ah, the next step is the restoration of love. You can not end, ah, these therapies without restoring the mother's love. And, uhm, I say the mother because it's usually the mother, uhm, there's two kinds of mothers that once that turns against their offender and cannot give their love and the more difficult moments for us to idea with either mother said turn against the victim. And that somehow stay with the thought that the victim somehow provoke this. So, we use a hypnotic procedure regressing the mother to when that child was a little baby and how much she love that baby and even back to the womb and back to the delivery and all that the mother suffered for that child through childhood illnesses and so on. Until we find that spark of love that we then cultivate. The, ah, the next step is restoring the offender's position the family. Because at somehow and these cases were all court order and the court was waiting for us to say the offender was typically in the detention center coming to the therapy and the court is waiting of us to say he can come home now. So usually by after step seven we let him come home but he's still is ostracized in the family so you have to restore some of his position as an older brother. So you ha-- we have him advising the younger children about how to tell good friends from bad friends, how not to use drugs. We put him in some adviser with capacity. And finally, the last step that I developed really a little bit later but it's very important is the forgiveness of self. Notice that this is a first time I use the word "forgiveness" but it's really important for the offender to be able to forgive himself because otherwise he will never come out to that spiritual pain, it can go on for years and years. So we help him understand that yes he did something very bad, yes he suffered terrible spiritual pain but people who have terrible spiritual pain I also hire spiritual beings so that means that during his life he will be able to help other people that have also suffered. So, these are the steps. I just want to say that, ah, one more minute that, ah, this of course can be plug we've use it also when the victim is outside the family. We've use it with adult offenders but I don't have a study on that it's just a clinical work and it's very effective with adult defenders. We've adapted the steps to martial violence also and it's very effective. Okay. Thank you. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN At this point of, ah, I know the, the, ah, panel would like to discuss with their peers have had to say? 

00:49:55
CLOE MADANES I want to say something Julie about, uhm, ah, the idea that, ah,-- I mean the facts, the statistics that you have that, ah, in many cases it's, ah, I don't remember exactly it was sadistic but it's a wife that begins the hitting. I was invited by the Queen Sofia Foundation in Spain, ah, to talk about violence and I presented all these. Ah, Queen Sofia is personally interested in the prevention of domestic violence - 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:50:25
CLOE MADANES And in Spain they had the whole idea that these women were all total victims that never said the wrong word and now they were angels. And so I presented the facts because it's not only your research, there's a lot of research now that chose that very often, uhm, I think actually most often is the wife that either gives a first punch or it's starts with the insults. And then when the man is trying to leave the house she will stand in front of the door so he can't leave and then he starts hitting that is typical, ah, the difference is that she ends up in the hospital and he ends up, ah, in jail that's, that's a different. Well, I provoke the scandal in Spain like you would not believe it they wanted to kill me. But then... 

00:51:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Oh, No. It's a-- that's violence. 

00:51:20
CLOE MADANES Oh, yes. 

00:51:25
JULIE GOTTMAN International violence. 

00:51:25
CLOE MADANES I, I had to send all the reference because I didn't have them on my dreams. The way - 

00:51:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Donald Dutton - 

00:51:30
CLOE MADANES - very interesting. 

00:51:30
JULIE GOTTMAN - 1995. 

00:51:30
CLOE MADANES Oh, yes. 

00:51:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. Yeah. You're absolutely right. As a matter of fact, uhm,-- and incidentally I love your work this is just magnificent. I wanna give another hand of - 

00:51:45
CLOE MADANES Thank you. 

00:51:45
JULIE GOTTMAN - applause to Cloe's work. 

00:51:45
CLOE MADANES Thank you. 

00:51:50
JULIE GOTTMAN It's a beautiful, beautiful work. Uhm, the thing I wanted to note is that , uhm, in the decade that followed the released of Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2, the percent of women who-- well, let's see, how should I say it? The percent of homicides committed by women doubled in 10 years. The percent of women possessing arms doubled in 10 years. So, you know, we have to look to our media and the alleged, geez, isn't this great revenge is wonderful, it's so sweet not when it's violent. Nobody deserves their life to end, right? 

00:52:40
CLOE MADANES Yeah. 

00:52:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. 

00:52:45
CLAUDIA BLACK And, and I just wanted to comment to, ah, Cloe, you very first question when you bring all of the family members together and ask, "What do you know?" When just how important it is to bring as many of those family members together as possible to break what in my early work I talk about in terms of breaking the don't talk rule. I mean this is that in of itself is so profound in terms of the possibility of truly changing this family secret because what we know is these secrets truly- 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:53:15
CLAUDIA BLACK - and they take a long time before they ultimately kill but they will kill and destroy on emotional physical psychological way. And these are people who, you know, have learned how not to talk because they think that nothing could be calm from talking that in fact if that is they talking some-- for period of time are gonna even get worst and sometimes in their experience priors the opportunity for therapy things did get worst in the beginning. In the long run we know things will get better, they have major issues around loyalty, uhm, often sort of false-- form of loyalty with major issues around loyalty whether not you're working with the 5-year-old in the family or a 55-year-old in the family or an 85-year-old people struggle think that they're betraying, ah, the, ah, this person that they actually love or care about. I often talk about with betrayal that you're not betraying the person that you care about you're betraying whatever the dysfunction is in the family, whatever the disorder is in the family. But the biggest reasons people are talking this nobody else is talking and just to have that model that ended up itself is a very profound intervention. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Great. Thank you. It looks like we'll have time for just a couple questions. Would you like to begin? 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN Oh, sometimes when we have families that are court order it's easier to get them in the room to even begin the process. Can any of you, uhm, speak to how we get extended family and even immediate family in the room when they're very resistant. I was actually interested in hearing maybe Ms. Madness, uhm, address that I wanted to ask yester but missed the opportunity. I worked with, ah, that young adult population of 17 to 25 and some of the parents like go of the parenting role and don't show up. 

00:55:00
CLOE MADANES Yes. First of all, let me say it's not Madness, it's Madanes. I have family in England that change their name to Meadows(ph) because they got tired of being called Madness. So, you, you know, we worked with judges, we work with the guard system very carefully. And a judge tell me, "You know, it's really not legal to mandate a family to therapy. We can mandate an individual but, uhm, not the family but the families don't know that." And so, we came to judges in Maryland mandating families to therapy. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:55:40
CLOE MADANES And that's how we did it. It's very important to have the support of the legal system. 

00:55:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. Can I also mention, ah, and answer to that question that specially when you're dealing with young offender family members are afraid to come into treatment because they are afraid they will be blamed, right? For not, ah, - 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:05
JULIE GOTTMAN - raising a healthier, uhm, more peaceful child. And what they need to really understand is that, uhm, they're not there to get kneeled, they're there to help in the healing process. And when, ah, a child or a young person in a family commits a criminal act, as Cloe was pointing out it, uhm,-- actually Claudia as well, it injures the entire family. They are all injured so they need to come together in order to heal each other. That's the purpose of bringing them in. 

00:56:45
CLOE MADANES Let me add one little thing there. What I often do is, uhm, identify the elders in the family and invite them in without the delinquent, without the offender just to talk for example to the older men in the family about how everybody wants the next generation to have a better life. And have this as an opportunity for them to contribute to a young person whose destroying his life. 

00:57:10
CLAUDIA BLACK Right. And I just wanna add-- again I think we appeal to what Julie were speaking about. We appeal to their fear, we appeal to what it is they're not able to, ah, speak. The-- they're not able to speak about their fear, they're not able to speak about their guilt, uhm, and that's predominantly they're feared of guilt is can keep them away. And also sound simplistic but you have an attitude of expectation, as what Cloe was saying, you know, the judge can't legally do it but they don't necessarily know it. But even it are not involve in the course system we expect family members to be involve versus invitation. So think in terms of expectation versus invitation. So how it is you ask them to come in if you take that attitude of, "We need you to be here", versus, "Do you think you can show up on Tuesday night?" 

00:57:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. Good. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, regrettably even at the eight o'clock hour time flies when we have some really stellar presenters. So please, ah, join me in thanking our panel. 

00:58:10
JULIE GOTTMAN It's okay. 

00:58:10
CLAUDIA BLACK Fabulous.
