SCOTT WALLS Okay, let's go ahead. We'll start. Thanks for being here. I'm Scott Walls. I'm your speaker today. We're talking about behavior skills, uh… behavior management skills for the classroom practical strategies for behavior and mental health concerns in school. This is a brand new seminar. I've been touring the country over the last almost four years doing oppositional defiant, disobedient, disruptive children and adolescences which is one of my specialty areas. And during that time of touring, I found that a lot of people that were coming to my seminar were educators and people working in schools and so I talked with PESI about developing a different seminar that, I think, will be helpful for people. I hope is helpful for people that are working in school settings or with kids obviously going to school because many behaviors that are taking place with kids or taking place in schools. And the average educator and administrator is not trained and what to do with kids with mental health concerns, and behavior. So I decided to do this seminar. And we debuted it uh… a little bit ago, and it went very well. And today, what I'm gonna do is give you that information. And my goal is to give you as much information and the time that I have today. So we'll be going to a 4 o'clock. And like, the coordinator said, "We'll take a little break around 10… 15 minute break or so and 11:50 to 1 is our lunch period. And then we'll do another break in the afternoon around 2:00, 2:00 or 2:15 depending on our… schedules kind of how I'm getting through the material. And then we'll end the day at 4:00 or so. A little bit about me which is summarized here, I'm a mental health therapist in private practice. I've been doing that since 98. My specialty is working with children, adolescents with behavior issues. I work for the public school system in Lincoln for about 15 years doing consultation and therapy with kids in special education programs. My partner and I handled between 150 to 200 cases a year related to special education so a pretty intense job. And during that time, I was in hundreds of classrooms and did thousands of hours of observation and consultation with staff regarding kids. I worked with refugees and immigrants that are survived torture and trauma. I have co-authored and authored some books on the subject. And probably the most fun part of my professional life, and they'll you hear me talk about today is that I work with kids in a martial arts school that I've started. And we've been running strong since 1998. My school uh… specializes in kids so we have little kids as young as four all the way up through kids in high school. And I think, we do a really good job in working with kids uh… with and without behavior issues. And so you'll hear me refer to that today because I practice what I preach in terms of behavior management principles and everything that I'm talking about today is stuff that I've done or will continue to do. And I try to make the seminar as practical as possible so I hope that's what you're looking for today, I receive an honorarium from PESI that's kind of the business part of this. I do not receive any funding from medical or pharmaceutical companies. In fact I'm… I'm quite glad of that. And I don't have to represent anybody's interests here today. So hopefully I am as free from commercial biases could possibly be. So my intent today is to give you as much information as I can in the time that I'm given. Umm… of course, you know, we… it's a… it's a nice group today. So I'm not worried about uh… conversations on the side and things like that. You know, sometimes I have to be a little bit more clear about that. But if you have a question, uh…feel free to ask it. If you do not want to ask it, bring it up to me write it down, and bring it up to me and I'll ask it for you. That is a something I would do for any of my students that I work with. Some people don't like to talk in front of the group and that's, and that's absolutely fine. This is a brief summary of the issues I wanna cover today to try to give you where we're gonna go today. I wanna talk about strategies for how to manage students with behavioral and mental health concerns. I wanna talk about things like, ODD, oppositional defiant disorder. I wanna talk about ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depressive conditions. Not so much in that diagnosing it and all that, but I want you to think about these disorders as I'm talking today because these are very common some of the most common ones out there. And once in a while you'll see kids that are indeed diagnosed with these and many undiagnosed. And so behavioral concerns along with the mental health concerns is what we're gonna be talking about today. We're gonna talk about special information regarding uh… children that have experienced trauma. That's very important to know something about as well as positive alternatives to helping students with the really challenging behaviors and how to increase the effectiveness or enhance your school-wide B behavior management systems. There's some things to think about as I was developing this course, I thought well, what typically comes up. And so these are things to just think about and maybe if you have something you want to throw out there in terms of what your concerns are. That would be fine, but think, what is the number-one concern about students that you have? Umm… what behaviors get in the way of academic excellence. Obviously schools are for academics. But we do so much more in schools. And behavior does get in the way of success. And so what are those behaviors that are getting in the way of success? What mental health concerns do you have in particular? I listed some general ones that are pretty common. But maybe you have specific ones and… and I… I tried to cover as many things as I can today. Regarding that what is the most effective thing that you've done? All right, and what are, what are the least effective things that you do? We all have hits and misses. You know, I do, and I know you do, things that work or your old tried-and-true interventions that you go to all the time because they work. And kids are successful when you do that. And then there's things that maybe come along that you try, and they're not always as effective as… as you want it to be. And I know, I get frustrated with that too. It's like darn it. You know, the book says this is supposed to do this. But yet in reality, it didn't work the way it said in the book. Or maybe a, a school is using a certain program. And a lot of programs that are out there, aren't they're not bad. It's just that they, they tend to work uh… pretty much the same way. And they seem to help most the kids that are fairly mild in their behavior. But if you're working with kids like I work with. And I love the kids I work with by the way. But my kids are on top of that pyramid. If I look at a behavioral pyramid, right, most of the kids are on the bottom of the pyramid because that's they're, they respond to pretty much everything that we do. They're generally pretty well behaved with an occasional blip here or there. And then there's kids on top of the pyramid that I work with that are oppositional defiant. And they need more specialized services and, and approaches because they don't respond that some of the school why'd things that sometimes we… we do, I think, it's important to be able to change things when we need to change them, and keep the things that are that are working. And so if you think about what changes do you need to make or should be made something to keep in mind to. The things I wanna talk about today student concerns and conditions. This is a more detailed list of where I'm headed today. So ODD, oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD, anxiety and depression, trauma, those are the big of the mental health pieces. And what we're talking about that kind of as a whole, and then I'll, I'll try to separate it out later on today's that have more specifics for each one. Self-harm and suicidal behavior, unfortunately suicide is a leading cause of death among young people. And depending on where you're at this is a second or third leading cause of death, so we need to know something about suicide in order to try to prevent that number from being so high. And also personally to deal with it when somebody is suicidal, it's very stressful. And it's stressful for schools. It's very traumatic. And if suicide is completed, of course, that is traumatic for everyone involved even for people that don't know the person that can be traumatic. So it's a big issue. Truancy is not necessarily a mental health issue but it is a uh… legal issue and a sort and of course, it's an educational issue. Kids that bully and, and bother are their kids, we'll be talking about that aggressive behavior probably for me that would be on the top of the list 'cause that's the most common complaint that I get about kids in a school systems being aggressive impulsive behavior, doing things without thinking and non-compliance just good old not following the rules. Uh…let me talk about ODD. My area of specialty, this is a very common disorder… about three to 16% of kids are diagnosed with ODD. And we have many more that have ODD that are not actually diagnosed with it. ODD exists with three clusters of symptoms angry irritable mood, argumentative, defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. And a child has to have four or more of these symptoms exhibited with another person that's not a sibling, all right, for a period of six months or longer. So it can't just be a sister arguing with a sister, it has to be beyond that. And it causes significant distress in that person's environment. So four or more of these symptoms, now think about it. These are all pretty negative things and that's what makes a person oppositional and defiant. Oppositional defiant behavior in school is often called other things, you know, severe emotional disturbance or behavior disorder. And of course, in schools, we don't diagnose. We verify with, with different labels. So you may or may not have somebody that's officially diagnosed with ODD, but they could still have those behaviors because to be diagnosed with it that means they have to go to some big qualified to do that. That's a clinician that has a license to diagnose. Uh… probably the uh… most frustrating thing about ODD is that we often miss underlying issues. What you see from oppositional defiance is arguing, defying authority, vindictive behavior, temper, and all that kind of stuff. But often what's underneath is depression, or anxiety, or a learning disability, or a speech language impairment. And some of you are speech language therapists. And some of you are, are teaching reading or math. The two most overlooked conditions for ODD in terms of underlying conditions are learning disabilities and speech language impairments. So the important part to note about that is if you can get to the underlying issues and help that kid become more successful, overcome their impairment, or at least deal with it. Their oppositional behavior often improves, simply because they're functioning better. The catch is they're oppositional behavior often covers or clouds the fact that they have a deficit underneath. Okay, so it's important to try to get control of behavior first before we can get to academics or other issues. ADHD is a medical condition that involves 12 primary characteristics. Now there's different types of ADHD. There's hyperactive. There's impulsive. And there's an attentive. Or there's a combined type. And… and on paper, ADHD looks pretty uh…simple. Somebody is hyper, they are impulsive. They don't pay attention. They forget their stuff. They blurt things out. They interrupt. They talk all the time. They're easily distracted. On paper, it looks very familiar. And I'm sure you see ADHD on paper, and you go, "Yeah, yeah, I know these kids." But in real life what ADHD looks like can feel very oppositional defiant, and so those two ODD and ADHD kind of combine with each other. And I see some of your not in your head yeah, uh-huh. And so umm…it becomes difficult to figure out what is this kid? Are they oppositional or the ADHD whether they need? And the reality is that ODD and ADHD exists together quite a bit called comorbidity. So you'll see that disorder. Those two disorders kind of hit each other. More complicating is the treatments for each one. The treatment, number one treatment at least in this country for ADHD, does anybody know? Stimulant medication, right. And non-stimulant medication is next. So what happens though you're gonna hear me bash on medication here a little bit. And I'll try to be calm about it. What happens when you put somebody that's not truly ADHD on an ADHD medication? Well, it can cause agitation, and irritability, and all that kind of stuff. And so we end up with our treatment. Sometimes causing bigger issues because there's kids that have ODD that are on ADHD medication. And there's kids that are that have more ADHD, that are treated as if they have ODD. So they're putting it into a behavior room or something like that, or they're put on lots of behavior modification programs when really that's not what they need, you know, they need lots of movement. And kids with ADHD need, need different things in kids with ODD. Umm… the number one problem in this country with kids is poor sleep. Okay, so which is, I know, probably not what you expected me to say in a, in a conference about behavior. But kids in this country are poor sleep patterns. One of the reasons is medication issues stimulants definitely interrupt sleep patterns. Uh… Another one of the issues is just kids going to bed too late. Their circadian rhythms are different. Another one of the problems is of course, videos and phones, and all that kind of stuff so that's their thing you'll hear me rant about today a little bit of technology and how as well useful as it can be. Technology is often our enemy when it comes to getting kids to behave well. So we have a big problem in the country with, with kids getting poor sleep. They're coming to school exhausted. Of course, poor sleep causes issues with concentration, causes issues with your memory. It's hard to function well. And then it also, it's all also hard to stay active when you're exhausted. So we have a kind of number two problem with kids in the country is obesity. And we have lots of kids that are, that are really in poor shape. And that leads to this whole cycle of eating bad food, not exercising, not sleeping, of course, not performing well in school because they're asleep, umm…or their or their showing up late or whatever it is, or they're falling asleep during the most critical times. So umm…all this is connected because our treatment, sometimes cause other problems, so we have to be careful. I'm not saying that kids should never be on medication. But we need to be doing other things besides just throwing pills at kids and expecting that to work. Another thing that causes a lot of issues with kids is depression. And depression is a very common mental health condition. And what I'm showing you here on the slides is traditional signs of depression. This is what we look at is clinicians, I'm gonna look at the sadness and feelings of worthlessness, and hopelessness, helplessness, thoughts of suicide, and death, and then it goes all the way down to appetite issues and sexual problems. But for kids, depression shows up quite a bit different. And so depression in children and youth while thoughts of death, and dying, and suicide are common as, as with adults. Kids with depression or more likely be irritable to go into rages to have released sudden mood shifts. And so that's often interpreted as oppositional defiant behavior and not as depression. But it is likely depression. So later on the day, I'll give you information about what to do with kids with depression so that you can, you can help them. Anxiety is the most common of all mental health issues across all age spans. And so whether or not it's a disorder for someone is not necessarily the issue but anxiety is a contributing factor in nearly every area of functioning in school and behavioral problem. So umm…to generalize what I did was listed the behavioral indicators of anxiety. Now look at the first one, aggression. Aggression is a sign of anxiety. Now you go through this list task avoidance, running away, crying, tantrums, kids that freaked out, kids don't call it panic attack, they call it freaking out, right? Yelling, shouting, shutting down behavior, these are all signs of anxiety. So how do you know is anxiety the, the reason that the kid is acting this way or are they just acting this way because they want to and they're being oppositional. The true tell, the true way to measure is a child acting out because of anxiety or they just choosing to act out is in the somatic signs of anxiety. Stress, anxiety, and even trauma are all born in the brain. The brain is the central processing unit. But stress, anxiety, and trauma live in the body. The body is the indicator of how much stress you have, of how much anxiety you have, and even for trauma people experience trauma, trauma lives within parts of the body. So if you're highly stressed, you may have headaches, or you may be restless, you may have muscle tension, you may have difficulty breathing, or your heart might start racing. So a lot of these things will happen, and then we'll, you know, obviously you'll feel something from that at which in turn, you know, leads to this cycle. So that's how you tell is this kid acting out 'cause this stuff is just really hard to fake. You could probably fake it for a little bit. But when your stress your body gives to, gives the answers. Trauma is much more common than we think unfortunately with young people. We've got several facts here that, I think, are kind of eye-opening for a lot of people. Especially if you're not used to working with people that are, are involved in trauma. More than 25% of American youth experience a trauma by their 16th birthday. And many kids experience multiple and repeated traumas. Common sources of trauma can involve, of course, child abuse and neglect, serious accidental injury, and even things like disasters and terrorism. Experiencing or witnessing violence can be just as devastating. Violence could be at a school, could be at home. And even treatment for a medical condition as a life-threatening issue can be very traumatic. After a crisis or a traumatic event, a child is at risk of developing traumatic stress. About 25% of victims and witnesses of violence develop, what's called PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression or anxiety disorders. And the reason that kids are so vulnerable to trauma is because of their size, and their age, and their dependence on adults. So whereas an adult may be able to leave a situation or get out of that situation because they're an adult and they can do what they want. A child of course, is not able to do that. And they might be stuck in it in a situation or with caregivers that are actually the cause of the trauma. And they depend on those caregivers to, to survive. Prior trauma pass mental health problems or a family history of such problems also increases a child's risk. In a national survey 12% to 70% of youth a 12 to 17 year old youth. I'm sorry. 8% reported a lifetime. Okay, prevalence of sexual assault 17% reported witnessing. I'm sorry reported physical assault and 39% reported witnessing. So looking at a survey of elementary middle school students in an inner-city community, 30% witnessed stabbing, and 20 to 6% have witnesses shooting. And a bigger sample of middle, and middle, and junior high students 2,248 to be exact. 41% had witnessed stabbing or shooting in the past year. Those are pretty those are pretty significant numbers. Uh…the signs of trauma in elementary age are listed here. And if you look at this list, it's a, it's a really long list, so some of these things could be interpreted incorrectly looking at it as. Well, the kid is just choosing to act this way. They're just choosing to be not here. They, they must have, you know, a diet, mental health problem uh… when it's really trauma. Okay, so one of the first things that we should looking at and what I am advocating for across the country is for school districts to add to their screenings uh…in addition to the other things that we do and, and schools do tremendous uh… screenings for, for hearing, and vision, and medical issues, and learning disabilities that speech language impairments. We just do wonderful things but we need to add trauma screening to, or I think, our intakes at different schools starting, starting as young as we can do it and do that throughout because honestly a lot of times trauma is caught by school people because you, you have kids so long. You know, you have them seven hours a day, six hours a day. And so you've got, you've got them a third of their day. And we get to see them. We get to, get to know them. And yeah, you know, and you hear things that they say. And you see what they do. And so I think, trauma screenings in school would definitely be helpful. And I'm gonna advocate for that. Umm…trauma in the secondary aged 13 and up also has a quite a long list, a little bit different than the younger kids. Some of the things are the same, of course. Some trauma facts things to think about and how it impacts students. One out of every four kids, attending school, so we're back to our over 25% number has been exposed to a traumatic event that kind of impact learning and behavior. So sometimes there's the question of in school, okay, well, we're not clinicians, what are we supposed to do about trauma? You know, okay, I… there's nothing I can do about it. And, and what should we do? And sometimes, there's a question of should we do anything? Well, yes, because trauma hijacks, academics, trauma impacts learning. We know fact, trauma impacts school performance. It lowers GPA. There are higher rates of school absences when somebody has experienced trauma. It's an increased dropout for those of you working in high school settings so umm…more suspensions and expulsions. We have a big problem in this country with suspending and expelling kids too much. And kids with trauma are often the ones getting suspended and expelled, decreased reading ability. Trauma fact, trauma can impair, impaired learning in a nutshell how this happens is the trauma part of the brain the part that experiences emotions and fear hijacks the cognitive part of the brain. And so when your cognitions are hijacked by the fear, the emotional part of the brain, you can't remember things as well. You can't process as well. You can't learn. And you certainly can't focus and concentrate. Just especially if you're thinking about what has happened to you, or you having flashbacks, or nightmares, and you can't sleep so it gets back to that. So uh…that's certainly gonna impact somebody's ability to perform in school on multiple levels. Umm… and, of course, that leads to feelings of frustration and anxiety 'cause you're falling behind. You don't know things. Uh…it becomes difficult. You get a failing grade. Or you don't get a, you don't get the nice mark on your goal sheet or whatever it is. And of course, that leads to frustration, and then of course, it leads to depression as well. A little side note that you, you can almost make an assumption that if somebody has trauma, they have elements, sometimes very powerful elements of depression as well. So that's a… that's kind of a double whammy that hits people. But if you treat the depression and, and trauma together, then they have a pretty good outlook. So another fact traumatized children may experience physical and emotional distress. So physical symptoms like, headaches and stomachaches which can also be interpreted as, you know, well, they're just sick. But our body is connected to our brain, of course, and like I said before the symptoms live in the body. Umm… so you can see impulsive behavior. You can see erratic behavior. You can see real intense reactions to situations. You can see, you know, blurting out things, and kids that are very sensitive to personal space. All right, so that's a quick rundown of some of the big areas impacting their kids in school. So any, any questions about that part so far? All right, I'm gonna move on to the next section. And I… I try to make that first section quick enough but hopefully informative enough 'cause if you're not a clinician, some of that stuff can be, oh, wait a minute, this is, this is get, get, getting kind of big. And if you are a clinician, maybe it's, maybe it's review but I think it's important to, to kind of know some of those general categories before launching into the other part. I'm gonna talk about behavior because I'm talking about kids today with and without a diagnosis. So I don't wanna be stuck on. Well, this kid doesn't have a label so therefore we can't do anything. So let's just talk about behavior in general. Behavior has a job to do. And the job of behavior is in general to get you something, to help you avoid something, and the behavior is always communication. All right, so I may gain attention through my behavior. I may get an escape from math assignments. Okay? Because I don't like math. So… so I escape from those type of assignments. Umm… I may communicate frustration with learning a particular skill. If we're changing behavior, so we're assuming that these behaviors are bad. Let's say, they're disruptive to the environment. If we're changing behavior, then the child needs a different way to gain something. So let's call a replacement behavior. They need another way to escape or avoid things. And we needed to teach the person to use language to communicate rather than behavior. All right, so those big three another way to gain something, another way to avoid or escape, and teach the person to use language to communicate rather than behavior. I was presenting this was quite a while ago is presenting to a group once and I had made a statement like this and somebody raised their hand and said, "I disagree with you, Scott." And I said, "Well, why do you disagree with me?" That… that to me seems pretty simple. And they said no. Behavior only does two things. You gain something, or you avoid something. That's what behavior does. And so I walked out of the room. I didn't say anything. I just walked out of the room. And then I came back in. And I said, "What am I behavior just tell you?" Now there was a, I don't know there was 75 or 100 people in the room. Okay. So we have let's just take an average 80 people, 85 people have to interpret that behavior 'cause I didn't tell him why I was leaving the room. I didn't give him a visual. I didn't do anything. I just left. All right, but if I'd have told them I'm leaving the room because then it's not subject to interpretation. I'm using language or I could point to a visual, right? You know, I could give them a hand signal I need a break or whatever it is because that's language. See, we understand language. We, we have to interpret behavior and often we interpret it incorrectly. All right, we come into the world, you know, babies come into the world communicating through the only language that they have which is their cry, right? And then we work with them, and work with them on using language. So I understand what you're saying, and then they, they start talking. All right, and when they start talking, it's a big deal because finally its, its language that we can truly understand. They say water we know what it is. They don't have to cry to get it. We know, oh, you want water. It's so easy, isn't it? And then they start using a lot of word, then we want them to be quiet. But you know, umm…kids with behavior issues often umm… have trouble communicating and kids on the autism spectrum. Uh… Autism is a communication disorder. It's a language disorder. So the very nature of it implies that there's going to be an impairment in communication so of course, we have to work with kids on the autism spectrum with language because the behavior is again interpreted often incorrectly. So if we're changing behavior so we're gonna do a replacement behavior. There are two primary behavior shifts that occur when we're changing a behavior., Type one, first-order change is the initial change that you engage in when we first change the behavior. It's kind of like stepping on the gas in your car. You go a little faster. All right, as soon as you let up, you slow down, right? Second-order change is shifting gears. It's a paradigm shift. It is a sustained activated change, all right, easier said than done. Think of a behavior that you've had that you have changed, what did it take for you to do that? Think of a behavior that you've had that you want to change but didn't haven't done it yet? What stopped you? All right, let's, let's use something that a lot of adults can relate to. Let's… you know, getting in shape or losing weight or, or, or whatever it is. Your doctor says, "Hey, should, you know, you should lower your cholesterol. Or you should lose weight. Or you should." Whatever okay, so okay, I'm gonna go on a diet, right? Anyway and you're excited about going on a diet. And you've decided I'm gonna do the weeds, and seeds, and hot water diet. I'm gonna, I'm gonna eat weeds, and seeds, and hot water. And that's it. I wanna do it. And you're motivated. And it's, and you put it on Facebook, and the whole thing and you've told everybody about how awesome this is gonna be. And then on the fifth day, and I don't know about this. And you're back to pizza, and ice cream in or whatever it is. And we've all gone through those phases where we kind of got excited about something. And we're gonna do it, and then we go slip back in the hallway because we don't like change. Really change is hard. We get stuck in how we do things even if it's not good for us, we kind of do it. But imagine if you, you kind of got through that first phase. You kind of got started, but then forget the weeds and seeds diet. That's a bad idea. And I don't know if that's even a real thing I just made it up. But let's say you've increased your exercise. And you stopped eating so much sugar. And gradually you lose the weight or your, your cholesterol comes down. Your doctor says, "I have really good results. What did you do?" Well, of course, that's gonna feel good, but you made a sustained second-order change. You actually shifted gears. In therapy, this is what we want our clients to do. We do want paradigm shifts that's what we're after. All right in education, the axis is what you want. You don't want the, you don't want the student just to memorize the stuff just to regurgitate it on tests. You want them to learn concepts and processes you become critical thinkers and develop over time. That is second-order change as well. Well, thinking about how hard it is to change our own behavior, what does it take to change somebody else's behavior? It's, it takes an effort beyond simply just telling somebody. Oh, this is what you need to do because if it was that easy, you would tell the child who's acting out. Hey, you need to be better because, and then they a light bulb would go off. And they go, "Oh, yeah, I'll be better because you told me to." That would be nice but it doesn't work that way. What it, what it takes is first understanding why is somebody doing what they're doing? What's the function of their behavior? What are they getting? What are they avoiding? Right? What are they communicating through their behavior? What is the origin of it? Because if I'm gonna put in a replacement behavior, it has to meet that same function. If I'm trying to get attention, if your attention is so important to me that I will act out to get it how can you teach me to get your attention by being behaving well? All right, because if that's what's important to me, I will seek it out. All right, and I need to be motivated to do so. So first we're gonna talk about causes of behavior. All right, and then later on, I'll talk about motivation because positive behavior reinforcement is critical. The first critical piece is understanding causes of behavior 'cause then you have the best chance for more lasting change and understanding the driving forces and needs buying behavior that the first reason, the most common reason why any of us do what we do is our anxiety or fear responses. The emergency response system in your body 'cause it's connected to your brain will save your life if you're in danger. This is the thing that activates fight, flight, freeze and submit. Okay, so let me give you an example, we're out, you're out in a wilderness, and we're hiking and a, and a bear comes after you. And the bear wants to do what bears do. Some of you will fight the bear. Some of you will run from the bear. Some of you will freeze. Some of you will give up play dead or faint. Some of you might do all those things. If you're a bear trainer, then you know what to do with bears. But if you're and your fear is going to be less, because you have ability in that area. But most of us are gonna freak out. And we're gonna be terrified because we don't wanna die. In that moment, our fear response takes over everything in our body. We become very strong. We become very fast. If we're a runner, we become numb so our pain threshold increases drastically. So we don't feel small little pain like, we normally would when we're not in that stress state because our body has a natural painkiller. And it's called cortisol. We become hyper focused. And we're not thinking about what we're doing today or tonight. We are thinking about survival. Our digestive system shuts down. Our muscles become stronger. Okay, our heart rate increases. Our breathing capacity decreases, lots of things happen. And that's all good. Okay, because that's a survival thing. Hopefully, we survive later on our body starts notching down. And you're gonna feel drained, and exhausted, and all that my probably sick and all those things but you survived. You didn't become bear food and life is good… as… as good as that system is it keeping us alive. It's also, one of the systems that tricks us and hijacks us the most because what if you have a non-survival fear something that you're just kind of afraid of but it's not threatening your survival. And we all probably have them. Some people have anxiety about speaking in front of other people. Some people have anxiety about flying. Some people have anxiety about certain things like spiders, or mice, or what, or whatever. And what happens in those cases is the fear part of the, the survival part of the brain hijacks the logic part. So let me give you an example. Let's say, you have a fear of spiders. All right, and a spider comes crawling along, the logic part of the brain understands is that spider not a threat. The spider is a good thing. And the brain knows that, but you kill the spider. Dead, totally irrational. Why? I don't like it. Afraid or I go running out of the room. I'm terrified by the spider. Or I stare at the spider 'cause I don't want the spider to move. So I freeze. Or I pass out. You know, or I just give up and let the spider do whatever it wants. All right, so as kids get older, and they, you know, move forward in life. A lot of times, they develop irrational fears based on situations that they get into just like we did. Sometimes they learn from us, things to be afraid of that they weren't afraid of before. Sometimes things happen to them that make them afraid. Life tends to do this. So it's important to understand that fear, anxiety even with the toughest of kids. The kids that appear to be that the biggest bullies that are causing the greatest disruption. I can almost guarantee you, it's hard to guarantee things in life but, but this is one of those things that they have some anxiety underneath, okay? Escape is different from flights. It's not a fear-based thing. This is more a task avoidance type escape. I want control. I am confused. I don't… I… I… I'm out of here. This is too hard. Okay, I want attention. Now there's two primary types of escape physical escape those of you that have a classroom, you get a student that leaves your classroom. Very frustrating! And I know, you're nodding your head that, that I mean, that is probably one of most frustrating things you have a group of 25 kids and one of them bolts. What are you supposed to do? All right, I stay with the 24, got one foot in the room, one foot in the hallway, do I chase the other one? I leave my 24 kids. It's really a bad situation that's physical escape. But emotional escape is much more common. Emotional escape is physically the person's there, but emotionally they've checked out. So I like to, I like to, this is a very nice group but I like to pick on people once in a while with this one. Umm… and those of you that are watching online can, can laugh to be because what, what happens so much now with, with people there's they're staying right where they need to stay but what does everybody seem to have that is an, an excellent source of escape. And nobody's doing that here so I can't pick on you because you're all very nice. Phones, right? People have their phones out in there. And if you teach high school or middle school, every kid seems to have a phone. It's amazing. I mean, they have wonderful phones, smart phones that do these crazy things. It's just wild enough. And they're using them in the middle of a discussion. I was out to eat, not too long ago by myself, I was traveling and I was at a restaurant and pretty nice place. And I looked and here's two people sitting there. Looked like a date of some sort, and they're both on their phones. They're probably texting each other that's what I assumed. And so let's escape. We do have a new, I sound old when I say this but we do have a new generation of, of people that communicate primarily through texting. And that has changed in many ways how people develop friendships, and relationships, even how they break up. It's also changed our interactions as a dolt towards kids and back. We now have to compete with technology. And so and there's, there's a whole other thing that goes along with this that the privilege of getting the phones and in the first place and how that, and how that happens, and what is it doing not just, not just smartphones, but technology like the video games, and all this kind of stuff? What is it doing to kids' development? Because we know that it interrupts sleep patterns. We know that it causes obsessive tendencies. If you've ever known a kid that was reluctance or refusing to shut down their, their computer activity, they become obsessed with it and become very agitated with it. And so escape is much bigger than just a kid leaving the classroom, it's a very encompassing issue. Attention, attention seeking behavior is very commonly put on functional behavior assessments and behavior intervention plans as, as it's a common behavior. And we need to look at it because when, when somebody is seeking attention, there's a reason they're seeking attention. There's a reason they want attention from an adult or from peers. Often there's this, there's a need of nurturing. Kids are missing something. They need somebody to love them. They need somebody to care about them. They want somebody to pay attention to them. Even if it's negative, who cares? That's better than being neglected. Neglect is one of the most damaging things that can happen to not just a young person but to an adult too. Solitary confinement is one of the most psychologically damaging things that that we do in correctional settings two adults and two kids. We used, we still use solitary confinement in juvenile detention facilities. And I think, it's a, it's terrible that we do that. I hope, it's banned at some point. And, and sometimes they don't call it a solitary, solitary confinement but that's what it is, you are alone. You are confined and you are solitary. I mean, you aren't around other people. And you get to come out once a day but you're still not around other people. What happens to you when you are neglected, is that you are in your own head. And if you are on the verge of psychosis, solitary confinement will cause psychosis to bloom. All right. Uh…so my point of saying that is kids seek out attention for a reason. They also seek out attention to have a sense of belonging, to have a sense of purpose, a sense of structure. Why are gangs so popular for young people? Well, there's a sense of purpose. There's a sense of belonging. There is a structure. There is hierarchy. There are rules. You know, there's rules to get in gangs, there's rules to be in the gang. And there's rules to get out of gangs. And we say here these kids that are breaking rules all the time. And they don't like authority and all this stuff. Yet they join a gang with all sorts of rules and codes of conduct and ways that we do things, and ways that we don't do things. Okay. So attention-seeking behavior, big one, this one's called integrated causes looking at a child behavior from a common-sense point of view. Now as a mental health clinician, I'm, I'm kind of weird to look at what is the mental health piece of somebody? But I need to think outside the box. I can't just assume that everybody that comes to me has a mental health condition. And that it's all psychiatric and that's nothing else. The first thing I need to look at if I'm going to be reasonable and honest about really looking at kids behavior is their basic needs or their basic needs being met. Are they hungry? Are they thirsty? Are they tired? If one of those needs hasn't been met, that need has to be met before anything else. All right, so a… a… a kid comes to school late. And they've missed breakfast. What are we gonna do? Well, I'm, I'm gonna hold their breakfast back. So the first thing that they do, the first thing they experience when they get to school is a greeting, welcome, thanks for coming. All right, the second thing that's gonna happen right after that is let's eat breakfast. Why because you got to eat. I don't care where you go in the world, what culture you're from, you got to eat. You gotta eat or you'll die. You got to have water or you'll die. You gotta have shelter, right? The… this is our basic survival needs. And it also binds us together. It connects us regardless of where you're from. So it's a universal thing that we all have. After this, we all live in a physical capsule that's called our body. And if something's not right, if we're sick, let's say, well, we're not gonna feel good. If we have a medical condition, that's going to have psychological implications. If I have umm… a medical condition, I might not feel very good. I might be in pain or so on and so forth of course, that's gonna have issues. And, and that's gonna impact my performance. But we all have sensory issues. If you're living and breathing, you have sensory issues. And occupational and physical therapists are… are…are great to have around because they're experts at, at dealing with sensory issues with people that have a lot of sensory issues. But we can all help kids with their sensory issues. You know, let them move around, recess that type of stuff, bless you, is a dealing with a sensory issue. If you're cold, will you warm up? If you're warm, you wanna cool off so on and so forth. And sometimes we don't make the most reasonable of accommodations. I was just reading in the paper about a teacher she had a classroom. And she found a bunch of those exercise balls. You know, those like a big ball you just sit-ups and things on 'em. And so she got him for her classroom. And those are pretty comfortable to sit on if you're younger (inaudible ) than hard chairs and stuff like that. And then she developed because there's always people that say, "Oh, he can't do that because kids will be bouncing everywhere and so." You know, why not give it a try that was her philosophy. Why not try it? And then she put rules around it. All right, so she has a system. Red light means, now imagine if you're all on bouncy balls, now if you're all bouncing on your ball right now, I'm gonna be, "Oh, this is… this is getting a little bit much here." I got a… a… a… a… it's like a bunch of roomful of minions. I got everybody bouncing around. So if I said red light that means everybody would stop. Okay, yellow light means you can bounce a little bit. Green light means we're gonna get up we're gonna exercise that we're gonna do different fun things with the ball. All right? And then when it's time to put it away, you know, lock and load. They're gonna put your ball under the table, or on the table, or whatever, whatever the procedure is, put your materials away and away we go, and think about the noise reduction? If you've got a hard tile floor with chairs that are screeching across the floor compared to a soft rubber ball, you know, and what's the worst that's gonna happen? Maybe somebody throws the ball. Well, if you've ever had chairs… chairs thrown at you, and I have had chairs thrown at me, I'd rather have a ball thrown at me than a chair. So umm…just something simple like that is a sensory accommodation for 25 kids all at once. All right, and it's fun doesn't have to be something that's really difficult to do safety, security, and stability. We all need to feel safe, we all need to feel secure in whatever environment we're going in. Now I didn't make this stuff up. Maslow figured this out a long time ago and as a pyramid say, "On the bottom of the pyramid, our basic needs what I just talked about our physical selves, and then we have to feel safe." If you're doing trauma work, safety is paramount. When you have a classroom, you set rules, and procedures, and guidelines for how we're gonna do things that creates safety. All right, when you're a clinician, and you're working with somebody more one on one, the first thing that you do is absolutely do no harm. That is your oath. The second thing is you create an environment of safety and that could involve informed consent, and confidentiality, and all that. But you, your client, your patient needs to feel safe before they're gonna share anything with you. If you go to your doctor, and you don't feel safe with your doctor, and your doctors saying, "These… these are the treatments you need. Or these are, this is a procedure I wanna do. You're not gonna want to invest much in that recovery or maybe not even return but you don't feel safe." Okay, mental health, emotional health, and, and grief or next but look at, look at where it's at on the spectrum way down the list. So as a mental health clinician, I need to think outside the box and realize that before I go to diagnosis because I do have to diagnose. Then I need to think what else is there. Unfortunately, kids go through grief, many types of grief. Grief is the loss of someone, or something, or the potential loss of someone, or something. Simply switching schools can be a grief issue. Your parents get divorced is a grief issue. Your parents are not dead but the marriage is and so that is a grief issue. And we all go through stages of grief differently. All right, so that's important something be sensitive too. And then of course, we all have a personality and that definitely plays into how we behave. And we all come from an environment. I heard somebody say in one of the last seminars, "Well, we have so many kids that come from really difficult environments and, and difficult situations and, and so what do you do with that?" Well, it would be nice if I could wave your magic wand and changed their neighborhood, and changed their home, and all that. But we don't have the power to do that. But do you have the power to do something about the environment that you have absolutely? My karate school can be whatever environment, I decided to be. And so I try to make it as nice of an environment as possible. So you know, go back to the basics, does it look good? Does it smell good? Does it feel good? Does it feel safe? Is it safe? Yes. Are their reasonable accommodations there? Yes. There's bathrooms and, and there's water, and sometimes we even have snacks and, and there's sensory items in there, and there's all sorts of things. Let me give you an example there's a ripple quick example of, of thinking outside the box. This is a case I had recently that I thought was very interesting uh…kind of how it happened this? This boy had been suspended from school. He got into a big altercation with another student which was a bit unusual. Umm… it never quite gone got physical with anybody. And pretty bright kid, a pretty grumpy kid though umm…and so things had been building to the culmination of okay, now there's a suspension. So I… I do my intake and, and all that stuff and, and trying to figure out what's going on because like I said I practice what I preach. And I'm kind of going through this and uh…get to the, get to kind of medical piece. And I'm going something's not, something's not right. And I… and I… and I had him out of the session. I talked to mom. And I said, "You know, my hunch is, I think, your, your, your son's got some allergies. You know, and I'm not an hour just, I'm not a doctor but I have allergies so I… I guess, I'm sensitive to that and so. I said, "You know, before we… we go on with any type of behavior interventions or even with counseling, I really don't want him in counseling yet. I certainly don't want him on psyche, psychiatric, psychotropic meds I don't think that's the route to go. Umm… and she's getting pressure from the school to do something. So we have to be honest about what's going on here. And so my job in that, in that situation is to give mom the best recommendation I can and also tell the school to call him down a little bit. Because it's not gonna get fixed overnight. This didn't happen overnight. But we kind of expect results overnight, which is one of the reasons why people want to go to the medication right away, they want the instant answer it needs to be better now. But if they really honestly look at it, this problem started, it had built up. You know, we'll just so with mild, mild, you know, issues. And it kind of builds up and kind of don't do anything, kind I don't do anything, do anything, and then boom! A big thing happens. Now we wanna do everything right away. You know, we could have prevented a lot of these issues if we did probably, you know, done some better programming. So well, once there are things I do which does frustrate people some time is tell them "just wait, hold on," let me think about it. People don't like hear that. They want, they want an answer. Umm… so what I did was I referred uh… the boy through his mom to an, an allergist, an allergy clinic. And what I… I spent time with in the session with the boy getting him ready to go to the allergist, so we did spend do couple counseling sessions about what's gonna, you know, what if you've ever been to an allergist, you know, you get poked with needles and all that stuff. So the kid was kind of freaking out about this. And so we got him ready and turns out he's got all sorts of allergies and get, gets treated for, you know, for the allergies over time, I mean, as he's still going through the treatment. But he starts to feel better because he's not miserable. And he's sleeping better. So his mood is better. So his school behavior is better. Now okay, so as that rumbles forward in a good way that's gonna have all sorts of multiple impact is that due to psychiatric treatment. No. It's a medical issue that got started through counseling. But it wasn't my intervention that made him better. Is that make sense? So that's why I think it's important to think outside the box and to think in, in the common sense spectrum. The final category here I wanna, wanna hit is control. This was a big one with kids that are oppositional umm…especially oppositional defiant disorder. There's also a big one with kids with trauma and anxiety. Umm… they need to have control and power is a major factor in working with oppositional use and… and control though, this is really a difficult concept to get because a lot of people get mixed up with choice. They think, if we give kids choices, then they'll have control and they'll do better. But in many cases what we have is a problem with kids having too many choices, all right, and they're allowed to choose too much which overwhelms them and creates a sense of entitlement or privilege as if I get to choose, so we have the 4-year-old that won't eat anything unless it's sugary. Because they throw a fit, and then were, were panicking because they're gonna starve right and so we're just give them what they want. The 13-year-old that's allowed too much freedom because we could we just kind of do a hands-off thing, right? Well, they get to choose so the 13-year-old has Facebook, and they have a thousand friends on Facebook. There's 13-year-old on Earth that has a thousand friends. It's silly that they have a thousand friends on Facebook. You know, I… I told the parent one time I said, "Would you let your kid hang out with a stranger?" She was, "Well, of course, not." So why do you let him? Why you would let him do it on online? You let him play games with people he doesn't know, be Facebook friends with people he doesn't know, and Lord knows what, whatever type of interaction with people that he doesn't know that well. You wouldn't dream of letting him go to their, their house. Why do you let it happen online? Well, because it's different. No, it's not different. Okay. And that's too much choice. Choice becomes appropriate when we're emotionally and cognitively able to handle the ramifications of the choice. All right, and so younger kids need limited choices. You can eat or don't. Or if you eat your vegetables, then you get dessert that's about the lay the range of choice that the 4 or 5-year-old gets. Now they can throw a fit, and all that stuff and say, "I'm never gonna eat again." And a lot stuff, and then eventually they'll eat. But they're gonna get the brownie, or the cookie, or the sugary whatever. They gotta eat their vegetables or whatever it is. If not okay, no brownie, and they'll be upset and they'll froth from the mouth and the whole thing. And they'll be upset. And they'll go to bed, then they hate you and all that stuff within(ph). Then the next day, you'll be over it. I'm 13-year-old, maybe it's okay if they get Facebook but I'm going to limit their friends. So if you're 13, you get 13 friends. And 10 of those are family members so pick, you know, three other people that I know. Because if I see somebody on your Facebook, I don't recognize or any type of interaction that's questionable, it's done. It's just wiped out. You don't get it anymore. Well, because that's what I would do if I found out you were hanging out with some, somebody I didn't know or trust, I would eliminate that person in your life because I protect, I'm gonna protect you. Now if some people say, "Oh, that's tough love." That's not tough love, that's just love. It's just plain caring about somebody that's what you do. If you're the parent, that's what parent needs to do. So we need to empower parents more to be the parent not the buddy, not the pal, not the enabler because oppositional defiant kids have, have there's one group of oppositional defiant kids that the reason they're oppositional defiant is because of their parents. Now it's not all oppositional kids, kids are caused by their parents but there is a group out there that's getting bigger that are raised by different sets of parents. One set of parents is the hovering parent. The helicopter parent, you've probably heard about them, right? And they hover over everything. And they want to entertain their kids. And they, and they interfere in school. And they go to daycare, and they tell the daycare people how to do things. And they that they get mad at the soccer coach because it's just but he's a bad soccer coach. And then, you know, and they interfere with the piano teacher because she doesn't teach piano the way, I think, she should be teaching. And if my kid doesn't succeed, then I'm gonna pounce on you. All right, they're the ones that show up to school, to your school and say, "My daughter failed her spelling test again. It's your fault. See, it's bad teaching." That's the problem. So I'm gonna come to school, right? And I even saw the internet a while back there was a school that posted a sign at, at the front for parents. I said, "If you are here to drop off your kids, homework, lunch, coat, whatever please turn around and leave." Because they have so many kids, or parents coming in and constantly doing that stuff. I went to a school, recently to consult with the school. Ah…there, there are alternative school. And they, and they says, I start talking about as they said, "We got the same problem." Look at parents, showing up all the time and they're upset if they're oh, here are my son forgot his homework, you know, my daughter forgot her backpack, and such as so on and so forth. You know, I run a karate school. And if a kid it's sparring day, right, so if a kid forgets their sparring gear, they can't spar because it's required. You got to have the gear on. It's like playing football without a helmet. It's not gonna happen under my watch. And so they come in uh… and now mind you sparring is listed on the newsletter it's everybody knows when it is and so they just forgot their stuff. I understand. Now they can still do class. But they have to practice on their own, and they can't do sparring. And they're sad, and upset, and all this stuff but next time they remember there's sparring gear. Or we work out a little deal when we go, you know what? I've got a spot for you to keep your sparring gear here. Then you don't have to worry about it. Oh, I'd be cool. So now we've got a little, little deal going on. All right, this all goes back to control. Now there's another group of parents, they're like the… the kids movie that pirates that don't do anything. These are the parents that don't do anything. It's kind of let it happen. So… so you're at a restaurant, there's kids, running around. And there's kids under the table, and they're not your kids, right? They're their kids. But they don't say anything to them. Or you, you're in a store, there's kids running up and down the aisle, right? You, you, you've seen it. And then there's the passive aggressive parents, and stuff like that too. So there's a big problem with control and that, you know, it's been kind of overdone here that "Oh, let's just give kids choices. Let them choose everything. Let them have everything. Everybody will be better." I don't think its working. Control comes from feeling safe and secure. That's first. If I don't feel safe, I don't care how much choice you give me. I'm gonna be agitated. I'm gonna be upset 'cause it goes back to my fear response. So this loops back into the first one. So by the way as a, as a little segue way uh…what I've been doing with parents is recommending a book, and it's not a PESI book. So I'm not plugging PESI products, but it's a wonderful, wonderful book about parents. And the, the name of the book is called "the collapse of parenting." And I'm gonna give this guy a plug here on, on, on webcast because it's, it's such a great book. Leonard Sax is the author of the book SAX and Dr. Sax is a medical doctor and a psychologist. And in, in the book, he's talking about parents and obviously and how we are kind of ruining our kids by pushing them to grow up and by not setting good boundaries too. We've got to set good boundaries with kids. There's, there's a true misunderstanding about if we set boundaries with kids that they'll rebel against those boundaries and that that's what's causing this. Now we don't want to be so rigid, inflexible that we never budge. But we thrive on rules and boundaries. We live in a nation of laws. We live in it, you live in a city of ordinances. It keeps us from anarchy. And if you have a classroom, you need rules. You can't just say, "Everybody, do what you want." I mean, it doesn't work that way. So when I fly on the airplane, there are rules. Now I wanna everybody else to follow those rules because I don't want somebody to do things that they want them to do. I want this flight to go well. Okay. So umm…if you're working with parents that might be a good uh…book for you to, to recommend to them. So umm…I know, I read it in two days. I was just fascinated with it. So I'm moving towards changing behavior. I… I utilize a, a three-tiered process uh…set the stage for success. We want to umm…establish excellent reinforcement systems. Reactive behavior management is about reacting to behavior as it happens. We're gonna cover that a little bit more later. But in general, what we wanna do is assess for the cause of behavior just like, I've been talking about. And we're gonna go through that next is how to do that assess for motivation, and reinforcement, and create a plan, and it's safe and protective in nature. Now these are processes not necessarily events so to say, there's these are all connected together. So what I wanna do is give you several tools of ways to gather information about kids. Now all of you have different roles. Some of you do observations, some you are more directly working with students, some of you are doing interviews, some of you are doing collaborative work so you can pick and choose from these lists based on you, your role and what you would do. Umm… what to look for? This is information specific to observation. Obser… observing someone do behavior is one of the best ways to learn about them. Okay? So if I was called to your classroom, I would wanna sit in your classroom and watch and observe and look for these things. When I do observation, I like to do two or three observations. They get different samples. I look for on and off task behavior. And I just make a tally. You know, when, when they're on task, you know, if I'm doing a every minute sample(ph) then every minute I'm gonna make it, make a tally. Sometimes I can be structured like that, sometimes I'm just gonna take notes if they're on or off task. Duration, how long does the behavior last if I see it severity? I do everything on a scale of 1 to 10 so 10s… 10s the highest. If it's a 10 behavior, it is very aggressive. It's very dangerous so that's why I look at one behavior is, is annoying and bothersome. Five is… it's starting to get there. Eight, nine, ten, we're looking at probably not gonna be observing very long because it's dangerous. I'm probably gonna need to intervene. I look at what happens when the behavior happens? What's the environment like? Is it chaotic? Is it structured? Is it quiet? Is it loud? Is it where is the child sitting? Umm… where are the other kids sitting? Generally in a classroom, you've got other students. So what are the other students doing? Umm… is there any odd or out of place behavior? Odd means it just doesn't fit. It's just something's off here. If you get that feeling like, uh…something is wrong here, well, there's a reason it feels that way. I look at what are the other students doing compared to the student that I am observing is there something significantly different there is the behavior out of the range of what would be considered usual behavior for age and developmental level. Okay. Interviewing, this is an informal interview. Let's say the students have left, and now I get to meet with the teacher of that classroom. I want to ask these questions, "When does the behavior happen? Where does it happen? When? What? How? Why?" Okay, those are all important. Umm… and it might be multiple so maybe, maybe the wind question is well, it happens at 10 o'clock, it happens there at 11 o'clock, it happens, you know, at these different times the, the where obviously location what is describing the behavior how is the process of behavior. And you can even get into antecedents, you know, behavior impact so looking at, okay, well, this kind of this is these are triggers, this is the behavior, and this is what happens. Important part is why do they think this child is acting the way they're acting? I need to get their opinion on this. They know the kid better than I do. Now I could ask that to a parent as well I could ask that to an administrator, I could ask that to anybody that knows the kid. So there's no limit to this. I'm just gonna take notes. And I'm gonna be looking for themes. If I start getting that every day at 10:30, this kids acting out well, what's going on at 10:30 or what's going on slightly before that. I'm gonna start developing a pattern. Probing questions are designed to elicit more information there beyond just a factual answer, they really are that person's opinion and allows them to expand on especially when people are upset, probing questions are really good because it helps them get out there what they're upset about, right? So if I say if I could help your student with just one thing what would it be, generally I don't get just one thing, I get all this stuff. Okay, and then I have to try to kind of narrow it down. Okay, I'm seeing a theme here. Generally there's a theme of its non-compliance, right? They're driving me crazy. That's generally the theme. All right. Collaborative information is designed to be more structured. I am interviewing parents, or uh…since we're in schools a lot, a teacher, you know, educational staff information so this is the first form that I have for you that is really for a parent to fill out. And if a kid is old enough I'll, I'll give them a copy, and let them look at it too. They have to be old enough to read it obviously and, and look at it. And I… I don't think, I've ever had a kid say, "No, I'm not doing it." Uh…sometimes it the words, some of the words can be a little bit big but another not. Umm… I can actually go through it with the parent or just give it to the parent. My preference is just give it to them, and let them fill it out at their leisure rather than me asking every single question. But the first part of it's very factual. And you just check the little bubble, okay, just stuff that applies, and they can write in next to it. And then the second part is a symptom problem checklist. And what they're doing here is looking at different problems or symptoms checking the bubble if it's something that applies and circling the one, two, or three. The three is very problematic. One is mildly problem, problematic. And this goes on the next page. This allows me to triage or to prioritize where do I need to start because I… I as a mental health clinician, I think that's what's important is to prioritize first things first. If somebody is suicidal, nothing else matters until we deal with that. Okay? If they're in trouble with the law and they're on the brink of being sent away, then we're at a critical piece here. All right, maybe there's more medicals like the boy with the allergies, and stuff like that. Maybe it's more of a medical thing. And you know, I'm kind of looking at this going gosh. It's time to meet with a doctor here because this is not really looking like anything that I should be doing. Okay? Uh…what would they like to happen as a result of treatment? I'm a treatment provider so that's why I say treatment. You could easily change that to programming. All right, and what have they tried before to make things better? Okay, so that's the first one. This is a parent interview form that's pretty easy to use. Looking at, okay, we're so we got a behavior issue. What are the child's strengths? One of their interests, how do they learn best? All right, that's the top part 'cause I wanna go from a strength focus perspective, solution focus perspective what are the strengths that this person has, what are their assets because it's our strengths and our assets, or hopes, or dreams, or aspirations, those are the things that help us overcome our weaknesses, and the things that are holding us down. The behavior occurs when what is your reaction to the behavior, and what things are reinforcing for your child. Because to change behavior, we're gonna have to have a reinforcement plan that sparks the change and keeps us to change sustained. This is more of a long-form interview. Asking questions, again you could do this as a structured interview or give it to the parent as something that they could just fill out. This is student interview I would probably do this with the student unless they are just a really good reader and, you know, are willing to go, go through and write this down. But you guys think about a lot of kids that I'm working with, they have writing disability, writing is hard, reading can be hard so this would be frustrating. (inaudible ) and if they're not a reader and you're looking at pictures, this is, this would not be appropriate. So I wouldn't wanna do this for them, or with them. Another student interview form a, a little bit easier uh…starting with school, umm…a lot of kids just think school is too hard. Okay, uh…so that's the first one, how do they learn best? Okay. Now we're looking at some uh…behavioral patterns. I do the behavior when, I don't do it when, and then my reinforcers. Kids don't really understand what reinforcers are so just call it rewards. All right, my rewards are. Next form is a, is a teacher interview form again. So strengths, interests, how they learn best, behavior occurs when, how do you react to behavior, what things are reinforcing for your student, okay? So then we're gonna look at a, a couple other forms here in a bit. I… I didn't mention earlier. And I'll mention it now so I don't forget. All the forms that are in the, in the presentation you're welcome to use. You can use those, copy those directly. I can't send them to you electronically but you can, you know, copy what you have or borrow them and alter them so they work in your environment. Uh…the only time you need my permission is if you're going to publish them. And they need permission but I… I want people to use the, the form so if you find one of those particularly helpful or all of them hate that's why I'm doing the seminar. So okay, so looking at changing behavior, look at defining the behavior or so, so a simple definition would be what did the child get, where they avoid, and what are they communicating. We wanna teach new skills soon as possible. So if we've identified that there's a skill deficit with it with the kid. Well, we need to start right away. Let's not wait until we've got our whole plan together, let's start right away. A skill deficit could mean, it could be something like these, they're impulsive. They just can't stop themselves from blurting things out. So we're gonna work on impulse control right away. A skill deficit academic could be a reading issue. Oh, let's, let's figure out what that is and let's, let's go back to what they know and then move forward again. Really an education and behavior, we look at two primary deficits. If you can just boil it down into two areas, there's skill deficits, and there's performance deficits. A skill deficit is simple. I don't know how to do it. Okay, so for instance, I don't know how to speak Chinese. It doesn't matter how much you punish me or reward me, I can't do it. So you can create the best plan in the world. Doesn't matter I can't do it so you have to go back to what I do know, and then teach me how to do it. So then you could see how well I perform it. The second type of deficit is a performance deficit. I do know the skill, but I can't necessarily perform it to the best of my ability. And there's, and there's different ways that that happens. Maybe I just can't stay on task very long. Okay, maybe I can't get started. Maybe I have poor organization. Maybe I have poor time management. Maybe I can't remember things. All right, and so later on, I might talk about that again. But those are different performance areas. When developing a plan, I wanna get engaged in type-1 change and type-2 change. So my reinforcement plan is going to have to fit both of those. So in the beginning, our reinforcement should be immediate and continuous, then we look at intermittent reinforcement, and then we look at delayed reinforcement. This seems so easy, but it's so often done incorrectly so I'm gonna, I'm gonna repeat it. Immediate and continuous reinforcement is what we should start with meaning a, a child does something. Let's say they, they follow directions when they're supposed to follow directions, right? I wanna immediately reinforce them with that. Maybe the reinforcement is my praise. You know, it doesn't have to be a tangible reinforcement the way we often think of it. It might just be, "Hey, I don't really appreciate you did a good job." That's immediate right, right now intermittent is when it happens on a regular basis like, your intermittent wipers in your car, you know, they… they happen at intermittent levels. It happens regularly. And delayed is it happens later but, but a child has to have the ability to delay, gratification so they have to be able to wait for it. If you're not mature enough to wait for it, then the plan won't work. So if junior gets extra computer time on Friday for being good all week because that's his reinforcer. But at Monday at 9:30, he's blown it already see the delayed reinforcer wasn't powerful enough. As we get older, we develop the ability to delay reinforcement, to delay gratification. It's part of our impulse control which is part of our brain development. But as we're young, we need right now. All right, and as we get older, we try to spread that out more. But we're trying to change behavior. Okay? We need to, we need to start with it immediate continuous intermittent and actually punishment if you real quick aside kind of works the same way. Punishment is designed to stop a behavior, make it not happen again. Okay. And so if a child does something, let's say the little toddler is gonna stick their finger in an outlet, you know, that's not a time where I'm gonna say, "Now is that a good choice, Peter?" If you do that you'll get in trouble that's would be silly. I don't think anybody would suggest that. We… it would be dumb, all right, to do that. So I'm gonna rush over there. I'm gonna yell at him. I might even slap their hand and move their hand if I can get to him to stop them from hurting themselves, right? And that's a punishment. And they're gonna be upsetting or crying a little. But hopefully, they're never do it again. And that's why I need to, you know, plug those holes so they don't do that. And then later on you, you don't have to have those things covered. As we get older, we experience sometimes delayed consequences or delayed punishment, and they still have a big impact. So when I'm 16, and I get my car, I'm driving, and I decide to do some things in my car I shouldn't do, maybe I racing around or whatever. And I get a ticket. Woo! Pay for it later, and maybe I… maybe I don't get my car for six months to learn my lesson. Maybe I was caught texting while I was driving. See, I understand because I'm old enough to put it together the reason I don't have my car now is because I screwed up here. All right, but before I would give a parent or even a school ideas about consequences, I wanna consider the source, intent delivery, and approach overall before delivering 'cause people love consequences. They love to have ideas about punishment. But if they don't have a positive behavior reinforcement system in place, forget it, I'm not gonna talk about consequences yet. Here's what we know about kids, especially kids that are aggressive, kids that are involved in the juvenile justice system. Uh…oppositional defiant kids is that approaches that utilize punishment, or even aggressive behavior, or kind of in your face try to intimidate kids, or coerce kids into being good, or scare them into behaving well, or use physical restraint for compliance where they're physically holding on the kids. Not only does it not help, it actually increases aggressive behavior. And so if kids are involved in and so, I think, like, probation, rates and recidivism actually go up as a result of approaches like that. So umm…we know it doesn't work. What works is a combination of positive behavior reinforcement, and also teaching kids how to manage negative emotions, how to knit, how to solve problems. If you're getting into a good behavior plan whether you write it down or you just have it, you know, I think, any good behavior plan is at some point going to involve or behavior management program is going to involve teaching kids social skills. This is indicated by the research and, and for kids with autism, it's vital for kids with oppositional defiant disorder. It's vital for kids with uh…academic functioning issues. It's vital. Your, your time teaching social skills will never be wasted. Okay? So for little kids those of you teaching little ones, of course, we're pretty good at this with little kids 'cause we teach them please, and thank you, and waiting in line, and take your seat, and open the door for people, and all that stuff, but we forget that social skills happens throughout the lifespan. So as kids get older, how to make friends, how to keep friends, how to disagree and… and solve a problem with your friends. Uh…older kids, how to have a relationship, how to break up, you know, a lot of people break up via text or Facebook even worse they put their relationship on there. Okay. How did negotiate? I mean, think about it, kid, a kid once a later curfew. Do they have the skill to negotiate that? Or they just demanding that I get this. All right! What about high school kids? Those are you working with high school kids, and what about job interview skills? Wow! Pretty important skill uh…that's social skills. Now for those of you that have dedicated social skills time keep it, protect it because there's people that wanna take it from us that… that… that seemed to think that learning a certain academic is more important than a social skill. If you don't have time to teach social skills, and sneak it in whenever you can because like I said, you're never wasting your time, and the impact of that last well beyond your work with that particular student. That's a skill that they will have forever. If you learn how to be a good negotiator, you learn how to interview for a job, and you actually get that, right? That's something that just keeps rolling for you. All right. And you all probably know adults that don't have good social skills. So what happened? Somewhere along the line, they missed out. Somebody didn't teach 'em. So start when kids are young uh…that's very important. So a plan of action decide on a behavior to change, does every behavior really need to be addressed, is that possible? I think, behavior plans that get too long and complicated, end up probably not being as effective rather than being very uh…consolidated and focused on, on what behavior do we want to change. As we're developing a plan what we're gonna do is put together the pieces from interview, from observation, all that collaborative information that's gonna help me develop a plan. Plans can be formal, or they can be informal. Formal plans are detailed. They are written down. They're typically attached uh…with a goal sheet or a tracking sheet of some sort. Uh…informal plans are more like a deal. They are a simple arrangement. Junior, when you do this, and I will do this. You and I have a deal. And we do a little fist bump. And it's as… it's… it's done. My preference is to use informal plans for highly oppositional kids as… and older students meaning secondary age 'cause they're more natural. They don't make you stick out and look different than all the other kids. Sometimes we have more behavior resulting from the intervention than we did before we had intervention. If you ever had that, you know, you had a student that acted out more when they have on their, on their goal sheet than they did before they had their goal sheet. The goal sheets a bad idea. All right, so we can't be so merry to I got to do this intervention, I get you this intervention, that's causing more problems than it's worth. There's nothing wrong with formal plans. Uh… except formal plans also have this element of expected involvement by a third party. For instance, let me give you what I example what I mean by that. Let's say the child is on a goal sheet, and that's attached to the behavior plan. The goal sheet needs to go home to the parents of the parent can sign off on it and do all that stuff. But that's assuming that that parent is going to do that on a dedicated basis. It's making an assumption that they can do it. It's making an assumption that they're not rigid or inflexible. It's making an assumption that everybody plays nice. So what happens when the goal sheets not signed? What happens when it's forgotten? What happens when the parent won't sign it? What happens in one case I had, actually was a seminar I was doing, and as soon as I started talking about this, a bunch of people in the back raised their hand. They said, "We have this case. We need you to hear about it right now." I said, "Okay." So we had a kid. He was 20%, 30% on his goals. It was a mess. She was, we've done a lot of work. And now he's 85%, 90%, 94% 95% on a daily basis. Here's the problem, Dad won't sign off on the goal sheet unless it's a 100%. So the kid is actually getting punished by getting 90%. Now think about that? All of us look at this. And you're shaking your head and going that "I'm happy," but unfortunately this is our reality, this is the world that many kids live in very cognitively inflexible people, obsessive where everyone we're gonna call it. Instead of dad looking at the that the huge gains, the kid is now getting punished for not getting 100%, coming to school upset because he's gonna get double-whammy, right? You come to school without the goal sheet sign, and who knows what happened to him at home? So they asked me what… what they should do when not knowing the case, I just said, "Stop saying the goal sheet home," because the gold sheet is now a source of pain, instead of a source of support. And I think, that's how you look at it. Is this raising somebody up? Or is it tearing them down? In my feeling, somebody's bucket up, am I making deposits in the bank? Or am I emptying their bucket, or making withdrawals? Which one is it? Because sometimes when I'm confused, and I don't know what to do, then I just think of it that way. Is this making somebody better? Or is it making them worse? If it's making them worse, I don't want to be any part of that. And I also don't want to be, honestly I don't want to be a part of anybody that is that rigid, or that obsessive, or that negative because I can't guarantee you what's gonna happen to that kid. So there's that's why there's a little bit of a danger in some of the plans that it's not one size fits all. And think about, if you think about yourself being a tenth grader, you know, if you can think back into those days. How would you feel carrying a goal sheet around? Two different, two different teachers and make and it had to be signed or you weren't gonna get to go, you know, hang out at rec time or whatever it was. Now first grader might allow carrying that goal sheet around, might be the best thing ever. You guys, think about as kids get older, and they're, you're more aware of their social connections, and they're more trying to fit in and kind of find their way in life what does it make them look like, so that's why informal plans can be pretty helpful as well. If you have a safety issue, then I suggest before you create any type of behavior or treatment plan, you create a safety plan. A behavior that's unsafe would be something that could result in harm to the student, or interventions that are potentially unsafe restraint being the number one intervention that we do with kids uh…where we were physically holding on to them preventing them from doing something. Well, and/or seclusion which is putting them in a room when they're by themselves. And those are called a lot of things. I call them safe rooms. All right. I suggest having a safety plan for four reasons. And the first two are pretty obvious. Safety of the child should always be the number one reason why we're doing a safety plan. Safety of other people, you'll notice the safety of property is not on there. I don't think restraining people for the purposes of, of, of protecting our property is necessary and even defendable, however, if the property damage could cause damage to someone, then I think, it goes to the safety of the child or other people. So a child that's throwing chairs in the room, I'm probably not gonna put my hands on 'em. Be honest with you. They're trying to put their hand through a window, absolutely I'm not gonna let them do that. A child that's running out into the hallway, I'm probably not gonna put my hands on. They're trying to run out of the street, of course, I'm gonna stop them. As much as I could to not get out in the street 'cause the potential for greater damage happens. All right, I think, we have to use our discretion. But I've seen kids restrained for taking their papers and throwing them up in the air and tossing, you know, tossing the stuff off a desk. No risk to anybody, but they were still restrained. The, the, their behavior that happens during the restraint is much more severe than what was happening before. I think the third reason is that a visual plan provides a system for us to follow during a crisis. I've taught lots and lots about crisis management. And what happens to people in a crisis is that our common sense gets hijacked by our fear. Stress makes us forget the most easy of skills. If you've ever, ever had to call 911, all right? You… you might forget your own address. They ask you your location, right? One of the first things that they wanna know where are you at. And you know where you're at but now you're stressed you can't get the words out. In unsafe situations with kids in crisis, we forget sometimes the easiest of remedies. And so having it written down provides us that security blanket. Okay, this is what I do. And if you have other people coming in to help you, then they know what to do as well. Because I think, not only is the unsafe situation stressful when somebody comes in and they shoot from the hip which means they just make it up as they go or they do it their way. I think that's unprofessional first of all. I also think it's dangerous. Can you imagine if you called the fire department the first an emergency and they, and they came, and they, and they go well. And they start talking about what you wanna do. I don't know I think, well, I'll do it my way today. Well, I would be terrible. They know what they're gonna do before they ever get there. They've got roles clearly established. And their job is to not figure out why the fire happened. They just put out fire. Then they do it to the best of their ability. If you go to the ER, can you imagine that the ER uh…doctor going well. What do you think is the problem? What would you like to do? Or they bring in some other person? Well, just do it your way today. And you'd be like, "Why?" You're gonna, you know, there's a system going on. So for psychological or, or emotional emergencies, we tend to kind of make it up sometimes as we go. And I don't think that's the most efficient system. The last reason is why you want a written safety plan is really to cover your own, cover yourselves, cover your rear end because when uh…you have a safety plan that's written down. And everybody signs off on it. You've got everybody in agreement. This is what we're gonna do. So nobody can come back on you then and say, "Hey I don't like what you're doing." Because you don't do the safety plan until the parent or legal guardian isn't, isn't contact about that. And that prevents that sets good boundaries. It puts the adults in the authority rule. And what, and that helps a kid feel safe. That it's not just somebody doing it. That everybody knows about it. That this is a, this is a safety plan. This is not a hurt you plan. This is an example of a safety plan that I developed for our school district. And it's a one page plan very simple to use. The first part of it is risk factors. There are risk factors that increase the probability of trouble during the safety plan like, the kid has trauma history, or they have an orthopedic issue, they have a health, they have asthma, something like that. That stuff needs to be noted up there. So if I come in to help you, I can look at that and go. This kid has, this kid has a sore shoulder 'cause they had a surgery or whatever. We got to be very careful with our left arm. Okay? They have asthma, you'd be very careful restraining somebody with asthma. They have a trauma history. We're not gonna put our hands on them at all. Or, or they have a neglect history. We're not gonna put them in a seclusion room because that would retraumatization them. What is the unsafe behavior, it just a very quick description of the unsafe behavior that's what kicks the plan in place. The second part is warning signs, triggers, and then strategies that work, strategies that do not work. The third part is what is the plan, and who's doing what. So what is, what is your role, what is my role, etcetera? Who's calling the parent, who's documenting? All that kind of stuff is all laid out. When you are considering a safety plan for a student that you work with whether you use my plan or, or not, that, that's up to you. But I think, you need to consider risk factors for them. Unsafe behavior, that is what a safety plan is used for. Triggers, what triggers that… that unsafe behavior because that's also the one of the best spots to be able to head it off is at the trigger stage. What helps? Very simply what are the strategies that help this kid be safe, what does not help? People also need to know that. So for instance, a typical thing in a crisis is to not talk very much. A, avoid questions. You don't wanna ask questions somebody's in a crisis. But that's one of the first things people do this. They walk in, and they'll start talking to the kid who's already highly escalated, who's screaming and hollering. And they'll say something like is this are, these good choices almost ridiculous things that ever happens. And when people are stressed, what they do? They talk louder, and they start talking faster. Okay, so they start talking loud and fast, and that's make, makes everybody's stress go up. Okay. Instead your voice needs to be calm, and you just slowed down. You need to moderate your own non-verbals. Okay, later on, we'll talk about crisis and stress situations. And so finally what is the plan? All right, so kind of keep your student, students in mind when safety planning. And sometimes if there's time, I'll, I'll kind of let people branch out in the, in the groups and kind of, kind of do this. But I'm gonna skip that part today. So I just want you to do that individually uh…'cause I wanna get to this next section here. Uh…it says, "Functional, functional assessment on top slash behavior change plan." These two forms go together. You know, it's actually a four-page thing but I just shrunk it into two. This first form is a place a way you can summarize your data, your, your interview information. So the child's behavior goes on top if, if those of you uh…some of you are working with parents, some of you are also working with other professionals, some of you're wearing three hats, so you have the kids or have professionals and the parents that you're working with, some of you're working with kids and parents, some of you're working with kids. So depending on your scope what you're doing, then you could put parent or provider information that up there as well. You're starting information is simply your data from observation, from interview what you're doing is you're summarizing here how often does the behavior occur. Okay, uh…how long does it happen? How intense is it? What are the triggers, what makes it worse, what are the impact of it? That's gonna feed the next set of questions which is, what the child get avoid or communicate through their behavior? So really the function of the behavior. Perhaps, there is secondary gain. All right, meaning an adult actually benefits somehow through this child's behavior. All right, and so a, a fun way to think of this is some people love chaos, they thrive in chaos. And so let's say this, this kid is providing their chaos. And we get this kid to start behaving better. Well, this adult that is in love with chaos, actually doesn't kind of doesn't like it 'cause things are calm. And everything's good. So what's gonna happen? They might create chaos when it's not needed. Uh…in treatment, what we know is that family if the family unit the system is very important. Especially, the immediate system, and then you have a support system out there. So just because a child goes off to a alternative placement or a residential placement does not necessarily mean that they're all just poof better. In fact, it's highly indicated that unless the family also understands treatment, and also understands the change that needs to be make… made. What, what will happen is the kid will return to old behaviors once they return home, in fact kids that go to residential placements. Unless their family is also involved in the treatment which could involve parent education classes, group therapy, family therapy, which is a big part of it. And understands their role in changing, 70% of young people that are discharged from residential placements will return to baseline behavior within six months. So that's almost, almost three-quarters of those kids will go back to their old behavior 'cause their parents aren't involved in the treatment. That's why this second sound odd to say, but it's good that insurance companies a lot of times are requiring parents to be involved in different treatment settings, or they won't pay for it 'cause the research is pretty clear. In substance treatment, it's very clear that when a person, the identified patient can go off to treatment. But if other people don't understand recovery that person gets sober. They can come back into that. They can drag that person right back into addiction. All right, so secondary gain which is really what that's about is important to understand. It doesn't mean you can always intervene, but I think, you make people aware of it that there is gonna be changed. Kids can change quickly. Its adults a lot of times that don't, don't have that have trouble with changing and don't have the, sometimes the energy or the ability to change so quickly. What is a new behavior that could achieve the same function? That's called a replacement behavior. That's the objective of the new plan. How is that new behavior gonna be taught? You can't just expect the kid to know how to behave. We got to teach them the way we want them to behave. Perhaps the adults need some skills or some training to do this. And, and we wanna, we wanna make sure we set them up to be successful. What is or was the reinforcement plan with, how does a new behavior gonna be reinforced? If you kind of, put your plan together and you realize wait a minute, we've got some safety issues. You can go back to the safety plan. Now I suggest starting with the safety plan. But sometimes there wasn't a safety issue to really, to really worry about. And we started with more of a behavior plan. And then we realized wait a minute, we do have an unsafe behavior. So I put the safety plan in there a second time just as a kind of reminder another template, hey, you can always loop back to it. All right. I'm gonna talk about safe rooms for a little bit, and then we're gonna take a break. Umm… safe rooms are rooms that are designated as a calm down area for kids instead of reached restraints. I'm, I'm not against restraint completely. There is a time and a place for everything. All right, but restraints are dangerous. They're dangerous for kids. They're dangerous for us as adults. And safe rooms are can be a great alternative. They can be a nice place for somebody to calm down. All right, umm… and they're called different things. Uh…quiet rooms although I rarely hear them be quiet. So I don't know what they should call them loud rooms, I guess. Umm… they're called timeout rooms. But timeout isn't always a, a, necessarily a bad thing. You could take your own timeout. And, and I think, sometimes, we use that as a kind of a punishment, a negative sense, so timeout has a kind of a bad ring to it for some people. Uh… alternative learning environments, although it's not really a place where you do teaching, so I don't know why that they would call them that. So I call them safe rooms because that's what I think they are. Their place to be safe. Umm… some situations are not suitable for safe room use. Uh…certain medical conditions we have to be careful. Uh…previous issues with neglect and abuse if a student is at risk of self-harm uh…students that need continued uh…support and direct assistance. So if they need an adult with them at all times just for mobility sake or using the restroom that, that type of thing in a room like that probably would be kind of cumbersome to have another adult in there, especially if a student is in a wheelchair, etcetera. The setup of the rooms are essential. Uh…you have to have a designated room. You can't have a filing room that debt that secondary purpose is the safe room. The whole purpose of the room is designed for this safe walls, safe flooring, safe ceiling, no glass Plexiglas. It doesn't this seem obvious, I mean, it seems, like, what Scott, you're telling me something that I know. But yet I go into school, after school, after school, after school, and I see these rooms. I… I looked up at one room, and there was water pipes going across the… the… the top. You know, I looked at, and the first thing I looked at. And I went "If I was a kid, I would be climbing on those things." And they say, "Oh, you could never get to 'em." All I had to do to take off my belt and whip it over the top, and I could climb up there. And you know, kids can figure out ways to do they climb things that, you know, umm…or that you've got the, maybe the molding around the floors coming off. And so what's that gonna be they're gonna pick that off? All right, umm…so we have to think like that no glass for obvious reasons uh…Plexiglas, you know, no safety glass that type of stuff. The door needs to be able to open fully, preferably opens out so that when you, you open the door, you pull it out. Because if it opens in, our kid is a sit in front of it, and then you can't open it because they're sitting in front of it so now they've got all their weight. Uh…if it pulls out, the only thing they could do would be to hold the, to hold the handle which is much harder to do. And you can get special uh… covers on door knobs that allow you to open it. But you can only get one hand in there to do it so they can't hold the door because when you need to get in, you need to get in, right? Umm…there should be procedures for entering the room. A system, a procedures for how do we exit the room. All right! Safety measures four am room use. Okay. So umm…and I'm give you some common trouble spots in a little bit to think about, but discussion points or things to think about with your team if you're working in a school that utilizes these how is the room set up, what are the behaviors or factors that will lead to using that room, how do we enter the room, what safety measures are in place, and how do we exit the room? Those things need to be answered before you every user room. All right, common trouble spots, the students behavior in the room is more escalated than what led them to get to the room big, big trouble. The student has behavior in the room such as the following. They hurt themselves so self-harm. Or they have an accident where they intentionally urinate or defecate in the room. Or they are physical, there's somebody in the room helping them and their physical with that person. They grab a hold of them or they start hitting them. So those are things you need to think about and have procedures in place. Umm… what I said did and suggest that you would do if you're gonna use those rooms is to have a safety plan posted by on the door or by the room so that if those things happen uh… here's what I do because again it's, it's, it's hard to remember what to do when you're in that crisis situation. So if there's an accident for instance, this is who I call. Uh…if the students start hurting, hurting themselves, this is what we're gonna do. Umm… I think, you need comfort items that are close by like, squishy balls, and nerfs, and things like that. They're not gonna hurt anything but kids are something to do in there. It can't just be alone. So umm…I, you know, my standard go-to is usually what I would want. If I'm in a crisis, I wanna water. So I can, you know, drink water and cool down. I wanna something to mess with. So I would hand the kid at a cup of water, and let them drink that. And if they throw it, they throw it but who cares its water. Umm… if they drink it, then perhaps, perhaps get him another glass of water, you know, a cup of water. And something like a ball, you always get those balls are squishy, you know, you get all sorts of cool stuff and let him have something to mess with or throw umm…and utilize as a calm down area. And then you have to document of course, how long they're in there. Some students go into these rooms voluntarily because they see it as a safe place to go. And they'll even sit and work in those rooms. That's called non-seclusion use. So I suggest having a separate way to document that because that's different than putting them there. And the reason I suggest having that is because down the line, let's say a parent sees that their child has been in the room 20 minutes a day for a 3 weeks. And then they, my child's been in the safe room every day for 20 minutes so you know, like, no, no, no. They went in there to work. Uh…well, that's always said so that's why I say, "I think, you need the non-seclusion documentation, and then safe room use documentation." Okay, so that those are separate. So there's no confusion about why they were in that room. All right, well, as we, we're gonna move forward umm…when you come back from break, we're gonna talk about reinforcement. So uh…safety plans are establishing and, and good systems are in place. Regarding behavior planning, we're gonna look at, why would somebody wanna follow the plan? Have we defined the behaviors and defined the purpose of the behavior? What's the incentive for behavior improvement? That's what we're gonna be thinking about next. So when we come back, uh…we're gonna talk about reinforcement. Why? Well, we all wanna be reinforced. The reality is whether it's socially, emotionally, spiritually, even uh…physically, financially later in life. We want to be reinforced. And we need to be reinforced that's what keeps us doing what we do. And there's different layers of reinforcement and, and natural mode natural motivation is wonderful. You're naturally motivated to do things or naturally reinforced by doing things. But they're, it's natural, right? But in as, in a, when working with kids and behavior management settings and school settings, what we're doing is we're developing reinforcement systems because you can't just wait around for somebody to naturally feel good about doing something or you, you'll be waiting a long time, right? 'Cause that's that also requires life and, an experiences. So that's what we're gonna talk about when we come back. All right, we'll get start it again. And where we left off, it's Eddie motivational incentives. This is natural is best so I wanna talk about motivational schemes. These, this is a system that I… I broke down different ways that were motivated into different uh… schemes. So it's easier to understand, and look at, and think about the kids that you have, and kind of how they're motivated and, and maybe why sometimes, maybe a reinforcement approach or a reinforcement program doesn't necessarily work. It's not that it's a bad idea. It just didn't fit for that person. And so first layer I wanna look at is internal versus external, intrinsic or internal motivation is the sense of satisfaction that you get the feeling of mastery, the sense of accomplishment "I did it." Okay. I feel good. I do things because I like getting them done. I like being complete. I like how I feel when I do it. And extrinsic or external is more I get something for it so token economy would be an extrinsic or external reinforcer. Oh, at my karate school, I have a treasure box. It's full of little toys. And some kids are all about the treasure box that's what motivates them to behave well, and come class, and, you know, all that kind of stuff. So either way is fine. You know, if you're internally motivated though, it's a little bit harder to measure and, and, and kind of get a hold of because it's in, inside the person. If they don't feel something from it, uh…they're probably not gonna be highly motivated to do it. Uh…and if they're on a highly external program, they might not buy into it. Umm… I know, I'm very internally motivated. So if I don't feel something from it, I don't invest a lot of my care into it like, I just don't care. It's just, it's not that I don't think it's important for somebody, I just don't care. I have to feel it. And that includes the accomplishments that I've had. I've got a lot of accomplishments or different things that I've done. And I'm sure you have too. And I don't necessarily need anybody to tell me the job. I don't need a certificate for it or an award. I just something that I did that I enjoyed doing, and that's done and not moved, I move forward. Social and emotional was the next tier. Social kind of fits on the scale of whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, weird what do you introverts need to socially feel good and then what do what do extroverts need? You know, and what happens when it doesn't match? What happens when introverts have to do extroverted things? And what happens when extroverts have to do introverted things? So for instance, if you say to an introverted kid, "Hey, if you do what you're supposed to be doing, you get to do what all the other kids are doing." But I don't wanna do what all the other kids are doing, right? So now you've told me what I will get if I'm good that I don't want so that's, that's what I mean is. Sometimes we're not matching motivation. Umm… and you can't always do it perfectly but you just definitely when a side-on towards the favor of, of which, which way the person goes no emotional. It's a little bit more complicated, I think. Umm… some people, you know, kids really need a lot of attention. They need a lot of love. They need a lot of affection. They want to follow people. They want to uh…have friends. And they want to take care of things. You know, there's, there's kids that wanna leaders. They wanna, they wanna lead. They want to be in charge. They want to, they feel good when they're in those positions. There's nothing wrong with either one of those. Umm… you know, if you have a 5th grader, and they're, they like to be a leader. They're like to be a helper so let them go help the kindergarten kids, for instance. It could be, there could be something that's highly motivating that they will work to get umm…because it's such a big deal for them. And it's pretty helpful to do that kind of stuff, and the kindergarteners like it because here's an older kid, you know, a big guy coming in to help them. Attention, you know, who do you want attention from would be probably the first thing, and how do you want to get that attention? The who part is pretty easy. It's the how the process of getting attention that is a little bit more tricky. Some people like lots of attention. Some people like more subtle attention. Uh…so it's not embarrassing. So it's not over, not too much. Generally, little kids kind of like, you know, kind of big attention. And as kids get older and become more sensitive to their social uh…relationships that, that sometimes adult attention is a little embarrassing or maybe puts them in an awkward position. So I want you to like me but don't like say that you like me because then that's, that's too much. So there's all these kind of hidden, hidden things that go on. So let me give you a fun example. Let's, let's say we're having your birthday party. Okay. And before the birthday party, I would ask you if you want us to sing happy birthday during the party, why would I do that? Well, it's a respect thing but also because I know that some people absolutely don't like that. How many of you don't like having happy birthday saying to you? Okay. How many of you love having happy birthday saying to you? Okay. Either way is okay and some, some of you mate, it's like I don't care either way. It's, it's fine. But imagine if you did not like it at all, it's like horrifying to you to have everybody sing to you, or go to one of those restaurants where they come and jump out at you and, and start singing to you. And I have taken the time to ask you about how you want things to be at your own birthday party. I'm filling your bucket. All right, obviously we're having your birthday party but I'm also showing you enough respect that we're not gonna sing at your birthday party. So we'll bring out the cake, and then we just skip the song, and we go right into the next. We're gonna go eat the cake. You're gonna like that. You're gonna value that. And you're gonna see me as somebody that's sensitive enough to what you want that I'm willing to do that. Okay. And vice-versa, if we wanna sing, we'll sing. All right, but it's those small things like that they can make the difference with kids with behavior issues. And they see you as I don't always have to do everything now you want to do. I… I… I get talking about control, right? They get, they get some say in that that's their birthday party, don't get, don't they get just to, to decide that one. Escape, escape, we know, is highly motivating to many people. So physical escape, you have to manage that a little bit better. So for physical escapes, uh…it might look like doing a special job having a, you know sending a kid on a mission so they're actually assigned to leave instead of just leaving on their own. Emotional escapes, I think, are more easy to manage. You know, you give people those breaks. You let them drift off for a while. You let them not pay attention. I've even done a, a really direct intervention on escape where I have told kids. Okay. I do not want you to pay attention to anything I'm doing or saying for the next minute, just absolutely ignore me. Well, by telling you to ignore me, you're actually paying attention. So it's a, it's a bit of a, it's like a challenge because and some of the real smart kids will go wait a minute. By ignoring you, I'm actually following your directions, right. But you still get to ignore me and just spaced off and just do it everyone, lonely I hurt anybody, go ahead and do it. All right, so it's this fun way of, of assigning escape. But you can do all sorts of things in a classroom that allow for escape just a simple break, you'll have somebody come up and help you umm…get with a partner break up, and the group's, turn the music on, whatever it is, it changes the environment, changes what you're doing, and allows for the brain to experience something different which is really what escape is. It's just the brain wanting to, to stop doing what you're doing and do something different. And while you can't necessarily escape from an academic task because that's probably required, you can definitely change everything around it which creates a different experience. Okay. If I get to fly a first class, I'm still flying. And the, and the, and the length of the flight is still the same. But my experience is different. I feel less agitated. I feel less stressed. So if I gotta fly in a middle seat and cramped, it seems like three hours is like two days 'cause I can't get out, I'm trap, right. So it's, a lot it's about perception. And it's about uh…decreasing the need also to escape. All right, if we're afraid of something, okay, this is the next level of voiding things that make us afraid, feels really good. We like to avoid things that we're afraid of. The downside of that is it doesn't help us get over the fear. So first is let people avoid things that they're afraid of. However if it's things that they, you know, like, going to the dentist, a lot of people don't wanna go to the dentist because they're afraid. But you do need to go to the dentist. You get, got to go to the doctor sometimes get your shots or whatever it is. So how do you help somebody not only feel better but actually do what they need to do well. Things like gradual exposure and desensitization are very, very effective, in fact, gradual exposures are one of the best behavioral treatments there is for anxiety and fear. So let me give you, let me give you an example of, of this. And, you know, I'll go back to the fear of spiders just to make it easy. All right. So let's say you have a fear of spiders. Well, you would like to avoid spiders, I know. But let's say we are in a hands-on science class, where you've got to touch spider. And you got to mess with them. All right, but I've got you freaking out and having panic attacks about these spiders. So I need to help you get over those. So first what I might start with is a book on spiders. So you can read about spiders and learn about them. And then we're gonna get a picture book. And I'm gonna have you touched the pictures. Okay. Now I might increase your anxiety a little bit but you still know you're safe. And then we might look at videos or YouTube just cool spiders. You know, you're like, "Oh, you're moving." I mean, but you're okay still right. What I'm doing is I'm increasing your resilience. I'm increasing your ability to tolerate the stimulus on a gradual basis. I'm not just throwing you in a room full of spiders. That's called flooding. That's what we do to somebody when we make them do something that they're terrified of doing. So we go from videos. And now we get rubber, the rubber play spiders those plastic ones. Uh…and so you play with the rubber spiders. And then we look at real spiders, like an aquarium so on and so forth, it'll get to the point where you could actually touch a real spider if they'll, you know, my pet spiders. But you could have like a tarantula and let it crawl on your arm. You know, and some you're like, "I don't think so." But you could do it. All right, it would it be your most desired activity in the, probably not. But you could get to that point. And you can do this with anything. You can do it with public speaking which is a common fear that most people have certainly a fear that many adolescents have is speaking in front of their peers which is why they avoided those type of activities or they act out to get kicked out so they don't have to do it. So if you're seeing that type of thing going on where a kid is acting out, figure out the triggers, a lot of times it's social stuff. I've known some of my students that will act out to get not in the lunchroom. They, they get kicked out of the lunchroom. So they go eat their lunch in the office it's perfectly fine. Why? Because lunch rooms noisy, first of all. Also there's a social, there's a lot of social things you got to figure out in something like that. Where am I gonna sit, who am I gonna sit with, what if they say no, what if there's not a chair, etcetera, etcetera. So, so, you know, kids that are extroverted and all that stuff love that kind of thing. Hey, umm…everybody come sit here, and this would be fun. And I'll scooch in even if there's not a spot, I'm gonna and but some somebody like me, I would avoid a lunchroom that is like, "I don't know anybody. I don't know anybody. Where's my friend? Where's my friend?" Forget this. Forget you. I'm out of here. I'm not gonna do it. And, and I get caught in the hallway. This guy, you need to be at lunch, I don't think so. And if you try to force me, I'm gonna really be not very happy with you. So let me go. You know, all he loves by myself, or 'cause I like food, or I'll go eat with a friend but I'm not going back into that prison that you call a cafeteria. And that seems for extroverts, they can't understand that there's like, why I don't understand that. But for introverted people, that would make a lot of sense. So figuring out what somebody's afraid of, help them overcome that one of the biggest favors you can do for them. Sensory, I think you start with common sense things. If you get a kid that's moving all over the place, they're going to need movement brakes. If they're fidgeting, they're going to need an appropriate fidget item. And you can do all sorts of great things without causing a lot of disruption. If you've got a kid that's constantly moving their legs, and they're kicking the table and so get one of those rubbers Thera bands, you know, they look like big rubber bands, you know. Let's tie it around the put it around the… the… the legs of the chair. And let them just go against that. It meets the sensory need. All right, those exercise balls, things like that. If you have kids getting up all the time 'cause they're thirsty, you know, have water a bottled water right at their table, just right their form so they don't have to get up and leave. You know, those types of things are very easy, umm…increase recess. You know, we have taken away recess so much in so many elementary settings that we end up with more behavioral issues. You know, increase recess, then that'd be a long recess. But increase the frequency of recess because you'll get more work production in between, and you know what it's something to look forward to so the recess itself can be a reinforcement and, and so you kind like push everybody you got your whole group motivated. Everybody, come on, we wanna work hard because we wanna be the first ones out for recess today. Or if we work hard when we get this done, we get extra minute of recess or something like that. And so now you're motivating a whole group to kind of push forward, and get, and get going. And the last one of these is control. So remember what I said earlier, it starts with feeling safe and secure. And then we start looking at appropriate choices. And, I know, I know, what the way I like to give people choices is a visual schedule. I really think visual schedules are underutilized uh…for kids that aren't readers use picture schedules, or uh…velcro, or object schedules, or you can actually physically move the item into the completed side. Uh…a visual schedule for a reader obviously you get things written out. And schedule is just always right there for you. It's very clear and what you need to do. It… you can do it like a menu where you're choosing which one you're gonna do first. So somebody like me, I would like that. If I had four things I had to do, that's fine. I'll do 'em but I'd like to choose which one I do. If you tell me which one to do, okay, maybe I'll do it, maybe I won't. But if I get to choose, then it's, there's at least I've got some say in it just feels better. People that are anxious, they're gonna be better on a visual schedule 'cause it helps keep them calm, and this is what I have to do, this is my schedule. People that are obsessive, like visual schedules because it's very clear. This is what we do. This is the time we do it. My Ducks are in a row. It feels good. All of you probably know kids that really are kind of rigid, and things need to go a certain way. And if things don't go that way, then I kind of fall apart and that's that cognitive, cognitive in flexibility. So uh…a visual schedule is very helpful for kids like that as well. Any questions on the motivation, umm…schemes. And I didn't ask I darn it. I should have asked if there was any questions from anything before our break. You may have anything that they were wondering about. Okay. So we really want to end negative behavior cycles in a solution-focused manner, this means focusing on solutions rather than problems. Accessing strengths and capitalize on what a person does well. We wanna set people up, set 'em up in a good way. Behavior planning should involve bringing out the positive behavior of a person, their assets, their attributes, their strengths, so we fit their motivation with the plan. A behavior plan should not highlight what they're doing that's wrong. Okay. So a behavior plan that looks like that would say something like, umm…you know, I saw this plan not too long ago. Let's say the kid has trouble keeping his, their hands to themselves. So they touch other kids. So there's, there's three boxes. Now when they, when they touch other kids, they get an X in the box, and three X's which was like three strikes, then you're out. Then you get a go to timeout area. Okay, that's focusing on the, the behavior that we don't want, okay, which is really negative, kind of negative reinforcement. All right, but what if we focused on capitalizing on every time junior keeps his hands, feet, body, and other objects to himself. Okay, should we be… should we be noticing that? Yeah! Yeah! We should, right? And so we're gonna give him a smiley face or whatever it is, every time he's around somebody else and he doesn't touch anybody else. Now we're gonna verbally praise him or we're gonna make a little tally or whatever we're gonna do, and we're gonna make sure. Yeah, he knows or she knows that that's the behavior that we wanna see, that's what we wanna recognize. Once that systems in place, then you could have your three-strike rule if you want it. But I wouldn't make it a three-strike rule because to an oppositional kid, you know what that means? It means, I get two free hits. It makes sense. I touched somebody, I get a warning. So what? I touch somebody again, I get a warning. If I do it a third time, I'll get penalized but what if I don't do the third time. Okay, and that's kind of how we think, well, I mean, let's admit it. If the speed limit says 60, I know, I can go 63, you know, I can do it probably that I'm gonna get caught. I just know I can't go 75 that's, that's, that's pushing it too much. So umm…you know, I think, you can cross the line, you kind of know how much you can cross but then there's a point where "Geez! I can't do it too much." So wiggle room within the plan is important to you. So how do you discover what is motivating to a person? I think the assessment for this should be as powerful as figuring out what is wrong. If anything is missing in my intake umm…in terms of formal assessment is that I don't do enough looking at strengths, assets, interests, and stuff like that. I'm doing better at it. But there aren't a lot of intakes written like that. We, we're used to clinicians. We're used to looking for psychopathology symptoms. You go to your doctor. And they want symptoms. All right, a nurse wants symptoms. A dentist wants what's, what's, what's wrong. People aren't usually asking, "What's going well?" Okay. But I think if we shift, it will start getting different results, so formal inventories are where you're actually going through paper, pencil, and assessing for motivation. Okay. So I've developed an assessment of motivation tool. All right, I use that. You can do it with your little kids. You do a list of favorites favorite food, favorite animal, favorite color, favorite number. I mean, you just start with really concrete things. With older kid, you start getting into interests, activities, or you can do tangibles things that you can touch and hold that are that you like intangibles things that you can't touch and hold but are still important to you. Uh…you can really get into values, uh…family, you know, what's important about family, your friends. We think about teenagers. Friends are so important. Umm… your social life could be a very motivating thing. Uh…kids are into Pokemon, Pokemon go, I mean the Star Wars, sports is a big thing, music, you know. So informal interviewing is, is really just talking and getting to know somebody. The longer you know somebody, the more you'll know what's motivating to them. If you don't know them very well, get to know the person that does know them. They'll tell you. How do you get to know somebody quicker, faster? Pairing activities very effective way, when you pair with somebody, you, you connect with them on something that they're interested in with them. So… so we've got a kid here. I don't know him very well. But I know he likes Legos. So we're gonna play Legos. All right, well, we're gonna look at a YouTube video of Legos, or a catalog on Lego products, or something to do with Legos. Why? Because that's what their thing is. All right, if you're in the Star Wars, and I can talk Star Wars with you, right? I can't do Pokemon. I don't know, I don't know much about Pokemon. You'd have to tell me about Pokemon. Star Wars, I can have a conversation with you all day. I'm gonna talk about characters, and the story, and all that stuff so for a little while you and I are gonna be, we're gonna be all about Star Wars. Now we put that away 'cause now we need to do some work. But then the next time I see you, we can have another discussion about Star Wars. See what I mean, so it can, it's always something that we now have a connection with and… and really that's called a rapport building. But pairing is when you're connecting on a very, very concrete level. All right, so everybody's got something you can pair about. And you can also use that as the clue, perhaps how to make visuals and your behavior plan. So let's say, "I'm connecting and pairing with a kid who loves Spiderman. He's a first grader. And Spiderman is his world. All right, so spider-man is gonna be on the behavior plan. All right. Spiderman says, "Keep your hands, feet, body, and other objects to yourself." Spiderman says, "Follow directions the first time whatever." Right? Spiderman says, "Before we eat, we wash our hands." Because it's the world of Spiderman, right? And then eventually it'll change to something else. But that's how you can tie in that with motivation. It's important to remember what was the initial goal, what were we really trying to accomplish? 'Cause when we get lost in the secondary or tertiary behaviors, we start going down this rabbit hole that's hard to come back from. And… and in kids with behavior issues and oppositional issues umm…are very good at diverting us through little subtle behaviors that take us away from the primary objective. So let me give you a metaphorical example about Johnny. Johnny took the cookies. We're gonna use my pitcher of water here as an imaginary cookie jar. Johnny has taken the cookies out of the cookie jar. And Johnny's Mom comes in knowing he took the cookies. But she asks him anyway, the question which sets up the secondary behavior. "Johnny, did you take the cookies out of cookie jar?" "No." What's Johnny say? No. So he lies. All right. And Johnny's Mom starting to get upset. She, she doesn't like being lied to. "Johnny, tell me the truth?" Now she's setting up the lie. She's also setting up a possible another behavior which could be blame or something like that. "Did you take those cookies now?" "I think my Sister took them." So now it's blame double, double lie, right? Now he's in trouble. So he's it sent to his room. Mom's upset. He's upset, and all that kind of stuff. But what was his initial behavior who's taking the cookies which never got addressed, because we got lost in the secondary or tertiary behavior. Oppositional defiant kids are masters at this, and sometimes have it figured out well ahead of the actual time. And… and one of the reasons one of the things that happens is we… we forget to use common sense when approaching things like this. If Mom knew, he took the cookies. Why did she ask him, f he took the cookies? It's pointless. There is no win for Johnny in there. How doesn't he possibly answer that yes, I took the cookie. He knows he's in trouble. So I'm gonna lie about it with maybe, you know, maybe it'll work, maybe it won't, right? Have you ever heard this one or use this one? 'Cause this is a common one. It kind of gets me going uh…is that a good choice? Are you making good choices right now? What is the kid supposed to say to that? I mean, so imagine you're doing that behavior right now, and I say to you, "Are you making good choices about your behavior?" What are you supposed to say? Yes, I'm making good choices because you know I'm gonna say no, that's not a good choice. Or are you supposed to say nope, not a good choice. Now well-behaved kid maybe what you're doing is you're cueing them to think about what they're doing. And they'll, and they'll kind of go, "Oh, no, I… I shouldn't do that." But we're not talking about the well-behaved kids that just listen to you and to your subtle subject, suggestion that maybe I ought to think about what you're doing. We're talking about kids with behavior issues so that sets up another layer of behavior. So be directing and… and if it's a bad choice to 'em, that is a bad choice too. Or if they, they're not supposed to do that, tell them, "Do not do that." Now it doesn't mean they're gonna necessarily listen but at least you're being direct with your communication. "Johnny, I know you took the cookies. You weren't supposed to. So now we're gonna a have, not have any cookies." I mean, what else do you gonna do make him give it back? I mean so and… and avoids the whole, he can deny it all he wants. But he was gonna do that anyway. But he's already got the consequence, and it's done. Better yet later on, we're gonna, we're gonna train Johnny. All right, if you wanna cookie, just ask. And we're gonna catch him being good. Johnny, you walked right by the cookie jar. And you didn't, and you didn't even touch it. Excellent! I appreciate it! So 'cause we don't do enough of that, do we? No, obviously this is a metaphorical example. But I think, you… you get where I'm going with it. So why was a negative behavior occurring in the first place? We're trying to address those functions as much as possible. I want to look at and show you some other proactive strategies that are very helpful in teaching kids, really some critical skills how to regulate and manage emotions. That is a critical skill. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to be happy. It's just not okay to be wild, the silly, and reckless, and aggressive, or suicidal. How to manage impulses, delay gratification, stop yourself from doing things, umm…how do… how do you think more flexibly called cognitive flexibility. How do you think in the gray zone instead of everything being black and white? And how do you think about yourself, meaning look inside yourself. How did you get to where you're at now? How do you make decisions? Why are you feeling the way you're feeling? And then that's called metacognition. These are all critical skills with kids with behavior issues. And what I did, I made skill sheets for each one, so the first one here is on managing and regulating emotions. And what you'll see is a definition of what it is typical behaviors that you'll see a little bit about diagnosis in case uh…you diagnose uh…it but the important part that I'm focusing on here is strategies that's the important part of this. Is these are strategies that are designed to enhance emotional regulation. And they're listed individually so that it's like a menu, you pick and choose off of here. And you develop some uh…that you can use, and then you can keep those, you know, and you can, you can, you can alter 'em or tweak 'em a little bit for another kid. And so umm…I like using three-point scales. I like using visual scale, uh…visual schedules and so uh…I'm gonna show you a couple examples of that here in a little bit. Umm… but you could pick and choose off this list. And this would help with emotional regulation then, and you have impulse control. So you're working with a kid that is impulsive. We can't just stop and tell them to stop doing it, that doesn't teach them anything. But you could definitely help them learn their triggers for being impulsive. You could help them learn how to stop from doing something, think before you react. Okay. You could help them with relaxation which is a, a key piece of being less impulsive, how to weight which is delayed gratification, how to wait for things that you really want. Okay? The next one is, this is cognitive flexibility. So I make the title very simple "be less black-and-white." Think in the gray zone, this is critical being able to see the other point of view, being able to, to look at wait a minute, it doesn't have to be all my way, it could be a compromise. Now you probably know adults that could use a little bit of flexibility. All right, so let's start when kids are young so that they learn to think in the gray zone. And you go, there's different strategies you can do with that. And then metacognition, thinking about yourself not in the umm…selfish sense, but it's really, wait a minute, how do I can fix my own mistakes, how do I problem-solve, proven yes if you effectively solve problems, what you're using is your cognitive skills. And metacognition is looking at from a bird's eye point of view how do you think? You feel a certain way cognitive behavioral therapy is a, is one style of therapy that does work for some people, but it doesn't work for other people. And so this is more of a broad scope and helping somebody and maybe map out. Wait a minute, how did you get to where you're at earlier while during the assessment piece where it had that uh…different, different sections of, you know, school is and… and my interests are, that's the, that's the beginning glimpse at that. All right, so I wanna give you time to kind of look through these I encourage you to circle ones that hey, maybe I'd wanna use this. This might be a good, good thing to, to use. And I also, this would be a good time to ask questions about any of them if you, if you do have questions. But let me umm…go over a couple of my favorites. All right, if I had time, if I had a whole other seminar, I do a list of all the strategies would go through every one of 'em. But that would take a long time. These are uh…three examples of different types of visual schedules called mini schedules. A mini schedule is just a schedule inside of an overall schedule. It's customized for the situation. So it's not simply listing what you need to do. It's breaking down what you need to do, and what happens when you do it? Okay, so up top, we have Shelley's math schedule because Shelley struggles in math. So she needs a visual schedule now. She can read, all these kids can read. So it, it's just written now, you, if, if not, then you'd have a picture schedule which should do the same thing. Now Shelley, the first thing that she needs to do is listen to the teacher. It's easy enough. They don't, then there's a worksheet to do. But I've taken the worksheet and divided that into two tasks. So it's more manageable for her. And what's the incentive for her? Because she likes earning points that's what's reinforcing to her, and so if you do this, then you'll get your 10 points, all right, which is a big deal to her. Now Larry struggles in PE. He doesn't really like playing with other kids. And he doesn't like the physical part of PE which makes PE, his most difficult time of day. We've already identified PE every day, we have behavior. So are we just gonna avoid PE, or we're gonna try to make it more manageable? What, what we've done is created a visual schedule, a mini schedule for Larry that's pretty cut and dry because that's how Larry thinks. All right, he needs to warm up with the class. And today it's going to be jump rope, thing number two practice dribbling the basketball. All right, now we're starting to get into harder things now. He's gonna practice passing ideally with other kids. But if not, then I'll do it with him. If I'm the PE teacher, then I'll… he can pass with me. At least we're practicing a skill, and then join the other students in the game. Now Larry, you don't have to be happy about it. You don't even have to touch the ball, just act like, you know, fake it till you make it. Just pretend you're playing. You know, now Larry's gonna be kind of grumpy and crabby about this whole thing. But Larry really likes helping Mrs. Wilson. And he likes fish. So Mrs. Wilson is gonna feed the fish which is a double big thing for Larry so that's why he'll hold on. Even though he's grumpy about it, he'll hold on, so he can get to help Mrs. Wilson feed the fish. The last one is uh…something I would do for a group. This is my basic karate class which is a beginner level class. The class has five things that I want them to do. Now the incentive for the class doing all five things, which is really pretty demanding that's what I want 'em to do is that the birthday kid gets to choose the game for the class. So we have a list of games. And if you have a birthday that month, you are the birthday kid so you get to choose the game. If we've only done four of the five things, that's still 80%. So I still think I should reinforce for that. But I will choose the game for the class. It's still reinforcing just not as high as what the birthday kid would choose. So it's okay to layer reinforcements have like a mini reinforcer, big reinforcer, huge reinforcer. You know, so it, that's more fun. You know, I mean, that's, it's, again it's kind of like, you go to a restaurant. And they, they, you know, if you get an appetizer, that's a little bit better. If you get a dessert, that's really awesome, right? So uh…it's kind of like the upgrade in terms of reinforcement. Now if we only do three of the things, I'm gonna… I'm gonna wonder what happened was it that I didn't teach it right which I could still reinforce if 'cause it's my fault or they were just goofing around and they just got the three things. Well, I'm probably not gonna reinforce that much. So I've told the kids, you know, it's kind of like, we're on the Titanic. You know, what I mean? And we're all gonna sail together and enjoy. Well, we're gonna sink. And I'm the captain. I still go down with the ship. I use that analogy once and… and I said, "You know, it's like, we're on the Titanic." And of course, the kid in the back who's got to blurt things out doesn't even raise his hand. I know I did that. He goes, "You know, this Titanic sank and everybody died." And I'm saying, "Umm… well, thank you." You're, you're missing the point but uh…thanks for your contribution. So in this case, I've got the whole group I'm responsible for so that's why I'm doing it that way. When you can motivate a whole group to do something, uh…that's going to lift everybody because kids do learn so two adults from our social surroundings and a well-behaved group generally, it's gonna pull people up whereas a poorly behaved group is going to draw people into that. And there's something called incidental learning which is basically copying what other people do. And one of the best ways to learn anything is to just copy other people. And if you wanna be a great musician, and copy musician, you're a great, great athlete, then copy what athletes do. And if you don't know how to act in a certain situation, look what other people are doing. All right, and uh… do what they're doing. If your group is doing good things, that's a powerful teacher right there. And… and Mr. Rogers taught the stuff years ago, right? Find the friendly people, find the nice people, look at people with a smile on their face, you know, go to them, they will help you. And look at your friends, look at your neighbors, and do what they're doing. And a rising tide floats all ships so a lot of ways to think about that. Uh…this is a, a blank template for what's called a three point scale. And it's totally blank obviously uh…the point of that is to, to give you the template, and then you could… you can fill it in as you, as you want. There's a rating on the side a one, two or three. And the one is I'm doing great. The two is okay, but struggling a little bit. And the three is I'm having some trouble. All right, what does that look like? Okay, in terms of behavior, what does it feel like in terms of emotion? So each one of those has a descriptor next to that is what do I do, and then what does the adult or adults do? So you've got three things going on here. You've got a language device. The kid can tell you how they're doing by telling you or pointing. I only have to do is point. So we've got a communication device that replaces behavior as the communication piece. You've got adult coping skills, and a, kids coping skills, all in one sheet. If they're at a three level, which means they could become unsafe, then you could put the safety plan on the back side. So you just flip it over and go right in the safety plan if you needed to. Okay, the one, two or three works better if you have a metaphor tied to it that the kid relates to. So you know, maybe it's a happy face plan angry face, maybe it's a Star Wars analogy. So you've got purple, green, and red. Purple, being the awesome color of one of the persons' lightsabers, and green is the color of the Jedi, and red is this Sith. So and if you're Star Wars fan, you know exactly what I'm talking about, maybe it's a sports thing, maybe it's a car thing. So you got a full gas tank and down to an empty gas tank. That way, there's more buy-in to it. And it, in it, it's personalized. And I would use this in triage where you're checking in with kids. I would use it in a resource setting when you get kids dropping into your room. Uh…I would use it in a therapeutic manner, you know, at the beginning, during, and before you discharge. Certainly I would use it to send kids somewhere I don't wanna send the kids somewhere in a transition when they're a three. They're highly agitated that there's a making sense that's kind of setting the kid up to be uh…not successful. So umm…the quick little activity, umm…I'm gonna spend a couple minutes on this, but I want you to take a look at those lists, and because that they are long. And I want you to uh… find some skills that maybe you can use for your kids that you're working with. And develop a couple of ways for how you might wanna utilize those skills in your environment. So I'm gonna give you a couple minutes to look at those. Also if you have questions, this would be a time to answer. I will uh…instead of coming to you individually, I will answer those out loud so everybody can hear it. But also umm…if you have a kid that you have somebody in common with, you can, you can talk about it for a little bit but take two minutes, and then I'll resume talking. And the next thing I'm gonna talk about actually is schools, and parents, and meeting with the parents and teams.

SCOTT WALLS Okay, I'm gonna move on. Any questions, sticking out need me to answer? Okay. So I want to cover this section here uh…about working with parents. This is a, there's a critical piece umm…when you have school issues, your school behavior issues, and parents are and the guardians. First thing parents in schools should be connected directly to each other, meaning uh…linear communication. We don't want to utilize the student as the communicator of information. Okay, so linear communication is point A to point B, back and forth. Triangulated communications when you go through another party which diverts the direct communication, it's not functional. And kids with behavior issues are, are not very good communicators of, of, of the message. And… and things get misunderstood very quickly. We should monitor school communications to parents about their children and teens. And let me explain what I mean by monitor. I don't mean as in surveillance. I… what I mean by that is be careful about what we're communicating. Are we only communicating about negative behaviors, about things that go wrong? Because if we are, we can't expect great results to come from that paradigm because what we do is we program somebody to associate us being school people with negative information. And when that negative information is about your child, you're gonna become defensive or uh…perhaps afraid, or angry, or whatever it is. You all probably have numbers that you see come up on your phone. And you dread answering or you won't even answer it because you know that on the other side is bad news. Or perhaps through email, you see the person who sent the email to you. And you go "Uh…now what?" You and you have become programmed to associate that person's information with something negative. All right, and your response can often, my response can often be a result of that. Instead let's shift that around. Let's put communication system in place that's regular but it's not always negative. So in other words if, if it's email communication, then every day we're gonna send an email to the parent. And it's gonna be about just stuff, right? Hey, great to see, great to see Larry today. Larry had a fantastic day. I hope everything's going well. Call me if you have any questions. Hey, just want to let you know that Larry forgot his gloves today at school, they're here. We'll keep them for him. Don't worry about it. Every day, we're just putting a little deposit in the bank. We're showing that we care. We're showing that we're taking time to communicate. All right, in business, I call that, we call that touching people. Are we touching people, are we communicating with them, are we… are we associate making their experience with us a pleasant experience. All right, or is it "Oh, you're here," that kind of thing. And so then when I need to make it withdrawal, when I need to say to the parent, things were not good today. They're more likely to accept that or if I have to call them, they don't associate me with bad news, what they associate with me with is just news in general, right? And so they'll answer the phone. First of all, some people just won't answer the phone, right? I mean, you know who that is. You know, you're getting the voicemail 'cause they're not taking your call. They're looking right at it. You're not gonna do it. But they are taking your call and they're go, "Oh, yeah, oh, okay." All right, but they take it from you. And you're a safe person. You're a reliable person because you'll have communicated in a balanced fashion. Our communication is so incredibly important what we say to people how we say it and that you know text is hard to do that, an email is hard to do that 'cause you don't get tone of voice so that's not my favorite. But it is efficient certainly email is you just say what you guys say, and then you're done with it. You don't have to worry about a conversation. Uh…so I prefer the, the vocal conversation. But I encourage their parents uh…uh…parents to do their best. All right, and I think, a lot of people are doing their best with what they know how to do. I encourage parents let school professionals do their job. Let school professionals take care of school. They know how to do that. At the same time, schools need to do better about keeping kids in school using out-of-school suspensions and expulsions much less often and only for the most serious of offenses. And I've been preaching this, and preaching this, and preaching this. And I think, it's starting to get somewhere because in some areas, I know, they're really looking at "Hey, we're not gonna use suspensions." I've seen kindergarteners suspended. So I mean, some areas are really saying, if you're gonna suspend a kid, we need documentation that there was a clear and present risk of harm to other people. Otherwise suspending a kid for five days, or 10 days, or whatever it is, what are we really saying, and what's different? Because a suspension should mean when the when the child returns, we've got a different plan because it didn't work before, right? Something blew up. And so this person could not be at school because it was so serious. So if they come back to the exact same situation, do we just magically hope they're gonna be better, or have we created new, a new plan? Certainly with expulsion, we're saying, you can't be here. And yes, some, some communities have alternative programs. All right, and some of the alternative programs are good, some of them are abysmal. And so if your alternative programs are abysmal, let's fix them. Let's support them, or don't use them. All right, umm… so what happens with kids with truancy, I'm gonna(ph) talk a little bit about that later is sometimes the truancy combines with the suspension. You know, I mean, a kid is truant, they finally get back to school, then they get suspended. So that feeds that whole wanting to escape from school thing. And the more somebody is away from school, the harder it is to get them back. And the more likely, it is that they're going to engage in acts of delinquent, delinquency, or criminal acts. Because what are they doing if they're not in school. It's usually not good. So if you're a community provider that communication between school and you as the community provider is vital. We want to also avoid triangulation. Of course, you need your releases of information. All right, but as a community provider, a lot of times we're not, we don't understand what happens in the school. In schools, I think, a lot of times expect community providers to have this kind of all-knowing answer like to be able to fix everything. And… and then of course, that's not the case. If a kid is on medication, I think, it's important for medication providers to clearly be communicating with schools and back and forth. Because you don't know what the medication is doing when that kid is not in front of you. And you need the schools information about this kid drowsy, this kid does not eating, they're breaking out in hives, they're… they're get dry mouth, or whatever it is. And a medical provider is not gonna know that without your information. And if a parent won't sign releases, and that's their right, and that's not really on here. I think, we need to build that relationship up and… and that's not something we just say and then drop. I think, you need to continue to knock on that door and say listen for the benefit of Susie, for the benefit, the best interest of the child. We all know the language. We're gonna we… we need to release. And I think, community providers need to be better about that as well. 'Cause as a community provider, you have more leeway in kind of pushing things a little bit. And I don't mean in a rude way. But if I want information from a school and the parents like, "Oh, I don't know about that," I can say, "You know what? Yeah! I need to do that in order to provide good treatment." All right, otherwise I don't know how much further we can go on with this. And usually I'll get my… I'll get my way with and that that might be with a probation officer too. You know, so 'cause they're involved, and they, they have, they have a big say, "And what's going on?" The adults need to be talking to each other is another way to put it. And we need to make sure that we're not giving conflicting messages, especially the parents. If it happens in school, it should be dealt with in school. And if it happens at home, the parents should deal with it at home. Don't contaminate one environment with something that happened in a different environment. The reason is it takes away the responsibility of dealing with things positive or negative from the party that is responsible for it. It also sets up parents to be the heavies. The parents end up being the bad guys, no matter what. This is critical for kids that are highly oppositional. And kids that experience trauma and have something called attachment disorder. When we set the parents up to be the heavies, we actually create so much pressure, and so much stress. And we remove the responsibility of actually putting in the consequences that need to be put in. Umm… personally, if it happens in my karate school, I deal with it, good or bad. The kid had a great behavior. I wanna reinforce them there and talk to them there. If they've had a horrible no-good rotten day, I deal with it there. I do not tell the parent. I… I tell the parent maybe what happened. But I don't expect the parent or tell the parent, "Oh, you should take away their video games tonight, or they shouldn't have TV, or YouTube, or whatever it is." I don't do that because I need to deal with it there that's where it has the most impact. All right, and this is hard, this is hard for people to wrap their heads around. But let me give it to you the other way. Let's say a parent comes to you at school or daycare and says, "My child had a horrible night last night. I would like you to give my child punishments for what happened last night." And what would most people say? "No. We're not… we're not gonna do that now that that happened last night. I… I… I… weren't there. But we do it the other way all the time, don't we?" Then we get mad 'cause a parent won't do anything. And then kind of throw up her hands and go well, parents are not doing anything. All right, let's deal with it right there. It's all the more reason to have a good relationship with kids where they feel a responsibility, where they have respect for the educator. Okay, I don't want kids just, just respect the administrator. But the only time they behave is when the boss is in their room. I want them to re, to respect the teacher that's in front of them, the, the teachers assistant, the paraeducator, the custodian, and need respect for all those people. And we remove some of that when we take away the responsibility of being accountable in the environment that you're in. Okay, what about meeting with people? Well, they talk about having a great student meeting. Now I've been to horrible meetings. And I'm sure you have too. If you've ever left a meeting and feel like you've been run over by a bus, that's a bad meeting. You've ever left a meeting and wish you could had the energy to walk in front of a bus, that's a bad meeting too. Meetings that involve arguing, and leaving things unresolved, and people feeling worse than when you started aren't real good for any of us. And so here's some guidelines for having a meeting. First of all, schedule a time limit for the meeting that's a boundary uh… 45 minutes, an hour at the most. Yeah, okay, it's easier to schedule that way too. Uh… it create a welcoming atmosphere. If the meeting was about you, would you feel welcome at the meeting? Some of these meetings look like, you're going to court. You've got client, or patient, student sitting here, got the parent, and all these important people sitting there, it's like, you're going to, you know, board hearing or something. I mean, it can be very intimidating. And… and you know, people have their titles and all this kind of stuff and, and… and that honestly, your titles don't matter to people. Uh… they don't matter to, certainly don't matter to kids. And they don't matter to a lot of parents. Nobody cares about your titles. Nobody cares about my titles. The only people that care are you and the, the, the boards that license you that matters, other than that doesn't matter. So we wanna be welcoming and establish one person in the meeting as the official note-taker that's the secretary of the meeting, that's the person who gets to write things down, that's the person who's going to be the official recorder of all written information. Everybody else in the meeting needs to be engaged in the conversation because this is what I see in a lot of meetings. One of two things, people have their computers out, and everybody's typing. Or they've got notebooks, or you know, tablets and everybody's writing. And I don't know what they're writing. Today everybody's writing. And what that says to me is as if I'm the speaker, whatever you're doing is more important than me in that moment. And these meetings are often pretty emotional. You got to think about parent coming, they're coming for their child. That's their interests. They don't care about you, and your rules, or what you need to do in terms of education because that's not their concern. They care about their child. And sometimes they don't say it in the best way, sometimes I get it, sometimes they're angry, sometimes they're defensive, sometimes they're aloof but their, their child is probably gonna be their interests. But it's also having everybody, you know, writing things down. It's an escape, isn't it? This is what happens. Somebody will say something in the meeting that maybe is they're angry, they're upset, and what's everybody start doing? Everybody's writing here, or, or worse everybody's, now the kid might have said three words. People, what are, what are you writing? I don't understand what but well, how can you be typing that much information, you know, close it, let the recorder record the stuff they'll give out. Okay, when I used to supervise interns, I'd have the intern to do it. They needed something to do. And I'd have them record. All right, think about breaking up your meeting into three parts starting with strengths, assets, areas of awesomeness, super things about Stephen, the things we love about Larry that's what we're gonna start with. Because those are the things that are gonna help us move this child forward what they're good at. Their strengths, right? How often do we start with that? Hardly ever, so what we start with is what's wrong, especially in a discipline meeting, right? What happened? Now the kids in the meeting, what's the message we're sending the parents in the meeting. Let's say you're 100% right. After a while the parents gonna start getting defensive, all you're doing is talking about how bad my kid is now well. What about the other kid? I mean, things start getting into defensive behavior, right? What about the other kids, what about, you know, somebody else started it. You didn't say anything so you start getting into arguments that you can't really win. And there's, and they're pointless anyway. But what if you started talking about all the nice things about a kid, you know, if you can't say something nice about somebody, it's probably more about us, and it is about them, right? But as the sender of the message I'm gonna feel different and as this receiver of the message the parents gonna feel different, certainly the kid is. Then you can go the second part of the meeting, areas to improve on behavioral concerns perhaps. Third part of the meeting planning, update the behavior plan, changes in the plan. There should be a resolution at the end of the meeting otherwise what was the point of the meeting. Structuring the meeting this way creates a better opportunity for discussion and planning. Pre-meeting is a meeting before the meeting. This is necessary for several reasons. If professionals are in disagreement or dissension on the team which is okay but don't do that in front of the client, or your unorganized. We don't know what the plans gonna be. We'll don't have that disorganized sense in front of the parent. It doesn't make us look very smart. So if I don't know what the plans gonna be or at least a good idea where we're gonna go with it, I don't wanna meet with my client or my, the parent. I don't wanna do that and put myself in that. Situation makes me look like a goof. All right, if they're strong emotions involved, a pre-meeting can help alleviate those emotions because maybe, maybe professionals are angry, maybe they're, they're hurt, maybe they're feeling, you know, like jeez this is, this is really frustrating. Well, it's helpful the bill bounce that off of ideas without the client the student there so you can get that stuff vented out. All right, any questions on, on, on meetings? Okay, common, there's a common uh… area to trip over. Let me talk about truancy, one of the behaviors that was listed uh… the first goal with kids that are truant is get them to school. That is the goal. That should be the only goal on their behavior plan. Get them there. Umm… students need to have something at school that draws them back if they've been gone for a long time what is motivating to them, uh… it may be the academics but often there's, is a social thing. It's an interest. And we wanna dramatically improve truancy. We should be doing these things uh… kind of in this order. Okay, attendance monitoring, kept situations early, don't wait to the kids been truant for 15 days to start acting. All right, health-related prevention strategies, oftentimes truancy starts as a result of an illness or some sort of health-related issue. So the kid has gone legitimately, but then it's, then they're behind. Then it's hard to come back. And sometimes being sick feels good that sounds horrible for me to say. But let's say you're at home, you're watching TV, and you're watching your YouTube videos, and you're playing on your phone, and feels pretty good, all right, you're in bed gets a sleep in, well, then you're better you're not contagious anymore or whatever it is, you don't have your allergies aren't acting up. And you're still used to that kind of easy thing. You know, I mean, it's like being on vacation and trying to go back to work. All right, air quality is a big deal, a lots of kids with asthma have ongoing issues so schools that are, that are clean and have updated their air quality are gonna see better results from that access to mental health services and screening, schools that have hired their own mental health people, I think, that is tremendous. But if not you can contract with community providers, every community has mental health people in it. Umm… and some people are looking for work. You know, they, they, they need work. And mental health people are trained and screening for mental health that's what they do so that can be a great egg junked for schools, enhance the school culture and the connection to the community in school is a big piece of your life as a young person and is the school connected to the community, is a community connected to the school, does the community see the school is something good? You know, I've seen grocery stores connected to schools where they'll donate food, food that's not bad, but this grocery store. Hey, we've got too, we've too many oranges, you know, they're either and gets thrown away, or somebody's gonna eat them. We'd rather somebody eat them. They'll donate it I'll give it to you for free. Clothing stores donating umm… clothes, and coats, and boots, and… and shoes for kids, umm… sports associations, you know, getting athletes to come to the school, music, music uh… you name it. Increased student engagement mentoring of students, it takes one mentor to make a difference. Establish a mentoring system whether inside the school, or for outsiders coming in where students especially at-risk students are paired with an adult. It's not a, it's not an administrator it's not somebody that's gonna bust them for being in trouble. It's as a supportive person. Legal intervention comes it, comes at the end. But sometimes you need legal intervention. And truancy laws do help improve on truancy, umm… school program placements, uh… we should consider our con, our placement of students. For instance, should we be placing students with autism with students with behavioral and conduct issues in the same classroom? Well, the quick and easy answer that is "No, we shouldn't be doing it." Are there times where maybe that works "Yeah, sure." But there's nothing really indicates that the, the curriculum is the same, or certainly the treatment is the same. All right, there's no research that indicates that. All right, but that a lot of times that's happening because the kids have behavior emotional issues will just lump them in the same group, Okay, and so we don't do that with really anything else any other curriculum area we divide people out, imagine, imagine if this was foreign language class, but y'all here taking Spanish. Let's say German. French, way back there. And… and Russian, and we'll put some Chinese up here. It's foreign language just throwing the same. It'll work. We wouldn't dream of doing that. That would be chaos. But with emotional issues, sometimes we… we just kind of just assume everybody has the same need. And if you're in that environment, you know what I'm talking about. You, you might have kids that need help, eating and feeding, and going to the restroom, and things like that, and some kids that need functional curriculum, and kids that need activities daily living, and, you know, some kids that are highly gifted that need challenged academically, and then you're how you're doing all this, sometimes by yourself. So I'm talking to the people in charge right now that if you blame it on funding, the answer to this because I've heard people do this. They buy, "Oh, we don't have enough money." If you're blaming it on funding, then let me look at your administrative fund. Let's trim some money out of that. Nobody's to give me up on that offer. Let's look at technology that millions of dollars we spend on technology. And technology is wonderful. But could we trim some of that out to hire some more people? I bet we could, we could hire some highly qualified people to teach kids with autism, to teach kids that have functional curriculum needs, to help kids with conduct issues be more successful in their environment, and do philanthropy things, and empathy building things you can do that. All right, administrators that resist these types of changes, then perhaps you should go to those rooms and help. Because I know, there's, MP administrators watching this today. And they're gonna be watching it later on DVD. And so I am bashing you a little bit, and picking on you a little bit because we need your help, bause the teacher assistant can't make this change, because the average teacher can't make it change, because you got your job to do. But administrators can do it because you're the ones that go after funding. And you're the ones that change procedures. And the people that are in charge of legislation and appropriation of dollars can certainly do something about it. So I think, those of us in the frontlines need to continue to speak about this because kids need us. They need us to provide these services who else is going to do it? There is nobody else to do it. It's us doing it. Speech language needs to be able to come in and do their services OT, PET's. School counselors need to do their things. School social workers need to do their thing. The school psychologists, maybe will do those things. And the educators need to be able to teach the curriculum that they're trained to teach. But if we're always putting out behavior fires, and we have kids that are highly academically capable but have severe conduct issues, and they're being antagonizing kids with their lower functioning, what is happening in our environment? You're constantly putting out the fire. Okay, I know, I'm preaching to the choir but sometimes you need to in my role, you need to get up on the soapbox a little bit and tell somebody listens to you. So and I… and I see myself as an advocate for students so that's why I do it. The basic do's and don'ts of truancy I started with the, the do's list. All right, build positive relationships, identify at-risk students early as possible, communicate with parents and guardians regarding truancy, create a month maintain a positive environment. Positive behavior reinforcement credit recovery procedures in place, this is essential for high school kids. If they're deficient and recover in, in credit, they're needs to be a path to how do they recover that because if they're in the hole, and there's no way to get out of it. Why should they ever come back to school? All right, the don'ts. Don't ignore at-risk students. Don't give failing grades for poor attendance. Grades are based on performance of a assignment or a test, not on attendance. If you fail somebody, because they're not there why again, why is it, what's the incentive of trying to get caught up and actually take the test? Don't ignore health issues because that's a major issue. Don't ignore safety issue, some kids do not feel safe at school. If they don't feel safe, they're not gonna go. I wouldn't. All right, so we need after-school monitoring people, adults outside as well as in the hallways, and not just letting kids, just kind of float around out there waiting for their ride, or whatever it is. Minimizing, if we minimize the importance of socialization and social connections, we're really missing it. That's why a lot of young people are in school 'cause they're friends. And that's huge. If we isolate students, it's very damaging to do. And a lot of kids, a lot of kids I worked with, they're in rooms by themselves, or maybe, you know, they're in the, the office, a lot, or whatever it is in there away from a lot of the social interactions that are very important for them. Just as human beings to be social with other people, let alone to connect them to the buildings, certainly we shouldn't give up. One of my, one of my most memorable, you know, cases I ever worked on this… this young man who's, who's, you know, well into his adulthood now. He umm… graduated, right before his 22nd birthday which is 22 is our cutoff for being in high school. By the time he had graduated, he had dropped out of school four times. He had been in the hospital 12 times. He was nominated and accepted to give the graduation speech. So I go to his graduation speech. And I'm giving you the long story because I started working with him in ninth grade. So imagine, you know, he's 14 by the time he's almost 22, now we're just… we're just now getting to graduation. It was a long road. All right, and he umm… is giving the graduation speech in front of 400 of his… of his somewhat peers because the average age in there is 17 or 17. So he starts off his graduation speech, and I worked on it with him. And he, he said, "I stand here before you as a 21 year old, near 22 year old uh… senior graduating with all of you, I have to tell you that and… and he told you, tells you the and the graduation speech the facts that I just told you." He goes, the reason I am standing here able to give the graduation speech is because people didn't give up on me. It's that simple. I dropped out four times, you know, thinking I knew better. Yeah, I was in the hospital. Some of that my fault, some of that other people's fault because I had a lot of issues but people like Scott Walls. He named me. People like, Scott walls and other people didn't give up. We're always there. And when I came back to school, it wasn't "Oh, you're here," it was "How can we help you?" And he goes, "I still had to do this stuff because it's not nobody made it easier for me. But I was able to do it. And they gave me hope." And I think that's important to remember the last ones don't give up. And the installation of hope is something that in any helping profession that the bare minimums what we're doing. We're instilling hope in someone that it will get better, even when they don't think it will. But if we give up and say, "Well, they dropped out. So I guess, they're gonna have a hard life." I'm not sure that's the, the best message to give. I think, we welcome them back with open arms and say, "Come back. And you come back, we're gonna help you stay here. And is everything gonna be all easy? No, but we're gonna help you through it because that's our job." And that's what we'll do so…

SCOTT WALLS Uh… we're also related to school is about bullying uh… kids that bother other kids, and uh… the same processes followed for these behaviors as with other behaviors. In other words, what is the function? We figure out why are they bullying, we can help them not do that. And… and the number one way to really just stop bullying in its tracks is to increase adult presence in kids lives. Kids act differently when adults aren't or in greater proximity to where they're at. So if the kids are alone, an adult walks in, their behavior changes. Maybe their conversation even changes. Kids are on the playground. And maybe there's some stuff going on, it shouldn't be going on, and the playground supervisors move close, and all the sudden kids decide to stop that and go on. We were having trouble in one of the high schools with hallway behavior. In fact, most of the incidents were occurring in the hallway, so administrator decided to have staff come out into the hallways during passing time. Greeting kids and, you know, keeping them moving, and administrators would be involved too. And all of sudden, the behavior incidents go down. Not because of punitive measures, simply because of adult presence. All right, and this includes on things like social media because a lot of bullying takes place on social media, now social bullying Facebook, and Snapchat, and all these things. Why because kids have kind of tricked us a little bit. You know, I have a right to privacy on the Internet. You know, I can do it a lot. And I'm afraid not. All right, so uh… I'm going to be involved in your internet life. Because I wouldn't let you hang out with a stranger. I'm not gonna let you, you know, hang out with strangers on the internet. But also if you wouldn't say it in real life, you shouldn't be saying, you know, on the, on the internet, or on text. Okay, and if it's see… if it's wrong in real life, it's probably wrong on, on the social media. And it's probably doubly wrong if there is such a thing on social media because other people see it. It's not just me harassing one person, it's me saying that and a thousand other people hearing about it. And maybe 800 of those people spreading that out. Okay, so I think, adult proximity also exists in that. And it's not just, it's not micromanaging it's being ever-present. And it's, you know, I've had parents say well, you know, they need to get on the internet. I'm fine, put the computer out in the living room. And just like you would anything else? Peek over their shoulder and that's it. And the kid can go I don't look who cares. So I'm going to be up in your business because that's, that's my job and that's the way it is, you know, they, they don't have to like everything. So that's one of the easiest ways to do it, But if we pair up kids wisely, we can give uh… kid, you know, kid, kids that are kind of bully like give them a better example of be with it. You know, you can pair… you can pair a bully up with a kid that's really confident. The bullying behavior doesn't work anymore. That kid's gonna be like, "What are you doing?" You know, so you can get some good interaction that way positive adult mentors, empathy training teach kids why do kids bully, tap into their experience, and then use that and go the reason you're doing what you're doing is because it was done to you. So let's undo this uh… help them make friends, social skills lessons, bullies are… are at a higher risk of having things like depression. They have lack of social skills often. So bullying becomes a way to actually communicate and get along with others and feel good. So we should engage parents about their kids if their kids are being bully, uh… you, we don't want to threaten but we certainly want to explain what happens if we don't intervene, I think, it's important for clinicians to help uh… parents set good boundaries, set a good example, but get up in their kids business when their kid is doing something wrong, and don't be afraid to go 100% mom, or 100% dad, or 100% grandma on your kid. That's sometimes the absolute best thing that you can do. And if your mom, or dad, or a grandma, or anybody that has worked with kids, or even teacher, sometimes you just need to go 100%. You know, I mean, all of you needs to come out because that's what gets that kid to go holy crap, you know. Umm… and I've, and I've done that. I have unleashed parents on their kids. And… and it's always turned out to be good because sometimes we're coached. And we say these things that there's not natural. And those of you there are, that are teachers, you have a teacher look, right? No, teacher look is it's that look that says, "Stop, don't do that again. Or you'll die." Now you don't over, you don't over do that. But that kid looks at you and goes and stops whatever they're doing. Because this is teacher look, they understand it. And there's the mom look, there's the grandma look, and there's the dad look, and there's, there's the coach look, I know, I have a look. And I can look at a kid. And they see me look at him like that. They know they're in trouble. I don't wan to use it. I don't like to use it. But it's a look. And we need to teach parents to, to, to be able to do that and not feel bad about it. That's a good thing. Okay, that's a good thing. And we need to teach kids that, you know, we don't want you to feel ashamed of who you are. But if you feel bad about what you've done, if you do something bad to somebody, you should feel horrible about it. And I'm gonna make you feel horrible about it. You know, why? Because that's gonna teach you to not want to feel that way again. We are so worried that people are gonna feel bad about themselves, and that they're gonna experience a negative emotion. That when they do something wrong, we actually protect them. But it's that very emotion that keeps us from doing those things. Like, I don't like hurting people. I don't even like running over an animal, or squirrel, or something. I feel terrible when I do that and because I don't like hurting people. And it's okay that I feel bad about that. All right, that's my conscience telling me, "Hey, (inaudible ) a bad thing to do even if it was an accident, right? And kids need to feel that. That's your internal regulation system that works. Okay, so if people get upset with me when I say this, I'm not saying "We just shame kids. And everything they do(ph) a nation." But when you hurt someone else or when you don't protect somebody else when, you know, when you see something wrong, and you don't tell somebody. You're just as bad as they are, but the person doing it. Uh… one of my kids that I work with was in a, in high school, and he had heard about an assault. And he told me about it. And of course, I reported it. And the kid who did it got in trouble. And I… I went back to my kid, I said, "You know, nobody will know that you ever told me because it's confidential." I said, "You're a hero." And this is the kid identified with the behavior disorder by the way. That's sticking up for the kid they got hurt and doing it in the way that was confidential which was, which is very much respected. But I said, "You're a hero." I said the only person who knows that will be me or anybody that you tell. And I'd love to tell your mom what you did but I won't but good for you. You should feel good about that because you may have changed that kid's life 'cause you stood up for the right thing to do. So it goes the other way around as well. I hope you had a good lunch what where we stopped was the bullying, and annoying others part. And then the next slide here is about rages, tantrum, aggression, panic, crisis moments. And I know, umm… there's some, some need to return to some of the other stuff that I've talked about. But let me, let me go through this section because this is a, this is a big deal learning about what to do with kids that are in rage and aggression moments. And if you can manage this, you can manage about anything. And… and I want you to think about kids that you have and what does their crisis look like. So crisis can look like, a panic. It can look like, rage. It can look like, aggression. A meltdown however you want to consider it. So the three Ds of rage umm… dealing with anger, rage in the moment is helpful for nearly every area of oppositional defiant behavior. So umm… any, including kids with Asperger's that have meltdowns including kids with anxiety that have panic attacks, and kids with behavior disorders that have aggressive moments. So defuse, distract, and deescalate are the three Ds of rage. And I… and I utilize that so it's easy to remember. Okay, so the cycle of escalation and de-escalation looks like this more or less, you have a base calm stage, this is where you start. You get triggered. There's an escalating conflict. There's crisis. There's de-escalation settlement. And then recovery which is back to base calm but also possibly exhausted. When somebody's at base calm, this is when they're at their cognitive best in other words they are not emotional, they are in their learning state. This is where we wanna teach new skills right there. This is certainly where a lot of conversations can take place as well because a person's not upset about anything. The higher somebody goes into the crisis, the more irrational they become the more the fear part, the excited part of the brain hijacks the cognitive part. So really the less talking we should do, the more somebody is escalated. And as somebody physically calms down, they become more rational again, and then eventually back to their base calm state. A cycle of escalation generally looks like this but how it looks a lot is somebody escalates into a crisis, they start to calm down. We start talking too much, and then they go back up again. So you end up with this roller coasting looking cycle as opposed to just going up and down which is not very good for us emotionally and… and certainly physically. Remember our safety plan that we went over earlier, that would be activated right in here in this zone to manage the safe, unsafe situation. And I'll be talking more about crisis situations because that's one of the most critical areas that I get asked about is what to do there. So let me talk about the first stage which is defuse a situation. If somebody is triggered, and we know what the trigger is. Which hopefully through observation and interview, we are, we have learned that. The best thing to do is just remove the trigger. Okay, that's the best thing. Or remove the person from the trigger, that's the best. But if we can't do that, then we wanna defuse the situation. We change the environment so do something like change the setting, turn the lights off, turn some music on, uh… do a room scramble where somebody sits in a different spot. Uh… anything that changes the environment then we have to react to, to adjust to that. It's very simple. So if something is bothering me like a noise, and you turn on music, well, now I have the music that is now the stimulus. And so I forget about the thing that was irritating me. Change the players that's the people involved. That can be simply moving from here to there. So this person that was bothering me no longer is bothering me. It might be uh… if I'm bothering you, maybe I tagged out and somebody else comes in and now. No, you're not asking, you're not triggered anymore because the, the person that was bothering you if that was me is gone. Change the task. That could be completely different from what you're doing, or it could you be simply how you're doing the task. So let's say that the student is escalated or getting escalated about doing a writing assignment. Okay, then I… I… I need them to work on writing. So I don't take away the writing but I have them let's say working on a writing assignment or using a whiteboard. So they're, they're writing with markers and things like that. So now it's the same writing, it's just a different experience of writing. I saw them getting triggered by writing really hard and starting to get frustrated or tapping, you know, baking the pencil or whatever. Now I've got them writing with markers. And it's slick and smells good, and all that stuff. And they're still writing. Calming physical activities, while engaging in an activity, can be enough of a soothing thing that you can keep engaging in the activity. You don't have to stop it all together. So at this point, we're not in our crisis state. We're just, we're just triggered. Sometimes we need to wait it out too. We, we get too involved, too fast. And sometimes people just need time to figure out on their own what to do. And then they're fine. But if we push them too fast, too hard trying to tell them all you got to do this or hurry up, we can rush people and that causes escalation. Well, if that works great. We come down on the way back to base calm. But if it doesn't, then we escalate. All right, so that's a second D is distraction. This is offering options within limits. This is basically trying to get the person off track to avoid the crisis. What we're doing here is changing the topic. If it's a conversation, we're totally changing the topic. So let's say they're upset about whatever it was. Now we are talking about something else. If it's an activity, then we are distracting by doing something else. "Johnny, let's go for a walk." I'm telling Johnny what we need to do to get out of the situation and giving a physical activity to get out of that. Now if Johnny is a little bit older, I could give him another option. "Johnny, I can leave you alone. Or we can go for a walk." But I'm gonna limit my questions to only absolutely necessary things. I don't ask, I don't like asking kids with behavior issues lots of questions anyway. But certainly in these cases, I wanna make statements because statements are more clear. And if it's not a question, don't phrase it as a question. So I really want Johnny to go for a walk. I wanna him to get out of here because I know what happens to be stays. So I don't say, "Johnny, do you want to go for a walk?" Which requires an answer. All right, now Johnny, if he's stubborn and resistant, probably won't answer. So now I'm upset where he's upset because there's a question-and-answer paradigm or dynamic that has been set up. Okay, so Johnny, do you want to go for a walk? No. It's Johnny, let's go for a walk. Or Johnny, please come with me. And you can say it in different ways. And certainly you can be polite, and nice about it, and calming about it. You might even use a really soft voice. Johnny, let's go for a walk. All right, so I'm presenting. So I'm using my presenter voice. But certainly I wouldn't talk to a kid like that 'cause that would be too loud and… and kind of ridiculous to have that loud voice. All right, so a distraction could be an activity that they do by themselves. It could be uh… like I said umm… a change of topic. It could be an academic activity that is a total distraction. Umm… so if we distracted them and they forget about what, what it is that they were upset about great, they will start to calm down but let's say they don't. Now they continue to go up. And now they're in a crisis. Okay, they have gone into where we would be activating a safety plan. In general, in a crisis, we need to talk less, not more. And if you do need to talk be direct and use the person's name, be succinctly what you have to say, Joe, put down the scissors. So Joe is holding scissors. You know, he's… he's getting escalated. Now I need Joe to put down the scissors. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna say his name. I'm gonna hear his name. And I'm gonna say no more, and no less then what I need to say that I'm gonna be quiet. What happens in a crisis a lot of people like I said before start talking louder and faster, so they have very pressured speech. Okay, and that indicates that the adult is in a crisis. They're starting to escalate as well. And not only do we communicate that through our voice, we can communicate it through our body language. So our body language either escalates somebody or de-escalates somebody just as our proximity to that person can be escalating or de-escalating. So for instance, if the kid knows me really well, and I know them well. I might get closer to them because sitting down next to them might be very soothing. But if yeah, we're not quite, that close I might back away from them to be in a non-threatening position. Okay, now I can't demonstrate it here. But for little kids, I would probably sit down on the floor. My body position would be important in that case. For, for an older kid, I might sit in a chair but I'm gonna be very relaxed. You know, if I'm standing, I might stand in a very relaxed position like this certainly not in a threatening or defensive position. You know, if I'm standing there, you know, and my commander pose or my superhero, judgmental pose. I'm communicating something quite different than if I'm standing like this. Now you notice where my hands are? My hands are in the front. They are open. I know, I don't have anything in my hands. But I'm in a relaxed position. I'm communicating relaxed. But my hands are also ready just in case. Maybe they throw something, or maybe they come after me or whatever it is. Typically kids will come after you if you're close enough if you're threatening them, I mean, that's usually where the physical contact starts it's rare that they just come charging at you out of nowhere. Okay, so there's a thing to think about in a general, and a general crisis situation body language, or tone of voice, talk less, don't put people in a corner physically or emotionally keep in mind what would you want somebody to do if you were in that situation, if you were in that crisis, what would you want? All right, and presenting them, presenting somebody with a work test that's particularly difficult is not necessarily uh… the best choice but that work task was probably part of their trigger. We definitely don't want to present them as harder to do things. Now physical aggression, we have to ask ourselves, "What is this behavior telling me?" Is this behavior? Telling me that they are in pain, are they, are they trying to get attention, are they trying to communicate something, a lot of times physical aggression is not true. They're not trying to hurt someone. They are trying to tell you something or they're frustrated. And you happen to be that person that gets that. So are they telling you to back away to get away from them? Are they saying I need you to hold me to help me? They might be saying that keep in mind yourself, of course, everyone else that you're responsible for is safety is always first. Much like being a lifeguard, you just don't jump in the water. And you know, without some sort of plan, or life-saving device, or the person will pull you under as well. So in this case, we have to, I have to be safe before I can help somebody else be safe. And if I don't feel safe, I'm gonna go into my fear, my survival response. So remind the person about things that they could do besides hitting you. Perhaps you can leave. Or you can go to your safe place. Or whatever it, whatever you call it or, you know, I can leave I can always back away if it's getting kind of dangerous. I like to keep myself between the person and my exit. That way if I need to step out, I can do so but if I'm trapped, and they are between me and my exit. Well, I can't get out. So it's gonna put me in a more defensive position. If you do the same thing, you get the same results. So it's important to if things are happening physically, we need to do something different. A lot of behavior of incidents that I see that have to do with physical, especially physical restraint involve patterns of behavior which means we're continuing to use physical restraint, or we'll continue to use some sort of intervention with absolutely no change. It's time to do something different that's where it's time to go backwards and go all right. Their behavior is here. We keep doing this. And nothing's changing. I need to do something different. Because when I do something different, it causes the reaction that happens after that. What I'm doing in this case is they are acting, I'm reacting. So I'm constantly in catch-up mode. But we need to stop that whole cycle and get into the actor mode. Know your limits, it's important to know your limits and… and physically, your limits but also procedurally uh… utilize best practice in terms of when to be physically involved or not. A basic guideline, this is what I live by you can follow it if you want. But if I'm gonna be physically involved with a kid, in other words restrain them. The reason I would do that is to not do so would cause a greater safety heart, a greater safety risk. So for instance, they're gonna run out into the street. Well, I'm gonna stop them. Or I'm gonna try my best to make sure they don't do that. Okay, now the flip side is if I am physically involved in a greater risk is present due to physical involvement that means I should be backing away. Okay, request assistance asks for help get other people in there that should be part of the safety plan to keep your hands in a safe manner like I talked about. And then you can deflect any kind of strikes or objects coming your way. There is a concept in restraint called the stimulus transfer point. And this is something I learned from Mandt training, Mandt is a system of de-escalation. Uh… and they have a great, they have a great system. And the stimulus transfer point is when uh… someone is being restrained, and then they start to analyze the restraint to get out of it. All right, to analyze something means, you have cognitive skills which means you're not out of control. You are actually in control. And at that point when you realize that you need to start backing out of the restraint, and it takes about three to five seconds for this to happen. So it's a very quick process. The old or antiquated ways of restraining kids used to involve well when their body relaxed, or when they slowed down their breathing, and all that stuff. That's called exhaustion. And that's dangerous. Okay, so I think, if we're in patterns of physical issues with kids, we need to make a list of all the things that could increase the risk of restraint associated injuries or traumatic impact. And then we need to make a list of things that will mitigate the risks. All right, so that protects the kids, protects you, and it protects other people that are gonna be helping. What if it's verbal abuse in the midst of this crisis? Well, well, why is this happening? What, why are they giving me all the stuff that they're giving me verbally? And some of this stuff is just hard to ignore, and maybe shouldn't be ignored because they are communicating and so. At this point, we might not be in a dangerous crisis. But we're, we're kind of hovering. And it's like a sub crisis. We're kind of hovering underneath it. And they're using lots of words which is good in a way that's better than behavior, right? So we probably encourage this somewhat tell me what's going on, don't show me what's going on, tell me you're upset, don't show me by throwing chairs. All right, so in a way this is good, but also verbal abuse is bothersome for many people. And so the time we need to be most concerned about verbal abuse is when it involves a threat, a credible threat. I am going to stab you. And they're holding the scissors in the air is a credible threat. Obviously we would back away. I'm gonna shoot you with my grenade launcher is not really a credible threat. So okay, I don't know, I don't know, I'm just gonna take that that you're angry. I'm not really gonna give that much uh… credibility. Do I want to attend to this behavior? In other words, do I want to really engage in this conversation? Can I ignore it? Well, they usually typically yeah, we can ignore that the swear words, and the things that they call us, and all that. Could I ask for different language? If the respect and the relationship is there, yeah, you can. You can look at a kid and say, "I hear what you're saying." We're gonna say this a different way. We don't use those words here. Or, or in some similar fashion, you're gonna cue them no. We don't speak like that here. Okay, you're gonna remind them. I can tell you're upset, I'll leave you alone for a bit that's going back to offering an option. I can tell you're upset, let's go for a walk. You're reflecting upon their emotion. What I hear you saying is that's paraphrase. Okay, and of course, if they do rephrase it and say it better, then we want to reinforce them, right? I can tell you're upset. And you said it in a good way. I appreciate that. That is hard to do. That's hard to do when you're a grown person, right? So if you're a kid, a kid, you do that that's pretty good skill. We're still in the crisis phase here. Utilize your environment, you have desks, and chairs, and tables. You can use those as barriers as protective barriers. You can create distance when possible. Uh… if you've got a biter, or such scratch, or somebody like that that you have to be close to because if you can't work you do, uh… you can use uh… put on a coat, put on a sweater, long-sleeve shirt natural barriers against those kind of things so they can't get right to your skin. Umm… and like I said keep yourself between the student and the exit, I think, is very, very important. If you have a classroom and you have a kid that's a runner, you need to not place them by the door. Okay, they need to be away from the door because that is the easiest exit out, best is a corner, you know, walls that come together where you can make like an office area. Okay, and on the walls are their posters, and their visuals, and all that kind of stuff, and they can be facing out but there's two exits that are covered because there's walls there. And then you, you can, you only have to cover one or two exits as opposed to four different directions. But if they're right in the center, they can go everywhere that you want. All right, environmental reaction plans are different things you can do within your environment to, to react to crisis situations. Well, the preferred one is a student that voluntarily leaves the area and goes to there calm down place. And that can be cued by them or you. And you can use a brake card to do that where it's just a card you show 'em, flash it in the air where they need to go or they can use it. A visual schedule, well also cue them what to do, it not terms of it, not in terms of their academic work, but this is what to do when which is like a three point scale, you know, okay, when you're, when you're agitated do this, and when you're feeling unsafe do this, some type of uh… hand signal time-out, break, stop, something like that can subtly cue. This is what needs to happen and out of classroom conversation. If talking has been traditionally useful for somebody, taking them away from their audience creates privacy obviously but also helps you save face it. It makes you so you're not embarrassed and takes away the audience that often is kind of encouraging this kind of stuff by laughing, or giggling, and… and those types of things. So quickly pull out and say hey, let's talk. Say what you gotta say that can, that can balance it out now. If they don't calm down by talking that's not gonna be a good measure, send the kids on a mission, send them uh… to a designated area so they have another way of escaping. Reaction plans during a crisis, the uh… first method would be to clear the crisis area. This is necessary to ensure that others are safe. So obviously here you have a group of kids. And… and you've got one that's being unsafe, what, how do you manage the other 24 kids? Well, they need to leave. All right, and you would work that out ahead of time. You'd have a code that you would call or just say leave. And our code exit, or whatever you wanna say, or you ring the little bell, and when you're ringing the bell, everybody gets up and goes. And they go to a designated area. Now you have one person that you're concerned about instead of 25. You also clear the audience. It's important to do that with, with especially with teenagers having an audience can be very… very powerful. All right, and it creates this whole thing of I'm not backing down because I will look weak in front of everybody else. So I'm gonna take you on. And some people have decided to do that. And it's turned out really bad. o if you take away the audience, or wait until the audience isn't there you'll have a much better chance of doing this. And I know, this is a disruption to the educational environment. I'm aware of that but so is the disruption. And it goes back to you. All right, is this ideal? Of course not, but what is the safest alternative? In a crisis, you have to go back to that. And I know, I repeat that but that it's so often uh… missed and… and forgotten. Here's a comparison. Let's say you have a, a kid, 25 kids in a room, and one of them gets sick and vomits all, all over the place, well, what are we gonna do? Well, everybody out, I hope that's what you're gonna do. So we can clean up and contain. And then they can return at a, at a later time. So we wouldn't think of everybody stay because we don't wanna, we don't wanna mess up the educational environment. It's already messed up. We're in a crisis state so this is our best option. And you try to make that easy efficient as possible. Next would be escorting from an area. So you are removing that person. And I gotta tell you, this is hard to do. So some questions that you have to answer about that are is it safe, when will we do this, at what point, where will the kid go, and so what will get him out in the hallway now, what are we gonna do, is the quiet area even close by, is it, is it the safe room close by, or is it clear down the hall down the steps and, and, you know, how far are we gonna be able to move this person, and how are the, how are they, how was, how are they gonna be removed. Okay? Who's gonna do this? Umm… what's the plan during removal? And… and then what's the plan for a return? You know, probably pretty easy to get a little kid out of a room. You've kind of, kind of move them along. What happens when they're a big kid? When they weigh as much or more than you, and they're strong, and they're wiry, and… and their joints move all sorts of different ways, then what do we do? Well, then you need a team of people. How many? Four, five people to do it safely, well, that look that doesn't look real good, does it? It looks kind of ugly. And it gets ugly. When you put your hands on somebody that's escalated, somebody's getting whack, the shoes gonna fly off, somebody's foots gonna get stepped on, fingers are gonna get bent back, so to do that safely, you have to have a team of people that work well together that can do it and that's a tall order. So that is a hard thing to do there's, there's push in some states including my, my home state about training educators to be able to restrain and remove kids from classrooms that are disruptive. And maybe there's some good reasons to do that and… and maybe not. But who's gonna do the training? Who's gonna pay for it? You know, there's a lot of questions that are unanswered by that. We already, we talked a little bit today about funding, sometimes we're short of people that we need in behavioral programs. And now we're saying in some areas, we're gonna let people do this. Well, who's gonna do it? Think about your buildings, who would do this? You know, you're gonna, you gotta have people that are strong, people that are able to do it, and they're gonna be there all the time because this stuff happens not in the most ideal times, it's when like I'm gone, you're gone, the team that's supposed to do it is not there. So who's the backup person? So is it an option sure? You've got a lot of bases to cover that's gonna be your option. Alternative plan, this is a, a plan B for the original plan on the safety plans. Remember the safety plan. This is what we wanna do. And what I just alluded to was what happens if Scott Walls is on a safety plan, and Scott Walls is gone. What's my plan B? Who is my backup person that could also do that same thing? Uh… and kids this is very helpful for kids because what if today you're, you're all here, so you have a substitute of some sort. Does that substitute know what to do? Does the kid know who to go to when you're gone? You're their person. All right, so who do they, who they talk to? All right, so a crisis that's all under the crisis part. Let's go to the third D which is de-escalation. We are de-escalating from an escalated state. And this is to help the person by doing something physical motor or sensory to get them to move to a place of being physically calm. Stress has escalated the person. Physical de-escalation helps the person come to a state of balance. In a crisis state, your body reacts what I said that one of the first things I said this morning. So your body has to get calmed down. Now this might be exercise, this might be a, a wreck motor activity, could be a sensory activity. It could be moving things, lifting things, shredding things, pulling on things, rolling on the floor, or jumping on a trampoline, sitting on an exercise ball, running around the gym, we all calm down and deescalate in different ways. When the body comes to a state of calm, then we can go into rest and recovery. All right, this is not the time that we're talking about consequences. This is not the time to, to process unless they start talking which they might be a listener, listen what they say. But if I say, "Okay, now you're gonna have to whatever the consequence is it's probably just send them right back into the crisis because it's like boiling water. They're not really cooled off yet, just that we can't see the bubbles. Okay, sometimes the consequence and the de-escalation go together. So let's say I made a big mess, but I cleaned it all up. And I put it away. And now I'm calm down. Okay, I think, we're done. Let's move forward. Let's not go back to that and talk about it. And… and you know, process it, and do all these things when we really don't need to. You know, you spilled the milk, you clean it up. All right, we're done. Move on. It's very important to deal do that? And I think, that's one of the things that we get stuck on is insisting that everything needs to be talked about, everything has to have an answer. If you're in a crisis state, you don't remember a lot of what happened. You might not even know that you called your very favorite person a really bad name. And that somebody says, you know, you've said called her such-and-such. They might not know that. So you're arguing about what you said yeah, you did say it. No, you didn't. I've had people say, well, it's good to videotape kids so they can see themselves acting out. Umm… maybe once in a while but, but the problem with that is first you get need to have permission. Umm… if you videotape somebody's kid without their permission, they probably get yelled out at a minimum, but also that the kid might see themselves on a video and still not remember it because your, your cognitive senses are hijacked when you're in a crisis. All right, so talking may help sometimes we just need to move, move forward. As somebody goes into rest and recovery, we need to do repair work. They need to get re-hydrated. Their blood sugar is gonna be probably zero. I mean, and… and so they need to get re-nourish, ou know, carbohydrate, protein. I suggest to be a mandatory that if you're doing restraint or seclusion that there's a medical follow-up afterwards by a nurse or uh… somebody qualified to do so to look at blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, uh… re-hydrate. If they're on medication, you got to look at that if are on asthma, make sure they're, they're, they've got access to their inhaler. If they have a uh… fragile medical condition, you look at that also you got checked for cuts, bruises, abrasions. This stuff happens in a crisis. And sometimes you don't even feel it because in the crisis state your body is in survival mode. So… so afterwards you look down, and you get a cut on your arm. You're like, "I'm bleeding now." What if the kid goes home with a big handprint on their arm from an adult? And we didn't, we didn't know that. Imagine what parents gonna think, do and say, when they look at their kids forearm, and there's an adult handprint mark on it. All right, it's gonna be bad that's why that documentation piece is so important and looking and follow up afterwards and you call the parent, of course, and email, and say this is what happened. Of course it would be written up in a crisis report and say we did have to hold onto Bobby's arm. And this is how we did it and why we did it. Umm… and there's, there's, there's bad stories about different stuff. You know, kids going home with marks on her arm, or ring-a-ring imprint from somebody's, you know, ring digging into the skin, cuts, uh… I know of one situation where a kid went home, and this was not true by the way but he went home and told his Mom. He was locked in a closet. He was not locked in a closet. He was in a, in a timeout area. But the school didn't communicate that. See, and so then the parent gets upset, and you know, what you're locking my kid in the closet. So that's why that linear communication is so important between parent and… and school. Think about your kids you're working with, and should you add or change diffusion techniques, should you add or change distraction techniques, is there something in the safety plan that maybe you can adjust, and what about de-escalation, and if you have things that you're doing that are working like diffusion, or distraction, or safety plan things, or de-escalation things by all means keep using them. In fact if you wanna share 'em, share 'em. Those are, those are, those are great. I asked in, in another presentation. I asked for ideas. Somebody raised their hand. And this is one I hadn't thought of or done, and I thought "Well, this is great." She said she's a teacher. She has a behavior resource room. And she says, "I keep a lot of my stuff in totes." You know, plastic totes just easier. She was one, one of my kids get escalated. I just grabbed one of my totes, like I'm getting up my stuff. And then I act like I trip. I just throw my stuff everywhere. And she goes it just totally breaks up the whole room. And kids are coming over. And they're helping me, pick things up, and I act like I'm hurt, you know, and clumsy, and I'm upset because I… and the kids are coming over and making sure I'm all right. She was, "It just totally works every time." And I said, "Great, yeah, that's excellent." And that works for you. And the kids obviously care about you. And it breaks up the whole thing. Yeah, it physically does something too. So I was a wonderful idea that I uh… I heard about, you know, I tend to be, you know, pretty, I… I try to be pretty calm in my voice. So a lot of things I say to kids, you know, or to try to get them to not be embarrassed in the social situation. So you know, I might say, "Hey, go the restroom, splash some water in your face, then come back out when you're ready." And that's physiologically cooling off, but also it's kind of getting out of the situation. You know, it's kind of let's, let's, let's do a reboot and you know, out of sight out of mind. You know, so they get out of there and the kids kind of forget 'cause you're on to the next thing. But you're staying right there kind of stays in the mess. All right, any questions on that on the, on the crisis stuff? I'm gonna go on to knowing compliance. 

04:16:00
[sil.] 

04:16:05
SCOTT WALLS Okay. Non-compliance is kids not doing what they're supposed to be doing, of course. We should really look at reinforcing for compliance because we can always find compliance. Our egos tend to stop us from reinforcing uh… positives because we end up starting to only notice the negatives and that's easy to do. You get, you get can't pulled into a kid that has these really irritating behaviors. And pretty soon, you're just gonna constantly, its like, yeah! You ever, you know, you find yourself constantly correcting them, and sometimes even dreading that you got to work with them. You know as a mental health clinician, you know, it's true. And I think, it's true for probably anybody who's done this for a while. You have clients sometimes that you just kind of hope don't show up. And, and they do show up. And you have to do your work and, and… and but that's a, that's a feeling that you get. You know, and if you're an educator, you have students that are never sick, you know, they're always there and even if they are sick they're there. And, and that's kind of this uh… don't I ever get a break, do I ever get a chance for just? Well, we all have bias. We all have our issues. We all have things about other people that bother us. And anybody who says they don't is lying. We all have those issues. It's just are we gonna be the professional and admit it and look at this kid really gets under my skin. And why do they get under my skin? Because maybe they remind me of myself, or maybe they do a behavior that I'm really I just really don't like, maybe they don't smell good, maybe they have a just a personality that's abrasive, maybe their parent is hard to deal with and so therefore I kind of transfer that to the kid. There's a lot of things that a kid can say, do not say how they act, the way they flip their hair, the way they wear their clothes, the eye roll that they do, or the kids that say I don't know, or they mock you, or they uh… you know, say I don't care, or they argue, or they swear, there's always something. But could we use some of those things? Recognize, okay, this is my issue. But how can I turn around and help that kid? All right, how can I turn around and connect with that kid using the very thing about them that drives me crazy? Am I gonna constantly try to oppose that? Or am I going to embrace it? It's kind of like verbal judo, you know, there's a time to pull and there's a time to push. You know, so kid is we'll go back to Johnny and the cookies. I remember Johnny, he took the cookies and… and the whole thing, and then mom said "Did you take the cookies?" And Johnny said, "No." And he lied, and gotten too gotten this big whoopty-doo. And if you find yourself trapped, and trapped, and sucked into that argument, you, you kind of need to push on the brakes and just call it for what it is, Johnny you got me. You got me stuck in an argument. I'm stopping the argument. I'm not gonna argue with you anymore. You took the cookies. You didn't ask. Conversation over, and you walk away. Johnny can be upset. He can be mortified that he's never getting any cookies again. But we're done. Did you call it for what it is, you got sucked into an argument, so what? All right, because nobody's perfect. And I, I get stuck in arguments sometimes with kids. You know, and I, it's like this one-upmanship, and you know, you can't do that. Yeah, I can. No, you can't. Why not 'cause I said so you're not the boss of me. Yeah, I am. No, you're not. Yeah. And then we're getting back in the (inaudible ) precinct if you like her in second grade. All right, and you're thinking gears oh, I'm so much smarter than this. But you, you go down that rabbit hole. And you're in their world. Right? So if you get stuck, and everybody will it's okay, you know, give yourself permission to hey, I blew it. All right, guess what Johnny, you still don't get the cookies because we don't do this here. All right, so you got away with it this time. Next time you won't because I won't have the cookies. All right, so you're teaching Johnny. And of course, you wanna go back to be all reinforcing him and teaching him how does he get to the cookies. Getting compliance from non compliance students, break up requests, if we give multiple requests, we do a couple things. First of all it's hard to follow multiple requests, directions. But also we give multiple chances to be defiant. And then where do we start with the correction? So get out your pencil, get out your paper, get out your books, you know, get out your backpack, and they haven't done anything. I told you to get out. And then you go through it again. All right, so break up the request, and a good way to do that is visual schedules. I like. I like those. But a simple request might be okay. Get out your pen. You know, obviously one direction, very simple direction. Thank you which comes with the praise right after it. All right, and that might seem time-consuming. It might seem Oh, my gosh, I shouldn't have to." But when we start saying that to ourselves, realize now we're saying what it the way it should be, or shouldn't be. And that's a faulty thought. It's called the irrational belief. Think of the time I'm gonna spend arguing with him about the fact that he or she didn't do it. Now so I'm gonna save time on the back end but taking a little more time on the front end by breaking it up one simple request and immediately praise. I, I call this hit and run. I'm going to tell somebody what I wanted to do. I'm not gonna ask them to do it. I'm gonna tell them politely. And I'm gonna smack them with praise right away. Well, before they've had a chance to do it or not, I'm gonna nail them in a good way with my praise, or the reinforcements, whatever that might be. Let me give you a demonstration using an imaginary person here 'cause I don't have anybody up here. All right, so I want Johnny. And Johnny is this is his chair. And I want him to sit down. That's my goal. All right, and Johnny is oppositional behavior issues. Now if I wait around for him to do it, I could be waiting a while. Right? 'Cause if I say Johnny, please sit down and, and I'm waiting for him to actually complete my directions before I say good job. There already is a power struggle. Now if Johnny is a, a very nice well-behaved student, I probably don't have to ask him to sit down anyway. He'll just do it. Right? Or he sees everybody else sitting. And he'll just sit because that's what he does. And he follows directions. And, or, you know, I could come up say, "Oh, it's time to sit down." He does it. And then all right, but he's not, he's not, he's not well behaved, doing exactly what supposed to do. He, he resists a lot of adult command. So I come by, and I do a hit and run. Johnny sit down. Thank you. I appreciate it so much. And I, I hit him around and leave. So there's, there's no chance for the rebuttal. Okay, there's no chance for him to come back. You know, no, no. Because I've decided this is not the hill I'm dying on the day. This is not worth it. I'm making a conscious decision to fill his bucket or to give him a deposit in the bank. I'm also making a decision to be the actor in the situation. I'm not gonna be the reactor. You see the reactor is subordinate to the actor. All right, reactor is this, Johnny is sitting down. And then he stands up, and I see it and I go, "Johnny, you're supposed to be sitting." So Johnny sits. He stands back up, Johnny knock it off, get down. I'm constantly reacting to his behavior. Who's in charge here? Well, it's Johnny. All right, so instead I wanna flip that around. All right, so I told Johnny to sit down. I did in my hit-and-run, what? And he didn't sit down. He still hasn't followed my directions. Let's say, he, he's still standing. So what do I do now? Well, I come back to that. If that's really a, a thing that I need him to do, obviously sitting down is, is… is the behavior I'm representing here. I come back to it. And I sprays him again for doing something because I can always find compliance. Thank you for staying in your spot, I appreciate so much. Bam! Another hit and run. Now I've put him in a double bind. You see, he's, I praised him for both things that he's doing. If he's gonna be defiant, he has to work for it. I'm making defiance inconvenient. So if it's truly worth it to him to be defiant, then he will have to generate energies to become defiant. He's gonna have to kneel. He's gonna have to do jumping jacks, or he's gonna have to lay down, or something to be truly defiant. And we can't stop every behavior from happening, but you can stop enabling it. Enabling is something that allows a behavior to continue, actually sometimes encourages it to continue. So you can certainly do something about that. PCP and PPP are approaches that their acronyms for uh… Praise Correct Praise and Praise Point Out The Problem Praise. I'm praising for a correct behavior, doing my correction, praising again. All right, I'll go back to Johnny here. Okay, Johnny, a great job being in class on time, I do need you to sit down right now. Thank you, I appreciate so much that you, you're on time. Okay, now I sandwich my correction between two praises. It's a much easier thing to take. But what is more important is that I have recognized him for a behavior that is good, you were on time. You were punctual. You're here. I'm recognizing the fact that I like it that you're here. So you see, a lot of times we take for granted just the behaviors that happen that are, that are good expected behaviors. Or we have forgotten that, that was an original behavior that we were dealing with. Okay, and then I'd do this too. So Johnny used to be late all the time. Now he's on time. All right, and… and I forget because time passes and other behaviors come up, I forget that wait a minute, wait a minute, three months ago, he was late every day. That was my goal, get to class on time quit messing around. Now he's in class on time every day just not in his seat. And I'm focusing on him being out of seat. Wait a minute, Scott, think about it. You're going against the very thing that you wanted to in the first place. So Johnny, I'll love you that you have freak-out. You know, I love you are on time. That's amazing, that's so good. So maybe I'm gonna overdo it even. But I need you to be in your seat. Because when you're happy to see, you bother me. And you make me old. Okay, so thank you. I love it that you're here on time so that's if my praise is a big deal or if it's a visual reinforcer, then I'm gonna reinforce it. If it's a tangible, I'm gonna do that. All right, praise point out the problem is a similar thing. I'm pointing out what is wrong but sandwich it between praises umm… some, some ways to do that middle part. It doesn't always have to be just pointing out the problem. Maybe you want them to just do it again. Maybe it's something that they have to practice over and over. Maybe I wanna help you do this better, or an easier way to get that done is, who doesn't like easier? All right, Johnny, you're doing a good job working on the assignment. I like it. You got your stuff out. You know, an easier way to do this would be thanks for keep doing the job. Now I'm gonna leave 'cause maybe he doesn't know how I do that. You know, he wants to argue. But no I'm not gonna do that today 'cause I've decided not the hill to die on. Okay, it's easy to get sucked into those things, isn't it? And but kids with ODD, oppositional defiant disorder, our masters at this. They, it's like they written the script for this. All right, with the group, you praise the whole group to make sure that the group feels reinforced class a little bit how everybody's got their eyes on the teachers eyes that's amazing, Hope I can get everybody, everybody's eyes. Thank you. So I've made my correction with the one over here that's not paying attention, but I praise my whole group. All right, now the whole group feels hey, you know, because there's kids in the group that never get praise because they're always doing the right thing. They just kind of get, you know, you know, don't have to worry about them. Now I got to worry about this one. Guaranteed success is setting up the student to be successful regardless this helps to avoid the shutdown situation, and builds the notion that small successes lead to bigger successes, heirless learning or correction, correct errors by providing the correct answer instead of leaving the student feeling stuck, frustrated, or even embarrassed. Have you ever felt that way in a class? Where you were stuck, you didn't understand something, and then put on the spot 'cause you didn't know it. And then pressured, maybe by other people, "Come on, let's go." You know, yeah, can be terrifying to people that's why you wanna avoid certain situations. That's why a lot of people come to my seminars. And they've been to other seminars, and they're scared to sit in the front row. Why? Because other seminars have made people in the front row come up and go and do something, our, our volunteer and I never do that. I make it a point to do that. You notice I didn't pick on anybody here today. All right, there's a reason for that because I don't wanna do that to people. I don't want it done to me. Okay, so let me go to the first one, guaranteed success. Let me give you an example of this, umm… this is something I would do, I've done in my karate school. Let's say I'll pick something fun today. Instead of an academic task, I would pick something fun. Let's say, I want one of you to come up, and you're gonna break a board today with your hand. All right, and I have you come up. And, and I got a board, and the, and you hit the board, and you hit. And it doesn't break, and you hurt your hand. It's like "Uh…" Embarrassing! Right? In front of everybody, it didn't break. Well, that was totally horrible, wasn't it? It hurt my hand, didn't break the board. Everybody laughed. I don't wanna do that. Big fail, right? Instead I don't wanna do that. I wanna guarantee your success. First of all, I don't know if you can do it. So I gotta teach you the skill, so I'm going back, my teaching skills, so you know, how to do it so we're gonna show you how to break a board. I'm not gonna show you with a, with a board. I'm gonna show you with a piece of paper. You know, you're gonna hit this piece of paper, you gotta hit it. You're gonna hit it. You're gonna hit it. You're gonna hit it, and it's just paper. Right? And every time, do you have the technique down to? You have the skill, and then we're gonna, they're gonna use something soft and may have you hit something soft over, and over, and over till I know you know, how to do it. Then we're gonna get out the real board. We're gonna put your name on it. Your board now, putting the date on it. I'm gonna sign it. I'm gonna put a big target on it where you're gonna hit it. In fact if there's other people in here, I'm gonna have every base sign it. So it's the board that you get to keep you're gonna break it, and you're gonna keep it. There smell it, you're gonna touch it, and hold it. All right, you know, how to do it because I've showed you. Now here's the critical piece. I as the teacher, I'm going to hold the board because if I just hold put the board between two bricks, let's say, there's still a question of whether you'll get it you, you probably would. But I need to guarantee success here. So the guaranteed part is I'm holding the board. No matter where you hit this board, it's gonna break. Now you're, you're probably gonna hit it right in the middle because you've had enough practice. But sometimes people get nervous, and they, "Yeah." And they hit it like and it breaks. All right, and then you go "Uh…" And if there's the audience they clap, and as it feels good. Right? I did it. And what do you want to do now? Now you wanna break two boards? You wanna break more. Because you have a platform of success that you're operating from, and you feel confident, and what I have done is build your confidence and your competency. In other words, your skill is now increased. And increased competency leads to confidence. You see, confidence comes from one place. It comes from achievement. And you can think you're awesome at something which is that kind of a narcissistic view that people get sometimes. But unless you are awesome at it, you don't have true confidence. Confidence comes from achieving things. Well, a lot of our kids don't achieve anything. Because sometimes they don't try. Or they have tried, and they failed, and say "Nope." So guaranteed success is a way to build compliance an operating from a position of success instead of failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, failure, you've got to be a very resilient person to go" Okay." Every time I do this I fail, so now I'll just try again. All right, I mean, how many of you operate from a position of failure and thrive from that. You know, so could we learn from our failure? Sure! But you gotta have a lot of insight. And you gotta have some maturity so when you do that. You gotta have a personal Drive, and an internal drive to really go, you know, what I failed a bunch, now I'm gonna really succeed this time. I mean, you've got to be highly motivated to do that. Errorless learning a correction is a similar method is that now they have actually committed an error. It's wrong. Okay, but if I tell them it's wrong, they will completely lose it or they'll just shut down. So I wanna make the correction without them suffering through the process of feeling stuck or frustrated. Okay? All right, so let's say I'm working on my computer and it freezes up. All right, and I don't know what to do? And you come over and tell me, "Well, you hit the wrong button that's why it's frozen." Does that help me get unstuck? No. That makes me wanna yell at you. Okay, the computer is stuck, but if you come over and go oh, I love it that you're working on your project now here. You fix it for me. All right, and I go, "Oh, what you do?" And then you can tell me what you did. Oh, oh, next time if that happens, you just do that. Really? Oh, cool. You fixed my error without telling me that I had it wrong. All right, let me give you a real simple example. Let's say Susie is doing various a very simple thing identifying objects. Okay and we've got a cup. And we've got paper. And so I asked her to tell me what is this. And she says, "Paper." Excellent, well, she got it right. And then I said, "What is this?" She says, "It's a phone." All right, now if I say no that's not a phone, it's a cup. And she'll get mad. Right? Because I've told her it's wrong. And I, I corrected her. Instead I go back and I say, "You know what you said this was what? What was that paper? Yeah, give me, give me a five. All right, this is a cup. Can you say cup, cup. All right, good job. Now we ran a little reinforcer, big reinforcer. She had this one, right? Now let's do this one again that's paper I told you. You're so smart. And what was this again? Cup. She made the correction. All right, so now we have fixed that one. She's unstuck on that. But if we stay stuck or if I keep saying Okay, think about it, what is it? You know, you know, well, she is starting to get mad. But you're right you have kids safe. I don't know, I don't know. I don't know is about an assertive answer is you can get right I do not know. So I don't know often is they do really, they do really don't know. Or if it's I don't wanna say, or I don't wanna tell you, and you can clarify that. But why be stuck there when you don't have to? All right, so those are some ways to get success. This is a choice map. This is a visual way to create actually control and to give kids choices. You're making a visual map of their potential choices based on a situation. We have here anger. So when you're angry, choice A is use your coping skills and that could be drawn out, it could be nice picture of whatever that might be. And when you use your coping skills even when you're angry, you still get to whatever that might be go to recess, get playtime, whatever you wanna call it. Choice B is to hurt other people, throw things. That equals this. Now I have a visual depiction of exactly what will happen on either one of these. I can take the high road. I can take the low road. Now I've done it with an emotion here. And on a therapist and I kind of think that way but you could do it with conditions if you're a, if you're an educator like, finished my work early. Okay, umm… have to do personal reading. Let's say they don't like personal reading. I can choose a new person to do my homework. I mean, there's a lots of things that you can put in there besides any motion. All right, when I go back to this slide here, that had these all listed out more about compliance, cause effect statements because you did this, now this happens because you did this, now this doesn't happen. All right, because you ate your vegetables. Now you get dessert, Johnny, because you asked me now you get a cookie. Because you ate your vegetables, now you're gonna have a cookie, because you didn't eat your vegetables, you don't get cookies. It's a cause and effect you're building that connection. This is the cognitive part. You're building the connection between what you did and what happened. It's called action reaction if then points it out before you do it. Johnny, if you eat your vegetables, then you'll get the cookie. So now Johnny knows the contingency to get to the cookies. I'm training him ahead of time to avoid the whole big whoop-de-doo about the cookie that happens earlier. Okay, I've decided that this is how you get the cookie. And kids respond the rules. But it can't be an imaginary rule that we just make up on the go. Right? It has to be a rule that they know about. So Johnny, the way to get the cookies is to make sure you eat your vegetables 'cause I want you to grow up to be big and strong. All right, if you don't eat your vegetables, that's fine. It's your choice. No cookie. First then points it out the order, first we work then we play. Okay, first we eat our vegetables then we the cook. Poor Johnny, he's gonna get a cookie sooner or later. All right, first then, then points out the next step, first we do this, then we do this, then we do this, so you're building on so with little kids you would start very first we do this, and we do this. As kids get older first then, then, then you could add in their step. First then, then, then a choice map makes it visual. All right, Okay, so we left off where it says working with students that have experienced uh… trauma, uh… we wanna follow your schools reporting procedures if you suspect abuse. I think that's easy to do work with your child's caregivers to share school problems, refer to community resources when a child shows signs of being unable to cope with traumatic stress. Community resources, mental health agencies, many mental health providers are trained and what to do with trauma. And those that aren't know where to find people that are trained what to do with trauma. Share trauma FAQs for educators with other teachers, and school professional, uh… school personnel so umm… that's taken from the National Child traumatic stress Network, a lot of this information is so. Let me share with you some of those trauma facts and things that you can do in a, for school professionals 'cause that is who this uh… seminar is geared for mostly eight things school professionals can do to help students with trauma, create a safety plan, safe places, and uh… safe people, so the safety plan we have… we have gone over. But safe places, a place I can go when I don't feel okay, and or a person I can go to, to feel safe, establish boundaries, rules and parameters. This is important for if you're a clinician, but also if you're in a school, setting the boundaries are healthy, and all these lies times think about trauma what is this done, especially things like child abuse, uh… you know, sexual assault things like that. Boundaries were violated. Most people that are assaulted or assaulted by somebody that they know and so umm… that boundary has been violated and establishing a healthy boundary is important first for safety but also to protect that person umm… rules, and procedures, parameters give you how do I act in this environment. Uh… if I came to your house, you have rules of your house. How do you act? And I would need to know those so I don't violate your rules of your home. If you come to my business, I'm gonna give you a quick tour. In fact I even post the rules in, in our newsletter for parents, because sometimes parents violate our rules. So there's things that I expect and things that I don't expect. I first since I am against sideline coaching when parents coach their kids from the sideline. So they do this. It drives me crazy. It's one of my pet peeves but also it's very disruptive. And so I'm pretty quick to tell people, "This is a rule. This is how we do things here." Umm… so they know. Crisis plan, well, that's what you do in a, in an unsafe situation, provide structure routine and consistency, prime and prepare, what this is… is preparing kids for potentially stressful situations, getting them ready so that they're not surprised. Utilizing a person's strengths, it's our strengths that help us overcome our weaknesses. It's our strengths, our passions, our hopes, our desires, our beliefs that help us escape from our ghosts of our pasts, and… and find a find a new way in life. Be present what that means is you are, you are there in the moment with people. Sometimes the only thing that we can do is be there, and only not is I'm not minimizing it it's just that that's what you can do. You're just there for that person. You're a listener. You're present, and it's our human presence that human affection that is one of the things that binds us together. And it's probably one of the most effective things you can do specially when somebody's in a experience of massive grief. Umm… ask for help uh… like I said if you are not trained in trauma asking mental health people for assistance, for, for help, what do I do very important umm… that's kind of a that kind of general recommend mendacious. Let me get a little more specific with a special segment of the population that has a traumatic background. These kids uh… have more aspects of trauma and attachment disorder. And I don't like calling people by their title. I don't like using the term rad kids. You might have heard that before reactive attachment disorder. I think, it's dismissive, and we, and we group kids you know, and say, "Oh, the rad kids this." And, and a lot of stuffs misunderstood anyway. So I made up my own title that I thought sounded much better and so you won't find this in any diagnostic manual because I made it up. And, and talked about it being an oppositional defiant, I guess, I am a little bit but umm… the acronym is… is a highly emotional resistant oppositional kids which spells out hero. Okay, uh… these kids are very emotional. Their rage is significant. Their sadness is profound. Their happiness is silly and wild often they're, they're sullen attitude is very… very deep. Umm… everything they do is… is more. It is intense. Their lying is extreme. Umm… they are resistant. They're pretty stubborn. They are pretty guarded. They have poor boundaries and so and they, they're pretty resistant to people telling them what to do. They're even resistant to things like praise. "Hey, good job, Bobby." And they turn around and kick in the shin and call you name. Because their safety threshold, this is so much different. When you have been violated at a very early age, when you were abandoned when you're a baby, when you weren't fed, when you were a toddler, when you were locked in a closet, you know, horrific things that happen, you went into survival mode at a period of your life where you should have never had to go into survival mode. So your survival instincts which is the fight, flight, freeze submit is so much closer to the surface. So of course you're gonna resistant to some, some gestures which are genuine an affection, or just simple praise, or things like that you might be resistant to somebody trying to just be nice to you, you know, and these kids are oppositional. So they often get put labelled as behavior disorder or severe emotional disturbance things like that umm… which I suppose is fine to give them educational services but really the… the uh… origin of it is much different. Uh… these kids tend to sabotage their own success. They, let's say they're gonna complete an assignment, it's gonna be 100%, and then they tear it up before they could ever turn it in. It's like nope. I'm not gonna let you see this. I'm not gonna let you pat me on the back. They respond poorly to emotional conversations. So kids like this respond better to matter-of-fact factual statements. If you uh… take highly emotional resistant opposition kids, of course it spells out hero. Why hero? Because these kids are about as resilient as you get. These kids are survivors. They are resilient. They're heroes. That's what heroes are. Heroes are resilient. Heroes get knocked down. Heralds have terrible lives if you… if you watch the movie, or the TV show Gotham, you know, which is… which is a great show. I love it. And it's about a young Batman who's before he's Batman, and a young Jim Gordon. And the… the all the villains that are, you know, before they were the famous ones that we know they were these, you know, other characters and… and the whole idea is this horrible traumatic event and… and how young… young Bruce Wayne is resilient and a survivor. And all the superheroes have that in common so that's why I came up with this. And it makes me feel different to describe kids this way instead of using these diagnostic clinical terms. These kids are often thought of as being manipulative deceitful and deviant. I don't like describing kids that way so I don't do that. I describe them as being sneaky, and tricky, and cunning. All right, they're always trying to get yeah, you know, or just tricky. And so what I did was I compiled some data and summarized from uh… the resource I listed here, this first page is 10 interventions that do not work for kids with attachment issues and trauma issues. Uh… plain and simple, and stuff doesn't work. Umm… hopefully that's helpful. You know, this is the interventions that do work. All right, so I think it's important to go back to look at the stuff that does not work and see are we doing any of this kind of stuff. And maybe you're not working with kids that are on this spectrum. But, but if you are uh… you'll, you'll find like, "Oh, wait a minute. No wonder." We're getting bad results with this. We know that traditional problem-solving questions uh… don't work vague, praise, umm… consistent zero tolerance policies uh… don't work, setting the parents up to be heavy. Some of the stuff I've mentioned already is you've heard me say some of this stuff already today. And you're like, "Well, what, what do you mean? Do I do this with all kids?" Uh… Its trauma-informed the care goes beyond working just with kids with trauma. Trauma-informed care is kind of good for all of us. You know, what I mean? It's sensitive to our feelings, to our anxieties. And I think, it's important to note that trauma-informed care is often used with people identified with trauma. But how many kids are all of us in contact with that have trauma that we don't know about. And see, we don't know about all the stuff that's going on with kids, and that's important. I think, all of our behavior management, and the mental health treatment should be trauma-informed. Trauma is sensitive because you never know when somebody has had trauma, and they just haven't told anybody. All right, and not everybody tells everybody. You know, that's the way it is boys especially a lot of times it's looked at is uh… You know, that's being weak, or vulnerable, or it's my fault, you know, uh… people that have abused kids will often tell them. If you tell anybody, you'll be in trouble, or hurt you, or hurt your family, or it's your fault. You know, you came on to me, and all that kind of stuff. So there's all the… the shame that goes along with this, and then some of our, some of our treatment sometimes, you know, holds kids and… and behavior management holds them a little too responsible about stuff that really it wasn't their fault. So trauma-informed care is really being sensitive to stress and anxiety and how it plays to a person's development. So uh… In terms of what does work, you know, you look at the list, I think, it's, I think, this, that's pretty cut-and-dried. I think it's pretty clear. Uh… I like to use my sense of humor uh… to just laugh kids stuff off. I mean, they're trying to say words that deliberately trying to get you mad, and stuff like that. You… you get to use your sense of humor sometimes. You know, it's one of the best things that we have. And is it approving of their message? No. It's showing that it's just a word. Okay, we tell kids all the time, they're just words. Right? And another kid says something to them with Tom, it's just words, don't worry about it, sticks and stones the whole thing. Right? But then when kids do it to us, we get all upset. We got to follow our own advice, laugh it off, brush it off. Be like Elsa(ph). Right? Let it go. Those of you working with little kids, you know what I'm talking about. All right, keep praise very specific. All right, connect it specifically, don't just say good job all the time. Good job… good job, because that ends up being uh… a manipulation, so hopefully that helps work, working with those kids. And I wanna talk a little bit about shift to escape behaviors, try to cover all the avenues here, and the time that I have left. So kids are leaving. They're leaving our area whatever our area is. Let's try to figure out why they're leaving our area. And develop a, a communication system. How can I tell you when it's time for you to take a break? How can you tell me when you need a break? Are we gonna work on a hand signal? Are we gonna work on a visual cue card? I love break escape card just on the bottom there. A break card is simple. It says uh… where you go for your break. Like, let's say it's a nervous card. So I… I'm sensing you're getting a little bit agitated, so I give you (inaudible ) I just flashed the nurse card that means you get up and go to the nurse. Take a quick break, nurse goes, check your temperature whatever it is he come back. Or you show me the break card when you think you need a break. So you're monitoring, this is self-monitoring, emotional regulation. You're like, "I'm starting to get. I'm starting to get kind of funny feeling." And then you take your break card out. No penalty for that. I'm assigning the escape or you're assigning the escape, we're taking something that is typically spontaneous. And I'm prescribing the symptom. And when you do that you take away the oppositional nature of it, and you make it overt. Okay, now let's say that the kid is leaving, they are on their way out. Okay, I might say to them "Johnny, I know you're taking a break right now. I hope you're okay." Now, now Johnny might be sticking his tongue out at me. And I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna show you. Okay, but I'm acknowledging that I know he's taking a break. I hope you're okay. I'll see you in a little bit. Now I've just taken away the oppositional spikes of… of his behavior those spikes were the things that's sticking to us, right? So I'm taking that away. Acknowledging and saying, I want you to come back. All right, I like to give kids special jobs. Older kids don't call them special jobs too babyish. Areas of responsibility, AORs in my school, we have a whole whiteboard. One of the kids made it. It was what it was his AOR to make it, so he made this poster. It's a whiteboards got a bunch of lines on it. And it's got jobs on the side of it like, 20 year, I can't have, its 25 different jobs. And it might be like, water the plants. We've got vacuuming on there. We've got the pitch. We've got uh… clean the treasure box out, and pretty fun stuff most of it. Umm… and then names by it so at any point you're doing your AOR, those are escapes obviously. And more importantly, their contributions, they are contributing to the welfare of the class the, the group, the organization, the school. It's like kids doing chores at home. Okay, and you don't get paid for chores. I hope, right? Kids shouldn't get paid for chores because chores are a part of living. Little kids pick up things off the floor because that's what little kids can do. And kids, and big kids can do big, bigger things. And they get really big they can mow the lawn. All right, and you can do that stuff. And you don't get paid because that's a part of living. And there's a sense of responsibility to each other. And I appreciate it. All right, and, and nobody has cleaned the toilets more than I have at that place. But I appreciate when they are clean forming, and you know, what it feels good to do things, nice things for other people. It just feels good. We forget that reinforcement isn't always the obvious token economy that kind stuff. Reinforcement is doing something nice for other people just because that's what you do and you feel good about it. ou walk away, you know, like, you know, what I… I made the world a better place today. I tell my students, "Integrity is a good thing that you do that nobody else ever sees." All right, that's one definition of integrity. We have a character theme each month. All right, and one of those months a theme is something like respect or integrity. And so we talk to kids about that. This month, we happen to be on cooperation. So we can be working on teamwork drills, and all kind of stuff working together. So then we do games, and things like this, that you can have to cooperate. So I'm weaving in social skills, character education into my lessons. Why? Because there's some deficits there, well, some of my kids. They are there too technically learn martial arts. But my job is to teach so much more than that. So you may be the reading teacher, but you are teaching more than reading. And we all know that. Okay, you may be the school counselor, but you're doing more than scheduling and getting kids to go to their classes and doing, you know, a group on, you know, bullying or something like that. You are providing also supports throughout your school, and so on, and so forth. So my point of these special jobs is not only do they provide escapes, there's a huge benefit to this kind of a thing. Umm… and a responsibility really to each other to take care of each other, and take care of things. And that taps into what we talked about this morning about motivation. If I'm the type of person that likes too take care of things, like animals, or plants, or feed the fish, or whatever and that makes me feel good. Why shouldn't I not be given those opportunities to do that? If I'm the type of person that likes to follow people which is fine, I need good people to follow, right? Kids should also be given reasons to stay. The average high school student, I read an article a while back I wish I remembered where it was from it said, "The average high school student is bored, stressed, and exhausted." Wow! That's sad. They're bored. And I know a kid who's, who's gifted. Maybe he might be highly gifted. And he went, he went into high school. And I said, "How was high school going?" And he goes, "You know, there's one class I like." I said, "What class is that." He goes, "Chorus." I guess fair it was because it was an easy class. I said, "Why do you like it?" He goes, "Because the teacher is passionate about what we do." He goes, "It's a hard class. He goes, "We have to sing and say." And he's like constantly pushing us but I love it because he's so freaking, weird about doing air. He's like, he's just in a zone. And I said, "What about…" I think, I can't remember his gifted area if it's English or whatever it is. I said, "What about your gifted, your diff class?" He goes, "Hate it." I said, "Why?" He goes, "Because the teacher is totally disinterested." It's like they can't wait for the day to get over. It's just, and this is a well-behaved kid. This is not a kid that would ever cause you any kind of problem. This is a kid that does is stuff. Umm… I'm like that's stuff. You know, that a well-behaved kid is telling me this kind of stuff. But if it, but if on a national basis, our high school kids are bored stressed and exhausted. And I… and I don't know what elementary kids are feeling. But something, something's going on. You know, we can do something about the exhausted. I think, we get in the sleep better start their school day later by the way. If anybody's listening, you know, on there that's responsible for school schedules. We know, we know, we know, we know that high school students would do better if they started later and went later in the day but heaven forbid that we interrupt sports schedule. So I know, it little passive-aggressive comment but it's true. So I thought I'd throw it, throw it out there. It's getting towards the end of the day, so forgive me if I started getting a little flippant. Umm… re, refusal behaviors, somebody had asked me during the break about kids that uh… they refuse used to do stuff. It's very frustrating. I… I think I'd rather have a kid that's irritating, and annoying, and bothering everybody than a kid that just digs in, and just stops operating. It just will not budge. Umm… so I like a visual schedule for these kids because the visual schedule is always there. It's just a constant reminder of what you need to do. And a lot of times these kids are stuck. They're stuck in their thinking and when they get stuck, I mean, it's just like, they're spinning their wheels. They cannot get unstuck, their thinking just it paralyzes them. Sometimes its shyness, sometimes its anxiety umm… so that visual schedules like that reminder of AOR. This is what I do. A lot of times we wait for the end result to actually reinforce somebody when you can actually reinforce them for the effort that they show. All right, so if it's taking one step towards progress, excellent, I love how you're trying hard. All right, it's that encouragement to go up the hill. You know, it's the encouragement to try a little harder. Umm… show them how to do it. Maybe they really don't know. And that sometimes we have to repeat this process 'cause by teaching and re-teaching. We're also able to assess does this child have a skill deficit or performance deficit I talked about earlier. What kind of learner are they? Are they a visual learner? Are the auditory? Are they can aesthetic? We need to teach towards how they learn most to get them unstuck. What kind of player are they? In other words what type of coaching do they respond to the best? Okay, let me give you three coaching styles. And you think about how would you respond to those particular coaching styles. Because it's not one style fits all. There is a coaching style out there that you'll see. You see this on TV too. The demanding and commanding style, these coaches and teachers demand the command their students, or their players to perform better. They yell at them. Tell them to get moving, come on, let's go, faster, faster, faster, up the hill, down the hill. And if you ever taken a fitness boot camp, that's a lot of these instructors how they do it. You know, they learnt they're people sweating, and suffering, and you, and you pay your money to go there and sweat and suffer because you wouldn't sweat and suffer without that person there. And you might not like 'em but by golly they make you sweat and burn calories. Okay, the other style so some of you might like that style. The other style is more of the gentle, nudging, and the, what I call the personal touch it's the person who, you know, touches you on the shoulder and says, "Okay, I need you to run as hard as you can do it. You can do it for me." And you get that type of player that responds to that they'll do it because you're being nice, and you're gentle, and you're safe. Okay. And some of you respond better to things like that because that's just your nature and that's okay too. Now some people are the content copier. What I mean by this is, they don't want to be demanded and commanded what to do. And they certainly don't need to gentle touch. They need somebody to follow. And they need to be able to copy, let me see you do it. And some of you may be learners like that. I'm a learner like that. Okay, I need to see you do it, so I can understand it. So if you were showing me how to use a computer program, you could yell at me all you want and that's not gonna help. And you can give me a pat on the back and encourage me, that's not gonna help. I need to see you how you do this. Tell me, show me what buttons you push. Wait, wait, wait, wait what did you click on, what did, did you do? Go back, I didn't see it. Again I don't, you don't, I don't need any coaching style. I need to see it. That makes sense? All right, there's another way to think about this which isn't really on here. It's, it's more of a fun way to look at things instead of it always, always being kind of a serious thing. Uh… think about what type of personality a person is? You know, you, if you, if you know in a workplace for instance or in this classroom, it four main personalities. And, and these aren't like personality disorder personality. This is like just fun personality. So yeah, you got to get it done people. You know, how many of you are get it done, people? I may get it done person. Get it done people, we get things done. When there's a job to do, we do it. We don't mess around. We don't think about it. We don't ask people how they feel. We don't need to talk about. We just do it because we're not satisfied until the job is done. That's a great thing about people like me. You want a job done, call me. I'll do it. The bad thing about us is we don't care what other people think. Sometimes we don't have a very good plan. And sometimes people wanna talk about it, and we're not really enough because we're already working on it, right? And then there are thinkers. How many of you were thinkers? Planners, thinkers do such a good job in organizing making lists, prioritizing. If you ever take a kid to a, a thinker kid to a toy store? Okay, you get a pick out a toy. All right, come on, let's go. The store's gonna close. And they finally get a toy, you think all right. And then they make that, and then they got two toys. You only get one, can't make a decision, you send it, you send a thinker to the store to get apples and that's it's a half-hour deal 'cause you get a look at all the apples, you gotta touch the apples what kind of apples you get. Pretty soon, they call you, and what kind of apples am I… guys, supposed to get. So that's the downside to being a thinker. Then there's feelers. Who thinks or who thinks they're a feeler? Emotional people! Therapists are generally good feelers. Feelers are compassionate people. They're warm, they show lots of regard for other people. They would not, umm… they would not get some. They would not go to a restaurant until everybody felt okay about where they're gonna go. They would not wanna hurt somebody's feelings or leave anybody out. And that's, they're wonderful people to be around, problem with being a feeler is you can't make a very happy and so a lot of times things don't get done because kind of "I don't know. I don't wanna bother anybody. And you know, don't want anybody to feel bad about it. And then there's socializers. It's a pretty quiet group. So I don't know if there's any socialize in here. But socializers talk to everybody, and then they talk, and they talk. And the great thing about a socializer is they know what everybody's doing. They know what's going on. They're the movers and shakers. They're great salespeople. Bad thing about socializers, they don't shut up long enough to get anything done. All right, so the point of that bringing up those personalities is if I may get it done personally. And I've got a kid that's a thinker. I could get frustrated with them because it's like come on, let's go. And they're still thinking about it. And they're frustrated with me because I feel, they feel like I'm always pushing them. Or if you get a feeler, they don't wanna, they don't wanna do things because their best friend doesn't like it. Or "No, I'm not gonna do that." Because they don't feel it. And socializers, you need to talk. And so socializers, I'm constantly telling to be quiet because they're socializing. All right, so sometimes it's just a matter of, it's a matter of wills. It kinds of personalities clashing into each other so that refusal behavior can fall along those lines too. Think, especially get it done people are not usually refusal people. So the refusal behavior typically falls into the thinker category. Those kids are thinkers. They're analyzing. A thinker walks into a room and goes, "Umm… there's my friend over there. I don't like that person over there. I wonder what we're doing today. Umm… " And that's a lot of umm… either verbally doing it or in their head they're doing umm… and then somebody says it comes up to him and says, "What would you like to do? And that's like umm… this in, this gasp of. I don't know what I wanna do because I need to think about it. All right, so that can seem like refusal behavior when it's, it's not it's simply they're not there yet. They're not, they're processing it. And they're thinking through it. And they're thinking through it. So visuals again can help because it makes it very overt. It gets them out of their head. Okay, and timers things like that can be pretty good because you daytime, it you put a little timeline on it, you reward them from actually making a decision. Okay, let me switch to talking about anxiety. Remember, I said that was a, the number one mental health category for all ages. So there's quite a bit here under anxiety. And I… and I can't cover it all today but I wanna cover the, the highlights. Umm… well, physiological symptoms can be apparent, physiological meaning body. Cognitive issues are not always as clear and so behavioral things are usually what we see out of kids with anxiety. Uh… behaviors resulting from anxiety primarily exists between the fight and flight characteristics of anxiety with kids with oppositional behavior. Depending on personality traits though umm… some kids will fight first, and then run. Or they'll run first, and then they get cornered, and then they fight. Umm… so for panic and anxiety, the key piece about anxiety, you're gonna hear me say it again is feeling safe. Does the person feel safe in the moment? If not, that is first. The most direct route to helping somebody calm down is actually on the physiological part is getting their body to calm down, uh… so then their brain and their thinking can calm. So uh… deep breaths are a great, great way to start, physical outlets where you're getting rid of the stress is a great way to start. Uh… for deep breathing, I teach this to all kids. It doesn't matter if they have anxiety or not, I just teach it so everybody knows how to do it. You breathe in through your nose like you're gonna go underwater. You know, so you, we didn't through your nose all the way in, hold it one, two, three, and blow out through your mouth like you're blowing up a balloon. Okay, and then you do it again. Breathe in through your nose one, two, three through your mouth, and one more time. So you've done that three times. What you're doing is you're regulating breathing. You're doing breathing with the diaphragm which is getting lots of oxygen in you changing what you're thinking calming yourself down, being able to regulate that heart rate. When people hyperventilate, what they're doing is they're breathing a real shallow which causes a umm… imbalance, and the O2, Co2 exchange. And so you get this kind of panting. We're, we need to be, you know, from down here. You know, really breathing from the belly. Somebody is uh… pretty anxious in the moment uh… techniques kind of to think about say, "Hey, you know, this is not gonna hurt you. This is not that scary. See it, you, you make them realize that this is not a danger. They have to be safe, proof that you survived. Well, what's proof that your survey? You're living. You see, you did something scary, and you're survived. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger? All right, uh… visualization progress, progressive relaxation being reinforced for making it through. Umm… those were all helpful for panic anxiety. What I did here was list strategies different types of strategies. And I'm just gonna quickly list them off. Uh… gradual exposure, gradually exposing a person to an anxiety provoking topic, number one behavioral treatment there is for anxiety, reframing, courage which is helping somebody through something, visualization I had a student once write her graduation announcement umm… because she was freaking out about school. And so I had another student. Umm… write her, uh… wasn't, wasn't graduation. It was write her grade summary. I think it was for a class that she was freaking out about. And I said, I said, "Here's your, here's your final grade like an A or whatever it was." And I said, "I want you to write the summary that the teacher is giving you. So she wrote her own summary. The visualization is very powerful because if we can visualize it, it's like making a dream into a goal and so umm… it, it's putting somebody in a different thought pattern. And they're gonna be leaning towards that self disclosure that's to telling our own story about when you survive something that made you anxious, visuals, charting, I love charts, umm… my favorite charts probably worst case scenario, best case scenario chart, worst case scenario what's the worst thing that could possibly happened in this situation, best-case scenario what usually happens is somewhere in the middle. All right, I did a chart. I don't have that example on here. Umm… it was called uh… planned for the worst, hope for the best. That was the chart. So we're gonna plan for the worst. What's the worst thing that can happen to you? What do we hope is going to happen? And I told the, the kid. I said, "You know, what probably gonna happen is somewhere in the middle. Not near as good as we'd like, but way far from being the worst." And that's exactly what did happen, but because they were prepared for the worst thing. They were less anxious about it because we had already talked about worst-case scenario. Keeping a journal can be helpful for those who like to write, obviously using a person's strengths, prescribed escapes. Depression… much more serious uh… because with depression, all areas of life are impacted. Depression has a very crushing impact on our cognitive ability, but also on our motivation, and our physical selves as well. Of course suicide is the biggest concern when it comes with depression and, and bipolar depression as well, sleep and depression or related, exercise and depression are related, and so it's important to get people engaged, get moving, get outside. I don't care if it's walking the dog, or mowing the lawn, or whatever it is, sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D uh… which makes you feel better in a, in a number of different ways. Uh… it also improves your mood. And just moving exercise is vital because when your body becomes physically tired, you can sleep better. The lack of sleep can trigger manic episodes which in turn means lack of sleep which in turn can lead to very, very serious behavior including psychosis or, or serious mental health conditions. So umm… the good news much of what works for anxiety also works for depression so treatments do work, but with kids, you know, they have to be willing to come in and talk to somebody about their feelings, and all that. And adolescents, this is really hard to do. And you know, there's medications that work too, but medications have side effects and also can make you feel weird, funny. Umm… so if you get those refusal, I ain't talked anybody. And I'm not taking any medication. Well, then we, they were limited to lifestyle changes, right, which is sleeping better, eating better, exercising all that stuff. I had a girl that I was working with who refused to talk to anybody. And she wasn't gonna take any medication. And so I… I had to work with her Mom. I said, "Mom, tell me about your daughter." So daughter has a, daughter were 16 at the time had a little sister 12 year old. And kind of a hyper little thing that the daughter or those the little sister was. And the girl also had a puppy. They had a new puppy in the family. So I said "Mom, here's what I need you to do." You're gonna tell your daughter that it's her responsibility to walk the puppy. She has to take the puppy out, down to the park, they have a park by their house, down to the park that's where you're getting to go. And you're gonna take your little sister with you 'cause I gotta get her out of the house. So the girls like, "I don't wanna go." Well, if you want this puppy, go. And so mom did mom things. You know, what I mean my mom things? She does mom things to get, get out go, walk the dog, here's your sister go. So the girls walking the dog and the dogs they don't hyper little puppy, and all that stuff. But also the sister is gonna come on, and get on this thing. You know, play with me, and that kind of thing and so. What we did was basically tricked her into exercising and getting outside away from the tablet, and the Facebook, and the stuff. 'Cause mom said no, you're not, you're not walking the dog and cross the streets of stuff with your phone. You need, you don't need your phone so give me the phone. Go, get out. Mom's basically saying get out of the house. If you're gonna be miserable that's fine, be miserable walking your dog, and playing with your sister. See, what I mean that's a difference between being miserable, sitting on the internet. No, life is horrible in Facebooking, and texting, and other people are saying how bad their life is too. So gradually, the girl kind of pulled out of it, and then was a little bit more reasonable because her depression was real about seeking some help and actually talking about what was going on. But first we had to kind of get her out of her, out of her thing. Overall strategies I've listed here is a pretty long list. Umm… frequently monitor whether the student has suicidal thoughts is number one, and its bolded. All right, what can you do at a school frequent feedback on performance? Teach the student how to self monitor, uh… teach the problem-solving skills, coach the student and ways to organize plan and execute test demanded daily or weekly in school. Why? Because when you're depressed, you feel kind of like you're in a fog. And you can be very lethargic. It's just like, uh… and so umm… it can be just hard to get out of bed. It can just be hard to do things. Everything seems difficult, and so kidneys ways to organize things because odds are gonna fall behind and which is depressing. All right, so you know, a safe place people are talk to hydration, healthy snacks, why? Because we wanna regulate blood sugar. Dehydration's and the number one cause of headaches. Headaches are also a sign of depression. So we wanna avoid the obvious thing like dehydration's, stay hydrated, keep the blood sugar regulated so you don't get irritable and grouchy. Umm… we wanna identify triggers and coping skills, break cards already talked about that three point scale. Modifications and accommodations that respond to the students fluctuations in mood there may be times a day where they're just crashing and burning. And there's time today where they're gonna feel better. And they're able to uh… produce more work. Umm… social interactions isolation is very dangerous. And somebody is, is depressed. So we need to create social interaction times. They need to be like, like the girl going with her puppy which obviously is not social interacting with her puppy, but her little sister who is just bothering her all the time. She, she is forced to interact socially. Okay, that's important. Monitor, and it develop and engage in communicating with parents. This is important. Umm… we lose kids through suicide because we're not communicating enough about what we're seeing. Umm… of course, if you're not a mental health professional umm… utilize mental, mental health professionals, they know what to do in terms of, of treatment. Now there's some other things that help physical breaks, visual charts, changing tasks, set up reward incentives things we talked about bibliotherapy which is reading, you know, there's a lot of kids that are readers. You can read and some inspirational stories, economic journaling, music, artwork different ways to express yourself get your feelings out. This chart is a two slides so you'll see it on the next one is for non clinicians how to identify anxiety and depression better? Because sometimes we miss it, and it's a shame. So on the right is what does it look like in school. On the left or what are the characteristics of the symptoms. All right, so let you look at that. The more we have on the right, obviously the more we're gonna have on the left, and that's more indicative of a real true anxiety, or depressive condition, or both. One of these maybe not so much, but when you start to see clusters, we have to, we have to really be thinking about umm… looking at referring this, somebody can come in and take a look and maybe that's a school counselor, or social worker, somebody that is trained to do that. Umm… somebody becomes suicidal. I find a lot of people are terribly under trained and what to do is somebody if they're suicidal so that's why I decided to add this into the uh… seminar. Maybe you know, make it, make it easier a real, real unfortunately common cause of death among young people. So if you're a clinician, you've probably had suicidal clients. If not, you will. And if you're in a school, there are, there are students that have been suicidal or will be. And unfortunately suicides running clusters so you can see uh… you'll get copycat suicide, and suicide packs, or kids that kind of know that our glommed with each other. And it kind of, kind of will engage in this. And part of that is also trying to understand it. Umm… We don't know how many suicides are actually not intended, meaning somebody was going through the suicidal gestures, you know, putting the noose around their neck and then they, they slip and actually do end up dying or something like that because you can't come back and, and you know, ask or tell people. But, but we know people that have survived suicide attempts, a lot of them have said, "Right, when I did it I knew this was a mistake. I shouldn't have done it." You know, uh… in fact I heard uh… there was an article about a guy who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and said second he jumped off he realized a crap "I didn't wanna do this." Well, he's already dropping. When I was, I was in San Francisco, I was actually doing a, a seminar. And I went, went across the Golden Gate Bridge. And before I go across Golden Gate Bridge, there's a sign it says, "If you jump from this bridge, it will be fatal." Umm… because most people if we, if we get to 'em, hope if we can stop it, you know, almost like that last reminder, and so. Uh… let, let me talk about the warning signs of suicide. There's four basic types their situational which is a stressful or traumatic events has happened. There is depressive uh… which is changes in usual behavior signs of depression socially withdrawn, easily agitated, verbal signs, direct or indirect, they're verbally or in writing assignments, papers so somebody is writing things like suicide notes. And you know, I should, I really should add to this, social media, Facebook. Uh… somebody puts on Facebook. Hey, LA, it's been a great life, see you later. See you, see on the other side that kind of stuff that can be a suicidal comment behavioral which is like giving away possessions, writing notes, acquiring means to commit suicide, organizing business or personal matters etcetera. So look for clusters of signs. Initial warning signs of suicide include uh… serious grade problems, unaccountable changes from good to poor performance. Uh… They used to have good attendance now. They're gone a lot changes in how they interact with people and who they interact with marked changes in mood, motor activity, and speech. Generally speech is gonna become more slurred, more slow, more lethargic gonna match a depressed mood. Mark changed into physical appearance just not caring what they look like umm… repeated requests for special considerations so asking for special permission or considerations to do things uh… new or regularly occurring behavior which pushes the limits. Unusual or exaggerated emotional response immediate signs of suicide include highly disruptive behavior inability to communicate clearly, loss of contact with reality overt suicidal thoughts, and gestures, and homicidal threats. So what should we do response to suicide, concern talk with students, express your concern in a non-judgmental way, listen to the student, clarify the costs and benefits of each option, respect the students value system, don't put judgments on them, respect their value system, asked if the student is considering suicides. Often we do everything, but ask them "Are you thinking about killing yourself?" And that's the direct question that needs to be asked. We need to be very direct and explicit when talking with kids about things about suicide, and by the way that's other things too, about drugs, about drinking, about sex. We have to be direct used, use the actual words, say and what needs to be said even if it's uncomfortable. Because not saying, it's a mistake. Umm… the course wanna make referrals if this is out of your scope of practice, and you're the just the person finding out about it. Refer them to somebody that can help. Uh… the do's and don'ts. You can probably tell I like do's and don'ts list so that's why you'll see those. Uh… show that you take the students feelings seriously let them know that you wanna help, of course, listen uh… reassure them that they're gonna be better. Umm… I always wrote I work with a couple of high school girls and who are now grown women, their, their moms and one of them was joking with me. She said, "Do you remember what you used to write in my notebook all the time. And, of course, I did because I wrote it." And she goes, "I always have kept that because it's been my motto. And what I would write in their notebook is every year 'cause they had a, you know, I saw him for a long time. And they'd have these notebooks for different classes. And I'd grab their notebook from them. And I'd write, "This too shall pass." And the point of that is yes, it will be better. But we gotta wait. Tomorrow, it might be better. Next month, it might be better. You might have a better life. But if you die, you won't know. So it's very simple "This too shall pass." And so I think reminding people of that is important. Don't try to shock or challenge the student like scare them or, or you know, do something like that analyze their motives. So maybe they're trying to manipulate. If it's a suicidal behavior, it's a suicidal behavior, think of it the same as a medical issue umm… become argumentative, you know, obviously react with shock or disdained like you're disgusted that they would possibly think of that, or you think it's a sin which implies a judgment. So umm… if they think it's a sin, and that's their viewpoint. And you can value that. Uh… so what I have here is a protective plan. And this is a very detailed way to summarize and come up with a plan to protect somebody to keep them alive. You look at past attempts. If you're doing a suicide assessment, we're looking at past attempts, past hospitalizations as risk factors. We're gonna look at current uh… suicide ideation, and intense safety concerns who's supportive, who's not supportive? All right, sometimes people are on the list. They make the lists. And we have to have a discussion about that. I asked a kid one time I said, "Who do you think once you dead?" And he said, "I think, my dad wants. I think my dad would be better off if I was dead." And I said that to dad. Dad just lost it. How could he think that? Yeah, I mean, he's my son. Yeah, but I understand that's his perspective. And so we, we fixed the situation. Thank goodness. But I mean that that gets it can get to the point of being pretty desperate communication. Okay, and there's some other questions that we go through here. And then that leads to a kind of a, a protective plan like a safety plan. But for suicide, what we're gonna do? Now in my area if somebody was suicidal, they would go to the hospital that does a triage. It's a medical triage. So that's kind of why I haven't written this, this way. Blank will be responsible. So you're gonna go with, you're gonna go grandma's gonna take you to the hospital. Okay, that's gonna be plan A. Plan B is grandma can't take you. This is gonna happen. And so there's going to be a plan, this is to keep you alive. No different than if you have a medical condition. This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna use, we're gonna get you your insulin. If that doesn't work, we're gonna do this. You know, and so on and so forth so. By having a plan, you're also setting a boundary, and you're setting a you're sending a message, you're so valuable to me that I will do whatever I can humanly to keep you alive. All right, now the broad safety plan is, of course, we're gonna get the guns out of the house, right? We're gonna remove prescription medications and things like that. We're going to take away obvious ways that a person would hurt themselves. That seems obvious but sometimes people miss it. Boys commit suicide more often by firearms and hanging. Girls attempt four times more often than boys with cutting and overdosing taking pills. The number one abused drug in the United States, anybody know? Prescription medication, and most deadly or the pain, the pain medications. So we, we, we, this country loves by the way pain medication. We, we use up 80% of the world's prescription medications for pain. So there's lots of pain medication that's sitting around in cabinets. And I don't want kids having access to that stuff. And it needs to be locked up. And, and sometimes they're selling it too by the way which there's a whole other can of worms(ph), but in terms of suicidal behavior pretty dangerous. If they don't die that can cause a lot of medical problems including kidney failure, and, and liver failure, so brain damage, uh… self-harm. So moving out of suicide into self-harm, self-harm during a crisis situation that should be addressed in the safety plan. Self-harm due to a medical or developmental condition that should also be addressed in a safety plan so far head banging, biting accidental. What I'm referring to here about self-harm is called non-suicidal self-injury and NSSI. So things like, cutting, scratching, carving, self hitting, earning, picking, hitting objects, it's self tattooing, inserting objects into the skin those are non suicidal. So then it not gonna caused death but obviously their self-injury. It often caused a lot of anxiety with adults that that see this kind of thing happen seems to kind of happen in clusters too, or you get groups of kids that kind of do this stuff with each other, or, or at least in knowledge of each other. Uh… there's a new type of self-injury called digital. This involves more making fun of oneself online, so like posting anonymous things about oneself, answering those same questions to then be humiliated, to then elicit sympathy. So it's like getting wanting people to feel sorry for you and kind of this martyr(murder), martyr thing. So there's a search for sympathy for their alleged victimization. Umm… I know, I know, I hear it in my voice. And you've heard me today bash on technology, and social media for kids. But it, it's not that it's all bad, but it really is something it's kind of gotten away from us a little bit. And, and I think, we're way behind on it. Even with well-behaved kids that are getting into things that probably they shouldn't see because they're just allowed so much access to it. I… I don't think we need control everything kids do, but I do think we need to be a little bit more reasonable and present in their life to be engaged with this kind of stuff. Umm… and it's a new day, this is how people communicate. I get it. But since it is a new day, and this is how people communicate then we kind of need to embrace that and go. All right, I'm seeing this kind of stuff or my kid is seeing this kind of stuff, it's been reported now we need you dinner be. The overall approaches for an NSSI is psychosocial treatment, and you need to manage the underlying psychiatric disorders, identified triggers for self-injury, and approve family relationships, but, but what do we do in school settings? Okay, so let's get back to what can, what can the average person do? I think being distracted by journaling, drawing, or thought stopping techniques is very helpful self soothing, positive, and positive ways, relaxation, and stress management, better communication, and coping skills, self, self-harm is often a communication. So we're going all the way back to the very beginning today, what is this behavior telling me? This isn't, this isn't language, this is behavior. So let's develop, get that communication back out there so they don't have to cut to communicate. Umm… the development of positive social skills has incredible long reaching positive and imprecations. So I'm gonna repeat it, social skills is never lost. It is always going to be good. Umm… in this case for these kids for oppositional kids which we'll talk about a little bit very indicated. Umm… ADHD switching gears, umm… keep kids engaged to keep them moving. It's okay to do things standing up or wiggling around. You can't talk someone out of being hyper or impulsive. That's really important to remember. You can try but you can't do it. Use a strength-based approach, utilize their energy and ability to keep moving and keep going to perform those small chunks of work, elicit their help on activities, build opportunities to help, what we're doing here is disguising kinesthetic learning which is hands-on learning. So if they're hyper and they're bouncing around about it in the back of the class, I need them to get up here, and okay, all right, Sammy, you are the clicker guy. You're taking care of the clicker. When I snap my fingers, you're doing the clicker. All right, I got Sammy up here helping me out doing the technology thing because that's his, that's his deal. Teach systems, systems are methods of organization for a variety of skills. Systems are things that we can rely on that always teach us. McDonald's restaurant, the world's largest employer of teenagers, how do they do this? Systems, you see every McDonald's you go to. A cheeseburger is the same, the Egg McMuffin is made the same, the fries, or whatever fried the same, so a teenager can go in there, first job, within a day know exactly what to do why because every time I make the cheeseburger the same way. There is no wondering what to do. Henry Ford created the first assembly line for car production utilizing a system. All right, so a system is something that a kid could follow. Even if you're gone, see once they learn the system, it's a system that dictates what they will do. So a system could be a just a list of what to do like a mini tester. It could be a picture schedule. So we do this, we do this, we do this, right? At my school I have a system, a pictorial system for how to tie your belt. All right, pretty easy to do once you know how to do it, however pretty frustrating if you don't know how to do it, or if you forget. Or if you get a new belt that's all crispy and kind of hard to move, it doesn't work the way you did with your old belt, so I have a picture. It's about nine pictures one of the kids also made it. I didn't make it. They did a, they did a wonderful job the nine pictures of the stages to tie your belt. So kid can go up there. I don't wanna say anything dope. They can go up there look at that picture and follow it. I have another system for how to fold your suit in karate, you have a karate suit. All right, and students are expected to take care of it. And when they're not in it that it should be folded not thrown on the floor, it's a respect thing. So there's a certain way to fold it. It's pretty easy. You lay it down, your fold, fold in thirds and it looks all nice. Very hard to do if you don't know how to fold clothes and, and it's hard to remember at first but I got this poster step by step all you got to do is sit down, follow it. You don't even have to look at what you're doing, you just follow the things, right? It could be a video, it could, could be the same way. Kids with ADHD because they're impulsive, often forget like common sense things like they leave in the morning, and they've got, they've forgotten to get ready, they hadn't brushed their teeth, they didn't eat breakfast, they've got their sisters shoe on, you know, and their brothers backpack, and they're late. And every morning is a battle. Every day is a big whoop-de-doo. But what if I put their get ready for school schedule? All right, and I… and I had it where I could adjust it, grab your black shoes, you know what I mean? It's, it's cold out, grab your coat. The blue one, you know what I mean? So it's detailed, so they can look at that because if they hear me say it, it sounds like and they might hear one thing out of that out of the five things that they really need to do, especially if they're, if nobody's there, there's nobody there to ask? Right? So a visual system, you can do an auditory system. Kids with on the autism spectrum by the way to also respond to these systems visual systems respond better to objects things that you can hold like an object schedule is really cool I could do a Velcro schedule where you can actually peel it off and put it on the other side that show it's done picture schedule and then for kids that are learning to read picture with the words is good, think about driving home today. You know, you're gonna be going down the road, looking even though you don't know where you're going. You look at visuals, here's my turn. When I go to the airport, you know, I'll be looking at okay, where do I go? Where we go? And then if I can't find, if I don't have any signs, I kind of start "Oh, wait, where, where do I go? I'm gonna be late. I'm gonna be late. All right, so kids with ADHD need rules, they need parameters and guidelines. They should be clear and consistent and better yet visual, right? CPP, sorry CPP is continued positive praise. This is hit them with praise right away make it a habit so we hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em, and it's just there is no correction in there. All right, so earlier I talked about PCP, praise craig(ph) praise, and then there was PPP, praise point out the problem phrase. This is CPP. So Joey gets uh…, you know, I need Joey to go do something. So Joey, come over here please. Then the Joey gets up, thank you, nice work so bam! First behavior. All right, Joey, look at me. Good, love it. Now go back and get, I'm just making this up, go back and get the yellow folder. All right, excellent, up here, stay with me, there you go, nice job. Wow! You are on fire today, just continuing. Because if I say all right, come over here and go get the yellow folder and bring it back up to me. He forgot everything already. And if I wait to the end, I'm missing all these little levels of compliance. Now this is for somebody that's really hyper, right? Really impulsive. But if they have ADHD, then they are, right? But they can't. If they're inattentive type, they're not impulsive or hyper. Inattentive is often the missed ADHD. It means, you can't pay attention very long. All right, you got to do something that keeps their attention. Visuals are helpful. Auditory is helpful. Getting up, getting moving is helpful. But you got to be a little entertaining too. So think about umm… a little bit of break or a little bit of work. I'm sorry, a little bit of work, a little break, a little bit work, a little break. So it just little baby steps of work because their attention span is so short. And then a little break and then break could be 30 seconds. But you know, think about changing it up because the longer you go, the more you're losing 'em. All right, environmental modifications, this is easy move desks around, you know, umm… workstations of a kid with, kids that's real hyper and can't pay attention, I want them right here. They need to be right by me. I need to be constant being able to touch, and you know, come on, let's go, here we go. All right, I thought, you know, constantly engaging them. ODD, oppositional defiant disorder probably for adults, probably one of the most frustrating disorders uh… to deal with because kids with oppositional affiant are angry, spiteful, vindictive, argue, defy, and are generally just kind of miserable uh… acting kids. Umm… I find kids with ODD to be fascinatingly fun to deal with but that's me and I'm weird but uh… most adults just really this gets them. Uh… the key to working with kids with ODD is you've got to have a relationship with these kids. And nobody cares what you know. They don't care what I know. Uh… they don't care how much I know. They don't care about how it used to be back in the day, right? When you were a kid, and I know whatever. And they could care less about my credentials, my training, my awesomeness, whatever I call it. They don't care. They might care if they know I care. That's, that's the key to this whole thing. And beginning work with kids with ODD should involve building relationship, umm… unless there's clear and present safety risks, and we have to do safety stuff. But at the same time expect to be pushed away, expect them to engage in power struggles that's what they do. All right, the other seminar that I do is all about ODD, so the oppositional defiant destructive disobedient children and youth so what I'm giving you is kind of the umm… synopsis part of that, but what works for ODD. This is a, a summary list summarized by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. What they have found to be the most effective for kids with ODD, parent management programs where we're teaching parents how to manage their kids behavior. Preferably, we start when they're in preschool. If we can catch it early enough, that's where we got the best opportunity to really change the whole family cycle. So what I tell people is if you have limited funding in your communities, spend it in early childhood because that's where you're getting the most bang for your buck over time. Now obviously we wanna help kids at every stage. But I'm just saying catching it early when a kid is too is very, it's pretty darn effective. Family therapy for those of you doing in mental health, family therapy is highly indicated for kids with opposition defiant 'cause you're working with the whole system. Individual therapy can be very good. Therapy does not have to be a long drawn-out, you know, year-after-year process. In fact, that's not highly indicated. What is indicated is brief therapy and even school-based therapy where we're catching kids in school being able to check in with them, helping through their day, you know, and catch them in that way. And so, so instead of coming in at night, when they're, they wanna play or they wanna hang out with their friends. They catch them in school. Cognitive problem solving skills training which is reducing inappropriate behaviors by teaching kids how to manage stressful situations in a positive way 'cause often what they don't they only know negative. Coping skills, the two big pillars of working with kids with oppositional defiant disorder is first positive behavior support, you know, supporting positive behavior, encouraging positive behavior. The second piece which is often missing is teaching them how to manage their negative behavior, how to manage if they're feeling angry, how to manage that, and also how to think critically. In other words how to make a good decision. And then you heard me say it before I'm gonna say it again because it shows up with ODD too. Social skills how incredibly important social skills are! So they can relate more to peers and improve their behavior overall. On the bottom of this chart is, it kind of treatments for each age group, how it's broke down, so there's no hard lines on this but it's just general generalizations. For preschool aged kids, we're gonna look at treatment often who's gonna focus on parents. Okay, school age is a combination of school intervention uh… parent management training, and individual therapy. Adolescents, individual therapy pretty effective, parent management has been shown to be effective, but unsafe behaviors with adolescents have to be managed first and what that is, is when kids are running away, they're using drugs, suicidal, etceteras. We got to manage that stuff first. What happens with kids with ODD by the way? You know, ODD exists within three to 16% of the population. So it's a pretty big group. Remember, kids with trauma was 25% so ODD is kind of right behind that about 67, 70% of kids with ODD actually become un-ODD. They improve the outlook for kids with ODD is very, very good because with good treatment and good school programming that looks very good. So they become ODD, and that takes a while, you know, two to three years we look at. I mean, it's just not a poof overnight thing they've become it, it takes a while to become ODD. You know, it's like a slide into it, and that's just a slide out of it. Okay, now the other piece of good news, some kids just grow out of it. They mature. And this is part of something that I encourage part of metacognition remember that that executive function skills, I'm talking about earlier. Let me uh… utilize kind of a, an analogy that's kind of fun to think about with kids with ODD but other kids with behavior issues. Think of them as having split personality. Okay, and inside of a kid with behavior problem is a three-year-old. And the three-year-old brain wants what they want when they want it. And they don't understand a lot of adult logic. Okay, so the three-year-old wants the cookies. And you say, "No." And they say "Why?" Are they really looking for an explanation, why? No. They just want you to say yes, right? So the answer to a three-year-old when they're trying to defy our authority as adults should be because I said so. Can I have a cookie? No, you can't, sorry. Why? Because I said so. Because that's the only answer a three-year-old needs to have when they're in their three-year-old brain or if they really are three. Well, let's say the kid is 13, right. They also have because they have split personality, right? They have the, they have the adult brain that's, that's starting to emerge. The 33-year-old, or the 43-year-old, and the 43-old understands adult logic. He's starting to get it and that's the part we want to bring out in that person that's why getting them to think better, helps them understand better. So you can get them to the point where can I have a cookie, and you say, "No, I appreciate you asking though." And they say, "Well, why not?" And then you could say, "Well, because you have cookie this time at night, you won't be able to sleep or whatever it is." Whatever the reason is, they can't have a cookie. And then they go, "Oh, yeah, I forgot." You see they're starting to get it. So what we're doing is we're kind of bringing out the, the maturity piece in them which is there especially in adolescence that's the nature of adolescences is matural, maturing and, and the brain changing the body changing, and then trying to leave that little kid thing behind where you throw tantrums when you don't get, don't get what you want, right? So the, the other piece, so like I said the other piece of good news is ODD kids mature as they get older. And so we also have that on our side. So if 70% of kids with ODD and prove, what happens to the other 30%? Well, they do go on to develop what's called conduct disorder. And conduct disorders when the laws, the laws being violated that, you know, people's rights are being violated much more serious. And things that you do for chronic disorder are quite a bit different than what you do with, with other kids. If you end up with kids with conduct disorder, what they need are very serious limits? Okay, and we have to make sure that there are checks and balances in place too. Uh… for instance, so they're not bringing drugs into school that kind of thing. And they just don't have unlimited access to bring their backpack full of drugs, or, or weapons, or things like that. But also opportunities to do something besides delinquent behavior, you know, these kids are athletes, and there they are musicians, and they are artists, and they are quite smart, often it's just that they have a different lifestyle, and they've gotten and gotten themselves in trouble. So if they do go that route, we don't give up. We keep doing our, doing our work. Uh… problem solving which is part of what works for ODD, learning how to solve problems is pretty critical, this is one approach that can be used, it's called the pass approach. Pass is an acronym, problem assess strategy solution. I would use this for adolescent group. So identify your problem pretty easy, assess the situation in terms of risk, in terms of safety, could if I do this, could it kill me, could it hurt me, is it illegal? In other words, assess it and be honest. You know, now what are your, what are your options? So let's think through what are your options, and then solution? Pick what works best for you. I want this kid to have a way to solve their own problems besides just going with whatever feels good in the moment. I want them to be able to critically think. So, you know, I use this with kids that are trying to stay away from drugs, try to stay sober. And so the problem is being with your friends and their drugs. So how would they assess that situation? Well, look at the drug, is this a drug that can kill you? You know, well the obvious answer is, you know, if it's yes, and I know what I need to do. What if he can't kill you but it could hurt you, you know, or somebody else, so what if it's just illegal. All right, well, less risk but still a risk, what are your strategies? Stay there, text somebody and have them come pick you up, leave, you know, there's, there's many options, and then pick a solution. I did this with a kid not too long ago. And he was at a party. And, and he ended up leaving the party by making up some excuse and was able to get out of there before bad things happened. And so there's no good for him because he was able to make a good decision. This is a problem solving a template which is a pretty cut-and-dry. Uh… looking at the behavior, I would use this for a little younger kid. Okay, behavior, you got hit, kick, push, use bad words, spit, bite, or whatever. Okay, the results what happened next step what I'm gonna do? Okay, so it's just a way to kind of make it look a little system to compartmentalize it. This is uh… a lot more open-ended. Excuse me. First then, then my teacher was, then next time I will. So we're filling in the boxes were problems. This is after something has happened obviously. So first, it's like a setting event, then and then whatever they say, and then my teacher was, and maybe if you're the teacher, you could fill that in, if you're problem-solving with them. I was upset. I was scared for you. I was whatever. Then I sent you to the office perhaps. Okay, next time so then we go back. When that happens next time, what can we do? All right, so we're teaching them. It's a learning process from something that happened. Staff training, all right, what should we be focusing on? Main things we should focus on are keeping kids safe. Relationships are paramount for growth. Communication is the key. Maintain emotional and physical safety for adults and children, keep doing what works, change what is not working be open, and flexible work as a team, uh… and I put in this notice mostly to myself. But page 115 of the BMSG is the Behavior Management Skills Guide. It's a book that the co-authored that has a whole section on their own on a staff training so uh… different topics. What I did for our staff was I went through the school calendar. Work starts in August, school ends in May, and every month was a different topic. So we essentially had nine topics starting with building healthy relationships and that went all the way through some of these topics like this. Okay, building health relationships strong communication dynamics, conflict resolution training, restraint and seclusion practice and review. If you're doing restraint seclusion, we need to practice it. We practice on each other. Okay, and why would we do that? Because if you're hurting me, let's say you're prob, you're straining me. If you're hurting me, imagine what you're gonna do to a kid. All right, and then you can, you can point out, "Hey, wait a minute. hat about this?" Well, we've got stairs over here, or we've got, we got metal pipes over here. You know, we got to think about this and review. All right, uh… you, if you've taken CPR training, you know, that you learn how to do CPR to save somebody's life. And then you go back and get retrained because you kind of forget that stuff. And hopefully you're not doing CPR all the time. So hopefully not doing restraint and seclusion all the time, so you do forget best practice that's important to uh… to do that technical skills which is the actual hands-on skills of keeping kids safe. The technical skills might be practicing on how to assist students, assist students just moving not restraining but some students need help, you know, getting up off the floor, getting, walking down the hall, and things like that, and so how do we do that safely? Umm… also technical skills what if two students are fighting? You know, they're going after each other. How do we separate them safely? I know, I was in the hallway and two girls got in a fight, and they both grabbing each other's hair. And the whole hall is terrible. I know, good Lord, you know, so umm… those types of things are helpful to practice ahead of time. Administrator practice, and approaches, procedures very important, administrators are keeping up on things. Umm… time permitting, we've got about 10 minutes, so we don't, I don't have a lot of time. So umm… we're not gonna break up into teams and that wouldn't be functional for people that are watching online. Uh… let me ask if there's for you all here, umm… and I don't think we have any online questions, I don't think. Umm… any questions here? I've been, you've been a good audience and patient. It's been a long day. Umm… this is a new seminar. I told you that before. And uh… tomorrow, I'm gonna present it again. And then I'm going to sit back and kind of look at it and analyze it uh… to see what I should add to it, what should I take away? Umm… because it's, it's kind of the obsessive part of me. But I wanna make it as good as I can make it. It's, it's my point. And so I… you know, the seminar that I do or have been doing for last four years on oppositional defiant, I have changed, and changed, and changed, and I'm still changing it. Uh… and this one will change again. We'll probably do it again. Uh… you know, I don't know probably October maybe or November, we'll bring it back again. Uh… would anybody be willing to throw out an idea of something that they would want to add to it? nd you're not gonna hurt my feelings 'cause I'm asking you for this. So, so you can be nice about it, but if there's something you wanna want me to add, I would take that or perhaps take away. Otherwise I'm gonna assume it's just awesome the way it is! So go ahead. And I'm gonna repeat what you say so people online can hear it. 

06:14:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

06:14:45
SCOTT WALLS All right, right, and they, and they the comment is maybe more case studies perhaps even videos uh… which and I know people love videos, the problem with videos is a getting permission and not everywhere I go is, is video going to work and so it's like this high anxiety of "Oh, my gosh, today the video is going to work." Or, and then you're sitting there and you're "Oh, it's not working, and then what do I do?" And so I do part of that for myself part of that also just who would I video, and could I get permission, and what happens if they pull the permission, and just it gives me a lot of angst. But I know what you're talking about. And somebody brought up yesterday well what about people breaking up into groups and doing uh… like, I give you a case, and give you all case, and give you a case, and give you a case, and I suppose that be I could do that. And, but that takes, you know, another 20 minutes so what we, what would go out of it? I guess it confuses me a little bit, but anything else? 

06:15:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

06:16:10
SCOTT WALLS Right, so the, the comment is maybe how to engage parents a little bit more umm… for lack of a better word difficult parents sometimes maybe and, and trying to get them on board. And I know, somebody brought that up before too, how do you motivate parents to change. Uh… so I… yeah, I think it's, I think it's good I had to balance out the fact that a lot of people aren't working with parents directly, they've got their students. So yeah, that's another one that, you know, maybe, maybe be belongs in a second day or umm… little bit I'm gonna show you as a bonus section so it might, it might belong in a bonus section. Umm… other, other comments? And I appreciate these by the way. 

06:17:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

06:17:20
SCOTT WALLS Yeah, yep, so that so the common is about and, and I touched on earlier really realistic expectations for our, our students is that right, is that kind of what you're getting at, and probably setting up parameters ahead of time of what we can expect into in terms of progress. And I agree that should probably be covered. Yeah! 

06:17:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

06:18:10
SCOTT WALLS Okay, so let me see if I can summarize that because I think it's a good point. I don't know if I'm gonna say it the way you said it but umm… how to engage staff about the fact that sometimes our interventions appear to be rescuing kids with behavior issues or perhaps making it easier or even babying them, I mean would that be would that be right. Umm… remember I start laughing because it reminds me of a meeting I had once. And I had what I thought were brilliant recommendations. I really, I really worked hard on this. And I had, I even had visuals for like an idea for a schedule. And I've had the memory meeting planned, and the whole thing, and the, and the person took, took my recommendations and slid it across the table and said, "I'm not doing this my house." Well, this is great and, and so that was a, that was a tough, tough thing. So I appreciate that as well. And I don't have all the answers how do you motivate everybody. I know, I've been very good with umm… my, my approach was always get in there and help people do it. So if I say, okay, I don't want you restraining this kid anymore, I want you to use a timeout thing or I want you to use a safe room. Then I would help them do that. And I would actually show up and do it for 'em. Whereas some of my co-workers were very good at, really supporting people and kind of umm…, you know, positive behavior reinforcement with them, and I just have a ton of patience with kids I just don't have a lot of patience with adults and so that was never my, you know, thing to do. So I think you have to also utilize your strengths with that kind of thing. And where I think I work pretty good with adults. But if you're not gonna do your job, then I don't have much patience for it so. There are some people that no matter what you can have the most wonderful intervention in the world, and they're just not gonna do it. Uh… I think some of that's also which I could probably put in another bonus section stages of change that people are in, it's not something I cover in the seminar but there are different stages of change. And some people are thinking about change, some people are just not even close to it, they're not ready to think about it, some people are actively ready for ideas and change. And, of course, we love those people because they'll do anything that we say. And then sometimes we've changed so much another, another thing that I don't talk about is and I was gonna put this in here and I thought oh, this is gonna probably gonna get misunderstood, but it's a good time to talk about it is the less is more idea. Sometimes we are doing way too many things. And we've got too many cooks in the kitchen. We've got too many people involved, too many people telling the kid what to do, too many people advising the parents on what they should do, and sometimes we need to strip it down too. All right, let's use common sense. I have a case that I can tell you about real quick. Uh… this kid had lots of things going on. They were, they were on a half day, they had a paraeducator with them. They were in the timeout room every day. They were getting sent home early. Uh… they had a special recess, a special lunch, umm… and I… and I came into it did my observation as to did teacher interviews and all this stuff and, and had the idea that let's normalize this situation. We, we need to get back to. Let's get rid of all these interventions to figure out. What is our real behavior, because we don't know? We've got all these secondary and tertiary behaviors. So I came in with the plan, and I said here's what I want to happen. I want this kid going to school all day. And I wanna pull the, the paraeducator away from them, keep him in the vicinity but not right next to them. And I want this kid going to recess with all the other kids. And I wanted to go in to lunch with all the other kids. And we're going to create a normal, regular schedule. And then we're gonna wear a start-over. As if this kid is brand new to us, that's kind of the example I use. Let's say they moved from another district we'd never met them, what would we do? And this is what we did. And now you imagine everybody's, you know, they're all looking at me like, you're crazy. And I said, "Let's try it for two weeks. If it doesn't work, we'll go back to the way you're doing it." Essentially saying the way you're doing it isn't working. So what do we got to lose? Let's try it. And I said, "I will come back. And I will observe. And you can email me at any time. You can call me. And we'll problem-solve. But I said here's what's going to happen. He's going to be a happier, a better student. His parents are gonna be thrilled. And I said, "You all are gonna experience the benefit from that I won't, you will because you're at it to school, I'm not. And I wash this kid in the classroom, in fact I got confused one day. And I was watching the wrong kid because the kid I had was so well-behaved. All right, it was looking at the back of him, and I was like, "Oh, it was the wrong kid." Right? I watched him at recess. I sat with him and his little first-grade friends at lunch. He did lunch fine. I washed him in the hallway. And he was doing fine. I… his parents were thrilled because he's staying at school all day. We discontinued the use of the seclusion room, a timeout room, said it's off-limits, we're not using anymore. And did he have a few mild behavior? Sure, he did but nothing that we couldn't deal with. And the point is that by creating pulling the cooks out of the kitchen and actually normalizing, we kind of deep pathologies the situation because sometimes we are keeping kids kind of involved in behavioral interventions when we probably could back down a little bit. Umm… before I let you go, let me point out two umm… bonus sections that are yours just to have. I wanna point out the first one. This was an excerpt of a keynote presentation that I did for school professionals, and the, the end of the keynote was 15 practices schools can do to help students with mental health issues be more successful. Okay, so that is yours. The second bonus section that comes after that is called and I'll get to it here, okay, get through all these 15 things. Umm… It's called the escalated student which is looking at the crisis section that we looked at earlier but kind of in a different way. And here's the safety again, the thing I like about this is it also talks about adult behaviors that can escalate a crisis. All right, and we talked about expectations, and maybe setting the stage. This is different uh… stages of like being prepared, using positive approaches, anticipating problem behavior, catching problems early, correcting, and adjusting problems, adjusting our own expectations, identifying triggers, and then effective non-escalating strategies, and then de-escalation which it comes away at the end of that, and then stabilization and moving forward with it, with a different looking crisis cycle and actually a chart that follows that kind of breaks down responses to do under each phase. So it's a little different way of thinking about it. And hopefully that'll help those are like many presentations fit inside of them. I wanted to throw them in. And how do I get this information in there? So I said, "Well, I'll just do it as a bonus section." So I… you know, I need to let you go, I can keep talking but I don't think anybody wants to stay any longer. We, we've had a long day. I really appreciate you coming here and, and your questions, your comments, and letting me present this seminar. Hope it's been helpful. I hope you go out and do your job better because of the seminar. And in whatever you're doing that's working keep doing. And if you're not doing something, let's get rid of that one, and maybe changes it up a little bit. For those of you that are watching online, I appreciate it. I hope, I hope, it was worked out for you as well. You've got certificates to pick up those will be out there. You've got a quiz and a survey to fill out so make sure you do that. And maybe I'll see you again sometime so, thank you, appreciate it. Thank you.
