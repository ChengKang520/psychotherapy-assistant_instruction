Dr Kathryn Geldard presents a series of Lectures and Tutorials entitled COUNSELLING CHILDREN produced and directed by David Geldard Lecture 1 Joining with the child and the use of Miniature Animals 

00:00:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Hello I am Kathryn Geldard. In this series of lectures, I'll explain how we can use activities in media in conjunction with suitable counseling skills to help a child to talk about the things that are troubling them, so that they can make changes to their thinking and behavior and feel better. In this first lecture, I will discuss the initial meeting with the parents and child. I will talk about useful counseling skills when working with children and the use of miniature animals to join with the child and to help them to start to tell their story. 

00:01:25
Meeting with parents or carers 

00:01:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I'm going to begin by talking about what I do when I meet this parents or carers for the first time. I have two options, sometimes I meet with the parents on their own and at other times I meet with the parents and child together. Can you see that there are advantages and disadvantages associated with both of these choices? If in the first instance I meet with the parents without the child being present, a major advantage is that the parents can talk freely about their concerns. In some cases, if they were to do this in the presence of the child, the child might feel threatened or verbally attacked with the consequence that they might become distressed and not want to be present at the session. They would then be most unlikely to want to talk to me later. Because of this, particularly with younger children, I think that it is useful to see the parents on their own before meeting the child. This gives the parents the opportunity to talk freely, to tell me about their concerns and to let me know what their expectations of bringing their child to counseling hour. Most importantly such a meeting with the parents on their own enables me to intentionally join with the parents so that they feel valued and understood. I strongly believe that as a counselor it is important for me to be as open and honest as is possible in all counseling transactions. So in instances where I do see the parents separately before meeting the child, I tell the child when I meet with them that I have previously talked with their parents. Younger children are generally satisfied when they are told this. Knowing that I have met their parents they may be more likely to trust me believing that their parents must trust me or would not had brought them to see me. However, many older children are somewhat different. When I'm beginning the counseling process with older children, I recognize that some problems might arise. If I meet with the parents on their own without the child being present at the initial interview. Older children are likely to be suspicious once they learn that their parents have already talked with me without them being present. They're likely to wonder what their parents have told me about them and this could compromise their ability to join with me and to trust me. Having heard what I've said, you might be wondering how I decide whether to meet with the parent separately or in the company of their child for the initial meeting. Well, in making this decision wherever possible I like to fit in with the parents wishes. Usually when parents phone to make an appointment, I'll discuss the situation with them, explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the options. By doing this, I believe that I'm respectful of the parents right to look after their child's interests in the way they think is best. Whether I see the parents first on their own or see them accompanied by their child, before I start working with the child I like the parents to explain clearly to the child in my presence why they have brought the child for counseling. Otherwise the child will be puzzled about the reasons for coming to see me and may feel disloyal to their parents if they do talk with me openly. I also need to know what the parents hope will be achieved through the counseling process. I need to be honest and open in discussing with them what I believe I maybe able to do and also what I'm not willing or able to do. Throughout the counseling process I need to remember the parents agenda, because if I do not satisfy their needs they are likely to either compromise the counseling process or to stop bringing the child to counseling. 

00:06:15
Finding out background information about the problem 

00:06:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD When counseling children it is important for me to find out as much as possible about the background to the problem. The way I do this will depend on whether or not the child is present. If the child is not present at the first interview, I will invite the parents to tell me why they want me to see their child. Then I will ask them for a wide range of information. I will ask about the child's developmental history starting from the time of pregnancy. This is useful information particularly with regard to when the child achieved significant developmental milestones such as talking, walking and toilet training. I would check whether there are any genetic factors, which might relate to the child's problems. For example, imagine that the presenting problem relates to the child having high levels of anxiety. In such case, it would be useful to check whether there is a history of anxiety in the child's family. Have either of the parents suffered from high levels of anxiety and if so how do they manage their anxiety. I want to know whether the child has been subjected to any traumas, violence or unexpected changes in lifestyle. Have they moved house or school recently? Have they been hospitalized and so on? I also like to inquire about the family environment. What is the atmosphere like at home? How does a child relate to their siblings? I like to know whether the parents have the same or different parenting styles from each other. It can also be useful to find out how the parents view their relationship with each other. Clearly children will respond differently if the parental couple are in conflict compared with the parental relationship which is happy and content. Obviously, although this information is important it is sensitive and the parents may not see it as relevant. Consequently caution is required when tentatively seeking such information. As you can see it is far easier to obtain a full background history without the child being present. If the child is present at the initial interview then a different process needs to be used. Let's look at what I might do if the child is present at the first meeting. I usually start by asking the parents if they would mind if I talk to the child first. Having received their permission to do this I then engage in conversation with the child. You might notice that this is different from the process that usually occurs when children are taken to see professionals such as doctors or teachers. Usually in such situations a child remains silent while the adults do all the talking. However, by engaging the child first I'm able to join with the child to get the child's perceptions of the problem and to make it clear to the child that I am willing to listen to their point of view. I do this by using what are called circular questions. These questions come from the Milan Systemic Approach to Family Therapy. Let me give you an example, I might ask the child, if I asked your mum and dad why they have brought you to see me what do you think they might say? In response the child might say, I don't know. In this case I'll use a follow-up question and ask, if you had a guess why do you think your mum and dad brought you here? Sometimes, although not generally, the question doesn't have the desired result. In which case I'll say to the child, if I ask your mum and dad do you think they'll be able to tell me and who do you think I should ask first? If the child does talk freely about why they think they've been brought to see me, I will, if possible engage in conversation with them so that they have the opportunity to enlarge on what they have said. I will later ask the parents whether they agree with their child's perceptions. I believe it's important to help the child feel positive about coming to counseling and to feel optimistic about the outcomes. One might do this is to reframe a child's negative perceptions. For example, if a child believes he or she has been brought to counseling because they misbehave or because they are naughty, I might say, what do you mean? Their response might be, Oh! I run around a lot. And then I might say, so you are very active. Are you the most active member of the family? Positively reframing with humor and without being judgmental usually invites the child to continue to be open about why they have been brought to see me. In when the child is present I do think that it is important to try to get as much background information as possible. Consequently, if the child is present I will try to discover as much information as I can from the parents, but recognize that there will be some limitations about the types of question that I can ask in front of the child. I would defer asking questions that I don't think are appropriate to ask in the presence of the child, but will ask them at a later stage in a separate interview with the parents. 

00:12:35
Confidentiality and contracting with parents 

00:12:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD When meeting with parents for the first time it is essential to discuss the issue of confidentiality and reach a mutually acceptable contract with the parents so that they are aware of what information they can expect to receive as a result of the counseling process. Confidentiality issues present counselors with a tricky problem in working with children. Clearly, children might be reluctant to talk with counselors about some of their thoughts, beliefs, behaviors and emotions. If they think that the counselor is immediately going to tell their parents what they have disclosed. After all, as I could tell their parents what they were thinking or feeling they might not need to come to counseling. Also when parent bring their children to see a counselor they usually like to know what the child has told the counselor. Child needs confidentiality, but the parents want to know. I wonder how you would deal with this problem. My preferred way of working is to be open with the parents about the complexities of the situation. I will point out that some level of confidentiality needs to be preserved or the child will not feel free to talk about sensitive personal issues. However, I also make it clear to the parents that I understand that as parents they will need to know if important information emerges. I let the parents know that if important information emerges during the counseling session that I would tell the child that I think it is important for their parents to know what they have said. If the situation arises I will give the child a number of choices. After pointing out to the child that what they've told me is information that is important for their parents to know or that what they have told me is information that will help their parents understand more about how they are thinking or feeling, I will ask the child would you like to tell your parents what you have told me yourself or would you like to tell them with my help or I might say would you like to be present while I tell your parents or would you like me to tell your parents when you aren't there? By giving the child a number of options I make sure that the child feel as thought they have some level of control about how information is passed on. At the end of each counseling session it is important to give some feedback to the parents so that they have an understanding of how the counseling session has been used. Whenever possible and appropriate I prefer to do this with the child present so that child's trust in me is preserved. 

00:15:40
The need to use media & activity 

00:15:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I wonder if you might pause for a moment and think about when you were a child. If you like me, my guess is that there were times when things troubled you emotionally and you are unable to talk to anyone else about your worry. Was that the case for you? Many children find it especially difficult to talk to adults even their parents about things that in their view are intensely personal or sensitive and which worry them. Counseling children is different from counseling adults. When an adult comes for counseling they come with the express intention of talking about the things that are troubling them. However, it is quite different with children. Before children will talk particularly to a stranger such as a counselor, they need to be comfortable in the environment. To be doing something they find pleasant and to be given time. They are unlikely to respond to questions inviting them to talk about the things that trouble them. Consequently, when working with children we need to make use of media and activity to engage the child in a way which is nonthreatening and of interest to them. We can use the activity to help us to join with the child. Further, through the use of appropriate media or activity, together, with a relevant counseling skills, we can help the child to let us know what it is that troubles them. Sometimes they will do this directly by talking to us and at other times they may communicate with us in non-verbal ways. 

00:17:40
The psychoanalytic approach 

00:17:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD If we were to use a psychoanalytic approach to counseling children, it would be sufficient for us to use media and activity in a nondirective way. Ways to work using nondirective play were pioneered by Anna Freud and Melanie Klein. Unfortunately, there is a problem with using nondirective play and that is that the therapeutic work is likely to be lengthy. 

00:18:15
Producing change in a few sessions 

00:18:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD If we want to promote change in the child's thinking, behavior and feelings in a just a few counseling sessions we need to put into practice methods which will enable the child to talk freely with us about personal and sensitive issues. There are three things that make it possible for us to do this. 

00:18:40
1. Choose a suitable media or activity 2. Facilitate the use of that media or activity 3. Use appropriate counseling skills 

00:18:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD We need to be able to choose a suitable media or activity. We need to know how to facilitate the use of that media or activity to achieve a specific outcome or purpose. And we need to use appropriate counseling skills. By doing these things we can succeed in enabling a child to talk. My goal is generally to produce change after just a few sessions of counseling. On average I like to see a child only five or six times although sometimes I will have ten or more sessions. I do need to point out that for some problems long-term counseling is needed. For example, children with attachment disorder may need consistent counseling over many months or years. However, this series of lectures focuses on short-term counseling interventions. During the process of working with a child it is essential to make an assessment of the child's needs with regard to therapeutic work. This assessment may need to be revised as information emerges from the counseling sessions. If it emerges that long-term work is required, the parents certainly need to be informed of this and an appropriate counseling methodology needs to be employed. 

00:20:10
Counseling micro-skills 

00:20:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now I would like to spend a few minutes looking at the relevance and use of a number of counseling micro-skills when working with children in short-term interventions. Most of the skills that I will talk about will probably be familiar to you already as they are generally used when counseling adults. However, when working with children I use some of the skills a little differently. Let me briefly run through them. 

00:20:45
* Minimal responses * Reflection of content and feeling * Questions * Statements * Instructions * Observation 

00:20:45
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD The counseling skills are used most often are minimal responses and the use of silence, reflection of content and feeling, open and closed questions, statements for normalizing, accenting, affirming and giving permission, instructions and observation of mood, behavior, language, motor skills and cognition. As I've said before we need to give the child time to feel comfortable and not rushed. Whilst encouraging a child to engage in an activity or use particular media, it is appropriate to be quiet when the child is really interested in what they are doing and not to unnecessarily interrupt them. Additionally, we might use encourages to let the child know that we too are interested in what they are doing. For example, if a child is engaged in pencil and paper tasks we might say, those colors are really bright or when working with clay, the clay is a little bit hard isn't it. 

00:22:15
Use of reflection of content & feeling 

00:22:20
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Perhaps the most basic skill used by counselors is reflection which comes from Carl Rogers Client-Centered Counseling. When a client talks to us, we can if we wish reflect back to them what they've said to us. As you know, we can reflect either the content of what someone is saying or the emotional feelings or both, the content and the feelings. Just as when we're working with adults, we can use reflective skills with children provided that we do not overuse them. Let me give you one example of that why that we might use reflection with a child. Can you imagine for a moment that a child says to you, my friends are all in Bundaberg. I wish I live there now. We had to move because my dad lost his job there. We never seemed to be spend very much time anywhere now, so I've changed schools three times. You could reflect back the content of what the child has said by saying, you've lost your friends because you've moved from place to place. Notice that the reflection is not an exact repetition of what the child has said. Instead of repeating what the child has said the counselor uses their own words to reflect back the most important content in the child's statement. An alterative to reflecting back the content of what the child has said would be for the counselor to reflect back the emotional feeling that the child was expressing. In the earlier example, if the child sounded sad while taking about moving from place to place the counselor might reflect back the child's feelings by saying, you sound sad. Similarly a counselor could reflect both feeling and content by saying, you sound sad when you tell me that you lost your friends because you've left Bundaberg. When working with children there is another way that we can use reflection. We can use reflection to reflect back information related to the child's play. Consider the situation were a child might be playing in the doll's house with the doll house family. The child might pretend to be the father in the doll's house and say, I told you not to make a mess on the floor. You better clean it up. You put stuff all over the floor, you naughty boy. In this case, the counselor might reflect content and feeling by saying, that father sounds angry because of what the little boy has done. 

00:25:05
Use of questions 

00:25:10
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now let me talk about the use of questions when counseling children. As counselors we are naturally interested in knowing what the child is thinking and feeling and it is certainly an advantage for us to have this information. If we are to help the child to feel better and to make changes to their thinking and behavior. Consequently, it is very tempting for us to ask lots of questions. Now let me be clear, questions are very useful when counseling children, but we need to use them with caution. Unfortunately, it's usually unhelpful to ask too many questions. Most children are used to being asked questions by adults and often in response to a question they will tell adults what they think the adult would like to hear rather than what they themselves really think. Additionally, if you rely on asking questions, the child is likely to wait for you to ask more questions before continuing to talk instead of talking freely. I believe that the most effective way to use counseling skills when working with children is generally after asking a question to rely on the use of reflection of content or feeling or on feedback statements before asking another question. However, it can sometimes be useful to ask a particular question and then use a couple of follow-up questions. Let me give you an example. I might ask a question like this, what can you tell me about school? And then, after hearing the answer to this question, if I thought it was appropriate, follow-up by asking, can you tell me more? And depending on the answer to that question I might ask, is there anything else you can tell me? Notice that because of the reopen nature of these questions, they give the child an invitation to talk freely without being influenced by the counselor. However, I would not use these follow-up questions with the child who is reluctant to talk, instead I would focus on using media or activity to join with that child. With the exception of the use of the particular follow-up questions which I have described, my belief is that generally after asking a question it is good to wait before asking more questions and instead of asking more questions it is better to use either reflection of content or feelings or to use feedback statements. There is an additional issue with regard to asking questions and this relates to the difference between closed and open questions. Closed questions usually lead to one word answers. Imagine, if we ask the following closed question, are you frightened of your brother? The answer is likely to be either yes or no. Usually, when we ask a closed question, we get a short answer and the child doesn’t expand on that answer. Generally then, it is better to ask open questions which invite the child to talk more freely and give us more information. Rather than saying, are you frightened of your brother? I might say, how do you get along with your brother? In response to this, the child might tell me that sometimes they play happily with their brother, but at other times he is too rough and hurts them. It can be useful to practice converting closed questions to open questions. A good way to do this is to remember that open questions often begin with the words how, what and can you tell me. 

00:29:30
Use of statements 

00:29:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD There are a number of different types of statement which are really useful when working with children. However, in this lecture I will just talk about the use of feedback statements. In the next lecture, I will talk more about the use of other types of statements. I will also talk about the skill of observation. One of the most powerful ways to help a child to get in touch with their feeling and thoughts is to give the child feedback. This feedback can be related to what we have noticed them doing or we might give feedback about the way they are doing things. Alternatively, we might give the child feedback about their physical expression. The use of such feedback statements comes from Gestalt therapy. Often, when we give such feedback the child will talk to us about their accompanying thoughts or emotions. Let me give you some examples of feedback statements that I might use. I might say, I noticed that you put that animal behind all the others or I might say to a child, you seem to be finding it hard to do that or you are smiling. By feeding back what I notice in these ways the child might be able to explain to me why they are doing things the way they are or maybe able to tell me what they were thinking or feeling when they behaved the way they did. 

00:31:25
Use of instructions 

00:31:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD When we are working with children it is important for us to give the child instructions from time to time. If we don’t, they are likely to feel unsure about what they should be doing. Why they are doing it and how they should behave? They need to know what is acceptable and what is not acceptable in the counseling environment. In a later lecture, I will talk about the rules that I use when working with children. If a child is to make use of media or engage in activity in a therapeutically beneficial way, they need to be given clear instructions so that they know what to do. Later in this lecture, when I talk about working with miniature animals, you will find that I suggest using a number of instructions including some like these. Choose the animal that is most like you. Arrange the animals in a picture so that I can see what your family is like and move the fly so that it is facing the crab. These instructions are short, clear and direct so that the child knows exactly what to do. 

00:33:00
The use of miniature animals to join with the child 

00:33:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD It must be obvious that the first step in counseling children is to join with the child. For most children from the age of seven upwards, I will usually make use of miniature animals to join with the child and also to discover information about them and their family. Because this is a projective technique, it cannot be used with younger children or with children of seven or above who are not developmentally mature enough to use a projective technique. In a subsequent lecture, I will explain how to use the sandtray for joining with these children. Here are some examples of the miniature animals that I use. I use a range of animals including domestic animals, like these dogs and cats, farm animals like the pig, the cow, the horses and chicken. Wild animals like the tiger, the elephant, the monkey and the rabbit. And reptiles like these snakes, lizard and crocodile. I've birds in my collection like the cockatoo, the owl, the cranes and the duck. I have dinosaurs like this big tyrannosaurus rex. Some insects like this colorful dragon fly, and ladybug, even a great big ant and some sea creatures like this octopus and lobster, a fish and turtle. I also like to include animals that are familiar to the children that I’m working with. So, in my collection, because I live in Australia, I have a collection of native animals from Australia like the kangaroo, the wombat, the koala, and a bilby. You might notice that all of the miniature animals that I use are realistic and not caricatures of the animal. Generally they are plastic and importantly they can stand up without falling over. Usually, when I’m working with children I sit on the floor as this is less formal than sitting at a table with chairs and is likely to help the child to feel more relaxed and comfortable. I must admit that as I get older, sitting on the floor is less comfortable than it used to be. 

00:35:45
How to use the miniature animals 

00:35:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Initially, I sit down on the floor and tip the animals out of their box on to the floor like this. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I'll then invite the child to have a look at the animals. This enables me to start joining with the child. By picking up various animals and talking about them before putting them down again. For example, I might pick up this elephant, look at it and say, he looks big and strong and he looks like he is smiling. Next I will say to the child, I'd like you to choose the animal which is the most like you. 

00:36:40
I'd like you to choose the animal which is the most like you 

00:36:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Notice the words because they are important. I’d like you to choose the animal which is the most like you. Now some children will quickly choose the animal which they think is most like them whereas others will take their time and be uncertain. I make it clear that there is no hurry by saying, take your time. If I notice the child is having difficulty, I might acknowledge that it's not easy to find the right one and then I might make a suggestion such as, do you think you’re bit like this animal or this one? Occasionally, a child will be unable to choose an animal that is like themselves in which case I will probably change tactics altogether and use the sandtray instead of using miniature animals. Once the child has chosen the animal which they think is most like them, I will ask, what is this animal like? Hopefully the child will then tell me something about the animals characteristics. The child might say, this is animal is very fierce and gets very angry or this animals likes to hideaway so that people can’t see where it is. I will then follow-up by asking two more questions, these are, can you tell more and is there anything else that you can tell me? Generally, by asking these additional questions the child will tell me more about the animal's characteristics. I'd like you to notice the three questions that I asked because they are important. 

00:38:35
1. What is this animal like? 2. Can you tell me more? 3. Is there anything else that you can tell me? 

00:38:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD What is this animal like? Can you tell me more? Is there anything else that you can tell me? Some children are not developmentally advanced enough to be able to describe an animals personality characteristics, but instead would describe the animal in terms of its physical characteristics, saying for example, it's brown or it has a long tail. In this case, it is clear that I can’t use the miniature animals in the way that I would like. So I will probably introduce the child to another way of working and might use the miniature animals symbolically in the sandtray instead of using them projectively. After the child has chosen an animal for themselves, I will invite them to choose animals to represent other members of their family. After they choose each animal, I will again explore with the child what the animal is like. I need to be very careful when doing this not to use my own interpretation. I can remember, for example, a while ago I was working with a child who chose a panther to represent her father and I immediately jumped to the conclusion in my mind that the child saw her father as aggressive and frightening because that’s how I saw the panther. However, when I asked the child what the panther was like. The child told me that the panther was strong and looked after people so that they didn’t hurt. Once the child has chosen animals for all members of the family, the next step in the process is to ask the child... 

00:40:25
Can you arrange the animals in a picture so that I can see what your family is like? 

00:40:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD ...can you arrange the animals in a picture so that I can see what your family is like? Let’s look at an example. Imagine that the animals in this arrangement were set out this way by a young girl to represent her family. Let’s assume that the child chose the pony to represent herself, the lion as her mum, the chicken as dad, the fly as a baby brother, the crab as a younger sister and the gorilla as an older brother. Once the child had done this I would ask them, what can you tell me about your picture? Can you tell me more? Is there anything else you can tell me? Notice again the three questions that I asked because they are important. 

00:41:25
1. What can you tell me about your picture? 2. Can you tell me more? 3. Is there anything else you can tell me? 

00:41:30
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD What can you tell me about your picture? Can you tell me more? Is there anything else you can tell me? Next I will feedback to the child what I have noticed. I might say to the child, I noticed that the crab is a long way from the gorilla or the lion and the gorilla are together, but separate from the others. By giving feedback like this, it is likely that the child will explain to me why they have arranged the animals the way they have. Can you see how by using a statement to give the child feedback of what I have noticed that the child is likely to talk to me about what they have done. This statement shows that I’m interested and is likely to invite the child to talk more, but is less pressuring than using a question which demands an answer. Next I’ll ask the child to move particular animals. For example, I might ask the child to move the fly so that it is facing the crab. I will then check out how various animals are feeling, now that the arrangement has been changed. I might discover that the lion is worried, feeling frightened that the crab will eat the fly. But I might also discover that the crab just wants to make friends with the fly. I might also ask the child to put an animal right behind their back, like I’m doing now. I will then check out with the child how the other animals feel, now that the animal in question has been removed. For example, I might say, put the chicken behind your back and then ask how does the lion feel, now that the chicken has gone? Who is the saddest, now that the chicken has gone? Is anyone pleased that the chicken has gone? Clearly, this can provide more information about family relationships. Finally, I will ask the child to... 

00:44:05
Rearrange the animals into a new picture so that all the animals are happy and comfortable 

00:44:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD ...rearrange the animals into a new picture so that all the animals are happy and comfortable. Let’s imagine that this is the new arrangement where all the animals feel happy and comfortable. I will then tell the child what I notice about the new picture and make comment on how it is different from the original picture. I might say, that I notice that the lion and the chicken are close together and that the gorilla and pony are together next to the fly and the crab. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now that I have finished telling you about the process that I use when working with miniature animals, I think it might be useful for you if I summarize the steps in the process. 

00:45:05
1. Choose the animal which is the most like you 

00:45:05
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD First, I ask the child to choose the animal which is most like them. 

00:45:10
2. Choose animals for the rest of the family 

00:45:15
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Then, I ask the child to choose other animals for the rest of the family or social system being explored. 

00:45:25
3. Arrange the animals in a picture so that I can see what your family is like 

00:45:25
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I ask the child to arrange the animals in the picture. 

00:45:30
4. Move particular animals to new positions 

00:45:35
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I then ask the child to move particular animals to new positions. 

00:45:40
5. Put individual animals behind your back 

00:45:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD I might ask the child to put some individual animals behind their back. 

00:45:50
6. Rearrange the animals into a new picture where everybody is happy and comfortable. 

00:45:50
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD And finally, I ask the child to rearrange the animals into a new picture where everybody is happy and comfortable. Throughout the process, I will at all times talk about the animals by their animal names rather than their family names. If we use the example earlier, instead of referring to the chicken as dad I will refer to the chicken as the chicken. By doing this I help to maintain the projective nature of the exercise. This makes it safer for the child to talk about their family, because if sensitive information arises which the child is not ready to disclose, the child can always claim that they are talking about the animals and not their family. Throughout the process, I invite the child to move the animals, but I never touched them myself. This enables me to observe the way that the child moves the animals and to give feedback to the child about this if I think it is relevant. For example, if the child hesitates when asked to put two animals facing each other, I might comment on that. At the end of the process, I may ask the child, would you like to show your parents what you have been doing with the animals or would you like to keep it private? If important information has emerged which concerns the safety or well-being of the child and which the parents have a right to know, I will talk to the child about the need to share this information.

The tutorial 

00:47:40
DR. KATHRYN GELDARD Now that I've finished this lecture, I suggest that you might like to take part in the tutorial described in the lecturers tutorial manual. In order to actively participate in the tutorial, you will each need to bring with you a few miniature plastic animals. If you do this, you will have an opportunity to experience what it is like, both as a client and as a counselor when the miniature animals are used in the way I’ve described. Additionally, you may wish to use the tutorial to explore with other students, issues of confidentiality and to discuss any protocol you might use regarding passing on information to others such as parents or statutory authorities who have responsibility for child safety. I hope that this first lecture has been useful in giving you information relating to meeting the parents and the child for the first time and also in providing a guide for using miniature animals to join with the child and to learn about the child and the child’s family. I look forward to meeting you again in lecture 2 when I will talk about enabling the child to tell their story through the use of symbols in the sandtray and through storytelling.
