I AM BECAUSE WE ARE! AN AFROCENTRIC APPROACH TO GROUP WORK - A DIVERSITY COMPETENT MODEL Sherlon P. Pack-Brown, Ph.D. and Linda E. Whittington-Clark, Ph.D. Contributions By Woodrow M. Parker, Ph.D. Introduction to an Afrocentric Approach to Group Work Woodrow M. Parker, Ph.D. 

00:00:00
MAX PARKER  Diversity competent group, lead as abide by set of ethical guidelines that give direction for working with differences but in a group setting. Three statements from these principles follow; first, group counselors are aware of their own values and assumptions and how these apply in a multicultural context. Second, group counselors take steps to increase their awareness on ways that their personal reactions and feelings what members might inhibit the group process. Through an awareness of the impact of stereotyping and social discrimination such as ah, biases based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, and sexual preference. Group counselors recognize and respect differences and protect the individual rights and personal dignity of all group members. Third, group counselors are aware of the necessity to modify their techniques and interventions to fit the unique and special needs of various cultural and ethnic groups. I am Max Parker. I'd like to begin with a few words of introduction about the tape you are going to see. The ideas presented in this tape are an outgrowth of our group therapy experiences with Af, African-Americans over a period of time. Over time, we observed three things about working with African-Americans in groups that are different from working with members of the White majority. First, they see or define themselves in relation to others. We notice that their successes or failures is tied to the family or to the community. And third, we notice and observe that their problems, needs, or concerns are intertwined with, with or connected to significant others such as family, friends, and relatives and so forth. These observations, again, over time parallel some of the African principles that we'll be illustrating in this video. I am because we are, is an Afrocentric approach to group work, and is a diversity competent model that which a collectivistic view of groups a counseling is presented. In this video, we offer a cultural centered view of group that is build around African values such as unity, komoja(ph), and collective responsibility, ujima. The goal of group work is to facilitate the, the development of both, individual self-esteem and group pride. Diversity and multicultural issues such as race, ethnicity, and gender become central themes around which groups develop. Group leaders then attempt to balance the needs of individual members in the context of the group. The Afrocentric approach to group work is built on a different culture base than most traditional groups are built. Most group theories focus on helping individuals find their places in a European-American individualistic and in a person's center view of the world. You are about to see a demonstration of two opening exercises. The focus of each group exercise is on the concept of self-illustrated from Eurocentric worldview and from an Afrocentric worldview. You are about to see a demonstration where a group members are operating from a Eurocentric worldview. The opening exercise is designed to provide an opportunity for members to get to know each other. Work one-on-one to create the group and gain confidence by starting small and working toward a larger group experience. The concept of self as an individual to promote self-esteem and empowerment, which is Kujichagulia. 

00:05:20
"Self" as an Individual: Kujichagulia 

00:05:20
BARBARA CRUZ  I'm Barb Cruz and I'm Mexican-American, uhm, grew up, grew up primarily in a Mexican-American community, still live in it primarily uhm, Mexican-American community. 

00:05:35
RALPH WINEHEAD  Well, I'm Ralph Winehead, and ah, my ah, cultural heritage I guess could be classified as White-European, my ah, mother was of Polish decent, my father was of German decent, uhm, I came from a family of seven, ah, brothers and sisters. 

00:05:55
MAX PARKER  You have just seen a demonstration of group members operating from a Eurocentric worldview, what has self is perceived as an individual. Individuals are getting to know one another and the group members are growing individually. You are about to see a demonstration of group members operating from an Afrocentric worldview. The opening exercise is designed to provide an opportunity for members to interact with one another, operate as a community, and emphasize the importance of self in relation to others. In this concept, the self is a member of a community with the responsibility to promote self-esteem and empowerment, again Kujichagulia 

00:06:55
"Self- In- Relation": Kujichagulia 

00:06:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  We have found to be effective in terms of, of getting groups to begin to bond in addition to what we have just done is to ask group members to put together a puzzle. So we're gonna ask you to do that, that at this particular point in time, but as you do it, I want you to pay particular attention to yourself and the role that you're playing in putting this, this puzzle together as well as everybody else, ah, and their role, that they seem to be playing in getting this puzzle together. 

00:07:30
RALPH WINEHEAD I think this goes here. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Uh oh, that right piece isn't up(ph)(laughs) (crosstalk). 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN  I'm trying, until I straighten it up, I'm messing up some more. 

00:07:40
PEGGY SCHOLL There's (inaudible) 

00:07:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Teresa, would you share your experience with the puzzle and how you think that might play out in your being a part of this group today. 

00:07:50
TERESA BRADDY Uhm, yes, I, I think that uhm, I could see how it played out, plays out in my life and my lifestyle. And when I take I wanna test, I usually just go for it and just kinda do what I can do,- (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
TERESA BRADDY - and I will, it doesn't really matter what everybody else does, to, to stick for me. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
TERESA BRADDY And I can hear what people say and stuff, but I kinda just do my own thing and when I need help then that's when I, you know, then I might stand back. But for the most part just go for it and so I think in group uhm, how we'll relate is that I just put my whole self out there and uhm, you know, if I feel like I need strength or support, you know, then I'll might sit back and listen in and take on whatever I need to take on. But for the most part I'm just, I put myself out there because I need help that there's a task at hand. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
TERESA BRADDY Tell us about work(ph) ethic. My work ethic, ethic too. I mean, I'm, have to get goal accomplished- (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
RALPH WINEHEAD Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
TERESA BRADDY - and so it's not that uhm, I have to have too many people be a part of what, who I am because I know who I am but the added support or the added uhm, encouragement helps me uhm, continue on when I'm in as deep place that I don't understand. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  What you say, I hear it clearly that you, you went, contribute to the group as a juvenile who has failing(ph) task. 

00:09:10
TERESA BRADDY Hmm. 

00:09:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And so that's, that's one of the gifts that I perceive you're giving to us and I thank you for that. 

00:09:15
TERESA BRADDY Okay. 

00:09:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Well, yes(ph). 

00:09:20
PEGGY SCHOLL Well uhm, for me, when I'm looking at puzzle and, and how it affects hues(ph) I look at the differences, the different colors, and different sides, the different edges- (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:09:30
PEGGY SCHOLL - and then I could look back and see how they would fit together and how, you know, one complements the other and, and for me that's an important thing because I think that ah, celebrating differences is a wonderful thing. 

00:09:40
TERESA BRADDY Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
PEGGY SCHOLL  So and I, I think, in a group for me, being here and being able to, you know, get to know and to talk to and share with people who all have different backgrounds and different gifts is a nice thing it adds to me. 

00:09:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Of how your, your, your mind set is to appreciate how things fit together, and even how the colors flow together and I'm just curious where did you get those concepts from. 

00:10:15
MAX PARKER Seen a demonstration of group members operating from an Afrocentric worldview. Where self is perceive at the integral part of the collective. Operating in relation to others and inherent to the concept of I am, because we are, and we are, therefore I am. Now that you have seen samples of both the Eurocentric and the Afrocentric approaches to group counseling, answer the following process questions. 

00:10:50
PLEASE STOP TAPE What Similarities and differences do you see between the Eurocentric and Afrocentric worldviews? 

00:10:50
MAX PARKER  Specific group orientations are being generated for group work with members of variant cultural and racial background. I am because we are and the Afrocentric approach to group work is important because it outlines group stages and processes with ways to adapt traditional group methods to oppress people. Special feature of this video is that it, it is designed to help group members, group counselors rather, seek and to behave in a ethical and cultural intentioned manner. This video which is the first of a two-part series, is a practical tool designed to foster development of diversity competent group workers. Teaching therapists and other mental health professionals, including counselors, psychologists, social workers, in the use of an Afrocentric approach to group work. In this video, the inner thoughts of group leaders as they plan and prepare to offer an Afrocentric group to multicultural and diverse group members will be revealed. The video is divided into three sections where three questions are answered. 

00:12:20
Section 1: Evolution of an Afrocentric Approach to Group Counseling Sherlon P. Pack-Brown, Ph.D. and Linda E. Whittington-Clark, Ph.D. 

00:12:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Hi, I'm Linda Whittington-Clark. I'm a psychologist in private practice in Toledo, Ohio. 

00:12:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And I'm Sherlon Pack-Brown. I'm a counselor-educator at Bowling Green State University and graduate coordinator for the guidance and counseling program. 

00:12:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Thank you Max, we will answer the question, what do counselors need to do to be diversity competent? What I think we need to talk about is our developing of images of me. I think the best place to start is our life experience with 16 years of doing group work with African-American women. 

00:13:10
"That's Not My Experience." (Notice the voice of African American women intergrating race and gender) 

00:13:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Many women say that race and gender are two separate issues for them, but that's not my experience. I know that who I am includes many dimensions, uhm, I, one dimension would be my age, my socio-economic status, my religion, my educational background, and even my lifestyle orientation. 

00:13:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Yet, over and over again my race and gender contribute to my everyday life experiences. Seems like, they're inseparable. From the moment I was born to this present time, my blackness and my femaleness was my complete life experience. 

00:14:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Reality too, I know that both race and gender are influencing my life. I can cope better when I understand that both race and gender are influencing my life. I think more clearly, I feel better about who I am. I understand how race and gender are playing in to how I'm, how I'm experiencing life. 

00:14:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Yet, at sometimes I'm confused, what's that play here, my gender, my race, it really becomes an issue that I struggle with. 

00:14:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm, and yet I think both are important to us as black women. I know that when we work with the, the black women over the past 16 years, we heard over, and over and over again how both race and gender played in to their lives. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Hmm. 

00:15:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And even when we interact with each other personally or professionally, our bottom line is how race and gender are playing in to our lives. So, that's what has served us the impetus for us to think differently about how to do group work with African-American women. What we decided we would do then, was to identify an approach that's going to affirm both race and gender and we decided that an Afrocentric approach to group work might be that way. 

00:15:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  When I look at you I see myself, the interfacing of race and gender. You're about to see a demonstration of group members addressing their racial and gender issues and how these identities impact on their personal life experiences and worldviews. 

00:16:00
"That's Not My Experience." (Notice the interface of race and gender, age, and socioeconomics within a cultural context). 

00:16:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Say about uhm, the man's unmarried. 

00:16:05
RALPH WINEHEAD  Jay, you wanna go first. 

00:16:10
JAYANT THOMAS (Laughing) 

00:16:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Huh. 

00:16:10
JAYANT THOMAS Well, being a man? 

00:16:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh huh. 

00:16:15
JAYANT THOMAS Well, uhm, I guess I, I think, like as far as where I'm coming from, I cannot estimate typical male. Maybe it's from growing up uhm, ah, with my mom, well, she raised 'coz my dad passed away when I was 10. So uhm, I think, I tend to have kind of mix of them in masculine qualities and very much a nurturing person. Uhm, and I don't know if that would have mattered but I. 

00:16:45
RALPH WINEHEAD Like(ph) I imagine before, and ah, my mother was a homemaker, she stayed home and my dad worked quite a lot of hours to ah, provide for the family. And uhm, so he didn't have a lot of time to relate to the children on a personal basis. So, he ah, never went to anyone's sporting events. Uhm, I(ph) get to school, he was always working and I guess as, I was, was growing up, I, I, I looked at it as, he would come home and give orders to the, the boys and the girls on chores that needed to be done. And uhm, I always looked upon of this, he was infringing on my freedom. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
RALPH WINEHEAD  I should got running the streets instead of painting this house, you know, I should be doing this instead of cutting grass(ph). But looking back on it, these were lessons that we needed to learn. Thus, I raised my family and, and a lot about my work, in an individual type manner ah, you know, I need to achieve this to, to bring in more money or I need to do this to better our quality of life. And uhm, ah, its not until just recent that the, the feminine side of me is starting to ah, to call out. And you're right, we all have the counterpart in us. I have suppressed mine pretty good for 30 years. I can't do it any longer. (Laughs) (crosstalk). And, and you know, its a good thing because you need to, to ah, acknowledge both sides- (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:18:25
RALPH WINEHEAD - in order to understand yourself and I think understanding yourself was probably the greatest play at all, that you can achieve. It's not the job, it's not the money, it's not the material things you ah, acquire. It's getting to a point where you understand and accept yourself. 

00:18:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Of race, into this picture that we're talking about now. How, how does it change or does it change at all? 

00:18:50
MARGARET STEWART I have many problems because my father as I said, he had, had businesses and, and it was in the colony. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
MARGARET STEWART  And he had gas, I mean it wasn't a gas station, he had car wash business,- (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:19:00
MARGARET STEWART - what they call reconditioning now. 

00:19:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
MARGARET STEWART He was uhm, that we're uhm, the colony was uhm, he reconditioned cars in the colony. And it used to be a pure oil ga, pure oil gas station. (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
MARGARET STEWART And then he also acquired(ph) another building uhm, on Central. I think that's Central, with all the white tower. This is Seraqounia(ph)- (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Seraqounia(ph). 

00:19:25
MARGARET STEWART - corner. 

00:19:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK So economically you were at a different level? 

00:19:30
MARGARET STEWART Right, because we didn't. 

00:19:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And protected. 

00:19:30
MARGARET STEWART  And, and protected- (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh-huh. Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
MARGARET STEWART - because see, my father see, we would go out there into the colony and where, everyone else is in the black community. 

00:19:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh-huh. 

00:19:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
MARGARET STEWART  I didn't even know there was a black community. (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Okay. 

00:19:45
MARGARET STEWART You know what I mean? (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:19:45
MARGARET STEWART It just got kinda, because we were at, in the colony and that's where we played at. We went to the neighbors next door. 

00:19:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
MARGARET STEWART Because everyone had, had a thing they said, "Margaret, if you talk with me, you talk white." I said what do you mean? (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN Alright, I've got to (Laughs) 

00:20:00
MARGARET STEWART You know. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. (Laughs) To lose them. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN I wanna.. 

00:20:05
MARGARET STEWART Yeah, that, that's what they all, all, everyone's saw us throwing that up. You talk White. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN What was the meaning of it? 

00:20:10
MARGARET STEWART I said, I'm, I'm talking. I said if you know about English and you've been taught how to speak. 

00:20:20
JAYANT THOMAS Hmm. 

00:20:20
MARGARET STEWART But then I think it's a choice. It's a choice on how you wish to do it. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
TERESA At this very now, well, if I had a choice of my dialect. 

00:20:30
MARGARET STEWART I'll pick(ph) other choice. 

00:20:30
TERESA BRADDY No, because it just happened for me and, and people would call out my mom's house and say "Well, you ladies seen White girl?" I said, "No, that turns (Laughs)- (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
TERESA BRADDY And, and so I don't think that, I think that if there was a choice, I don't think that I would try to talk proper or because- (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
MARGARET STEWART Correct diction. 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:50
TERESA BRADDY - was not, and it's not really just diction. I think its dialect. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:55
TERESA BRADDY The way you form your words, I think that, uhm, because it's not just the English that you're speaking or how you phrased what you're talking about. I think it's how you portray what you're saying and I don't think it was a choice, I think it was my environment that kinda influenced me to start to speak the way that I speak. 

00:21:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Oh. 

00:21:10
TERESA BRADDY  So, I mean if there was a choice,- (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
MARGARET STEWART (inaudible ) 

00:21:16
TERESA BRADDY - I'm pretty sure that I would have not made those choices in those certain situations. And I do feel that I could go back and forth and, you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
MARGARET STEWART (inaudible ) 

00:21:25
TERESA BRADDY - it's my place its not the same in the sense of, I have a choice on how I speak, what I'm just speaking normally. They still feel that it's prime(ph). 

00:21:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN In clip, shows inner thoughts of- 

00:21:35
"When I look at you I see myself." 

00:21:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - group leaders debriefing and making plans for their next group. They ponder the idea of, "When I look at you, I see myself." 

00:21:40
Group Leaders Debriefing (Notice Plans for Next Group Session) 

00:21:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  One thing I've noticed in the pass few weeks is that Teresa and Margaret ah, seem to be connecting with each other. They seem to be pretty comfortable with each other even though, there are times when they don't quite understand that, that connection is being, is there. They do seem to be pretty comfortable with each other. In fact, last week Teresa even said to Margaret and implied to us that, when she looks at us, she sees herself- 

00:22:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:22:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - or when she looks at other black women she sees herself. I think we should talk about that a little bit as we prepare for the next session, 'coz that's a pretty powerful statement, for a group member to make. That's really powerful for Teresa, what do you think? 

00:22:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Well, let's look at the page 5 in our book. Let's look at that table. And let's look at the issues that we're talking about, as it relates to working with Margaret and Teresa. Table 1.1, talks about some of the issues that they're wrestling with. 

00:22:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You know, for example, the emotional vitality. 

00:22:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK When you're talking about African-American females, looking at, relating to each other on an emotional level- (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - we're very comfortable with doing that. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK While other members in the group who are from different ethnic groups, may have some difficulty as you can see, for the European-American male,- (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - he shared that some of that emotional material is very controlled. 

00:23:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And it, it demonstrates exactly what we're talking about when Teresa is addressing Margaret and being able to relate closely with her. 

00:23:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You know, I think it could seriously be a stumbling block if Teresa is trying to talk with Ralph about emotional issues. 

00:23:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Hmm. 

00:23:45
Emotions (Notice the interplay of race, gender, and age on the expression of emotions). 

00:23:45
RALPH WINEHEAD  Different way it means that, that, the hard exterior- (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Hah. 

00:23:50
RALPH WINEHEAD - that everything has to be under control or everything has to be within focus and life is telling me that ah, no, it don't have to be that way, that if you open up your eyes, you're gonna see a lot more- (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh-huh. 

00:24:00
RALPH WINEHEAD - than you ever imagine? 

00:24:05
TERESA BRADDY And that too many people, especially people that are not in my particular, I mean, if I went to, I feel African-American one of those a male and female, they would be able to accept that confrontation. 

00:24:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:24:15
TERESA BRADDY Whereas, when I'm going to meet again a European or uhm, other different races, even a Mexican, uhm, they feel intimidated. 

00:24:25
BARBARA CRUZ Because when you were talking about uhm, people defining who you are, that was part of that for a while. You know, growing up. And then we have to kinda question it and you kind of, a question that.. 

00:24:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN I had the question on that. 

00:24:40
BARBARA CRUZ Oh okay, I had the question yeah, and well they know. But that was a piece that, that wasn't my experience and, you know, that's okay. 

00:24:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Very emotional issues. 

00:24:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. And I think it's important too is Teresa looks at how she interacts with Peggy, as a European-American woman. While that gender factor is there, they connect at the gender factor. There's a racial reality in an ethnic, ah, reality that differentiates how they approach emotions, uhm, as women. Ah, women tend to be emotionally by nature. And yet, how that's played out from a cultural perspective between uhm, Teresa and Peggy, is a bit different. Peggy is a little more controlled in her expression of emotions. 

00:25:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  She now used expressing emotions, but she's a little bit more controlled than Teresa's. 

00:25:30
Emotions - Open and Controlled 

00:25:30
PEGGY SCHOLL  I think that it's a big accomplishment. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
MARGARET STEWART It is. 

00:25:35
PEGGY SCHOLL To raise a kid is a big accomplishment. To raise two is wonderful, but uhm, you know, I look at sometimes, my husband comes from that ah typical family. You know, he was raised by, mom and dad who've been married for 47 years, and they paid for his college,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Hmm. 

00:25:50
PEGGY SCHOLL - and they did all that stuff. You know, the,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
PEGGY SCHOLL - the regular and uhm, sometimes people look at you and they think of less because you didn't have that. But, I look at me and I think, wow, how, you know. Sometimes it just never seem that you're gonna get there. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
PEGGY SCHOLL And then all of a sudden you look back and think, gee whiz, look at this. I've got a son who's 23 and appreciates me, I've got a son who's 14 and thinks that I'm one of the nicest people he knows. 

00:26:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Hmm. 

00:26:15
PEGGY SCHOLL And I think that's pretty cool. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
MARGARET STEWART Very. 

00:26:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And I'm sensing your tears too, you know, when you talk about it. 

00:26:20
PEGGY SCHOLL Yes, yes. They're incredible, absolutely- (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
PEGGY SCHOLL - over flowing. 

00:26:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:26:25
PEGGY SCHOLL And so, I guess, you know, when you think about that overflowing and then I think about that spot when I was 16 and there was that big empty space and now, that, that's incredible to, to take from there. I mean, I can still picture that apartment- (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
MARGARET STEWART Great. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:40
PEGGY SCHOLL - that I lived in and I can feel that, that crevice underneath me waiting,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
PEGGY SCHOLL - you know, and now, to be here it's, it's like a miracle. It really is. 

00:26:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK It's kinda like the puzzle. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
PEGGY SCHOLL  It is. Yes. 

00:26:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Your spaces at that time were wide. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Wide. 

00:26:55
PEGGY SCHOLL  Big, Yes. 

00:27:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Now you're.. 

00:27:00
TERESA BRADDY Yes it kinda complex too. Uhm, I just think- 

00:27:05
Emotions - Emotional Vitality 

00:27:05
TERESA BRADDY - that as African-American woman, uhm, it just how my life would just, kinda, works out. It was just so clear, knowing you're finished with the drowning. It's like the outside world see it as, can see our music where are, playing together as chaotic. And its once you're able to tap into the foundations like there was a, a, a one, a level that, you know everybody tapped in to you know, someone like had been a little bit more creative, you were able to- (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
TERESA BRADDY - tap into- (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK That's right. 

00:27:35
TERESA BRADDY - the, the main foundation. And then, uhm, once I was able to be then creative, uhm, because I know that I'm always definitely out of my box, uhm, uhm, who, I guess what,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
TERESA BRADDY - society thinks I am. Uhm, I was able to take that challenge so it really doesn't matter to me uhm, what other people think as much as how I need to express who I am. And it goes on from a foundation of a rhythm with inside myself, that I'm able to play and that, not everybody can understand it and not, and it's not for me to even always ex-try(ph) to explain it because sometimes I can't explain it. Because someone might be some of those that you're probably feeling were, as you drumming(ph), I mean, it's for me. Uhm, I couldn't explain, I couldn't sit here and explain over or raise it to you but it is uhm, something that I definitely feel and can experience and can move from that and I wish that I can divide my self as an African-American woman from someone a little bit different but I, but as the saying says, we went in to my circle and tried to help them benefit with who I am and what I have to represent. 

00:28:35
PEGGY SCHOLL Hmm. 

00:28:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  So emotionally, you started getting in touch with some, even emotions that you don't have words. 

00:28:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And uhm, Teresa and Margaret,- 

00:28:45
Emotional (Impact of Age on Cultural Value) 

00:28:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - are talking, even the age difference didn't seem to matter. 

00:28:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Right. 

00:28:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK What they saw, was their common bond- (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - of race. 

00:28:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Dialogue with Margaret. 

00:29:00
TERESA BRADDY Uh hmm. 

00:29:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  And an African-American woman who is seasoned(ph)- (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
TERESA BRADDY Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - about how you define yourself and what you see your purpose as. 

00:29:10
TERESA BRADDY  Okay. I define myself as uhm, educated, nurturing, ambitious, dedicated and strong. Uhm, my purpose is to help people uhm, meet their goals I guess. It's, it's not really more of a reflection of me, but more or less a reflection, some helping someone else. Uhm, and because of some of the struggles, I think it relates back to some of the struggles that I had go through to get to this point. Uhm, you know what, to just pick, picking back to you. It's hard for me to talk to Margaret because right now I'm feeling like. Uhm, she's not the one I want to hear this. It would be someone from a different culture that I would want to express this, so it's hard coz I'm, I'm like feeling like we have a connection but that's not who I want to know who I am. 

00:30:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You know it 'coz you figured she probably already does. 

00:30:15
TERESA BRADDY I think that she. (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Because of some commonalities. 

00:30:15
TERESA BRADDY Yes, I think,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
TERESA BRADDY - in, in a sense. I, I just feel like she doesn't even need(ph) to hear it. 

00:30:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Hmm. 

00:30:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You've just seen a demonstration of the group dealing with issues of race and gender. This demonstration shows how race and gender identities interface and how they have similar yet different messages when you factor any culture. You also saw how group leaders debriefed and prepared for another group session. 

00:30:50
Section II: Group Leadership Ethics Within a Multicultural Context 

00:30:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Section 2 of this video poses the question, "How do group counselors to send the message of afrocentricity?" That is healing from a broader perspective to include social, cultural and gender issues in life realities. To answer this question, we look at two concepts. One, ethics in a multicultural context and two, three competency areas- awareness, knowledge and skills. First, you will observe a series of demonstrations of group counselors operating from a culturally-intentional and inclusive perspective as they facilitate group sessions. Then, you will observe debriefing sessions where the counselors share their inner thoughts and their inner feelings about the group and make some decisions about what to do the next time. 

00:31:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  You are about to see a demonstration of group members sharing personal values and assumptions and one group leader reacting to the group member from the perspective of the leader in her most empathic, impersonal manner. The goal is to reflect similarities and differences in assumptions and values and her co-therapist helping to bring the diversity, competence into perspective. 

00:32:25
Values and Assumptions - Similarities and Differences 

00:32:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  And yet, while we have knowing, and that's part where the group work is about charter(ph) to a ground to another level of ourselves and being comfortable with ourselves. There's a whole world out there that, that doesn't necessarily uhm, treat our group growth with favor. So, I'm sort of wondering ah, if a man has feminine(ph) heart to him and acts on that (inaudible ) younger man or more (inaudible ) man regardless of what stage in life. What happens to him when he's out there in the real world being that man? How's been your experience? 

00:33:05
JAYANT THOMAS Uhm, both qualities out in the room(ph)? I think for the most parts, getting, it's been good. 

00:33:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Good? 

00:33:10
JAYANT THOMAS  Yeah. Uhm, no, there's no major significant problems I've had- (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
JAYANT THOMAS - with either, I think sometimes though that I've experienced this with talking to other men for my background uhm, if they said, well, sometimes people think I'm gay (laughs),- (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:35
JAYANT THOMAS - uhm, and I think. (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Really misread it. 

00:33:35
JAYANT THOMAS  Yeah, it must, yeah, just because your, your nice or you know,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
JAYANT THOMAS Not uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Probably aggressive. 

00:33:45
JAYANT THOMAS Yeah, aggressive- (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:45
JAYANT THOMAS - and macho,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
JAYANT THOMAS - you know. 

00:33:50
PEGGY SCHOLL You know, I, I have to share uhm, I raised John Michael totally(ph) since he was six and then he got married and then ah, I got married and he had a dad again but uhm, he has a little bit more of that feminine side where he is ah, cared with I had people all the way up and they wouldn't say it directly to me- (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
JAYANT THOMAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
PEGGY SCHOLL - uhm, assumed that he was gay. And now, he's on California and he is ah, preparing to be married and people are surprised. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
JAYANT THOMAS Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
PEGGY SCHOLL "Oh he has a girlfriend? Oh, he's getting married?" 

00:34:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Yeah. 

00:34:20
PEGGY SCHOLL  But they just assumed because he was a gentler person- (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Right. 

00:34:25
PEGGY SCHOLL - that he was uhm, gay. 

00:34:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
PEGGY SCHOLL They did. 

00:34:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN You've just seen a demonstration of group counselors working with the group on values and assumptions. You are about to see the group counselors debriefing of the group and helping each other determine how they are going to work differently with the group around ethical principles the next time the group meets. 

00:34:50
Group Leaders Debriefing (Notice emphasis on ethics and helping) 

00:34:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Remember last group session, Linda when we were working on ah, values and you were working with Jay and how his gender and racial uhm, issues affect his life? That's what we need to begin to talk about as we get ready to go back to group with him next time. 

00:35:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  We are interested in looking at his personal perspectives and his assumptions and the values he is operating from. They seem to be different than what Teresa is experiencing even though they are of the same cultural group. 

00:35:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK The gender issue is a, an important part of this. 

00:35:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  He seems to be talking a bit about how he has some feminine characteristics in terms of his values and how that affects his life. Sometimes, people perceive him as being gay because he has that feminine side of him at play and that, though he didn't actually say, creates problems for him. He implied that it did. So that might be a place we would want to start working with him when we go back. To look at what problems, if any, ah, are being created for him as he shows his feminine side. 

00:36:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Well, he seems to be pretty comfortable though- (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - with the feminine side. He explained how his uhm, father died when he was ten- (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - and how that left him with, with being raised by his mom- (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - and he really likes that part of him- (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - and the sensitivity that is shown by his, his ah, feminine side. 

00:36:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. (inaudible ) there was though he's comfortable, he didn't meant that he experiences difficulty in the real world that some people sometimes perceive that piece of him as uhm, gay. 

00:36:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Well, the assumptions aren't necessarily offensive to him. 

00:37:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK They just are inaccurate. 

00:37:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK So, the assumption to be defined as "something other than you are," because you happen to have a different world view- (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:37:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - is the issue that ah, Jay is wrestling with. 

00:37:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. And yet, it may be a good place for us to start for the next session. 

00:37:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Just to see how comfortable he really is with that. 

00:37:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  His assumptions, the odd, external assumptions and how all of that come in to play in his life. And if there's nothing there, if he's truly comfortable with that, who are we as group counselors trying to be culturally competent and intentional to push that on him. We dont have. 

00:37:45
Group Counselors Modify Helping Techniques 

00:37:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  That leads us into the third ethical principle that we are addressing in this particular video and that is, that group counselors are aware of the necessity to modify their techniques to fit the unique needs of the various cultures and the various ethnic groups in their, their, their group work. So we may wanna talk a bit about uhm, what's ours as we prepare to go back to group and help Jay and others deal with external assumptions. 

00:38:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Definitely, Jay is very comfortable with how he lives and moves in life and there is really no need to challenge that. 

00:38:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Okay. 

00:38:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Even though he does experience the assumptions that could be connotated as, as negative. 

00:38:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. So part of what you're saying is that you're sensing some comfort in, in Jay. 

00:38:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Absolutely. 

00:38:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And if that is, if he appears comfortable, that we don't need to try and pull from him some unnecessary or potentially, what we might believe to be unreal expectations around his sexuality. 

00:39:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Right, because that would be basically functioning out of our assumptions. 

00:39:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN So, what we're gonna do is really praise him or stroke him- (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK That's right. 

00:39:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - for his comfort. 

00:39:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK That's right. 

00:39:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Okay, all right. Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You have just seen how group counselors operationalize ethics in cultural context. You're about to see group counselors in a culturally intentional and inclusive way as they demonstrate cultural competencies through awareness and knowledge. After group, you will observe counselors debriefing and sharing their inner thoughts as they prepare to continue the culturally intentional and intensive group leadership. 

00:39:55
Diversity Competence: Awareness and Knowledge Personal Awareness 

00:39:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Ethical group counselors are aware of the necessity to modify their techniques, as we said to fit the unique needs of various cultural and ethnic groups but in order to do that effectively, they must be competent in at least three areas. First, they are aware of personal attitudes, feelings and behaviors toward people who are similar to them and toward people who are different from them. 

00:40:35
Knowledge of the Population Served 

00:40:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Second, they acquire cultural knowledge about the cultural and the individual world views and life experiences of the people that comprise their group. 

00:40:45
Culturally Appropriate Group Skills 

00:40:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And third, they develop group counseling skills that are consistent with the life experiences, the values, the goals of the them, group members from their cultural as well as their individual perspective. Following are series of clips that actually reflect the characteristics of group counselors operating within the first two areas of diversity competence,- (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - awareness and knowledge. 

00:41:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  You are about to see a demonstration of group counselors facilitating a group session dealing with cultural and individual thoughts, feelings and behaviors about employment, job search and job promotions. The emphasis of the group counselors, awareness of their personal attitudes and feelings and behaviors toward the group members are similar to and different from them. The counselors work to use their awareness to modify their helping behavior to fit the needs of the cultural and ethnic group members rather than meeting their own personal, cultural needs. 

00:42:00
MARGARET STEWART  Yes. 

00:42:05
BARBARA CRUZ  As I, as I'm sitting here listening, uhm, may, maybe something that, that, that comes to mind, it's a little more recent was uhm, when I had applied for a job and maybe it's a more of a wake up call to me to maybe listen to what was, what was happening at that time. I had ah, applied for this job on this, on a certain position. It was the last day of taking applications and uhm, that it had to be submitted and so I did and this time now I found out that, well, they are already thru ah, looking into the,- (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
BARBARA CRUZ - the whole process because they already to offer the the position to, to someone else and uhm, during my conversation with the person that was interviewing me, the person said, we'll hardly know that uhm, we have been getting some pressure and we have been getting some pressure to hire a Black male, uhm, that we really needed to have some minority representation with the, you know, this, this Department." "Okay." Uhm, in other one hand I'm thinking, and, and looking at, at, at that department, "Well, yes, you know there, there are no minorities in this department and that's great that you are looking at that," but at the same time, feeling, "Hire the person that meets the qualifications and it's going to be the, the best person for this job whether if it's me or a Black male or another Hispanic female,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
BARBARA CRUZ - whoever." But when I was told then,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
BARBARA CRUZ  I mean I, I was floored(ph) 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
BARBARA CRUZ - and then, at the end of that interview, uhm, the person said to me, "Well Barb(ph), do whatever but whatever it is you have to do. 

00:44:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
BARBARA CRUZ coz I know you're in the union." I mean, I, I was just, I was taken- (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
TERESA BRADDY Yeah, a lot(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
BARBARA CRUZ - surprised, I had no idea that anything like that was gonna be said to me,- (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
MARGARET STEWART Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
BARBARA CRUZ I didn't know I was going into this position or to hire, to interview for the position. I didn't have that background information that- (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
BARBARA CRUZ - they were specifically looking uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
BARBARA CRUZ - for minority ah, specifically a Black male for the position. So, I was just totally lowered(ph) by it. Uhm, so that, that was difficult(ph). I really had to go home after that and process that uhm, with some people and went at all mad and you know, if I really did want the position, if I did want it, you know, it was there some fighting or some steps that I was- (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN That's right. 

00:44:55
BARBARA CRUZ - gonna have to take uhm, to pursue that. 

00:44:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK First thought would have been, "Well, what am I?" 

00:45:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Yeah, right. 

00:45:00
BARBARA CRUZ And they're right. 

00:45:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Are there Mexican-American? 

00:45:05
BARBARA CRUZ Well, ah. 

00:45:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Let me check. 

00:45:05
BARBARA CRUZ Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Let me check, okay. 

00:45:10
JAYANT THOMAS Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
BARBARA CRUZ Oh, definitely, definitely but it was when they were saying you know, that they were specifically looking uhm, for a Black male- (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK That reminds me of the time I went for a position at an agency. It was a social worker agency and I am a psychologist. And I interviewed with the socio-director and she had mentioned they have no African-American or minority therapist and they really are committed to adding to their staff in that department. The next day, she calls me at home and she asks me, "Do you know of any African-American social workers?" I'm like, "No, (Laughing) none unemployed." She said, "Oh, well I thought I could interview one or two for the position." I'm like, "Wow, that's nuts. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
TERESA BRADDY Nuts. 

00:46:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Call the applicant- (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
MARGARET STEWART Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK and ask her if she has a friend to apply for her job- (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
BARBARA CRUZ Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Alright. 

00:46:15
BARBARA CRUZ Yes(ph). 

00:46:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - which just makes no sense. 

00:46:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN You've just seen a demonstration of a multicultural and diverse group discussing employment issues including ethnicity, gender and race. The group counselors have, have used helping skills that are really more in line with the life experiences and the worldview of the group members than of the group leaders. Let's sit(ph) on account on a debriefing session with the counselors as they help each other with awareness of their personal values, their life experiences and the impact on group work. 

00:46:55
Group Leaders Debriefing (Notice the emphasis on helping identify personal awareness) 

00:46:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  What I'm, I'm concerned about and uh, uhm, I need your help in, in understanding whether or not this, this happened and I think group counselors need to interact with each other to, to get in touch with this reality. When you're working with people who have similar experiences to you, when you as the group leader almost say either to the group member or to yourself, "When I look at you I see myself," it have to be, I have to be real careful not to impose what I think that person needs to do to deal, deal with her, his or her issues. And there were times during the group that I felt, for example, when we were working with Barbara, I wanted her, I wanted her to become much more emotionally vital in how she addressed her issues and I need you to help me not impose that on her when we go back to group next time. (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:48:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN I need you to help me, uhm, stay in touch with her worldview and her values in terms of how she emotes and how she shows her feelings. 

00:48:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Right, because she was not ready to move when you had mentioned, "Do you wanna go further with that?" 

00:48:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And what I saw you do was you adjusted your approach. 

00:48:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  And made another offer. 

00:48:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Good. 

00:48:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Because group is about change. 

00:48:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  But you moved it into a level that is more comfortable for Barb. 

00:48:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And then she was willing to take you up on your offer. 

00:48:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Yeah, and that was hard for me to do. And so, I really had to work at it. So I need you to stay with me. Because I feel very invested in her, need to go on and show to people that, that she wants to tell nor share her pride about who she is. Uhm, I want her to, to, to be able to do that with confidence and yet, I don't wanna push me on it 'coz you know, I come across pretty strong. 

00:49:00
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And to piggyback on what you're saying, what I did was I invited her, once you made an offer that she was willing to accept, I invited her to address each member in the group. 

00:49:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And she wasn't ready- (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And she wasn't ready. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - for that either. (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Right. 

00:49:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK So, we have to watch for those cues and, and you quickly got in there and was able to work with what it was she was willing to move on. 

00:49:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You have just seen a demonstration of group counselors debriefing to assess and to ensure their effectiveness as culturally competent group leaders. 

00:49:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  You're about to see a demonstration of group counselors debriefing and assessing their knowledge about the cultural and individual values, beliefs, life experiences and world views of the multi-culture and diversement members of their group. 

00:50:00
Group Counselors Debriefing (Notice their assessment of cultural knowledge about group members). 

00:50:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Linda, I think our last session was pretty good. We got most of the members in the group talking about who they were as cultural people and how that related to them as individuals and how all that related to them in the dominant culture. In this case, the dominant culture was basically, the European-American culture. I wonder what's your thoughts are about what you heard from, let's say, Ralph and Barbara and uhm, Teresa. 

00:50:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Well, I certainly heard Ralph talking about his evolutionary process and the evolutionary process of what kind of background he came from. 

00:50:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Really struggling with the realities and the hurtfulness of that kind of thought-patterns and beliefs. 

00:51:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK It seemed as though it was throughout his whole family. 

00:51:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:51:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  And though he resisted, on some level, even though it was later in life that it actually came to full circle. He resisted thinking that way and he wanted to see himself open. He wanted to see himself as able to reach across cultural lines. 

00:51:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm, and you can see some real growth there. When I asked him about uhm, his perspective of himself as a White male, at first, he seem to struggle with that in terms of whether or not he would share that with others freely and at other times, he seems to say, "Yes, if I were in another setting, I would, I would identify myself- (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - as a white male." And talk about how that is affecting myself, you know when she shared about that ah, interview, uhm, and how that played out for him in terms of feeling okay in the midst of all of that. 

00:52:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And, I also noticed that the other group members. 

00:52:15
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - could and chose to interact with him- (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - on that level because they valued his growth, his willingness and interest in embracing some of the cultural factors of other ethnic groups. 

00:52:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm, yeah that was really exciting to see, to experience. (crosstalk) 

00:52:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK It sure was. 

00:52:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Yeah, and then my heart still goes back to, ah, Barbara as she seems to be struggling at some level uhm, with who she is as a Mexican-American in a world the dominant culture that, for whatever reason, well, actually no, she wasn't talking so much about the dominant culture, she was within our own culture- (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Our own group, yes. 

00:52:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - and how uhm, she didn't, how she was feeling so intensely. Uhm, the pain is associated with people who come from where she comes from. Expecting her to behave a particular way and not appreciating or valuing where she is. 

00:53:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK I felt myself suddenly become just like Barbara. 

00:53:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - because I knew exactly her pain,- (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
LINDA WHILLINGTON CLARK - and know that particularly in the African American community, there are differences made with skin color. 

00:53:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK And, when she said that, and she felt the powerfulness of her emotions and begin to cry. 

00:53:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK My tears came too. 

00:53:45
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  My tears came for different reasons than not being able to speak the language. 

00:53:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK But certainly not being accepted within your own safe haven group. 

00:54:00
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. And she obviously felt that because she said at some level she really connected with you, which is why she accepted the invitation to choose one person out of the group that she was gonna interact with. You were that person. 

00:54:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:54:10
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN So you are connected at some level. And then she was able to move to another level afterwards when she said, ah, I think she was sitting across from, ah, Theresa. 

00:54:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Theresa, uh hmm. 

00:54:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And felt more comfortable to share herself with Theresa. So, I thought that was very exciting in terms of her growth. Just to mention, short span of time. 

00:54:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Sure, sure. 

00:54:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Yeah. 

00:54:30
Section III: Diversity Competent Skill Development 

00:54:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  This is section number three, and the question is," How do group leaders intentionally address multi-cultural and diversity issues within group process and dynamics?" To answer this question, you will observe group counselors building on an Afrocentric theory to promote diversity. Competent skills used within a group setting. The emphasis is skill development. This sets the stage for video two, which demonstrates moving from theory to practice by following a group from beginning to end. 

00:55:30
The Afrocentric Approach to Group Work. 

00:55:30
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  The Afrocentric approach to group work - 

00:55:40
Know Thyself Culturally and Individually 

00:55:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN - empowers group members and it does so by understanding and addressing the impact of culture, of race and ethnicity on life realities in a society that is struggling with social and cultural issues. It promotes recognizing and understanding cultural realities and it provides ideas for working more inline with the life experiences of multiple and diverse cultural groups and it does so within a group setting. In order for this approach to be effective, group members need to know who they are, culturally, and who they are individually. 

00:56:25
Aware of Cultural and Individual Values 

00:56:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN They need to be aware. Of their cultural and their individual values and how these impact their life and their life experiences. This developmental process begins immediately and it underscores the work of the group from the beginning of the group to the end. For example, in group one, the following might occur. 

00:56:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  I'm curious. I wanna take it to the race piece(ph) though. 

00:56:50
TERESA BRADDY Right. 

00:56:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK You were emancipated for a particular reason- (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
TERESA BRADDY Right. 

00:56:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - as an African American female. 

00:56:55
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN All Right. 

00:56:55
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  And Peggy was emancipated for another reason as, would you say, an Irish-American? 

00:57:05
PEGGY SCHOLL Ah, yeah. I, I would say that, ah, you know, I was most certainly lived in the core section of Los Angeles, so, I don't know what you, ah, you know, what a, a nice label would be in that. But the. 

00:57:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK It's like you just don't identify them in the beginning as an Irish American, I believe. (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
PEGGY SCHOLL That was the first generation,- (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Yeah, right. (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
PEGGY SCHOLL - the first group born here. And so, that, you know, made us, uhm, we carried that, pre, pre, protégé(ph). 

00:57:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK So what's the differences in coming up in that manner, as pertains to race. And how cold, how society- (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
PEGGY SCHOLL Wait. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK - maybe labeled in. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
PEGGY SCHOLL Yeah, you know, I think that, uhm, fairly, unfairly, I was, I was thinking the four of you put people behind the sheet, and ah, you know, you just hear their voice, you, you draw a picture i n your mind, and, ah, that might be a fairer picture than what the society has put in your mind because somebody looks a certain way or dresses the certain way. And, ah, when I was young, people would see me at school and think one of them, uhm, and I'm sure it was because, you know, when they saw me, they saw uhm, I had freckles, I had brown hair and blue eyes and, uhm, looked like a normal, ah, kid. Now, I did go to school, that was a, a majority was African American in the school and ah, minority was white. But, still it had a certain label. I don't think anybody expected me to go home by myself. 

00:58:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:58:35
PEGGY SCHOLL I, I don't think that's what was expected, because I was white. 

00:58:40
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
PEGGY SCHOLL They made a natural assumptions. Ah, the assumption was that I came from a family. 

00:58:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
PEGGY SCHOLL That I had a family, that I have a mom and dad to watch over me. There were assumptions made because of what they saw when I walked through the school door. And ah, sometimes that was comforting 'coz I didn't have to answer questions but when I needed help, it made it harder because, eventually you would go through a whole worlds of explanation before you begin to get their help. 

00:59:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
PEGGY SCHOLL So. 

00:59:05
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  So some make it positive actually(ph) which they give to you. 

00:59:10
PEGGY SCHOLL Yes. 

00:59:10
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Because of your race. 

00:59:15
PEGGY SCHOLL Because of my race. 

00:59:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Uh hmm. All right. 

00:59:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Helping-related questions to cultural and individual values for group counseling. 

00:59:25
Basic Tenets Afrocentric Approach to Group Work A Theoretical Orientation to Healing 

00:59:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  There are six basic tenets of the Afrocentric Approach to group work. The first tenet is theoretical orientations to healing. 

00:59:45
Set of Social Standard and Codes of Conduct Reflecting Core Values 

00:59:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK The second tenet is a world-view philosophical orientation, set of social standards, and codes of conduct reflecting core African values. 

00:59:50
African-Centered Psychology of Spirit, Collective and Communal Self-Knowledge 

00:59:50
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Tenet number three, relies on African-centered psychology, that is, the spirit, and that spirit permeates everything. So that, everything in the universe is interconnected. Second, the collective, this is the most salient element of existence. And finally, the communal self-knowledge is the key to mental health. 

01:00:25
Therapeutic tools and Culturally Appropriate Knowledge 

01:00:25
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Provides a set of therapeutic tools and culturally appropriate knowledge to diagnose world view and reality. 

01:00:40
Identify, Appreciate and Empower (Collectively and Individually) 

01:00:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Tenet five, strives to help group members identify, appreciate and empower their collective and their individual strengths. 

01:00:50
Interventions Varied in Lifestyles, Life Experiences and Multicultural and Diverse Issues 

01:00:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Tenet number six, mandates interventions that identify and prescribe helping strategies, verified in such issues as lifestyles, life experiences and important issues faced by multicultural and diverse group members. 

01:01:20
Group Counseling: Two Worldview Perspectives The Afrocentric Worldview 

01:01:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Group Counselling, we talk about group counseling from an Afrocentric perspective, there are at least two worldview perspective that we need to take into consideration. One is the Afrocentric worldview and the other is the Eurocentric worldview. The personal foundation for these two perspectives would be, from the Afrocentric perspective, the group, that is individual concerns and needs impact on the group. From the Eurocentric perspective, the individual is the most important foundation, or is the personal foundation, and that means their individual needs and concerns are the primary focus for a group member. 

01:02:15
The Afrocentric Worldview: Collectivism Interdependence, Collective Responsibility 

01:02:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Selective thematic cultural values from the Afrocentric worldview Collectivism, now this emphasizes interdependence, a collective responsibility. 

01:02:30
The Eurocentric Worldview: Individualism, (Independence, Autonomy). 

01:02:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  The Eurocentric worldview emphasizes individualism, this independence, autonomy, and individual responsibility. 

01:02:45
The Afrocentric and Eurocentric Worldviews 

01:02:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Afrocentric worldview, past and present orientation emphasizes the here and now and more immediate gratification. Future orientation is more Eurocentric world view where delayed gratification is often acceptable and expected. Eurocentric worldview, power looks at personal existence and God's love. Value is given to elders such as professionals, or other people of an older status. 

01:03:35
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Uh hmm. 

01:03:35
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK In Eurocentric worldview, power is the ownership of goods and properties, positions and titles. 

01:03:40
No one is Homogeneous and Cultural Values Exist 

01:03:40
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  One thing we'd like you to remember about group counseling and looking at two worldview perspectives is that no one group is homogeneous and at the same time there are thematic cultural values that exist. Group counselors need to remember that these thematic cultural values are excellent helping tools. 

01:04:05
The Afrocentric Approach to Group Work: A Stage Model 

01:04:05
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN  Okay, the following table has four columns to it. 

01:04:20
Stage One-Umoja (Harmony and Unity) 

01:04:20
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN And each column addresses a particular piece of the Afrocentric approach to group work. The first column addresses the stage, the second, an Afrocentric principle, the third, a fo-, function of the principle. And the fourth column addresses a suggested technique. Stage one, we refer to stage one as the initial stage, as do many uhm, theorist around group work. In the Afrocentric model though, the principle operating there is Umoja. The function of that principle is harmony and unity. We have chosen to use the technique of a puzzle to bring forth harmony and unity in the first stage of the group process. 

01:05:15
Stage Two-Ujima (Collective work and Responsibility): Imanj (Faith): and Nia (purpose and Direction) 

01:05:15
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Stage two, the Afrocentric principle is Ujima and the function of the principle is to demonstrate collective work and responsibility. 

01:05:30
[sil.] 

01:05:30
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  Also in stage 2, Imanj is the Afrocentric principle and the function of this principle is to talk about faith and the role of faith in the participant's life. 

01:05:50
[sil.] 

01:05:50
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK  And the final element of stage two is Nia. The function of this principle is purpose and direction. We will use the technique of drumming to demonstrate the collective work and responsibility, faith and purpose. 

01:06:25
Stage Three-Kujichaqulia (Self-determination and Empowerment) 

01:06:25
SHERLON P. PACK-BROWN Stage three, commonly known as the working stage, and from the Afrocentric principle, is known as Kujichaqulia. The function of that principle is self determination, self-esteem, and empowerment. 

01:06:45
Stage Four-Kuumba (Creativity, New Reality) 

01:06:45
LINDA E. WHITTINGTON-CLARK Stage four, the final stage, determination stage. The Afrocentric principle here is Kuumba. The function of this principle is creativity and a new reality. 

01:07:05
END OF TAPE ONE 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN  I am because we are. We ponder about our beginning, our purpose, our love. Have we wandered far from our center? I am because we are. Our spirits lift when we join. Our happiness grows knowing life is interconnected. I am because we are. Knowing of our beginnings, knowing from once we emerge from the womb. I am because we are. Soaring, crying, laughing, loving, connecting. I am because we are. Spirit, soul, mind, and body. I am because we are. I am because we are. I am because we are.
