DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Hi. I'm really glad to be here, you are exactly the people that I wanna speak with. Umm… and thank you very much for the introduction and for inviting me here, but I will say that, what I want to do is just start by saying I'm coming to talk from the perspective of a human first and not an expert, okay. And I start with that, because I absolutely do exactly what all of you do, I help people and I feel like that has been the mission of my work for as long as I've been talking about Compassion Fatigue and certainly for as long as I've been helping people. Umm… I wanna start by telling you a story and this comes with the "I'm a human being first" package. So, uh… right around "911", umm… you know, we all faced these really awful events, where we were mesmerized by what was going on and very, very deeply concerned about the impact on the people who were uh… harmed directly and indirectly by these events. Now I was scheduled to go on to a plane that day, and instead people started to show up at my office and say that, you know, basically all the flights are closed down and everything is grounded. And I was doing a lot of training and then I started to uh… wind down for the day, because I wasn't gonna go anywhere, but instead of winding down, the calls started to come in from media, umm… and I wasn't going training, so I was going to studios to talk about umm… my perspective of the impact of trauma on individuals and communities. And so, as I arrived at the studio, I don't know, how many people have had this experience, but it's kind of strange, you know, you are right there, and there is this camera looking right at you and they say, you know, don't look to the right or the left, look start ahead, look into the camera or eye or whatever it is. And right on the right and left of me, were two TV screens and the twin towers were going down, the towers were going down, they kept on looping it, they kept on playing it over and over again. You know, the planes going into buildings, over and over again. And I couldn't get away from it, because I was right there, and I was talking about the issues and talking about the impact of trauma and then, when the plane started flying again, within about a week, I was booked to do across Canada, tour to talk about trauma and recovery and compassion fatigue, and all the stuff that I talked about. And so, I get on the plane, huh… and all of a sudden, I am hit with the strongest feelings of anxiety I have ever had in my entire life. And I'm on the plane going, "Oh! My God! I can't bear it", because I am woven in the exact same way that you are, that we all are. So having those images alone, talking about the issues and then being on the plane within the first week after the flights started again, it knocked me to my feet, I was just, I just could barely stand it. And so, what did I have to do, I had to do all the stuff that I tell anybody I work with, I had to do all the stuff to help myself get through those first few minutes, and remember that this is just the wiring of anxiety and stress, and when we are exposed to deeply impactful things, we cannot imagine that there will not be an impact. I was just watching the screens, I mean I was in a position where I was working with some people after the incident, I was in a position where I was talking about the issues related to the incident, but I wasn't there, okay. So being there, experiencing something directly, and being exposed to it secondarily, yeah the impact can be pretty strong and we forget it sometimes, and we let ourselves down by forgetting that more than anything we are human first. So you are all the people that show up, You are doing the good work, you are making a difference in the lives of the people around you, every day, and sometimes that's also very easy to forget the deep work that it really takes, and how important you are, and how important your well being is. But I don't forget it, because I work with individuals all over the world. who have experienced being absolutely flattened by the work that they do. You know, it's… it happens, and it happens to the best of us, and I really want to take this 2 hours to talk about not letting yourself get flattened by what you do, you are too important, and I want you to embed that, because that's probably the most important message that I have to share today. I want you to take that home, because that's about you taking care of yourself. So what I see with compassion fatigue is, that individuals can be exposed to a lot of impact in the course of their work, what I want to say is, don't worry about taking notes or anything like that, uh… Mandy, who is standing there, who is right there. She is waving. Umm… she'll be happy to provide you with a set of links uh… to anything that I talk about, and documents, if you needed and Ush(ph) is right here too, if you need any uh… information after the workshop about some of the stuff that we do, because I'm gonna talk about some of the stuff we do, because it relates to what you are all doing out there as well. So, I don't want you to worry about that. So, you've got a sense of what I think it happened to you, when you were exposed secondarily to trauma. I think this is very important because what I see is that individuals have a (inaudible ) into the work that they do. I come with my own history, I didn't come by this work umm… with uh… no sense of what it's like to experience difficult things, I think everybody who does this work has a sense. And then we carry that into our work, and then that can get ignited when we work with certain clients, it depends of the content, there are certain content, that some of us are more vulnerable to, and that depends on you, who you are, what you've been exposed to in the course of your life, right. we all know what that is. And then, we're exposed to environments, where we lack resources and we start to get depleted over time. But I have been working with individual uh… uh… professionals who help other people, since 1997. And what I have found pretty consistently is it's those people who have their own history that end up coming to see me. And uh… I think that empathy is a huge vehicle of transmission, so it's really you being able to connect with other people and be openhearted that then makes you vulnerable to the impact of the work and the exposure. So that's why I talk about compassion being a double-edged sword, because I don't think I could do the work I do, either umm… training or working individually with clients. And I've worked with a large number of clients every week and most of it is trauma based. Umm… I don't think I could do my work, unless I could be present in the room with all of me. And that means that when we are able to do that, and be present, those people that we work with, they do feel that, part of that big piece, is the connection we have with other people that makes the work possible, right? Because nobody is going to trust you, if you are not in the room with them, right? But it's being in the room with them and really being present for those stories, that creates that double-edged sword. Empathy makes it possible for us to connect. And then, it is that openheartedness, that leaves us open to the wounding potentially. So really, Figley was at the root of a lot of this and you know, he started to write about these issues in 1983. Compassion fatigue, the actual term came from a paper that was written for a nursing journal, but Figley really picked it up. Now, in 1997 I went to study with Figley, and started to write, think about compassion fatigue and develop this accelerated recovery program for compassion fatigue, both working with larger groups and individuals as well. But, you know the reality is that, we are all hard wired to remember stories. So, if comes and they tell us something, or we see something and it gets embedded in our brains, we then start repeating it to our self, that's why I was on the plane, I was in this highly charged state of anxiety, because it got woven, embedded into my nervous system, and I then started to tell myself stories about how difficult and dangerous that it was to be on that plane, when really in reality, there was nothing going on in the moment. So, we do this to keep safe, we ruminate, we tell ourselves stories… I tell you stories. And then, if I tell you a bad story, may be I'm saying, you need to watch out, umm… don't go to that ATM at night, and then you started thinking about the ATM, right? We all do this. So, from the perspective of evolutionary psychology that makes absolute, perfect sense, because it's how we keep ourselves safe, but it really works much, much better when we are running away from a saber tooth tiger, who is at one watering hole and we know to stay away from that watering hole, but when it comes to our modern world. When I keep repeating dangerous stories, over and over and over again, what I do is create a highly reactive nervous system, because it's not just the one event that upset me, now it's all the reminders and the triggers and the queues and anything that links in with that thing that I think I should be worried about. So, then I get exhausted, and we all get exhausted when things like that happen, because your mind is a story telling machine, that will terrify you. We all know what that's like, right? I certainly do. And the problem is that, we have these hormones that actually galvanize all of our resources and help us get away from danger, so adrenaline gets released in our body, and it's like umm… If you have ever seen somebody throw gasoline on a fire, that's how adrenaline works in your system, so it's like a bash! a big explosion of energy, that helps you runaway. And that's wonderful. And then it burns out. And then cortisol comes in and it keeps you activated long, long after. So if you get a lower level event, something that gets you agitated, you can have the same level of reactivity, the same big anxious feeling for a lower level event. This is really important stuff, because if this keeps happening over and over again, like it did for me with the aeroplane. I started to wire in my brain, being on this plane is dangerous. Not only dangerous but it's going to kill me, so I'm on the plane going like, "Oh! My God! I'm gripping my seat, I'm going to die here", right? Because what happens in the brain is, as we think about something, repeatedly, over and over again, it becomes hard wired like a very strong steel cable, very difficult to break. And so, we can have thoughts and believes from earlier in our life, that have been following us around forever, and it takes a lot of work to get that to disengage, because that's the way the brain helps us. But it's pretty tough stuff, so we have to think about the things we need to do to break that, I'm gonna talk about that later. So compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress and PTSD are, and interwoven terms, just keep that in mind. My trauma becomes your trauma, you clients trauma can become your trauma, these things can happen before you even recognize what's going on and it can leave you feeling very vulnerable. But as I said before, one of the things that I'm very interested in is what came before? So when a client comes to see me, if somebody calls me up and say's, you know, umm… I do some kind of helping work. And I work with a lot of uh… doctors and lawyers, and veterinarians, and emergency responders, and clinicians, therapist, and often they may call and say, you know, I am experiencing uh… helper burn out or compassion fatigue and what we do is we recognize that there are some injurious points along the way, things that they were exposed to in the course of their work. And then we peel back another layer, and we realize that underneath that is latent vulnerability. So what came before? What were the injuries that laid the foundation, for where this individual is right now? And a lot of what I'm talking about is what I want you to be thinking about as well for yourself. What came before the really strong feelings of stress? You know, either for you or somebody you know, or somebody you work with, because we all have our own stories. And some other things to be aware of in terms of compassion fatigue, is that the symptoms are the same as PTSD. I don't really differentiate that much. I just know that when I work with professionals, I want to be highly respectful, because these are people who are out there trying to help and make a difference. And sometimes have found them selves overwhelmed because of the exposure to their difficult work. So intrusion avoidance, negative beliefs and arousals, we see these things in PTSD, and we also see them in compassion fatigue. And we also see a lot of symptoms in burnout, which is that other piece of the puzzle, that we need to keep in mind, because this is the kind of impact that these things can have on your emotions, your body, how you interact with people avoiding work, feeling like somehow your relationships are not what you want them to be. And just one thing to keep in mind with burnout, that it is different than compassion fatigue as a whole, because with compassion fatigue, what I usually hear is that there was one pivotal or a serious of pivotal events at the work place that led to this unravelling. With the uh… burnout, what we are really doing is looking at umm… feeling like that there are not enough resources in your environment to be able to tolerate the demands. And it happens overtime, and in general, people stop feeling like they are achieving. So the other piece of it, that's very important is, this notion of disrespect. So if you find yourself in a work environment, and don't feel valued or feel disrespected, there is likely to be a greater sense uh… of burnout. Now this is interesting, because this is part of the reason that I often think about burnout is perceived resources. Because if one of the resources is feeling respected and valued, part of that is a, attitudinal shift in the work place, and that's a resource. A lot of people by the time I see them, they understand that they went through a long period of time without understanding what was going on for them or why they were feeling so bad, why they weren't coping or thriving. And here is just a whole list of things that we see umm… and you may notice that some of these things that I put up on this list from Showalter, 2010, looks a lot like umm… depression, anxiety disorder and PTSD all come together. People may recognize Malala. We realized the importance of our voice when we are silenced. One other things that I came to realize, when I was talking about compassion fatigue was there is this issue around silencing. And that there was some research that was done quite a few years ago with psychiatrist, who are meeting with Holocaust survivors and this was very interesting, because what the research was showing, was that the psychiatrist didn't want to hear about the Holocaust survivors stories, because they felt that the content was umm… it was either too unbelievable or not something they could tolerate hearing. I mean you people deal with this every single day, you listen to stories. You are exposed to stories that are unbelievable. But with the silencing response what happens is there is a subtle shift away from the content, the trauma content, because it is overwhelming, and that to me is a cue that something is going on, and we did some research around 1997 originally in which we looked at umm… what was happening with a bank robbery debriefers and then would be go to the bank umm… to the banks after the robbery. So, I used to do this a number of years ago. Umm… you go right in and talk to the staff and you do a debriefing and what the research showed was that compassion fatigue, feeling overwhelmed by the exposure to trauma and silencing response were related, very strongly related with a very high p, a very low p value, which was showing us that we had uh… individuals who over a large umm… scope after a while, that they started to feel overwhelmed, they stopped listening. And we looked at the assumptions, and you know, some of the assumptions I found really interesting that if we discuss it, the individual is going to be overwhelmed. I'm going to be overwhelmed. It won't help. It's too terrible to be true that links backs to some of the earlier research. And we just found that's some of the umm… most interesting things came in some of our soft conversations. People would start to change the subject, avoid the topic, give pat answers. Uh… one individual said that the way they dealt with their feelings was to fake listening, all right. Which is an amazing thing when you think of the role, that we… think Many of us have here in the room. So I want to talk about a couple of examples. Umm… I want to talk about Nancy, who is working with cancer survivors and she is umm… feeling really… like she is struggling, because she was working on one umm… with one individual, a women who was very much like her, similar age, had children and this women died. And she was just completely blown away by it. She didn't expect it, because she'd been working in the field and other people had died, I mean when you're working in cancer services this is what happens. And then, Jeffry who is in bereavement and he was helping a family after a child drowning, and he found himself feeling furious at the family. So our reactions can be so strong. And then the final one is Peter, who is a paramedic, and Peter was at an "Officer Down" call, and ended up at emergency with the officer. And initially felt okay, but then started to notice some symptoms, went to the movies and all of a sudden he had this massive panic attack and he didn't know what was going on, and he went to the emerge and they told him it was a panic attack. They ruled out everything else. And now he is humiliated and feels overwhelmed, but his symptoms had been growing, we're going to come back to Peter. With many, many people in a lot of different environments is that, we know what works. We know that when we're working to get better or stronger that there are things that help, uh… education helps, talking about it, like we‘re talking about it here today. Umm… One study with the 169 umm… educators, now this is an important study, because this was a very difficult research piece, because Mercy umm… worked in a very high conflict school district, so there were a lot of acts of violence, death, murder. I mean it was very tough place to be an educator, because you can imagine the impact on the kids and the staff, when they are many, many events. And the next one was with Flarity, Gentry, Mesnikoff, and what they found was educational programs helped them, you know, things that were helping people with specific activities, and encouraging to do this. Now what do we have a quite time, daily prayer, relaxation reading, exercise, hobbies, counseling, bla… bla… bla… we know we all this stuff right? Is there anybody here? Sorry, anybody here who wouldn't think of these things? Is this not something you already know? Right? Exercise, breath, meditate, do yoga, do stuff, right? Stop smoking, start laughing, stop hating, I mean, we know this right? But I've been talking to people since 1997, about compassion fatigue, and what I really want to know is why we fail ourselves? Because isn't that really the issue? Don't we all fail ourselves on some level? We do not do these things that we need to do, to care for ourselves. And if we can't care for ourselves, if we keep walking away, or turning our backs on ourselves, this self betrayal is the piece that then leads to this unbelievable struggle. So one of my markers, and one of the things I had to teach myself to do umm… was after a long day, and sometimes I have very long days, umm… I, you know, people call and, you know, I'm home after a long day and the phones is ringing and all sorts of stuff is going on, so… After a long day, how many people want to answer the phone? You've been, you've been at the office or doing your thing, it's been a long day, the phone's ringing you're going like huh… Pick up your hand if you really want to answer the phone after a long day. Nobody wants to answer the phone. Nobody wants to answer the phone. Okay, how many people do it anyways, right? Because, we, we all find ourselves saying yes, when what we really mean is no. And so why are we vulnerable to saying yes, when we mean no, and the yes doesn't have to necessarily be answering the phone. What I would like to do is just pause for one short break, because I want all of you in your small groups to ask you that question. I want you to ask yourself what it is, that creates this capacity to say yes, when you mean no? What it is that keeps you from doing the things you know will help you, and instead not following through? Even when you know what those things are, and we all do it and I'm guilty of this as well. So this is the conversation that is so essential to have. So, what I'm going to do is, for about 7 minutes, and I'm gonna count it, okay, I'm gonna track it, I'm gonna have you in your small groups. Just talk about that issue, and I'm going to ask you to have a spokesperson for each table. I would like to have a couple of hands from tables that would like to just tell us in briefly why is it that we are failing ourselves? Why it is we are not doing the things that we know? Why we say yes, when we mean no? Yes, so do you want to go to the podium, so people can hear you? Yes thank you. 

00:29:25
(crosstalk) 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN So we said that we don't want to disappoint anyone, that we had responsibilities, that intrinsically umm… we want to help the people, that umm… you know someone might need you. I can't even read my own writing, it's just terrible. They were conditioned to be liked, and sometimes we're ruled by guilt. And then, we condition through work every day, we spend the day helping others, and not paying attention to ourselves that just continues beyond our working hours. umm… Oh… we also said sometimes we have concerns that we give more at work than we do at home, so there is an added responsibility at home, to want to give equally to those in our personal lives as we do for those not in our professional lives. 

00:30:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Thank you, and that just fits in exactly with what I was saying before about when we wire a thought or a belief, it's like, I'm here to help, that's my job and then all the other stuff that we need to do in order to take care of ourselves, if that's really our mission in life to help other people, it goes. Another person, another table. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Come on, I did this. 

00:30:45
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Yes, come on up. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:30:55
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Yeah. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN I think for a lot of us, like our work is based around supporting people through their worst case scenario. So there can be a fear, when we come home and the phone rings that it's a worst case scenario, unless you're not being there for that. 

00:31:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY So there is no off button. That's what… then there is no off button. So when that happens, where is the place where we do get to turn off, is there ever a place, or ever a point? When we take on these roles, as helpers for other people, is there ever a place or ever a point, when we get to do that? How do we get to say no, because this is the crucial piece, right? Other groups. What did you talk about, what did you recognize about yourself, because we all do this piece, what did you understand? What is your technique? How do you get out of it? Yeah. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN I'm gonna stand here. 

00:32:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN We talked about a lot of times, a lot of us go to the, go to person, right? And forgetting that they go to person may uh… feel compassion fatigue, first responders, umm… sometimes there is a bravado that they are immune to compassion fatigue, they're supposed to be the helpers and the fixers, so they won't recognize that in themselves. Don't want to let others down, umm… we know that when someone needs us more than we need down time. And when we have responded we always feel good, when we come back and that's addictive, and this is what you signed for, and people won't understand no. 

00:32:45
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY You're saying all the stuff that I hear when I work with individuals, who are already at the point where they are so depleted by their work, and we actually have to change this. And this is a huge challenge, because as helpers whatever your role is and I have worked with a lot of different helpers, umm… it's easy to get into that state where you really believe that you must always say yes. I did a re… research recently on compassion fatigue, now when I started in the field they were like, you know, I don't know, 6 or 7 articles on compassion fatigue and now when I did a Google search they were 713,000 accurate hits, which means people are talking about this issue, they're thinking about this issue, they're writing about it, and they are feeling it. The things that I've discovered over the last 15 years in working with a lot of individuals, studying the material, looking a little bit more closely is, there are a number of things that stand out for me. One is everybody in this field is an overcoper to some degree. We're all the people who show up, and we are willing to tolerate overwork for perfection. We are willing to impact ourselves, if it means that somebody else gets helped. We may have chronic low self compassion, which I will talk about umm… and we may have been exposed to severe trauma in our work place and likely in our personal lives. Umm… We may have a large case loads that are complex, and have insufficient training. We don't necessarily have trauma informed care training, we may identify with the victims. How can you not identify with victims? We are people. We relate to people, we went into a field helping people? So it makes perfect sense. We're already emphatic human beings. We may lack support in our work place, umm… and we are at greater risk when we are younger and have less experience in our work or umm… tend towards wishful thinking or suppression, but there are lot of buffers, and I want to talk about those as well. So the overcopers, I wrote an article umm… in 2013 that went into uh… a book on physicians, who were needing to look at themselves. And this is a huge issue, because there are some very serious things that we‘re seeing with the medical profession umm… that there is a tendency to tolerate umm… large amounts of stress and strain in order to get the job done. And so at a certain point there has to be a sea change in how we handle these things if we're not to lose the best and the brightest. But even more important than that is that when we walk down this road of helping others, and we start to take on a mantle of, I just have to keep on going, which is what a lot of us do, we stop deeply understanding that our self reflection means ongoing growth and understanding both and how to care for the people around us, but also just being present of what is happening. And when we are really present with what is happening in our work, we do tend to get better results. So there was this trend in the physicians umm… where there was a either umm… one way or the other, there was gonna be reflection, and so, you were getting better results, and people who were staying connected and able to do their work, or there was a shutting down and this is not different in a lot of professions. Umm… In 2007, Marine found that 10% of occupational disease were due to stress claims, and compassion fatigue is stress related. Now, I love this, because people are aware of this idea of self compassion. How many people are familiar with self compassion? This phrase, this term could you pick up your hands? It's very slowly coming into uh… awareness, but this idea of self compassion is really being as compassionate with ourselves, as we are with the people that we serve, and it makes perfect sense, right? Now, what the research that Neff was looking at, found is that people who had low self compassion had higher anxiety, depression, and symptoms of stress or PTSD, right? It's important for us to recognize, there is a piece about, how we care or how we treat ourselves, and I'm gonna work with you on some exercises shortly. So we also need to recognize that when we are exposed to trauma, and remember exposure to trauma can happen when you sit and you have a very deep conversation with somebody who's just lost a loved one in a terrible accident or you've witnessed something, being close can happen in a lot of different ways. So recognizing that, that is the case as important in your personal experience as well. What came before? I talked about that that is one of the biggest things that I look at in every case. So the closer you are the incident, whether that means the conversation and how deeply the person shared with you or being on the ground when something was really happening in the moment and your own history of trauma. And I talked about this, when you're overwhelmed with job demands and showing signs of burnout, workers were found to be at greater risk of compassion fatigue. This is something that I think is so important, because what we're really looking at here is this idea that, when we are not allowing the dialogue and the working through of trauma, and this means that you have to be a trauma informed practitioner, that there seems to be higher incident of compassion fatigue and burnout. And this is really all about learning. What happens with somebody when they've experienced a trauma? What does resolution look like? Do people really recover? Because sometimes we could feel like they never will and they cannot. We can identify with individuals who've experienced significant events, because we are wired to do that. And some of us are really powerfully wired. So when we have that conversation or that interaction and somebody is telling us the worst thing that has ever happened to them, it's hard not to take that in. We're wired with something called mirror neurons. How many people here are familiar with the term mirror neurons? Great. Okay. I wanted you to know about this. In the 1990s in Parma Italy, they were doing some research. They were hooking up these monkeys with these machines and they were tracking the areas of the brain that became stimulated. Now this is important, because what happened was, so the monkeys are hooked up and they're opening up peanuts. And as they're opening up peanuts, their brains are lighting up in very specific places. Then the monkeys are still hooked up. One of researchers comes into the lab, the monkeys watching the researcher, the researcher opens up the peanut and the same brain areas that they saw the monkeys brains light up when they open the peanuts were now lighting up again. So that means that just watching somebody go through the motions of something, lights up the same areas of your brain, that doing the thing yourself. And that is significant, because if you're talking to somebody who's experienced a massive trauma and they're sharing their grief and their suffering with you, your brain will be lighting up with much of the same patterning, which means, we don't get to show up in our work, and not have it impact us. There's no way to do it. This is what it is. So, psychotherapists who work with chronically ill patients, disregard their own self needs. It's really interesting, because these are the folks that need to take care of themselves. It's easy to look at them and say, of course you need to take care of themselves, but there's a piece about what all of you said, you know, when we show up, you know, we keep on answering the phone, because it's hard not to, because we believe that we have to keep showing up for those people, because they're suffering so much. And we can feel their suffering. So the mirror neurons fire both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action, So take that in, because I want you to be able to recognize that we're wired in some ways to not notice our own pain and suffering, because we're so focussed on somebody else's. Lack of support is hugely an issue, because sometimes when we're really good at helping others, we don't really create the network around us that we need to in order to take care of ourselves. And this is an interesting story, so here is a fire-fighter, who goes into a building and he brings out a young child and the building is on fire. He brings out a young child and the child's okay, taken the child off by ambulance. He goes back in the building, several more times and then he's sitting down and one of his colleagues comes up to him and says, I'm so glad you're finally sitting and he says, "What do you mean finally sitting? I only went in the building once". He says "No! You were in there five or six times, you have got to stop". And he is just astonished, because he could only remember going in the one time, taking out the child and he doesn't remember anything else, after that. That is peritraumatic dissociation. Our brains can ignite to the point, where we have lapses of thought and memory. And that is not an unusual thing when you experience stress at a certain level. So when we're exposed to extreme stress, we can lose pieces. So wishful thinking, suppressed umm… suppressed emotions and external locus of control, and external locus of control is kind of when I know that, you know, the outcome of something… somebody else gets to decide that. I don't have control over that. And what we need to recognize is these are also risk factors for compassion fatigue. But there are lots of buffers, self-care, social support, cognitive mastery that's bringing meaning to your life and then things that happen in your life. So this is my confession as a trauma therapist, I've been doing trauma work for loads of years, uh… more than 15 years and I'm not going to date myself now. Umm… and what keeps me going? Well, I just want to say that I love my work. I find that I was a good fit for the work that I do and the care that I do with trauma survivors. And I run this organization helping clinicians and emergency responders and other people in communities, help trauma survivors , but honestly I am absolutely dedicated to ensuring that I care for myself, because I do not have the luxury to not do that. I have learned and this is hard-earned that I, I simply, have exactly the same nervous system as any of the trauma survivors that I worked with directly. I cannot cheap out on myself. And I don't want you to do that either. So, one of the things that I do in my role uh… running the traumatology institute is I get these genograms. I have this online portal and we have people training with us from all over the world. I think about 42 different countries now. It's very interesting, because I could get a umm… a student report from umm… Hawaii or from Dubai or from North York or anywhere in the world. It's very interesting. And what happens is we have two different streams in our training, one is this community and work place stream and these are people who work in shelters or our emergency workers, they do lots of different things in the communities to help. And the other stream are clinical stream, therapist umm… people who are mental healthcare providers and they umm… both of them have to submit these uh… genograms, which are kind of charts that show, you know, the family of origin, either of themselves or their family or sorry, a family of somebody that they're working with or a friend or, you know, whoever is willing to do this little exercise with them. So, about 75% choose to do their own family of origin. I find that in itself very interesting, because they're sending it through to me, a person they've never met umm… from anywhere in the world. And so, I get these umm… documents with all this history. Of the 75% of the people who are sending me their genograms, how many people do you think have significant trauma? Any guess? So, how much? 100. 100%. It is astonishing, because what ends up happening is I see these traumagrams from people all over the world and I don't think they're different than anybody in this room or care givers in general. And so, the implications are enormous, because these people are sending me traumagrams. And so, this is what I said to you before, if we have something that is underlying, it makes us more vulnerable. So this is kind of what a traumagram looks like, and you can see all this jagged lines and the of a lightning rods where the trauma is and here's the individual who's sending me in the traumagram, so there's lots of history. People must be aware that as we are exposed to trauma in our own life, it lays a foundation to our own vulnerability later. The adverse childhood experiences umm… research is pivotal. And what they found was that when you had four or more incidents in your childhood of adverse experiences, you were highly at risk of experiencing uh… make a health sorry, mental health or substance abuse problems and physical problems as well, because we know that ongoing stress can have an impact on our study, it's pretty severe. Recent research on descendants of Holocaust survivors in 2015 showed that if you had a person umm… who would experience something, very severe during the Holocaust or offspring were more at risk of a stress disorder as well. I think this is what I'm seeing in my student sample. It's reverting to me that so many of them going into the field, helping trauma survivors. People, who want to help and make a difference themselves have a history that leads to this vulnerability. I'm not, I'm not different by the way, I have way more than four, in my A score, which means as I said, I cannot leave it as a luxury item to take care of myself. I simply can't do that. I can do my work otherwise. How you respond paves the route. So I think there are number of different blind spots. Well, I think there are more than the ones that I identified in this I'm going to show you the eight that I have selected, but the reality is I think there are many, many. I like the ones that I chose. And I want to challenge you to think about what's your blind spots are as well. And what keeps you from talking care of yourself, because really the reality is that, there was lots of things that we can do to ourselves that trick us. So I'm just gonna go through them all. Poor Alice, she's very hungry, but she's never nursed. She's probably, you know, struggling and I don't know how many people have read through the looking glass, which is sequel to Alice in Wonderland, but there's a beautiful piece in it, in which the red queen takes Alice for this run. And she runs and she runs, and she runs. And finally they stop and Alice is like totally exhausted and she says that, you know, it seems like they're in the same place. And the red queen says well, it takes all the running you can, just to keep in the same place in this land, that's really unbelievable. So after Alice is exhausted, the red queen wants to give her a dry biscuit to nourish her. Now, she doesn't want a dry biscuit, she's thirsty. She's, She's absolutely famish for some liquid, refreshment, but she takes the biscuit, because she wants to be nice. And she eats it, and so she's now choking on the dry biscuit, because it's absolutely not what she needs or wants. And don't we do that? My, My mom came to Canada as an immigrant and my parents didn't have any money, so you know, they just tried to do the best they could. She didn't speak English, and so, you know, she was just trying to do what anybody does when they're trying to survive. So she wanted to learn how to speak English. And sometimes we have to look for the right nourishment. So her right nourishment was reading comic books, because she learned to speak English and read English, reading comic books. So I'm saying it doesn't have to be complicated or perfect. We just have to figure out what's the thing that will nourish us. What's the thing that we're actually hungry for? Now there's some beautiful research on "Awe". And "Awe" is like this thing that we all have experienced at some point in our lives, these precious moments. How many people by the way in this room feel time pressures, just pick up your hand if you feel that time is a pressure for you? That you don't quite get everything done that you know, you feel that, you know, it's a demand on you, right? Okay. So there is a tendency and many people feel this, this was a research study of 1000 and 47% feet time-pressured, like there's not enough time to get everything done. Oh my God! The new research on "Awe" looked at a marker called Interleukin 6. And they just were able to capture this by spit. And what interleukin 6 is, it's a marker that will show, if there's inflammation and that is associated with stress in the body. And so, they were capturing interleukin 6 with people who were in umm… groups of people who were exposed to content that was "Awe" inspiring. And what they saw was that people who were exposed to "Awe", had lower markers of stress. So this is a really, really good reason to indulge ourselves in "Awe." And so, there is this really wonderful video of group of people who are umm… helping these 30 stranded dolphins, go back out to sea. And you can see them running into the waves and pulling the dolphins out. It's just profound, because what ends up happening when we're exposed to this "Awe," is not only does it help us with lowering uh… the inflammation in our body and lowering stress, but it makes us feel less time pressured, and it makes us feel more able to easily give. So, I wanted actually encourage you to indulge yourself for a moment in Awe and I'm going to tell you a very short Awe story and then I'm going to ask you to talk with somebody in your group that you're sitting beside uh… in either 2s or 3s. I'm not going to give you a lot of time for this, but I want you to just capture, rehearsing Awe. So, my Awe story is this and it fits very well, because I was in Hawaii and this was one of my bucket-list things. And I went to the Nā Pali Coast and it was gorgeous, it was unbelievable and this is actually a picture of the Nā Pali Coast. So I was on a seven hour hike. So it was an endurance hike. Yeah, to be out there and really kind of taking it all in and as we're hiking along, I'm just inspired by everything around me, to the point where, when I fell and I got back up about an hour into the trail. And I walked for the next six hours and by the time we were about a half an hour to an hour to the end of the trail, I noticed my hands started to really, really hurt. Now I didn't know it at that time, but broken my hand, umm… but the awe, I mean, when I think about it in terms of this research and inflammation in the body. I didn't feel the level of pain until I was almost out of the trail 7 hours later. It tells us something about what we need to do to tend to ourselves, and I want you to just spend a few moments turn to somebody, I'm going to give you just a few moments to think about one thing that you loved or felt was an inspiring experience and just tell the person sitting beside you what it was and then let the person tell you what it was. So this is a four minute exercise, you'll have about 2 minutes to find and share and then 2 minutes for your partner to share. And then bring your attention back into the room and let's talk about how awe conserve you and just letting yourself use this as an exercise for rehearsing something that you can use to reinforce the positive. You can do something like this at anytime, if you've got your awe stories or even an awe partner at work, somebody who you can relate to and share these things, e specially if you're having a tough day. Go in search of your awe story and ask yourself if you're not using awe, is this a place that you betrayed yourself. Commander Jack. Okay, so here's a guy, who is really all about wanting to help other people. He's as post military. He's in a subway car. And he sees one of the passengers in the car is really struggling, starting to get agitated, upset, angry and he's starting to sware and people around him are starting to shift and move around and move away, except for one women, who walks up to the individual and in a very gentle way, engages this individual with kindness and compassion. Now, our friend Jack had all sorts of ideas in his mind about how he wanted to intervene and wrestle him to the ground. But what ended up happening in front of his eyes was that he saw that this approach of kindness and compassion was by far more powerful than anything he could've done. It's not the Absence of Compassion that creates problems it's what Compassion is replaced with. Now, we know that if you're exposed to stress for a long period of time, eventually the body starts to break down. It won't take it after a certain amount of time and Selye did a lot of research on this and, you know, consistently found that animals exposed to stress over a long period of time started to get sick. Now we all have this wiring, Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Nervous System and one regulates our rest and digest and the other is all about fight/flight and when we get into that Fight/Flight and it turns on, it's like we're really on. And the interesting thing about Fight/Flight is that and Rest and Digest, is that we can actually deliberately turn on both of them. But we can turn on our Parasympathetic Nervous System, that's the one, it's all about Rest and Digest, and it's all about slowing down the Nervous System. So just for a minute let's think about this. If you just close your eyes for just a moment and think about these two scenarios with me, so I'm going to ask you just for a moment to close your eyes and picture these two scenarios. So in one scenario we're going to go on a little imaginary journey, umm… we're in British Columbia and we're in a beautiful area, in a cabin, in the woods. We open up the door and we walk out with the garbage. We are gonna throw away the garbage and as soon as we look up we see a bear in front of us, and immediately can feel our heart raising and we start to walk backwards and to back into the house in safety. So just by picturing it and allowing yourself to engage in that moment, you can get a taste of what can happen with your nervous system. Now keeping your eyes closed, I want you to just imagine yourself, in your most favorite place in the world. May be you've been on a beautiful trip at some point in your life or you've just had a park to go to one sunny afternoon, and you have the most delicious fruits and your favourite drinks, maybe you like sparkling water, something to replenish you and you can feel just a sense of being at ease, in a beautiful place and you just take that in for a moment. And then bring yourself back into the room and just open up your eyes and recognize that these states are always inside of us, they will live within us. We can intentionally always find them, if we let ourselves. So, part of the job in doing our jobs and being able to continue to do our jobs is to recognize that if we don't reduce the stress, it depletes us to the point that we can't do our work. And if we make it our business to take care of these important stress markers then we get to continue to do our work for a long, long time. I love what the research is showing in terms of the brain these days. And one study that came up recently show that umm… the brains response to threat was silenced, when we were reminded of being loved or cared for. And this can occur according to the research just by looking at pictures of people or beings, feeling loved and cared for. So this fits in perfectly with the new research on Neuroplasticity and some of the exercises that we've been writing about and teaching people in the last few years and this is challenge number two. And in challenge number two, umm… what I want you to see are these really cute umm… creatures here, umm… the little Leopards and the Ape that we have here. And as I had mentioned to you before there's an issue around wiring our brains and when we're always wired to feel threat and we don't interrupt it with something that works, then that wiring becomes stronger and stronger, and we start believing that it's true. I'm always at brisk, I can never stop, I have to pick up the phone, whatever it is we say to ourselves, we really start to believe it. Even when it's not quite accurate, the only way to break this hard brain wiring is to actually interrupt it. And wonderful way to interrupt it, is to use an exercise, which I call picture positive. And this is a picture positive exercise and we need to do these things very regularly until we rewire something new. And in this case, what I'm going to have you do is look at the pictures, select the animal that you feel most connected to, the one may be with the biggest relaxed worker, the smile or, whatever it is that you feel is closest to your heart. Look at the image and just for a minute, close your eyes and imagine yourself being that animal with that sense of being loved for or cared for or content. And just imagine yourself being that animal for a moment. And then, bring your awareness back into the room and just turn to somebody who's sitting close to you and tell them what it feels like as best as you can capture in a very short exercise, what it feels like to allow yourself to be that animal. So just take a moment and talk to somebody on your right or your left, about what it feels like to be that animal. 

01:06:15
(crosstalk) 

01:06:25
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY And then bringing your awareness back into the room, I want to just get a sense of what you noticed, you're able to achieve in just one minute picturing being uh… one of these animals. Anybody tell me what the experience was like. Can you tell me what you noticed in just one minute, one short moment of exposure to taking the in, the good. What did you notice? 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN Contentment. 

01:07:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY what? 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN Contentment. 

01:07:05
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY You were able to allow yourself to embed that sense of contentment. You looked at one of the animals, you closed your eyes, you saw yourself being that animal, and then you told somebody about it. It changes… It has the power to change something inside. How quickly did that happen for you? 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN Quick! 

01:07:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Quick. 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN In seconds. 

01:07:25
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY In seconds. Okay. So it can change our internal experience. Anybody else noticed anything in doing this exercise? Anything changed for you? What happened? 

01:07:35
UNKNOWN I felt more relaxed. 

01:07:40
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY And you were able to capture. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Warmer. 

01:07:40
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Yes and warmer, a sense of warm. You chose one of the animals, what did you notice right away? 

01:07:50
UNKNOWN What happen we… 

01:07:50
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Like when you looked at the animal, what did it take for you to allow yourself to picture yourself being one of those animals? 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN I regard these most relaxed working one. 

01:08:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. So you chose the one that to you represented relaxation and then you just allowed yourself to know what that feeling was like and to take it in. Anybody else had an experience of just practicing this shortly that I want to hear about, that you want to share? I love looking at these little exercises, because they have the power to shift, what our minds are doing and that is power actually, because we can easily slip into places that are so acutely distressing. So the challenge then becomes, did you resist that at all? Yes. Did you notice yourself resisting it? Isn't that an easy thing to do that we do not allow ourselves to have a different internal experience. What happened? Can you talk about, what happened inside of you that created that resistance? 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN So I struggled to figure out, which I identified with more. 

01:09:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Right. 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN So, it wasn't lot of time. So I looked at one in that, oh that relates neither than the other… was just… I needed more time. I think to allow myself to get into that. 

01:09:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. 

01:09:10
UNKNOWN Eventually I did it, 

01:09:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Right. 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN But it was a process that I couldn't easily embrace. 

01:09:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY So, it takes a little while to allow yourself to sink into something, but remember part of that is, because we're wired to do something else. And sometimes we're wired to not go there. Do not go to the place of comfort. Do not give ourselves nourishment, even when we desperately need it. So, you know, again I ask you these questions, because I'm having you do these exercises is not because I think, that you are absolutely going to embed them today, but because I want to challenge you from the places that you may not be nourishing yourself. Okay. Oh! Yeah, this is so embarrassing. We do these things all the time, when we're rushing through our lives and we absolutely do not see what's going on around us. So, I moved into a house that has a central vac, I never lived in a house with central vac, I didn't know that was all about and, you know, we're vacuuming for a year. And then, we have guests coming over, and we're vacuuming and the whole thing just stops working. It's like we've got guest coming, this is bad. The vacuum cleaner is not working and we got a dog and there's carpet everywhere. And so, I'm going like why isn't it working like it should work? I can't imagine what could happen to it, so I go into the garage, where the canister is and it occurs to me that in the year that we were there, nobody has ever cleaned the canister. Now, this is ridiculous, because where did I think that was going to go, garbage in garbage out, right. No, there was no garbage out, it was just like garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, it just kept on accumulating and I guess I thought it was going to magically disappear and sometimes that's what we think, when we keep overloading ourselves with one thing and another, and we think that it's going to magically disappear or we keep rushing and rushing and forcing ourselves to do more and more. And what some of the research shows is that in fact, people who are stressed are 2 to 3 times more likely than low stressed people to feel depressed, want to quit their jobs, but in fact work overtime. That's kind of sad. We all do these things, right. So I think it's really important that we understand, what we're really suffering and struggling with, to be able to pin point it very precisely. And, umm… I think that, we're, many of us in this culture addicted to speed, and so, one of the things that we absolutely have to learn how to do is to slow down, and it's not an easy thing to do, because most of us are plagued with this need for rapid action and feeling every single moment. In another study participants were asked to go just a little bit faster on a task, it was a cognitive task, something that they had to think through, and those people did much worse than the people who are asked to just go at the speed that they were going. Because we have optimal performance at a certain point, not when we're overly relaxed, but when we are somewhat engaged and stimulated and yet not highly stressed, because there is a point at which we tip over and our thought processes are actually much, much worse. I think probably all of us have had these experiences where we just want to get a little bit more done and then we end up making mistakes that will leave us having to do something over or with much more work, right. We've all been there right. That's not an unusual thing. And that's because at a certain point, our brains are simply not able to do higher order thinking. So literally parts of our brains will shut down. So what I try to train myself to do and that I encourage you to do, that is you noticed yourself tipping over into that place of stress, deliberately slow yourself down. We have a very powerful unconscious mind. A lot of stuff going on beneath the surface and a lot of stuff that is constantly peaking through and if this true and if everything else I said is true, including all that stuff from early childhood or through our lives or at our works that keep intruding, if all that is true, then it is driving the bus. We can be feeling a lot of empathy for everybody around us. We can recognize that when we unconsciously experience the state of others, there is a strong emotion that we then carry. And this can, if it repeats over a long period of time without any break, can leave us feeling overwhelmed and depleted. But more importantly, it can do something to our brain that we don't expect. So, here is a little trick to get us recognizing how powerful our minds actually are. You can see the little monkey up here, the women's looking at it. What I'm gonna ask you to do for one minute of clock time is think about nothing but the little monkey. So, for one minute of clock time and I'm going to time you, think of nothing, but that monkey, and then I'll tell you when we're finished, but really it's only one minute of clock time, so this should be really easy, right? Keep your mind on the monkey and start. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:16:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. So that is one minute of clock time. Just get me a show of hands, how many of you people were able to keep the monkey in their mind for the entire one minute? Oh! Oh! Yes, do you practice meditation or something like that? 

01:16:40
UNKNOWN No. 

01:16:40
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY How are you able to do that? 

01:16:40
UNKNOWN I have no idea. I got really annoyed and stupid. 

01:16:45
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Oh, you were annoying at the monkey, so that's how really got you kind of focussed in a big way on the monkey? 

01:16:50
UNKNOWN Right. It looks a kind of smug. 

01:16:55
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY A smug monkey. Right, okay. So, you had your mind on a smug monkey. Okay, hold that far from a moment, anybody else able to keep, was it hard to keep your mind on the monkey for the whole minute? Was that ? 

01:17:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:17:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. So, let's do the next challenge then, the next challenge is whatever you do in the next minute, do not think about the monkeys. Right. Do not think about the monkey that should be easy, because I made you think about the monkey and now, I annoyed with the monkey, and so, it would be good for you to not think about the monkey. So, whatever you do, it's only a minute, right we can all do this, whatever you do not think about the monkey, no monkeys, keep the monkey out of your head and I'm going to time you for a minute. And just see you're kind of aware of what's happening in your head. If you do think about the monkey just lift up the finger to remind yourself that you thought of the monkey, put your hand down and then don't think about the monkey again okay, one minute let's try. 

01:18:05
[sil.] 

01:19:05
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. So that's one minute. So how is your monkey, did he come back, were you able to keep him out of your head? 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN No, of course not. 

01:19:15
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY What was he like this time? 

01:19:20
UNKNOWN Probably even more annoying. 

01:19:25
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Even more annoying, okay. So, the monkey was hugely annoying at this point. How did other people do? Were you able to keep the monkey out of your head, was there anybody in the room who kept the monkey out of their head? Yes, how did you do that? 

01:19:35
UNKNOWN I was thinking all the things I need to do when I retire (ph). 

01:19:35
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. And you kept your mind real busy. 

01:19:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, in all the things I got to do. 

01:19:40
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Right. So, you laid out the list and if you could, you would have written it all down, and yeah, okay so you have to keep yourself really busy. Anybody else who managed to keep the monkey out of your mind? No, no. Okay, well it's hard to keep a monkey out of your mind really. The reality of this is that when we're exposed to something not has benign as a monkey, well your monkey wasn't benign. Not as benign as a monkey or just screen, but something really riveting, something impact full, something that has been hard for us to deal with. And, we're going through our very busy day, making list and doing all that stuff that we do with our minds, at the end of the day, when we are flatter exhausted and we don't want to pick up the phone, where do you think your mind is gonna go? 

01:20:40
UNKNOWN Monkey. 

01:20:45
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY It's going to go to the monkey. It's going to go to the thing that was riveting for you, it's going to go to the place that was difficult. And this is why, whether you're in emergency services or you're doing clinical work and the cases are very tough that the minute you really try to decompress and relax, all of this content comes up powerfully, keeping you from being able to fully relax and let go. Have people had that experience? You know that, right? We all know what that experience is like and it is hard to train the mind. It's possible to train the mind, but it's actually very, very tough to learn how to do this well, but again going back to this piece about what we need to commit ourselves to and to understand how powerfully this piece plays out in our lives and how, when we go to those negative places, when we go to those tough places they can come up, they can popup at any point, because our unconscious mind is so powerful. So just for people who want access to our Compassion Fatigue Tests and materials, we have a whole set of materials on our portal. And again if you want the links or anything like that either Mandy or Usha can take down your information and they'll make sure that you get the links and the content for our online materials. So, that can you have a sense of how much this stuff is impacting you if it is. So again it's comes back to where are you resisting, where are you betraying yourself? If you have content that is overwhelming you at this time in your life and it's popping up at any time, why is that happening? How is that happening? When does it come to the surface? So, Narissa is cleaning her closet, and she is expecting that one time is enough. We all do this right? We want the one thing to be enough. We don't want to have to keep redoing stuff, we just want to go the gym one time, that would be good, but it's not what happens in life. And so, this is another place, where we betray ourselves, because we don't want to go back over and over again. So what I'm going to ask you to do if you could stand up for a minute and just… 

01:23:15
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

01:23:15
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Yeah. Exactly. I know you have been sitting down and kind of listening to talking and doing stuff all day. And what I'd like to do is actually just feel what it feels like to hold our balance? So, if you could just lift up one foot and without holding anything, see if you could hold your balances. Okay and just feel, just feel, what it feels like to hold your balance and of course the longer you are there, with the higher you lift up your leg and if you were juggling balls, it would be harder and harder to do it. So now put down your leg and just for a minute ask yourself what it is actually take to maintain balance? What does it take? 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN Concentration. 

01:24:05
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Concentration, what else? 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Intention. 

01:24:05
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Intention, what else? 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Patience. 

01:24:05
UNKNOWN Breathing. 

01:24:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Patience, breathing what else? 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN Focus. 

01:24:10
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Focus, what else? 

01:24:10
UNKNOWN Talents. 

01:24:15
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Talent yes, what else? 

01:24:15
UNKNOWN Balance. 

01:24:15
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY What is it? Balance yes. What else? 

01:24:20
UNKNOWN Practices. 

01:24:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Practices. So, we have to keep actually there are multitude of things that happen, when we have our leg up and we're constantly shifting and trying to maintain our balance. If you really pay attention to it, you lift your leg up again, you'll notice that the higher you lift you leg, there are many muscles and different things that have to happen to shift and keep adjusting to the balances and our lives are exactly like this. Because there is nobody that gets to live a life where it's like you put it in place once, one time and it's done. Gloria Marsay… You can sit down now, or you could stay standing up if you need a break. Gloria Marsay wrote an incredible piece about her experiences with compassion fatigue. She was a psychologist, she is a school psychologist and she actually experienced incredibly tough health crises. And what happened with her is that she had all sort of symptoms and she didn't want to look at them, they were tuff symptoms, she was really struggling. But, what she recognized is, it took the crises, a deep crises, a deep change in her life, in order for her to take this piece of her life seriously, where she had to take care of herself and she wrote this very interesting umm… article about her experience of her life changing, when she became ill. And what she really needed to do to shift this focus. She was in a hospital for I think umm… six months and she was so unwell that she had all this time to think about, how she was betraying herself. So, we don't want to go into that place of health crises, what we want to do is, we want to notice the early warning signs and shift and balance to get ourselves back into practice. So, this whole thing about neuroplasticity in the way the brain works is that it is consistently showing that what needs to happen is consistent practice over a long period of time. I wish I could give you a quick fix that would actually work, but the only thing that I have noticed that makes the differences in all the trauma clients that I have worked with, and I worked with a lot of trauma clients over the time, with all the clinicians, emergency responders and helpers that I have worked with, the ones that get better and continue to do well, choose practices that are consistently bringing them back into well being in balances. It's really interesting, because sometimes when I get the opportunity to contrast, to compare and contrast umm… two people in similar careers and the path that one individual goes down versus another, it could be quite interesting to see that when they take on something that is consistently an internal practice to take care of themselves and notice the early warning signs that overall they are able to do so much better. Umm… there… this women… I do a lot of work on social media, and we get permission from lots of people to share content and we do these daily videos… sorry, these weekly videos, where we share information either from a question that we have had or from something that we're thinking about or talking about. And this one woman is talking about these ACE scores, this adverse childhood experiences. And she says that, you know, she got a score of 7, which I think is very high, uh… mean she has had quite a few experiences that have been very difficult, and this is somebody who is working as a helper and umm… she is talking about having up very high ACE score, but doing practice of exposing herself to content that is nourishing for her. So, find out what your content is. One thing, one thing, just take one moment right now and ask to yourself, is there one thing, one little thing that you're willing to do. Just take one moment and write down one thing that you're willing to do for yourself, that you will be consistent with, and notice if there is resistance to it. Notice when you think about that one thing, that you know you're hungry for, ask yourself, are you resisting doing it? Can you really not do it? Do you really not have the time for it? So, when you reflect and I'm gonna just ask you to take a minute and when you think about the one thing that you want to do, just write it down and ask yourself what are you resisting, what keeps you from truly and absolutely committing to this one thing. 

01:29:30
[sil.] 

01:29:40
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY I think, it's really important to recognize that we all get stuck in this place, where we do not feed ourselves, and so, one of the things that I want to do is, give you a little shortcut. We created these daily videos, there are 30 days of them. The first 10 days you can finding at whatisptsd.com/find-calm, and there are just videos that talk about, what you need to do, to get yourself clam and different strategies, some of which we've talked about already today, but there are all things that are set to help you reinforce this idea that you have to work with your body and respect that before you can do anything else now. Again, you can get the link. But the idea is that we worked with these things to help ourselves every single day. So, I just want to ask you in terms of one thing, I don't want to know what your one thing is, what I want to know is, when you write something down and you commit to it, how much of a struggle is it actually do the thing, you're shaking your head, yes it is, isn't do you understand what drives that for you, do you? 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN I do. 

01:31:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Do you know what it is? 

01:31:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think it is guilt, I actually do. I think it's to my… I spend all day at work, I want to spend time with my family and numerous things that need to be done at home and, you know, laundry that needs to done and homework that needs to be done, and, you know, cooking and cleaning out and it's around the guilt. 

01:31:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Do you know what your one thing is? 

01:31:25
UNKNOWN I do. 

01:31:25
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY You know it? 

01:31:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:31:25
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY And it's something you haven't been giving yourself? 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

01:31:30
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Wow! 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:31:30
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay we're going to pick that up. 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:31:35
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Okay. So hold on to your one thing. You first of all believe, you are brave, okay. Second of all, clearly you're caring person, you like to give to other people and you're woven with that, I'm a giver, I'm giving to other people, I give that's what I do. So remember I said that gets woven really powerfully, the other piece not so much, because you haven't practices the other piece. I'm telling you the only reason that I'm consistent with the work, the stuff that I do for myself and I'm really consistent, my staff know that, because I have people coming over to my house once a week to ensure that I go out and exercise, because really I am lazy, like that is the reality, I don't want to do most of the stuff that I do. But I do it, because it actually shifts me out of a place of not being able to do what I need to do. Umm… not being able to care for myself, it means absolutely I cannot do what I do. There would be no possibility of it. So, we all do what you do, it is the hardest thing, it's been… it's a life lesson for me, I have to continually go back to it. So, thank you for saying that out loud and helping us all learn and know that to be true. Good Copers, so I have, as I mentioned before, I have been working with a lot of different kinds of healthcare professionals and I wrote this article about Good Copers, family doctors, or family medical doctors, who are helping until there's nothing left. I don't think that's really all that different than what a lot of helpers do. We give and, give and give until there's nothing left. Umm… nobody else is more important, the laundry is more important, everything is more important, Good Coping is not such a good thing. There was a point in my life where I had to say to myself, I have to notice like my feelings before they get so bad that I'm devastated, because I have to be constantly working at it. Being a Good Coper means, you pull yourself and stretch yourself until the rubber band just breaks. I think probably everybody in this room has watch a colleague or a peer or a friend walk down that path. It‘s a really, really tough thing to see. So, these are the people, all of us included in this room, who function under immense pressure, highly dedicated, put aside personal needs, high achievers and at the breaking point willing to sacrifice even more. You're never meant to abandon yourself to help others. It just isn't the case. It might be the wiring, but it's just not the case. So, I did a training a while ago and one of the things that I saw in the training is very, very interesting. So, we had a conversation about the value of saying no. And in the video umm… you know, the things that we hear people say are, you know, I tell myself to just get over it, stop whining, I neglect myself because I feel guilty, other people are going to suffer up if I don't help, but what about me. I'm a failure. I have no right to feel this way. We say the worst things to ourselves. So, with the doctors that we were looking at, in this research that we were looking at, we saw that there was an increase risk for suicidality for, it was higher among female versus male physicians and hospital based physiatrist versus internal medicine practitioners, who were not necessarily listening to stories, right. And it increased risk of addiction, so we're numbing our feelings then where helpers and providers second, not first. We were meant to be helpers first. We are meant to be people first. Be gentle with yourself. You are child of the universe, no less trees and the stars in the noisy confusion of life keep peace in your soul. What do we need to do to break this habit of thinking that everybody else is more important that we are? Okay, so I have a little challenge for you again. And this one is, I'm going to ask you follow me with this one umm… you have people sitting close to you and if you have don't join somebody, who is. Umm… and what I'm gonna ask you to do is two things. I want you to embody, I want you to own a new statement. And I really do believe this to be true that, you know, we're out there in this world and we're helping. You're like the super heroes in this world. You got to take that in, because you are doing things and helping in ways that at times do not get recognized in the way they need and must be recognized. So, what I'm going to ask you do to is, say to the person beside you I see this superhero in you and she or he is awesome, keep yourself well. 

01:37:00
(cross-talk) 

01:37:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY And now this is the bigger challenge. If everybody has said it, this is the bigger challenge, you may have resisted that. Many of us do when we first hear it. Did you resist it? Is it hard, it's hard to take it in isn't? Now this is the bigger challenge. Let's all stand up. I'm not gonna have you stand on one foot. 

01:37:55
[sil.] 

01:38:00
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY I want you to hear this first, and then let's do it as a group, and just see if we could take it in with the power of this group, with the recognition that the people on the right and the left of you, yes, exactly the people on the right and the right of you really believe this and know this is true for you and you now need to embed it in yourself, I… Listen first. I see the super hero in me, she or he is awesome and I'm committed to keeping myself well. Okay, you hear it, it may be hard to say, you may notice, you may feel some resistance, but let's see what happens, when we say it out loud in the group just notice, notice if you could feel both the resistance and the acceptance. Okay? So, let's do this as a group on 1,2,3. I see the super hero in me and she is awesome, I'm committed to keeping myself well, okay. Just notice, Just notice, if you could take that in. just notice if you could let that sink in that you are worthy of as much care, as the people that you care for and then for just a movement, just close your eyes for a movement, and see if you could say it's softly to yourself quietly in your own mind. I see the super hero in you and she or he is awesome, I commit myself to being well and now in this quieter place ask yourself what part of you is resisting and ask that part to step aside and see if you could let this message just embed a little bit. And then let's all sit-down again. So I want to just ask you, were you able to let it sink in just a little bit? What happens as you say something like this, out loud, what happens when you say something like this in a group? Were you able to take it ingest a little bit? I just want a show of hands up how many people found that they could actually hear the message and let themselves take in some of that, because the reality is it's very easy to resist positiveness, as just we've been kind of trained to not take it in. So, can I have just a show of hands, how many people found that it was hard to take it in, that they were resisted initially? It's hard to take it in. How many people were able to… you had that experience of recognizing that you want to umm… do something and this message is a change from what you normally say to yourself, what was the resistance like? 

01:41:20
UNKNOWN I don't know that I can express it. 

01:41:20
DR. ANNA BARANOWSKY Yeah, but you can feel it, right? Because it sits there within all of us, right? We all have this piece and the reason that I talk about these pieces, because they're the pieces that I hear from all my clients, when the people that I talk to at workshops and training programs and myself, because this is always going to be the piece. So, Peter is a paramedic. He is in extreme pain and he is telling himself, it's just going to go away. How many here are EMS, emergency workers, can you just raise your hands, so I know who you are? No emergency? Okay. So Peter is stressed, now we know that when people are carrying the stress we get all sorts of physical ailments. It's not unusual, we have early warning signs when we are extremely stressed and there are things we need to pay attention to. We all know that. What kinds of things do you experience when you're extremely stressed? What Kinds of things do you notice? Yeah, I was at, I was in Florida, umm… living in a small apartment and I came across a potato bug, which is like the biggest cockroach in the world. And so, my stress reaction was sweating, rapid heartbeat blah, blah, blah… all that stuff, because stress reactions are just what happens to us. Peter is telling himself that he is gonna heal, but now he's had a panic attack, and he feels very humiliated but this happens to all of us, because what happens in our mind and in our body is, we will literally pair unconditional stimulus. So, in this case meat powder is paired that's uh… we're gonna salivate, unconditional response is the salivation, if we pair it with the tone, then just the tone alone is gonna create salivation. For Peter what happen is, he paired any sight, sound or memory related to emergency services or police, so he goes to the movie, there is a scene in the movie, there is an officer down, and he has his panic attack, he gets paired powerfully, because in the web of life it is exactly what happens. These lower level events can create reminders of moments in life that created extreme stress. But what can happen, if we pair them over time in relaxation. I'm really afraid, by the way I'm going to go back to the plane, what happened with the plane, and I fly to lots of places. So I don't have panic attacks on planes, that extremes stress reaction that I had right after 911, went away overtime, because I worked through it and extinguished it, and that's what we all need do to, when we have our big bells and whistles are triggered, when the amygdala is telling us that, there is real danger and if I don't respond right away, I'm going to die. And this becomes hugely important, because we can easily find ourselves in a state where we are always on alarm, even when there is nothing going on. So again, I'm going back to this idea of daily practice and that the nervous system is the key. So there are a lot of different approaches that I like to work with, but what are the ones that is my favourite, is really deep breathing. And we have a lot of different mechanisms to do that, and this one is just of little app that we built that, it seems to have a lot of good outcome, because what ends up happening with this little app is that it shows people almost immediately, how to get themselves out of strain, and into a sense of relaxation. So the app was built to umm… help people with the process of slowing down the breath. Now again a lot of these exercises are available to you, I'm not going to turn this out. First, I want to tell you that a lot of materials that we do have are available to you, there are a ton of materials including some breath training materials. And as I have said, I think that one of the things that deep breathing can do for you is retrain your nerves system, so that it is automatically in a place of deep slow relaxation, that it can shift you out of a state of strain very rapidly and that is power. And what we wanna be able to do is find ourselves in a place, where we can create a shift, no matter what is happening in our lives. So umm… yes, the other piece around being able to take ownership of what is happening to us, in our lives, in our work and certainly if we were in a work place and there is no differentiation, we can find things escalating into a state where we are not doing well at all. And what we found is that, when people are anxious and they are having a interaction with somebody in a work place and it is escalating, we can actually disengage and this can actually make things much worse, it becomes a kind of anxiety generator. And so, what we wanna do is recognize that we can take ownership of the calm, connected state, regardless of what is going on. And finally, Doug, who is in outcaste, that sense of belonging if they massive buffer. Christiana found that individuals with higher self compassion, this is treating ourselves as kindly as we treat anybody else, had lower level of anxiety. And another one of our exercise is a reflection on self compassion and the research is pretty consistent in showing that as we deliver kindness to ourselves, we increase our sense of being at peace, have lower stress and anxiety. And I would challenge you to actually play with this exercise, recognizing that you deserved to have peace in your life, to embrace kindness in your life, peace in your life and health in your life. The exercise was designed to help embed the message. This is the final exercise and the final challenge. And it's one that I'm actually going to send you away with. And again, you can get the links from Mandy or Usha. We are gonna send you out a package of materials, take a moment and just yourself, who are you, what are your blind spots, what do you not see chronically, how do you betray yourself and what can you do today to challenge that? You are the heroes helping other people and you deserve to care for yourself as well and better than you care for anyone else. It's imperative, because it's not possible to continue doing your important work without that commitment. So, I'm going to stop and what I'm going to do is if people have any questions or you want to speak to Mandy or Usha, we are going to be here for a little while and I want to thank you so much for your time, and your awareness of taking care of yourself and thank you very much.
