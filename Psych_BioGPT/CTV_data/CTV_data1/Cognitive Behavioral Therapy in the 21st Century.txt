 Okay. So the dossier you're live? 

00:00:40
JUDITH BECK Ah, there he is. yeah...

00:00:50
JUDITH BECK Hi, dad. 

00:00:50
AARON BECK Hi, Judy. Can you hear me? 

00:00:50
JUDITH BECK I can. I just want to check. Are we on for lunch on Tuesday? 

00:01:00
AARON BECK Monday. 

00:01:00
JUDITH BECK Oh, alright. And I want to you to tell you that, Dan is here too. My brother Dan Beck. He's a cognitive therapist in Boston. who's in the audience. 

00:01:10
DAN BECK Hi. 

00:01:10
AARON BECK Hey Dan. 

00:01:15
JUDITH BECK So, this is great, I just love to have my father who is 88 is in to all this new technology. It's just terrific. He does Skype every week with community mental health centers to therapists who he's supervising. It's just terrific. Okay. So there are about four million people here in the audience. A lot of excitement and the first question that I have I think most people would really be interested to hear you talk a little bit about how you developed cognitive therapy in the first place? 

00:01:45
AARON BECK Well, before I answer your question Judy. I'd like to say how sorry I am that I'm not able to be there in person. I attended the very first conference, which was in 1985 when they had all the great gurus of the time such as Albert Ellis and Carl Rogers and whole host of other major figures in the field. And one time I noticed that Dan Goldman who was a reporter for the New York Times was interviewing some of these people and I is said to Dan, why are you interviewing them and not me. He said, Tim you should be glad that I'm not interviewing them I'm just getting material for their obituaries. So I'm very glad to be here and to be able talk to you in person. Now whenever I do a conference, people always ask the very first question is how did you discover cognitive therapy? So I've been saying this for the last 45 or 50 years but every year I think the story gets more embellished. Actually I never intended to develop a therapy or a theory. All I wanted to do was to see patients and do research and after I finished my psychoanalysis I decided I was going to do some research that would validate the psychoanalytic theories and the theory that I selected was the theory of depression. The theory of depression was pretty clear cut. The whole idea was that individuals who were depressed had a whole well of hostility and this hostility would rise up but it would be sealed off because it was ego alien, it was unacceptable and so the hostility would then be inverted and turned against the self and it would then come out in a whole variety of forms. And so depressed people were self critical. That made good sense. They were suicidal, they didn't enjoy life. They lost all their goals and life. They weren't interested in any of the pursuits that they had wanted previously. So it seems this would be a fairly simple type of hypothesis to test and the way to test it would be through dreams, dreams they should know where the Royal road to the unconscious. And so I did a study in which I collected dreams of depressed patients and dreams of non-depressed patients and I then worked with a psychologist by the name of Marvin Horowitz(ph) and we developed a very nice way of documenting hostility in the dreams of the patients and then Marvin blindly looked at the dreams of the patients and to our surprise the dreams of the depressed patients showed less hostility than those of the non-depressed patients. So this was the first reversal. But we looked at the dreams again and we did see something very interesting, which seemed to fit an idea that we had and this was that in the dream itself, the dreamer was portrayed as a loser. He or she was subjected to all kinds of humiliations, deprivations, abandonment, and losses and so on. And so then it occurred to me, you know this really does make sense. The inward hostility is being expressed as a need to suffer. So this was really what was behind the depression. The depressed people had a need to suffer because their hostility was turned against themselves but this make good sense but I knew that I won't be able to convince anybody of this unless we did some more tests. So one of the first hypothesis that I had about the masochism was that these individuals, the depressed individuals should court rejection. So we set up an experiment in which the depressed patients and non-depressed patients were given the choice of a variety of options but in some cases the option would lead to rejection and other cases to approval. Well compared to the non-depressed people, these depressed people courted approval much more significantly more than the other group. Well, that was our second reversal but then we thought well maybe it isn't just a question of being accepted but it might be a question of failure. They see themselves as losers. So we set up another experiment in which the patients could either court failure to express their needs to suffer or success. And again compared to the control group they're far more likely to choose alternatives that would lead to success. Well this really was a major stumbling block and so I kind of put my research aside for a while and I got back to just looking at patients and analyzing patients and then a very interesting thing came up with the patients. When I would start to interpret their hostility from various aspects of their projections the patients started to get worse. Well I figured now maybe I should go into reverse so I thought maybe I'll just do the opposite of what I've been doing and maybe that'll help. So since the patients have been on the couch I sat them up since I have been just listening up until that time I decided that I would talk to the patients and ask them questions and then I would start to focus instead of on free associations on what they were thinking of at that very time and it turned out that the patients had thought content in their real life, which was very similar to the dreams. In their real-life they were seeing themselves as losers. They saw other people as rejecting them. They felt that they were failures they interpreted other situations as signs of their inadequacy and so on. And so they seemed to fit the dreams. So I thought well maybe this is far as I have to go. Maybe there is inverted hostility, maybe there isn't. But if I can just stick to the level of the patient's vision or image of themselves as being lost and deprived and desolate and so on. And we'll try to get them to correct this image that maybe it might be helpful and it turned out that these patients would consistently misinterpret situations as representing either rejection or failure. But when we use the tools of reason and logic, look for alternative explanations look for questions of whether there was a logic in their interpretations, they managed to see things differently in a more realistic way not necessarily positive but more realistic than they had seen before and when they started to see things realistically their depression started to improve. Well, this posed a serious problem for me economically because after ten or 15 sessions the patients would say Dr Beck you helped me a lot bye bye, I'm leaving. Well, within a period of six months or a year my practice just shrunk to practically zero. And at that point the professor of psychiatry said, Tim, you know, you're not doing so good in practice. Why don't you come full-time and do some teaching. And so I got a job at the university and I started teaching the patients -- started teaching the residents actually the kind of therapy that I had been doing with my patients and one day one of the residents John Rush came up and said you know, this kind of treatment that you are doing is really working for us the residents all love it. But nobody else is ever going to believe that itâ€™s effective unless you do a clinical trial and I said, a clinical trial. That's the last thing in the world that I would want to do it, that's really back breaking. Well John said well, I'll tell you what, you train the residents in cognitive therapy because I'd already given it a name by then and I'll do the research and so we did the research and we compared cognitive therapy with the drug of choice at that time which was Imipramine and it turned out that cognitive therapy actually did a little bit better at the end of treatment and in terms of relapse it did much better and so we are off to the races and from there on, dozens of studies we have done on depression then on other conditions and then cognitive therapy is able to establish a good empirical base. So anyhow, that was the birth of cognitive therapy. 

00:11:00
JUDITH BECK Terrific. He makes it sound kind of easy doesn't he? Alright. Have we have time for a question. If anyone has a question about this topic. If you do then I need you to go to the microphone. I think, I see someone approaching maybe? No. Then we'll move on to the next question. 

00:11:35
AARON BECK Maybe they're so clear that there are no questions or so dense that nobody can understand what I was saying. But we'll see. 

00:11:45
JUDITH BECK I think sometimes people have automatic thoughts about asking questions at a large arena. Something to do about it too. Why don't you tell us a little bit about some of your latest interests, especially in schizophrenia? 

00:11:55
AARON BECK Well, I started I decided a few years ago to start to taper off and so I've just been concentrating on three major areas. One has been on schizophrenia. Another has been on working with suicidal patients. Patients who have made recent suicide attempts and then the third has been on disseminating the therapy through the community in Philadelphia and also through the veterans administration. And so this has been keeping me occupied to some extent. Now I was actually interested in schizophrenia way back in the 1950s and I wrote a paper then in which it was just a single case but it was a patient who had been delusional and in the course of treatment where I just focused on his delusions and had the patient reality test the delusions the patient did get significantly better and then I got involved in other things and I wasn't in a open ward, in a closed ward anymore and so it happened one time I was in Britain at a meeting and I saw there was a poster. 67 patients treated successfully with cognitive therapy of schizophrenia and I never heard of cognitive therapy of schizophrenia before and I thought well, this is very interesting because I always thought schizophrenia might be one disorder that cognitive therapy might not be able to help. And so I managed to get to these two people (inaudible ). It turned out that they were very successful at the time and using cognitive therapy as an adjunct to chemotherapy and other forms of treatment particularly for the positive symptoms and so I thought this would be a good idea and so he started to do some work and some of my colleagues did similar work. And one of the cases that came in was a patient who believed that she had a chip in her head that was broadcasting negative statements to her and we did a lot of things about her beliefs regarding weather these voices that were been transmitted through the chip whether the voices were uncontrollable and we showed her how she could control her voice. She thought that the voices were omnipotent and they could control her and we showed that, that was not true and also they were not omniscient and so on. And in the course of time we started to talk about whether there actually was a chip in her brain and she said was she really thought that there was because she had no other way of accounting for the voices. So I asked her if the chips been in your brain, how long has it's been there? She says, probably been in there ten or 15 years. And I asked well, what powers the chip? and she says well I guess there must be a battery there and I said can a battery last ten or 15 years and she said gosh I don't know, and then I said how can we find out? She said well I could go to RadioShack and indeed she went to RadioShack and they tell they didn't think that a battery could last that long. So that made a little dent in her delusion but what finally convinced her that this was a false belief was an event that occurred sometime after that when she was in an accident at a far off city and they took X-rays of her head and she asked them if they could see anything and they said no we can't see anything they showed her the X-rays and she could not see the chip in her head. So that kind of persuaded her that perhaps her delusional thinking was wrong, it didn't persuade her 100%. So anyhow, this was the kind of intervention that we could use with the positive symptoms and it helped a large number of patients. However, the one type of symptom that seemed to be totally intractable with the negative symptoms and as you all know that negative symptoms of the five As is anergia, affective loss, asocial, and anhedonia, alogia and so on and this is really the hard-core of psychosis in a way the hard-core of psychiatry, psychology, and the mental health professions is that patients with a negative symptoms take up more time and more money than any other type of disorder over a long period of time. So we started to interview the patients I was working with my colleague Paul Grant and we came up with the following formulations that there actually is a person in the psychosis up until then it was believed that the patient had holes in the head and that these deficits would account for the deficits and the feelings and the deficits in their behavior and the deficits in their speech and so on, but we thought perhaps there's another way of looking at this and so we thought well let's say, that one of these young people does have problems in attention and executive function and memory and so on. This leads to their not really been tuned in. They have series of failures at school, their family is disappointed in them, the school, the schoolmates pick on them and they start to get an image of themselves similar to what I've talked about in depression similar themselves as failures and unsociable and they then buildup a protective wall against being further rejected and further disappointed and protective wall against failures and so well Paul and I developed several questionnaires. One of the questionnaires had to do with social acceptance and it turned out that they themselves were rejecting social acceptance. So they had all series of attitudes such as other people don't count and so on. Now when we did an analysis, a statistical analysis, we found that these asocial attitudes then predicted and could account for their asocial behavior far more than their problems of attention and memory. So that the major problem when were seeing them it's not the neuro cognitive problem but is a psychological problems that they have more or less given up with other people but at the same time if you ask these people what were they like, they say well I would like to have friends. I'd like to have a family. I'd like to be able to work and yet they have build this crust around themselves so it became impossible for them to actually fulfill their own wishes. So then we decided to take a look at their performance deficits and similarly to the asocial attitudes. They had attitudes of both performance such as if I try something it's unlikely to fail, if I fail it is something it means I'm a total failure or it's best not to try something because I might fail at it and we then found that if we could focus on these particular attitudes that they would start to spruce up and their performance got better. Well, we also found that the people who had the thought disorder where they just ramble off or they won't talk at all had attitudes about social acceptance, they had a fair of negative evaluation. So we thought maybe this is the kernel of their problem not the problems in their thinking per se. So as we saw to this we put together a package and we started to conduct a clinical trial which is still going on but the essence of the clinical trial is a random assignment of patients either through cognitive therapy, treatment as usual and so far we found some very interesting things that patients become more social, they're moving up in terms of occupation activity a whole level instead of staying at home and watching TV and smoking all the time, they're able to move out into protected home, protected adult house. If they're in adult home they're able to move into independent living and so on. So this has been really a very exciting change also many of our patients become more sociable, they're having friends, some are getting engaged, some are about to get married and what's interesting also is with this improvement in their social and occupational function there's also an improvement in their neuro cognitive aspects so that their attention is better, their memory is better, their executive function is better. So this seems to fill that we have a very powerful tool the same tools that were successful in treating depression anxiety personality disorders can be adapted to the treatment of these schizophrenia patients. However, it has to be adapted and you have to go with a very at the very level that these are functioning on. Now some of these patients are functioning at a very low level. So you might ask them, well, I'd like to tell me your thoughts and your feelings and they'd say well how you do tell the difference between a thought and a feeling. With one of the patients we, the therapists was able to say well a feeling is usually one word and the thought is several words and the patients Oh, that's good. Now I know the difference between thought and feelings then patients but how do I know what my feeling is and so therapist then has shows the patient a series of pictures with a smiling face and a depressed face and a neutral face and an angry face and then the patient can pick out which face represents that feelings. So that maybe one level that were operating at, nonetheless, we still use the same ordinary strategies and as the study is going on, our hope is that it's going to turn out the way it has so far and that we would be able to disseminate a whole new treatment for schizophrenia. And that's all I know about that. 

00:22:55

00:23:00
JUDITH BECK Maybe what we'll do, because it's a little hard logistically to get questions here as maybe we'll save the questions to the end if that's okay. But I... 

00:23:10
AARON BECK I like to -- if it could be interactive and give the audience a chance to ask questions well they have it in their mind. 

00:23:15
JUDITH BECK That's great. Anyone would like, then go to the microphone please. Please. Please go ahead. 

00:23:20
 Dr. Beck, I've been thinking about this question since last time I saw you at the last evolution on psychotherapy conference. I just like your thoughts on if you see any difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and the burgeoning acceptance and commitment therapy. The difference I see is that in cognitive therapy we have quickly identify their automatic negative thoughts and try to discount them or you know identify them and not believe them where as acceptance and commitment therapy over we view all thoughts as just thoughts and you know, electrical impulses and we don't have to give credit and judgment to any thought. I just want -- I like your thoughts on that? 

00:24:10
AARON BECK Could you repeat the question, Judy. 

00:24:15
JUDITH BECK Maybe I could repeat it. What do you see as the similarities and differences between cognitive behavior therapy and acceptance therapy. And what he was saying was that in his view in cognitive therapy, you identify thoughts and then have -- help people see the distortions help them evaluate their thoughts and respond to them whereas you know in ACT what you would do is help patients just see thoughts as the mechanism of neural impulses in their brain and just as plain as thoughts not needing to interact with them. 

00:24:50
AARON BECK So the question has to do with the similarities and differences between acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive therapy. Is that correct? 

00:25:00
JUDITH BECK Especially, especially conceptual. 

00:25:00
AARON BECK This is a question we've been just as recently as today I have been talking to James Herbert about the similarities. Actually when -- just to start with a very concrete empirically driven observation. When he has these people listen to the tapes of people who receiving ACT that is called acceptance therapy or cognitive therapy they don't see a great deal of difference. So that's just the start is to show that this is a kind of a difficult question to answer. Now what Herbert believes so we kind of step aside from the cognitive therapy people what Herbert believes is there's a quite a big difference and emphasis rather than a big difference in strategy. So that cognitive therapy -- as you see in the books does have this kind of acceptance of the thoughts and the non-critical acceptance of thoughts and the kind of the meditative. So that is part of cognitive therapy. And much of the distancing that you see in ACT is also present in cognitive therapy, but there is a difference in emphasis. The biggest difference according to Herbert and there is a whole book coming out on this topic which I would recommend to you when it comes out and also Herbert's written several articles, the biggest difference has do with the philosophy and with the theory that drives the two therapies but there is a good deal of overlap however it is true that cognitive therapy is different in the one respect that you mention and that is that we do look at the individuals cognitions and we do deliberately try to get them to test it out. So that is a differentiating feature. The acceptance part is true of both of the therapies but I think the major aspect, the main thing to think about in terms of cognitive therapy and other therapies is what is the theory that's driving it. Now cognitive therapy does have a very rich blueprint and with this blueprint or kind of a map you can choose what type of treatments you are going to use. For example, Bob Leahy, who's President of the American Behavior of Cognitive Therapy Association uses the cognitive theory but he says at times he uses techniques from the DBT - Dialectic Behavior Therapy and other times techniques from psychodynamic therapy and other times techniques from ACT acceptance therapy. So this is where there is a change then from the last conference and that cognitive therapy to come much broader and my theory is that if you're going into a strange town you want to have a map to get around the town but to get to the town and get around it you can go by train and go by automobile, you can go by helicopter or you can go by a broom handle but there's a variety of ways you can do it but the main thing in cognitive therapy are I believe, the main distinguishing feature should be the theory and I believe its the theory that carries everything. Now when I first started out with my theory of depression I had no idea that it was accurate. But since then they've been over 1,000 studies that have dealt with the theoretical aspects of cognitive therapy and they about 90% of the studies have been supportive. So the main difference then to get back to your question between ACT and cognitive therapy, I think with the theoretical framework but if you look at the actual practice of the ACT therapist and the cognitive therapist, you'll see that there is an awful lot of overlap with the one exception of the cognitive therapy people do usually but not always try to evaluate the patients, interpretations or misinterpretations. So 

00:29:20
JUDITH BECK Good answer. 

00:29:25
AARON BECK Long answer for a short question. 

00:29:25
JUDITH BECK Do we have another question. Yes. 

00:29:30
 I was wondering if there was any work done with cognitive therapy, with disorders of childhood like reactive attachment disorder or autism? 

00:29:40
AARON BECK  Yes. 

00:29:45
JUDITH BECK Did you hear the question? 

00:29:45
AARON BECK There's been a, there's been a lot lot of therapy with the high functioning autistic people or just a people and just as there have been with people adults with attention deficit disorder and that is these individuals build up a lot of negative beliefs about themselves. They build up beliefs about they being different, about being losers, being deficient and so on. So long as there are dysfunctional beliefs then cognitive therapy does have a role. Beyond that having to do with a specific artistic features I don't know of any cognitive therapy work that at least has been published on that. I imagine that eventually there maybe though. 

00:30:35
JUDITH BECK Next from over here. 

00:30:35
 Dr Beck, working with patients with chronic pain I was especially interested in the techniques you described for helping schizophrenics identify their feelings. I wonder if techniques like that might be useful to counter the alexithymia often seen in some patients with psychosomatic and similar disorders? 

00:31:05
AARON BECK Yeah. Well, well let me answer your question by giving you a much broader answer and then we'll get to the pain and alexithymia. There's been a particular set of patterns that we've been seeing in every single psychosomatic disorder and I'd like to go away from pain just for the moment and talk to you about a disorder that I've been consulted about recently and that's something that's called post concussion syndrome. Now the patients with post concussion syndrome have been exposed to the road side bombs and as a result of that they devoured something like PTSD, they get headaches, they get flashbacks and some of them start to feel various paralytic symptoms and so on. Now what we've discovered is you can get two individuals two veterans, soldiers who have been exposed to exactly the same number of roadside bombs the same amount of explosive devices and the same amount of trauma. Now one of them is able to return home to his family gets occasional headaches, doesn't sleep as well. Sometimes has flashbacks but has a full time job and is able to get on with the family. The other person returns home, develops insomnia, gets terrible headaches, starts to feel lot of paralytic symptoms and becomes bedridden. Now what we found is there's a psychological not a physical difference between the two. They both show exactly the same amount of problems in the brain imagery but psychologically they're totally different. The second individual tends to catastrophize, tends to focus on the symptoms all the time, tends to use avoidance or other types of escape mechanisms tends to avoid any type of situations that would be reminiscent of the bombing which means he won't watch TV, afraid to talk to people can't even hear the word war and so on and then escapes into his own cocoon. Now what we found with all of these psychosomatic ailments and we'll get back to pain in a minute, all the psychosomatic ailments shows three cardinal features. The first is that they focus on every symptoms that they have every sensation that they have becomes a very sharp focus for them. The second thing is that they catastrophize. They start thinking of absolutely the worst possible thing so if they feel a little tingling sensation in their fingers they think that this is an expansion of something going on in their brain and the third thing is that they use what we call safety behaviors. They either avoid situations that they are afraid of going to bring on the symptoms or they go for reassurance to people and so they never get a chance to look at their symptoms realistically and so this is true of people with PTSD, it's true of people with chronic fatigue syndrome, true of people with hypochondriasis. Now the people with pain have some what similar situation and that is they tend to the people with safe chronic backache might be able to function pretty well and do alright or they might become invilaged. The people who become invilaged show the following features, they focus on their pain all the time, they catastrophize about the pain and then they avoid doing anything, any kind of work and so on. As a result of that, they get depressed or they might get alexithymic which means they don't have feelings at all. They lose contact with their feelings or they become so depressed that they again get themselves into a cocoon. And so I think, you know, I would like the audience to mention some kind of psychosomatic or medically related disorder that doesnâ€™t have these three cardinal features in there and so we can deal with all of the medically related disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome even obesity which gives authority on. We can deal with them by thinking in terms of this pattern the patterning that the people have. It's also true with people who have insomnia. They show this typical triad. The terrible triad I call it. Now if anybody has a question on anyone of these disorders I'll be happy to talk about it. 

00:36:15
 An observation perhaps? 

00:36:15
AARON BECK Excuse me. 

00:36:20
JUDITH BECK An observation. 

00:36:20
 Yeah. 

00:36:20
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:36:20
 Tim? 

00:36:25
JUDITH BECK Yes, please go ahead. 

00:36:25
 Is this mike on? 

00:36:30
JUDITH BECK Yes. 

00:36:30
 Okay well this is Don Michaboundtim(ph). 

00:36:30
AARON BECK Okay. 

00:36:35
 And I want. And before I ask a question I want to convey the gratitude of the field of psychotherapy and me personally to your contributions. 

00:36:50
AARON BECK Thank you, Don. This gives me an opportunity to publically congratulate you and all the terrific work you've done. I thank you, Don. 

00:37:00
 Well, okay. I mean, how many mental health workers win the Lasker award and get interviewed by Charlie Rhodes. I mean, what more could we want in the field? The next observation that I have is that I hope that when I reach your age I look as good and as clear in my presentation. 

00:37:30
AARON BECK You should be better, much better. 

00:37:35
 And not only that we expect you to be equally stride and have the same acumen in 2013. 

00:37:45
AARON BECK Thank you. Thank you. 

00:37:50
 Now to my question. What do you make of the recent comparison outcome studies that have looked at the behavioral activation versus cognitive therapy the work of Steve Holland and others. What do you -- how do you interpret the relative effectiveness of this and those kinds of comparative outcome studies? 

00:38:15
AARON BECK Well, I can tell you in general coz clinical experience also figures into this. When we first started working with depressed patients, it was obvious that the usual cognitive interventions weren't going to get through to them. They had a kind of a topper and so on and so we started to use something we called mastery and pleasure therapy which consisted of giving them a schedule of activities and have them record whether a particular activity was represented mastery or pleasure and so we did everything we did we get them going and then I realized that the behavior therapy people had also been working on something similar which they called behavioral activation and so it turns out that behavioral activation is most effective with the severely depressed patients. They can still use cognitive interventions with many of them but the behavioral activation is a sign of quite unknown, and so in my opinion although literature is scanty on this. Behavioral activation is really a very essential type of intervention if you're going to use if you're going to be dealing with severely depressed patients. The less severely depressed patients will often, often not function pretty well anyhow and so the ordinary cognitive or the acceptance type treatment can work with them. Now the literature is still very scanty in terms of the comparison between behavioral activation alone and cognitive therapy in the total package and so there's only been really one study and one needs to now look at other studies and see just what place there is in behavioral activation as opposed to the usual cognitive restructuring techniques. So its still too early to answer your question. 

00:40:20
 We'll see you in 2013. 

00:40:25
AARON BECK 2013 will give you the answer. 

00:40:30
JUDITH BECK Another question over here. 

00:40:35
 My question, Is it on? my question is following I worked with a schizophrenic in Connecticut in 2004 and going back to where you were saying you referenced a patient with a chip on her head, his problem was he was listening to these voices that was leading him to auto-destruct(ph) and I realized and I started, utilizing voice against the voices. I ask him what will he do? What will the voices do if he pays no attention and he say, they go crazy and I enjoy it. I said why people are enjoying it, you know, so it started to utilize that and he started to move away from the medication and what not and then six months later, you know, he was feeling okay. So it seemed that where you were saying what I find out with my own, is there something that could be learned or researched in that area about utilizing these delusions on the schizophrenia against himself so the patient will get better? 

00:41:50
AARON BECK Judy, can you repeat the question. 

00:41:55
JUDITH BECK Sorry, I just didn't hear you well enough. 

00:41:55
 Okay. The question is utilizing the raise for therapy. Now he talk about the person who has a chip on the head -- she has a chip on her head and my question the voices was advised him to auto-destruct. So I used that voices, entirely against himself because he said that when he didn't pay attention, they went crazy and he enjoyed it. So I said well, enjoy it more and don't pay no attention. So he started to and he move away from the medication he had. 

00:42:35
JUDITH BECK So I think one of the things that this therapist did was to suggest that the patient not pay attention to the voices. And then it seemed to work. 

00:42:50
 Yes, because he started using his own mentality going against what the voices were saying and he enjoyed that they got mad or they got upset. You realizing now how to decide how to feel better against what the voices were saying against him and he not paying no attention. That by giving that motivation to move away from that delusional out of the prescription. 

00:43:15
JUDITH BECK That sounds very important. In fact, I know that you have some techniques. 

00:43:20
AARON BECK Yeah. 

00:43:20
JUDITH BECK For helping patients when they are hearing voices. 

00:43:25
AARON BECK I think that's a very good point. I'd like to just tell you a quick anecdote. I once was at a conference and I presented materials just like I was doing today. And then the women got up said she has a son who was very terrified by the voices and she said to him you don't have to listen to the voices, they can't hurt you. And the son was very much relieved. So, its just the simple aspect of not listening to the voices can be very helpful. But you have to caution the patients not to fight the voices but to just not to listen to them. However there are other techniques because sometimes the voices are so strong that simply suggesting not listening to them isn't sufficient and so we have a technique which really works very well and which shows the patients they can control the voices and this is something that we call look, point, name and so as the patient but he is here in the voice we can to the right in the office look at something like look at that book over there look there point at it and name it so looking involves the eyes, the central modalities pointing involves the motion the muscular, motor part and then naming it brings out the variable and this can nip the voices in the bug. Now the voice may come back after a while but just focusing on other things then helps the patient get a sense that they can control the voice and the voices is not so uncontrollable and with many of the patients then the voices can then recede into the background and they can then continue to function even though the voices are buzzing away and it's interesting many of these people can hold pretty good jobs and the voice is going on all the time but they're focusing on their work. So only when they go home and take a shower and a shower that brings out the voices again that they get into trouble. But for the most part just being totally absorbed in something outside themselves. Now this is similar to what I was saying about the people with the medically related disorders where the people are focusing on their symptoms and so the answer was to get them not to focus they're catastrophizing, you get them to de-catastrophize and they're avoiding situations and we get a patient hallucinating patients to stop avoiding, get out of the house, get involved in real life and then interestingly enough they become less prone to have the hallucinations. So that's a very good question. 

00:46:10
 Thank you. 

00:46:10
JUDITH BECK I thought I would interject with the question. I know that you're always thinking about the future of cognitive therapy. I thought you might want to say a word about an organization of which you're the Honorary President, The Academy of Cognitive Therapy. 

00:46:25
AARON BECK Well a big this is how the Academy of Cognitive Therapy got started. We found that there are many people who are doing cognitive therapy but the big problem is that when we get requests for seeing a patient in Keokuk, Iowa or in Yellowstone Park or some other place throughout the country and they're asking for referral. We have no way of knowing which therapists are actually doing cognitive therapy and so we established this organization called the Academy of Cognitive Therapy and there are various levels of membership. Now one level of membership of people who are interested primarily in doing cognitive therapy but they haven't had the extensive training. So one level we had that and then we have people who've had extensive training and now certified as being having had the total training in cognitive therapy. And so the Academy of Cognitive Therapy is really very important from the standpoint of being able to disseminate cognitive therapy and making it available to all the people who really want to have it. 

00:47:50
JUDITH BECK This service is particularly interesting because the other Dr Beck as we call him at the Beck Institute contributes to the list served as do the newest members and we have the most interesting discussions theories of cognitive therapy people present clinical cases and get advice from cognitive therapists of every Elk and from some of the experts in the field. So it maybe something that you'd like to look into? 

00:48:15
AARON BECK So how do people? 

00:48:15
JUDITH BECK And now I can 

00:48:15
AARON BECK How do people find out about the Academy? 

00:48:20
JUDITH BECK That would be academyofct.org oh no it's a very inclusive group. So we want people to join, just have an interest in cognitive therapy even if they are psychotherapeutic modality might be quite different from that. 

00:48:40
 Yeah. 

00:48:40
JUDITH BECK So you have question over here? 

00:48:40
 Yes. Hi. Iâ€™m a child psychiatrist and I went to the Academy of Child Psychiatry Conference two years ago and a big focus in anxiety disorders was about the lift of timing or the decrease benefit of cognitive behavioral therapy treatment and then remission ending and my question is one as I guess the train to challenge your cognitions why did they go way versus like maybe abnormal hormones or neuro transmitters. Then the second part of my question is, if this is true have you found over the years that there is a need for booster treatments like to tell someone come back and see me in six months and we'll review your, you know, steps and see how it's going. Thank you. 

00:49:25
AARON BECK I think the second question has to do with booster sessions. Is that right? Judy. 

00:49:30
JUDITH BECK Yes. Especially in our CBT-4 for child and adolescent therapy. 

00:49:40
 And the reason mostly is because of the remission rate talking about how that its, it doesn't sustain you know, a certain amount of time, I'm not able to give exactly. 

00:49:50
AARON BECK You know cognitive therapy is a kind of learning process and the learning doesnâ€™t end when the patient leaves the therapy and so what we try to do is we have something we call relapse prevention and we, particularly with our suicidal patients we have them go through something like a dress rehearsal which they anticipate situations in the future that might make them want to commit suicide and so want when the patient leaves therapy to have a whole bundle of strategies to deal with problems when they arise with the idea that the problems will arise and each time that the patient is able to cope with these problems that adds to their learning and so it tends to strengthen cognitive therapy over time. However, the time and therapy is often quite limited and the whole learning process doesn't have a chance to take totally and indeed with children and adolescence new situations come up all the time and so I think it's always valuable if you're doing clinical practice to have what we call booster sessions. Have the patients come back say after two weeks and then a month and six months and a year. And it's interesting how effective these booster sessions are. There was a time when I was in full-time practice and my wife would answer the phone periodically a patient would call and say is Dr Beck there and my wife would say no. Can I take a message and the patient would say value tell him such and such and then the patient would go on with the description of the problems and then my wife would say okay, that's fine. I'll tell Dr Beck and the patient would say that's okay I feel much better now you don't have to tell him. The whole point is that is that even the contact with the therapist or indirectly with the therapist's surrogate maybe enough to prime the old learning and that's why it's important to have the therapist available if not it's very important for the patients to have diaries that they can refer to or reading materials. But you can't expect that a course of therapy is going to be able to prepare the patient for every contingency that's going to occur in the future. And I have had patients who would come back after one, two, three, four years they were seeing when they were single and they got married they had new set of problems they come back and talk to me about that and then later on they would have to get into more treatment. 

00:52:35
JUDITH BECK A question from the middle. 

00:52:40
 Okay. Dr Beck. It's a honor that I talk to you. I have a simple questions here. Looking back to our long career of success and achievements what advice would you give to people in this room probably including your daughter sitting in the front. 

00:52:55
AARON BECK Including my daughter what? 

00:52:55
 Sitting in the front. 

00:53:00
 What advice would you give to practitioners nowadays? 

00:53:05
AARON BECK I still didn't get the question. What was it? 

00:53:05
JUDITH BECK Well, okay, what advice would you give to practitioners who are sitting in the audience? 

00:53:10
AARON BECK Well, I think first of all you have to be optimistic and start off with every patient with the idea that somehow or other you're gonna help the patient to solve the problems. The second is you got to be persistent and no matter how intractable the problem may seem you gotta keep trying and trying, try one thing and try another thing that's why I said cognitive therapy is fairly eclectics as long as you stay within the general framework and if you find that one type of thing doesn't work with a patient without just jumping too fast to another thing then you try another approach. The whole idea of the therapy is to the adapt the therapy to the patients rather than adapt the patient to the therapy and that I would say is the major thing major bit of advice I'd give to practitioners. Thank you. 

00:54:05
 Thank you. Thank you. 

00:54:10
JUDITH BECK We take one more question. Okay. The last question from this side. 

00:54:15
 Hi Tim. It's Debbie Joffe Ellis here. Ellis wife and in addition to the an enormous respect Al had for you and your work he was grateful for your friendship. And would you be willing to share with us some of your favorites interactions or memories of interactions of times you spend with Al? 

00:54:45
AARON BECK What was the question? 

00:54:50
JUDITH BECK The question is from Debbie Joffe Ellis, Al Ellis' wife. 

00:54:55
AARON BECK Yeah. 

00:54:55
JUDITH BECK Who wants you to share her memory of being with Al? 

00:55:05
AARON BECK Well, you know, I often had very interesting memories with Al, the one I found most amusing was the time when we would have our annual conference at the APA and in one of this conferences as you know, Al had a hearing aid which he could turn on and off at will and one time the Frank Foley who is the moderator asked me what I was doing and I went on in great length talked for about ten to 15 minutes since I was the first. Then he turned to Al and said Al, what do you think of what Tim just said and Al said, well to tell you the truth I didn't hear a goddamn word he said. He turned off his hearing aid. 

00:56:00
JUDITH BECK Well, I hope you enjoyed the conversation tonight. 

00:56:10
[sil.] 

00:56:20
AARON BECK Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, so much.
