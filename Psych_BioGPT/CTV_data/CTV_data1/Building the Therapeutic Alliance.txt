MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, my name is Matt Englar-Carlson and I'm the host of this video series on the skills of counseling. First program is on Building the Therapeutic. I'd like to welcome our featured expert, my friend and colleague, Dr Leah Brew. Welcome! 

00:00:35
LEAH BREW Thanks. 

00:00:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Why don't we start by getting a sense of who you are as a counselor. What is your approach to counseling? 

00:00:45
LEAH BREW Umm… The first thing I try to do is establish relationship… 

00:00:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:00:50
Leah Brew, PhD 

00:00:50
Department of Counseling, California State University, Fullerton 

00:00:50
LEAH BREW …with the client. So this is a good fit for me to talk about this proportion. Umm… I really want to understand the client's world like how they see things, uh… I try to open myself up to feel kind of what they're feeling. 

00:01:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:10
LEAH BREW Umm… I also look for patterns… 

00:01:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:10
LEAH BREW …so I'm always listening for ways in which there are no repeating patterns in their life. 

00:01:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:20
LEAH BREW And then umm… I what I try to do is facilitate awareness of some, some sort. 

00:01:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So sounds like you're, you're really present with your clients. You're looking for some type of awareness of awareness they're going to have, umm… but you're really trying to create setting in which you're really with the client. 

00:01:40
LEAH BREW Yeah, I, I was trained umm… with the Rouge (inaudible )and bias… 

00:01:43
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:45
LEAH BREW …umm… and I guess I drink the Kool-Aid and I really think that by establishing a certain environment that feel safe… 

00:01:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:50
LEAH BREW …and where people feel understood… 

00:01:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:55
LEAH BREW ….and valued… 

00:01:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:01:55
LEAH BREW …that they will move more in a growth direction. 

00:02:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:02:00
LEAH BREW So I… I try to set that foundation. 

00:02:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, it sounds like you have kind of humanistic, a kind of person centered, kind of approach that the actual core. Other… 

00:02:10
LEAH BREW Yes, at the very beginning… 

00:02:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …other, other kind of theoretical influences you have or kind of how do you integrate theory into your work? 

00:02:20
LEAH BREW Umm… So I was trained as I said with a Rouge (inaudible ) and emphasis but by a bunch of adlerians. 

00:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:02:25
LEAH BREW So… 

00:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's of the worst thing in the world. 

00:02:25
LEAH BREW No, no, so there is this also adlerian piece about striving for significance… 

00:02:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:02:30
LEAH BREW …belonging that's umm… always resonated with me. 

00:02:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:02:35
LEAH BREW umm… But in my doctoral program I saw a presentation or a demonstration of Gestalt therapy and it blew me away… 

00:02:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:02:40
LEAH BREW …and in 30 minutes watching this person have multiple insights, it was just amazing. Umm… So I trained as a good Gestalt therapist… 

00:02:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:02:50
LEAH BREW …for a couple of years. 

00:02:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:02:55
LEAH BREW And then more recently umm… I went to therapy for one of my own issues and ended up with an EMDR therapist… 

00:03:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is that? 

00:03:00
LEAH BREW … and actually had a profound impact. So I'm training to do EMDR as well. 

00:03:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:03:05
LEAH BREW I think umm… my, my, my position my way of being is rogerian (ph). My facilitation I guess is more Gestalt… 

00:03:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:03:20
LEAH BREW … and then trying to enhance awareness umm… but I also have pieces when I find traumas that may impact that I find using EMDR is really helpful in that, it's called the AIP model, Adaptive Information Processing Model… 

00:03:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:03:35
LEAH BREW …for understanding the origins of where people get stucks… 

00:03:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:40
LEAH BREW …so (inaudible ) piece of get stuck and how they use that to help them move through that stuckness. 

00:03:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, it's sounds like you're pretty integrated of many ways and sounds of kind of how you view the work uh… your presence and then you also have to look at a skills you're building. Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:50
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. Yes, it's evolved over time. 

00:03:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah, I actually really like that but you're talking about how you're learning new things. So I think sometimes our viewers might look at our uh… as a professionals or their (inaudible ) and say all that person's got it and you're really modeling how you know we're all lifelong learners in the field changes and that has happened and we can, we can improve. 

00:04:15
LEAH BREW Right. And I change… 

00:04:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:04:15
LEAH BREW …right, what I, what I needed early in… 

00:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:04:20
LEAH BREW …my training… 

00:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:04:20
LEAH BREW …. was empathy. So, umm… getting good at that was really difficult… 

00:04:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:04:25
LEAH BREW …and important to me and then fully experiencing, right…. 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:04:30
LEAH BREW … and so now it was working through trauma so I think… 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:04:30
LEAH BREW …whatever I'm working on that's the treatment that I usually focus on. 

00:04:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. You've talked a little about some of your doctoral experiences but I'm wondering can tell us a bit about your background and how you came to become a professional counselor. 

00:04:45
LEAH BREW Huh… So, uh… it's starts very early. We, when I was in third grade we moved to a small town… 

00:04:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:55
LEAH BREW …and the K.K.K had recently killed the last African-American family… 

00:05:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well… 

00:05:00
LEAH BREW …before I moved there. So it was a very homogenous Caucasian… 

00:05:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:05:05
LEAH BREW …culture and there were two churches the Baptists in the Methodists and everybody went to one or the other except for me. Uh… And I got made fun of for umm… being Chinese, so I ran home to my mom I said, "Mom, am I Chinese?" She says, "No, you're not"! I don't know what this means but I'm like so relieved to go back to school the next day and she says, and she says, "No, you're Japanese", so I go to school, I'm like, no, it's okay, it's okay, so they still make fun of me for being Japanese. So I agonize for a few years as and then sixth grade get this teacher who makes us read a self-help book. 

00:05:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hmm… 

00:05:35
LEAH BREW And I read I'm okay. You're okay? 

00:05:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow! Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:40
LEAH BREW And I, I thought for the first time I'm not alone and I thought this is what I want to be when I grow up. I want to help people like this… 

00:05:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow. 

00:05:45
LEAH BREW So that was sort of the origins of it and I pursued umm… psychology for my undergraduate… 

00:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:05:55
LEAH BREW …and then umm… ended up in counselor education… 

00:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:05:55
LEAH BREW …for my master's that fit me better. I am and some volunteer work as a rape crisis counselor,… 

00:06:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:06:00
LEAH BREW …and ended up with a client that I now know had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 

00:06:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Okay. 

00:06:10
LEAH BREW Umm… but I was so helpful I had poor boundaries with the client and so she had my home phone number… 

00:06:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Oh, wow! 

00:06:15
LEAH BREW …calling me… 

00:06:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:06:15
LEAH BREW …multiple times at night… 

00:06:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:06:15
LEAH BREW ..and I thought oh my gosh I don't want to do this. Umm… So then I found counselor education which was a much better fit, I liked that umm… a lack of pathologizing and the increase other sort of humanistic relationship developmental, and I think the assumption that people moving toward growth. I really… 

00:06:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:06:35
LEAH BREW …believed in that. So that's how I came into this path. 

00:06:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like you have a (inaudible ) that people kind of have growth and that, that there's positivity in their lives and potential. Umm… I'm wondering if you get how you kind of experience that in your background too if there are, you know, times what you can experience that they help you to grow to who you are as a counselor today. 

00:06:55
LEAH BREW Yeah, I think umm… the… no, no, the training that I've gone… 

00:07:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:07:05
LEAH BREW …through has set me up or helped me move in a growth direction… 

00:07:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:07:10
LEAH BREW …and I also think I've always been there anyway I mean… 

00:07:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:07:10
LEAH BREW …from that first experience of racism… 

00:07:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:07:15
LEAH BREW …umm… all the way through I was looking for meaning, I was it's very essential, right. I was looking for purpose like why, why are we suffering, where does it come from, why are people mean, why are people nice… 

00:07:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:07:30
LEAH BREW I really feel like that was something burning inside of me that… 

00:07:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:07:35
LEAH BREW …get uh… need for growth. 

00:07:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:35
LEAH BREW Umm… and, and I find that in working with my students or the clients that I work with, that in some ways many people have that same experience. 

00:07:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:07:45
LEAH BREW So, I, I do truly believe in umm… that act, actualizing tendency. 

00:07:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure, sure. So, if you're casting is affected with a client, what do you want to see happen? 

00:07:55
LEAH BREW Umm… Insight! 

00:08:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:00
LEAH BREW …but not insight like, oh, now I understand what happens… 

00:08:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:08:05
LEAH BREW …to me insight umm… like in the (inaudible )adlerian way is a cognitive, emotional, behavioral, spiritual shift. 

00:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:08:15
LEAH BREW It's like umm… the ground has shifted and there's a whole new way of being as a result of that insight. 

00:08:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like a holistic, more holistic insight, right? 

00:08:25
LEAH BREW Yeah, yeah. Not just above the neck kind of insight, it has to have the heart with it. 

00:08:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, so if it, if it effective (inaudible )all kind sounds like your client would begin to have some that insight across different kind of, kind of modes. 

00:08:40
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:08:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:40
LEAH BREW They begin to see the world differently… 

00:08:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:45
LEAH BREW …I love the umm… attachment research… 

00:08:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:08:45
LEAH BREW …that says umm… like securely attached people respond to their environment… 

00:08:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:08:55
LEAH BREW …and severely insecurely attached people react… 

00:08:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's right. 

00:08:55
LEAH BREW …and that's what I see is a shift from reacting with this same set of assumptions… 

00:09:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:05
LEAH BREW …and letting those assumptions go and responding to what's going on in their life in a, in the moment… 

00:09:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:09:10
LEAH BREW …like not responding to all the past traumas or all the past history but like this is what's happening right here and right now and then… 

00:09:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:20
LEAH BREW …people can do that really well they're very capable of doing that… 

00:09:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:09:20
LEAH BREW …and they can clean out the past. 

00:09:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Do you use in up (inaudible )measures in your work that show that, that's been effective with at the clients, or counselors working or… 

00:09:30
LEAH BREW Umm… informally. 

00:09:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:35
LEAH BREW So there's, there's a couple of ways that I do that with umm… with I guess my Gestalt way of being every four sessions or so… 

00:09:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:45
LEAH BREW …I'll check in with them and say, "How are we doing?" 

00:09:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:50
LEAH BREW Are we moving in the direction you want to move? 

00:09:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:09:50
LEAH BREW Umm… What's working in what we're doing is there something different you'd like. 

00:09:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:55
LEAH BREW …So I always take maybe fifteen minutes at the end of a session every four to six weeks. In addition to that umm… what I'm doing EMDR, they have a measurements umm… I've like on a scale from zero to ten how disturbing is this for you? 

00:10:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:10:10
LEAH BREW So, from week to week we, we measure how that's changing… 

00:10:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:10:15
LEAH BREW …and I like umm… I used to be really I don't know negatively reactive toward over measurement. 

00:10:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:10:20
LEAH BREW Umm… But what I've found is in using this Clients can discover that they're making progress… 

00:10:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:30
LEAH BREW …when they weren't aware of that before like they may still feel some distress but if they say, Well, last week you were at a ten and today you're at five that's a, that's a huge jump… 

00:10:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:40
LEAH BREW …what's happening. So that they can see their own growth as well. 

00:10:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like there's an ongoing scaling questions you might use… 

00:10:45
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:10:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …but there's also some (inaudible )which you, which you're open to feedback about the work that you're doing, but you also want to hear maybe how their work is impacting the client if they're kind of getting what they hope to get… 

00:10:55
LEAH BREW Exactly. 

00:10:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …but they'll do that quite often to kind of make sure that you're tailoring, kind of what you're doing… 

00:11:00
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:11:00
LEAH BREW I mean towards their needs are… 

00:11:00
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:11:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And you mentioned that, that you train counselors, and I know that you your counselor educator and I'm wondering what's important to you in terms of what you want your counselor that's your trainees to know? 

00:11:15
LEAH BREW Umm… So the first thing I believe is that you have… 

00:11:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Just more than one person… 

00:11:20
LEAH BREW Yeah, there's more than one. You have to be a healthy person. 

00:11:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:20
LEAH BREW You've got to work on your own issues. 

00:11:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:25
LEAH BREW Umm… We all have something to… my assumption is I start with look we're all a little bit crazy in some way. 

00:11:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:11:30
LEAH BREW There's no such thing as Perfect, perfectly healthy ever maybe it existed I don't know but I've never seen it. 

00:11:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:11:35
LEAH BREW So, the assumption is we start with we all have something to work on. 

00:11:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:11:40
LEAH BREW And that we need to know what that is. 

00:11:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:45
LEAH BREW And so I as… I create homework assignments around having them stir up their issues… 

00:11:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:11:50
LEAH BREW …so that they know that they can emerge so it doesn't come up in counter transference. 

00:11:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:11:55
LEAH BREW And I also believe that they have to be a healthy instrument… 

00:12:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
LEAH BREW …in order to be able to receive the Client well. 

00:12:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:05
LEAH BREW So, I know for example if I'm in a bad space in my life I can't be as present or… 

00:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:12:10
LEAH BREW …umm… attend or take care of other people if I'm not taking care of myself. 

00:12:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:15
LEAH BREW So there's that piece around umm…taking care of their emotional psychological health… 

00:12:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:20
LEAH BREW …and then there's just general self care like exercising and sleeping well… 

00:12:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:25
LEAH BREW …and eating right… 

00:12:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:12:25
LEAH BREW … umm… because I really think we use our bodies to get information. 

00:12:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:12:30
LEAH BREW In order to give that back to clients and we need to be safe. 

00:12:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:12:35
LEAH BREW Umm… and then the other piece in addition to their own work and self care umm… they I guess combined with that is that they have to be good with all of their emotions. 

00:12:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:12:45
LEAH BREW So my, my Gestalt bias is that we have the potential to be any kind of person, we can be kind and loving, we can be ugly and hateful, we can be umm… very rigid and, and determined or we can be very flexible and open… 

00:13:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:13:00
LEAH BREW …and we can feel all feelings and that all feelings are acceptable. 

00:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:13:05
LEAH BREW …how they're expressed isn't always acceptable but, but allowing ourselves to own our feelings and expressing them in a healthy way… 

00:13:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:13:15
LEAH BREW …I think is really, really important. So, in my beginning classes umm… I really try to facilitate umm… their own emotional awareness and where they're cut off… 

00:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:13:25
LEAH BREW …and try to open those pieces up… 

00:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:13:25
LEAH BREW …because if say for example they're not good with anger then they're going to shut down their clients anger. 

00:13:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:13:30
LEAH BREW Or if they're not good with sadness they're going to shut down their client sadness, so they have to be able to feel everything and that's what I really try to facilitate in the beginning is that you've got to be able to feel all of your own stuff… 

00:13:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:13:45
LEAH BREW …to help clients with (inaudible ) 

00:13:47
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So, it's like there's a real emphasis on, on kind of soft awareness, the idea that in a way that we're all growing toward something… 

00:13:50
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …we've got to figure out what we're growing towards and where we were growing from in other ways and I really like what you said about the health aspect well, it's not just being healthy when it's really self care so you survive our work which is tough work but I agree to say that you got to be healthy to be more in tuned… 

00:14:05
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:14:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …if you're not healthy then aspects of kind of taking information get blocked off… 

00:14:10
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:14:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON … right, so as a better instrument as a person we need to be kind of working… 

00:14:15
LEAH BREW Constantly. 

00:14:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …right body spirit across the border itself. 

00:14:20
LEAH BREW Yeah, constantly working on ourselves… 

00:14:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. And I, and like constantly right so it isn't just your first semester or your first year in grad school or when right it's a constant process. 

00:14:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, I'm fifteen years post degree of my doctorate and I'm still working on myself. 

00:14:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

00:14:35
LEAH BREW Not that I don't take vacations from time to time… 

00:14:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:14:35
LEAH BREW … but for the most part I'm trying to… 

00:14:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:14:40
LEAH BREW …always be a better healthier person. 

00:14:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. So, we're the counseling as we as the process and this program we're featuring called that first stage or first step which is building the treatment alliance. 

00:14:50
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:14:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What do you consider building treatment alliance? 

00:14:55
LEAH BREW Umm… I know I've done it well if the clients talk about vulnerable… 

00:15:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hmm… 

00:15:05
LEAH BREW …topics. 

00:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:05
LEAH BREW Umm… If I feel a lack of… I guess the walls between us begin to melt away. 

00:15:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:10
LEAH BREW …right, in a Gestalt umm… turn they have the layers of the onion, right… 

00:15:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

00:15:15
LEAH BREW … and so there's the being kind of phony in the beginning… 

00:15:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:15:20
LEAH BREW …which is polite and appropriate… 

00:15:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:15:20
LEAH BREW So, when that melts away and they can be more authentic and expressive, it feels palpable to me… 

00:15:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:25
LEAH BREW …when there's a wall and so when I feel that wall melts. 

00:15:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:30
LEAH BREW Umm… I feel like we've established a good therapeutic alliance. 

00:15:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:15:35
LEAH BREW Umm… From a place that they feel safe enough… 

00:15:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:15:40
LEAH BREW …to look at things that umm… are kind of scary for them. 

00:15:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's sound like I guess some might write about that as aspect of like the real relationships like you'd feel something real between you and your client, the client would begin, obviously there must be some signs, some, some green lights or the client wouldn't be vulnerable. 

00:15:55
LEAH BREW Right. 

00:15:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, they've got to let down some of their barriers or maybe lean into the process. 

00:16:00
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:16:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And that give you the indications that things are going well. 

00:16:05
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:16:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. What are some keys to success at this stage when you first kind of build these relationships with clients? 

00:16:10
LEAH BREW I would say warmth… 

00:16:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, warmth. 

00:16:10
LEAH BREW … right, you need to exude warmth… 

00:16:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:15
LEAH BREW …umm… and unconditional positive regard meaning I'm not going to judge anything that they say… 

00:16:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, okay. 

00:16:20
LEAH BREW like I, I don't care if they murdered somebody last week although fortunately I've never been tested with that… 

00:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:16:25
LEAH BREW …but umm… I'm not going to judge that… 

00:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:25
LEAH BREW …because I really believe that when people umm… make choices that are harmful to themselves or others. 

00:16:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:35
LEAH BREW They're doing the best that they can. 

00:16:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:35
LEAH BREW So I really feel like I'm being nonjudgmental. 

00:16:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:40
LEAH BREW Umm… And I'm using empathic statements… 

00:16:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:40
LEAH BREW …and my definition of empathy is I'm reflecting their feelings and validating their experience like, 'I get it'. I get it beyond just the content of what they're saying… 

00:16:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:16:50
LEAH BREW … I get the experience of it. Umm… And then that I'm being me, right… 

00:16:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:00
LEAH BREW …I'm not trying to fake being if I'm not doing well, I'll tell a client having a kind of bad day. So if I'm a little off today. So I'm, I'm genuine in that way or if I'm was reacting or responding to something I might bring that into the session and… 

00:17:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:10
LEAH BREW …bring myself into it so that's, that's my authenticity. 

00:17:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:15
LEAH BREW Umm… And that I'm trustworthy. 

00:17:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:20
LEAH BREW Right. Umm… So all of those pieces I, I really think umm… are critical in establishing that umm… foundation for us to do the harder work. 

00:17:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, it's sound like there's, there's the core conditions. 

00:17:35
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:17:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… But it's also the other aspect of your but you, so you're trying to create a certain kind of, kind of a space for counseling then there again I'm going to use that word tune that again, like you're tuned with who you are, what's going on with you and there's some transparency… 

00:17:45
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:17:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …in that so that the relationship you're building is a, is a real relationship, true relationship. 

00:17:50
LEAH BREW Yes. And I let them in on what I'm doing. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:55
LEAH BREW Right. So, well, at the end of a… an in take… 

00:18:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:00
LEAH BREW …sort of the intake portion of the session… 

00:18:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:00
LEAH BREW …not the part where they tell me what brings them to therapy. 

00:18:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:18:05
LEAH BREW But the part right before that… 

00:18:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:05
LEAH BREW …I asked them what do you think your role is and what do you think my role is? 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:10
LEAH BREW … And then I, I tell them what I think my role is… 

00:18:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:10
LEAH BREW …and what I think their role is… 

00:18:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:15
LEAH BREW …and I think it helps us get on the same page. 

00:18:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:15
LEAH BREW …about where we're going… 

00:18:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:20
LEAH BREW …and to make sure that, that we can work well together. 

00:18:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yep, you are… I think of talk about that before as like the tasks of therapy right. 

00:18:25
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:18:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON My role, your role this or we're going to do, rely little around that… 

00:18:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, I'm not going to give you advice… 

00:18:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:30
LEAH BREW …I'm not going to tell you, you should leave that relationship or leave that job… 

00:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:18:35
LEAH BREW …That's, that's not my… 

00:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:18:35
LEAH BREW …I believe you have the answer in you… 

00:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:18:40
LEAH BREW …and than I just have to help you discover it. 

00:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, yes that helps the expectations so there's some way is expecting you to tell them all those things they know that's not going to happen and… 

00:18:45
LEAH BREW Right. 

00:18:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. So some people believe that building therapeutic alliance is the most critical stage that in some ways this doesn't happen well, counseling doesn't happen, change doesn't happen, is that how you see this too? 

00:19:00
LEAH BREW It depends on what you're doing. 

00:19:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, yeah. 

00:19:00
LEAH BREW Right. So, I think there are some ways where people simply need to be grounded… 

00:19:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:19:10
LEAH BREW …like they're in such as the right description as a… in a traumatic state, umm… anxious state or overly emotional state that there's some grounding… 

00:19:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:20
LEAH BREW …and I don't know that the grounding uh… requires an intensely strong therapeutic relationship. 

00:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:30
LEAH BREW But I think that in order to make real ongoing change… 

00:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:30
LEAH BREW …that like the insight that I am looking for… 

00:19:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:19:35
LEAH BREW …umm… that is absolutely essential and required. 

00:19:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:19:40
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:19:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So some ways you're saying that there could be some skill development or they as it might happen, you know, if, if the alliance isn't kind of, kind of perfect in some ways initially but if you want to get to the deeper work or, or maybe depth work or just something which is more to it… 

00:19:55
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:19:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …you know, you're really going to have to kind of put in the work with, with these building blocks and build a good kind of relationship. 

00:20:00
LEAH BREW Yeah, to me it's like, if you, are you, if you, if you're working on just changing… 

00:20:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:05
LEAH BREW …symptoms you have to have a good enough relationship. 

00:20:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:20:05
LEAH BREW But if you want to actually change the problem… 

00:20:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:10
LEAH BREW that requires… 

00:20:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:20:10
LEAH BREW …more relationship. 

00:20:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Leah, how do you how do you tailor your work for different people? 

00:20:20
LEAH BREW Umm… In some ways I do and in some ways I don't. 

00:20:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. (inaudible )about that, yeah. 

00:20:25
LEAH BREW So, umm… diversity as you could tell from the beginning of my experience, own experience… 

00:20:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:30
LEAH BREW …is a really important. 

00:20:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:20:30
LEAH BREW Umm…Part of the way I frame… 

00:20:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:20:35
LEAH BREW …my work so I believe that we're all cultural beings. 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:20:40
LEAH BREW Umm…And our culture is multifaceted… 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:20:40
LEAH BREW …it's not just race and ethnicity. It's gender social class umm… a factual orientation. 

00:20:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:20:45
LEAH BREW …uh… all of the different things that we can be our religious upbringing, where we were raised, was it in the south of, in New York wherever. And I can textualize the way I understand the client through that umm… cultural frame. So I can try to understand their world better… 

00:21:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:21:10
LEAH BREW …by trying to study their culture better… 

00:21:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:21:10
LEAH BREW …know their culture better. But the work that I do is no different. 

00:21:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:15
LEAH BREW I'm going to still be empathic, I'm going to still umm… try to facilitate insight, I would do in EMD, EMDR in trauma… 

00:21:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:21:20
LEAH BREW …regardless of the clients culture but the cultures are really critical part in me understanding their perspective well because I feel like if I don't get them, well enough, then I, I can't help them. 

00:21:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, it's sounds like in some ways or presence is the same thing kind of like who you are is, is the same but as you get to know the client and kind of what's important for them then you begin to adapt and kind of work with, with what they can kind of take in, what they can hear, what feels important to them… 

00:21:50
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:21:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. So in just a moment we're going to see you work and we're in a see you kind of work uh… with two clients and we're going to see do enactments uh… for both clients in first session. You've given us a lot to think about in terms of kind of your presence or things, things you, things you want to do, umm… and we'll look for that and kind of see how you are able to kind of build, build these relationships. 

00:22:15
LEAH BREW Okay, sounds good. 

00:22:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

00:22:20
Assessment Strategies 

00:22:20
Being Present 

00:22:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, why is being present so important. 

00:22:30
LEAH BREW Umm… If you're not present, you can't hear. 

00:22:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Well, that's true. 

00:22:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, I think umm… if my mind is distracted with something else I really can't focus on the client and I think that client can feel that. 

00:22:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hmm… So, it's, it's about kind of, kind of listening better and hearing better, what kind of skills are involved with that? 

00:22:45
LEAH BREW Umm… I have to prepare myself before every session. 

00:22:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:22:50
LEAH BREW . I need to umm… even if it's just for thirty seconds to take a few deep breaths… 

00:22:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:22:55
LEAH BREW …and I wanted do visualization to sort of cleanse myself or whatever might be going on… 

00:23:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:23:00
LEAH BREW …if I'm rushing I, I always try to umm… show up to my sessions at least a half hour before the session… 

00:23:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:23:10
LEAH BREW …in fifteen minutes at a minimum. Umm… So that I cannot feel rushed when I sit down. 

00:23:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, you're, you're making yourself present to becoming present before you can see that client. 

00:23:20
LEAH BREW Exactly. 

00:23:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And so that when you sit down with a client and ready to go, you're there… 

00:23:25
LEAH BREW There my whole world. 

00:23:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:30
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON How do you cultivate and develop that, that skill in this I think that's a skill, so how do you get to the point you can do that? 

00:23:35
LEAH BREW Umm… I think first umm… I have to be comfortable with myself, right. 

00:23:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:23:40
LEAH BREW …and what I've done is I, I do a little bit of mindfulness and meditation. 

00:23:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:45
LEAH BREW So, I think that really… 

00:23:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:23:50
LEAH BREW …helps me be present. 

00:23:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:23:50
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:23:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON How do you think clients know that your present or how do you know that you're present too? 

00:23:55
LEAH BREW Well, I know that I'm present because I'm actually listening to them… 

00:24:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:00
LEAH BREW …and my mind isn't wandering in some other direction… 

00:24:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:00
LEAH BREW …like oh I'm hungry or like I make sure to go use the restroom before going, you know… 

00:24:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:05
LEAH BREW …all the little things… 

00:24:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:24:05
LEAH BREW …make sure I'm not too hung. So I can really focus on them. Umm… So that's how I know because I'm listening and I think they know because umm… they feel safe, they feel heard. 

00:24:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:15
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

00:24:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, you're sounds like you're, you're reading yourself… 

00:24:20
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:24:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and then you're also to reading the client in terms of how to how they're responding to you. 

00:24:25
LEAH BREW Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:25
LEAH BREW And in fact all when I discover, when I'm not present because that certainly happens from time to time. I'll have to like take a deep breath and adjust myself internally to make sure I'm back with the client. 

00:24:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, in just a moment we're going to see you work with Carla… 

00:24:40
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:24:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …and this is the first time that you've seen her. What should our viewers kind of focus on or look at it as you see this? 

00:24:50
LEAH BREW Umm… Partially, my body language… 

00:24:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:55
LEAH BREW umm… which I try to sit in a way that's open… 

00:24:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:24:55
LEAH BREW …umm… because I do find if I would across my arms and legs that I actually feel blocked off from my clients and then and then what I'm saying… 

00:25:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:25:05
LEAH BREW …that I'm really trying to listen not just to the words but the meaning behind what they're saying so my responses. 

00:25:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Let's watch 

00:25:15
LEAH BREW Alright. Hi Carla! 

00:25:20
CARLA Hi. 

00:25:20
LEAH BREW So, what brings you in today? 

00:25:25
CARLA Well, that's a must we just ended. And then feeling really afraid of like how I did all the row and, and feeling like I could have done a lot better. Umm… Some kind of struggling with feeling, you know, like I performed well and maybe I may fail or just a lot of different thoughts in regards to how I did the semester. 

00:25:50
LEAH BREW You're worried, you failed? 

00:25:55
CARLA I mean I have to get grades… 

00:25:55
LEAH BREW Okay. 

00:25:55
CARLA …and I do consistently well. But, yeah I'm, I'm still worried that, I don't know, afraid. 

00:26:05
LEAH BREW You're scared of not doing well enough. 

00:26:10
CARLA Yeah, I am. I, I feel like I really push myself to perform a certain way I feel like, you know, if I don't get an A, it's a bad thing, like if I get B pluses it's, it's fine but somehow to me it's still kind of a disappointment. 

00:26:30
LEAH BREW So you expect yourself to earn A's? 

00:26:30
CARLA I do, yeah. I mean, I think that because I've always tried to be a good student and when it does like when my work doesn't really pull through, I'm kind of like, okay, well, there's something that I did wrong or maybe I'm not as good as I thought it was. 

00:26:55
LEAH BREW It, it seems like umm… an A is the only acceptable grade that you can earn and otherwise you're not good enough. 

00:27:10
CARLA Yeah, yeah, I mean sometimes I even wonder like okay. I'm merely fit to be a grade student and like I said I done consistently well but I still feel like okay like, next semester it's probably best semester were like I'd fail terribly and, you know, (inaudible )for sure that it was a bad decision to come into grad school. 

00:27:35
LEAH BREW A bad decision. 

00:27:40
CARLA Or maybe not on my part, might like the professors part, or you know letting me into that school. 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
LEAH BREW It's, it's you're laughing, I'm laughing with you because there's this absurdity to it, right. 

00:28:00
CARLA Yeah, it's kind of silly. 

00:28:00
LEAH BREW It's a little bit absurd that you feel like such an imposture. And yet there's something very real and scary about not being good enough. 

00:28:10
CARLA Yeah. Yeah, it's really scary I mean like when it's time to set and get work done. I feel like it does take me quite a while to like write a paper.. 

00:28:20
LEAH BREW Hmm… 

00:28:20
CARLA …or you know, buckle down study like it's difficult for me… 

00:28:25
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:28:25
CARLA …but I really push myself and at the same time like I doubt my any work like if I spend, if I spend an hour working on an introduction for a paper… 

00:28:35
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:28:40
CARLA …I'll be done with the paper feel good about it and then I turn it in and I'll be like, 'Oh, my gosh! What if that totally suck like I forgot whatever down, let me go back and look at it like maybe this is the paper that will like show the professor that I'm not fit or I'm not performing as well as they should be. 

00:28:55
LEAH BREW You have a lot of self-doubt. Where does that come from? 

00:29:05
CARLA I mean I don't know. I guess I've never really thought about it too much. I am the first person in my family to graduate from college. So I do feel like that put a lot of pressure on myself to do well and represent my family. 

00:29:20
LEAH BREW Ah… to represent your family. So you aren't just trying to do well for you. You're trying to make your family feel proud. 

00:29:30
CARLA Yeah, yeah. 

00:29:30
LEAH BREW Yes, you feel a lot of responsibility there. 

00:29:35
CARLA Yeah, I mean my parents don't know what I'm working on half the time but they know that, you know, Oh, you know, you'll do well, you always do well but to me it's kind of like no, I know I have to really try hard. 

00:29:45
LEAH BREW Umm… 

00:29:50
CARLA So I do I put a lot of pressure on myself. 

00:29:50
LEAH BREW Yeah. It sounds like you know more than your parents put on you. 

00:29:55
CARLA Yeah, they don't really care too much. 

00:29:55
LEAH BREW Yeah, so this is self-imposed. 

00:30:00
CARLA Yeah. 

00:30:00
LEAH BREW Somewhere you have a belief that you must do the best, not just well because well could be an A minus or B plus but the best. 

00:30:10
CARLA Yeah. 

00:30:15
LEAH BREW Or you disappoint… your disappointment of your family, maybe it's the right word not to your family because they aren't concerned about it… 

00:30:25
CARLA Uh-huh. 

00:30:25
LEAH BREW …but not representing well. 

00:30:30
CARLA Yeah. I know they've thought better that way. Yeah, because they don't pressure me to go to school and get good grades, they don't but I feel like somehow I still feel like I have to do that to the present (ph) you know, come so we can (inaudible ) 

00:30:50
LEAH BREW Yeah, you're kind of mystified where that comes from? Why you put so much pressure on yourself? 

00:30:55
CARLA Yeah. 

00:30:55
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:30:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Leah, is this, is this a typical way that you are with clients and you as a… how present you are? 

00:31:00
LEAH BREW I think so, umm… at least to the degree that there are cameras rolling and… 

00:31:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:10
LEAH BREW …umm… other distractions I mean I… I probably sit a little more comfortably… 

00:31:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:15
LEAH BREW …I've… I'm was sitting probably more formally like I am right now. 

00:31:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:15
LEAH BREW Umm… but mostly I think… 

00:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah.. 

00:31:20
LEAH BREW …I was like 90 % there… 

00:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:20
LEAH BREW …and being present with her. 

00:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, again with all the distractions for yourself for that you aware these distractions and you're moving a lot of your, your consciousness so you really focus on the client who's, who's right in front of you. 

00:31:35
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:31:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:35
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:31:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what do we see you doing in the segment what were you doing? 

00:31:35
LEAH BREW Umm… I was really trying to understand umm… what it was that was most bother for… some for her. 

00:31:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:45
LEAH BREW So, lots of students feel imposter syndromes… 

00:31:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:31:50
LEAH BREW Umm… but, but everybody's experience of that is unique. 

00:31:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:31:55
LEAH BREW Umm… so trying to figure out what is it about her… 

00:31:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:32:00
LEAH BREW Umm… so I was trying to just really listen to those pieces and, and to keep myself focused on her. 

00:32:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that you were really focused, your, your body looked that way, your tone, your tone was very soft it was really kind of focus on her and you know your pacing also was, was, was such that I've almost felt like when you put the same together you're almost like holding her. 

00:32:20
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

00:32:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like you're holding her in that space, yeah. 

00:32:25
LEAH BREW I am, I feel like umm… I'm giving them a big hug, right like I'm trying to create a hug a feeling energy in the room, that's exactly it. 

00:32:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Did you sense that was happening to as she was kind of going to talk and pack and… 

00:32:40
LEAH BREW Yeah, over time… 

00:32:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:32:40
LEAH BREW … and there was a shift somewhere along that I saw her relax into what she was talking about. 

00:32:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so that… that's the feedback you're reading about that this kind of working or making that connection. 

00:32:50
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:32:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Why don't we move to our next skill which is called the use of open body language which is being warm, open and accepting. 

00:33:05
Assessment Strategies 

00:33:05
Use of Open Body Language/ 

00:33:05
Being Warm, Open And Accepting 

00:33:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Leah, why is being warm, open and accepting so critical at this stage? 

00:33:20
LEAH BREW Umm… in order for people to talk about vulnerable things… 

00:33:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
LEAH BREW …umm… the environment needs, needs to feel safe. 

00:33:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
LEAH BREW And if I'm cold or judging in any way then they're going to, they're going to moderate or temper what they say… 

00:33:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:35
LEAH BREW …and I want them to be able to feel free to say umm… the unspeakable. 

00:33:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So that I hear you say that there is it warm, and it's open but it's accepting as well so that whatever the client says here it's okay. 

00:33:50
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:33:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Are you just being you when you do this or you doing more than that, and is your skill involved here is this is your personality or you always this way? 

00:34:00
LEAH BREW Umm… It's a complicated question. So, I think it's a small kid I have always been empathic… 

00:34:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:05
LEAH BREW …that I picked up other people's energy. 

00:34:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:15
LEAH BREW …and I as a coping mechanism and because of my own cultural upbringing… 

00:34:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:34:20
LEAH BREW …shut off everything… 

00:34:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:34:20
LEAH BREW …and disconnected. When I came into this profession I had to remove that barrier to get back in touch with myself. 

00:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:30
LEAH BREW So umm… when I'm, is it me, yes and it's not me. 

00:34:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:34:35
LEAH BREW So, I'm not this way with everybody all the time… 

00:34:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You're not. 

00:34:35
LEAH BREW …exhausting… 

00:34:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:34:40
LEAH BREW …to be that present… 

00:34:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right, right. 

00:34:40
LEAH BREW …to be that focused and attentive umm… but certainly when people are in crisis and in therapy it I just go there… 

00:34:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:45
LEAH BREW …like that just happens. So in that way it is me it's just not me all the time. 

00:34:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That sounds like you have it and some ways uh… and orientation or a trade in some ways that allows you to do this but when you sit with clients it's almost more focused and you kind of you're really taking those skills and use them in a certain way. 

00:35:05
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:35:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. How do you tailor this to match the client's own kind of background or presentation? 

00:35:10
LEAH BREW Umm… So gender is a huge difference for me. 

00:35:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:35:15
LEAH BREW Umm…I will have maybe less personal space with other women. 

00:35:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:20
LEAH BREW …and create a little more space with most men. 

00:35:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:25
LEAH BREW umm…because I don't want anything to ever be misunderstood. 

00:35:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:30
LEAH BREW umm… but otherwise I think I'm probably the same with everybody in terms of my warmth and openness. 

00:35:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:35:40
LEAH BREW Adjust me sit further back. 

00:35:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it's sound like going that be reading, reading the client and taking that in… 

00:35:45
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON …you know, some ways it's, it's different flavor of the same thing based on what you're reading. 

00:35:50
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:35:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. So in just a moment we're going to see you work with, with Cesar. 

00:35:55
LEAH BREW Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… It's his first session, first time seeing you. What should we look for? 

00:36:00
LEAH BREW So one of the things that I've been told is that I mirror the person I'm, I'm talking with and oddly… 

00:36:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hmm… 

00:36:05
LEAH BREW …the first person who I didn't even know I was doing this as the first person who discovered it was my dad and I was doing it with like this total stranger… 

00:36:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:36:15
LEAH BREW …and he said you were changing your tone of voice and you were changing your body language… 

00:36:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah, okay, okay. 

00:36:20
LEAH BREW …and so umm… I'm guessing that will happen again because I feel like when I'm, I'm literally trying to resonate to them so you might see some visual mirroring. 

00:36:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:30
LEAH BREW Umm… and then how I use my voice might be another piece. 

00:36:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So there's mirroring, there's the voice and then the last piece was how are you accepting like so how… which we, which we are you going to something you cannot judge, you just going to hear what he has to say… 

00:36:45
LEAH BREW Right. I, I don't umm… I don't actually feel any judgment… 

00:36:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:50
LEAH BREW …which is wonderful I mean if I feel judgment ever in a session… 

00:36:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:55
LEAH BREW …I know that's work I need to do… 

00:36:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:00
LEAH BREW Umm… I really feel umm… that whatever people's experience are is completely is, it's completely acceptable. 

00:37:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So, we'll see if you got to focus on his experience. 

00:37:05
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:37:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Let's watch. 

00:37:10
LEAH BREW Umm… So tell me what brings you in today? 

00:37:15
CESAR Yeah, umm… the reason I'm coming in today is because umm… my relationship umm… just ended recently and I'm uh… really hurt by it and confused and really wanting some help. 

00:37:30
LEAH BREW You say the relationship ended, doesn't? Tell me more about that. 

00:37:35
CESAR Yeah. Umm… We were together uh… a short period of time for about two months and umm… we had been best friends for a year and a half, all together. Umm… We actually known each other since high school and umm… towards the end I, a sort of feeling uh… alone umm… and I ended the relationship with her. 

00:38:05
LEAH BREW You've lost not just your girlfriend but you lost your best friend. 

00:38:05
CESAR Yeah. 

00:38:10
LEAH BREW Yeah, I can see why you're feeling hurt. Umm… Tell me about what ended that relationship? Why, why you decided to end it? 

00:38:15
CESAR Right. Umm… So the reason why I did the relationship was because I was feeling umm… a little confused of where we're going to take this relationship. Umm… We both agreed that we were going to move forward and I thought that looked like umm… where we would be hanging out with our families and spending all the time and for her it was more. I don't want to spend as much time with each other and I want to backpedal whatever I'm going through I just want to talk to God or something about their problems they were… she didn't want to talk to me about whatever she was going through so. I was really pissed off that. You know we would go to each other maybe when we were best friends and now, she wasn't coming to me anymore. 

00:39:10
LEAH BREW You were feeling really pushed away. 

00:39:10
CESAR Yeah, I, I felt like she had put her hand between me and her. And I was just so confused and upset… 

00:39:20
LEAH BREW Ah, that's so a powerful gesture you did there. 

00:39:20
CESAR Uh-huh. 

00:39:25
LEAH BREW Yeah, just I could feel that distance. You must have been feeling. 

00:39:30
CESAR Yeah. 

00:39:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, and so you're really missing her and feeling sad. 

00:39:40
CESAR Yeah. Yeah, I, I miss her a lot, I, I don't know I'm like uh… this hard spot right now. You know part of me wants to collar and see if we can work things out. Umm… another part of me so just let it go and move on, umm… not sure. 

00:39:55
LEAH BREW Yeah, you're feeling embezzling (ph) about your decision now. 

00:40:00
CESAR Yeah. 

00:40:00
LEAH BREW Yeah, yeah, I imagine it would be hard to lose such a close friend. 

00:40:05
CESAR That's the hard part. You know she's my best friend and we talk to each other everything and she knows everything about me and I miss that I… you know these last two weeks we really haven't talked at all, it was just weird not hearing from her and… 

00:40:25
LEAH BREW Your face really lit up as you thought about the connection that you shared with her. 

00:40:30
CESAR Yeah. 

00:40:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, I can see that now, yeah. 

00:40:35
CESAR I'm, I'm missed that part and uh… that's the part that I really loved in the relationship that we were still present we were always with each other we're always talking through out the day. And then towards the end I. the communication just lasted like may be one or two comments through out the day and I aren't sitting here for more as much 

00:40:50
LEAH BREW Sounds like your not you not sure about why she was distaining… distancing herself from you. 

00:41:00
CESAR Yeah, she wanted to take it slow and when she said that, I didn't know what that meant, So I asked her what is so me like tell me more 'cause to me taken it's slow is like as long as we are acknowledging that we are moving forward. She wanted to take it slow and just in the sense like just cut me off and push me away. I mean that's what I was feeling inside. 

00:41:25
LEAH BREW You had really clear ideas about wanting to move forward in the relationship, it sounds like you're not interested and just dating around, but that you're looking for something more serious. 

00:41:35
CESAR Yeah I'm 32 years old, I wanna settle down. 

00:41:40
LEAH BREW Yeah! You're laughing about that, so I'm kinda interested as if 32 years old is old for not being married. 

00:41:50
CESAR All right yeah, it just feels like every relationship that I've had, it's get harder each time when it ends 'cause that I'm thinking am I ever gonna have family, am I gonna have a the dog, the (inaudible ) kids, I don't even know (inaudible ) means, but just like a dog and this perfect life, I don't even know what perfect means but just this view of what it's (inaudible ) every time a relationship ends and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed in knowing that I have to start over again and I don't like that. 

00:42:25
LEAH BREW Yeah you're really eager to establish your own family. Yeah. 

00:42:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Leah it just a pretty good, good example of how you do this. 

00:42:35
LEAH BREW Yeah I think it is. 

00:42:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Tell me more about that in terms of kind of, you know being warm open accepting… Your body language was very open, and you've seen with the first time. What you where aware when your win hm? 

00:42:45
LEAH BREW So the first thing I wanted to do was actually feel comfortable in my body. 

00:42:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:42:50
LEAH BREW I think about okay how do I want my hands, how do I want my feet. Do I feel open, So I was, I was really working on that internally and then I was trying to read him and match him, and sort of preparing my self for what ever emerges. 

00:43:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I never see, your really watching (inaudible ) like mean. You are watching him without watching him. Like you know your really in tune with him, your tone matches his tone, and there's a moment in which you know that marrying you know he kinda like had a force like push, you know when I saw you kinda of mirror that path, What was going on there? 

00:43:30
LEAH BREW So it, it was very powerful when he said, you know I felt her… like she was pushing me back and I was like, I felt that, I was like woah! Wow, so I wanted him to feel that more, more and if you know Eugine Glennin(ph) work with focusing. It's really powerful to sometimes get that back. 

00:43:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:43:55
LEAH BREW So I wanted to resonate with that and enhance that feeling for him, and to let him know that I get it like Wow that is oouch. 

00:44:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, Yeah it's funny 'cause he kinda of did that, and you did that and his (inaudible ) back was offff… 

00:44:07
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

00:44:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Seem like he did feel that, like he felt something different in that moment. 

00:44:10
LEAH BREW Yeah I think it helped him feel it even more. 

00:44:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. How were you accepting of him? In that session. 

00:44:20
LEAH BREW Umm… I did feel any judgment, toward what he was saying, I really wanted to understand, why he kept ending relationships? 

00:44:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON okay, yeah. 

00:44:30
LEAH BREW Why he was ending this relationship, uh… because he ended it. 

00:44:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:44:35
LEAH BREW Felt regret for, so there is an interesting sort of perspective, just really trying to understand where it's coming from more than anything else, yeah. 

00:44:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, as I was saying as, it seemed like you were really trying to understand, what his experience was, what was going on, and any kind of sad like. This ran on my life, you know and he kinda of began to talk to you about what his experience was like I wanted if he… has a new conservation for him some where, and then real people judge him, who is really never been able to impact this may be as a guy or this guy friends, but with you he was able to talk about some of his deeper motivation and needs. 

00:45:15
LEAH BREW Yeah. And I also thing there is a cultural pressures too right, because with in a Latino's families and he is Latino, the importance of family is so important, and it's not just your family of origin, but the family that you create like you're a man once you have that. So, I was aware of that possibly being contributing factor to him feeling the pressure but I also have to think there was more to it. 

00:45:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so your assessing your open to hear more what's going on there. 

00:45:45
LEAH BREW Yeah . 

00:45:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON All right move to our next skill, which is demonstrating empathy. 

00:45:50
LEAH BREW All right. 

00:45:55
Assessment Strategies 

00:45:55
Demonstrating Empathy 

00:46:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Empathy is critical to our work, but why it's so important, at the beginning. 

00:46:05
LEAH BREW Uh… I think it's helps the client to feel understood and seen, I think we human nature is specially for people who are feeling secure, we're terrified to be seen, because we're afraid we're going to be rejected. And so we actually get comfortable with not being understood. 

00:46:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:30
LEAH BREW And I think what makes therapy different and what establishes the tone, of how I'm gonna work is that we're gonna go deep, and we're gonna go quick. 

00:46:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:40
LEAH BREW I'm not gonna mess around with this. So, I'm gonna reflect as deeply as I can possibly see. 

00:46:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:46:45
LEAH BREW In the moment, and establish like I'm safe and I get you, and, and yeah it's okay, yeah. 

00:47:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Are they different types about the… different levels of it? 

00:47:05
LEAH BREW Sure they are differently, different levels of it. 

00:47:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:47:05
LEAH BREW So, with students I find when I train them, they have to be able to just state the obvious in the beginning right, because we don't speak in languages on empathy, this isn't how people talk in any culture as in a normal thing. 

00:47:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:47:20
LEAH BREW So, helping them just to say, you're sad, because you're sad can be really hard for some students to identify 'cause there are cut off from whatever emotions. 

00:47:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:47:30
LEAH BREW So, that's the more superficial level, and it's helpful, it doesn't take a lot, it doesn't go for a deep though. 

00:47:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON okay. 

00:47:40
LEAH BREW So I think, then you have to begin to read, uh…. the inner experience, usually connected to self- esteem, being good enough in some way. Every bodies self-esteem is different, but that kinda of inferiority thing that I've talked about before with that I like that with add we do. We all have our places of inferiority and I think that's the common human experience and so that deeper the inferiority that's, that kind of empathy is most powerful and most facilitating. 

00:48:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, that sounds like there's a aspect where you can nail a feeling or felt the feeling that's like a starting point, but then as you can push through that it sounds like as you understand more of the clients experience and what's going on for them, then you can kinda access different levels kinda of who they are and what's really happening for them. 

00:48:30
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

00:48:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON How is demonstrating empathy, a skill? 

00:48:35
LEAH BREW Well, as I said before, I don't think that we talked, like you feel this, you feel that… That not what we do in our culture, it's not polite to be gushing all over the place with our feeling. Uh… so I think it's a skill because most people just don't do it naturally. 

00:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay 

00:48:50
LEAH BREW Unless for some reason, they got empathy as a child. 

00:48:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah 

00:48:55
LEAH BREW And I kinda see connection between attachment and empathy, So people will secure attachments probably got some empathy, people with insecure attachment doing this as a duality, but I look at a really on a continue one. So the less empathy, you get the less aware you are of your self or we are of our selves, and the more empathy we get, the more that we can listen to our selves and know our selves better, So I think what do they say about 60% people have secure attachments r probably it's the 40% coming to therapy. 

00:49:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. So, sounds like your saying that it's a skill that can be taught and developed but it takes attention, takes what it's not a natural thing necessarily, that even to me ever received it in our cultural society and it's not like want to walking on the street, being empathic to each other all the time. 

00:49:50
LEAH BREW Exactly. It's not just want we do. 

00:49:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, I'm wondering you know, think about that what are the ways, which counters may be mis conveying empathy. 

00:50:00
LEAH BREW Ahem what ever feeling's they don't do well them selves. 

00:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah… okay. 

00:50:05
LEAH BREW Those are the feelings there're gonna miss in the clients. 

00:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:50:10
LEAH BREW So anger and sadness seem to be the two most popular that I noticed among our students. So if the clients starts to get angry and the student is not, or the counselor is not good with anger, then they'll find ways to minimize it, or shut it down or focus on something else. 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Just miss it. 

00:50:25
LEAH BREW Or miss it entirely, and reflect something different. 

00:50:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:50:30
LEAH BREW Or even sadness is the same thing there will try to look on the bright side, or minimize the experiences in some way. 

00:50:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, how is conveying empathy unique may be based on each client's cultural back ground, or cultural experience. 

00:50:45
LEAH BREW I think conveying empathy is the same for me regardless of the client, but um… certain cultures who are not acculturated to dominate US culture, I'll say women more specifically, so women who are more acculturated to US culture will tend to be more emotionally expressive. 

00:51:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:51:10
LEAH BREW And be able to do softer, vulnerable sad emotions more easily, some women can do anger, some women can't. But some women from minority culture, some minority culture's may not emote quite as much like to have the welling apathy of tears in the eyes might be a big stretch. Or for a man I find ah., this isn't true for millennial, for men who are like the baby boom generation, if they well up that's pretty powerful for them, but to see them sob I think that's rarer, than in like with women, from demonic US culture, so I think about not how I am different, but I… I dunno I guess I measure the impact differently based on their own cultural background. 

00:52:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, yeah that makes sense yeah, yeah So in a moment we are gonna see you continue your work with Clara, mind if you can set up kind of this enactment what we're gonna see. 

00:52:15
LEAH BREW So, what I want you to pay attention to are feeling words that I might be using, and some times I'll state them very umm… with confidence, you're feeling this way, and other times I'll do it more tentative, and some times I'll say a little bit because I…. like to use that when I think that they might find the feeling unacceptable. 

00:52:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:52:40
LEAH BREW I might say you're feeling a little bit this way, and that helps people kind of take it in a little bit. 

00:52:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:52:50
LEAH BREW I also look for part, part he feels that way, part he feels that way. 

00:52:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, we'll look for how you navigate that little bit, and if you do kinda push towards deeper empathy kinda how you do that like there's a tentative initially and if you get a grey methin(ph) you might push further with that. 

00:53:05
LEAH BREW Yes. 

00:53:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay Good. 

00:53:10
LEAH BREW So, you were talking about feeling like you needed to represent your family, be a good representative of your family by doing we were in best and I just hear this enormous sense of responsibility. 

00:53:30
CARLA I would say responsibility is a pretty common thing through out you know my life um… currently aside from being a student. I'm pretty responsible with like you know helping around my house or helping my parents, contributing finically as well. So, I do feel like there is that sense of responsibility not only towards my school work but also towards my family, and everything else that I juggle. 

00:54:00
LEAH BREW All right that sounds like your little bit over whelmed with that at times. 

00:54:05
CARLA Yeah I'm I feel like more often then not you know, I'm just rushing through the day, going to school, going to work, going home to be around to help my parents out, or at my practicum site, even making time for my self feels like, you know I'm taking away from other responsibilities that I have at home or school or… 

00:54:30
LEAH BREW And you feel guilty if you take care of yourself. 

00:54:35
CARLA Yes it's really hard to be okay with, you know taking the night off and out, really doing anything just spending time with my fiancée even I feel like may be I should be doing this, or I should be helping out with some thing. 

00:54:55
LEAH BREW You're burdened by a lot of responsibility but I've got to guess that you're responsibility is also source of feeling good about your self. 

00:55:05
CARLA Yeah, I mean there's, there's two parts to it you know toughly right, I do feel like half the time I'm complaining about it, and the other half of the time I really feel good about being able to help my family and have a sense of like I don't know like pride I guess, because you know I'm a student, I work, I try to be the best person I can be for others and for my self so it feels good to you know be able to help. 

00:55:40
LEAH BREW So it seems like at a deeper level you're really proud of yourself or be able to manage so much and to do well in school despite being anxious that you wont, and to help, contribute to your family and why is that a meaningful and important to you, and then at the same time in your day to day life you are stressed out and over whelmed and then want to be able to take care of your self, guilt free. 

00:56:15
CARLA Yeah, yeah I know, I did know that would happen in times you know I mean even with what I mentioned about school like my parents totally really pressure me to have good grades, but at the same time it's like oh there is a family even that you have to attend and I have to do home work and I have to attend this can't think it out or brought these so odd or something to do with family. So, I do feel like if ever I was going to (inaudible ), but I do feel like although as much as I go proud to be able o help them, I just feel like some times you know get it. 

00:56:55
LEAH BREW So, there are times that you, you wish that you could take care of your self without disappointing any one else. 

00:57:10
CARLA Yeah that would be nice without feeling like, you know there is something I need to return to or take care of. 

00:57:20
LEAH BREW Yeah. That's a lot, you feel that like you should lay it all out, taking care of your family and their needs and your responsibility with attending families activities and doing home-work and going to school and giving your fiancée enough and needing self care, uff… how did you filled it all in. 

00:57:45
CARLA Yeah I guess I really don't think about it too much if I did I probably would feel lot more over whelmed and I usually do. 

00:58:00
LEAH BREW Yeah you protect yourself by just being in the moment, and try to take one thing at a time. 

00:58:10
CARLA Yeah. 

00:58:10
LEAH BREW Yeah. So, I kinda of see a connection between um… the responsibility you feel at school, and… almost feels like correct me if I'm wrong like you have to do your best and yet you have to do your best at home, so I'm almost seeing a connection like this habit of contributing at home you have to do your best, and you take that every where you go and in all your environment you have to be the best girl, fiancé you have to be the best student, your eyes are getting bigger, well that's one of an art. 

00:58:50
CARLA yeah, yeah I do push myself, to be the best I can be. But I don't really think to much about what's gonna do for me that kind of pressure that I'm putting on my self, yeah 'cause who knows may be my family would be fine without me and I'm over here like you know going above or beyond to trying to help them and be always present and always taking care of like my parents who are now a lot older and retire and… 

00:59:15
LEAH BREW You just took a whole extreme there so what I'm hearing you say is that you have to be really, really present and to do best as take care of them. Or may be they don't really need you. Right…. Did you hear that? 

00:59:30
CARLA Yeah. 

00:59:35
LEAH BREW That dichotomy, as if it is one or the other, Nah they don't need me at all. What I don't hear is a conservation about some times I can do something's mediocre and that's okay. 

00:59:55
CARLA Yeah I think that's definitely something that I would like to work towards. 

01:00:00
LEAH BREW Yeah you work so hard to always be your best, and you're tired. 

01:00:10
CARLA I am. 

01:00:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Leah is it a good example of demonstrating empathy? 

01:00:15
LEAH BREW Yes, I think it was a great example. 

01:00:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Tell me why. 

01:00:25
LEAH BREW So, we moved kinda of slowly down this path of responsibility starting with school, working and then moving toward family, and… there was a moment where she recognized she had a moment of insight her eyes got big, connecting this idea about be them importance of being responsible in her family, and how that just how she lives her life now, like this isn't just a choice a decision that she makes but rather away of being in life, and that she doesn't know other ways to be. 

01:01:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know I wonder if you're consciously aware of this or not, but when she had that when her eyes opened, what did that mean for you or how do you sense that and what that… you know, in a way how do you go further with that. 

01:01:15
LEAH BREW Well the first thing that I always think of "Yes" I nailed it, I got it. 

01:01:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, you are conscious of it, okay. 

01:01:20
LEAH BREW Yes, I got it and then I think okay, how can we take this further in that moment though after I nailed it part I wanted to sit with it for a moment I wanted to, I watch her eyes get bigger and then come back to normal, I don't wanna break that experience or break that moment, so I use a little bit of silence to allow that to happen. 

01:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah I saw that yeah, you know it was interesting 'cause you, you… carla came in and we were talking about but the difficulty on this responsible in her life then there was kinda of shift, this duality of her responsibility yes it's difficult but there's also a sense of pride that she gets from being so responsible and kinda of being confident good work she does, and I know you kinda push even deeper that sense of pride like connecting with the deeper sense of that has a lot of meaning for her. 

01:02:15
LEAH BREW I think that um… there is a couple of pieces to this, one is I noticed client have either or way of thinking. 

01:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:02:25
LEAH BREW Like this can either be bad or it can be good. 

01:02:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:02:30
LEAH BREW It can't be both. And I really think everything is a both end. Everything can have strengths to it and set backs to it. 

01:02:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right 

01:02:35
LEAH BREW And I wanted her to understand that she was getting something from this. 

01:02:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right 

01:02:40
LEAH BREW like she feels good about herself. And this is a really good way to feel a sense of pride and thinking of it in a Adlerian way, right that striving for significance by taking care of your family that's really a nice thing to do. 

01:02:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:02:55
LEAH BREW So, I wanted her to be able to own that rather then it just kinda be in the back ground I wanted to lay it out on the table, so that she could see it and say yeah this is the good ting and this is why I keep doing it. But what I wanted to do is make a conscious choice about it. 

01:03:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Ah… there we go… 

01:03:15
LEAH BREW Rather than just doing it because this is what she does. 

01:03:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. Why don't I move to our next segment which is called Trusting the client's self actualizing tendencies. 

01:03:25
LEAH BREW Okay. 

01:03:30
Assessment Strategies 

01:03:35
Trusting the client's 

01:03:35
Self-Actualizing tendencies 

01:03:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Leah what do you mean by Self-Actualizing tendencies. 

01:03:40
LEAH BREW I believe that we move in a growth direction. 

01:03:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:03:45
LEAH BREW Just like in physical development where moving along a path I think are emotional, spiritual selves also move in a growth direction toward maturity. 

01:04:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so this one like kinda Rodger and Maslow's idea about growth and okay… How do you explain or convey this to client, 'cause this is kinda of real psychological kinda of term. 

01:04:10
LEAH BREW I don't. 

01:04:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:04:15
LEAH BREW I do explain it to students that I have a bias 'cause not every one owns this bias, that given the right circumstance that people move towards growth. 

01:04:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:04:25
LEAH BREW And if you don't believe that then working humanistic way wont work for you. 

01:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:04:30
LEAH BREW Because you're not trusting the clients inner self. 

01:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:04:35
LEAH BREW So, I don't do that with the client it's just I guess my assumption. 

01:04:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so how is this a skill in terms of… how you trust the client self- actualizing. 

01:04:50
LEAH BREW Hm… I dunno if it's a skill so much as it is a belief. 

01:04:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Tell me how would you convey and show the client? 

01:04:55
LEAH BREW Yeah I think um… because I believe it and I trust it then they do. 

01:05:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:05
LEAH BREW Right, if you do that with a child for example, if you constantly doing everything for your child and never let your child fail at anything then the child can't trust him or herself umm… so I know I feel like that's the position I take so the client given the right conditions they just do. 

01:05:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON No it's sounds like it is kinda of obsessional stance that leads to creating of these conditions in which the client also can learn to value and trust because you value and trust what the client's doing and yeah. Are they clients who might resist believing in their own abilities, or their own possibly the kinda of grow and change. 

01:05:45
LEAH BREW You know if I had conservation with them and said do you believe in your ability toward growth sure lots of client would say no. I don't have that conservation, right I just watch it happen. 

01:05:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:55
LEAH BREW And then it just happens in retrospect they discover it. 

01:06:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So just in a moment we are going to see you kinda off work with Caesar and continuation of that first session. What sort of viewers look for? 

01:06:10
LEAH BREW Am-Uh… little tiny insights. 

01:06:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:15
LEAH BREW Yeah, I think that was one of the things I loved about (inaudible ) that change happens in tiny bits. 

01:06:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:25
LEAH BREW Right it may take umm… so beginning counselors wanna go from A to Z in 10 minute. 

01:06:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay right. 

01:06:35
LEAH BREW Oh this is a problem this is how you fix it we're done you can go home now, but it doesn't work that way, but if you can give like little tiny sparks here and there of inside they built over time, and so that's what I would say to look for a little tiny new awareness. 

01:06:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so as the client begins to kinda of talk about his story we should look for those moments of kinda of insights, that you are kinda of (inaudible ) to highlight a note we'll see you where it takes us. 

01:07:05
LEAH BREW Okay. 

01:07:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:07:10
LEAH BREW You had mentioned that each time a relationship ends you feel like you have to start all over again, and feel this umm… I know discouragement what it sounds like. The pattern that happened in this relationship is that a pattern that has been repeated and other relationships. 

01:07:30
CESAR Yes it's a pattern for all my relationships I jump in so quick, and I get so excited and I end up feeling really hurt towards the end, and it kinda of like jumps on my face and like, it's the worst feeling. 

01:07:50
LEAH BREW Yeah, it sounds like you feel connected and attached very quickly. 

01:08:00
CESAR Yeah, a little scary even just talking about this 'cause umm…. just moving too fast and ending even faster, is the worsen, yeah it's happened throughout other relationships I remember being in a relationship with some one about four years ago and we are need together for a short period of time. May be two three weeks and we're like why don't we go to Hawaii, for a trip so we decided to go and we were in the relationship up to four months and we were at Hawaii, this beautiful place ah… paradise and I ended up breaking up with her day two of being there. I just remember thinking here am I moving in too fast again and it blowing up on my face, and this time I'm not even (inaudible ) some where else. And just having to be with that was hard. 

01:08:55
LEAH BREW Yeah the loss of, even just the hopes for that trip, if you felt that loss is what was the loss of the whole relationship. So, I know remembered you ended that relationship also. 

01:09:10
CESAR Yeah. I ended, the pattern for me is I once I start thinking I that I'm not kidding anything in the relationship where I'm not feeling happy anymore. I talk to my partner and I bring it up and if I noticed no changes then I end it really fast, I think about it though, it's not like I'm cold blooded and I just want to end a relationship really quick, I really want to talk right and work things out. And when I don't think it's gonna go anywhere I've ended every relationships I've been in. 

01:09:45
LEAH BREW So what happened in this relationship in Hawaii? That gave you an indication it was time to end it. 

01:09:55
CESAR Yeah, there's a big indication we went to Luau enjoying our time, and she started first off she had a child uh… and so there was constant communication with their baby's father and I totally thought it was in appropriate that they had this conservation with each other, and they need to talk day in and day out, but they needed to be some boundaries in a relationship and it was constant communication not about the son, but about their relationship together and when we were at Luau where in Hawaii, I just said this is stupid, why are you having this conservation your with me right now, but your texting him. And at that moment I felt alone in a relationship and I just remember being alone and I end up walking away later in the night, and just thinking about what should I do moving forward and I decided that she's still stuck in the relationship from the past relationship and that I should end it, and I did and she ended going back with him. 

01:11:00
LEAH BREW You were right! So what I'm hearing in these two examples of your relationships is how lonely you begin to feel, that you feel connected up to a point and then I don't know it seems like this more recent relationship, some thin clearly shifted and change I'm not sure that's true in the first one. 

01:11:20
CESAR Yeah, I didn't feel connected any more. And I literally felt like sounds silly like an umbilical cord like people are connected I know that sound really dumb, but I felt like we where just cut off from one and other, and we weren't sink anymore in the relationship, she was doing her own thing, I was in my own thing and I just said anything we're moving forward in the relationship anymore. 

01:11:50
LEAH BREW You're really sensitive to being on the same page and resonating with each other and connecting. 

01:11:55
CESAR Yeah. 

01:12:00
LEAH BREW And then when that changes, uh… sounds like you tried to address it, and if you're not satisfied then you end relationship. 

01:12:10
CESAR Yeah. 

01:12:10
LEAH BREW You're very clear about what you want. 

01:12:10
CESAR I am. 

01:12:10
LEAH BREW And what you're looking for. 

01:12:15
CESAR And that's a part that I'm struggling with because I get so excited, I'm like (inaudible ) in a relationship in he beginning, and I don't notice the things I should be aware of, yeah. 

01:12:25
LEAH BREW okay say more about that, you should be aware of so there's in retrospect. 

01:12:30
CESAR Right. 

01:12:30
LEAH BREW You see red flags that you didn't see initially? 

01:12:35
CESAR Yeah, I notice some but I get so caught up in this excitement in this flavor this ah… this new relationship. 

01:12:45
LEAH BREW Mm-hh… would it be accurate to say that you get so excited about the relationship you're ignoring red flags in fact you're so eager to be in a relationship. 

01:12:55
CESAR I am super eager to be in a relationship. 

01:13:00
LEAH BREW That you let go off, may be your rationalized through. So give me an example of a red flag that you have ignored in the past. 

01:13:10
CESAR Right where the person I was with in Hawaii she was a major stoner, she smoke weed through out the day, three four times a day, and I didn't anted to be with some one like that to begin with. Yeah she kept cold turkey, uh… but that was a big red flag. Uh… arguing with her baby daddy, that was a way to much to deal with in. I know we all have a baggage, I have my own baggage for me it's what ever you decide to do with it, doesn't make it a baggage. I'd think that she was taking care of it in a healthy way. 

01:13:45
LEAH BREW So I believe that there is a reason behind what we do, and there's a reason behind your eagerness to built your own family and feel that connection, and so I'm wondering have you thought about where that may come from? 

01:14:05
CESAR Yeah. I didn't have a close relationship with my father while growing up. He and my mom separated when I was three years old and he moved and they finalized a divorced when I was I think eight or nine years old, ended up moving to Mexico, and he lived there for 13, 14 years and they really have a relationship with him I probably saw once a year, once every two, three years if that we didn't talk on regular bases, so yeah that was hard. 

01:14:45
LEAH BREW So you're aware feeling if this isn't inaccurate statement a whole in your heart with that being that's kinda how I'm feeling like there is a piece missing and your yearning for filling that space. 

01:14:55
CESAR Yeah, that why I jump in so quick as I, I'm feeling that emptiness inside and I just wanted to be reassured the person's not gonna leave me kinda like my father did, when he went to Mexico. 

01:15:10
LEAH BREW Yeah, you're scared of being abandoned. Yeah. That's not good inside to have. 

01:15:20
CESAR Yeah. 

01:15:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Wow! That was really interesting in terms of kinds seeing Cesar kinda talk about his past experiences and kinda what happened to him and how he's kinda grown from them. 

01:15:35
LEAH BREW Yeah, he seems to um… be aware of his how hungry he is for love? 

01:15:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah that just seem to like he, he felt he conveyed to you that he kinda knows what he wants or and to make know what he doesn't want. 

01:15:55
LEAH BREW Yeah and what's interesting I've got to assume that his relationship with his mother must be good, because he knows what distance is? Right, because some people who don't have that experience don't know and so they keep fighting and staying, but so there's something really positive and growth oriented in him, that already knows what good relationship should feel like. 

01:16:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay so sound like you're already kinda of trusting that this client has, his self actualization tendencies. 

01:16:25
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So you see it and that's to orient that… 

01:16:30
LEAH BREW I see it, yeah when he could articulate precisely what was missing for him, like what moment where that happened and that he had that maturity to confront his previous relationship, his partners about what wasn't working. And that hey Okay! they still couldn't change so they where on a different path then he was. 

01:16:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I'll take and watching that how, how some one might unheard that story and say okay! this guy went to Hawaii and he's to day in and he breaks up with his girl friend he's at Luau like it's got to be more to that story, like what's really happening and in a state you kinda said Wow! You really knew something was not right? You know this wasn't right for and there was something going on? You trusted I could see that you kinda of really encouraged him, that you trusted his instincts. 

01:17:20
LEAH BREW Yeah I do, that's what… like I said I think, he must have a really close relationship with his mom, because he seems to know what connection feels like. 

01:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:17:30
LEAH BREW And I could feel his connection in the session, right he was doing our relationship well. And so he also knows what non-relationship feels like, because that's what he had with his dad. And as soon as it starts to feel like dad he says Nope! This isn't what I want, I wanna recreate mom not dad. 

01:17:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know Leah you mentioned that, that there is this peril obvious happening that I was just talking about, what he wants in a relationship you're aware that, you know it's just the beginning of your relationship you already get the scent that he can built these relationships? 

01:18:05
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:18:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so that's evidence that your reading that he does have these growth potential, there's possibility. 

01:18:10
LEAH BREW Yeah, and it also it's well I think every body has it, any way, and it's just my assumption but it helps me measure where he is at with that okay. Right because some people don't know how to do that they've never been in a healthy relationship. I have a few students who have experienced trauma, yeah and they don't know what that feels like. 

01:18:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:18:30
LEAH BREW So they keep getting in messy, messy relationships and repeat over and over, but he is trying to re establish something that he knows is good and feeling it from him, I can say that okay he knows what it is? So he's just kinda of figure out how to do that well. 

01:18:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah I got that sense that's some times that sounds if you worry about going to soon to fast or sort of reading other clients but it seemed to me like you're getting these signs that, that you know he's ready to go her and knows that you're again your tone your body language how you're realign again, what your saying, how you're saying was really kinda of one of like you know I'm going here with you right now. 

01:19:10
LEAH BREW Mm-huh I don't believe that going to fast have… going to fast is I gently nudge the client and the client walks, I gently nudge and they walk and then I gently nudge and then thy stop I'm like okay we'll spend some time here. 

01:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:19:25
LEAH BREW We're not that's going to fast. 

01:19:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:19:25
LEAH BREW But I never think I can go too deep too fast, if they go with me. 

01:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:19:30
LEAH BREW if they don't go with me, then I know, but then it's too fast. So I trust that internally sort of self regulation that they have, that like this is oh! This is safe, this is safe, oh this isn't safe anymore. 

01:19:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right so you're really constantly reading and assessing. 

01:19:45
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:19:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Kindda what's in front of you? good, why don't we go to our next enactment which is called you're not alone. 

01:19:55
LEAH BREW Okay. 

01:20:00
Assessment Strategies 

01:20:00
You Are Not Alone 

01:20:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Leah what is it you are not alone mean. 

01:20:10
LEAH BREW So, there is an existential belief, that we are all ultimately alone. 

01:20:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:20:20
LEAH BREW And I think in some ways that's true. But in other ways it's really not. Alones is more spiritual, emotional, experience. And I feel like that one thing that therapy can do that umm… lot of people don't have in their other relationship. Helping them I dunno face something's scary in the presence or I guess in the containment of others while being held through it. 

01:20:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. So that while he face or walk through this when they are walking through by them selves in many ways. 

01:21:00
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

01:21:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, So what's the assess of conveying that to a client. 

01:21:05
LEAH BREW Well I think that goes back to the empathy, that I was demonstrating it before, I think part of that is I get you, I see you, I hear you, I'm with you. And I'm not afraid of anything that you're telling me. 

01:21:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how does that go back to building the alliance though. 

01:21:25
LEAH BREW Um…. you're not alone in the alliance, if I'm not present, if I'm giving inaccurate empathy or empathic failures then they can't feel safe enough to explore what's unacceptable to them. So, by being present with them, they I think that strengthens the relationship which deepens the level of work that we could do. 

01:22:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that's nice you'd thinking about it, I was thinking that you know if you have empathic failure you miss the client, and the feeling is that I'm alone right, you don't get me. 

01:22:10
LEAH BREW You don't get me. Nobody gets me. 

01:22:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right and that's gonna lead to you know that's completely refraction therapy took alliance that's not gonna happen. 

01:22:20
LEAH BREW Yeah, and it's okay if it happens once in a while. 

01:22:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:22:20
LEAH BREW Because some times those fractures can strengthen the relationship to show the client like that it can, you can make a mistake and you can over come it. But yeah you can't have too many. 

01:22:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON We do ever self as close you think to the client that feels like a connection between the two of you. 

01:22:35
LEAH BREW If appropriate. 

01:22:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:22:40
LEAH BREW Right so, A we depend on the client. 

01:22:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:22:45
LEAH BREW Because not, not all clients have good boundaries. So some clients work really hard to pull away from themselves so I wouldn't do what some body like that, but some body who can be with themselves, with me then I might do it and then, be it would be only to make sure that they. It is about them. 

01:23:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:23:10
LEAH BREW Not about me like I would do if my friends. 

01:23:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:23:10
LEAH BREW But to help them understand, hey I kinda know what you've been through. I dunno what exactly what you've been through, but I've been through some thin similar, and have my own experience of it. 

01:23:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So sounds like you would but… 

01:23:20
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:23:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But with these kinds o rules in place with the right kinda of purpose in place. 

01:23:25
LEAH BREW Right and I would say later, right not in the first session. 

01:23:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna see you, work with Carla, more in that first session, what should we focus on as viewers and look for it. 

01:23:40
LEAH BREW Am… I'd say continue to look at the empathy. 

01:23:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:23:40
LEAH BREW And my body language being open and receptive, my tone of voice matching her. Mm… my non judgmental position, and is there anything else if you are not alone. You were not alone like I said kinda has two layers to it. So one is you not alone I'm with you, and then there is this you're not alone that you're not the only person in the world with this experience, so look to see if that comes up. 

01:24:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:24:15
LEAH BREW SO. we've talked about a lot of areas where you sense enormous amount of responsibility, you did really give me some examples about your family responsibilities, I'm kinda of curious about that. 

01:24:30
CLARA Okay so, one of my major responsibility I guess is helping home with my sister, my elder sister who has or suffers from severe depression. So, like I mentioned my parents are elderly, and they don't drive. So, a lot of the times my time, my free time consists of taking her to her appointments to see her psychologist or helping my parents with her. So lot of my responsibility is to help them take care of her. 

01:25:10
LEAH BREW And then they don't drive so, all transportation is in your hands. You're the limo driver of the family. 

01:25:20
CLARA Yeah, 

01:25:25
LEAH BREW Ah… and then you have the additional burden of taking care of your sisters, transportation needs as well, does it just end with transportation. 

01:25:40
CLARA No, I mean I try to be there for her, like emotionally too, you know I spend a lot of time with her, so she doesn't feel alone, I spend a lot of time with my parents and just talking to them about you know understanding her situation a little bit better and how to help her best. And to her really also to learn how to help herself, 'cause I do feel like she's kinda of like the center of attention at home, you know I'm expected to have everything under control, and to still help her, help them which… I don't mind, I want my sister to be well, but at the same time it's like whose taking care of me, you know. 

01:26:25
LEAH BREW Yeah who takes care of Clara? It's a good question. I find it ironic that you wanna help your sister, learn how to take care of herself and help your parents understand what goes on with her and your not walking the talk right, you are not taking care of yourself as well as you could. 

01:26:55
CLARA Yeah, that's a lot of work uh… I know I need to do her on that. 

01:27:00
LEAH BREW Yeah. But the pressure of families seem I think is stronger than the need for self care. 

01:27:15
CLARA Yeah, I turning away, to do something that I have to do for myself, when I know that thy need me isn't really an option. My family is my everything. 

01:27:30
LEAH BREW Yeah, yeah. Your really touched when you say that, how important your family is to you, and I find that very common Hispanic Latino families. Um… the balance of that connection and caring and taking care of each other, and yet how culturated in the Unites states and aware of self caring away may be if your raised else where you wouldn't have been aware of. Right and also sometimes just feeling tired from that pressure. 

01:28:25
CLARA Yeah. 

01:28:25
LEAH BREW I can feel that right the weight of that, and the fullness of that to fullness of you're the importance of your family and your connection. 

01:28:40
CLARA Yeah it's definitely hard to balance wanting to take care of my self and do wells and keep it all together and at the same time giving them all my time and doing as much as I can make sure that they're okay. 

01:29:00
[sil.] 

01:29:05
LEAH BREW You must have learnt at a very young age that you must be competent, you must be responsible. 

01:29:15
CLARA Yeah, I've felt like an adult all my life. 

01:29:20
[sil.] 

01:29:25
LEAH BREW Once the earliest you remember feeling that way. 

01:29:30
CLARA Think when I was may be about 12, yeah. 

01:29:35
LEAH BREW What happened? 

01:29:40
CLARA My older sister, would always you know, Oh we need to do this, and put in me to do it, So I basically I came t live in the US when I was 12, and we started middle school together, so we where dropped off, at this new school, in a different country, did not speak the language and my sister was like oh! Go to the office and ask them where we need to go, and I thought like she's older you know she is suppose to be taking care of me, but I think that's when I became very real to me that I needed to grow up, and I needed to perform, you know a lot more than just what I expected from myself I guess, So, I did I went to the office I don't even remember what I said 'cause I didn't speak English, I just remember that I worked out but there's always been that pattern of like you know, even my older sister relied on me when I was younger. 

01:30:45
LEAH BREW It's a lot of pressure for a 12 year old girl, relying on you, so much. So you can um… I dunno it's this interesting duality of feeling that connection and being needed, right there's something very reinforcing about that, because you needed a little less. I wonder if you would still feel so good about yourself. 

01:31:25
CLARA Yeah, that's an interesting question? 

01:31:30
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

01:31:35
[sil.] 

01:31:40
LEAH BREW I've worked with other individuals who are immigrants from lots of different places and I find that the childhood experience you describe is not uncommon, that feeling of um, being able to learn a language more quickly then the parents do for example right 'cause when your young your brain is more flexible and the needing to take on more and more responsibility as they grow older as you were growing older. 

01:32:20
CLARA Yeah. 

01:32:20
LEAH BREW Yeah have you talked with other people, other individuals who've had your kind of experience. 

01:32:30
CLARA I mean I have some friends who, you know are also immigrants and I guess it's normal you know they don't really talk about it, I just know that you know may be I'm not the only person who is going through that, it's just like you said you know, it's like an expectation if your parents don't speak the language then you have to you know do what you can do to help them. 

01:33:00
LEAH BREW Yeah, it just is, So in a way it's your first time to kinda of look at it, as something that may be you can decide as I suppose you just do? 

01:33:15
CLARA Yeah. 

01:33:20
LEAH BREW Yeah, I'm glad you've been able to talk with other people to find out that its not just you. 

01:33:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So Leah is that a good example of kinda of conveying that, that client's not alone. 

01:33:35
LEAH BREW Yeah, I think that turned out to be better than I expected, yeah. 

01:33:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, So it sound like you said earlier that it's a continuation of empathy so it's kind of deepening the empathy with her, but it seems to be a little bit more because there's more to that, like you're conveying that you're really, really with her. 

01:33:55
LEAH BREW Yes, I wanted her to really feel my presence. 

01:33:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah and at some point you shared that Clara's experience has never grand as an adolescence immigrant isn't if something may be you interview her before, by the people in her shoes. 

01:34:10
LEAH BREW Yes. I wanted her to I dunno to think about how she isn't actually alone in that particular experience 

01:34:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:34:20
LEAH BREW Because that is in the literature very common experience for one and a half generation immigrants. 

01:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like theirs is universality to her story. 

01:34:25
LEAH BREW Yes and my guess was that she had talk to somebody about that, but may be hadn't made that connection. 

01:34:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Or may be just remembered it, 

01:34:35
LEAH BREW Yeah, yeah. 

01:34:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know that's if some body forms a self less closure, is well it sounds like your self is closed to bit of that to build a bridge. My hunch is that again you're feeling that inside that you've heard this before. 

01:34:50
LEAH BREW Yes, yeah it's um, a too common story, it's a very common story, and I wanted her to understand that I dunno I guess they say name it to tame it, right so by identifying that this is what happens when you immigrate as a child no judgment not good not bad, it just is. 

01:35:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON This is. 

01:35:15
LEAH BREW And a that she can feel less alone in that experience. 

01:35:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah and then I did seem like you sent this message that, that Carla is not alone in two ways like there was this, this linking other people's experiences and it definitely was this aspect about how this alignment between you and her and she's not alone in the room with you. 

01:35:40
LEAH BREW Yeah, I wanted her to feel my presence to feel safe with me. To feel my unconditional positive regard, and I think even in the conservation about not being alone is this being part of immigration experience, I didn't label it good or bad. 

01:36:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:36:00
LEAH BREW Right, and I think by not doing that, it says that it isn't innately good or bad, it just is and it's her experience and um, and it also leads it also gave her the opportunity to find a way to make meaning in her family to send her belonging of taking care of every body. 

01:36:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah you know as I watch that Leah maundering and as the viewers are watching that and they might be think oh Leah's just performing, she is acting as a therapist right here, but I'm wondering did you really feel that, did you really feel connected to her that moment that she is not alone. 

01:36:40
LEAH BREW I did. 

01:36:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:36:40
LEAH BREW I absolutely, did um…. I'm not acting when I'm doing the empathy part. I'll tell you the part that was constructed you'll notice there was a pause before I went to that immigrant experience piece and I was thinking about okay this segment is about you were not alone. Isn't enough my presence is that then I thought No! I really wanted to understand to name the immigrant experience. 

01:37:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

01:37:10
LEAH BREW And so that's I was in that moment deciding and I guess that's authentic that deciding session I do that all the time. 

01:37:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. We make choices. 

01:37:20
LEAH BREW Right, but what's not authentic is I'm not always thinking you are not alone. 

01:37:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. 

01:37:25
LEAH BREW So that was constructive like in order to demonstrate that more. 

01:37:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:37:30
LEAH BREW But the non judgmental part how that was done was definitely authentic. 

01:37:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah I mean as I was watching that I was like wow! She's really holding her you really actually at the sense like you're almost you were holding hands. 

01:37:45
LEAH BREW Yeah I feel like I'm hugging her yeah. 

01:37:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Why don't I move to our last kinda of skill, which is goal alignment between client and counselor 

01:37:55
Assessment Strategies 

01:37:55
Goal Alignment Between 

01:37:55
Client And Counselor 

01:38:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Leah why is goal setting so important in building the treatment of client. 

01:38:05
LEAH BREW Um…. it's not the building of the aliment it's the maintaining of the alliance in my opinion, and it has to start in the beginning, because you wanna make sure you're on the same page, right because if the therapist is going in one direction, and the client is going another. The therapist feels frustrated that the client's no making progress, the way the therapist thinks he or she should, and the client feels frustrated that he or she is not getting their goals met. 

01:38:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so sounds what you I mean goal aliment is that you kinda come together, towards may be end of the session, or towards the beginning in which you make sure that, that you are on the same page. 

01:38:45
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:38:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It's sound like it's important to set goals, but also important to kinda talk about what the method of reaching those goals. 

01:38:55
LEAH BREW Yeah I um… I think that's why I do so much empathy in early sessions especially in the first session. Not just to establish the relationship but to help me understand what the problem is? And I also realize the goal may change in time, as we nuance and explore more, but it tells us where we need to go. 

01:39:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Are you transparent? And how you kinda of talk with your client's but kinda what we are going to in session how we are gonna reach those goals? 

01:39:25
LEAH BREW Absolutely, I think it's really critical, that we're on the same page there. 

01:39:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so what happens if you're not on the same page? 

01:39:35
LEAH BREW Then I need to readjust my self. 

01:39:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:39:35
LEAH BREW Most of the time. I'll say that 'cause now I'm thinking oh what about that client who thinks I should just have some magical words of wisdom. 

01:39:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:39:45
LEAH BREW And I some times have to acculturate them to what therapy is? 

01:39:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay so it sounds like there is where you can and can't do. 

01:39:50
LEAH BREW Yes. 

01:39:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But for the most part you looking what the client gonna need and goals are, and do you basting kind of negotiate that with him or her. 

01:40:00
LEAH BREW Yeah. 

01:40:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, So in just a moment we are gonna watch you work with Cesar and this is the end of his, his kinda of first session, what should we look for? 

01:40:10
LEAH BREW Um… again I'll be using empathy to make sure that I'm on the right page with him. 

01:40:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:40:15
LEAH BREW And through that empathy, kinda talk through the process of what we've gone through. I like to do that with clients, and then set goals based on sort of where we came from and where we wanna go next. 

01:40:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So sounds like in your head you're kinda of thinking about us, you know you're taking kinda stock of the session of what he's saying and your gonna convey that to him, kinda as we end here this kinda of thing we could work on together. 

01:40:40
LEAH BREW Yeah summarizing. 

01:40:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Summarizing okay good. 

01:40:45
LEAH BREW So we only have a few minutes left and I think I'm getting a pretty good picture of what's going on for you. And I'd like to have some sort of goals and direction that we're moving in. And so what I'm hearing is that may be wanting to… pay attention to the red flags in a relationships. Ah… may be to reduce your eagerness to get into that relationship, the next one and may be ultimately to fill that hole as much as you can. How does that sound to you? 

01:41:35
CESAR Yeah I like these goals, I definitely wanna I feel I'm empty inside, what to be okay. Actually being single which I haven't been in a very long time. 

01:41:45
LEAH BREW When's the last time you were single. 

01:41:50
CESAR One thing that doesn't work out, then I jump into another relationship, I dunno may be two weeks after, it's like I'm scared to be alone I just a… I need to take a pill to take away my numbness, and a…. 

01:42:15
LEAH BREW Your numbness. I'm not sure if you pill is getting in a relationship. Is that your pill? 

01:42:25
CESAR My pill is like take away the pain of feeling alone. 

01:42:30
LEAH BREW to take away the pain. Okay. All right so may be helping to sit with your feeling of aloneness and may be to reduce them without using other people. 

01:42:40
CESAR Right. 

01:42:45
LEAH BREW All right so I think we could start working on that if that works for you. 

01:42:50
CESAR I wish perfectly. 

01:42:50
LEAH BREW Okay great thanks. 

01:42:50
CESAR Thank you! 

01:42:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Leah is this how you might end an opening session. 

01:42:55
LEAH BREW Absolutely yes. 

01:42:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:00
LEAH BREW I think it's important that the client goes away with some hope. 

01:43:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:43:05
LEAH BREW About doing what they is they done. 

01:43:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay so it's not just enough to kinda of feel like I'm not alone, this person hears me, they got me, it's also they should leave like a vision… like they got me and this is where we going to go.. 

01:43:20
LEAH BREW Yes exactly hope that we can make a change. 

01:43:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, so how did you help this client gain clarity about his concerns? 

01:43:30
LEAH BREW So I summarized a little bit about where he started with, the recent end of his relationship how that has been a repetition and he gave me an example of that where some… like where that whole came from which may be his relationship with his father, so trying to pull all those pieces together, and I'm not just summarizing for the client, I'm doing it to develop my own treatment plan. 

01:43:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure yeah. 

01:43:55
LEAH BREW So what is the problem here, So, so far the problem is he has a hole and he is trying to hurry up and fill it. So that I didn't know that until we stated it until I reflected it back to him. 

01:44:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And that's what was really important to get in some agreement with him on this and to that you both were on the same page with the goals. 

01:44:20
LEAH BREW I try to take a moment to reflect a piece, check to see that I'm getting yep, yep that's right. And do that along the way. 

01:44:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:44:30
LEAH BREW Which might be different with the client who has poor boundaries, not poor boundaries may be is to agreeable. 

01:44:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:44:35
LEAH BREW So I might not be as assertive I might ask them to do it, because it's hard to know if your right. 

01:44:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:44:45
LEAH BREW Clients who agree all the time. But he seem to have good boundaries with that be able to assert himself to say no if he needed to. 

01:44:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So if we where to kind of watch a second, third, fourth session with you and this client. What do you think you'll might go from here. 

01:45:00
LEAH BREW I would wanna work on that hole. And fully experiencing it, exploring it, may be hearing the history, and working through that pain. 

01:45:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, you know Leah you have shown us a lot today in terms of how you approach these really moments with these clients, I think in terms of kinda of your approach verses in seeing how you are so tuned and present and warm and open, and then you really built these connection. I think it's really nice models for viewers to see it's kinda of this is what it can look like. 

01:45:35
