I go really in depth with things, and it just kicks me like I almost feel like this rushing feeling because it's… I don’t know how to explain it. 

00:00:45
[sil.] 

00:01:05
There are some many stereotypes about it, you know in words like alcoholic and addict you know who just have these ideas from the media and movies or seeing how much people or you know, when you get into recovery, everybody's story is so rich, in what they’ve been through and its so understandable, why everybody goes down the road, that they go down, and the path that you have to take to get better, it's all pretty much the same.

00:02:00
In recovery from alcohol abuse, I met these women. 

00:02:05
[sil.] 

00:02:15
ALLISON I think it is all within me, I do not believe in my case, because I don't think, I had like an abusive upbringing. I think, I was just so, so sensitive, and emotionally fragile, that it were. 

00:02:40
BONNIE I started using when I was like 12, 13 um... smoke pipe(ph) my mom was a huge neighbor in my whole amusing time now and actually my dad was chivies like the kind of ignore on what was going on, did you know it was an (inaudible ) whenever your friends or parents smoke dope too sometimes in their 70s. 

00:03:10
SOPHIA The way I grew up affected me. I never wanted to admit that, you know, I never wanted to admit that I was, you know, that certain thing I did, and certain ways I acted I was getting back at my parents for just being the way that they were. 

00:03:30
BABRIELLA I never had anybody there for me, nobody was you know (inaudible ) I didn't go to pre-school, I didn't go to kindergarten you know, I was (inaudible ) that goes in but I didn't go to middle school, junior high or I didn't go to any other schools, you know whether raised anyone particular. 

00:03:50
HELEN There was a lot alcoholism in my adapted family. I grew up knowing that my dad was an alcoholic, I went to meetings with him. He would say I’m an alcoholic and this is my daughter and she is not an alcoholic, everyone would laugh. My Dad is a neurologist. He specializes in people with addictions. 

00:04:25

00:04:30
ASHLEY We are living together in Budapest, Hungary when I was studying over there and I think he was manic, depressive, and he killed himself when I was leaving him. After I returned from Budapest, I just immersed myself completely in painting, I have no one to kinda commune my family experience, so I did that with my painting, my drinking escalated, sort of just kind of being around and at peace of myself okay I originally had done with my art work. 

00:05:10
BONNIE There was many (inaudible ) bottles and my mom let us pour out the juice and she filled it with (inaudible ) wine and we drink it at lunch and we skipped bus, then one day a teacher found out. We got into trouble and they just called my mom and said please stop sending your daughter to school with wine anymore. 

00:05:40
You know you’re dressing the cool stuff, you’re in the cool place, you know and we’ve got the bus going just the right level and we just got all going on, and then the flipside of that is you’re doing, you know you’re having the same drinks in your apartment looking (inaudible ). 

00:06:00
My brother was… you know we used to stay together, and you know that's how we’re bonded, now there was no second thinking, there could be a problem or you know I’m just hanging on, I’m a normal person doing the same thing, that everybody else does. 

00:06:25
[sil.] 

00:06:30
I can think of you know several pivotal things in my life, if that thing hadn't happened and nothing hadn't happened at that time, I would have been able to recover from that situation. After it happened, it was too late, I was hardly checked out and I was, you know sucked into something, that I couldn't get myself out of. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:00
ALLISON And it is pretty depressing when your you know cooking up for your (inaudible ) smoking yourself, and then run out of beer, you’re the only one there that can go and get beer, and its 3:00 in the morning, you got to wait for 6:00 in the morning, and then liquor store opens and then you don't have cars, you got to walk down the liquor store, that's like really funky on Miller Broadway, and you are out there 6:00 in morning with other bums on the street with a handful of change, because you’ve no money, that you dug out of, like the bottom of every person that you have or pocket, you know, and the guy knew me at the liquor store, I’d just put handful of change and you know if it was roughly like a dollar fifty, I’d get two (inaudible [00:07:39), that was my little habitual(ph). 

00:07:45
BABRIELLA Last time, when I wanted to do is to say I can wean for the rest of my life, and you get at six, and you know to work at 9, get off at five and make dinner at eight and dope can be a lot like that, you know playing house with myself (inaudible ). 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:10
SONG Look on the world are you… Ha…ha…ha…a… oh Ha…ha…ha…a. 

00:08:35
If you took away the visual of every person, you would be a such a similar story, everybody going out, feeling of pulled toward the dark side and another people, you know may be are afraid to go into those rooms. 

00:08:55
BABRIELLA With that really I’m not bothered there would be no... don't have any highs and lows. 

00:09:05
BONNIE I have a cousin, who was little bit older than me, and she was the like a (inaudible ) She had like that (inaudible ) you know high hair, and white lipstick, and she smoke and I just thought she was the coolest being you know, I totally want to emulate her, I was like drawn to the darker side from my early age, I don't know what I was. I couldn't get to a point to where, I didn't care anyone. I would be so just gone, whatever I could get my hands on I was you know, trying to get high. 

00:09:45
HELEN (inaudible ) said it like may cause drowsiness or don't operate machinery under this spell or don't take with alcohol you know, I was taking it. 

00:10:00
BONNIE I would have this drug dealer, he was totally insane. I would hear let's shoot up in your neck and I mean he was just crazy and he was shooting up all the way long. 

00:10:20
SOPHIA I couldn't stop thinking like if I keep doing this I’, gonna die this way, you know and like and just things just fell apart from me really fast, every time I got loaded. 

00:10:35
BABRIELLA As far as I am… if am sick, I go nowhere and afternoon jobs, I used to model, get nearly plain dope sick. My least favorite word is abstaining(ph) I hate that word, its French I don’t want people saying oh you’re in junkie, and got problem, you know, but I mean (inaudible ) cover that up pretty well. I am going to use that really you know the strength(ph) of it you know. 

00:11:05
ALLISON It’s like the dark force and the light force and I kept making a choice to go to the dark, and then I started feeling like, that the dark was going to take over and kept choosing the dark. Okay go and get dark. That I thought if I lose the… and that it was like a little sliver left, and if I lost that, if the sliver went out it was like a little flame flickering if that flame went out I would... I would have lost my chance either I would have killed myself, killed someone else, gone to jail for life, you know or you know just been some been some mumbling street person and I mean, that what I felt like it was going to be, if I lost my whole essence of my, of what my real soul was. 

00:11:50
[sil] 

00:13:15
HELEN We are having our house redone and there was this lady there was painting the tram(ph) in the house. We talked a lot everyday when she would come in, of course, I was there doing nothing, you know, just getting wasted every night and then it turned out that, you know this woman her name just so happened to be Faith and it was, it was in you know coincidence. We became good friends and she said to me, you know and telling may be you do have a problem and may be you don't have a problem and maybe there is something about it now, maybe you do something about it later may be, you never did something about it, but I am just, I just wanted to tell you that, if you do think that there was a slight chance that you have a problem it gets worse. 

00:14:10
I have friends from (inaudible ) age that I knew throughout you know 20 years or something and about three of my friends came over and they said, you need to go to the hospital and I just, was just (inaudible ) out there just led me by the arm you know, (inaudible ) being rescued which was just been moving. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:55
When I got into recovery, I met I don't know remember who it is? 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:05
I live with them in the recovery home, I met them over working in a residential treatment facility. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:20
Connecting through our, we saw come in common ground. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:50
We might paint personally, that I put put paint in these pictures too. And also we know some of my drug use, which just like I want to show that it exists and that other people see that, I wasn't quite normal. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:20
ALLISON I used art as my… as my means of controlling my mind. You know, I would draw these pictures and you know, just it made me feel better. 

00:16:35
[sil.] 

00:16:40
I feel that if I didn’t do that probably, might amused, that might have you know, gone off a deep kinda(ph) of depression in us, but it really helped me, and me, it helped me feel powerful and in control just like to do when I was a kid, you know, like I can handle this, because I can create my own reality. 

00:17:05
[sil.] 

00:17:10
When I do my art, I don’t know I guess there are certain things, but it just like all that crap that's just like in the back of my head, that's, that's the outlet for it. I guess it's a way to release all the whatever it is that I build up and... and... and... it's a way to express it, without really having to explain it. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:18:00
For me art going (inaudible ) a lot of things, I've stuck in a car, often a lot so, you know, I had draw pictures, and that has been so fast, that I don't keep my art work, things that people don't recognize, refused to recognize or offended by, is what I want to draw. Drug, motion(ph), alcoholism. 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:18:40
HELEN The whole fact that art is helping me cope with pain and alcoholism and it's an outlet and stuff like that, am… when I'm taking pictures of nature it does help me, you know, kinda just like, step out of myself and just be there at that moment. It's very um... (inaudible ) tiny little things of life, you know, that that people don't see, like the raindrops on a leaf. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
ASHLEY I think, in the recovery process whatever avenue you choose you have to have something in your life, that's really important to you and hold some meaning to improve you, and keep you occupied and so, I would say for me, it gives me a goal to keep going. something to focus my difficult stuff on is in my art work, it's a place to really top that energy into, go on my paintings are very sad, and that was during the time of lot of grief, so I think, I have done similar thing only in recovery, it has been a lot more, being ill it use(ph) in your own life, so it just a way that you use that. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:35
Out there who you, I have to go crazy, as that, the best thing that you who can't think to do. And now I'm lost without a place to go crazy, I'm not as a sun rise on the other side to pull me through. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
I don't think anyone ever really fully recovered. So its life, constant process of self-discovery. We surrender our whole lives, way to know our self from healings and emotions and then you decide to get sober and it's like up get rate if be(ph) live it more. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
There is so many lessons still that I had to learn, you know so many, like things that I had to admit to myself, before I could change it. I would do art sometimes and it would just get me through that, get me through that, then I consider that saving my life, you know. 

00:22:50
It's when something internally switches, it's one of the hardest things, you ever have to do. 

00:23:00
We came here on this planet. And living it for a while, so you got to be okay with it.

Young women are more vulnerable to abuse and addiction: they get hooked faster and suffer the consequences sooner than boys and young men. (National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse) ...drug treatment is still relatively inaccessible for women. Persistent negative attitudes towards drug abusers have prevented progress in drug treatment. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) only 15% of residential programs and 3% of outpatient programs in the U.S. are for women (Gender Differences in Treatment Needs, Services, Utilization, and Outcomes, Karol A. Kaltenbach, Ph.D.) Annual deaths due to illness related to drug abuse: four times that of those who die of breast cancer. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services)
