  Hey, Jack! Jack! Jack, come here, I gotta talk to you. Hey, ah, I think you ought to know something, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:00:35
JACK What's going on? 

00:00:35
 There's a guy upstairs, he's lighting fires in the cell after lockup. That guy's gotta be nuts! 

00:00:40
JACK What? Lighting cells? 

00:00:40
 Lighting fires in his cell. You know what I mean. Playing with matches and lights newspapers and he flushes 'em down the toilet. I think the guy thinks he's a fireman. 

00:00:45
JACK  Well, I've been working all, I've been working all, every night this week and no else has complained about it. Well, how come you can see everything? 

00:00:55
 Well, I can see it right in the reflection of that glass right there, John. I'm telling you, I'm not, I'm scared! I don't like the idea of being locked up in this place after lockup and, ah, this guy playing with matches. I'm telling you, (crosstalk) 

00:01:00
JACK  Well, what is he. (crosstalk) 

00:01:05
 ...I think I'd look into it. 

00:01:05
JACK Well, what is he burning? Do you know? (crosstalk) 

00:01:05
 Newspapers, newspapers. Yeah! 

00:01:05
JACK  Has he, (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
 I see the reflection. 

00:01:10
JACK ...has he thrown fires from upstairs down here? (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
 No. He's not throwin' them down. He just lights 'em in his cell and he puts 'em out on the toilet, he flushes the toilet and he laughs. I think the guy's crazy. You gotta look into this guy. I'll tell you. 

00:01:15
JACK Well, I haven't seen any smoke or anything around here but uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
 Well, you should be hang around after lockup, you'll see. Believe me when I tell you, he'll do it. Really, you gotta look into it. The guy's nuts! I'm tellin' you right now. 

00:01:25
JACK Alright. Well, listen, hey! Don't be spreadin' any rumors around here that you don't know nothing, anything for sure about, alright? I'll check it out and I'll get back to you. (crosstalk) 

00:01:30
 Hey, I'm just tellin' you. 

00:01:35
CONNORS  Oh Lewis, I got a note here for you. It says your public defender won't be here today. 

00:01:40
LEWIS Hey Connors! What do you mean? I gotta go to court in the morning without seeing this guy? 

00:01:45
CONNORS Hey, I don't know anything about it. 

00:01:45
LEWIS  For the last five days I've been tryin' to get his phone number, what he looks like, anything. Nobody will tell me nothing. (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
CONNORS Hey, I can see your concern. What do you want me to do? 

00:01:55
LEWIS Isn't there anything you can do? 

00:01:55
CONNORS Well, what can I do? I don't know anything about this guy. 

00:02:00
LEWIS Anything about 'em. Any, anybody else in this place got him for a lawyer? 

00:02:00
CONNORS Jesus! That's not my problem. I don't know anything about this guy. 

00:02:05
LEWIS Nothin'! You can't, you can't tell me ah, a phone number or nothing? (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

00:02:11

00:03:10
STERN Bertha, you knew that when you came in here you were under that pressure. I don't understand why you are not handling it properly. That was part of the bargain, that you be responsible.

00:03:25
BERTHA Listen! You, it's done all the time. You can go right down to Classification and ask them. All you have to do is tell them that I'm having problems. 

00:03:30
STERN I've moved you more times I moved anybody else and the Classification's getting have fed up with you and so am I, Bertha. 

00:03:35

00:06:05
RALPH PACKARD Do these instances seem familiar to you? If you're a Correctional Officer, you've been in plenty of similar situations. If you've worked in a correctional facility, you know the problem well. All day long, in the regular performance of your duties, you have to deal with conflicts with inmates. The tensions and the stress mounts. There's frustration on all sides and sometimes things erupt into violence. The job of a correctional officer isn't easy. The closed and confined nature of correctional facilities puts everyone under pressure. When inmates feel frustrated and powerless, they vent their anger on correctional officers or they try to manipulate an individual correctional officer in order to get what they want. Sometimes, they are simply emotionally upset and have nowhere else to turn but to the line officer on the block. 

00:07:00
RALPH PACKARD Hello, I'm Ralph Packard. From my 20 years experience in corrections, I'm familiar with the kinds of scenes you've just witnessed. The challenge of being a correctional officer is figuring out how to handle these problems. If they're handled well, the problem subside. If they're handled badly or ignored, then tension and stress can erupt into violence. But how can a correctional officer learn to handle problem after problem all day long and still keep a positive attitude towards his work? Most of the correctional officers accept this level of tension and stress on the job or is there a way to reduce it? Are there ways of handling conflicts with inmates that would reduce the number of disciplinary actions? Is there possibly a way to create a more livable correctional environment for staff and inmates alike? These are very important questions for corrections. The program you are about to begin is designed to address them. This is a difficult situation and certainly no one has all the answers, but this program tries to face it in a very pragmatic way. It teaches you a set of eight basic skills to help you minimize your conflict with inmates. The program is called, "Conflict Prevention Skill Training." Its overall objective is to teach correctional officers like yourself a set of communication and management tools that will help you handle inmates. The training program has eight sessions in all. Each session will concentrate on one skill. All the skills are interrelated. But we have found that the best way to learn them is to focus on them one by one. You will have a chance to see the skills demonstrated on the video tape. You will learn what makes each skill work. You will discuss each skill and how you could use it. Finally, you'll practice the skill yourself. I hope you'll find the program helpful. I firmly believe from my own experience as a correctional officer, that using these conflict prevention skills will make your day easier and will give you a greater satisfaction from your work. 

00:09:15
Skill 1 Attending 

00:09:15
RALPH PACKARD  In the course of a typical day at work, a correctional officer often finds himself faced with an inmate like Lewis who is upset for one reason or another. Maybe his parole has been denied. Maybe he's received bad news from home. The correctional officer's way of responding can either get the inmate more emotionally upset or can help to calm him down. 

00:09:45
RALPH PACKARD  Correctional officers often don't take the time to stop and listen to an inmate's problem. Yet stopping for a moment can often help the inmate let off some steam and prevent the inmate from getting more excited or taking his frustration out in a more destructive way. 

00:10:05
RALPH PACKARD Watch this interaction. This is when Officer Connors comes down to tell the inmate named Lewis that his public defender won't be showing today. 

00:10:15
CONNORS Lewis, I just got this note and it says your public defender won't be here today, okay? 

00:10:20
LEWIS Hey Connors. Come on. I was arrested two weeks ago. I mean, they've been telling me for the last five days, I can't even call what this guy's phone number. 

00:10:25
CONNORS It's not. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
LEWIS I gotta go to court with him in the morning. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
CONNORS  Hey, that's not, (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
LEWIS I don't even know what he looks like. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
CONNORS Hey, that's not my problem. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
LEWIS I don't know anything about the guy. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
CONNORS Hey! What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? 

00:10:35
LEWIS Can't you give me a phone number? (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
CONNORS I don't know his number. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
LEWIS Can't you do anything? (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
CONNORS I don't know his number. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
LEWIS Tell me what he looks like? 

00:10:35
CONNORS  I don't know what he looks like. 

00:10:40
LEWIS Jeez! What do they do, pay you around here just to deliver bad news? 

00:10:45
CONNORS Hey, good news, bad news doesn't matter to me. I'll deliver it. 

00:10:45
LEWIS Jesus! You ought to be a mailman. 

00:10:50
RALPH PACKARD What's going on here? How do you think Lewis feels right now? What's going through his head? Did you notice that Officer Connors didn't make eye contact with Lewis? Did you see how he backed off from Lewis without taking time to listen to what Lewis had said? 

00:11:05
RALPH PACKARD Let's look at this encounter again. This time Connors will be using the Attending skills. 

00:11:10
CONNORS  Lewis, I've got this note and it says here that your ah, public defender won't be here today. 

00:11:15
LEWIS  Come on Connors, what's going on in this place? I was arrested two weeks ago. I've been trying to work with this guy's phone number for the last five days. 

00:11:25
CONNORS Hey, I know you're upset, (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
LEWIS I mean. 

00:11:25
CONNORS but what can I do? 

00:11:25
LEWIS  I gotta go to court with this guy in the mornin' and I don't even know what he looks like. I, I, I don't know nothing about him. I can't even get his phone number. 

00:11:35
CONNORS Hey, I'll tell you what. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
LEWIS Doesn't anybody else in this, in this place to have this guy for a lawyer? 

00:11:40
CONNORS I think Lopez has him. I se, I can check with him later on for you, okay? Now, when I talk to him, I'll get back to you in about 15-20 minutes. 

00:11:45
LEWIS Anything, anything you can do. 

00:11:50
CONNORS Hey, like I say, I'll talk to him and see what I can come up with, okay? 

00:11:50
LEWIS  Gotta be. 

00:11:55
RALPH PACKARD Notice that this time, the officer takes time to stop and look at Lewis while he tells him the bad news. He keeps eye contact as they continue to talk. Connors is listening to what Lewis is telling him. Even the way Connors is seating gives Lewis a message that he's willing to hear him out. 

00:12:10
RALPH PACKARD  Did you notice that Officer Connors took time to stop and make contact with Lewis before telling him the bad news? Then he kept good eye contact with him as he listened to Lewis' response. As Lewis talked, Connors said a few encouraging things to show him he's listening and understands why Lewis is upset. Connors certainly isn't able to solve Lewis' problem but he is able to help calm him down by letting him get a few things off his chest. Attending is a very useful skill in working with inmates. A few moments spent hearing an inmate out when a problem first develops, can save a lot of time later on if pent up emotions turn into negative behavior. 

00:12:55
ATTENDING SKILLS 

00:12:55
RALPH PACKARD  Here are some key features of attending that you'll want to use when you practice. Establish eye contact. Looking at a person while you speak to him or he speaks, helps show that you're interested in hearing him out. Watch your body posture. Stop and take a minute to talk to the inmate. Don't give him information on the run. Don't walk away while he's speaking. Sometimes it even helps to sit down to talk. 

00:13:25
RALPH PACKARD  In regards to this first point, Body Posture, remember the non-verbal cues you give an inmate are as important as the things you actually say. Good eye contact, a relaxed body posture, a calm stance, all these things let the inmate know you're willing to hear him out. This helps reduce the possibility of a conflict situation and helps encourage the inmate to give you information you need about problem areas in the jail. 

00:14:00
RALPH PACKARD Stick to the topic. Don't cut the inmate off or change the subject while he's talking. Be aware of your tone of voice, stay calm even if the inmate isn't. Your tone of voice can help when an inmate's upset. 

00:14:15
RALPH PACKARD The Attending Skill is a difficult one to use in a correctional environment because usually there's very little time to sit and listen to an inmate talk. Also, the correctional officer is generally not in a position to be able to solve the inmate's problem. So listening to an inmate talk about it can feel frustrating and pointless. 

00:14:40
[sil.] 

00:14:40
RALPH PACKARD  The second skill focuses on asking questions effectively. Questioning is an important aspect of a correctional officer's work. The officer needs information from inmates but inmates are often evasive or reluctant to give the information needed. Sometimes the way a question is asked makes the inmate uptight or reluctant to cooperate. A question may be misinterpreted as an accusation and puts the inmate on the defensive. But asking questions, like listening, is a skill. Done well, information is shared readily. Done poorly, information is withheld. There are two different ways of asking questions. In conflict prevention training, we call them, "Open-Ended Questions" and "Close-Ended Questions". Close-ended questioning asks the inmate to respond in just a few words and give you just the information you request. These kinds of questions begin with words like when, how many and did you. Open-ended questioning is different. They ask an inmate to divulge more of what's on his mind. It's good to ask open-ended questions when you're not totally sure of the information you will get but when you believe there might be important information that the inmate has not yet revealed. Usually, this kind of question begins with words like, "Could you tell me a little bit about" or "How come". Both these kinds of questions are very useful in managing inmates. A trick to the skill of good questioning is to know when to use one kind of question or the other. Watch the following interaction. 

00:16:40
 Officer! 

00:16:40
JACK What's the problem, Turtle? 

00:16:40
 Ah, I got a problem. Ah, every night after lockup, this ah, comedian upstairs here in cell 25, he's playin' with matches and I think you ought to know about it. 

00:16:50
JACK What comedian? Who is he? 

00:16:50
 That guy up in number 25. That Johnny character, the new guy that just come in. 

00:16:55
JACK What is he doing? 

00:16:55
 He's lighting matches. I, I, I'm sittin' in my cell after lockup reading a book and I see these reflections in the glass. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
JACK Has anyone else seen him do this? 

00:17:00
 I don't know if anybody else has seen him but I'm concerned because if this place catches on flare, a lot of us would be killed. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
JACK Is he thrown, is he thrown matches at you? 

00:17:05
 No. He can't, he can't throw matches at me but I just don't want the place to catch on fire. 

00:17:10
RALPH PACKARD The first few questions the correctional officer asked here were close-ended questions. That means that they are meant to illicit very specific answers. Close-ended questions do have their place. However, close-ended questions can also cause problems. Let's listen in again. 

00:17:25
  He's. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
JACK Well, what, what the hell you botherin' me for about that? If he hasn't thrown a match at you, you don't. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
 What are you gonna do if this place burns down? (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JACK You don't. 

00:17:35
 You don't realize what's going on in here! (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
JACK No one else has complained about him but you. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
 That's not the point. I'm worried about myself. I don't care about these other guys. I mean, if you don't put, and stop this guy from lighting these flares, I'm gonna, I'm might ah, get caught near the fire. 

00:17:45
JACK Ain't got, no one else has complained. Has anyone else complained? (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
 Oh, forget it. 

00:17:45
JACK Has anyone else come (inaudible ) and filed a complaint about it? (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
 Forget it. Forget it. 

00:17:50
JACK Don't bother me about it. 

00:17:50
 I won't. 

00:17:50
RALPH PACKARD You see, close-ended questions, misused, can cut a person off, making him feel that you don't really want to know or even care about what he has to say. But the other way of asking questions is by using open-ended questioning. Let's watch the encounter replayed for different results. 

00:18:10
 Hey Officer, come on down here. Hey, Officer! 

00:18:15
JACK Yeah, what's up Turtle? 

00:18:15
 Hey, ah, I think you ought to, I don't know what's been going on in here lately. I don't know if you know it or not but I think ah, you ought to know. This guy upstairs, he's ah, he's playing with matches after lockup. 

00:18:25
JACK Who? 

00:18:25
 This guy up in cell 25, John, you know? The new guy come in last week? 

00:18:30
JACK Okay, I know who you're talking about. What is he doing? 

00:18:30
 Well, all I know is, ah, I know he's playing with matches. He's lighting papers on fire and I'm, I'm afraid if you don't put a stop to it, this place could catch on fire and we're all in trouble 'coz we won't be able to all get out. 

00:18:40
JACK Alright. When is he doing this? 

00:18:40
 He's doing it after lock up. Sometimes after 9 o'clock. Usually around 9, 9:30, 10 o'clock. Somewhere in that area. 

00:18:45
JACK Well, is he ah, is he, you know, is he throwin' the, throwin' fires down to your cell? (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
 No, he's not throwing fires down on my cells. He's just lighting papers in his cell. I think he's ah, I don't know. I think he's just trying to throw a little fear into me up there, you know? Ah, I don't know what he's up to. I couldn't tell you. If I knew, ah, I'd let you know. 

00:19:00
JACK What kind of problems are you having with this guy? 

00:19:00
  Well, I don't really think it's a matter of problems. I just think you ought to ah, you ought to have this guy looked at or maybe even move him out of this block. 

00:19:10
JACK Yeah. Would you like to be moved out of the block? 

00:19:10
 Not especially. I've been here ah, for quite a while. You've never had no trouble with me but I think this guy should go. Either that or have him checked out. He's, he's trouble and you're gonna have trouble with him sooner or later. 

00:19:20
JACK Well, what's going on? I can't move him unless I have, unless I have justification. 

00:19:20
 Well I'll tell you. I knew the guy and if you don't watch it, they guy is trouble. Sooner or later he's gonna cause trouble for you, he's gonna cause trouble for everybody in the block. I don't want nothing to happen. 

00:19:30
RALPH PACKARD Now that the officer's asking open-ended questions, the inmate is able to offer more information. In fact, the open-ended questions have turned up information very useful to the officer. By asking questions in this way, the inmate was more free to talk and the officer found out the truth in the matter. The man on the tier above is probably not lighting matches at all. Chances are there's a personal conflict going on here. So remember, close-ended questions start with words like did, when, where. They are useful when you know the nature of the information you're after and when you don't want to get involved in a lengthy conversation. On the other hand, open-ended questions start with words like how come, could you, tell me a little about. They are useful when you are trying to uncover information or problems you suspect may be lying just below the surface. 

00:20:35
Skill 3 Rephrasing 

00:20:35
RALPH PACKARD  When listening to an inmate describe a problem, it's helpful to let the inmate know that you understand what's being told. This technique often encourages him to continue talking and tell you more. It communicates your concern. Here the inmate could trust you more because you seem to understand his meaning. Rephrasing may sound simple, but it's not. It's a skill that can be misused. Improper rephrasing distorts the inmate's meaning and this might be perceived as an effort to suit the needs of the officer; or by rephrasing the inmate's words back sarcastically, it can be perceived as belittling their ideas or concerns. Remember, whenever you belittle an inmate or disregard what he or she is trying to tell you, you raise their level of frustration and increase the chance that a more troublesome problem will develop later. 

00:21:40
BERTHA  Listen, Officer Stern. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
STERN Yeah, what do you want? 

00:21:45
BERTHA Can you get me out of this, this infirmary? I can't work in here with this woman. This ah, nurse Jacobson's something. She's crazy. I'm telling you, I cannot. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
STERN Bertha, are you bitchin' again? 

00:21:55
BERTHA I can't work with that woman. Every time I do something, it's wrong and is always complaining about something I did. I've gotta get out of here. The detainees are giving me a hard time. I gotta get out of this place. I can't work in here. (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
STERN Bertha, what I'm hearing is you can't do the job for a change. 

00:22:05
BERTHA I don't know why I bother talking to you. Every time I talk to you, you know, you know, it's the same thing. You never listen. You don't hear what I'm saying. You just, you know, I gotta get out of here. I'm having a hard time. I'm getting my work release, I'm wanna get outta this place. 

00:22:15
STERN Bertha, you did the same thing when you were in the kitchen. 

00:22:20
BERTHA I've gotta get outta here. I'm telling you, I'm having a problem. Nurse, between the, the detainees always asking for something and, and nurse Jacobson giving me a hard time, nothing goes right, as far as she is concerned, nothing is right. (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
STERN What are you giving the detainees, Bertha? 

00:22:30
BERTHA  I'm not giving them anything. I said they try, they're asking for something. I didn't say I was. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
STERN That's not what I heard. You said what the detainees want from you and I hear you say you're giving them things. 

00:22:40
BERTHA I didn't say that. I said that they're always asking for things. I didn't say I was giving 'em anything. You know, that's the problem and I'm having pressure from them. I need to get outta here before I get into trouble. 

00:22:45
RALPH PACKARD  Officer Stern doesn't seem to care much, does she? She's moving away from the inmate before she even has a chance to tell her what's on her mind. When she does stop to talk to her, she doesn't really take her seriously. 

00:23:00
RALPH PACKARD  When she responds in a sarcastic way, that shows she really isn't listening carefully or perceiving the problem. Let's watch the scene replayed. 

00:23:15
BERTHA Officer Stern. Listen, (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
STERN Yeah, Bertha? 

00:23:15
BERTHA you have got to get me outta this medicare. This, nurse Jacobson is driving me crazy. (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
STERN Hey, calm down. 

00:23:20
BERTHA You know, she's constantly, this woman is constantly on my back. She complains about everything I do. Nothing is right, you know? I've got to get outta here. You know, I. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
STERN So, nurse Jacobson is riding you. 

00:23:30
BERTHA Yes. She's constantly complaining. She doesn't like me. I know she doesn't like me, you know. Between this woman and the detainees upstairs, I'm about to go crazy down here! You know. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
STERN So you're feeling you doing a good job but you're getting pressured from her and from the detainees. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
BERTHA Yes! Detainees constantly after me every evening, you know? I, I go upstairs and they wanna know where the stuff is, you know? They're asking me about bringing, bringing pills and stuff upstairs. I, you know, I know I can't do that and she's watching me. If I do it I'm, I'm gonna be in trouble, (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
OFFICE STERN So you're, (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
BERTHA my work release is gone. 

00:24:00
OFFICE STERN so you're afraid that you might sit, you might ah, give in. 

00:24:00
BERTHA Yes! I just might if I keep getting pressure from them like that. And between nurse Jacobson and the detainees, you know, I, I'm gonna blow the whole work release business. I gotta get outta here. 

00:24:10
STERN So you're coming up for work release? 

00:24:10
BERTHA Yes. 

00:24:10
STERN  Aha! So you're coming up for work release and you're afraid you're gonna foul up here. 

00:24:15
BERTHA Yes! I need you to get me outta here before something goes wrong. 

00:24:20
RALPH PACKARD Officer Stern repeated Bertha's words to her. She's able to gather the essence of what was said and then rephrase it and present it back. This encourages Bertha to take the next step in the conversation and allows her to talk about the real reasons she wants to change jobs. 

00:24:35
RALPH PACKARD The skill of rephrasing is useful in getting an inmate to probe his own motivations. Rephrasing is a way that the correctional officer can let inmates know he understands the underlying meaning of what they are saying. This skill is important in a correctional setting because it allows the correctional officer to help an inarticulate, fearful and confused inmate. In addition, when the officer forms and repeats key words and phrases in this manner, the inmate can identify a problem without having to spell out the details or divulge information that may get some other inmate in trouble. 

00:25:15
RALPH PACKARD  The main components of good rephrasing are: Get the essence of what has been said. To do this, it is helpful to use the attending skill. Repeat it back to the inmate in fewer words. Summarize his meaning. It helps to start with a phrase like, sounds like what you mean is. Be non-judgmental. A good job of rephrasing does not judge what an inmate said or attempt to analyze it. Check it out. End with the words, did I understand you correctly, or is that what you mean. If he answers yes, you know you've succeeded at gaining his confidence and that you understand him and are willing to hear him out. 

00:26:05
Skill 4 Identifying Emotions 

00:26:05
RALPH PACKARD  Emotions are a very important part of life in a correctional facility. Everybody is under pressure for one reason or another. People live close together and they don't have much opportunity to let off steam. Maybe it's because inmates are often subject to many disappointments in situations where they have little control. A letter from a girlfriend on the outside breaking off a relationship can send an inmate into a tailspin. It can cause him to lash out at another inmate or officer. 

00:26:55
RALPH PACKARD  There are numerous similar events large and small that leave emotions raw and put inmates under stress. When these emotions stay pent up, they could easily erupt into problems. Often, the eruptions turn violent; therefore, it's important that a correctional officer know how to spot when emotions are just under the surface and be willing and able to help an inmate talk about them and let off steam. Watch this following incident. Cruz is being processed in but the Booking Officer is getting nowhere because the inmate is worried about the injury to his wrists. 

00:27:35
 Now, what is your name? 

00:27:40
CRUZ I don't wanna answer any question until I see a doctor. 

00:27:40
 Yes you are. You're gonna answer these questions. Now, what's your name? 

00:27:45
CRUZ Why not? Don't you have doctors in here? 

00:27:45
 Yes, we have doctors here but you can't see him 'till you finish this form. 

00:27:45
CRUZ I, I won't answer any questions until I see a doctor. 

00:27:50
 You're not gonna answer this form at all? (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
CRUZ No! 

00:27:50
 Why not? (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
CRUZ I said I, I wanna call my lawyer. 

00:27:55
 Okay, I'll tell you what, (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
CRUZ I wanna call my lawyer right now! (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
 you're gonna answer these questions now, you're gonna ask 'em at our convenience so you better do it now. 

00:28:00
RALPH PACKARD There's no way the booking officer is going to able to accomplish what he needs to get done until he responds to the inmate's concerns and feelings. Let's watch the scene replayed. 

00:28:10
  Okay, sir, have a seat. 

00:28:15
CRUZ Look... (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
 Mr. Cruz. (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
CRUZ ...what this guy did to me. Look what this guy did to me. Look, it's bleeding! (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
 Okay, calm down. 

00:28:20
CRUZ It's bleeding! (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
 Calm down. 

00:28:20
CRUZ It's swelling in there. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
 Let, let me see, let me see what happened. 

00:28:20
CRUZ There's no need for that. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
 Calm down, let me see your wrist. 

00:28:25
CRUZ There's no need. 

00:28:25
 Let me see your wrist. 

00:28:25
CRUZ Swollen. You see it's bleeding? 

00:28:25
 Okay, I see it's bleeding there. We will have the medic look at you. 

00:28:30
CRUZ I wanna see a doctor. 

00:28:30
 But we have to complete this form first. 

00:28:30
CRUZ I wanna see a doctor. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
 Okay, I will let the medic look at you. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
CRUZ Do you have a doctor in here? 

00:28:35
 Yes we do. He's on duty 24 hours a day. 

00:28:35
CRUZ  There's no need for that. I have a little argument with my wife and here I am. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
 Okay, you seem a little upset, you're angry, you're confused. Is this your first time in an institution? In jail? (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
CRUZ The first time. Police handcuffed me in the back like a common criminal, (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
CRUZ can you hear it, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 What did you do? 

00:28:50
CRUZ My wife and I had an argument. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
CRUZ  Don't you have an argument with your wife? 

00:28:55
 I'm not married but ah, I've argument with my girlfriend. (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
CRUZ You never had an argument with your wife? 

00:28:55
 But anyway, I understand that your wrist is badly bruised, you really don't know what's gonna happen to you. Let me explain a few things to you first, okay? We have to complete this form. The fact that your wrist is bruised we will take you around to the medical unit. The medic will look at your wrist, give you whatever is needed for you to, to soothe the pain and then you'll be brought back to the processing area. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
CRUZ Okay. 

00:29:20
 Okay. And then from that point, we will assign you to a housing unit. 

00:29:25
CRUZ I would like to call a lawyer. 

00:29:25
  Okay, when you come back from the medical unit, before we assign you to a housing unit, I'll let you make a phone call. 

00:29:30
CRUZ Who'll I have to see to call a lawyer? 

00:29:35
 You have to see me. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
CRUZ You said, you? 

00:29:35
 You have to come back to see me. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
CRUZ Then you will take care of the doctor and the lawyer? (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
 Yes, I will. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
CRUZ Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
 But we have to complete this form first. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
CRUZ You're not giving me a lie? (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
 I'm not giving you a lie. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
CRUZ Take a look. 

00:29:40
 Yes, I see your wrist. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
CRUZ It's bleeding. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
  Right. 

00:29:45
CRUZ Okay. 

00:29:45
 Now, you wanna do this form now? I need your last name. 

00:29:50
CRUZ Cruz. C-R-U-Z. 

00:29:50
RALPH PACKARD It only takes him a moment to respond to an inmate's feelings. When the booking officer tells Cruz he understands his feelings about his injuries, Cruz calms down a bit. By identifying his emotions, bring them back and communicating them enabled the officer to proceed without any further disruption. 

00:30:10
RALPH PACKARD  Correctional officers often think they have to present a tough exterior to show inmates they can't be manipulated. But a moment of concern taking the time to express understanding can be a very useful tool in cooling down an explosive situation. A sad face, drooped shoulders, fist pounding, are all cues that an inmate is upset. A correctional officer should be able to observe these cues and respond to them. The skill of reflecting feelings consists of three parts. 

00:30:50
Identifying Emotions 

00:30:50
RALPH PACKARD Notice the inmate's feelings. Sometimes you have to be a detective and look for clues. Most people don't come right out and say it when they're upset. Respond by telling the inmate that you understand that something is bothering him. Reflect his feelings in words. 

00:31:10
Show concern by helping the inmate talk about his feeling 

00:31:10
RALPH PACKARD Show concern. Don't belittle an inmate for his feelings or make light of them. Remember, feelings are a sensitive area. Remember that the open-ended questioning technique is very useful here. When it comes to encouraging an inmate to talk about something that may be upsetting him, a phrase like, you seem upset today, or, something on your mind, can bring a problem out in the open so that the inmate can deal with it. Well, you have just completed the first half of Conflict Prevention Skill Training. The first half covered four communication skills: attending, asking questions, rephrasing, and reflecting feelings. These four skills are the basic building blocks of the Conflict Prevention Skill Program. The second half of Conflict Prevention Skills Training which you are now to begin, focuses on four other skills. These are called "Management Skills." While communication skills are meant to help you respond to inmates and deal with problems before they erupt, management skills are meant to help you in your day to day supervision of jail operations. These are: giving orders, advising, threatening punishment, and getting and evaluating information. These management skills help you, for example, to make sure inmates follow regulations and help you stay informed about what is going on in the block. 

00:32:55
Skill 5 Giving Orders 

00:32:55
RALPH PACKARD  The first management skill is called, "Giving Orders." The job of a correctional officer involves giving orders all day long. How you give an order, that is your tone of voice, your attitude, the way you explain what you want, all effects whether or not the inmate will cooperate. Giving an inmate an order reminds him of his powerless position in jail. Often, he will put up a fight just to express his anger. Overcoming this built-in resistance is not an easy task. It means you have to give your orders in a way that both shows respect for the inmate and shows him that you mean business. Watch the following interaction. Officer Williams has come to tell an inmate named Danny to clean up his cell. 

00:33:55
WILLIAMS Danny. 

00:33:55
DANNY Yeah. 

00:33:55
WILLIAMS I spotted your cell a few minutes ago. 

00:34:00
DANNY What about it? 

00:34:00
WILLIAMS You haven't cleaned it up yet. 

00:34:00
DANNY  Haven't cleaned it up yet? 

00:34:05
WILLIAMS I gave out orders two hours ago that the cells had to be cleaned by 12 o'clock. 

00:34:10
DANNY It's fine, as far as I can see. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
WILLIAMS You have a half an hour to get it done or you're gonna suffer the consequences. Buddy, I want that pigsty cleaned out. 

00:34:15
DANNY  It's no pigsty. Christ! You're always bitchin' about something. 

00:34:20
WILLIAMS What you talking about I'm always bitchin' about something? (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
DANNY That's right. 

00:34:25
WILLIAMS I gave out orders that the rooms had to be cleaned out... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
DANNY Ah, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
WILLIAMS ...and you, you're the only one in the fuckin' block who haven't cleaned the cell out! 

00:34:30
DANNY Hey, you and your orders. I'm sick of your orders. 

00:34:30
WILLIAMS I don't give a damn what you're sick of... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
DANNY  Christ. 

00:34:35
WILLIAMS ...as long as you're here, you're gonna do as I tell you to. 

00:34:35
RALPH PACKARD Did you notice Officer Williams' threatening a body posture as he gave the order? What does he convey in the way he stands here and talks to Danny? Officer Williams is leaving behind a very unresponsive and sarcastic inmate. Let's watch again. 

00:34:50
WILLIAMS  Hey Danny, how's it going? 

00:34:55
DANNY Hi, John. 

00:34:55
WILLIAMS I was by your cell a few minutes ago, man. 

00:35:00
DANNY What about it? 

00:35:00
WILLIAMS You haven't cleaned it up yet as, as was ordered this morning. 

00:35:05
DANNY It's clean. 

00:35:05
WILLIAMS Apparently, you haven't taken a good look at it lately. 

00:35:05
DANNY  Well, what's wrong with it? 

00:35:10
WILLIAMS Your basin is dirty, your toilet is dirty, your floors need to be cleaned and you have paper all lining your bars. 

00:35:15
DANNY Everybody has papers on their bars, John. 

00:35:20
WILLIAMS Not now they do. I gave orders two hours ago for all that to be cleaned up and you're the only one on the block who hasn't done it yet. 

00:35:25
DANNY Still I don't think my cell's dirty. 

00:35:30
WILLIAMS Hey, take my word for it. It's dirty. Now, if you want me to come down hard on you for not doin' it, hey, that's up to you, Buddy. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
DANNY Well, what are they gonna do to me? 

00:35:35
WILLIAMS  What could I do to you? You could risk getting your privileges taken away which includes your visits, commissary. (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
DANNY What? 

00:35:45
WILLIAMS Now, if you want that to happen, (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
DANNY All right(ph). 

00:35:45
WILLIAMS  I can get it done. 

00:35:50
DANNY I don't even have any supplies. 

00:35:50
WILLIAMS How is it every one else receives supplies and you didn't get any? 

00:35:55
DANNY I don't know. It's not my job to pass out supplies. 

00:35:55
WILLIAMS Give me a list of what you need and I'll get it to you because I don't wanna hear any excuses. You have a half an hour to get it done. 

00:36:05
DANNY What do you want done? 

00:36:05
WILLIAMS I want that basin cleaned, your toilet cleaned, your floors cleaned up and the, and the paper taken out of those bars. Now, do you understand what I want done? 

00:36:15
DANNY Yeah, I understand. 

00:36:15
RALPH PACKARD What do you think is making the difference here. Did you notice Officer Williams establish direct eye contact and stand his ground in a firm but non-threatening manner? Did you notice how the officer made sure that Danny had the correct information about what he was supposed to do? 

00:36:35
RALPH PACKARD Giving orders can go smoothly or can cause serious problems for the officer depending on how the order is conveyed. Use non-combative body posture, good eye contact and a calm tone of voice. 

00:36:50
RALPH PACKARD Say clearly what needs to be done and give the reasons why. Tell the inmate how to carry it out. And spell out the consequences of not following trough with your orders then check with the inmate to make certain that he understands what needs to be done and how to do it. 

00:37:10
Skill 6 Advising 

00:37:10
RALPH PACKARD  Every one needs to know if someone is concerned about him. Correctional facilities are often large bureaucracies and an inmate can feel like he's far removed from the decisions that control his life. Your job as a correctional officer sometimes means you need to give advice and even encouragement to inmates. When you praise or criticize an inmate, you help him understand what's acceptable behavior. The skill of advising means you help an inmate to look ahead and see the consequences of his good or bad behavior. When you know an inmate has been trying extra hard in order to get a good record for the Parole Board, it helps if you say something like, "Keep it up, you're doing a good job." By the same token, if you see that an inmate is headed for trouble, it helps if you say something like, "If you keep up this attitude, you're probably going to end up in a lockup." 

00:38:15
 Hey, Frank! 

00:38:15
FRANK  Yeah, Kent? 

00:38:20
KENT I got bad news for you. You didn't make work release last night. 

00:38:20
FRANK Hey Kent, where are you going? 

00:38:25
KENT What do you mean, where I'm going? 

00:38:25
FRANK Where are you going? I thought we had a deal. 

00:38:25
KENT What do you mean a deal? I made no deal. 

00:38:30
FRANK Three weeks ago! Three weeks ago, I talked to you. You said you could deliver that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
KENT No, no, no, no. You know I'm only one, (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
FRANK You told me that if I worked hard. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
KENT I'm only one man running that board. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
FRANK You told me. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
KENT Two other people out ruled me. 

00:38:35
FRANK You ain't got no weight in this place. 

00:38:40
KENT Of course I got plenty of weight. I got more weight than you. 

00:38:40
FRANK Then you're lying to me. One or the other. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
KENT  I don't lie. I never, (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
FRANK You told me if I worked hard down here. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
KENT I never lie. Especially to a chump like you. 

00:38:45
FRANK You told me that if I worked hard down here, you could deliver that. 

00:38:50
KENT Are you work. (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
FRANK What's the sense of working around here? I'm just wasting my time. 

00:38:55
KENT Listen, you've got two ways... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
FRANK That's it! (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
KENT ...to do the time in here: (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
FRANK No more! (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
KENT the hard way or the easy way. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
FRANK No more work for me. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
KENT You choose... (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
FRANK No! (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
KENT  to do the hard way, its up to you! (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
FRANK No more work for me. 

00:39:00
RALPH PACKARD Officer Kent's general attitude communicates to Frank that he doesn't really care about him. While the denial of work release is a disappointment for Frank and that he's ready to give up, Kent's attitude makes matters even worse. He doesn't remind Frank of the progress he's accomplished already. Officer Kent doesn't use the advising skill. 

00:39:20
RALPH PACKARD  There is no effort on Kent's part to pay attention to Frank's frustration or show empathy for his feelings. So in the end, Frank gives Kent the message loud and clear, he's going to make trouble from now on. 

00:39:35
KENT  Hey, Frank. 

00:39:40
FRANK Yeah, Kent? 

00:39:40
KENT I got bad news for you. Last night, you didn't make work, work release. 

00:39:45
FRANK Come on, Kent. What are you telling me? I thought. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
KENT I'm telling you what to happen last night. I was only one vote. 

00:39:50
FRANK Damn! You told me... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
KENT Calm down. 

00:39:55
FRANK ...three weeks ago. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
KENT Calm down Frank, calm down. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
FRANK You. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
KENT Don't blow it now. Don't blow it. 

00:40:00
FRANK Three weeks ago you told me down here that if I behaved, got my act together, that you could do this for me. 

00:40:05
KENT I say, I will try to help you and I did. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
FRANK Don't you have no weight? Don't you have no weight in this place? (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
KENT I got plenty of weight Frank, plenty of weight. But ah, you know, we talked about it, that I was only one vote in that committee. 

00:40:20
FRANK Oh come on. Jeez. I busted my ass down here. 

00:40:20
KENT I know you busted your ass. I know you're doing a good work. I want you to continue to do the go work, ah, good work. I want you to behave, take it easy. Don't blow it. Do, (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
FRANK All right. I, I just want. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
KENT do you know what, do you know what they want? They want you to blew it so they can come to me and say, "You see? You were wrong." 

00:40:35
FRANK  Where do I go from here? 

00:40:40
KENT Wait, let's talk about it. I know you are upset now. Let's talk about it tomorrow. 

00:40:45
RALPH PACKARD What's making a difference here? Did you notice how Officer Kent used the communication skills, particularly attending? Obviously, the decision on Frank's work release is out of Officer Kent's control. What he can do is to praise Frank for his progress and encourage him not to give up hope. Advising consists of three components. Define the positive and negative behavior clearly. Be very specific with the inmate about what you observe. State the future consequences of his behavior. A crucial aspect of revising is to point out the direction the inmate is heading. Make him aware of the results he faces, good or bad. Sometimes, it's very hard for an inmate to see beyond his immediate problem. You can help by helping him see the larger picture. Show your concern. The inmate needs to feel you are on his side. Remember, it's also important to continue to incorporate all the skills we've learned so far like attending, rephrasing and identifying emotions. 

00:41:55
Skill 7 Threatening Punishment 

00:41:55
RALPH PACKARD  There comes a time when an inmate just won't cooperate and you are left with nothing to do but to discipline him with lockup or some other withdrawal of privileges. But to be effective, you can only rely on punishment as a last resort; otherwise, you begin to lose your credibility. If you can't control inmates without threatening them all the time, you'll lose your respect of both inmates and officers. Punishment must be meted out carefully or it loses its value all together. Short of actually punishing an inmate, there is the threat of punishment. This means facing an inmate with a clear choice: Either you do what I tell you or I'm gonna lock you up or take other action. A threat of punishment allows the inmate one last chance to shape up. Used well, the threat can make it so you don't have to fall back on the punishment itself. It requires both your hope that the inmate will see the value of cooperating as well as your commitment to actually carry out your threat if he does not. But threatening punishment can backfire if you don't do it carefully. Watch the following incident. 

00:43:20
TURTLE Hey Officer! Hey Guard! Hey! 

00:43:25
 What do you want now, Turtle? 

00:43:25
TURTLE Where have you been? 

00:43:25
 I just came on. What do you mean, where I've been? (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
TURTLE I've been yellin' for about half an hour to get somebody down here. 

00:43:30
 Well. 

00:43:30
TURTLE Hey, I got a toothache that's killin' me. I'm telling you right now, you better do somethin' about it. 

00:43:35
 Oh, you got a toothache now. Yesterday it was a cold. Tomorrow... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
TURTLE Hey, look at it. 

00:43:35
  what could it be, huh? (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
TURTLE I don't wanna hear your nonsense. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
 Your such a pain in the ass. (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
TURTLE I'm tellin' you right now you better either get me some medication or take me to the dentist. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
 Hey, don't threaten me. Don't threaten me. 

00:43:45
TURTLE Hey, get me some medication or take me to the dentist. One or the other, (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
 Hey, (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:43:51
TURTLE I'm gonna make such a racket in this place you're gonna. (crosstalk) 

00:43:51
 Hey, did you put in your medical slip? 

00:43:51
TURTLE What medical slip? 

00:43:55
 A medical slip you have to submit to the doctor. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
TURTLE Hey, I don't want no, hey, that's nonsense. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
 Hey, that's the policy, that's the only way you're gonna see the doctor, huh? 

00:44:00
TURTLE Look it, if you don't get me some medication or... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
 Hey. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
TURTLE ...bring me to the dentist, I'm gonna create... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
 Don't, (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
TURTLE ...such a disturbance... (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
 don't threaten me. (crosstalk) 

00:44:00
TURTLE ...in here. You're gonna have real trouble. 

00:44:05
 Hey. Then you create a disturbance and you know what I'm gonna do? 

00:44:05
TURTLE What are you gonna do? 

00:44:05
 I'm gonna take away your visits and you're not gonna have the commissary. 

00:44:10
RALPH PACKARD Did you hear what the inmate said? He muttered, "If you don't get me some medicine, you're going to have real trouble." In this case, the officer intensified the situation and lost control. Let's watch the scene replayed. 

00:44:25
TURTLE Hey officer! Hey officer! 

00:44:25
  What's up, Turtle? 

00:44:30
TURTLE Hey man, where have you been? 

00:44:30
 Hey, I just got on duty. What's the problem? 

00:44:30
TURTLE I got toothache. Thing's killing me. 

00:44:30
  What's wrong? 

00:44:35
TURTLE I don't know. I'm not a dentist! 

00:44:35
 Well, how long had it been botherin' you? 

00:44:35
TURTLE Couple of days man! I can't sleep at night. 

00:44:35
  Well then, just submit to me, medical slip. 

00:44:40
TURTLE What medical slip? 

00:44:40
 You've got to submit a slip to see the doctor. (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
TURTLE I ain't got time for no medical slips man! 

00:44:45
 Hey, you've got one of two choices, you've got to submit the slip to see the doctor and if you don't you're not gonna see him. 

00:44:45
TURTLE  Hey, I don't know anything about me, medical slips. All I'm tellin' you if I don't get some medication or get to see the dentist, man, I'm gonna keep this whole block up. 

00:44:55
 You're not gonna keep this block up 'coz you'll be in isolation if you act up. 

00:44:55
TURTLE  Hey man, this. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
 If you act up, you go in isolation. From there you don't have or see your visits and you still have a toothache. 

00:45:05
TURTLE What's this medical slip business? 

00:45:05
 You gotta submit the slip to the doctor and in turn, he gets back to you and you can see him. 

00:45:10
TURTLE Well, I suppose if, I suppose I'll have to go that route then if I'm not gonna get no medication. (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
 Hey listen, I've always played it straight with you, haven't I? 

00:45:15
TURTLE Yeah. 

00:45:15
 Okay. Now, I'll take the slip to the doctor and then he'll get back to you, okay? 

00:45:20
TURTLE I suppose I'll have to do it that way then, huh? (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
 That's what you're gonna have to do. Its the only way. 

00:45:25
RALPH PACKARD This encounter didn't take any more of the correctional officer's time or energy than the previous one. But it did accomplish what the officer needed, which was to quiet down the inmate and prevent him from further disrupting the jail. The inmate insulted him, teased him, even implicitly tried to blackmail him. But even so, the officer maintained his cool, stood his ground and stayed calm. 

00:45:50
RALPH PACKARD  Threatening Punishment is made up of the following components. Stay calm. It's important to keep your cool in a situation like this but let the inmate know from your tone of voice and attitude that you mean business. Know what punishment you can actually give. Don't let yourself get into a situation where you threaten punishment that you can't deliver. Let the inmate decide. Just say once and for all what you want and then leave it to the inmate to decide whether he wants to cooperate or be punished. Leave him room to back down. Don't make this a contest of egos. People cooperate better if they feel they're not going to lose face. 

00:46:35
RALPH PACKARD  The skill of advising and the skill of threatening punishment are similar in some ways. They are both meant to make an inmate behave and take responsibility for his behavior. The key difference is that advising tends to focus an inmate towards a future punishment or reward while threatening punishment focuses on a here and now situation. 

00:47:00
Skill 8 Getting and Evaluating Information 

00:47:00
RALPH PACKARD  To maintain order in a correctional facility and on the block, you have to know what's going on there. You have to stay informed about conflicts brewing below the surface, about problem such as contraband entering a block, or disputes developing between different inmate factions. But getting this information isn't easy. Inmates see you in the negative and they're not likely to tell you much about what's going on. Even an inmate who would like to tell you about something like a gun or a knife on the block, fears for his own safety. He knows that if he does tell, he's going to get in trouble with other inmates. And there's also the problem that inmates sometimes want to trade you information for special favors. Once you start doing this, you put yourself in a difficult position. The whole problem of getting information and deciding whether it's true or not is one of the most complicated aspects of a correctional officer's work. Every correctional officer has to develop his own way of handling this. You have to learn to trust your instincts and you have to develop your own feelings about which inmate to trust. But it also helps if you make use of the four communication skills you've learned in the first half of this training program. Watch the following encounter. See if you can spot the places where the officer would have been more successful in handling the situation if he had used attending, questioning, rephrasing or reflecting feelings. 

00:48:50
JOHN  Hey listen, I wanna, I wanna talk to you, man, about the ah, shakedown they had last week upstairs. 

00:48:55
PETERSON  Right. 

00:49:00
JOHN You know, when they found all that shit? (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
PETERSON What about it? Yeah. What about all the shit they found? 

00:49:00
JOHN  Well listen, I know what, you know, I know where it's comin' from and how long its been comin' in. 

00:49:10
SGT. PETERSON Well, what, who, (chuckles) how long it's been comin' in, who's been bringin' it in and how's it been gettin' here... (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
JOHN I was, hey, wait, wait, hey, hey, (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
PETERSON ...'coz, you know, you're gonna make me look good, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
JOHN hey Sarge, listen man, you know, I will come off with no information if you can't help me. You understand what I'm saying? 

00:49:20
PETERSON What kind of help you want? 

00:49:20
JOHN You know, you know. I mean, you know what. (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
SGT. PETERSON What you want? 

00:49:20
JOHN Hey, listen, you know. Hey, these guys watching me and shit, you know? I mean, they, they know I'm talkin' to you man. If possible you get. (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
PETERSON  I'm gonna take care, I don't really care about the guys watching you. I just want to know how the stuff is comin' in here and make me look good and I'm gonna help you out. 

00:49:35
RALPH PACKARD Do you see what the officer's comin' on like he did not believe in the inmate? He isn't encouraging the inmate to talk or offer information. Let's watch the same replay. Keep an eye out for the communication skills. 

00:49:45
JOHN  Hey Sergeant Peterson, I wanna talk to you about something. 

00:49:50
SGT. PETERSON Hey Johnny, What do you want to talk about? 

00:49:55
JOHN Listen, ah, I have some information about that shakedown you had upstairs last week. 

00:50:00
PETERSON Yeah. Had a shakedown last week, ah, some things were found. Ah, what do you wanna talk about? 

00:50:00
JOHN  Well listen, I know who's bringing this shit in, you know? And I know, you know, how its gettin' through, you know. 

00:50:05
PETERSON  Uh hmm. Well, what do you know about what was found? Ah, what was brought in? 

00:50:10
JOHN You know wa, I know about, you know, couple of switchblades and, you know, the coke that they found, you know. I mean, hey, in fact, you know, if I gave you this information right now, in five minutes, you could, you could ah, you could bust these dudes 'coz they're right in the block, (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
PETERSON Right. 

00:50:25
JOHN you know. 

00:50:25
PETERSON But why are you tellin' me all these information? 

00:50:25
JOHN  Hey, well listen, you know, I mean, I'm short. You know? I mean it's possible I could get out on parole and they ain't talk about some, you know, they talk about some, you know, you're not goin' down with something, you know, and hear, you know, the bust out or somethin', you know, I don't want to be a part of it man. You know? I want, you know, if you could get me outta here, get me to another block, you know, let me lay until it's time... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
PETERSON Uh hmm. (clears throat) 

00:50:45
JOHN ...for that, you know. 

00:50:45
PETERSON  You mentioned somethin' about bustin' outta here and gettin' you to another block. Ah, what else is goin' on? 

00:50:50
JOHN  Hey, eh, hey, listen, you know, it's, you know, I'm, I'm lettin' you know this, you know, enough of this right now, you know? I, I can't tell you anymore than that, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
PETERSON Are you in fear of something? (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
JOHN I'm not sure, I mean, you're gonna be able to help me out or what? 

00:51:05
PETERSON Are you in fear of something? 

00:51:05
JOHN You know, wa, I don't wanna be a part of this, man. Don't you understand that? 

00:51:05
PETERSON  I understand that but there's some reason you're tellin' me this information other than a letter to a parole board. Now, what, what are you up for?(crosstalk) 

00:51:15
JOHN What, what, what I'm sayin' is, man, I don't wanna be a part of this man. I wanna get outta this block man. I don't wanna be here if something goes down, you know? 

00:51:20
RALPH PACKARD Did you notice the series of open-ended questions? Also, did you see how the officer built up trust? To get information, you must be prepared to listen. That means using the attending skill. If you watch for non-verbal cues as you listen, you may detect signs of nervousness that may cause you to judge whether or not you should trust the information you're hearing. The components of getting and evaluating information are: First use all of your communication skills then let the inmate lead the direction of the conversation. Watch non-verbal cues. An inmate will show with his body posture, eye movement or even tone of voice, things he will not actually say. Show the inmate he can trust you. It helps to hold this kind of conversation in private. Avoid making promises to deliver special favors in exchange for information. Getting information well relies on your ability to control the interchange between yourself and an inmate. Actually, you are in control by your effective use of Conflict Prevention Skills. Well, you have just completed Conflict Prevention Skill training. No doubt you are full of ideas and plans about how you might test out some of these skills in your work. At this time, I would like to share with you some of my personal feelings about Conflict Prevention Skill training. Prior to learning communication skills, I often found myself in conflict, not only with myself but with others in the course of my daily working routine. Along with that, I also had stress, tension, and the pressure of the correctional environment. After learning Communication Skills, not only did I find that it was easier to deal with the day to day problems which arise in the correctional field, but I also noted that there was a significant reduction in the stress and the tension which I had been experiencing. I also noticed that when I left the institution and went home, that it was easier for me to deal with the problems that were waiting for me at home. I hope that this training will have the same impact on your life as this had on mine. All of you officers will have to work these skills into your own style of working with inmates. The best thing to do is to experiment with these tools and talk them over with your fellow correctional officers. Try them, see how they work. Good luck.
