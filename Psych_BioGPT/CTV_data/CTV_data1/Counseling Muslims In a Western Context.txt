CASE 1 

00:00:00
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  At this stage, I would like to introduce three very short vignettes to share with you how Islam can be incorporated into the counseling process to make it more culture-specific for the client. The first vignette addresses a, an adolescent rebellion case where a child is feeling terribly oppressed because the parents are very concerned about her and that addresses the issues that the client is facing in terms of their faith and what their expectations are.

UNKNOWN [non-English narration]. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN  Welcome this morning to my practice. I understand that you've come here as a family to resolve or go over some issues. I need to know if you feel comfortable working with me as a therapist. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN We need to understand if you know Islamic laws and guidelines because we do need help but it has to be within our religion. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN Good point. Good question. I was brought up as a Muslim woman, so I understand Islamic laws and guidelines and tenets. And I feel that I'm able to work within that framework to help you and your family. So, can you just share with me what's been happening? Uh hmm. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN We have lived in the U.S. for 20 years and both of our children were raised here in the U.S. We are Sunni Muslims and have absorbed all the religious restrictions for child rearing. But suddenly, since Sarah turned 14, there is constant conflict in the house. She, she is so unhappy with us. She will not listen to us. She will not do her chores. She will not study. 

00:01:55
SARAH My mom is not telling you the entire story. My mom doesn't let me go anywhere. And my father, he listens to all of my telephone calls. I have no friends. It is totally unbearable living with my parents. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN You sound very frustrated. And I, and I pick up that as, as parents, you had enough of the conflict in the family. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN It's very difficult. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Very diff, very difficult. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN  Can you share with me why you've been so hard on her, so rigid within recent months? 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN Do you understand what a major responsibility a daughter is, in a, to Islamic parents? We, she is our, she is held in sacred trust for us until we hand her to her husband's family. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN  What have you shared with her about Islamic rules and guidelines ah, as a young woman? 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN  The children, the children were raised in Islamic practices from they were five years old. And they know how to be. I think Sarah understands what it is like to be a Muslim woman. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN I'm a little bit confused though. If you, if you've raised her in those rules and guidelines, what are your concerns about her behavior or what she knows as, what she should be as a young Mus, Muslim woman? 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN Let me, let me interject. We feel negative about outside influences. We hear so much about peer pressure and the results of negative peer pressure, and we're concerned about that on our daughter's behalf. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN  Sarah, do you understand at all why your parents are so concerned and worried? Perhaps, you can share with us what you believe a young Muslim woman should be like now. 

00:03:40
Debriefing Dr. Farah Ibrahim 

00:03:40
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  The first video that you just viewed is a family session, looking at an adolescent in crisis, trying to figure out why her parents are making her life so difficult. The parents are also in a crisis because they don't know how to communicate with her anymore about the, the regulations of their religion and what their expectations are as to her behavior. In this video, as I had pointed out earlier, the therapist is trying to put the onus on the client, on that, on that adolescent to take responsibility for the rules and regulations that she has acquired from age five up to now, to understand what her parents are trying to communicate and to respond appropriately to the situation. As I had mentioned earlier, if this doesn't work, I would recommend te, teaching them, ah, the Relationship Enhancements Therapy's model where you teach families how to communicate with each other to resolve conflict. Conflict is very common in intergenerational families that are, that include immigrants and first generation and second generation children. And it is rec, recommended that a conflict resolution model be used that teaches them communication skills and strategies so they can continuously work to clear the error and to move forward as a family. 

00:05:10
CASE 2 

00:05:10
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  The second vi, the second vignette addresses a couple's issue. It's a gender concern and a concern from a religious point of view for the family because each one has a different definition of what the role of the spouses is. 

00:05:30
Vignette #2 Role of Spouse 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN  [non-English narration] I understand that you are interested in resolving some issues and concerns that you have as a couple. 

00:05:40
AMINA  [non-English narration] 

00:05:45
HAMID I thought we were really compatible in college but now that we're married, Amina is really acting out. She doesn't wanna listen to anything I have to say or do. I just think she wants out in the marriage. 

00:06:00
AMINA I thought we were compatible, too, but when we start talking about anything, he acts like he's in charge. I don't know where that's coming from. It's a challenge for me. It's upsetting me. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Well, Hamid, just share to me what happens when you try talking about something as important to Amina. 

00:06:20
HAMID It's really simple. I'm in charge at home. And I believe that is important that Amina listens to me. 

00:06:25
AMINA Ha, see, what I mean? 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN What do you understand, as you're a man, as a role in the nation at Islam? 

00:06:30
HAMID I'm not sure, but I do believe that my father was a devoted Muslim and controlled everything. At least, I believe that everything was done according to what he wanted. And I think it should be the same way. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Well, when both of you had discussed marriage, what do you see as a role within each other? 

00:06:45
AMINA I'm just a devout Muslim as he is, but in my family, with my parents, they shared everything. They talked about religion and, ah, education, and finances and, and even their relationships. I'm not sure, Hamid has even read the Surah e, e Maryam and the holy Koran to know how we, as women, should be treated. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN  Well, it appears that both of you, all have different interpretations of what your relationships should be like. If you are interested in structuring it according to the tenets of Islam, I encourage you to review the religious guidelines and just come back next week. With the list of issues that you are, that's really important between you two. With Hamid, I understand that he's, has concerns of not being acknowledged by you, Amina. And with Amina, I hear that Hamid is not giving you respect or equity? 

00:07:35
AMINA Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN  So, again, I encourage you to have a list of your issues and concerns, and we can address this next week. 

00:07:45
AMINA Okay. 

00:07:45
HAMID Alright. 

00:07:45
De-briefing Dr. Farah Ibrahim 

00:07:45
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  The second vignette addressed a couple in crisis over their expectations on their gender roles. This is another very common situation that arises partly because when people move or, or are in the U.S. context, regardless of religion, they would like a more egalitarian relationships, especially women. And it creates a big burden for them to not be understood, especially when they thought they had it all clear. And what the therapist is trying to do is to help them work back within the tenets of the faith. When the client brings up, reviewing Surah e Maryam, Surah e Maryam is a 30-chapter, ah, 30-page chapter in the Koran that addresses the rights of women and how they should be treated, it clearly outlines the equality of the genders as, when they work as couples, and she is bringing that issue up for them to include in the process. And the therapist included that and wanted to work on that and gave them the homework assignment to come back and address the issue. 

00:09:05
CASE 3 Dr. Farah Ibrahim 

00:09:05
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  And the third case addresses an individual counseling session with a client who is Muslim, who's having sev, severe, uhm, severe, very severe response to 9/11 in terms of the persecution of Muslims and how they are being treated. 

00:09:25
Vignette #3 Post - Traumatic Stress 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN  [non-English narration], Rahima. 

00:09:35
RAHIMA  [non-English narration] 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Can you tell me what has brought you to counseling today? 

00:09:40
RAHIMA  Uhm, (sighs) since 9/11, I've been having a really, really hard time. Uhm, I, I've listened to what happens on the news. Ah, maybe I'm being paranoid or maybe I'm a bit crazy, but I hear how Muslims are treated here and in other countries, and I'm scared. And I don't sleep very well and when I sleep, I have nightmares. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. It has obviously been a very difficult time for you. Has the threat of the feeling about it, ah, has it subsided over time? 

00:10:30
RAHIMA  Hmm. No. Actually, it's gotten worse instead of better. I see what happens on the news. I see how Muslims are treated here. Uhm, and I think that no, nobody here believes Muslim can be a good Muslim. And they think that because I am a Muslim woman, it doesn't make me American, like I don't love my country. I think even my boss looks at everything I do, like as if, he's trying to uhm, find that I made a mistake, as, as if I can't be a Muslim and still love my country. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Hmm. That's very difficult. 

00:11:35
RAHIMA  Yeah. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Can you tell me another time when you had difficult times, or your, your family went through some tough times? Can you tell me how you coped with it? 

00:11:50
RAHIMA Uhm, sometimes, when I was a kid, my mom and dad would recite the Surah e Yaseen. It's a prayer. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
RAHIMA And I remember feeling good after the prayer, and feeling safe. They tell me it was gonna be okay, whatever it was, and eventually, I just fall asleep. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN  Hmm. Have you tried saying that prayer whenever you're having difficulty sleeping or the nightmares or feeling anxious? Perhaps, it might help. 

00:12:25
RAHIMA  No, I, I, I haven't. I didn't even remember it until now. Maybe I should try it. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN  Hmm. I encourage you try it. I really do. And then we can possibly explore some other ways to help you get through this stressful time. 

00:12:45
RAHIMA I'll try it. [non-English narration] 

00:12:50
Debriefing Dr. Farah Ibrahim 

00:12:50
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  The third culture-specific vignette addresses an individual counseling case where the client apparently has post-traumatic stress type symptoms from the aftermath of 9/11 and the treatment of Muslims in the country. In this situation, the counselor is trying to bring her back to her previous coping skills and also, in a way, trying to assess her commitment to Islam to see where and what kind of strategy would be most effective. And the client brings up the issue of Surah e Yaseen, being a significant prayer as a child that helped her when she was having nightmares, and they used that as the initial strategy to start an intervention. This solidifies the counseling relationship and also helps the counselor open up other avenues of coping and assisting the client with meditation and deep muscle relaxation and all the other methods available to us.

00:13:55
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM  Hello. My name is Farah Ibrahim, and today, we are talking about counseling Muslims in a western context. Ah, first of all, I think we should look at the demographics of the Muslim population, which is a very difficult matter since there are so many different reports on what the numbers are. However, I will try to go over some of the numbers that I've been collecting data on. Uhm, it is reported by the Religious Tolerance.org that there are 1.2 billion Muslims... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:15:35
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM ...ah, that represent about 22 percent of the world's population. And Islam represents the second largest religion in the world. It is led by Christianity, which is first, which has about 33 percent of the world's population as its followers. Further, Islam is growing at a rate of 2.9 percent per year, with the world's population growing at 2.3 percent annually. So, in North America, the estimates are kind of fuzzy. Ah, what, what I've been able to gather is that the estimates ranged from three million to nine million Muslims in the United States. Ah, Religious Tolerance.org reports that the numbers of Muslims in the, in the U.S., actually, are between 1.6 million to 7 million. Uhm, the World Almanac reports that there are 5.78 Muslims in the U.S. And a Muslim sociologist notes that there are 6.7 million. So, the figures are all over the place. Ah, the issue that we are looking at right now is that the population is changing and has been changing, of the number of Muslims in this country based on where the latest fate of wars have been. Ah, they are, ah, considered, considerably large number of Afghanis now in the U.S. and they are coming here post, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and then the post-Taliban era. And now, because the United States is in Afghanistan, are trying to help get rid of the Taliban. The second big influx that has been coming in are Iraqi refugees and this number is going to continue to increase. So, our preparation to work with this population ah, needs to be addressed. Uhm, in addition, in, in cultural issues in counseling and psychotherapy, our focus for the last 30 to 35 years has been on ethnicity and social class along with gender, but we really have not paid attention to issues of faith and how that influences the counseling process or should be incorporated into the process ah, given that religion also shapes our cultural values and beliefs. Uhm,- 

00:18:00
Other Statistics Numan (1990) notes that a little more than one-percent of the U.S. Military is Muslim. 

00:18:00
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM - there's a significant -number of, ah, Muslims that are in prison and most of these are actually, ah, thi, 30 percent of, of the Muslim population in the U.S. is in jail, and why there's, there's such a high number? It is mostly African-American, ah, prisoners that are converting to Islam in the tradition of, uhm, Malcolm X and, uhm, H. Rap Brown. So, they are influenced by their philosophical leaders who converted to Islam. And so, this is one, one of the largest populations and it's all incarcerated. 

00:18:40
Other Statistics (Numan, 1990) 

00:18:40
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM Muslims are mostly concentrated in major metropolitan areas. Ah, there are large populations in California. Ah, California has about 20 percent of the Muslims in this country, 16 percent are in New York, 8 percent are in Illinois, New Jersey and Indiana have about 4 percent and Michigan, Virginia, Texas and Ohio have about 3 percent. And most of the time, when new immigrants come, they flock to these major metro areas, and mostly, seeking a sense of community with the few that had arrived before. Ah, in the U.S., the ethnic origin of Muslims is reported to be pretty varied. Two-thirds of all Muslims in the U.S. are immigrants and their descendants. According to the American Muslim Council, 42 percent of all Muslims in the U.S. are African American, 24 percent are South Asian and 12 percent are of Arab origin. Faith Communities Today reported, in 2001, the ethnic origin of Muslims who regularly attend mosques, this being, ah, an index of their religiosity. South Asians, which includes Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis, and Afghanis, ah, 33 percent of them attend mosque on Fridays, for the, that's the group congregational prayer. African Americans, 30 percent attend mosques; Arabs, about 25-percent; Sub-Saharan Africans, about 3.4-percent. And European Muslims where Bosnian, Tartar, Kosovar, et cetera, 2.1 percent; Caribbean Muslims, 1.2 percent; and Turkish, 1.1 percent; Iranian, 0.7 percent and Hispanic or Latino Muslims, 0.6 percent. 

00:20:35
Information on Professions 

00:20:35
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM In 1997, Muslims were in several diverse professions. Engineering and Computer Science employed 10 percent of Muslims, medicine related fields employed 8 percent, financial fields 4 percent and Muslim income reported by Ba-Yunus ranged from 32,000 to 69,000, and this was in 1977. The Arab Muslim family was ha, highest at 69 percent and the African American Muslim family had the lowest income at 32,000. I would like to shift my focus to now understanding the basic tenets of Islam. So, as, there's some basic belief that Islam has that, I think, most people don't understand or recognize since people don't know much about the religion in the United States. Uhm, number one, this is a monotheistic faith, so, there's a belief in one God. There's an acceptance of all the prophets, starting with Moses, Abraham, Jesus, and the final prophet is Mohammad. There's a belief in the ten commandments, and Islam is considered the final link in the chain from Judaism to Christianity. Muslim believers range from basic ritual belief in Islam to philosophical assumptions. The philosophical end of Islam is called Sufism. There are five pillars of Islam. Ah, the first one is faith which is Iman. Ah, the second is prayer, which must be done five times a day. The third is fasting, which is, ah, called Ramadan. The fourth is charity called Zakat. And the final is the pilgrimage to Mecca or the Hajj. These five areas must be observed by practicing Muslims. And at least once in their lifetime, they must go to Mecca to complete the Hajj. Ah, there are several issues that are very important to Muslims, ah, and number one, puberty is the onset of adulthood, so, there is no adolescence. They go from childhood to adulthood. The Islamic marriage certificate asks about an individual's marital status and the three categories that are listed are never married, divorced, or widowed. If a person is never married, ah, especially, a woman, although chastity is demanded of both genders, the woman must be a virgin. And there are many different cultural ah, assumptions around that and some marriages end right away if there's a belief that this, the person that they married was not a virgin. And it was stated in the certificate that she was never married before. The roles that men and women take on ah, generally, are very clear. Ah, the gender roles are clearly co, compartmentalized. Men take care of everything outside the house, and which includes earning a living (laugh). And women take care of everything inside the house, which is child rearing, ah, food preparation, ma, maintenance of social relationships, et cetera. The most important function that a woman performs is the transmission of the faith and culture to the children. She is the primary educational agent. So, what are the acculturation issues for immigrant Muslims in the U.S.? Ah, and I would think that a lot of Muslims that were born here, ah, that may have converted to Islam, ah, some of these issues are common, simply given that they have to address certain func, rituals that are part of the faith. And so, the first one is alienation. 

00:24:20
Acculturation Issues for Immigrant Muslims Alienation Clash of cultures Child rearing Marital concerns Family and gender roles Interaction with school/community Identity crises (coming from home culture as the dominant group to non-dominant group in the US) Post 911-trauma in response to negative stereotyping Help seeking behavior 

00:24:20
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM Because they don't congregate in the, in the same temple or church as other people in this country, ah, they do feel alienated from mainstream populations. Ah, there's a clash of cultures when it comes to child rearing, uhm, the rules may differ, ah, a lot of this comes not from the faith but from the culture that the people are coming from because Muslims can be from any part of the world. And so, their beliefs about child rearing vary. There's also, in acculturation, marital concerns, uhm, if a man loses his job and he, and the wife has a job, that can become a huge issue because, uhm, as I noted earlier, depending on the culture of the client, ah, it's a huge issue because the man feels like he is now, not worthy of respect. And so, that creates problems in marriages. And this is pretty common for most immigrant groups. This is not just very specific to, ah, Muslim immigrants. Uhm, there's also, ah, the clash of values when Muslim families interact with the schools and the community. And actually, Canadian psychological literature has addressed a lot of these. Uhm, we have not addressed much of these in the U.S. Other acculturation issues pertain to the identity crisis that is created when people move from a dominant cultural group in their own country to the U.S. where they become a non-dominant cultural group and part of an ethnic minority group. Ah, the second issue that has come up since 9/11 has been of exclusion and, ah, a lot of trauma is associated with the, the way people are treated because if they have a Muslim name, they are treated as if they are Arabs or they're terrorists. And so, people have living, ah, they are living in a lot of fear right now, so, that's a huge issue, and that may be a focus of attention. And one of the vignettes in our, ah, series of, in, with this lecture is tied to that case of dealing with the trauma of exclusion and emotional abuse or even physical violence, ah, based on the perception of being a terrorist. And another issue for, under acculturated Muslim immigrants would be help seeking behavior. As I explained in one of the vignettes, ah, people do not go to professional counselors in most of the countries that they're getting the immigrants from. They go to their family or elders. And so, in this culture, when there's a crisis, people have to seek help from an outside person and that is a very difficult thing for people to do. So, so, how should we be doing an assessment for Muslim clients? I feel that there are several areas that we need to look at before we can actually launch into the counseling process. And primarily, because there's so much that we don't understand, and I think, the, the more clarification we have, the better job we can do in helping the client find a solution that will work for them. 

00:27:25
Assessment for Counseling Muslim Clients Native or immigration status 

00:27:25
DR. FARAH IBRAHIM The first one is to do a cultural identity assessment. And this includes looking at their racial and gender identity and doing an evaluation of that. The second aspect would be, ah, to do a worldview assessment where we look at their beliefs, values and assumptions and try to understand what kind of cultural context and worldview do they have because the context pertains to the background they're coming from, but every individual does not reflect the, the culture of a whole nation. There's a lot of variations within cu, within the culture that we need to understand because we are dealing with a specific client. The third issue that I think we need to evaluate is the acculturation level of the individual. Acculturation to Western culture can be a very, very complex situation for most people, simply because, even if they were born here or they're part of a non-dominant group, say, they're African-Americans, they already have a different cultural context, and now, they are further isolated because they have a faith that is not part of the mainstream. So, we have to look at how are they relating to the world and, and, do they even comprehend a lot of the issues that mainstream America takes for granted. And, uhm, so, part of the process is to help them see how they could modify some of their behaviors to be more accepted. Ah, I'm not talking about modifying basic values because I think that would be cultural malpractice. Here, I'm addressing the issue of helping people cope socially with the requirements of this society, so they are more functional on the job or in their everyday life when they are encountering other people that are different from themselves. In looking at the assessment of cultural identity, I have several variables and most of these spin off of my cultural identity checklist. 

00:29:25
Life stage and age 

00:29:25
FARAH IBRAHIM And it's in the chapter, in McFadden's text on transcultural counseling. So, the assessment of cultural identity, we should be looking at, number one, their spirituality. If they're Muslims, what level of commitment do they have to Islam? Because just being a Muslim, one can be at, at any level, from, say, a scale of one to ten, uhm, European Muslims, have very little ah, identification with the faith. And so,- 

00:29:55
Ethnic Origin of Muslims in the US Faith Communities Today (2001) reported the ethnic origins of Muslims who regularly attend Mosques: South Asians (Pakistanis, Indian, Bangladeshis and Afghanist) 33%; African American 30%; Arab 25%; Sub-Saharan African 3.4%; European (Bosnian, Tartar, Kosovar, etc.) 2.1%; Caribbean 1.2%; Turkish 1.1%; Iranian 0.7%; and Hispanic/Latino) 0.6%. 

00:29:55
FARAH IBRAHIM - as we saw in the statistics on attending the mosque, ah, they're in the lowest numbers. So are the Iranians and, uhm, the Latino and the, and the Caribbean, ah, Muslims. So, we have to understand, is this just a label or is it something like a very strong religious commitment? 'Coz the level of religiousness will influence the outcomes that they will seek and the solutions that they come up within counseling. The second issue is to assess their gender identity. Ah, this is a huge issue because obviously, when people come from India, we have to understand and recognize that India actually acknowledges three genders, and in the U.S., there is only a concept of two genders. And a lot of people, when they feel political oppression and social and emotional oppression because they're transgendered, come to the U.S. and try to build a life here because what they've heard and read through the movies and the literature and the TV shows is this, that this is a much more accepting society. So, gender identity assessment must be done and of, of course, counseling, the outcomes must be, must fit the, the gender identity of the client. Ah, again, we must look at their ethnicity, their culture and race. Ah, we also should be evaluating how many languages does the client speak. And, ah, what does, what this means for them. I know this is a complex issue because a lot of times people think of what difference would that make. However, language actually denotes our philosophical assumptions, the kind of words we used and how we use them. They, they are actually tied to a person's philosophy of life or their way of looking at the world. So, assessment of their languages and the kind of words they use is really important to understand, ah, their emotional state. Social class is another variable. And then I, I'd also like to look at their ability and disability status. And, uhm, I've already addressed the acculturation level before but the last thing is worldview. So, for the worldview assessment, I encourage people to use ah, either some kind of backdrop for values scale like the worldview instrument that, that I've created, the scale to assess worldview, which helps me understand the client on full levels, their full, very specific worldviews that can emerge when we use that scale to assess worldview. And, the first one is optimistic. The second is traditional. The third is a very here and now kind of perspective. And the fourth is a pessimistic worldview. This will also help us clarify how the client maybe wanting to solve their problems rather than just assuming that they would want what my worldview is, that their, their solutions should be fitting that. We also have a bias in U.S. culture where we value the optimistic worldview but everybody may not be there culturally, so I have to work within the client's assumptions. And in terms of acculturation level, there are several instruments that exist. However, I find that, for a lot of recent immigrants, we don't have anything that, that conforms to their culture. We have very specific ones but non-dominant U.S. ethnic groups. But, ah, for immigrants, I recommend using the scale of one to ten, trying to understand against mainstream assumptions. Mainstream America is represented by the schools, the media, the community, and how the people are conducting themselves in that, if I, if, if I looked at that and then I looked at the client in terms of how they relate to the world, I should be able to get a rough measure. This, this will help us in determining if our generally accepted therapeutic strategies will work or not for the specific client, because I'm coming, obviously, then I'm using Western therapeutic approaches, I'm coming from a specific worldview. And I have a set of assumptions inherent in that. So, what could be some applicable counseling theories? And I wanna clarify something here? I think that microskills is a very powerful mode to use. So, before we get to theories, I would like to mention that the skill component is very important. I can have a lot of different theoretical assumptions but I, if I don't have the skills to communicate with the client, I am going to fail miserably. So, the first thing in knowing, looking at applicable counseling theories is to know that all cultures of the world have healing systems. So, similar to us, other cultures have theirs. And I have to find what is meaningful to the client and use that system with this client. So that means I have to ide, help identify what is a powerful way to be on a cultural, in their cultural world. What would healing represent? And then to use Western theories that match the client's assumptions before I actually start using them. And cultural assumptions can be clarified by listening carefully to the client's narrative and explicating their values as they tell their story about their world and what, what they're dealing with. There's one other element. If the person is really very religious, I would ask you to focus on spiritual empathy. And this is really important for people that are highly relis, religious. And I've noticed a very interesting phenomena, that as things have been, ah, getting more and more, uhm, polarized between the West and Mu, and Muslims, a lot of Muslims who weren't even very religious are now becoming much more religious. So, it's a difficult thing to understand why, but I think, in a way, they're trying to protect themselves through their faith and maybe going deeper into their spirituality. So, there are some keys to spiritual empathy that I'd like to talk- 

00:36:05
Spiritual Empathy 

00:36:05
FARAH IBRAHIM - to you about. Ah, number one, I must have a knowledge of spiritual assumptions in a global context. I must understand, at least, superficially, all the different ways that, ah, the, the different religious traditions are shaped and, and set up. And also understand them within cultural context because religions are generally mediated within specific cultures. And, and the key to integrating spiritual issues in the counseling process is number one, to incorporate the worldview information into the counseling process to respond with empathy to spiritual traditions of the other. And secondly, to understand how my own worldview, and spiritual beliefs, and culture may facilitate or obstruct communication in this process. So, additional issues to consider in spiritual empathy are to recognize that counseling issues pertaining to psychological health and well-being, or physical health, or emotional health, or spiritual health and well-being are all connected. We have to integrate positive spiritual images to resolve, or help resolve the client's core value conflicts, and also achieve higher level of spiritual consciousness and awareness through empathy. So, both the client and the counselor glow, grows with this process. And we must also learn to recognize culture-based differences in a client's spirituality and integrate these differences into culturally relevant and sensitive counseling strategies. Thank you, and we can now shift to the vignettes.

Dr. Farah Ibrahim 

00:37:40
FARAH IBRAHIM  In this vignette, ah, I was trying to portray, ah, what my focus should be when I'm working with a recent immigrant or somebody that is new to this culture. Although, Zyra(ph) has been here five years, she is dealing with a sit, sit, situation that involves going to see a third party. She comes from a culture that does not have professional counselors or trained psychologists that work with people. Most of the time, these issues are resolved within the family and talking to trusted elders, ah, in this case, like it's a issue that is, you know, she's dealing with this, pertains to, ah, maternity and child issues. She'd probably be talking to her grandmother or grandmother and grandfather and then they would help them solve the problem. So, what I'm trying to do is to help her understand what my role is, ah, that I will help her try to find a solution within her world and then at each juncture, I'll try to take the conversation back to her culture. And we have a slightly more complex situation here, where we have peop, two people from two different cultures who have the faith in common, basically. So, we have a cross-cultural encounter along with, within the relationship, along with them having a cross-cultural encounter with me as a Western-trained therapist that is going to help them. 

00:39:05
Counseling a Recent Immigrant 

00:39:05
FARAH IBRAHIM  Hello, Mrs. Sahid(ph). My name is Farah Ibrahim. 

00:39:10
ZYRA SAHID Hi. 

00:39:10
FARAH IBRAHIM And you can call me Farah. 

00:39:15
ZYRA SAHID Alright. 

00:39:15
FARAH IBRAHIM I'm happy that you could come in and see me. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ZYRA SAHID Yeah. 

00:39:15
FARAH IBRAHIM And I know you're dealing with a very personal issue but what, the way I would like to start this discussion is, I would like you to ask me any concerns or questions that you may have about me or the process of counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
FARAH IBRAHIM So that you can be comfortable with the process. 

00:39:30
ZYRA SAHID Uhm, okay. Uhm, well, thank you for seeing me. I appreciate it. Uhm, I had spoke with, on my issue with, ah, Dr. Ken. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
ZYRA SAHID And, uhm, he had told me that he has referred, ah, many of his patients to you. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
FARAH IBRAHIM That's true. 

00:39:45
ZYRA SAHID And so, I'm hoping that you would be able to understand, uhm, ah, with my culture and my family beliefs. And, uhm, but, what I'm just wondering is, uhm, how would you be able to understand me if you don't know, uhm, about my beliefs or my values that I have? What's your prac, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Well, it's a very legitimate question. Uhm, the way counseling works is, and the way I work, ah, with clients is I have them share with me, ah, their basic values, assumptions, their cultural values and also, their religious beliefs and assumptions. And what we try to do is work with, ah, within your cultural context, work with a solution within it. Because primarily, this is a decision that's, generally, a very important life-changing decision that people make in counseling, that is something you have to be able to live that for the next thirty, forty, fifty years, the rest of your life. And my job is to be a facilitator of the decision-making process and to ensure that your decision is within your world, meaningful in, within your world. And so, that's the way I'm going to be working with you and it's going to involve a lot of work on your part. 

00:40:55
ZYRA SAHID  Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
FARAH IBRAHIM You will have to educate me. And also, it requires for you to let me know when I'm misunderstanding the construct that you're trying to explain to me because that's the only way we can arrive at some good solutions for you. 

00:41:10
ZYRA SAHID Okay. Uhm, well, I appreciate you, uhm, explaining to me... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
FARAH IBRAHIM Sure. 

00:41:15
ZYRA SAHID ...and how you approach things and, (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
FARAH IBRAHIM  Sure. 

00:41:20
ZYRA SAHID because I've just been really worried and, (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
ZYRA SAHID and nervous and very hesitant to tell my issue to somebody outside of my family, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
FARAH IBRAHIM Absolutely understandable. Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
ZYRA SAHID Yeah. So, it makes me very nervous. 

00:41:30
FARAH IBRAHIM Yeah. Absolutely. So, are you feeling comfortable enough or do you have other issues you would like to explore with me prior to sharing what has brought you to counseling? 

00:41:40
ZYRA SAHID No. I feel that I can probably tell you about what... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
ZYRA SAHID ...is on my mind. Uhm, my problem is, uhm, that, that I can't have children. 

00:41:50
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
ZYRA SAHID And I just went though the last series of tests. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, okay. 

00:41:55
ZYRA SAHID Uhm, and, uhm, I was hoping that the doctors would tell me otherwise. 

00:41:55
FARAH IBRAHIM  Uh hmm. 

00:42:00
ZYRA SAHID But, so, I'm very, uhm, I'm just very scared to tell my husband and I just don't know how to tell him. 

00:42:05
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
ZYRA SAHID And, and what's gonna happen after that. 

00:42:05
FARAH IBRAHIM  Wow, this is a huge crisis then. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
FARAH IBRAHIM So, basically, at this point, he doesn't know, and you're aware of the situation that you can no longer even plan to have children? 

00:42:20
ZYRA SAHID  Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
FARAH IBRAHIM So, how does this affect your relationship and what does this mean within your cultural context? 

00:42:25
ZYRA SAHID  Well, uhm, since, you know, the start of the test, uhm, I have just been very depressed... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
ZYRA SAHID ...and I'm just devastated. 

00:42:35
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, yeah. 

00:42:35
ZYRA SAHID And, uhm, with, uhm, you know, I mean, I wanna have children and my husband, Hamid(ph), also wants to have children. 

00:42:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
ZYRA SAHID And within the, uhm, Islamic life, ah, a wife cannot have children, (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
ZYRA SAHID he can leave me and marry a woman who can bear his children. 

00:42:50
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
ZYRA SAHID And so, this is just devastating to me that, uhm, that he'll leave me and I'll be alone for the rest of my life. And, (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, my goodness. Yeah. 

00:43:00
ZYRA SAHID you know, I guess we'll not know, uhm, what to do and then it'll be shameful to him, uhm, within our, our cul, our culture because his manhood will be questioned. 

00:43:10
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
FARAH IBRAHIM So, I'm, I don't know if we should even be looking at such a drastic outcome such as him leaving you, ah, but I understand what you're trying to tell me about your culture, ah, I think we, to understand how the relationship will proceed from hereon, we need to really look at your relationship, your marital relationship. (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
ZYRA SAHID Okay. 

00:43:30
FARAH IBRAHIM How would you define your relationship with Hamid? 

00:43:35
ZYRA SAHID We've been married for five years. (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
FARAH IBRAHIM  Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ZYRA SAHID And I think we have a pretty good relationship. 

00:43:40
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
ZYRA SAHID Uhm, initially, when we were first married, we were, ah, very, ah, very romantic with each other. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
ZYRA SAHID And we just uhm, focused, we just want to focus on each other. And, uhm, but lately, though, though, we've had pressure from both sides of our families to have children. 

00:43:55
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:43:55
ZYRA SAHID And so, within the past five years, they've seen that, uhm, you know, there's no children. 

00:44:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:44:00
ZYRA SAHID I haven't had, ah, I haven't had, ah, been pregnant. 

00:44:05
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
ZYRA SAHID And so, uhm, I just feel, and, that maybe Hamid is emotionally withdrawing and... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
FARAH IBRAHIM  Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
ZYRA SAHID You know, he maybe sensing that I can't have children or something, I don't know. Does this, it's not like it used to be. 

00:44:20
FARAH IBRAHIM So, the relationship has been stressed lately? (crosstalk) 

00:44:25
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
FARAH IBRAHIM And also, along with that, you've been depressed. So, I think that, that hasn't probably helped it. 

00:44:30
ZYRA SAHID Not really. 

00:44:30
FARAH IBRAHIM So, since both of you are really committed to having children and having a family, would you consider adopting? 

00:44:35
ZYRA SAHID  I'm not sure. I'm kinda scared to face the possibility that my marriage just will end because I can't have children. (crosstalk) 

00:44:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, I understand. That's a huge crisis. 

00:44:45
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:44:45
FARAH IBRAHIM  But I'm just wondering how this concept of adoption would fit in with your culture and your faith... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
ZYRA SAHID Hmm. 

00:44:55
FARAH IBRAHIM ...and, ah, given Hamid's family's val, family values, how would this work? Would it even be a possibility to consider? 

00:45:00
ZYRA SAHID I think that, that it could be... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
ZYRA SAHID ...because within, uhm, Islam, if, uhm, a couple adopts a child, then, uhm, they can earn a place in heaven. 

00:45:10
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
ZYRA SAHID So, so that would be, I mean, it could be a possibility but I'm not sure, uhm, how Hamid would, would feel about that possibility 'coz we haven't even talked about it. 

00:45:20
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, I understand that. I, I think that it would be really important to understand his point of view with him, to see how he views it. However, in that context, could you tell me a little bit about your cultural backgrounds? Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
ZYRA SAHID Sure, uhm, I am from Bangladesh... (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:45:35
ZYRA SAHID ...and Hamid is from Pakistan. 

00:45:40
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
ZYRA SAHID And we both grew up in our countries... (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
FARAH IBRAHIM Hmm. 

00:45:40
ZYRA SAHID ...until we came into the U.S. 

00:45:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. 

00:45:45
ZYRA SAHID And so, five years ago, when we were married, uhm, he came first, well, he was already here in the U.S. 

00:45:50
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. 

00:45:50
ZYRA SAHID And then, uhm, he came as a grad student, and then now, he is working for a high-tech firm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
ZYRA SAHID And, so then, later, I joined him. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
ZYRA SAHID And so, uhm, the way that we were married is ar, uhm, it was an arranged marriage. 

00:46:05
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
ZYRA SAHID And our family and friends thought that it would be a good match because of our same culture and religion and the values that we have. 

00:46:10
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
ZYRA SAHID  And, but, I've come to realize that we both see, uhm, Islam very, we have very different, uhm, perspectives. 

00:46:20
FARAH IBRAHIM Oh, you do? 

00:46:20
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
FARAH IBRAHIM Can you tell me a little bit about the differences, the cultural differences among you? 

00:46:25
ZYRA SAHID Uhm, yes, I think. Uhm, him, Hamid and his family are very conservative. 

00:46:30
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:30
ZYRA SAHID And where as, my family, they're not as conservative in the value education. 

00:46:35
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. 

00:46:35
ZYRA SAHID So, that is one reason why they thought it would be a good match. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
ZYRA SAHID Because, uhm, I had, uhm, stated that I want to pursue my education and a career. 

00:46:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:45
ZYRA SAHID And since, Hamid's family is not very conservative, you know, they don't agree with that and now, he's, now, my husband and he's saying that he wants me to have children first. (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
ZYRA SAHID And then later, uhm, go to school and get, get my education. 

00:47:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. So, essentially, you got married, or you accepted this match because this would get you closer to your goal of getting higher education in this country. But then after the marriage, you made a commitment to have children first because that's what Hamid's wish was. 

00:47:20
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
FARAH IBRAHIM And now, ah, all of a sudden, in the middle of all this planned life, you have this huge crisis where suddenly you put(ph) faced with the possibility of not being able to have any children. 

00:47:30
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
FARAH IBRAHIM And so, I can see why you're so upset and it had, it probably, has been a very difficult time for both of you. 

00:47:35
ZYRA SAHID Yeah. 

00:47:35
FARAH IBRAHIM  So. (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
ZYRA SAHID It has and, I just don't, I mean, like I, that would be an option for me, but I haven't talked about him with that yet. 

00:47:45
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
ZYRA SAHID So, I'm not sure, how uhm, I would, basically, I, now I want to see how I can tell him. (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
FARAH IBRAHIM  Oh, so you're worried... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
ZYRA SAHID So, we can talk... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
FARAH IBRAHIM ...about telling him too? 

00:47:55
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:47:55
FARAH IBRAHIM Well, I think that, uhm, given the, this situation, really, involves both of you. 

00:48:00
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:48:00
FARAH IBRAHIM And the decisions that you, you make, ah, should include him in the decision-making process because it's you're life, you know? 

00:48:10
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
FARAH IBRAHIM And anything that is decided now will affect the, the next thirty, forty years of your existence. So, what we need to do is, probably invite him to the counseling, and I'm sure that's going to be difficult. So, we need to probably think about, if you're comfortable. 

00:48:25
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
FARAH IBRAHIM Ah, I would like him to join us and, (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
ZYRA SAHID Oh, yeah. 

00:48:30
FARAH IBRAHIM ah, work on this issue but, uhm, we can examine together how to get him here if you are feeling uncomfortable about asking him. So what do you think about, ah, that. (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
ZYRA SAHID Uhm, I think I will feel comfortable in asking him. 

00:48:40
FARAH IBRAHIM You would? 

00:48:40
ZYRA SAHID  I think that, uhm, you know, I, I told him that I was considering coming to counseling and he seemed, he didn't let me know, either way, if he was against that... (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. 

00:48:50
ZYRA SAHID ...so, you know, that's something that I'm willing to do and try. 

00:48:55
FARAH IBRAHIM That's wonderful. I, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
FARAH IBRAHIM ...it would be great to have both of you here because this kind of a situation, specifically, is something that would lend itself well. Plus, I think that it's going to be a very devastating blow to him too. And, ah, if he is here with you, you can both work on re, resolution of the emotional loss, the grieving and, ah, the resolution of that issue and also about deciding how to proceed from here. 

00:49:20
ZYRA SAHID Okay. 

00:49:20
FARAH IBRAHIM Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
ZYRA SAHID  So, uhm, what I'll try to do then, is this week and... (crosstalk) 

00:49:25
FARAH IBRAHIM Okay. 

00:49:25
ZYRA SAHID ...talk to him about it and hopefully, we'll both be here next week with you. 

00:49:30
FARAH IBRAHIM Well, that'd be great. (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
FARAH IBRAHIM Yes. I look forward to having both of you. But before you go, I would like to give you an assignment. I would like you to talk to people from your culture and also look at the, you know, the faith, the religion, and look at what options exist and what are other peop, solutions that other people may have followed in similar situations. 

00:49:50
ZYRA SAHID Okay. 

00:49:50
FARAH IBRAHIM And so, that we will have some options to look at that are consistent with your cultural values when you come back. 

00:49:55
ZYRA SAHID Okay. It sounds good. 

00:49:55
FARAH IBRAHIM So, okay. Great. 

00:50:00
ZYRA SAHID Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
FARAH IBRAHIM All right. 

00:50:00
ZYRA SAHID Okay. 

00:50:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Thank you. 

00:50:00
ZYRA SAHID Thank you. 

00:50:00
FARAH IBRAHIM Yeah. 

00:50:00
