Developmental Counseling and Therapy Assessment & Adlerian Early Recollections Thomas J. Sweeney, Ph.D. & Jane E. Myers, Ph.D. Â©2004 

00:00:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Hello and welcome to this introduction to the use of Allen Ivey's Developmental Counseling and Therapy Assessment and Adlerian Early Recollections. DCT assessment is a systematic method for determining a clients capacity for knowing and experiencing life events in each of four cognitive developmental styles. Each developmental style is beneficial to understanding and successfully coping with life's tasks. Typically, a counselor knowledgeable in DCT can informally determine their client's preferred cognitive style from simply listening- 

00:00:50
Four DCT Developmental Cognitive Styles 

00:00:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY - to them, talk about their stories and problem issues. These styles are sensorimotor. This style involves being able to experience and describe one's feelings and emotions. 

00:01:00
Concrete Operational - relate "if this, then that" experiences 

00:01:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  The concrete operational style includes the ability to associate life experiences in a linear, specific manner. 

00:01:10
Formal Operational - understand behavioral patterns 

00:01:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  The formal operational style involves connecting life experiences into themes, rules, and associations that permit analysis, synthesis, and insight. For example, when consequences are the result of poor decision making. 

00:01:30
Dialectic - explore origins of one's "rules" and how they affect current life 

00:01:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  The dialectic style permits one to empathize, understand, and analyze different points of view, their origin and relative merits. All of these styles help us to live life successfully. When we have a block or incapacity to utilize one in more of these developmental cognitive styles, we experience distress. One goal in the DCT assessment is to identify coping strategies that clients use customarily and when blocked in achieving success, they help them learn to use their other cognitive capabilities to overcome the blocks. 

00:02:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY In the following session excerpts, I use an early recollection to begin the DCT assessment. Early recollections are specific life memories associated with childhood but remembered as vividly as though they were happening today. Alfred Adler noted that early memories are the repository that each of us draws upon to solve present life issues. As a result, they have direct implications whenever we find ourselves stuck, making poor choices and experiencing negative consequences. 

00:02:45
Adlerian Early Recollections: Clinical Considerations 

00:02:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY A few important points to consider when choosing to use early recollections include the following. Adlerians have been taught to seek experiences remembered before the age of eight. Adler believed that- 

00:02:55
Uncover lifestyle through ERs 

00:02:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  -one's lifestyle could be uncovered in part from an understanding of an individual's- 

00:03:00
Approach to life, self, & others 

00:03:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY - earliest recollections about life, self, and others. ERs provide one way of discovering- 

00:03:10
Attitudes & expectations for coping 

00:03:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY - attitudes, expectations, and approaches to coping with life. 

00:03:10
2. Specific memory event 

00:03:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  A common mistake beginners make when using ERs is to accept general, non-specific events as though they were ERs. Pictures or stories gotten from family members for example, are not sources of ERs. They must be events specific to a moment in time recalled as though it happened yesterday for them. It does not need to be dramatic or especially colorful to be useful. 

00:03:40
3. Describe in first person 

00:03:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  As with the DCT process, I asked clients to report the event as though it is happening now and with them reporting it in the first person. Phrases like- 

00:03:55
Encourage all senses 

00:03:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY - I saw, I heard, I felt will be the most common terms used. 

00:04:00
4. Preferably positive ERs initially 

00:04:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Early recollections are a repository of many emotions, attitudes, and expectations that go unexamined by most individuals. Responsible use of these methods and techniques require clinical skill and judgment. Having a strong relationship with the client, years of clinical experience, or a combination of both can moderate how soon and to what extent ERs with negative associations may be solicited. In general, however, we recommend that clients be encouraged to initially share positive recollections as an entree to the DCT process. 

00:04:40
5. Encourage detail without projection 

00:04:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Finally, the need for helping some clients to tell their stories and to relate to each of the cognitive styles is important. Doing so will require skill and not leading clients unduly. There are many common experiences among individuals in early childhood, even within the same family. The meaning they assign to such experiences can be very different. For example, as an oldest child or the youngest. We say, "Stay out of the client's way!" to call attention to active listening as the primary tools in the assessment process including soliciting ER details. 

00:05:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY In the following session, I am joined by a 32-year-old man who volunteered to participate in a DCT assessment using Early Recollections as a first step in the process. When asked if he had any specific life issues for which he was seeking resolution, he responded in the negative. Although, he acknowledged that family relationships are a high priority and he is seeking ways to balance family and other life demands. As you will note later, balance between family and other life demands is unique in its challenge for him. When asked about his earliest recollections, he quickly thought of two or three based on a Adlerian form that he'd filled up before the interview. After a short review of the content of the Early Recollections, I invited him to select one for further exploration. He chose one that involved seeing his dog run over by a car. Needless to say, this was a traumatic experience for him and some of you who view this video may identify with his emotional distress. I invite you to learn from this session how you too may benefit from understanding the implications of such early life experiences. Using the DCT questioning sequence, we begin the assessment process and I simply use basic responding microskills to help the client relive this experience. This process tends to result in an abreaction experience for the client, to which the interviewer must be keenly attuned. You will note that I deliberately used the first person to recount his description of the experience as a way of keeping the focus on his experience and not my interpretation of it. I'll make an effort to encourage and reflect what he is experiencing on all sensory levels, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and feeling. 

00:07:10
PRESTON  The one that, that, out of the ones that I gave you then, (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
PRESTON the one that I have the most vivid visceral response to, was the one when my dog was hit by a car. 

00:07:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Okay. 

00:07:25
PRESTON Uhm, the others I remember and recall, they're fine but that one I can remember it, I mean, that was a distinct feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
PRESTON ...that I could, that I can, you know. 

00:07:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Relate to? 

00:07:35
PRESTON  Relate to, yeah. 

00:07:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Well, let's go back to that day, that moment, (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY uhm, that time, and talk to me about, you can image it, what you see your, wherever you start, as though, or a motion picture of you, describe what you're seeing. 

00:07:55
PRESTON I've, what I recall is seeing my dog run down to the road and follow this cab. And as the, as, as it's running, he, he always would do this, it wasn't unusual for me to see that happen, uhm, and I don't, I'm not reacting to it. You know, I'm not, it's normal. 

00:08:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY I see my dog, he's running after a cab. He's running after other cars, I see him going, I'm not thinking anything in particular because he's chased other cars before. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
PRESTON  Right. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY So, I see my dog when, there's this pet was running after this cab. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
PRESTON Right, right, and then, you know, as I, I'm calling him to come back because my mom always used to call him to come back when he would do that, and I remember just, you know, hearing the tire hit him. There was a, there was a pop that happens whenever you know, the animal gets hit, I've heard it more times than I'd like to but, uhm, I ah, I remember hearing that and just seeing him rolling in the road. As they can, I, I, I almost, you know, I'm uhm, worrying that, I want the cab to stop, I want it, I want things to rewind back to where they were just before that. But anyhow, I, I, run down just as fast as I can and I scoop him up and I, uhm, we, we'd have running him back up to, uhm, to our house, we have a, ah, an embankment that is not terribly steep but for a child that's four years old, you know, it's a little more of a, uhm, a (inaudible ) than it would be for me now, ah, so. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Let me see if I can, hold for one second here now. Ah, I see Pepper(ph) out in the road, (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:09:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY chasing after the cab, ah, I call after him and what my mom does to come back. 

00:09:50
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And he keeps on running. 

00:09:55
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And in the midst of all of this, the cab wheel runs over him and I hear this popping sound. (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
PRESTON It was the passenger rear tire, that, that hit my dog, it was a little Chihuahua terrier dog, so it was a small dog... (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
PRESTON ...and, ah, then I see Pepper rolling. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Rolling in the, in the road? 

00:10:15
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:10:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And, and, and I, and I rush out to him... (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  and I scoop him up in my arms, and I'm just a little kid. 

00:10:20
PRESTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY A young kid, three or four years of age and I start running back toward the house and I have to run up this embankment to get back to the house... (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
PRESTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...which is, ah, no, no small job for me at this point. 

00:10:30
PRESTON Right, and so, and I'm running up, and as I'm running up, and I'm getting there and I'm just crying and looking down at my dog, uhm, yeah, it, its mouth was open, (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
PRESTON its mouth was open and, and I just, I can remember the detail of, of seeing, for example, how the ridges on the roof of his mouth were formed and you know, there's an, the dogs have a pigmentation. 

00:10:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:55
PRESTON And sometimes, there's a difference in pigmentation and I could see how that was and, and it was just, you know, it wasn't something that I would have ever normally seen because I'm a little, dogs playing with you and stuff, you're not gonna st, (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:11:10
PRESTON it's not going to stop long enough for you to see that, and so just, you know, Pepper being so still and obviously so different from the way he was just previous to that. It was very alarming to me and, and, you know, I was crying a whole lot and, and it was. (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY So, I'm running at the, I'm running at the embankment and I'm, and I'm looking at him... (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...and he's lifeless, (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY you see his mouth is open and I can see the, the pigment on the top of the roof of his mouth and ah, and the ridges and, this is not normal, I don't, you don't get to see this kind of thing... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
PRESTON Right. 

00:11:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...when, when your dog is alive and, and, and jumping around and playing with you and so forth. So you, you're, you're al, a kind of alarmed that this, this awareness that I have, that this is different, this is very different... (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
PRESTON Right. (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...than anything that I've experienced before. 

00:11:55
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  And. 

00:12:00
PRESTON And so, you know, I take him to mom, that's, that's, (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY I'm taking him to mom. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
PRESTON that's my answer to any problem at that point. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
PRESTON  And, and ah, you know, whether I hope for her to fix him or not, I'm sure I did, but, uhm, you know, I believe we took him to the vet, I, I'm not sure if we did or not I, it was, you know, just one of those things, the next thing I've, I truly recall is, is putting him in the shoe box and doing a burial at the back yard. 

00:12:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
PRESTON Uhm, that, that just, yeah, I do remember this, my mom said that she would take me to a toy store, you know, since I was such a good boy through all this. And we never got to get in the toy store. (laughs) But, but, but, ah. 

00:12:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY You will note that the client began to describe another recollection. This is not uncommon and in Adlerian interview, I would likely have encouraged further elaboration in order to help establish reliability and validity for the hunches I develop associated with his approach to basic life tasks. With the DCT approach however, I want to guide the client in a process of self construction of meaning, if at all possible. This is most likely to occur if we keep the focus on one specific incident and the emotional response to the image of that experience. This can have the advantage of clients discovering and taking responsibility for having preconscious personal rules. Rules that they've created about how they should handle life decisions. Often, these are rules developed in other stages of life that may no longer be relevant to present circumstances. Because the relieving of the experience is essential to the emotional connection to follow in the assessment, I deliberately repeat what I've heard. You may note, however, that even non-verbally, I'm emotionally beginning to share the experience as well. 

00:13:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  There were really two pieces to it that the first piece is, ah, the, I see my dog, and he's out in the road chasing a car, which he's done before, and I'm not thinking too much about it because I've seen him do this before and, and suddenly he's under the passenger's side wheel, and I hear this thump... (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...ah, nothing I've ever heard before.(crosstalk) 

00:14:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY It's a very different sound, and the dog is rolling, I see my dog rolling and ah, I rush out into the street because it was just laying in the street now, and I pick him up in my arms and I run as hard as I can, I really have to run hard because I have to run up this hill, this little embankment with my dog in my arms and I, I'm looking at him and his mouth is open, I can see the pigment, I can see his, the rigidness(ph), ridges at the top of his, roof of his mouth which is very unusual. I'm alarmed by this because I realized that he's, he's, there's something different. This is bad, this is very bad, and I'm running to my mom as I always do when situations come up there, strange like this and different like this. Uhm, I don't remember, my mom being there, I know that I was moving toward her and that's kind of where this one stops, and, and right at that point. Is that, does that sound about right? 

00:15:10
PRESTON That's right. 

00:15:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Uhm, So the feeling that you had at that moment was alarm. 

00:15:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uhm, I, I feel alarmed. I am, I'm holding my dog. 

00:15:20
PRESTON That's right. 

00:15:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  In the next segment, you will note that my summarization includes the emotional overtones described by the client, an essential component to the DCT process, involves helping clients to locate the feelings in their bodies that are associated with the described events. In this next segment, I asked the young man to identify these feelings in his body. Beginners in DCT often miss this step, and as a consequence, subsequent stages of the process are not as effective. 

00:15:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Where in your body are you feeling that alarm? 

00:15:55
PRESTON It's just, you know, the anxiety's running through my chest. It's, it's, about to burst type of, ah, feeling. Just, you know, I couldn't run fast enough, I couldn't be strong enough, it was just, you know, it was just, pick him up and go. And, and that the feeling goes through my whole body, but, you know, its centralized in my chest right there. 

00:16:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm, So, I'm running hard, ah, I'm alarmed and the alarm feels like, ah, it's just gonna cause my chest to explode. 

00:16:30
PRESTON Yeah, it wasn't a pressure in, it was more like ah, explosion out. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Coming out? Coming out? 

00:16:35
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:16:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  Okay, uhm, so, that's where that sensation, that's where that, that experience stops so to speak right there at that moment. You're running toward mom, not seeing her yet, but knowing that's where I'm going. 

00:16:55
PRESTON Yeah. And, and another sensory aspect of him, is just, you know like, from the beginning when, when I first realized something was wrong, also, just on the back of my neck, just the hair on the back of my neck just, really, you know, I didn't know, I wasn't old enough to understand the significance of that... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
PRESTON ...but I knew something was dead wrong. 

00:17:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Something really bad? 

00:17:20
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:17:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY You can now see the basic microcounseling techniques are central to staying out of the clients way while he's sharing his early recollection. The process however, is one of deliberately moving the client to use this experience to discover underlying assumptions that he's making in present day circumstances. To help make that possible, I asked him if he's ever had these sensory reactions again since his early recollection. He responds immediately in the affirmative, but this time, the crisis event involves his four-year-old son. Again, he describes the events in a linear, concrete fashion, but without a doubt, his sensory reactions are well represented in this life threatening situation. 

00:18:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Okay, have you ever had this feeling before? 

00:18:10
PRESTON Have I ever had it before? 

00:18:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Or, or since, rather. 

00:18:10
PRESTON  Since. 

00:18:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:18:15
PRESTON Yes, as a matter of fact, uhm, and I would say this was probably why that experience was one that showed up on my form(ph) and that's because, I, I had, had experience that very similar situation. I was playing with my son. I guess it's been, you know, this December of, not this past year but the year previous. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Yeah. 

00:18:40
PRESTON And he had a seizure while I was playing with him and I was home alone at the time and Nathan was a year-and-a-half-old at the time, ah, and to make the long story short, he went into this seizure and he wouldn't come out of it... (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
PRESTON  and. (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Let's back up for a moment. 

00:19:00
PRESTON Yes. 

00:19:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY You, you said, to make the long story short, let's see if we can test it, is it okay with you? 

00:19:05
PRESTON That's fine. 

00:19:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Are you sure? (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
PRESTON Yes. Yes. 

00:19:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Okay, so, ah, I, I'm seeing Nathan playing on the floor. 

00:19:10
PRESTON And up. He, he and I are playing on the bed. 

00:19:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Okay. 

00:19:15
PRESTON We're, we're, we're tickling, and we're, we're playing around and we have a ball... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
PRESTON ...uhm, a little beach ball-type ball. 

00:19:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
PRESTON That, that we play with and as I'm tickling him, he jumps up on, he's, you know, jumped up, but he kinda rolls over are on top of the ball and, and so his belly is on the ball, so I'm tickling him and he's bouncing up and down on the ball and he's laughing, and we're on the bed and so, then he got quiet and I turned him over and noticed that he didn't have, the look in his eyes were not, was not what I would, it wasn't right... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
PRESTON  and you know, I called his name and, and, and he didn't respond, and I you know, and I shook him a little bit and he just didn't think he'd, his limbs were, were limp. 

00:20:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY I can feel it. 

00:20:10
PRESTON Yeah. 

00:20:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY It's, so, we're on the bed, we're playing, we're having a good time. 

00:20:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY He's rolling on his belly on the, on this ball... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...and we've been laughing and having a good time, giggling and so forth and he, he's down and something is not right. 

00:20:25
PRESTON Correct. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY This is, this is different than anything before. 

00:20:30
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And I roll him over and I see that he doesn't look like he should look either. 

00:20:35
PRESTON Right. 

00:20:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY There's not the life there that I should see. 

00:20:35
PRESTON Right. 

00:20:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And? 

00:20:35
PRESTON  And I noticed he had a shortness of breath... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And? 

00:20:40
PRESTON ...that wasn't normal. We had no prior history of anything like this happening so, uhm, I gave it a second to see if, you know, this would pass and he would be alright. I didn't, I couldn't get a response and so I ran down with him to the car, I jumped in my car and I took him up near the emergency(ph) care center in a, you know, within a mile and a half or so of where I lived. So, I took him in there, I rushed him in there and they did even stopped me at the front desk, they said just get back and, until you, you know, call out the doctor's name and he'll come out in the hall. The doctor looks at Nathan and he says, "Son, there's nothing I can do for him. He's going to go to the hospital." And at that point, I didn't know what to do. Ah, I did, I knew what I had to do but I was just praying that I had ah, 15 minutes that it was gonna take for us to get to the hospital. And so, the, one of the ladies from the front desk offered to drive us to the hospital, so that I could hold him on my lap and, uhm, we drove to the hospital and took him to the emergency room. From there, ah, they were able to give him oxygen, they were able to give him what he needed to stabilize him from the point that he was at, but at that point we had no idea whether he was gonna make it or not make it, his mom had taken our niece to the doctor, ironically, just down the road, and I had to call her and, and eventually we were able to, you know, get together and she knew to get over to the hospital and it was just a very, there is no more anxiety producing situation in there. There's none, because we didn't know if he was gonna make it or not. And, uhm, they were able to stabilize him after a period of time and then, we went over to the children's hospital in Woodston(ph) where they, they intubated him and put him through a series of tests so we can find out what happened. 

00:22:35
THOMAS J. SWEENEY I moved the client through the DCT assessment questioning to establish his sensory motor event physically embedded and discernible to him. Next, I invite him to share another event, one that has happened since the first event. I seek to have him describe it in a linear, concrete manner, he's able to do so quite readily in both cases. At this point, we have two developmentally, very different places in life when these events took place. Some people might say that as an adult, the client will process these event's quite differently. They are correct to some degree as our client will attest. He will be missing an essential point however, if he does not see the connection between these events and their consequences for him. So I asked him, "What do these two events have in common?" In the formal operational processing, the client has an opportunity to begin discovering what it is he says to himself when faced with a life threatening event to his loved ones. He sums up his observations and I reflect what I think I'd heard him saying about them. 

00:23:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  So, what did these two situations have in common do you think? 

00:23:50
PRESTON Both situations were, they were, the, the, the subjects involved were very dear to my heart. I had an intimate relationship with both, (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
PRESTON ...ah, I love both, have fun with both. My world is a better place having those two subjects in my world and so to, all of a sudden, just on the spin of a dime have that reality altered in a significant way, in, in anxiety that goes along with that, uhm, first of all, encountering it but second of all, being aware that that can happen. 

00:24:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
PRESTON  Because sometimes we, I, before that would not have, have known intellectually sure that anything can happen at any time to anyone of our family members. Uhm, but there's a difference when you experience something... (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
PRESTON  and truly have to live out consequences, than there is, just thinking about it. And, and even though I wouldn't have spoken of it in that way as a four or five-year-old, you know, ignorance is bliss. 

00:25:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
PRESTON Before Pepper got hit by that car, I never worried about whether my dog ran in the road, I never worried about anything, all of a sudden, then I saw the destructive power that came, that, that's, it's right there, then all of a sudden came and changed things and then... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
PRESTON ...you know, that has an impact on you or at least it had an impact on me... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
PRESTON ...to one way or another. 

00:25:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  So, what these two have in common is the fact that ah, you, you had, uhm, companionship, ah, friendship, ah, not, no, no, love in both situations, ah, were very dear to you, both your dog, your child infinitely so more of course. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
PRESTON Absolutely. 

00:25:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uhm, the, uhm, shock... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  of the suddenness of this change and what was joy to, and, and really kind of nonchalantness... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...in terms of how you're feeling life to the realization that it can all be changed in an instant with just ah, no forewarning, no, no reason to expect it at all. 

00:26:05
PRESTON Right. 

00:26:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  And the alarm that that brings, uhm, the physiological reaction is one of do whatever you have to do as quickly as you can do it and find someone who can help make it right. And as you said, and the one you'd like to have spun that back so that the car was in a different place, and another case I guess it would be, ah, this couldn't be happening, you know, just can't be happening. And ah. 

00:26:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  So far, the client has been able to process his chosen life events in sensory, concrete and formal operational modes. As a professional counselor, I'm beginning to use more advanced techniques to gently, but purposely begin moving him toward the question of readiness for change. As we proceed to the next segment, we're approaching a critical phase in the assessment. We summarize what has been learned. One of the outcomes is the realization that he believes that he must be continually vigilant. One important consequence of continued vigilance is a high level of energy being devoted to this expectation. He's able to acknowledge that the price he pays for his vigilance is demanding. 

00:27:15
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Let, let me pause for a moment there. (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
PRESTON Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY I'm, I'm feeling again that as you start to talk about the pneumonia and going into the hospital. The chest is starting to fill up again. (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
PRESTON Oh yeah. 

00:27:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And the neck is starting to get stiff again. I'm beginning to feel that sensation coming over again and it's as though, uhm, it's as though something is starting again where you, it's almost like being at the starting line waiting for the gun to go off and you don't know when it's gonna go off. 

00:27:40
PRESTON  Right. 

00:27:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And you know that if it goes off, you've got to be ready to go right now. 

00:27:45
PRESTON Right. 

00:27:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY And, uhm, that brings with it a price. 

00:27:50
PRESTON Yes. 

00:27:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY  And what is that? 

00:27:55
PRESTON Well, it's if, if that is the way that I choose to live my life, it's gonna be a very exhausting life. Because when you're constantly on guard, you're constantly, you know, it's vigilant in that way. The price is, it takes an extreme amount of energy and focus to do that and, and living day to day, that's a tough thing to maintain. 

00:28:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
PRESTON And so, when, when I was making the point that I was making earlier that I'd recognized I've been through a tough situation and that I made the right decisions, when the night, right decisions needed to be made. That realization which was coming as we were talking is one of those things that, its a, in the mental tape that I'm gonna put back in my head to say when this stuff starts coming off, if it happens, you have confidence that you've done the right thing before and you'll do the right thing again. 

00:28:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
PRESTON You don't have to live your life constantly on guard in that fashion, you know, you can relax and you're gonna be fine but if it jumps out, you'll be ready to go. 

00:29:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
PRESTON Trust in yourself with that much... (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
PRESTON ...and, ah, for me, right now, the toughest thing is just, you know, I love him so much and that hurt that his mom and I felt during that period of time was so great that it takes time to just, you know, move that through my system... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
PRESTON ...and that's what I'm doing right now because I know, I mean, it, it does not take much to trigger those types, that emotional reaction in me. It doesn't even have to be a hospital visit per se, it could just be, you know, something out there, then I'll recognize it. Now, that's a challenge for me at this point in time. 

00:29:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
PRESTON Uhm, and by talking about it and by doing processing as we're doing right now, it helps, you know, just to be more aware of, of what's going on and how it's affected me. 

00:30:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Yeah, 'coz you're saying, ah, I'm saying that I know that, ah, in a crisis I'm gonna triage, I'm gonna do what needs to be done and I will be ready. I also know that it can happen at any moment and I don't know when that moment is and it keeps me on my guard and it may be the slightest thing that Nathan does or doesn't do, ah, it triggers it. Uhm, and it may even be, in relation to your wife or your mother whatever, it can be triggered again. Uhm, so on one hand, I know that I can, I can problem solve, I can do what needs to be done, I've been depended upon and I've come through okay. It's the sense of waiting for when it's going to happen again because it seems like things happen in life, uhm, and what I'm working on now is being able to, uhm, give myself messages that lower the bar so that I'm not waiting like the gun's in the air... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...you know, like it's there all the time. But it's, ah, it does take a lot of energy, (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
PRESTON Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
THOMAS J. SWEENEY ...it takes a lot of energy. It's, in those moments when it happens, uhm, where it pops into the chest and goes up the neck, ah, it's like starting to relive again if, without even that event happening. 

00:31:20
PRESTON True. 

00:31:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY You're starting to relive it again, and so, uhm, I imagine even, ah, your studies contribute to your trying to find ways to, you know, relaxation, stress management type of techniques. 

00:31:30
PRESTON  Well, that(ph) if, if, you were to ask me point blank, Preston where are you in terms of your personal development, what do you see as the next phase for you, and that was the way we started out our conversation. 

00:31:45
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:31:45
PRESTON That's pretty much where I would've picked up and what I would have said was, I've learned some of the stuff over the past year or so. Uhm, right now I'm in a point where I'm deciding, is that what I want to do? Because for me, at this point in my life, the tough decision is do I wannna put down this vigilance? Do, I mean, if I want to relax the vigilance and the only way, you know, it's not something that makes itself apparent all the time but, the only way that I could consistently say that I'm putting the vigilance at bay is, is through behaviors that I choose to, to take and I don't want. Do I choose to, uhm, allow myself to relax, or do I choose to allow myself to, my mind to pursue a different type of thought process, this triage as you mentioned earlier has its own pattern of thought. 

00:32:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
PRESTON You're constantly assimilating, prioritizing, what's the most critical second, what's critical and how am I gonna react to it, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
PRESTON ...and I'm not gonna react to it. And, and you don't have to have a crisis to still be thinking that way. 

00:33:00
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:00
PRESTON  Uhm, relaxed thought is a very different experience altogether and there is no prioritizing. It's, it's simply allow. (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Taking life as it comes. 

00:33:15
PRESTON Right. 

00:33:15
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
PRESTON And, and at this point where my struggle is, is to allow the vigilance to just take a rest and, and the ways that I have to do that, I know of some ways but at this point, I'm struggling when committing to those ways. That's, that's my biggest, and I know that I will perform at a higher level when I make that change, but I haven't chosen to make that change yet. I haven't felt ready to deal with that change yet and I don't, I've gotten closer, but I'm not, (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
PRESTON and I really, I hoped(ph) yet. 

00:33:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY The dialectic phase of questioning is intended to invite the clients to examine their life rules and expectations from the perspective of others. We speak of deconstructing the client rules in terms of their price to the clients as well as others with whom they live and work. When the price is greater than the client is willing to pay, there's a greater readiness for change. This can be change in what they say to themselves as well as change in how they cope with their daily expectations for life. In the final segment of this interview, the client responds to an invitation to examine how his vigilance and the energy it requires affects his family. For the first time in this interview, he acknowledges a block in his capacity to experience and process events. For some clients, the block happens at the sensorimotor, concrete, or formal operational phases. This is an articulate, well-educated client. He knows what he's ready to do and what he's not. 

00:34:55
PRESTON I don't to be honest with you, I don't live in the way I see that how our family interacts. I don't know if my change would affect them in a dramatic way. I think I know enough about systems to know that it worked, (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
PRESTON ...but I really don't think of this, at this point in time in that way because it's still more about me right now than it is about them. 

00:35:20
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Right. 

00:35:20
PRESTON I understand it will actually, the differences of what we're talking about. 

00:35:25
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
PRESTON But, in terms of where I am, and focusing on this problem, I'm still focused only what I need to do rather than how it's gonna affect them. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Affect them, what they went through, I guess. 

00:35:35
PRESTON That's so, because that, they are gonna be able to motivate me at this point. Well, how it affects them is not a motivating factor for me. It's how it affects me. 

00:35:40
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
PRESTON At what side, and the fact that, that my change begins to permeate my relationships then that, that other aspect on that can become a negative part of what's going on before me. 

00:35:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
THOMAS J. SWEENEY So what have we learned through this DCT Assessment and Early Recollections, first, that specific early life experiences are related to present client issues, attitudes, and methods of coping. Second, that the DCT assessment process provides a template that beginner or expert can follow in order to learn clients preferred cognitive developmental styles and processing life events. Third, we can use these relatively simple but very powerful techniques to more efficiently and effectively help clients identify both developmental blocks and preferred coping strategies. While the young man in this interview was not seeking change at this time, I'm confident that his level of readiness has been raised. As is true on a daily basis, clients rarely move from insight to change without starts and stops, often it's what the client does between sessions with such understanding that is most important to future counseling sessions. After a DCT Assessment, any number of approaches and techniques can be used to both match and mismatch client's developmental styles in order to help them be on their blocks. With experience and proper supervision, both Early Recollections and The DCT assessment and intervention strategies, will prove powerful methods for any practitioner.
