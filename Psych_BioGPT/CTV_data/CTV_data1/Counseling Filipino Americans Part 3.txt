KEVIN NADAL , Ph.D. Assistant Professor and Author of Filipino American Psychology Hi, my name is Dr. Kevin Nadal, I am a professor of psychology at John Jay College for Criminal Justice, it’s an university of New York. You are about to watch (inaudible ) the counseling session between me and a young male client. Um… my client here today is a Biracial Dominican and Filipino American who grew up here in the United States. Um… we’re going to talk about few things including family issues as well as the complexities about growing up on as both Dominican and Filipino. Um… pay attention to some of the, the ways that we’re able to talk about um… his feelings and may be how we might try to focus in on feelings because it might be difficult for him to do so. Um… also um… listen to how we start off with may be talking about more abstract ideas um… him not necessarily having a presenting problem, I mean how eventually it leads into us discovering a lot more um… than, than we had expect it. And finally pay attention to some of the techniques that I might use with this client. For example, often time to some point to check in with your client throughout the session um… just to see how they are feeling and may be to see if he need to make any adjustments in order to better decision. So I hope you'll enjoy the video.

00:04:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:04:30
CARLOS So we were always pretty much in close contact with my father side of the family, we’ve only gone to the Philippines a visit my mother side of the family… 

00:04:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:40
CARLOS …twice, once when I was in first grade… 

00:04:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:04:45
CARLOS …and the second time two years ago ah… during the winter. 

00:04:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:50
CARLOS So we I mean it’s not that we… we’re specially distant but it was just geographically we are so far apart from each other that… 

00:04:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:04:55
CARLOS …we didn’t get to interact the way that we got to interact with my father side of family. 

00:05:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:05:05
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:05:05
KEVIN NADAL So how do you think that affected um… your family in general? 

00:05:10
CARLOS Well I guess for me ah… growing up I’ve… I just didn’t… (inaudible )… 

00:05:18
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:20
CARLOS I guess Dominican and Filipino… 

00:05:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:20
CARLOS …because growing up where I did in New Jersey… 

00:05:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:25
CARLOS …I just didn’t really meet that many ah… I didn’t really meet that many Filipino children um… actually I didn’t really even meet that many Dominican Children either. 

00:05:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:35
CARLOS So it was kind of a binary… 

00:05:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:40
CARLOS …being like other white or black. 

00:05:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:05:45
CARLOS Um… then growing up I… we started there is more of a movement of like other ah… cultures and races… 

00:05:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:50
CARLOS …and ethnicities… 

00:05:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:55
CARLOS …into the city where we lived, but it was I don’t know it was weird because you never really knew where you fit… 

00:06:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:06:00
CARLOS …other people didn’t know where you fit… 

00:06:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:05
CARLOS …and you know sometimes you could play the chord of oh… I’ll fit in with this group today… 

00:06:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:10
CARLOS …I’ll fit in with that group tomorrow. 

00:06:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:10
CARLOS And then sometimes just… you know you don’t, you feel like you don’t fit in anywhere… 

00:06:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah, and what does that feel like um… once you just feel like you don’t fit in anywhere? 

00:06:20
CARLOS Well just to not feel like you said… and you, you definitely feel like an outsider you feel (inaudible )… 

00:06:27
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:06:27
CARLOS …sometimes um… it’s frustrating because you don’t really know who… who you can speak to… 

00:06:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:06:35
CARLOS …even, even with my parents. 

00:06:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:35
CARLOS It’s difficult because my, my dad is Dominican, my mom is Filipino… 

00:06:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:06:40
CARLOS …so they don’t really know what it’s like being both… 

00:06:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:06:45
CARLOS …and it’s just hard to relate to lot of other, other friends… 

00:06:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:50
CARLOS …because sometimes they you know a lot of times they’re not of two different ah… racial… 

00:06:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:00
CARLOS …background, and even if they are you know it’s still very personal, very individualized… 

00:07:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, right. 

00:07:05
CARLOS …experience (inaudible ). 

00:07:06
DR. KEVIN NADAL You make experience no matter what… 

00:07:06
CARLOS Yeah so I guess it’s frustrating… 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:07:10
CARLOS …ah… predominantly. 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, and are you able to, to talk about these things with may be your siblings at all? 

00:07:15
CARLOS Um… I actually don’t because the way that I like the way that I kind of cope with these feelings. 

00:07:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:25
CARLOS I usually just ah… bottled it up… 

00:07:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:30
CARLOS …I just kept it with myself I didn’t really try to express a lot… 

00:07:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:07:35
CARLOS …ah… growing up or even now, now I don’t feel like I am so frustrated… 

00:07:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:40
CARLOS But I guess in the past when I was feeling more frustrated I just didn’t. 

00:07:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:50
CARLOS And I don’t know, we never really, I never really spoke to my brother or sister about these types of issues. 

00:07:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure… sure… so Carlos I am hearing a lot of different things I am hearing you talk about um… being both Dominican and Filipino and some of the struggles that you might have with that um… particularly um… the, the fact that you grew up and, and neighborhood that may be they want just many too many kinds of Filipino’s. I mean that I am also hearing this idea that um… your… you don’t get an opportunity to really talk about these issues um… and I am wondering you know what’s that like talking about these issues with me right now. 

00:08:20
CARLOS I actually went to a counselor there was a period of time… 

00:08:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:25
CARLOS …when my entire family went to counseling… 

00:08:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:30
CARLOS Um… but this was actually not from (inaudible ) we brought up so… 

00:08:36
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:08:36
CARLOS …I feel like it is pretty therapy and just be odd to talk about it. 

00:08:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure… sure… yeah, and you… you talked about you know your, your family dynamics that’s what brought you in here today and, and um… let’s talk about that is there other certain stresses that you’re experiencing as being a part of your family? 

00:08:50
CARLOS There are actually ah… as the youngest child of the family, I was always really the baby so… 

00:09:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:00
CARLOS …I, I don't know my mother and I had a pretty close relationship and it’s… 

00:09:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:05
CARLOS …it’s been close throughout the years… 

00:09:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:05
CARLOS …my father and I on the other hand we haven’t really had that closeness and actually, recently, we… I feel like it’s been kind a deteriorating… 

00:09:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:20
CARLOS …I know that my parents love me and I do love them but… 

00:09:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:20
CARLOS …I feel like my dad and I especially as a boy we just like, we clash and we fight over like petty things I, I suppose. 

00:09:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:09:30
CARLOS Um… 

00:09:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL And what’s that like to, to have that relationship with him right now? 

00:09:35
CARLOS That’s very frustrating, that… 

00:09:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:35
CARLOS Yeah, yeah getting so angry like… 

00:09:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:40
CARLOS …it’s he’ll… you know he’ll come home with… whatever stresses that he has had during the day… 

00:09:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:09:50
CARLOS …and then I meet… meet him with mine and then we just clash immediately… 

00:09:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:09:50
CARLOS …I don’t, I don’t really understand why… 

00:09:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure… 

00:09:55
CARLOS …I haven’t asked him and I… I just feel like… 

00:10:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right… 

00:10:00
CARLOS I feel like sometimes we’re just beyond that point like even just talk to him about stuff like that. 

00:10:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:05
CARLOS My mom has definitely… I’ve spoken to my mom about this… 

00:10:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:10
CARLOS …and she is encouraging me to speak to my dad, but I don’t know sometimes I just get so, I feel like… 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:15
CARLOS That’s… it's just kind of impossible… 

00:10:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:20
CARLOS So I just not really tried. 

00:10:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean like you know, I just wanted to… to… to acknowledge like you know, I am glad that you are able to talk about this and at the same time you know, you're talking about how you feel angry towards him than you're smiling… 

00:10:30
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:10:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL …so, tell me about what, what, what do you make about? 

00:10:35
CARLOS Its, it's you know it's angry, and I, I am… I guess I'm smiling, because I know its foolish that I love him and… 

00:10:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:10:40
CARLOS …he loves me, but it's just, I guess very absurd… 

00:10:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:45
CARLOS …like be like… that we can be so angered in each other over nothing… 

00:10:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL I see. 

00:10:50
CARLOS …over like little things… 

00:10:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:50
CARLOS …and its you know then will hang out the next day or later even later another day, we'll be having dinner and he'll be telling store about when he was younger, in, in the Dominican Republic… 

00:11:00
DR KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:11:00
CARLOS …and this is like a really funny story and he is like, he is a really fun guy… 

00:11:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:05
CARLOS …lot of my friends like him as a father, he is really great father figure… 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:10
CARLOS …but I don’t know between him and I, like it’s just not, we don’t have that connection… 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:11:20
CARLOS …sometimes or… 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:11:20
CARLOS …even a lot of times… 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:11:20
CARLOS …we don’t have a connection… 

00:11:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, um… so you know you were talking a little bit about your, your relationship with your father and I can’t help it wonder if, if you think that there are any um… cultural things that are going on, especially with the ways that um… may be you both been taught to be as men… 

00:11:40
CARLOS Okay, I… 

00:11:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL …men in both Dominican culture as well as men in… as the man who is both Dominican and both you know. 

00:11:45
CARLOS Yeah, you know I definitely think um… our background because… and… our background within our culture is… 

00:11:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:50
CARLOS …has definitely changed ah… between even generations then… 

00:11:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:11:55
CARLOS …like so many different factors you know, my father growing up in the Dominican Republic … 

00:12:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:12:00
CARLOS …he, he lived there until he was about 6 or 7… 

00:12:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:12:05
CARLOS …and you know, oh… well, he would go around you know and just fool around to be you know crazy little boy, and then the rest of his childhood, he was actually growing up in New York city… 

00:12:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:20
CARLOS …in Manhattan and he learnt the way that he grew up in a Metropolitan City like New York … 

00:12:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
CARLOS …is definitely different from the way that I grew up in a, a very small city… 

00:12:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:12:35
CARLOS New Jersey. 

00:12:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:35
CARLOS …ah… we didn’t, we weren’t faced with the same type of issues, and it's just, it's difficult for both of us to relate to one another… 

00:12:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL I see… 

00:12:45
CARLOS …so, in times of I can give you example… 

00:12:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:50
CARLOS …sometimes we'll be fighting and he… he wants to get his point across, so… 

00:12:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:55
CARLOS …he will raise his voice louder and louder… 

00:12:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:55
CARLOS …and its, it's just like dad you know I still hear you… 

00:13:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:00
CARLOS …but I don’t hear the messages that you're giving me its just… 

00:13:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:13:05
CARLOS …getting louder, and eventually at times I just learnt… at times I will just like kind of… 

00:13:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:10
CARLOS …back down, be very passive… 

00:13:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:15
CARLOS …and very like even submissive, because growing up I learned that, I actually learned from my brother and sister being examples when they begin fight with my parents. 

00:13:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:13:25
CARLOS …ah… so as about (inaudible ) I would see them going to fight, and I would think myself Oh, well you know, things would be a bit easier between my parents and myself… 

00:13:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:35
CARLOS …I just do what they say you know if I just… 

00:13:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:35
CARLOS …try to make them happy… 

00:13:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:40
CARLOS …and just do whatever, whatever, whatever it is… 

00:13:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:40
CARLOS …that they want me to don’t really speak up back to them… 

00:13:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right… 

00:13:45
CARLOS …or against them, so I kind a just internalize that… 

00:13:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:50
CARLOS …since, since at very young, young age… 

00:13:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:55
CARLOS …and I still do that now, and its difficult for me to… 

00:13:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:14:00
CARLOS …meet my father in the way that ah… 

00:14:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:00
CARLOS …he approaches me… 

00:14:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL So, and what so like it meaning to that this idea of it's easier to just go along with what they say. 

00:14:10
CARLOS It's you know growing up I thought oh this is great idea, you know I am not, I am never getting to fight with my parents… 

00:14:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:15
CARLOS …but after you know, once becoming an adolescent and then to the years is just getting to a point where you want to say something and you finally build up the courage to do so… 

00:14:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:30
CARLOS …and my parents they don’t understand it… 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:14:30
CARLOS …they don’t, they don't see me as their child or… 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:35
CARLOS …don’t see me as their child or that person who can like… 

00:14:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:35
CARLOS …say these things to them. 

00:14:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:40
CARLOS …um… so they just get very… they in-turn get angry with me… 

00:14:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right… 

00:14:45
CARLOS …or frustrated with me… they'd say Carlos what happened to you… 

00:14:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:45
CARLOS …you used to be such a good boy. 

00:14:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:14:45
CARLOS ..now you just, now you just adjured, now you just like trying to pick, pick a fight with everybody and you know, it's, it's difficult to make them understand, or to realize that, it's not, that I am trying to pick a fight with everybody, it's this one incident right now… 

00:15:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:05
CARLOS …that I have a problem with and I am trying to bring it to your attention and… 

00:15:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right… 

00:15:10
CARLOS …and you don’t see it in a way that I see it… 

00:15:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:15:10
CARLOS I guess, that's a lot of frustration… 

00:15:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. 

00:15:15
CARLOS …going on between everybody… 

00:15:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:15
CARLOS Um… 

00:15:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL I mean it sounds like you're struggling to be hurt in a loved place. 

00:15:20
CARLOS Yes, yes. 

00:15:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:20
CARLOS That's exactly and it's, it's really… 

00:15:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:15:25
CARLOS …difficult to find a new ways communicate to each other and just be able to reinforce these new methods to… of communication… 

00:15:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:35
CARLOS So I don’t know, it's sometimes you just feel really confused, as to what to do… 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure… 

00:15:40
CARLOS …and, and to how to speak to one another… 

00:15:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, yeah, I mean that sounds like even may be your parents coming from a different generation um… that there might be, that sort of conflict, because they have a certain expectation of how you should communicate with them… 

00:15:55
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:15:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL …and you are just trying to be hurt and you are struggling to be hurt. 

00:15:55
CARLOS I think, rather actually think, you bring up a good point because my brother and sister like I said, they would… they would get into arguments with my parents or they begin to fight or whatever. 

00:16:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:16:05
CARLOS Since they have been younger, since they were younger, so when they do it now a days… 

00:16:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:10
CARLOS …my parents still didn’t know they get… partly get upset… 

00:16:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:15
CARLOS …but it's not to the degree that happens with me, because these… I may be… they still see me as their's little boy… 

00:16:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:16:20
CARLOS …who just wants to go along with whatever they say… 

00:16:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right… 

00:16:25
CARLOS …and may be they even in me may be they see themselves like as little… as younger children that’s what they did to their parents… 

00:16:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:35
CARLOS …so I don’t know some sort of this thing, I don’t know I think, that’s myself… 

00:16:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL So… 

00:16:35
CARLOS …I have no idea what to make up with… 

00:16:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah, um… what’s up like talking about all these issues with me right now? 

00:16:45
CARLOS Ah… actually I like it a lot, because I like having that third party… 

00:16:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:50
CARLOS …who is really in the sense detached from the situation… 

00:16:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm… 

00:16:55
CARLOS …and being able look at it through, I guess, objective type of lens… 

00:17:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:00
CARLOS So I feel it’s good being able to just say these things… 

00:17:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:05
CARLOS …from my side. 

00:17:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:17:05
CARLOS I'm sure like if my parents hear it, they’ll probably say something from their side too, but… 

00:17:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… Hmm… 

00:17:10
CARLOS Umm… I feel like you being… 

00:17:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:15
CARLOS …a professor of psychology also… 

00:17:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… Hmm… 

00:17:15
CARLOS …I feel like you’d have a better idea of… 

00:17:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:20
CARLOS …what to make all these things that I’ll tell you… 

00:17:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm… Hmm… 

00:17:20
CARLOS …then for me to just keep thinking about them and have them ruminating throughout my mind. 

00:17:25
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Sure, sure, sure. I mean you know one thing that you had mentioned before was just this umm… conflict of… of being both Dominican and Filipino and… and sometimes not having anyone to talk to because maybe they wouldn’t understand… 

00:17:40
CARLOS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:17:40
KEVIN NADAL Umm… your experience and I guess one thing that I just wanted to… to explore with you, just what it’s like talking about it with me? So someone who you know is umm… full Filipino and… and maybe you know you have other friends they are either full Dominican or Latino of full Filipino or Asian or whatever that might be. Umm… what’s that like sharing some of these things with me when it’s hard to for you to do with other folks? 

00:18:00
CARLOS It’s again… well, it’s again just not the fact that umm… 

00:18:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:05
CARLOS …you’re Filipino… 

00:18:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:10
CARLOS …it’s, I think it’s the fact that you’re a professor… 

00:18:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:10
CARLOS …of psychology, so I just feel a bit more open, but… 

00:18:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:15
CARLOS …just in normal everyday times, speaking to other people about this, it’s… it’s more of a like a lument(ph)… 

00:18:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:25
CARLOS …to them, it’s like oh you know I don’t know what it’s like being fully Filipino… 

00:18:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:18:30
CARLOS …or I don’t know what it’s like being fully Dominican… 

00:18:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:30
CARLOS …and even they will say back to me, I don’t know what… like what it’s like being both. 

00:18:35
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:18:35
CARLOS And usually they ask me oh you know Carlos how do you say this is Spanish or how do you say this isn’t (inaudible ) and I’m like… 

00:18:43
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:43
CARLOS …I have no idea. I don’t speak either. 

00:18:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:18:45
CARLOS And it’s… I don’t know. It’s… that was confusing. 

00:18:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:50
CARLOS So being able to say like speak about this with you, it’s been… 

00:18:50
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:18:55
CARLOS …I don’t know, maybe I have already like internalized it before… 

00:18:55
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:18:55
CARLOS …that I don’t really think about it too much now… 

00:19:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Yeah. 

00:19:00
CARLOS Umm… I know it’s like… it’s just a part of me and I just… 

00:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:19:05
CARLOS I guess I can just go off(ph) over it. 

00:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:19:05
CARLOS So… 

00:19:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, maybe that’s something for you to think about is… is what are you doing with these emotions, you know because it sounds like umm… you know these were sources of conflict or confusion for you as a child and now maybe you don’t think about these things at all. So, umm… you know what do you do with that? 

00:19:25
CARLOS Again how to say is that I just really just put up to the back burner… 

00:19:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:30
CARLOS and maybe I could assure thing of… 

00:19:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:30
CARLOS …everyone’s in a while. 

00:19:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. So, you know we are talking about your relationship with umm… your family and we talked about your father. What about your relationship with your mother? What's that like? 

00:19:45
CARLOS Ah… my relationship with my mother is still pretty strong. 

00:19:50
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:50
CARLOS Umm… even now, well sometimes she’ll you know be a bit more frustrated with me. We might get some arguments now and then… 

00:19:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:00
CARLOS …not to the degree that my father and I get the fights or arguments, but… 

00:20:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:00
CARLOS …I think my mom’s frustration with me might stem from me, I don’t know being the… not being the youngest and having to leave the nest in that sense… 

00:20:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:10
CARLOS …being the baby… 

00:20:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:20:15
CARLOS …who has grown up now… 

00:20:15
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:15
CARLOS …so I feel… also along with that, I feel like I’ve always kind of leaned a bit more to my Filipino heritage. 

00:20:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:30
CARLOS Umm… and I… I don’t know why that is, but… 

00:20:30
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:20:30
CARLOS …I feel like I’ve always… maybe it was because of my mom because I’ve always had a really strong connection with her. 

00:20:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:40
CARLOS So we’ve had good… we… we have a good relationship. 

00:20:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:45
CARLOS And I don’t know… I don’t know… 

00:20:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:20:45
CARLOS I just… I don’t really know what to say about that. 

00:20:50
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. And it’s interesting though that you said that maybe you… you lean towards your Filipino heritage because you know you said that you don’t… you didn’t get the (inaudible ) Filipino family growing up as much. 

00:21:00
CARLOS Maybe. 

00:21:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. That’s what is something just… 

00:21:00
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:21:00
KEVIN NADAL …just to wonder about. Umm… you know as you talk about some of these things you know one thing that I’m concisely hearing is the idea of your parents seeing you as the baby and you know not accepting like you are growing up or not hearing your voice. Umm… and I guess I wonder you know what that feels like the fact that perhaps you feel like a baby or a child in their eyes? 

00:21:25
CARLOS I guess, sometimes, I I still like… you know… 

00:21:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:30
CARLOS …I still like being ah… nurtured in this type of way, but I look at my other friends, I look at… 

00:21:40
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:40
CARLOS …not so much my brother and sister, I… we’re all pretty nurtured very heavily. 

00:21:45
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:45
CARLOS But I look at a lot of my other friends and they’ve been able to kind of cut the core. They’ve been able to… 

00:21:50
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:21:55
CARLOS …grow up and move on to the next stage in their life. 

00:21:55
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:00
CARLOS And that I look at myself and like oh, jeez, I feel not so much ashamed… 

00:22:00
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:22:05
CARLOS …or disappointed, but somewhere along those lines like… 

00:22:05
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:22:05
CARLOS …why can’t I grow up of like… 

00:22:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:10
CARLOS …I just… I don’t know it’s… I’ve graduated college… 

00:22:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:15
CARLOS …and I’m about to start working and I just need to… 

00:22:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:22:20
CARLOS …be there mentally and like physically. I need to… I need to have what it takes to you know make it on my own. 

00:22:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:30
CARLOS So… and my parents still see me as a child, as a… 

00:22:30
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:22:30
CARLOS …as a baby. I don’t know that’s… I feel like that pulls me back sometimes. 

00:22:35
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. Umm… so, you know what’s that like this idea that you know you want to be able to start work and to be cheated as an adult and… and now, you know your parents are still holding on to you being this baby or this child. 

00:22:50
CARLOS Umm… it is actually… actually, I might have… I just wanna clarify things a little bit. 

00:23:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay, sure. 

00:23:00
CARLOS It’s… I feel like it’s more of my mom who kind of olds me back, yeah… 

00:23:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, mom, okay, Uh…Huh… 

00:23:05
CARLOS …and maybe it is because that strong relationship that we have. 

00:23:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:23:05
CARLOS She always wants to be there. She is very supportive. 

00:23:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:10
CARLOS You know I do appreciate that, but sometimes I just feel like it’s a bit too much or… 

00:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:23:15
CARLOS …maybe she is just like bringing in another elements to that… 

00:23:15
KEVIN NADAL Great(ph). 

00:23:15
CARLOS …or it was my father , he kind of… I guess he expects me to know certain things. 

00:23:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:25
CARLOS …and umm… he’s like, oh, come on, I knew this when I was… 

00:23:25
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:23:25
CARLOS …he kind of compares us. 

00:23:25
KEVIN NADAL Umm… Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:30
CARLOS He compares himself when he was this age to me when I’m at this age now… 

00:23:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:23:35
CARLOS …and it’s like dad you know I feel like it’s just been so different between your generation… 

00:23:40
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:40
CARLOS …when you were that young and me now umm… so, my dad, my mom kind of… I feel like my mom kind to holds me back, whereas my dad doesn’t push me forward either… 

00:23:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:55
CARLOS …he just kind of you know compares between… 

00:24:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:24:00
CARLOS …like the two parallels. 

00:24:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:24:00
CARLOS And I just feel that’s stagnant… 

00:24:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. 

00:24:05
CARLOS …stagnant right there and it’s… I don’t know it’s a little… 

00:24:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. I mean that sounds like a… a conflict that you know they are pulling you in different directions… 

00:24:10
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:24:10
KEVIN NADAL …you know your mom wants you to stay straightaway, your dad might be doing some comparative… 

00:24:15
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:24:15
KEVIN NADAL …Umm… or comparing with you… 

00:24:20
CARLOS And I guess the thing is neither of them really push me in the way that I want… I want to be pushed. 

00:24:25
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:24:25
CARLOS And I haven’t really expressed that or told them… 

00:24:25
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:24:25
CARLOS …what I needed. So they don’t know and… and I’m not telling them… 

00:24:30
KEVIN NADAL Right. Right. 

00:24:30
CARLOS …and this is not getting anything done. 

00:24:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. And it sounds like you wanna tell them that maybe it’s difficult to do so or it’s hard to find that way or you could do it and they can actually hear you. 

00:24:40
CARLOS Exactly. 

00:24:40
KEVIN NADAL Okay. Yeah. And what about your relationship with your siblings? What’s that like? 

00:24:45
CARLOS Oh, actually my brother and sister and myself, we all have you know all have, but I have a really good relationship with both of my brother and sister. 

00:24:55
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:55
CARLOS Umm… my sister and I were actually in a car accident… 

00:24:55
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:25:00
CARLOS …prior to me beginning high school and well my sister was a junior in high… or a soft one in high school. 

00:25:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:25:05
CARLOS So, umm… my sister now is physically handicapped… 

00:25:10
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:25:10
CARLOS …and we… we’ve had to change our lifestyle… 

00:25:10
KEVIN NADAL Umm… 

00:25:15
CARLOS …tremendously to accommodate… 

00:25:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:15
CARLOS …to that, so I don’t know my… I don’t know how my brother and sister, they still fight often a lot… 

00:25:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:20
CARLOS …over like again, part of the way that I’m done I’ll fight… 

00:25:25
KEVIN NADAL Yes. 

00:25:25
CARLOS … over little things… 

00:25:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:30
CARLOS …but, I tried to accommodate a lot to my sister… 

00:25:30
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:30
CARLOS …my brother, he and I, we are going… we’ve grown closer over the past few years. 

00:25:35
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:35
CARLOS So we have… I feel like I have a good relationship with both my brother and sister. 

00:25:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:25:45
CARLOS Umm… I guess that’s it… 

00:25:45
KEVIN NADAL Yeah and… and so then that helps and helps to me to understand a little bit, that dynamic a little bit more you know this idea that your parents make sure you’re certain way and then with your umm… your sister’s disability that that adds an even greater dynamic to… to how the whole family may operate. 

00:26:00
CARLOS Yes, actually… 

00:26:05
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:26:05
CARLOS …if I may add something with those. 

00:26:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:26:05
CARLOS Although I have a great… I feel like I have a really great relationship with my brother and sister. My brother is more of a, I don’t know not only bloomer(ph) but he just… he gives the impression that sometimes he just has no drive… 

00:26:20
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:20
CARLOS …or he has so many goals that he doesn’t really accomplish… 

00:26:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:25
CARLOS …and he could be lazy. He could be even very inconsiderate to… not really to me because he and I are really good… are in good… We have a good relationship… 

00:26:35
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:26:35
CARLOS …but more to my mother and father and my sister. 

00:26:35
KEVIN NADAL I see, I see. 

00:26:40
CARLOS So I usually have to pick up a lot of slag and… 

00:26:40
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:26:45
CARLOS …since the accident, I feel like I had to take over my brother’s… I guess my brother’s role of being like the older child… 

00:26:50
KEVIN NADAL I see. 

00:26:50
CARLOS …and being very responsible. 

00:26:50
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:26:50
CARLOS I had to make sure that jobs(ph) were done, had to take care of my sister umm… we all did but… 

00:27:00
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:00
CARLOS …now, I still feel like my sister relies on me much more than she relies on my brother. 

00:27:05
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. 

00:27:05
CARLOS And I think that’s a… I don’t know I just feel like that has to be how it is right now just… 

00:27:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:27:10
CARLOS …of how my brother is and how I had to assume a certain role… 

00:27:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:27:15
CARLOS …within all little triad… 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. 

00:27:20
CARLOS … the three of us and then within, maybe within our family as well. 

00:27:20
KEVIN NADAL Right, right. So we’ve been speaking for about 30 minutes and then I think it’s interesting because even though it's… it’s been such a short period of time I’ve learned a lot about umm… your parents and your siblings and even just how the whole family operates. Umm… but I think this is something that can be explored even further you know to be able for us, first to be able to talk about umm… even more depth about your feelings, about your father and your mother, the… the… the emotions that you might have towards your brother, I mean in some of his… his situation and… and with your sister even umm… you know, I know that’s probably a whole another session that we could have for… 

00:28:00
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:28:00
KEVIN NADAL …several sessions on the idea of getting into car accident and especially you know, umm… that that it left her to… to be disabled. Umm… but umm… what I think we could do is we can continue to talk about these family issues and then we can look at how these family issues then affect every other aspect of your life you know, you talked a little bit about growing up in your neighborhood, in your community, umm… but how do these family issues you know how might they umm… relate to your school and your work and your relationship, your romantic relationships and your friendships and so forth. I mean, it’s like that’s definitely something umm… that we could do. And… and again I… I… I thank you for coming. I think that this is a good first step, yu know it’s very hard for… for a lot of time for people to… to talk about their problems and umm… and I think that you know you’re… you are very umm… brave and taking the step. So… so, I thank you. And I guess I just wanted to end by just asking you what umm… what’s it been like to talk about these… these things with me? 

00:29:00
CARLOS It’s… actually I said it before and I would say I repeat it. umm… I feel like it’s been very therapeutic. I feel a lot better now. 

00:29:05
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:29:10
CARLOS Ah… just to focus on these issues sometimes, I guess every once in a while I think about it. 

00:29:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:29:15
CARLOS And at those times, it’s just… I just feel like I have no one to really speak to. 

00:29:20
KEVIN NADAL Sure, sure. 

00:29:25
CARLOS Umm… so, I guess to bring it up… 

00:29:25
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:25
CARLOS …today was a good thing, like you said a good step. 

00:29:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. And… and you know and one thing just to point out is that you said that you felt this way feeling ah… being lifted and we’ve only talked for 30 minutes. So imagine when we talk once a week umm… about these issues how… how much better you might feel. So I’ll see you next week. 

00:29:45
CARLOS Sure. 

00:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Alright, thank you. 

00:29:45
CARLOS Okay, thank you. 

00:29:45
KEVIN NADAL Take care. 

00:29:50
De-Briefing of Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Carlos 

00:29:50
KEVIN NADAL So Carlos, what was it like talking with me today? 

00:29:55
CARLOS It was really good. I was struck. It was loosely structured, but you kept me on the… on the right path during our conversation. I mean I had noticed myself kind of touch… I actually touched on a lot of different things. 

00:30:10
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:30:10
CARLOS And you helped me know on specific topic. So that directed what I was thinking and I got to focus more… more so… more so on those issues. 

00:30:20
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:30:20
CARLOS You also gave me good feedback… 

00:30:25
KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:30:25
CARLOS …and good questions to think about. So my answers were a bit more… more directed I… I suppose. 

00:30:35
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… Yeah, one thing that I noticed is that you came in here without necessarily a… a huge problem that you said I just wanted to come in and talk about my family and then as we talked more, we discovered a lot more emotions… 

00:30:45
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:30:45
KEVIN NADAL …about these various things. What was that like talking about these things? Do you expect to talking about some of these things today? 

00:30:50
CARLOS Umm… I actually wanted… oh I guess so. I wanted to talk a little bit more about my brother coming in… 

00:31:00
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:31:00
CARLOS I guess. 

00:31:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:00
CARLOS But being able to speak about my parents, specifically my father… 

00:31:05
KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:05
CARLOS … ah… I thought that I was really good because it’s like when… when it came up in the conversation, it’s just a light went off from my house, oh yeah, that’s what I want to talk about too. 

00:31:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:31:15
CARLOS You know this is a big thing that’s going on my mind. 

00:31:15
KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:31:20
CARLOS Maybe I should you know mention it now. 

00:31:20
KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:31:20
CARLOS So, I thought that was also really good way to… 

00:31:25
KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:31:25
CARLOS …move from issue to issues. 

00:31:25
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:31:25
CARLOS Even though, you didn’t even know I guess. 

00:31:30
KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. And I think it’s great because next time, we could talk about your umm… your brother and… and sometimes you know umm… we enter these counseling sessions not knowing that we have these… these feelings about something else. 

00:31:40
CARLOS Yeah. 

00:31:40
KEVIN NADAL So maybe you… you were focused on your brother and maybe you were able to connect to some of these feelings you had about your father and maybe even your mother that you had mentioned as well. Umm… so, yeah, I just wanted to… to thank you again for being a part of this counseling session and umm… again, as I thought you’ve done very well. 

00:32:00
CARLOS Okay. Thank you very much. 

00:32:00
KEVIN NADAL So, thank you.
