Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:10
WINNIE KING , MD Hello. I’m Dr. Winnie King here in the lobby of the Children’s hospital at Montefiore in New York City and today we are going to find out how to prevent child abuse. Its parents and caregivers who abuse children so its parents and caregivers who have to learn what causes it and how to avoid it. We begin with the story of one parent who lost control and because of that she lost her children. Here is that story through her eyes. 

00:01:35
JACKIE RAMIREZ In terms of umm… my experience being a journey it has been a journey. Umm… I don’t think it's over yet. It was Morganton, North Carolina. Umm… it’s a county seat for both county 79 is when it was. I lost control with my first two children. They had instructions to stay on the carport after they got off the school bus and wait till my mother got home every day my daughter came and told me that my son had disobeyed and everyday he had some kind of a punishment whether it was restricting toys or play time or TV time. I talk to some of my relatives about it and they had said that if I was doing what I should be doing then, I should… I wouldn’t be having that problem. One day my daughter came out and was pleased to tell me that her brother had disobeyed once again and I figured if a belt works on me when I was a kid then maybe that’s really what they needed. When I found out she was doing that to get him in trouble, I just really lost it. I totally lost it. I wiped him with the belt. I stopped when I got tired and the next morning when they got up I noticed they were marks on the arms and told them that if the teacher notice the marks please tell her what happened and why it happened. It was called discipline. I figured that the teacher would understand and you know, reinforce obeying at school and at home as well and the next thing I know I get a call and they had taken the kids and placed them in foster care. I didn’t know there was such a thing as child abuse at that time and when the kids did come back my daughter had the idea that they were allowed to do anything they wanted to and there was no punishment because that’s what the social worker told her. I can’t even describe how I felt. I felt punched in the stomach, I felt betrayed because I was their mom. I have to discipline. I have… discipline means to teach and if you can’t teach them what good are you. I mean you… your nothing as a parent. I knew that if I did stay I would eventually lose it again. That’s when I really decided I had to leave North Carolina. People that I had known all my life treated me badly. People who went to my church spat at me. Umm… it was hard but that that kinda made me easier to leave. It wasn’t easy and I knew I would be judged as mother who left her children. 

00:04:35
WINNIE KINGS And here in the studio with us right now is Jackie Ramirez and I know that’s… that’s hard to watch isn’t it? 

00:04:40
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… Hmm… It really is… 

00:04:40
WINNIE KINGS You know it brings back a lot of… a lot of memories. Jackie you say that um, you left your children in North Carolina with their father. 

00:04:50
JACKIE RAMIREZ Yeah. 

00:04:50
WINNIE KINGS Do you still have a relationship with your children? 

00:04:50
JACKIE RAMIREZ Yes I did leave them with their dad and I keep in close hard contact with my daughter and my son is in the army in Georgia. 

00:05:00
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. Well, that’s good… 

00:05:00
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… 

00:05:00
WINNIE KINGS That's good. Help us to understand that what was going on in… in your mind when you were hitting your children. Did you feel as if you were abusing them? 

00:05:10
JACKIE RAMIREZ Not at that time. I didn’t think so. 

00:05:10
WINNIE KINGS But what did it… what was it to you to do that? 

00:05:15
JACKIE RAMIREZ Trying to get them to mind to obey, to listen to me and do what they were supposed to do. 

00:05:20
WINNIE KINGS Now you had a lot… you were single parent at that time. 

00:05:20
JACKIE RAMIREZ Yeah. 

00:05:20
WINNIE KINGS Well you… you… you were the primary breadwinner of the home… 

00:05:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right… Right… 

00:05:25
WINNIE KINGS …and so you had to go to work and so you couldn’t… 

00:05:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… Hmm… 

00:05:25
WINNIE KINGS …have your kids out there. 

00:05:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. I had to work. 

00:05:30
WINNIE KINGS Okay and so the idea of them being undisciplined and running around caused additional stress for you. 

00:05:35
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. 

00:05:35
WINNIE KINGS And that’s what lead to even more problems. 

00:05:35
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. 

00:05:35
WINNIE KINGS Okay now we are gonna be hearing more about your story in just a few minutes but I want to introduce Sidney Johnson now. Sidney is the president of Prevent Child America and he flew here from the Groups headquarters in Chicago and also a Dr. Christopher Greeley, the director of the Child Abuse and Neglect Program in the Vanderbilt University's children’s hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. Welcome gentlemen both of you to this show. 

00:05:55
SIDNEY JOHNSON Thank you. 

00:05:55
DR. CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Thank you. 

00:06:00
WINNIE KINGS We appreciate having you here. Um, let's start out with… with you said, Child abuse. Everyone has heard of it but we don’t know how common it is. Is this a common phenomena in our country? 

00:06:05
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III Prevent Child Abuse America It's more common than we like to think of. Each year there are three million reports of child abuse of which about a million are confirmed. 

00:06:15
WINNIE KINGS Three million? 

00:06:15
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III Three million. Every day three children die from child abuse from neglect in this country and the fact is that experts when they count the ones who are unreported think the figures are probably three times as… 

00:06:30
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:06:30
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III …high and sadly after six years of decrease in the last two years, child abuse has started to increase again in this country. 

00:06:35
WINNIE KINGS Really? 

00:06:40
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III Yes. 

00:06:40
WINNIE KINGS Well now we… when we say child abuse we typically think of physical child abuse but there is actually four types. It’s the physical, there is the emotional, there is sexual and there is also neglect. But when it comes to actual physical abuse what's the… where is the… where is the line between abuse and discipline. 

00:06:55
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III That’s a very hard line to draw. Most state laws indicate that if um, physical abuse breaks a bond, leaves a bruise, leaves a mark. That could be considered child abuse and should be investigated. Many people think that may be too higher standard that they are hurts the don’t show like that that in fact are child abuse. 

00:07:20
WINNIE KINGS Is there any quantification in terms of the number of times that a child is punished or spanged or is just … 

00:07:25
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III No. 

00:07:25
WINNIE KINGS …if there is some evident of injury… 

00:07:25
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III That’s correct, 

00:07:25
WINNIE KINGS …after that. 

00:07:25
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III That’s correct. 

00:07:30
WINNIE KINGS Okay. Well Chris lets… let's talk a bit about what's going on inside the mind of a parent when they… I mean, these are not crazy people. 

00:07:35
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY No. 

00:07:35
WINNIE KINGS These are not people that need to be hospitalized and placed on medication. 

00:07:40
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY No. 

00:07:40
WINNIE KINGS Next door neighbors, people across the street, cousins, aunts, uncles are… what's going on in their minds. Are they looking if this is okay. I’m going to mistreat my child. I’m going to abuse my child today. They deserve it. That’s what or is this just a sort of a continuum of discipline and… 

00:07:55
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY , MD Pediatrician It… it really is a… these are neighbors, family members that reach a certain point that they just don’t know how to handle the next set of emotions. They don’t know what to do next. They reach a breaking point. There is something going on that they just can't handle and they don’t recognize those signs and act in a way that may be they may regret. 

00:08:20
WINNIE KINGS Well let's talk a bit about those signs. They really are typically cues. There is things that happen that if you are aware of them you can sort of pick up on them… 

00:08:25
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Hmm… 

00:08:25
WINNIE KINGS …and then realize that you are sort of heading in that direction. 

00:08:30
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Yeah I think that there are a lot of cues that families or people may recognize. Children who become fearful of their parents. Kids who may have suspicious bruises but I also think it's important to recognize that many people may not have those cues. May not realize they are reaching a certain point. May be only after the fact when a child does have some bad outcome or some bad bruising or broken limb. Then they realize that was something they… they should’ve not done. 

00:09:00
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:09:00
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY So it is important direct that may not be cue. 

00:09:00
WINNIE KINGS Jackie did you feel as if there were cues. Did you know when you were going to get to that point with your children? 

00:09:05
JACKIE RAMIREZ At that time, I didn’t realize what those cues where but looking back now I can’t clearly see the were cues. 

00:09:10
WINNIE KINGS What type of cues did you have? 

00:09:15
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… stress from we call as numbness in my check. Just anxiety. 

00:09:25
WINNIE KINGS Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:25
WINNIE KINGS Kind of feeling and inside that… 

00:09:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Yeah yeah. 

00:09:25
WINNIE KINGS …sort of churning… churning… churning feeling… 

00:09:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:30
WINNIE KINGS And it's so important as I am sure you know now also with your involvement with other organization… 

00:09:30
JACKIE RAMIREZ Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:30
WINNIE KINGS …of recognizing those cues because then you can sort of stop it, you can avoid it before it gets to that point. 

00:09:35
Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:40
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. 

00:09:40
WINNIE KINGS Because I'm a New York doctor I’ve seen kids that have been injured and I know you certainly are very familiar. Tell us about the types of injuries that we see in children that have been hurt. 

00:09:45
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Vanderbilt University Children’s Hospital Well I think that… that there is a huge spectrum of injuries from the not so obvious to the very obvious. In larger hospitals for example where I work, we see a lot of kids with broken bones and bad head injuries and… and blindness from these injuries but it's also bruises , it slaps. Its emotional problems from chronic maltreatment or just being in a very bad environment. 

00:10:10
WINNIE KINGS Now we think of child abuse is causing physical injuries. You know you see something, you see a mark, you see a bruise, some swelling. But there are a lot of injuries that really are not detectable just by looking at the child externally that can cause some problems. Tell us about some of those term outcomes. 

00:10:25
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Well, yeah. it’s a very important issue because that complications or the consequences of the… of these injuries can be quite devastating from death or prolonged seizures, blindness, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and not just the physical, organic complications the brain injury but sort of social outcomes, behavior outcomes, long-term outcomes along those one. 

00:10:50
WINNIE KINGS And Sidney you are so familiar with those ones. 

00:10:55
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III Yes. Those are not only the immeasurable and intolerable human pain and suffering. There are very predictable social outcomes that this society does not want. If you are abused and neglected as a child you are more likely to drop out of school to acquire a special education obviously go to foster care and special health care. You are more likely to become a teenage prostitute to be arrested as a juvenile or adult criminal. The… the social ills are phenomenal and when you look at those in financial terms which we did in a study two years ago it caused this country very conservatively 94 billion dollars a year to try to help children after they’ve been hurt. 

00:11:40
WINNIE KINGS So the consequences are so long term. Now Chris tell us about the advanced screening that you do in nurseries. 

00:11:45
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY Well, there are lot of programs for prevention and one are the programs we use in our hospital is we identify mothers or family units who are potentially high risk and what we then do is have social worker and social services try and provide services in the home for that child, recognizing that getting the child off to a good start can be crucial for their long-term outcome. So in our nursery we have social workers visit families and… 

00:12:10
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:12:10
CHRISTOPHER GREELEY …institute services after they are born. 

00:12:15
WINNIE KINGS Hence speaking of visit so that’s very much a part of your program. Tell us about the home visits. 

00:12:20
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III We have a program called healthy family as America in 450 communities across the country. In it we have trained home visitors who meet new parents in the hospital or in prenatal care and offer them home visits… 

00:12:35
WINNIE KINGS Yeah. 

00:12:35
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III …two, three, four times a week for several years to help them understand how a child develops. 

00:12:40
WINNIE KINGS Right. Very exactly. 

00:12:40
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III what it means to be positive parenting. 

00:12:40
WINNIE KINGS While you know our Jim Bunn went along on a home visit to show just exactly what it's like. Let's take a look. 

00:12:50
JIM BUNN Dennise Gonzalez, a young mother with three kids living in one of New York’s toughest neighborhoods. This is her youngest Kiyara(ph). Sometimes dealing with the kids is just too much. 

00:13:00
DENNISE GONZALEZ Home Visit Program Participant If I'll punish her Its okay (inaudible ) something wrong so you gonna do something. 

00:13:10
JIM BUNN Nahila Ayeva is a case worker from a national program called healthy families America. 

00:13:15
NAHILA AYEVA Hi How are you doing? 

00:13:15
DENNISE GONZALEZ Fine thank you. 

00:13:15
JIM BUNN She pays regular visit to Dennise because Dennise’s situation is the kind that can lead to child abuse. 

00:13:25
NAHILA AYEVA Home Visit Case Worker Is it because they don’t have… they can't go to school they don’t know how to... where to go for English languages. This is like that. So when we tell them that we are gonna help them provide those services it relieves their stress. 

00:13:35
So you are really most concerned about the stress of the mother… 

00:13:40
NAHILA AYEVA Mother… 

00:13:40
Because that stress could lead to abuse. 

00:13:40
Yes. 

00:13:40
JIM BUNN During her visits Nahila checks to make sure the apartment is safe for children. She checks on the health of the baby. 

00:13:50
DENNISE GONZALEZ Yes I did to kind a like um… for this we got to go to the hospital. 

00:13:55
JIM BUNN She helps Dennise better manage her expectations of how Kiyara(ph) should behave… 

00:14:00
NAHILA AYEVA Wow. 

00:14:00
JIM BUNN …and what her needs are, the bottom line Nahila teaches how to deal with the frustrations and manage the stresses of parenthood so they won’t grow into child abuse. 

00:14:10
DENNISE GONZALEZ And I have learnt a lot from Nahila you know because um… raising a kid is not easy. 

00:14:15
JIM BUNN Keeping Kids Healthy Just to give you an idea of the enormity of the problem, here in this part of the South Bronx in New York city nearly 5000 children are born every year, fully half of those are considered to be at risk of child abuse. How many can this program reach out to every year not much more than 60 or 70. 

00:14:35
JIM BUNN But for the lucky few like Dennise Gonzalez the healthy families program is a God sent. 

00:14:40
DENNISE GONZALEZ Not always mom putting something in their mouth for them to be quit is you know you just got to play with them, teach them things um… 

00:14:50
Do you feel like you're a better mom now? 

00:14:50
DENNISE GONZALEZ Yes, yes. 

00:14:55
WINNIE KING Lisa White is the Director of the South Bronx Healthy Families Program which runs the home visit program that you just saw. Welcome to the show Lisa. 

00:15:05
LISA WHITE Thank you, thank you. 

00:15:05
WINNIE KING Um… Do home visit really work? 

00:15:05
LISA WHITE Yes they do. 

00:15:05
WINNIE KING Yeah why, what’s so special about that? 

00:15:10
LISA WHITE , CSW South Bronx Healthy Families Well, they found the research in terms of... researcher has shown that there is improved parent child interaction and that ah… in terms of child development, parents are have better knowledge of child development which is very important in terms of child abuse… 

00:15:20
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:15:20
LISA WHITE 0-3 is a very important time and the very tenuous time for parents and the child, so it helps them around those issues and explaining to them what that specific ah… interaction is about for instance exploring what is that so your kid is going to touch everything. 

00:15:35
WINNIE KING And that’s a good thing, that’s not a bad thing. 

00:15:35
LISA WHITE It’s a good thing right, so we don’t want them to feel that way. 

00:15:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:15:40
LISA WHITE In addition to better health outcomes um… immunizations and linking up with um… medical providers, those things are very important. 

00:15:45
WINNIE KING Yeah, Sid what else is out there? 

00:15:50
A. SIDNEY JOHNSON III There are number of good family support programs, parent support programs, our organization has one called circle the parent… parents ah… parents unanimous runs some very good programs. 

00:16:00
WINNIE KING Okay well you know Jackie has actually become a parent leader for one of these support groups, but it was a long process for her to get there including a new beginning with a new family. Here is the rest of her story. 

00:16:10
JACKIE RAMIREZ And I had no intentions of getting involved or having more children at all so ah… I made arrangements and I left and came to New Jersey. I rented a room for the three months and short time thereafter um… a man who was to be my husband, he eventually asked me about getting married and I feel like maybe it was the right time. When Francisca(ph) was born ah… a little over year after we’ve been married and um… it would… it really in the hospital um… I had hard time with him, because it was… it was like having my first daughter all over again. And it was a reminder of what I didn’t have, About three and a half years later, we had our second daughter Kasey(ph) um… and I was… I was okay after that. Well Kasey(ph) was about two, two and a half and for Francisca(ph) was around 6 or 7 something like that, sometimes I would start to get impatient but rather than lose control, I would just stop whatever I was doing and go outside and sit on the steps until I calm down and I was able to go back in and I was really afraid, I was going to start lose it again and I… I couldn't never lose, I couldn't never lose two more, it would just be too hard with the experience of child protective services in North Carolina. I was really terrified to call for help but I eventually knew it was going to be the same thing all over again if I didn’t get help, parents unanimous I, I, I really didn’t think that was what I was looking for I mean I had visions of um… somebody in a trench coat hurt children. We arrived at the building ah it was pretty big and imposing. This is the room where we meet, coming here I remember how afraid I was the first time and I remember standing close to the door so that if I needed to I could make a hasty escape. I don’t there's been one person who has been in this room that I haven’t learned many things from, I still find the group is a safe you know place to be um… even if it's not my issues I know I am helping other people and other people are still helping me, ah… we are very supportive it’s like a family I am not happy into that journey, there… there are still things to do. 

00:19:10
WINNIE KING We were pleased to have Jackie’s daughters Francisca and Kasey here with us and welcome to the show. We're glad you're here. 

00:19:15
FRANCESCA RAMIREZ Thank you. 

00:19:15
KASEY Thank you. 

00:19:15
WINNIE KING You know Jackie tell us about the support groups. What do you get out of them? 

00:19:20
JACKIE RAMIREZ Parent Leader, Parents Anonymous Well, they are very supportive and nobody judges you which was good in my case um… and you go in there and you bring whatever troubles or frustrations you are having at the time ah… a particular issue and you discuss it in the group and you get immediate answers to the problems you’re having. 

00:19:40
WINNIE KING So you are really talking this out with people that are sort of in the same boat with you? 

00:19:40
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. 

00:19:40
WINNIE KING So you sort of feel like okay its' not just me anymore. 

00:19:40
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right. 

00:19:45
WINNIE KING There is other people that have the same feelings that I do. 

00:19:45
JACKIE RAMIREZ Yes. 

00:19:45
WINNIE KING That must be very comforting? 

00:19:45
JACKIE RAMIREZ It is very comforting and we also share phone numbers too. 

00:19:50
WINNIE KING Did they give you specific techniques, things to handle stresses and frustrations. 

00:19:55
JACKIE RAMIREZ Counting ah… you just learn how to reframe things the way you think about a situation. Ah… I always like to think of things in terms of ten years. 

00:20:05
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:20:05
JACKIE RAMIREZ Is it going to matter in ten years, which helps. 

00:20:10
WINNIE KING Putting it all in perspective. 

00:20:10
JACKIE RAMIREZ Right, right. 

00:20:10
WINNIE KING Francisca you watched your mom, go through all these with the support groups… 

00:20:15
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:15
WINNIE KING …what changes do you discover in her? 

00:20:15
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ Jackie’s Daughter Right away she was more calm, she was more patient with us especially the, the breathing she'd count to ten. 

00:20:25
WINNIE KING Hmm… Hmm… 

00:20:25
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ You know and it instead of that inst reaction or just say get out of my sight right now you know… 

00:20:30
WINNIE KING And you actually you saw pamphlets, you saw things around the house and so you were reading the pamphlets? 

00:20:35
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ Yeah, they were just lying around and I picked them up and looked the pictures and read everything and I see you know this a good idea. This is something you know I didn't know that you could teach parents how the parent... 

00:20:45
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:45
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ And I didn't know anything that she was doing was wrong but after she started going I saw such an improvements in those… 

00:20:55
WINNIE KING Especially on Tuesday, what is so special about Tuesday’s? 

00:21:00
FRANCISCA RAMIREZ Tuesday’s were the day she had the Parents Anonymous meetings and it was like um... a refresher for her, every Tuesday. She will come back and there was an instant change all over again so… 

00:21:10
WINNIE KING And so you could really see that there was something specific that was happening to your mom as a result of this. Jackie what else did you learn in those support groups? 

00:21:20
JACKIE RAMIREZ Um...basically how to do other things instead of reaching out and hurting your kids. 

00:21:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:21:25
JACKIE RAMIREZ Um… one instance um... I know I had a yellow plate um… that Kasey broke and she was oh… terribly upset which she had broken because she knew I really liked it and um… I said you know it’s just a plate, but those are the kind of techniques you just learn in the group. 

00:21:40
KASEY RAMIREZ Yeah. 

00:21:40
WINNIE KING And prior to going into the support groups, how do you think you'd have reacted? 

00:21:45
JACKIE RAMIREZ I don’t know I probably would have yield may be clean it up or I don’t know… I really don’t know. I don’t know without that training I don’t know what I would have done. 

00:21:55
WINNIE KING Very common you know this is really encouraging to hear the change that so palpable even in you and also your daughter, seeing this Lisa I mean this is amazing what, what are some of the things that go on in the support groups that give these sorts of outcomes. 

00:22:10
LISA WHITE I think that they have mentioned a lot of different things. They talked about coping mechanisms um that goes back into how to respond when she dropped the plate and I thought that, that was you know how to deal with that situation um... they talk about taking timeouts, taking a moment to relax. I think some of the most important things in terms of preventative pieces(ph) is that I’d like that the group piece(ph) is good but it doesn’t always have to be a formal group but it could be informal group. It could be a group of friends you know that you’ve developed those who have commonalities to help with that support where you can share information. Um… I think that is important that parents take care of themselves. I think that if you don’t take care of yourself, then you cannot be hold for your family. 

00:22:45
WINNIE KING That’s true. 

00:22:45
LISA WHITE And you have to put yourself as a priority and those are things that are very important. 

00:22:50
WINNIE KING And if you are not taking care of yourself then you feel as if the reason why you’re not is because of your child. 

00:22:55
LISA WHITE Hmm… hmm…. 

00:22:55
WINNIE KING And that sort of helps create that resentment that boy, if it weren't for my child you know my needs are not being met, everybody is getting their needs met but me of course we all are going to feel sort of put down by that in angry and it's easy to take that on the child.
