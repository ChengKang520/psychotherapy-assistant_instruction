DERALD WING SUE Again, good afternoon everyone and welcome to the presentation by Doctor Kevin Nadal today. The title of this presentation is A State of Emergency: Advocating for Transgender People of Color. I'm especially proud to be able to Kevin, because he was a former student of mine and has done exceptionally well, has contributed much. Doctor Kevin Leon Nadal is an Associate Professor of Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York. He has published over 60 works on multicultural issues in the field of psychology and education. He was once named one of People Magazine's hottest bachelors, which will end tomorrow from what I hear. He once won an argument with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor and I did tune in and see that dialogue and I felt that Kevin was very mean to poor O'Reilly. He has been featured on PBS, The Weather Channel, The History Channel and HGTV. And he was once even a hot topic on ABC's The View, that my wife loves to watch all the time. He is author of the books "Filipino American Psychology," published by Wiley in 2011. And he is also author of "That's So Gay: Microaggressions and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community," that was published by APA last year. And just for your information, it has already made the bestsellers list in APA. He is a current Vice-President of the Asian American Psychological Association and a trustee of the Filipino Americans National Historical Society. I'm going to turn it over to Kevin right now and tell him once again how proud I am of him.

LGBTQ Terms Gender: A socially constructed identity that is usually determined by one's biological sex (or whether one has male or female reproductive organs). Gender Nonconformity: The trait or identity of not adhering to gender role expectations 

00:03:00
LGBTQ Terms Gender Identity: An individual's personal sense of identification as male or female or another gender Sexual Orientation: An individual's sense of personal and social identity based on one's sexual attractions, behaviors expressing those sexual attractions, and membership in a community of others who share them 

00:03:00
LGBTQ Terms Transgender is an umbrella term that can be used to refer to anyone for whom the sex she or he was assigned at birth is an incomplete or incorrect description of herself or himself.

Anti-Transgender Violence One report found that from the beginning of 2008 to the middle of 2009, there were 200+ anti-transgender murders alone worldwide, equaling approximately 19 transgender murders per month. Another report found that in the US, there were 16 anti-transgender murders in 2013. Majority were transgender women of color. 

00:03:00
Transgender People and Hate Crimes Most LGBT hate crimes go unreported, are misclassified, or are not publicized by the media. In 2012, there were 1376 hate crime incidents based on sexual orientation in the US (19% of all hate crimes) The Hate Crimes Act is required to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. 

00:03:00
Transgender People and Discrimination A study of 6450 transgender people in US and Puerto Rico: Survey respondents experience unemployment at twice the rate of the population as a whole. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of those surveyed reported experiencing harassment or mistreatment on the job. Forty-seven percent (47%) had experienced an adverse job outcome, such as being fired, not hired or denied a promotion. Fifteen percent (15%) of transgender people in our sample lived on $10,000 per year or less, double the rate of the general population. Nineteen percent (19%) have faced eviction and 20% were found to seek temporary space. 

00:03:00
Transgender People and Microaggressions Microaggressions are defined as brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults. Originally derived from research on racial microaggressions 

00:03:00
Taxonomy of Sexual Orientation and Transgender microaggressions Use of heterosexist/transphobic terminology Endorsement of heteroconformative culture/behaviors Assumption of universal LGBT experience Exoticization Discomfort/disapproval of LGBT experience Denial of societal heterosexism/transphobia Assumption of sexual pathology/abnormality Denial of individual heterosexism/transphobia Denial of Bodily Privacy Physical Threats 

00:03:00
Types of Microaggressions Heterosexist/Transphobic Language I remember one time before I transitioned when I first moved to New York. I was on the train with my roommate, who was a non-transgender woman of color. A young African American guy was like, "Yo, yo, is that a due or is that a woman." I was walking one time to the post office and I had just recently had my lips done and a little five year old kid said, "Daddy, daddy. Hey daddy, that's a shemale." so he never referred to me as a man. He referred to me as ... A shemale. 

00:03:00
Types of Microaggressions Exoticization [Men often tell me], "You're not girlfriend material. All I want from you is that sexual asset and that whole thrill of being with a transsexual and go on with my life and act like you never exist." Now, not only am I being objectified and sensationalized, I'm being less than human. 

00:03:00
Types of Microaggressions Discomfort/Disapproval of Transgender Experience [An acquaintance tried to question my gender and she [also] found out I was talking to a guy. One day, I happened to walk down the same block as that gentleman was and he moved to the left and I kept moving forward. He waved "hi" but it was like he was ashamed, like I was a disease. I was definitely hurt. In the end, I found out she told him that I was a man. 

00:03:00
Types of Microaggressions Denial of Bodily Privacy This guy was like, "Yo, is that a dude or is that a woman" and I was like, "Alright, okay. Let's see how far this goes." And then he came up to me and said, "Yo, yo, you have a dick or pussy? A dick or pussy?" And I was just like, "Why does it matter?" [Someone] told some students "That's a man!" and students looked at me and were like, "What, that's not a man. Look at her face and she has breasts. That's not a man." So they were standing and looking at me like if I was a circus freak, you know as usual. 

00:03:00
Types of Microaggressions Physical threats or harassment I can remember when just walking in the street and I could have been with my friend and someone would have said ..."Those are men"... and they would actually walk up to us ... You know ... All make faces, laugh and tell other people in front of us ... some people would come up to us ... call us names ... and that can happen from time to time ...

00:03:00
KEVIN NADAL I am very honored and happy to be here. As Derald mentioned, this is my alma mater and it really is meaningful for me to be-, I don't know why I'm getting emotional. Particularly because I was a student here and I used to come to these conferences all the time. Part of the reason why I went to Teachers College is because of conferences like this and our program's commitment to multiculturalism and social justice. And so it's really humbling to be on this side of the podium now giving a presentation on something that's really near and dear to my heart. The title of my presentation is A State of Emergency: Advocating for Transgender People of Color. I titled this A State of Emergency and I'm taking it, borrowing it from Laverne Cox. Many of you might know Laverne Cox as an actress on the television show "Orange is the New Black." Is that what it's called? Yes, it is. I don't watch the show, actually, so I don't know her from that work. I actually am more familiar with her work as an activist in the LGBTQ community. And I attended a benefit where she was honored not too long ago and she mentioned a quote that goes something like this, "It's a state of emergency for far too many trans people in this country." And what she means by this is that while it's important to advocate for LGBT issues in other parts of the world, particularly now there's a focus on what's happening in Russia and the Olympics and some of the anti-LGBT laws over there. It's important to also look at what's happening in our own backyard. I'm going to talk a lot today about transgender people and particularly transgender people of color and some of the experiences that they're having. It's devastating to know that so much wrong and harm is being done to this community and we often times don't know about it. And so when I was asked to speak at the roundtable, I had a lot of different ideas of what I could potentially talk about. But it was important for me to talk about something that I knew probably wouldn't be mentioned much at this conference, the experience of transgender people. Before I start, I want to give a brief overview of our-, of the presentation. I'll do a quick introduction of the presentation and actually about my own personal journey. I'll do a brief overview of LGBT terms and a brief history of LGBTQ people. Unfortunately, we have to do some of these introductions because a lot of times people don't come with the knowledge of some of these LGBTQ experiences. I'm also going to talk about experiences of transgender people of color regarding hate crimes, discrimination and microaggressions. And then finally we'll end with what can we do? I really want to end early so that I can, we can engage in some dialogue and talk about what we really can do. I want to start off with my personal journey. I'm Filipino American and as a Filipino I come from a long trajectory of story telling. In Tagalog we call it cuento cuento (ph), which means telling your stories and passing on your oral histories to future generations. This is me. I don't know how old I am. I'm probably three. I was born and raised in California in a really large Filipino American population. My high school was 50 percent Filipino with a majority of the other classmates being Latino. And so I was always in a classroom where there were people that looked like me, which is quite different than what I imagine many people of color experience in this country. As a result of that, you know, I think that it may have been much more difficult for me to accept my sexual identity as a gay man because of some of those values of the Filipino American community, particularly Catholicism, which may have impeded me from being comfortable with who I am. I also realize as I look through some of my pictures that I was totally gay. I mean, look at that. I'm striking a pose. That's quite fierce right there. I like to title this photograph easy, breezy, beautiful. Look at that. I am the youngest of two boys, and so I think growing up in a household with men, where boys are being raised to be men and what it means to be a man particularly was an obstacle to me becoming comfortable with my sexual orientation and identity. As you see, my brothers and I were taught to like sports and we were taught to be masculine and to be men. And we heard messages like boys don't cry. And so again, hearing those things on a daily basis, whether overtly or even subtly, how can that potentially have a negative impact on somebody who struggles with their identity. As you see in this picture, I didn't like playing sports. Look how miserable I am playing sports. But look how happy I am to strike a pose and dance. On the right, this is from a jazz dance performance, and I'm so happy. And I bring this to you, not only because I want to show you my cute baby pictures, but because I want just for you all to think about how you were raised as a child. What were some of the gender messages that you learned from a very early age. And if you have children, whether your own or other children in your life, what are the subtle things that we're teaching them about gender? How would my life have been different if I was taught from an early age that it was okay to like the arts? It was okay to like to dance and not to play sports. How did some of those pressures and expectations that I received from my family, from my community and from the media influence me in both positive and negative ways. My research has really been meaningful for me particularly because I-, the issues that I study are so close and near and dear to my heart. I think it's really important when you can find research topics that you're passionate about. And I think it's okay to do mesearch, which is research that is very personal to you. I've done research over the past ten years or so on issues related to microaggressions. I studied with Derald Wing Sue here and we first started looking at racial microaggressions. Some other colleagues of mine started to think about sexual orientation and gender identity microaggressions. And now my research team, many of who are here, we've studied pretty much every type of microaggression that you can think of, whether it's gender, religion, multiracial identity and so forth. My experience as a Filipino American and Asian American really has influenced my desire to advocate for social justice and for marginalized communities. Because Filipino Americans and Asian Americans in general tend to be invisible, tend not to have a voice in the mainstream, it was very important for me to enter this field to give them that voice. And finally I study LGBTQ issues. And I must admit that when I first started studying LGBTQ issues, I definitely neglected the T when I first started this work. Part of it was because of my own privilege and not really quite understanding the experiences of transgender people because as a gay man that was what was most important to me. And as I started to do some of this research, it was very-, it became very salient in my life to advocate as much as I could for transgender communities because I know that there are very few people that have been able to do that. I bring my awareness of my privilege as a cisgender person and knowing that perhaps we need to also foster and encourage transgender people to enter fields like academia. But as I go through my presentation, I'll talk a little bit about some of the things that might impede that from occurring. I mentioned before that I wish we didn't have to go through some of these terms, but a lot of times, people are unfamiliar with these terms or just may not-, we may not all be on the same page regarding some of these terms. Gender is a socially constructed identity that is usually determined by one's biological sex or whether one has male or female reproductive organs. Gender is different from sex. We were not raised-, we were not born to have a gender. We learned that over time from a very early age when your parents put you in pink or blue or in dresses or in pants. You're already learning subtle messages about gender. When someone doesn't feel that they match the birth sex that they were assigned when they were a baby, that become difficult for them to resolve these issues of gender because they may not feel like the gender that they were assigned to. Gender nonconformity is the trait or identity of not adhering to gender role expectations. I say both trait and identity because it could be on-, it could be both. For example, someone can engage in gender nonconforming behaviors but still identify as a cisgender person, cisgender meaning somebody whose identity, gender identity, matches the birth-, their birth sex. But also it could be an identity in itself. So somebody could have a gender nonconforming identity in that they identify as someone who either has no gender or identifies with, as both male or female. Gender identity is an individual's personal sense of identification as male or female or another gender. A lot of times cisgender people don't even realize that they have a gender identity because it matches that of the mainstream society. But for people who are transgender, or gender nonconforming or gender queer, they get to choose their identity. And what happens a lot of times is that people force them to not be able to. Sexual orientation is an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on sexual attractions, behaviors expressing those sexual attractions, and membership in a community of others who share them. A lot of times people mix up sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, many time people assume that if you're a gay man that you really want to be a woman. Sometimes people assume that if you're a lesbian that you're supposed to be masculine or that you want to be a man. When in reality these are two completely different concepts. So somebody can be a transgender person and maybe they're a transgender man and they are sexually attracted to women. And so maybe they would identify as a heterosexual transgender person. So it's really important for us to know that there are differences between gender identity and sexual orientation. And that there are so many different combinations of how someone can identify. And transgender is a word that I'm going to use a lot today. And it's actually an umbrella term that can be used to refer to anyone for whom the sex she or he was assigned at birth is an incomplete or incorrect description of her or himself. I like this definition a lot because it talks about not just people who might transition into the gender that they most identify with, but it also can be an umbrella term for people who maybe it's an incomplete or incorrect description. So maybe somebody might identify as gender queer and they would be able to fall under the transgender category. Now the reason why I bring up all these things is because I think it's really important for us to have a context when we're talking about transgender people and particularly transgender people of color. My presentation today is focusing specifically on this community because of some of the latest happenings and some of the atrocities that have been occurring within these communities and towards these communities. And I want to start off with a quick exercise. And I'm going to show you some faces, and I want you to raise your hand if you know who these people are. Do people know who Matthew Shepard is? Okay. So Matthew Shepard was a young man who was killed in the late nineties in Laramie, Wyoming for being gay. There have been lots of media attention that has been paid towards him and he even has a Matthew Shepard Foundation, which his mother started, which does a lot of work in advocating for LGBTQ issues. Matthew Shepard is also the namesake of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Junior Hate Crimes Act, which was signed by President Obama in 2009, which added sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected class when somebody is a victim of a hate crime. Prior to that if you were killed or assaulted for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, it would not be classified as a hate crime. But it wasn't until 2009 that President Obama recognized that. How many people know who Mark Carson is? Show of hands? Mark Carson was an African American man who was killed in New York City on May 17, 2013. He was killed in the heart of the West Village. And part of the reason why I'm emotional is because it could have been any of us. People think of New York City as being such a diverse place, and it is. However, why is it that we don't know about Mark Carson? Why is it that when the news channels were publicizing or telling his story that they paid very little attention to him. He died the same week that Jodie Arias' trial was going on, and some media analysts looked at some data and they found that most of the major networks gave Jodie Arias' trial over seven hours that week. And Mark Carson, on certain channels got as little as nothing, which was on Fox News. MSNBC gave him seven minutes of all the week and CNN gave him about one minute. And so why is it that this man who died for being gay in the heart of the West Village, which was blocks away from Stonewall, why is it that we don't know his name? How many people know who Sakia Gunn is? Sakia was killed in 2004. Some of Sakia's friends say that Sakia identified as a lesbian. Sakia was in her teens. Some people say that Sakia identified as a transgender man. Sakia was with Sakia's friend in New Jersey, where a man was bothered by Sakia's gender presentation and he killed her, or he killed Sakia. This was five years after Matthew Shepard's death and yet Sakia does not get the attention that Matthew Shepard did. Steven Lopez Mercado, does anyone know who he is? In 2009, Steven Lopez Mercado was dressed in drag. Some friends of his said that he identified as a gay man. Other people said he may have identified on the gender spectrum. Steven Mercado, his story is similar to a lot of people who have been victimized by hate crimes. His story is unique though because the person who killed him didn't just murder him. They dismembered him. And so why is this not on the news? Why do people not know about these things? Islan Nettles? Do people know Islan Nettles? Last year Islan Nettles was killed in Harlem, block away from here. Islan Nettles was identified as a transgender woman. As you can see, she's also a woman of color. Her assailant, his charges just got dropped about a month ago and last week he went missing. Too many transgender people, particularly transgender women of color, are being assaulted and killed and their murderers go free. Why don't we know about Islan Nettles? And Cece McDonald, does anyone know her? Cece was being assaulted by a man, essentially, who again was bothered by her gender presentation. Cece fought back and she ended up killing the guy after he was the one who started the attack. Cece was sentenced to be in jail and it wasn't until a month ago that she was released on parole. So to understand that not only are transgender people getting victimized and brutalized. But if they fight back, they're going to jail. When we think about transgender violence, I think it's important to look at statistics. But I think it's also important to realize that statistics may not necessarily be as accurate. Violence towards transgender people is often unreported. Sometimes police officers don't label it as such. And we'll talk a little bit about some of these specific statistics. But one report found that from the beginning of 2008 to the middle of 2009, there were 200 anti-transgender murders alone worldwide, equaling approximately 19 transgender murders per month. And another report found that in the US, that last year in 2013, that there were 16 anti-transgender murders and the majority were transgender women of color. Again, most of these assailants, perpetrators, have not been charged with any crimes. When we look at hate crimes, again we must know that hate crimes are often unreported. That when a transgender person is victimized perhaps she or he does not want to go to the police because they're afraid of being traumatized again. That police officers are often quite insensitive to transgender people and so why would you want to report a crime if you know that you are going to be discriminated against once you get to the police station? Sometimes they're misclassified. When a transgender person is assaulted, for example, sometimes police officers don't label it as a hate crime, or sometimes they label it as a gay hate crime. Now, again, while the LGBT community is one that you know, we want to be united, and we are united in many ways, it's important to distinguish that the transgender hate crimes need to be distinguished from the other types of hate crimes that occur. In 2012, according to the FBI, there were 1376 hate crime incidents based on sexual orientation in the U.S., which is about 19 percent of all hate crimes. Now, what's interesting is that they say that about ten percent of the population identifies as LGBT, maybe even less than that, five to ten percent are what some of the surveys are saying. That why are 20 percent of hate crimes anti-LGBT. That's a disproportionately higher number. Again, why is it only focusing on sexual orientation? The FBI should be identifying gender identity hate crimes as well given that President Obama signed the Hate Crimes Act in 2009. But still, up until this day, they are not classifying them as such. And as I mentioned, the Hate Crimes Act is now required to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. When it comes to discrimination in general, it's not just that transgender people have to worry about walking down the streets without being harassed or without being assaulted. But here are some of the latest findings about transgender peoples' experiences. In a study of 6450 transgender people in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, it was found that the participants experienced unemployment at twice the rate of the population as a whole. That 97 percent of those surveyed reported experiencing harassment or mistreatment on the job. That's pretty much 100 percent, almost every single transgender person is saying they've been harassed or mistreated at the job. 47 percent have experienced an adverse job outcome such as being fired, not hired or denied a promotion. 15 percent lived on 10,000 dollars per year or less, which is double the rate of the general population, where about seven percent of the general population live on that salary. And 19 percent of the sample have been homeless. 11 percent have faced eviction, and 26 were forced to seek temporary space. So as we see, there are a lot of barriers that transgender people have, but yet, many people are unaware of these barriers and so these trends continue. When it comes to microaggressions, Derald Sue is the king of microaggressions, which sounds funny because that means that he's committing microaggressions. But when we started studying microaggressions in 2006 and 2007, again we first started to look at race. But now we're moving to look at other identities as well. Microaggressions are defined as brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults. People of marginalized groups tend to experience the most microaggressions. And a lot of studies are finding that people of these groups, when they experience microaggressions also report things like mental health issues, self-esteem issues, and even performance issues. So likely to not do as well academically. Some study came out that microaggressions have been related to binge drinking. So we're seeing a lot of these negative outcomes when it comes to microaggressions. For transgender people, what we have to think about is that not only are they experiencing these really overt and extreme forms of discrimination and harassment, but they also experience microaggressions. While people in general, we might experience microaggressions all the time, we have to realize that we have privilege that maybe experiencing microaggressions isn't as bad in comparison to experiencing microaggressions, systemic discrimination, and fearing for your life on an everyday basis. We, in 2010 some colleagues of mine, David Rivera and Melissa Corpus, we came up with a taxonomy of sexual orientation and gender identity microaggressions that modeled after Derald Sue's article in the American Psychologist. And these were some of the types of microaggressions that we say exist against LGBTQ people. One of them is the use of heterosexist or transphobic language. In some of our studies, with transgender people they reported different types of microaggressions that they experienced and here are some that I want to share. One transgender man says, I remember one time before I transitioned when I first moved to New York. I was on the train with my roommate, who was a non-transgender woman of color. A young African American guy was like, "Yo, yo, is that a due or is that a woman." Another transgender woman said, I was walking one time to the post office and I had just recently had my lips done and a little five year old kid said, "Daddy, daddy. Hey daddy, that's a shemale." so he never referred to me as a man. He referred to me as ... A shemale. Now when we think about this, there are a couple of things that I'd like to point out. One is that walking down the street, people feel that they have the right to talk about you and your identity. While that might happen with some other groups, so for example, as an Asian person walking around in the South, I've had people stop me on the street and say, What are you? I was bothering them that much to be Asian or to be ambiguously racial so that they had to stop me on the street. But for transgender people this happens on a daily basis. People staring at them on the subway. People saying things about them out loud. Not only is it microaggressive, it's just rude. Do we say that about anyone? I see a lot of people in New York who make a lot of bad fashion choices, and I don't say that out loud. I wait till I see my fiance, like a normal person. It's called manners. Exoticization, transgender people often times feel objectified or tokenized. Or people who view them as being prizes or tokens. One transgender woman said, Men often tell me, "You're not girlfriend material. All I want from you is that sexual asset and that whole thrill of being with a transsexual and go on with my life and act like you never exist." Now, not only am I being objectified and sensationalized, I'm being less than human. Piers Morgan the other day interviewed author Janet Mock on his program. And he thought that he was being an ally. He was asking her questions. He was trying to be supportive with her as he interviewed her. But yet, the little headline underneath her name said Janet Mock, was born a man. And then while the program was going on, he tweeted or his people tweeted, what would you do if you found out that your girlfriend was a man? So again, while he might have thought he was being an ally, he was sensationalizing her. He was exoticizing her. He was focusing solely on her transgender identity instead of hearing about her lived experiences. Discomfort or disapproval of transgender experience. This is a transgender woman who was talking about an acquaintance tried to question her gender and then she found out that the transgender woman was talking to a guy. One day, I happened to walk down the same block as that gentleman and he moved to the left and I kept moving forward. He waved "hi" but it was like he was ashamed, like I was a disease. I was definitely hurt. In the end, I found out she told him that I was a man. So again, he or she is living her life, passing, and to pass as a transgender person is a privilege. But somebody found out about her birth sex and then tell someone and now they treat her differently. The denial of bodily privacy is something that came up a lot for transgender people. One person says, This guy was like, "Yo, is that a dude or is that woman" and I was like, "Alright, okay. Let's see how far this goes." And then he came up to me and said, "Yo, yo, you have a dick or pussy? A dick or pussy?" And I was just like, "Why does that matter?" [Someone] told some students "that's a man!" and students looked at me and were like, "What, that's not a man. Look at her face and she has breasts. That's not a man." So they were standing and looking at me like as if I was a circus freak, you know, as usual. Again, why do people feel the need to make comments about transgender people. Why do people feel that they have a right to identify people's body parts? Again, that's being rude. I don't talk about your genitals. Don't talk about transgender people's genitals. Physical threats and harassment. Transgender people talked about on an everyday basis, particularly the transgender women being street harassed. While cisgender women are often street harassed in their lives, for transgender women they talk about one, just how frequent it is and two, how they feel physically threatened. One person says, I can remember just walking in the street and I could have been with my friend and someone could have said, "Those are men"... and they would actually walk up to us, you know, all make faces, laugh and tell other people in front of us. Some people would come up to us, call us names and that can happen from time to time. They, transgender people, a lot of times they're not asking for much. They just want to go to the store, go to the movies, hang out with friends. But yet, they can't even do these simple things because of the harassment that they experience from people who have major biases against this group. When it comes to systemic microaggressions, I think this is important for cisgender people, myself included, to always be aware of because we have so many privileges that transgender people don't and that transgender people experience on a regular basis. When it comes to public restrooms. I had to use the restroom before the talk. I easily went to a restroom that matched the gender that I identify with. For transgender people, there's often the conflict of should I use the restroom of the gender that I identify with. Do I pass enough to use this restroom? If I do use this restroom, will I be harassed or will I be kicked out the building, which is a common experience for a lot of transgender people as well as just gender nonconforming people. So the next time you use the restroom just be aware of that and know that that's a privilege that you have. How many buildings actually have either single stall restrooms or ability accessible restrooms and majority of places might not. In Philadelphia they've just passed a law a few months ago that stated that every government building in Philadelphia has to have three restrooms, one for men, one for women and one for transgender people or people who don't want to use either restroom. When it comes to government ID, it's not easy changing your ID if you're a transgender person. That the government will do everything to prohibit that from happening. And so imagine trying to board a plane and your birth name is on your driver's license and some of the harassment that you might get as a result of that. Even think about the last time you booked a flight. They make you choose your gender. Why do they have to do that? I mean, it's clear that they're going to rationalize and say it's for anti-terrorist reasons, but again, when we do things like that, we are unconsciously or subtly discriminating against transgender people. When it comes to the criminal justice system, when a transgender person does commit a crime, where does she or he go? In most states, transgender people will go to the prison of their birth sex. So imagine what happens when a transgender woman who identifies as a woman has taken hormones so presents as a woman, maybe even has breasts and maybe this person has identified as a-, or living as a transgender woman for years. But she has to go to the male prison. And what are some of the risks that she has in having to be in that prison? If prison systems are at least a little bit aware about transgender issues, sometimes they say, okay, you don't have to be in the male prison, but we'll put you in solitary confinement. And so for many transgender people, it's a Catch 22. Do I want to go to the prison where I can definitely be harassed and maybe even murdered or raped? Or do I want to go to solitary confinement where I will not talk to anyone for hours on end. Again, something that cisgender people often times don't have to think about. And finally the media. How does the media perpetuate some of these biases towards transgender people? I have the picture here of Katie Couric. She interviewed on the left is Carmen Carrera. she was a former reality show star on Rupal's Drag Race. And on the right is Laverne Cox, who I told you about earlier. And Katie Couric, on national television, asked Carmen Carrera very invasive questions about her genitals. Again, I don't ask you about your genitals. Why are you asking transgender people about their genitals? How has the media sensationalized transgender people? How has the media made people even more fearful of transgender people? Why are we giving awards to actors for playing transgender characters instead of making more roles for transgender people to play transgender people? Laverne Cox is noted as the first transgender woman on a major television show or network to be played by a transgender woman. Can you imagine that for any other group? Than an African American is not played by an African American? That a Filipino guy is played by every single other race possible, which is possible because Filipinos look like everything. But, again, why is it that the media perpetuates this? When we talk about intersectional microaggressions, we're talking about the idea that we have many identities, that people possess a race, gender, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, age, socioeconomic status, etcetera. And that when you experience microaggressions, perhaps you're experiencing these on more than one of your identities. Intersectional microaggressions may be experienced by people with two identities, for example a lesbian person of color, a gay person with a disability. And when people experience intersectional microaggressions, it might be even more stressful because you might not realize which identity is being targeted, and if so, how to approach it because it's so loaded. When we look at intersectional microaggressions, it's important for us to realize that within the LGBTQ community that there are a lot of within group microaggressions that a lot of times we don't want to talk about. There's a lot of anti-transgender microaggressions committed by gay, lesbian and bisexual cisgender people. There's a lot of microaggressions from lesbian towards transgender women. For example, any time there are women's conferences or music festivals, cisgender women often times will not allow transgender women to participate because they say that they're not really women. So invalidating might that be to their experiences? And then we look at the experiences of being a person of color. So transgender people of color and LGBT of color in general, not only might they experience exclusion within their own communities, so to be discriminated within the Latino community as a transgender person, but they also might experience discrimination within the LGBT general community. So to be a person of color within a generally white LGBT community. Often times people will deny that there is an existence of LGBT people in communities of color and we see that too often. I think we've come a long way in that people of color are more open to talking about LGBTQ issues. I mean, the title of this conference alone is a demonstration of that. But I think that we need to do more. We need to advocate more for increasing the visibility and advocating for people of color, particularly LGBTQ people of color. I end with this idea of what can we do? There are many things that I can tell you. There are many things that I hope that you'll continue to talk about with your loved ones and your family and friends, and particularly with children because they are the next generation. And they have a say in how this society will end up. I think about recommendations for families. How can we start in the home? How can we teach people about gender in a very real way from a very early age so that people become more comfortable who are gender nonconforming, and for transgender people particularly? When we think about our children, how might we teach them from an early age that it's okay to be gay? It's okay to be transgender. That there are different ways of expressing your gender and your sexual orientation. And maybe we can do this in age appropriate ways. When I think about schools, everything from the practical aspects of schools. Do we have gender accessible bathrooms for everyone? Do we include transgender issues within our classes? In the field of psychology, we are doing some great things when it comes to social justice and in terms of advocating for multiculturalism. But even in our multicultural classes, many times transgender issues go overlooked completely. A recent survey from the American Psychological Association found that majority of programs don't teach about transgender issues at all. And so you have these psychologists who are graduating with their degrees and some who are going into practice who don't have any knowledge or experience about transgender issues. So what would it be like for them when they finally have a transgender client? Are they culturally competent in working with them? When we think about workplaces we not only think about the practical aspects of harassment laws and so forth, but even the subtle things. How are workplace environments welcoming for transgender people? What are some of the jobs that transgender people can even get? As I mentioned before, transgender people tend to be less-, have less access to resources. They tend to be homeless. They tend to make less money. A lot of times they can't get a job. And to think about that. Why is that? Because perhaps many of our fields don't welcome transgender people or might discriminate against them. Think about what transgender people tend to do. A lot of transgender women, for example, maybe they might be able to go into beauty. Maybe they might be able to go into retail work. But they really aren't encouraged to go into these fields that may require more education and so forth. Recommendations for neighborhoods and communities. How can we advocate for transgender people in any of communities that we belong to, whether it be a racial ethnic community, your neighborhoods that you live in, even in our psychology community. How many times do we bring up transgender issues? How many conferences, which are very diverse in many types of cultural identities. How many times do they fail to recognize transgender issues? And then when it comes to government, I think it's important to bring this up because a lot of times people feel we can't do anything with the government. That's all lawmakers and so forth. But we really do need to pressure our lawmakers and our policy makers to be more inclusive of transgender people. The ENDA Act, which may potentially be passed relatively soon, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. It doesn't protect for transgender people. So while LGB people may be protected if they're ever fired for being LGB, transgender people may not. And part of the reason why they don't include transgender people in this act is because they're afraid that if they include transgender people in the act that the bill will not pass. And so it's kind of hurtful because here you're saying that you want to be recognized but you're not recognizing that in doing so that you're disallowing people to have the same privilege that you're fighting for yourself. When you look at states that there are, majority of states that you could be fired for being transgender for no other reason besides being transgender. We need to contact our policy makers and make sure that that discontinues. I want to share one last story and then we'll end. One thing-, about a month ago a friend of mine was brutally attacked in Midtown Manhattan. He identifies as a gay man and when he was attacked, he was left unconscious on a street and we wondered if it was a hate crime. And my first instinct is that it was because in New York City the number of hate crimes towards gay men and transgender women has doubled this past year. And what happened was that he was left unconscious. And when our circle of friends found out about this we really pushed for the case to be taken up. His husband, my friend Randy's husband, said that when he tried to call the police to follow up with what happened, that he was told that the detective went on vacation and would be back next week. When Steven, who's Randy's husband, told us this, we went, can I say it, batshit crazy. How ridiculous that the detective who's focusing on this case that may potentially be a hate crime, how can he leave during this time? So many of us advocated and we called the police department. And then we went to the media. We went to the media and within days every single major news network was talking about Randy's story. You may have seen it. His name is Randy Jenner. He's better now. He went through a few brain surgeries and now they're questioning if it was a hate crime and the one thing that I do want to mention with this story is that Randy's one of the lucky ones. One is that he was able to survive from this atrocious act. But two, he was able to have a community of people who made his story known, who advocated for him, who raised 60,000 dollars for him, for his medical expenses, who the media paid attention to for some reason, maybe because of pressure from our community maybe because it was a slow news day or week. But he was one of the lucky ones. When I think about people like Islan Nettles or Mark Carson or Cece McDonald, to know that perhaps if they had people that advocated for them more that maybe that their assailants would be tried in a just way. And then I think about people whose names I don't know because they are the people that experience this on an everyday basis. They are the brave souls who are facing so much atrocities and so much pain in their lives that go neglected. Sometimes when they die, we don't even know what happened and it's as if their existence didn't matter. And so what I challenge people to do is to think about how we can give every single person a voice. Whether it is going on the street and being a direct activist and advocate for transgender rights or even starting in the home and teaching your children to be respectful of difference and for people to know that gender diversity is an okay thing. I want to end with a quote by Janet Mock. She is an author who just released a new book. And here she is pictured with my fiance. And she she's actually become a friend of the family's. And she did a speech the other day where she was thanking transgender women in the room. And she said, "They are the courageous ... the brave ones, the ones who have the audacity to be seen in a society that tells them that their existence does not matter." We need to make their existence matter. Thank you so much.

KEVIN NADAL I'm open to questions. I think we have a microphone if people want to ask questions. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Hi, thank you so much for that. I-, a comment leading into a question. I was fortunate enough to see Laverne Cox give the opening (inaudible ) talk at the National Lesbian and Gay Task Force Creating Change Conference in Houston just a couple of weeks ago. The talk is online if you Google Laverne Cox Creating Change. You can watch. It's a fantastic speech. I would really recommend people look into that. One of the things that she said there was that calling a transgender women a man is an act of violence. And so my question is you frame this in the context of microaggressions. But to me, subtle unconscious slights, that doesn't seem like this is what we're talking about. So I'm wondering if you can talk about that distinction between microaggressions and macroaggressions and kind of how to conceptualize really where is that distinction between micro and macro. 

00:48:00
KEVIN NADAL Right. Thank for that. I definitely agree that sometimes things aren't micro at all and that they're actually quite aggressive. In Derald Sue's initial article on racial microaggressions we described three different types of microaggressions, microinvalidations, microinsults and microassaults. Microassaults are the types of things that people say that might be clearly racist, homophobic, transphobic, etcetera. But that may be one people don't think is a bad thing to say, or two that people don't realize the impact that it has on people's lives. So for example people are conscious of saying things like that's so gay or making racist jokes or comedians make a lot of racist, sexist, homophobic jokes. They're aware of it but maybe they don't realize the impact that it has on people. Or two, they can come up with some rationalization as to why they're saying it. For transgender people I agree that it is much more obviously violent, extreme, overt, that they probably experience much more-, many more microassaults or generally assaults than I would as not only as a gay man but as a person of color. I don't go-, I don't hear people call me a Chink on an everyday basis. In fact, I haven't been called that in years. But for a transgender person perhaps that happens all the time. I think when we talk about microassaults versus assaults, I think that sometimes it's just semantics. That maybe we shouldn't classify it as microaggressions and maybe we should just start calling them aggressions. It could still potentially be considered a microaggression because of the inability for somebody to label it as transphobic or maybe not knowing what the intention of people are. So for example when somebody calls someone a shemale, perhaps that person really doesn't think that's a bad thing. As opposed to somebody who commits a hate crime and calls people transphobic language while they're doing that where that would be much more overt. So sometimes it might be considered a microassault and then sometimes it might just actually be a verbal assault. And I agree with you that I think we need to really pay attention to our language. I do agree with Laverne Cox. I've heard her say something similar to that. And I think that we need to realize how bad it is to do that. And I think she says that it's violence to convey that point. When Piers Morgan referred to Janet Mock as a man, I think he rationalized and he says but that's the truth. That's what you were. And she says, actually I was never a man, one, and two, I wasn't born a man. I was born a baby. And so I think what happens is that people become really defensive. He was a perfect example of what not to do when you commit a microaggression, which is to become defensive, to blame the recipient, to not take any responsibility, to not hear what the person had to say. And so I think that that's something that we need to do is teach people to be aware of language and to accept when we make mistakes and to apologize for them. Other questions?
