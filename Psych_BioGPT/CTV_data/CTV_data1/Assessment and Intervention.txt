Psychotropic Medications 

00:00:15
Assessment and Intervention 

00:00:20
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Throughout most of our history, mental illness has been regarded as evil and those who suffer from it have been met with fear often in prison like criminals. Even in the mid 19th century, when there was a move to establish facilities known as "Asylums," the treatment of the mentally ill was largely limited to physical restraints. It wasn't until the 1950s that the care of patients with mental illness began to change when an anesthesiologist searching for a different anesthetic agent first developed Chlorpromazine. While the drug was not a particularly good anesthetic, when it was given to individuals with schizophrenia, it had the ability to calm and even alleviate psychotic symptoms. In 1954, it was introduced under the trade name Thorazine, and the modern era of psychotropic medication was born. 

00:01:10
Role of Neurotransmitters 

00:01:15
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Before we can begin to discuss assessment and intervention, it is important to understand something about neurotransmitters, the substances that allowed nerve pathways to communicate information throughout the body. Neurotransmitters are the chemical switches of the nervous system. They allow neuralgic impulses to cross synapses, carrying the impulse to another nerve or muscle fiber or to a specific body structure. These chemicals are responsible for the movement of nerve impulses throughout the entire body. The interplay of neurotransmitters is complex and not fully understood. But we do know that in some individuals these chemical agents have become out of balance. And when these imbalances occur in neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and Serotonin, it can lead to mental difficulties. In many cases, medications can help to stabilize or restore this delicate balance and allow the individual to lead a more normal life. 

00:02:20
Assessment 

00:02:25
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Assessment can occur in both, an inpatient setting, for instance, in a hospital, and an outpatient setting, such as a psychiatrist office. And in both environments a range of behaviors should be taken into consideration. These include, restlessness and an inability to sit quietly, lack of expression or facial expressions that indicate emotions in appropriate to the situation. Consistent later arrivals or frequent absences. Lack of cooperation or a general inability to work with others. Impaired work productivity. Increased accidents or safety problems. Frequent complaints of fatigue or unexplained pains. Difficulty concentrating, making decisions or remembering things. Making excuses for missed appointments, deadlines or poor work. Decrease interest or involvement in one's work and relationships. Expressions of strange or grandiose ideas. Displays of anger or blaming of others. Weeping for no reason. But generally speaking patients who are mentally ill are in a state where they can no longer function normally in their environment. For instance, many somatic problems can arise in an individual suffering from an anxiety disorder. These can include, an upset stomach, headaches, rapid heart rate, and sweating. An individual with schizophrenia may hear voices, have delusions, or become paranoid and withdrawn. A person with manic depression may also have delusions and hear voices. They tend to become highly anxious and easily irritated. In addition, many symptoms of mental disorders overlap. For example anxiety symptoms are seen in over 96 percent of patients who suffer from depression. Sometimes behavioral clues are misinterpreted due to cultural differences. For example, while direct eye contact is valued in Western culture, in some cultures it is considered rude or challenging. There are also wide variations in what is considered normal behavior. Some people are very outgoing, others, shy or withdrawn and still others display both behaviors depending on the situation. An adolescent girl may be talkative with girlfriends but quiet and shy in the classroom. It is for reasons such as these that a presumptive diagnosis of mental distress or illness must be based on the presence of multiple indicators. In addition, many behaviors have wide ranges of normal and are therefore indicators of problems only when they either go to extremes or consistently occur when other behaviors would be more appropriate. Therefore, a diagnosis of mental illness also includes persistence, meaning most symptoms must be present for a prolonged period of time. However, some behaviors such as unprovoked anger or violence towards others are always considered abnormal. These need to be evaluated both as signs of mental health issues, and as potential indicators of a physical problem such as drug abuse, a medication side effect or a brain tumor. People with mental health issues often have physical ailments as well and may be admitted to the hospital or come into the clinic or emergency department seeking treatment for both. Depending on the type and severity of the disorder these patients may have problems describing their physical symptoms and later have difficulty in following a treatment plan. And patients with psychosis may have unwarranted fears or paranoid ideas that can interfere with both assessment and treatment. Knowledge of mental health and good observational skills are important for all health care workers. It is vital to know if a patient is taking psychotropic medications. Many of these drugs have known interactions with other medications, and it is also important that they not be abruptly discontinued. One of the most important skills and caring for patients with mental illness is the use of therapeutic communication techniques such as empathetic listening, and appropriate response to the patient's needs. In communicating with the patient use open ended questions, these seek broader responses than a simple yes or no, and can greatly enhance your understanding of the patient. Ask the patient specific questions about eating, socialization, sleeping, grooming, how he feels physically, and his treatment expectations. Effective assessment and care plans rely on a complete and accurate database. As the patients confidence in the caregiver develops so too does the database. It is also important to observe and document nonverbal gestures, body language and general physical appearance. and make sure to document any direct statements that might be significant. Some patients may be hesitant to disclose having a mental disorder. Taking time to listen and to establish report can help alleviate this reluctance. Mental illness may arise slowly, making it difficult for the patient, family, and friends to acknowledge that there is a problem. As the individual becomes aware of his or her mental illness the stages of loss may apply, beginning was shock, then moving to denial, anger, and grief before finally culminating in acceptance. 

00:08:15
Intervention 

00:08:20
SEAN W. HARRIGAN The need for intervention is most acute when the patient's behavior interferes with his day to day life or impacts the safety of the patient or others. There are a number of significant issues a health care professional must address as intervention commences. Is the person a danger to himself or others? Does the person want help? What are the intervention options? And what is the goal of intervention. Treatments for mental illness come under two categories: medications known as psychotropics which are chemical substances that have the ability to alter brain function and non-pharmaceutical intervention such as psychotherapy. However, most treatment plans utilize a combination of both medication and some form of psychotherapy.

Psychotropic Medication 

00:09:20
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Psychotropic medication is designed to do one of three things: block excesses of certain brain chemicals and hence the effectiveness of existing chemicals or mimic and improve upon the action of deficient chemicals. Medications or refer to either by their generic chemical name or their trade name. The trade or brand name is given by the company that manufactures the chemical. The original manufacturing company owns the patent and has exclusive rights to sell the drug for 24 years, after that others may market the drug under their own trade names. Though medication may have numerous trade names it has only one generic name. Psychotropic medications have side effects that can both jeopardize compliance and affect the health of the patient. Side effects may also resemble symptoms of the very disorder that is being treated. Failure to take this into consideration can result in the dose being increased when it needs to be decreased or even changed to another medication. Many psychiatric medications impact the cardiovascular system and can cause a drop in blood pressure, increasing the risk of a fall, particularly in the geriatric population. These patients must be cautioned and instructed to stand up slowly, stay well hydrated and avoid overheating. Most agents are metabolized by the liver and excreta primarily through the kidneys. Preexisting liver or kidney problems can impair metabolism and excretion causing toxic accumulation in the system. Routine lab tests maybe prescribe to monitor liver enzymes, blood components, electrolyte balance, kidney function and blood levels of medications. Psychotropic agents are effective only if they're taken, therefore a major factor of their success is compliance. Fears of addiction or the side effects of the medications as well as simple forgetfulness may jeopardize compliance. Educating the patient as well as their family and caregivers about the medication regimen is a critical part of administering their prescribed agents. The health care provider must continually assess whether the patient is complying with the medication regimen. Sudden withdrawal from psychotropic agents can have disastrous results. If the patient does not comply with the regimen the health care provider needs to communicate this to the primary physician or psychiatry's promptly. Psychotropic medications fall into several classifications based on their effects. These classifications include, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, mood stabilizers, and stimulants. We will see that the actions of these medications may overlap and that some have been found to be effective for more than one disorder. 

00:12:25
Antipsychotic Agents 

00:12:30
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Antipsychotic agents also refer to as neuroleptic agents are used to treat a number of psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. They fall into two classifications: Typical and Atypical. The typical agents are first generation and include such drugs as Heloperidol, Haldol, Thioridazine, Melleril. 

00:13:00

00:13:05
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Thiothixene, Navane, Pluphenaxine, Prolixin. 

00:13:15
[music] 

00:13:20
SEAN W. HARRIGAN And Chlorpromaxine, Thorazine. Well, about one third of individuals with mental illness are unresponsive to these first generation agents, for the majority of patients the agents are therapeutically effective. However, the side effects of first generation agents can be extremely troublesome and may lead to non-compliance. These include a muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, odd and repetitive movements, and diminish movement. Some of these movement disorders can become permanent if the patient continues on the drug. Other common side effects include, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and sexual dysfunction. The Atypical agents are second and third generation and include Aripiprazole, Abilify, Clozapine, Clozaril. 

00:14:20

00:14:40
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Quetiapine, SeroQUEL, and Olanzapine Zyprexa. Well, the side effects common with a typical agents are seen infrequently when it comes to the Atypical agents, it is now known that Atypical psychotropics have other significant side effects including an increased incidence of Type-2 diabetes. 

00:15:05
Antidepressant Agent 

00:15:10
[music] 

00:15:15
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Antidepressant agents are used to treat the symptoms of both acute and chronic depression. Antidepressants are categorized by their action and divided into several groups. Tricyclic, SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, SNRIs, Saratonen and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, And then MAOIs, Monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Tricyclics include Clomipramine, Anafranil. 

00:15:55

00:17:35
[music] 

00:17:40
SEAN W. HARRIGAN And Tranylcypromine, Parnate. These are used infrequently because they interact adversely with many foods and drugs making compliance more difficult. A fifth group of non-classified antidepressants includes Trazodone, Desyrel. 

00:18:00
[music] 

00:18:05
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Mirtazapine, Remeron, Nefazodone, Serzone, and Bupropion, Wellbutrin. 

00:18:20
[music] 

00:18:25
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Antidepressants have also been found to be effective for some patients with chronic pain. Although it is still not clear just how this works. Types of pain for which they are most effective include arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, tension headaches, migraines, fibromyalgia, low back pain and pelvic pain. Tricyclic, SSRIs and SNRis have been seen to be the most effective of the antidepressants. 

00:18:55
Anti-Obsessive Agent 

00:19:00
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Certain antidepressants have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of OCD. These include Clomipramine, Anafranil, Fluvoxamine, Luvox, Fluoxetine, Prozac, Paroxetine, Paxil, pekseva and Sertraline, Zoloft. These assistant controlling the symptoms of OCD. However, treatment is most effective when combined with psychotherapy. 

00:19:30
Anxiolytic(Antianxiety) Agent 

00:19:35
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Anxiolytic agents are used as sedatives and to reduce anxiety. Medications in Benzodiazepine group such as Diazepam, Valium are now less commonly used and even then only on a short term basis because they have a strong potential for dependence or abuse. There are several other high potency Anxiolytic medications effective in combating anxiety. They include Clonazepam, Klonopin, use for social phobia and GAD, Lorazepam, Ativan, use for panic disorder, and Alprazolam, Xanax, use for both panic disorder and GAD. They may cause drowsiness but this usually subsides after a few days. Dependency can also arise when these medications are used, so they are usually only taken for short periods of time. However, in the case of patients with panic disorder the medications can be taken for up to a year with no or minimal adverse side effects. Beta blockers such as Propranolol, Inderol can be helpful in controlling the physical symptoms of some anxiety disorders, particularly social phobia. SSRIs, tricyclics and MAOIS are also used to treat the symptoms of anxiety. 

00:21:05
Mood Stabilizer 

00:21:10
SEAN W. HARRIGAN A number of medications will assist in stabilizing the mood swings that accompany bipolar disorder. Some such as lithium are more effective at controlling mania. While others including Lamotrigine ae better at reducing depression. Patients with bipolar disorder are commonly treated with Lithium and a secondary drug, either an antipsychotic or the anticonvulsant Divalproex Sodium, Depakote. Antipsychotics use include Aripiprazole, Abilify, Ziprasidone, Geodon, Asenapine, Saphris, Quetiapine, SeroQUEL, and Olanzapine, Zyprexa. 

00:21:50
Stimulants 

00:21:55
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Stimulant medications are used to treat disorders such as ADHD and narcolepsy. And occasionally can also be used for depression when other medications are found to be ineffective. Common stimulant medications include Methampheidate, Ritalin. 

00:22:10
[music] 

00:22:15
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Adderall, a proprietary blend of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, and Dexedrine, dextroamphetamine. More recently non-stimulant medications are coming into use for ADHD. Two drugs have been FDA approved for this purpose, Atomoxetine, Strattera, which is classified as an NSRI, Norepinephrine Selective Reuptake Inhibitor, and Guanfacine, Tenex, Intuniv, classified as an anti-hypertensive. However, other medications not specifically approved are being used in the same way. The Atypical anti-depressant Bupropion is the most commonly used off label, non-stimulant medication for treatment of ADHD. 

00:23:15
Non-Pharmaceutical Modalities 

00:23:20
SEAN W. HARRIGAN A variety of interactive therapies are also utilized for the treatment of mental health disorders. The most commonly used are categorized as psychosocial treatments. These include various types of psychotherapy as well as social and vocational training. 

00:23:40
Individual Psychotherapy 

00:23:45
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Individual psychotherapy requires regularly scheduled sessions with a mental health professional. The goal is to assist patients in understanding the causes of their behaviors and develop techniques for controlling them. Patients receiving psychotherapy may also be placed on psychotropic medications. Disorders for which individual psychotherapy is used successfully include schizophrenia, ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and eating disorders. Psychotherapy take several forms. Interpersonal therapy focuses on improving relationship skills including reducing self-isolation and difficulties in getting along with or understanding others. Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to determine the links between the thoughts and emotions that lead to destructive behaviors. Once this has been accomplished, the mental health professional helps the individual to recognize and self regulate negative thought patterns. Replacing them with positive thoughts in order to avoid these behaviors in the future. This can help for anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, eating disorders, ADHD, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, OCD and substance abuse. Exposure therapy is used for both OCD and PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In this form of therapy the individual is exposed to situations that stimulate the traumatic experience which trigger the behaviors. This can help desensitized the individual to the trigger. Patients are also taught techniques to avoid performing compulsive rituals or to help work through the trauma. Medications may also be helpful for patients with severe symptoms. Dialectical Behavior Therapy is used to treat a variety of disorders, particularly those related to borderline personality disorder and including the chronically suicidal. It is also helpful for patients with substance dependence, binge eating and severe depression. It combines various strategies from behavior therapy and can decrease both the frequency and severity of self-destructive behaviors. 

00:26:05
Psychoeducation 

00:26:10
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Psycho education focuses on educating individuals about their illness. Treatment often takes the form of family counseling sessions. Part of the goal is helping both patients and families to recognize the symptoms of a relapse or the side effects of a medication. Involving the family may reduce their distress, confusion and anxiety about the affected individual. And can also help to nurture a more supportive environment. Psychoeducation is commonly combined with medication and can be beneficial with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. 

00:26:50
Self-Help and Support Groups 

00:26:55
[music] 

00:27:00
SEAN W. HARRIGAN Often individuals find that self-help and support groups provide effective therapy as well. Facilitators are not usually professional therapists but have expertise in group dynamics. And are able to assist the individual group members in sharing as well as providing support for one another. Support groups are also available for family members, helping them cope with the issues of living with someone who suffers from a mental disorder. Good care requires complete assessment of the patient, familiarity with the markers of his or her illness and knowledge of the range of treatments available. As the patient's response to medication is monitored by watching lab values and checking for symptoms of side effects it is important to also listen to the verbal and nonverbal messages of the patient. This assessment helps to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.
