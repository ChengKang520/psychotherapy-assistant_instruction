A Conversation with 

00:00:05
Gender Non-Conforming 

00:00:05
Gender Non-Binary Youth 

00:00:05
with Julie Tilsen, PhD 

00:00:05
Julie Tilsen, Ph.D. 

00:00:10
JULIE TILSEN Hi, I'm Julie Tilsen. I'm the author of therapeutic conversations with queer youth and the forthcoming title narrative approaches to youth work which will be out in 2018, published by Routledge. I have the opportunity to sit down with Em (ph) and Isa who are umm… two gender non-binary young people, who were generous enough to have a conversation with me in which they shared their experiences and their knowledge uh… about what it's like, to be a young gender non-binary person of color umm… in the world and umm… I'm hoping that you'll find the things that they have to say very useful for you as you move forward in your work supporting young people. 

00:01:00
How to position oneself with clients 

00:01:05
JULIE TILSEN I'd like, to make some suggestions about what you might pay attention to, just some things to help you orient your viewing compass as you move forward. First, I'd like, to talk about umm… how I position myself with these two young people? Positioning is a, is a sort of fancy way of talking about how you show up to the conversation or the relationships that you're engaging in umm… it has to do with the stance you take, umm… the voice you use, for example, are you going to show up as an expert, or you going to show up as a collaborator, are you going to show up umm… as someone with a lot of curiosity or a lot of certainty, umm… as some examples. And what's important to think about in terms of positioning is, how we position ourselves has everything to do with how someone else gets to be positioned. It's about the relational space that we're creating together with the people we're engaging with. So in this conversation with Isa and Em, umm… I'm trying to position myself as someone who is curious and interested in centering their knowledge's and their experiences, umm… some might call it a more anthropological approach uh… in the sense that I am a guest in their worlds, umm… and I'm interested in learning not about them in a way that I'm looking at them as things to learn about and study, but to learn from them and be transformed or, or touched by what they have to share. 

00:02:45
Being self-reflexive 

00:02:50
JULIE TILSEN The second thing I'd invite you to pay attention to which is related to umm… noticing positioning is being self reflexive. Umm… Again rather than focusing on the other in this case these two young people, or even me in the video I'd invite you to pay attention to what is being evoked or provoked in you? What feelings and reactions are coming up? What assumptions? Trace those reactions that you're having back to assumptions that maybe are being challenged or even exploded in this conversation. Umm… and to use your, this opportunity to reflect on that to consider if you were to show up with the, the ref-, the assumptions that are emerging for you in what way might that prevent you from engaging uh… fully with, with anybody who you're interested in talking with. 

00:03:50
Centrality of community 

00:03:55
JULIE TILSEN The next thing I'd invite you to think about it or attend to here has to do with some of the stuff of the conversation. Umm… one of the themes that emerges throughout a conversation, Em and Isa, kind of start there and visited different paths during this conversation and we end there, is the centrality of community. And they're talking about how important community is to them. Whether it's an online community or IRL, in real life community and I think what's really important to listen to is to hear community as belonging. Umm… one of the greatest challenges that gender non-binary folks experience and particularly young people is a disbelonging from the places we would assume young people are supposed to have community. Their family, their schools umm… other youth centered social places and transgender and gender non-binary and gender queer folks and young people have to find community in other places uh… in order to experience belonging and to be become visible and have, have literal safety, physical, spiritual, emotional safety in their life. So, I would pay attention to their conversation about community. 

00:05:25
Intersectionality 

00:05:30
JULIE TILSEN Another thing that Isa and Em bring up in that we have conversation about uh… is umm… intersectionality which is a feminist theory term that basically has to do with making sure we're attending to all the different identities that people have in the world and also what happens when those intersect. So for example, it could be easy in a conversation about transgender and gender nonconforming, gender binary young people to focus on gender which is super important, but uh… we also have to consider their lives as youth, as youth of color. Umm… and not only considering those like, we're parsing each of those out, out but how is it different to be trans or non-binary youth of color as opposed to being a white non-binary umm… gender queer young person. And so that's something that they, they have a uh… pretty nuanced conversation about and I think it's really important for us to consider. 

00:06:35
Centrality of language 

00:06:40
JULIE TILSEN Uh… the last thing that I would say umm… might be important to attend to is the centrality of language. Umm… It's easy to want to get caught up in, in the words uh… the terms transgender, Cisgender, gender nonconforming, gender non-binary, but I'm talking about the centrality of language I don't mean literal words, I mean language as the way we engage with, with others. Language is all social practices it's what makes belonging or disbelonging possible and it's what makes people visible and umm… legitimate to others. And so, I would pay close attention to how language is has been central to Isa and Em and their ability to be seen, be seen on their terms and to be able to as I say speak themselves into the world. So, as you head into watching this video umm… I'm thinking of something we often say to ourselves, you know, any of us who work with young people umm… as therapists, as youth workers, we say may meet them where they're at. And I think that what I would invite people to think about is sometimes what's implicit in that saying meet them where they're at is we're going to meet them where they're at, because then maybe we need to take them somewhere else, I'd really invite you to sit down, listen to Isa and Em, meet them where they're at and imagine being okay staying there that they're inviting you as hosts into their world where you get to be a guest, and that it can be an okay place to be. 

00:08:35
The conversation 

00:08:40
JULIE TILSEN Em, Isa, thank you so much for joining me tonight in this conversation. Umm… I'm wondering if you two would be willing just to, introduce yourselves and umm… to say your pronouns and your identities. Umm… I'm Julie, I'm cisgender, I use she and her. 

00:09:00
EM Umm… Hi, I'm Em, I use they, them pronouns, and she, her pronouns. I identify as non-binary gender nonconforming. Umm… I have like, a few labels that I, I like, to use, I also identify it's trans feminine. It's not really like, uh… like, not a lot of people know what that is but just like, I'm trans feminine. I know that's it. 

00:09:20
ISA Umm… Hi, I'm Isa. I uh… my pronouns are she, her or they, them. Umm… I identified as a gender queer but trans fem aligned umm… because of going through the experiences of trans women. 

00:09:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, all right. And one of the things I'm curious about before we kind of jump into this conversation is I'm wondering what about participating in this and making this film which is this video is going to be a resource for therapists, counselors, teachers people who want to work in support of trans and gender queer, gender non-confirming folks. What about participating in this project appealed to you and what would you hope might come from, from this resource? What would you like, people to do with it? 

00:10:15
ISA Umm… I think something that appeal to me, being offered to work on this project is uh… getting more communication and understanding out there because there isn't, there isn't a lot to go off of right now. Umm… and something that I hope people will take away from this is ah… a whole new meaning to their own trans advocacy. 

00:10:45
JULIE TILSEN Cool. 

00:10:45
EM Yeah, definitely I agree with what he just said. Yeah, but umm… same here if I could give umm… anyone like, an insight or like, a perspective that could help people understand trans identities more then I'm gladly would like, volunteer. 

00:11:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, you know, as the two of you, two of you speak to that, it makes you wonder have there been particular experiences with people who were like, supposed to show up in support of you or in service of you somewhere where it was like, that is not working, it's like, did have there been some experiences like that that you're thinking of? 

00:11:25
EM Definitely. 

00:11:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:11:25
EM I feel it's like, a constant process. Umm… like, if you want to touch on it, I can… 

00:11:35
ISA If , if you want to continue to respond… 

00:11:35
JULIE TILSEN So much politeness, yeah, say some more about that I mean whatever you're comfortable with in terms of, you know, what kinds of experiences have you had with counselors or therapists or teachers or someone who was supposed to be umm… ser-, you know, working for you or serving you in some way where there was something not right or something missing or something even harmful or violent in their service. 

00:12:00
EM Definitely. Umm… I don't feel comfortable I, like, seeing like, like, male therapists. I don't know, well, not male therapists but just seeing people who don't like, I feel like, it's often its like straight men who don't understand like, or don't care to take the initiative to understand me and I've had therapists who have gone to and seen because I've been assigned by my doctor and umm… I'd like, don't come back to see them again. And it's just like, umm… this entire process of scheduling to see a therapist or see a professional and then like, seeing them and seeing that like, these people can't completely like, don't even care to like, ask a single thing about like, myself and just assume all these things and like, immediately make me feel unsafe like, umm… I have like, like, I know people don't will assume like, I'm like, a guy or a man or whatever and then like, like, umm… like, just to like, I'm down to come out to people you know what I mean and come out to therapists and have them like, understand like, umm…who I am and where I'm coming from, but like, I feel like, if I get a signal that people are like, not going to be perceptive to that I'm not going to open up to them. 

00:13:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:13:15
ISA Umm…Touching base on what you said about uh… like, guidance, counselors, and therapists not taking like, initiative to understand you umm… that I feel and like, not being comfortable around those people. I feel the same uh… or, I can relate, because umm…I don't feel comfortable speaking to people who are in real positions of power in society like, so… therapists, or doctors, or even police, because I know that umm… like, discrimination is there and also like, if it's not discrimination on trans-ness, it's based on race and other intersections between uh… my own queer trans-ness and whatever another part of my life. 

00:14:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so, so, it sounds like, both of you would have had experiences where either there is sort of like, Em, there's an absence of a curiosity or interest or, or effort to get to know you on your terms. It's like, it's like, you're not seen… 

00:14:25
EM Yeah. 

00:14:25
JULIE TILSEN …or there is the presence of some real active stuff like, some racism, umm… and transphobia or in hetero-homo-normative kind of stuff, right? And, and so when, what that has me wondering is, given those experiences umm… what is it taking for you guys to be willing to participate in this conversation? Umm… because it sounds like that would engender a lot of caution and reservation what does it take for you to show up to a conversation like this? 

00:15:00
EM Like, specifically this conversation? 

00:15:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, this one right here with me, you know, I just walk down, I'm from, you know, from 1500 miles away, no 3000 miles away, you know. 

00:15:10
EM Yeah, I feel like, my entire like, atmosphere of like, umm… social connections like, everyone I know personally is like, I know from like, a friend of a friend or like, a person of a person so it completely like, like, the people I open up to are people who I know, or know who knows. So I don't open up to strangers… 

00:15:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:15:25
EM …like, completely like… 

00:15:30
JULIE TILSEN So you're like, borrowing out a relationship you have in, you know, it makes you wonder that how central is community and being connected through umm… gender queer trans community to you and making decisions about what you're going to say to whoever even if they are professional. Is that something that, that fits for you two? 

00:15:55
EM Yeah. 

00:15:55
JULIE TILSEN Centrality of community, you know, having that connection… 

00:15:55
EM No, community is everything. 

00:15:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. 

00:16:00
ISA Community is uh… almost my whole life revolves around it. And umm… finding acceptance like, within myself and also through the community, uh… is a huge, huge like, factor of like, who I am and why I'm able to come and have this conversation. 

00:16:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and one of the things that in terms of community umm… I'm wondering does it feel like, some of the stuff that, that you're wanting to explain to people is umm… how do I want to say it, is like, you're always having to go out into the world to find some of these things there's not enough of the things that you need or support or services that you need that are centered in community. Does that make sense? 

00:16:55
ISA Umm… I feel kind of yes and no. 

00:17:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:17:00
ISA As an uh… the whole world coming in to me and providing you resources is something that sounds ideal. But at the same time, uh… not having me be the teacher like, trans folks be the teacher of what umm… We as a community need to survive. 

00:17:25
JULIE TILSEN Umm… let me throw this question out. What is gender and what do you want and in, in particular, what is gender when we're talking about non-binary, gender non-conforming, gender queer? What do you need people to get about how gender is understood and how people live gender from a non-binary, non-conforming gender queer place? 

00:18:00
EM I can answer this one umm… gender is definitely something that's always like, on my mind or not just because it's like, something like, I really like, care of so much about. I mean I care a lot about gender and umm… perceptions of me and like, my identity a lot, but I feel like, most of the time I care about it because umm… other people care about it so much. And umm… it's like, a big thing, you know what I mean umm… 

00:18:25
JULIE TILSEN And what are some of the ways that you notice other people caring a lot about gender? 

00:18:30
EM Well, I, I think like, gender is fake and like, and I think having said that like, umm… like, I don't think like, gender is a real concept I think umm… it's like, something pushed on everyone and like, the roles of gender are pushed on all of us and I think identity is completely different thing, I think identity is something that we've created for ourselves and something I'm, I'm constantly creating for myself, and I think I identify as gender nonconforming, identify as non-binary, because that's how I choose to identify and it umm… helps me like, umm… find community with other people who feel the same way who feel like, isolated from like, not identifying as like, a man or woman living in this space between these two like, like, mainstream gender roles… 

00:19:15
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:19:20
EM …and umm… just my identity helps me like, navigate this world a lot easier. 

00:19:25
ISA Umm… bouncing off of that of gender's fake, and a social construct… which I believe uh… very strongly also umm… even though it is fake, and a concept made up by people as a means to categorize umm… other people, it's still something that's there and uh… that we ca--and I say we, but I mean me-- or I… that I can't get away from in the sense of no matter where I go there is going to be documents to fill out that say male or female. Umm… there's going to be restrooms that are male or female and like, once in a while you have a family restroom or all genders bathroom. 

00:20:10
EM Yeah, it's tough, you can't escape, really… 

00:20:10
ISA Yeah. 

00:20:15
JULIE TILSEN So it's, it's fake it's a, it's a construct, it's these things like you said these roles people get put into umm… but there's "there" there, even though it's fake. 

00:20:30
EM Yeah, yeah, no, I understand that. 

00:20:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, you know, it's so I'm just sort of reflecting back what you said. Umm… what are the effects on each of you and then um maybe some of the other umm… gender nonconforming, gender non-binary folks that you know, of the "there-ness" of gender that is so there. What, what was something effects of that? What are some of the like, things that it does to you or the tolls it takes or efforts it makes you have to make in the world? 

00:21:00
EM I didn't really understand what you're asking. I'm sorry. 

00:21:00
JULIE TILSEN Okay, so, when like, Isa said, it's so there… 

00:21:05
EM Yeah. 

00:21:05
JULIE TILSEN Because gender is so there and like you said you care so much about it because other people care so much about it. 

00:21:10
EM Yeah. 

00:21:15
JULIE TILSEN What effects does that have on you? 

00:21:20
ISA I know, for me uh… one effect of gender like, being there and being umm… applied to my everyday life is, I get held to standards that I don't think any person, any person should be held to, umm… such as like, the idea of toxic masculinity and having to be uh… if you present masculine then you have to be a man and you have to be everything that comes with that. So that being like, you have to be the one that does hard labor and you have to be the one you can go and get, you know, a job and provide and you know take care of the family or whatever because… 

00:21:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:22:00
ISA …that's put on you like, as a man… 

00:22:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:22:00
ISA …umm… 

00:22:05
JULIE TILSEN So some of the thereness in gender is around roles assumptions, expectations, stuff like that? 

00:22:10
ISA Uh-huh. 

00:22:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. Is, is this is making some more sense my question now, or is it still… 

00:22:20
ISA I'm kind of processing it. 

00:22:20
JULIE TILSEN You're processing it, okay, cool. Umm… you know, so when we're talking about uh… these ideas of gender non-conforming, gender non-binary umm… where, who are some of the people that you experience some of those, you know, people caring a lot and, and what-- are there ways that when they're caring or that gender is so there umm… that it makes it hard for you to show up in ways that you prefer? 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:00
ISA I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question? 

00:23:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, other ways that umm… it's hard to show up in the ways you want to in your gendering ways, umm… because of how other people impose those expectations and the way they think about gender. 

00:23:20
EM I guess like, um, like, understanding that like, gender is performative, I can't really like, like, like, express myself because of like, constantly thinking about other people's like, opinions and stuff. So I'm just like, I don't know as much as I want to just like, just chill and do my own thing and like, dress how I want to dress and like, like, act how I want to act, like, I'm constantly having to like, navigate other people's perceptions of me and like, how I'm presenting myself. Like, it's not just how do you want to present yourself it's how do you want to present myself and how my going to like, navigate safety as well and… 

00:24:00
JULIE TELSIN Yeah, yeah. So when you talk about other people that, um, is it like, you're presenting yourself and there's meaning that you make of that? But you don't have any control over the meaning others are making… 

00:24:10
EM Definitely not. 

00:24:15
JULIE TELSIN Is, is that kind of what you're speaking to? 

00:24:15
EM Yeah. 

00:24:15
JULIE TELSIN Yeah, okay, and is that then where like, those assumptions and those assignments of roles come in, because people will look and being assuming certain things. 

00:24:30
ISA Anytime gender is involved and he forced upon somebody I feel that there are those roles that follow with it. 

00:24:35
JULIE TELSIN Yeah. 

00:24:40
ISA So umm… if you were born uh… assigned female at birth umm… then you're seen for the rest of your life as submissive and uh… the care giver and all of these things, compare to being assigning male at birth and having to be aggressive… 

00:24:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:25:00
ISA …and outgoing and the breadwinner. 

00:25:05
JULIE TILSEN What do you think would happened if different roles and different characteristics weren't coded as one or the other? What would that make possible for people? 

00:25:20
EM That'd just like, I feel like, like, once, like, gender like, roles aren't like, on us, I feel like, liberation is a lot more closer to us. I generally feel like, if we weren't like, limited to like, like, Like, I feel like, like, everyone regardless of like, how you identify regardless of like, how you view trans people everyone's like, limited by this like, gender binary and like affected by this like, construct, this like, European construct honestly. And umm…I think if it like, weren't like, as heavily present as it is in like, our like, society right now then I feel like, we'd be like, just like, more honest to ourselves and more free, just like, chill. 

00:26:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. You know, so I'm thinking about some of what you both were saying earlier and you're talking about everybody else care so much about it, and there's so much "there" there, and yet who ends up kind of suffering and carrying the load for these constructs, you know, the gender binary you talk about that, you know, how people have to fall into categories male or female, that's just attached to anatomy which is identified by the all powerful… 

00:26:35
EM Yeah. 

00:26:35
JULIE TILSEN …birthing physician, right? 

00:26:35
EM Yeah. 

00:26:40
JULIE TILSEN And so um… is it transgender and gender non-conforming, gender non-binary people that end up bearing the load of all that? 

00:26:50
EM You're asking like, who's suffering from the… 

00:26:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:26:50
EM …gender binary? Well, I honestly like, can definitely one hundred percent say that trans women have it the hardest and I think that's like um something everyone needs to understand, I think there's a quote that's said like, "Once the black woman, black trans woman is liberated, then we will all be liberated." And I think, umm… everything like, up from there is like, all like, a go. I think umm… the reason why like, trans women are so like, umm… like, uh… what's the word, like umm… vulnerable community is, because misogyny and like, like, everyone like, in this society like, hates women and umm… I think anything like, trying to ascribe to femininity is also vulnerable. 

00:27:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and then you also mentioned the intersection of race so there's an intersection of misogyny and white supremacy. 

00:27:40
EM Definitely, definitely. Racism and colorism definitely like, intersect with umm… with trans identities like, really have, you know, and I think umm… people in the society like, aren't like, um, familiar with trans identities and people in the society have been umm… like, taught to like, hate darker skin. And I feel like, when dark skin meets like, uh… something people aren't familiar with it's just creates violence unfairly. 

00:28:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so did you- is there anything I'm saying that you want to respond to or anything else you wanted to say about that? 

00:28:20
ISA Umm… I'm okay right now. 

00:28:25
JULIE TILSEN Okay, yeah. So, I was just, you know, asking about umm… as you guys are pointing out the gender binary and you know, as saying that it's asking about who, who sort of suffers who, who, who, who carries the load around that and Em was saying particularly trans women, trans women color. Umm… and what I'm wondering is, is that do you guys think it's fair to say that people, individual people gender non-confirming and trans people suffer in this sort of privatized way, but it's really a social issue? 

00:29:05
EM Definitely. 

00:29:10
JULIE TILSEN So, it's this privatization of a social problem? 

00:29:10
EM Yeah. 

00:29:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, I'm, I'm wondering when you think about that as umm… gender non-binary, non-confirming people umm… what would be some of your suggestions to de-privatize this burden, that's placed on individual gender queer folks? And so that it's more uh… handled in the social world, what suggestions would you have for people who are wanting to be in service of trans and gender queer communities who want to be allies, what, what needs to happen so that this privatization doesn't continue? 

00:29:55
EM I think umm… sorry. 

00:29:55
ISA Oh, no, it's okay. 

00:30:00
EM I think like, umm… like, I'm a part of a vulnerable community that needs help. And I think that's very obvious and I think umm… if people were interested in like, helping me which I think everyone should be, you know what I mean, I think uh… like, just educate like, yourself and maybe the people around you and I think that's just like, a big step educating yourself as to like, what pronouns are and how to respect them and like, like I said I like to use like, they them pronouns and be referred to by she her pronouns, so if people were to like, if cis gendered folks were to start like, introducing themselves like, hi, my name is so and so. I use he him pronouns. I feel like, if I were introduced like, that by like, as a stranger I'd feel like, immediately like, this access intimacy where I feel immediately comfortable around them. 

00:30:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so can I, can I, can zero in on that… 

00:30:50
EM Yeah. 

00:30:50
JULIE TILSEN …for a moment and then… 

00:30:55
EM Yeah, go ahead. 

00:30:55
JULIE TILSEN …you guys can get some other, so that's a real specific thing and often the burden is on umm… gender queer folks, it's like, we're the ones with the weird pronouns and you can't figure out who I am so I've say my pronouns. You're saying is flip that and if, if all us cis folks would go around, taking that and introducing ourselves with our pronouns… 

00:31:20
EM Yeah. 

00:31:20
JULIE TILSEN …it flips that burden? 

00:31:25
EM Definitely, I can't, I mean, I can't speak for everyone, but I can like, guarantee you like, like, all trans people would feel safer and like, you know, like, I just like, a fact like, people would feel safer if someone were to take the initiative to make someone feel comfortable. And I think that's just not just for being trans, you know what I mean, like, if you go around and show like, I'm an ally to your community but not like, in a weird, like, pretentiously way, you know, like, in an honest… 

00:31:50
JULIE TILSEN No cookies for allies… 

00:31:55
EM Literally like, in a way that's like, like, hi, like, how can I support you, you know? 

00:32:00
JULIE TILSEN So ask, so those really specific things. Use pronouns and ask. 

00:32:05
EM Yeah. I'm, I mean personally I'm not, I'm not offended by questions, you know, I mean, I mean I definitely understand some people are, but I mean, it wouldn't hurt to ask. 

00:32:15
JULIE TILSEN Isa, what are your thoughts you know going back to the question was, how we de-privatized this burden? What are some things specific or general conception, conceptual ideas you have around, how to put, put the responsibility for accounting back in a social context? 

00:32:35
ISA Umm… I feel within the queer community, uh… the LGBT community, umm… lifting up trans people of color and seriously uh… interviewing and taking into account all the experience that they have to offer umm… which is something that doesn't happen a lot uh… in San Diego. Umm… and another thing of… accountability for people who aren't trans and don't have our experience is uh… owning up to that ally-ship you claim to have. Umm… anybody can wear a pin and say that we love trans folks but what are you going to do whenever a homeless trans youth comes up to your door and says that they need a place to sleep for the night and you turn them away, uh… that's not ally-ship, that's wanting attention. 

00:33:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, okay. So… 

00:33:40
EM I wanted to say something. 

00:33:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:33:40
EM I think like, umm… if someone wanted to like, uh… if someone wanted to like, like, be supportive and they wanted to know more on like, how to be supportive they could just ask me, you know what I mean like, I feel like, it's definitely like, umm… the opportunity's there and like, umm… yeah, I feel like, there's like, a learning growing process for everyone especially if people are unfamiliar with these like, identities and stuff and umm… like, I, I mean and like, I know like, lots of other people are down to like, have these conversations and be present. 

00:34:20
JULIE TILSEN You know what I wonder when you say you're down for the conversations, I almost wonder, are you hungry for them? Do you know what I mean? 

00:34:25
EM No, yeah. 

00:34:25
JULIE TILSEN It, really, really desiring people to show up and, and ask you umm… you know, to help me understand and, and don't I don't want to learn about you; I learn from you. 

00:34:40
EM Yeah. 

00:34:45
ISA I feel like that uh, kinda goes back to like the reason that I personally wanted be a part of this project is like, uh… getting more understanding out there without having to go and do a one on one with every person. 

00:35:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, can we do this, can we talk a little bit about language? 

00:35:05
EM Yeah. 

00:35:10
JULIE TILSEN Is that okay or am I like, jumping into something, are you guys kind of on a roll or have some lingering thoughts that you wanted to… 

00:35:15
EM No, we can jump into language. 

00:35:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, cool. All right, so… like, if we were going to make a set of flash cards for people… 

00:35:20
EM Yeah. 

00:35:20
JULIE TILSEN …get them all caught up on this. Okay, what's like, trans gender, what would you say? 

00:35:30
EM Umm… not cisgender. 

00:35:35
JULIE TILSEN Not cisgender. 

00:35:35
EM So, trans gender would be umm… 

00:35:40
JULIE TILSEN It's not a test. No, no, no pressure… 

00:35:40
EM No, okay, yeah, I'm honestly, it sounds like a test. No, I'm joking, but uh transgender is anything that umm… is, is a individual who doesn't identify with the gender they're assigned at birth. So, if you're assigned male at birth and that's not what you identify with, you can umm… identify as transgender if you wanted to, if you dared. 

00:36:00
JULIE TILSEN If you dared? 

00:36:05
ISA Umm… If I was going to add like a synonym to that flash card it would be non-cis-ness. 

00:36:10
JULIE TILSEN So I better go what cisgender I… when we sat down and did introductions… 

00:36:10
EM Yeah. 

00:36:15
JULIE TILSEN I introduced myself as cisgender. 

00:36:15
EM Cisgender is if you identify with the gender you're assigned at birth. 

00:36:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Geneder non-confirming, what would you guys say about that? 

00:36:30
ISA Umm… I would put gender nonconforming as either living between the gender binary or outside of it altogether umm… in the sense of uh… you don't identify with male or female umm… and uh… even having like, lack of a gender. 

00:36:50
JULIE TILSEN Could be, yeah. 

00:36:50
EML Yeah, I think all these terms after outside of transgender are like, really the more umbrella-esque, I feel like, if someone claims they get an identity as like, for themselves specifically, I think that's completely valid, but I also think that umm… these labels are created so that people can make like, loosely fit into them, you know… 

00:37:10
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:15
EM And like, I mean and when I see people I mean people who don't identify as the gender they're assigned at birth. 

00:37:15
JULIE TILSEN Right, right. 

00:37:20
EM So whether that's trans guys like, trans girls… 

00:37:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:37:20
EM …non-binary folks. 

00:37:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, and, and so there's all these different terms and language and I'm wondering, you know, each of your experience, how, how did you come into the, the language that helps you like, speak yourselves into being? How did you find the words and the languaging that, that suits you? 

00:37:40
EM I feel like, online and definitely like, like… 

00:37:40
JULIE TILSEN Tumblr, YouTube… 

00:37:45
EM Yeah, I know like, I feel like, I'm a, I feel like, I'm a part of a generation that grew up online and like, umm… having access to like, large communities at like, immediate like, a pace as the Internet is and I feel like, I have access to like, I have like, an access to like, like, older queers and older trans people that like, generations before me didn't have, and I feel like, umm… they're passing down this language like, our like, our older generation and umm… 

00:38:10
JULIE TILSEN Wow. 

00:38:10
EM Yeah. 

00:38:15
JULIE TILSEN So that you, you see that you're part of something larger… 

00:38:15
EM Yeah 

00:38:20
JULIE TILSEN …and longer, part of, okay, yeah. So online resources? 

00:38:20
EM Yeah, and I think, these, these labels aren't like, a new thing, you don't mean? Like I said, they're passed down and like, also like, umm… like, transgender, cisgender, like, gender non-conforming like, these are just like, just like, English, you know what I mean? And like, like, cultures all over the world have these words and stuff that translate into their languages, then like, our ancestors like, my ancestors specifically had like, words for these, you know, I'm unfortunately I don't know them because of colonialism and stuff but umm… yeah, my ancestors had the, the words for what I'm feeling. 

00:39:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, in terms of your identity how, how gender fits for you, yeah, yeah. 

00:39:00
EM Yeah. 

00:39:05
JULIE TILSEN Okay, and umm… Isa, were gonna say, say something about I was asking like, how did you come into the language? And how did you find the language that, that helps you speak yourself into the world? 

00:39:20
ISA Umm… I feel very much that having a sense of community, uh… physical community not so much online for myself. Umm… and seeing radical trans people, non-binary folks, agender folks. Umm… and getting to experience, my own life and my own orientation with them really, really umm… broadened my horizons in a sense of like, uh… exposed me to stuff that wasn't just binary, that was the stuff was totally umm… outside to it. 

00:40:00
JULIE TILSEN You know, I get… I start wondering when you, as you two think about, whether online, IRL, whereever, you know, you started finding possibilities, and finding like, language possibilities, was it like, you--language and words that suited you found you and kind of lined up with experience you were having, or were you having these experiences umm… and you didn't need the language? It's just always interesting for me to know what it was like, when you started finding ways to talk and, and share your experiences with others. 

00:40:40
EM Yeah. 

00:40:45
JULIE TILSEN How does, how does that fit for either of you? 

00:40:45
EM Umm… I feel like, I started identifying as umm… non-binary when I met like, non-binary individuals themselves. And I was like, oh, shit, like, that's like, like, that's exactly like me, you know what I mean… 

00:40:55
JULIE TILSEN So like, made it possible for you… 

00:41:00
EM Yeah. 

00:41:00
JULIE TILSEN …when you met others and before you had heard the term non-binary, what was it like, before you had the language? 

00:41:05
EM It's really weird, I don't know like, it was really uncomfortable like, having these feelings that I couldn't ascribe a term to and like, you know no one's teaching me these words, my school isn't teaching me these words umm… my mom's not teaching me these words, you know, so and when I'm having these feelings and I finally encounter them for- at last, you know what I mean, it's like, really like, umm… a breath of relief. 

00:41:30
JULIE TILSEN So you know, I was asking about what it was like, when you found some language to describe your experience and you're saying like, you know, no one's teaching me these words, it was a relief from that. 

00:41:40
EM Yeah, I feel like, umm… not only relief, but overwhelming. I feel like, when I run… when I ran into like, what I consider community now I feel like, it happened at once. And I feel like, I met one person who knew like a thousand people and like, just being introduced into this like, whole entire world of like, safety what I, what I consider safety, but I consider that people understanding and caring enough to like, be understanding of who I am, it's really like, like, safe haven and kind of type shit. 

00:42:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:42:15
EM Yeah. 

00:42:15
JULIE TILSEN Isa, do you have any thoughts or stories about what it was like, to come into some, some language and to, to, you know, words that help you speak your experience? 

00:42:30
ISA Umm… uh, growing up, I was… er, I always identified as um… a drag queen. Just because I felt that was the only way that it was okay to be both, umm… masculine and feminine at the same time and like, also me there at the same time umm… and it wasn't until I started getting more involved with the like )the Hillcrest youth project and community organizing and going to events, umm… that I finally found the language that wasn't umm… promoting cisness in myself… 

00:43:20
JULIE TILSEN Uh-huh. 

00:43:20
ISA …umm… 

00:43:25
JULIE TILSEN What was it like when you found that language? 

00:43:30
ISA It was very, I don't know, enlightening almost in the sense of umm… maybe I'm not just some stereotypical gay boy in a wig; maybe I'm so much more than that and there are other people that are so much more than that, that have my same experience. 

00:43:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, it almost sounds like you were trying to find a way to live in to the language that was available to you, and that didn't feel right and then you found some language that matched your experience and, and, what did that make possible for you when you found out that you're not a gay boy with a wig and didn't have to try to be drag queens and, which reinforced cisness and the binary and those things, what would, what did that feel like, and what did that make possible for you? 

00:44:25
ISA Umm… it made a lot more uh… understanding I think possible, if that's like, the best way to put it. 

00:44:35
JULIE TILSEN Understanding like? 

00:44:35
ISA Umm… understanding like, not just myself and like, the stuff that I would do umm… like, as a drag queen but also seeing other people going through similar experiences of what I had went through and understanding that that's uh… a struggle and knowing that people are going through the struggle helps me umm… like, better community organize and uh… be a better, better advocate uh… for these people. 

00:45:10
JULIE TILSEN Are you saying, that when you were able to find language for yourself, it helped you feel like, you could show up how you wanted to or talk about your experience, what that made possible is that then you could go and show up for others? 

00:45:25
ISA Yeah. 

00:45:30
EM Yeah, same here, like, exactly the same here. Like, umm… I think like, once I like, figured out who I was like, it definitely opened up like, tons of doors that I didn't even know were there, like, umm… I think understanding I can have the agency to take control of my own identity uh… definitely just gives me the power to like create my future for myself. 

00:45:55
JULIE TILSEN You know, there's umm… this is all reminding me of a saying by Wittgenstein, he was a philosopher… 

00:46:05
EM I know who that is. 

00:46:05
JULIE TILSEN You do? 

00:46:05
EM No. 

00:46:10
JULIE TILSEN So, but anyway the saying is the limits of my language mean the limits of my world. It's like, is you two found some language options, your worlds expanded… 

00:46:20
EM Yeah. 

00:46:20
JULIE TILSEN …first you could show up and not feel like, you know, you weren't… 

00:46:25
EM Yeah, that's a good quote. 

00:46:30
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, the limits of my language mean the limits of my world and, and it's always so striking to me particularly for non-confirming, non-binary folks how umm… like, you said my school didn't teach me, my mom didn't teach me, you know, you- drag queen was available, let's try that, but maybe in some language to speak yourselves and to being… 

00:46:50
EM Yeah. 

00:46:55
JULIE TILSEN …expanded. 

00:46:55
EM Yeah, I think also like, umm… every community has its language, you know, and I think it's everyone's individual responsibility to understand and find the language. I think it's my responsibility to find the language that makes like, undocumented folks like, feel comfortable that makes disabled folks feel comfortable, you know, I think like, when we say we want to be in solidarity with other folks as like, people who are interested in being in solidarity with me I'm definitely just as inclined to be in solidarity with the person interested in making me safe, you know, And I'm definitely interested in learning the language that makes them feel better and I think it's a just a giant learning process for everyone. 

00:47:35
JULIE TILSEN What's the best way to learn that stuff? 

00:47:35
EM Asking. 

00:47:40
ISA Uh… exposure… 

00:47:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:47:40
ISA …for sure. 

00:47:40
EM Also the Internet like, like, definitely a big part of it is umm… educating yourself like, I think a lot of the work I've done to learn like, this language and the words for other communities I've looked up online and stuff and figured out online and it's umm… it's, it's labor that's what it is, it's labor and it's hard work and it's uncomfortable being told like, you need to be here for me, you know what I mean, and I think umm… but it's important work and it's necessary. 

00:48:10
JULIE TILSEN Is there anything that I haven't thought to ask about that is emerging for you, either of you that you'd like to speak to or something we touched on, you wanted to… 

00:48:25
EM Yeah, actually… 

00:48:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:48:25
EM Umm… You're… 

00:48:25
JULIE TILSEN Surprise me… 

00:48:25
EM You're talking about the little the little name cards or what did you say? 

00:48:30
JULIE TILSEN I said like, we're going to make flash cards. 

00:48:35
EM Flash cards, yeah. 

00:48:35
JULIE TILSEN …like, teachable things. 

00:48:35
EM Yeah, one of the flash cards I would create for someone is accessibility. Accessibility I think like, umm… the term was originated specifically for disabled folks who needed access to like, physical access to like, an building or an establishment. You know what I mean, it's important to like, be accessible for these folks. But then also the language like, transcends onto different identities… 

00:48:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:49:00
EM …you know, as for trans people like, can you be accessible for me and what that means for a like, me being a trans person is can you be accessible by using this accessible language like, not saying like, ladies and gentleman when I'm not neither, you know, I mean and I know a lot of people they don't think about it, but I'm constantly thinking about it, I'm in the room… 

00:49:20
JULIE TILSEN Right. 

00:49:20
EM …and umm… and there's small things, you know, like, being like, saying ladies and gentlemen and stuff but you know after hearing it for like, just the 30th time in like, the same day, you know, it like, it adds up. 

00:49:35
JULIE TILSEN Right. I guess you don't mean me, right? 

00:49:35
ISA Ladies and Gentlemen, All right, bye. 

00:49:40
JULIE TILSEN Bye. Yeah. 

00:49:40
EM Yeah. 

00:49:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

00:49:40
EM Yeah. 

00:49:45
JULIE TILSEN And we have… yeah, that's erasure, it's invisible and, you know, and that's, you know, I'm always concerned about what are the effects of that? You know these, there you go messing around; what are the effects of that, you know, I'm not, I'm not necessarily asking you to answer but… 

00:50:00
EM I can answer. No, sorry finish your sentence. 

00:50:05
JULIE TILSEN …yeah, that mean there's a, that's a crime spiritual violence it's, it's an… 

00:50:05
EM Yeah. 

00:50:10
JULIE TILSEN …it's an erasure… it's those assumptions umm… it's the effects of those assumptions that are very painful and can be very damaging. 

00:50:20
EM Yeah. Another buzzword is that its micro aggressive is what it is and it hurts… 

00:50:25
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, micro aggressions have some macro effect- impacts, right, yeah. 

00:50:30
ISA I feel aggression could be a flash card on its own, especially… 

00:50:30
EM Aggression? 

00:50:35
ISA …regarding, non-confirming folks and umm… trans people and queer people in general… 

00:50:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Are there some particular things with umm… gender queer non-confirming young people that you think need to be brought forward so we've talked about, you know, some intersections of race and culture and, and, and things like that, I'm wondering about age and, and for young people are there particular things that you would advise folks working with gender queer youth to be mindful of? 

00:51:20
ISA Umm… I feel uh… very much that not gendering somebody until you go up and ask their pronouns is something that uh… needs to be recognized umm… especially working with uh… gender non-conforming, gender queer youth… 

00:51:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:51:35
ISA …non-binary youth. 

00:51:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:51:40
ISA Umm… uh… because even though it may seem little it's like, an astronomical difference that, that's like… 

00:51:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:51:50
ISA …accessible. 

00:51:50
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, so pronouns are really super important with young people, are there other ways that, that either of you think that uh… gender non-confirming and trans youth umm… may be at risk or you know other considerations that people should umm… be attending to when they are working with young people? 

00:52:15
EM Be considerate, umm… I mean immediately when you say like, what else can you like, think about I think of like, homelessness and trans youth communities and stuff, you know, And people are often like, like, educators and stuff, you know. Like, I know a lot of teachers don't even think about how many students of theirs are homeless, you know, and like, that's like, it's heartbreaking, you know… 

00:52:35
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:52:35
EM …the fact that these are their students are homeless, you know, but also heartbreaking the fact that like, these educators don't like, even like, really aren't concerned with the fact that like, these little kids could be like, you know, like, on the streets and stuff, you know… 

00:52:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:52:50
EM …and it's just like, there's so much going on in like, just every individual's life, you know, like, we all have our struggle and it just like, it just gets worse for some specific individuals, you know? And… you know, just take into consideration just like, all these things, you know. 

00:53:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:53:05
ISA Umm… I wanted to add on, umm… to like, things to umm… take away, I guess, uh… er like, to keep in mind umm… is like, taking trans youth in general seriously when it comes to uh… talking about violence and shit that like, is an experience for a lot of queer trans youth, umm… I know being told like, police are there to help you is umm… something that I had to find out on my own wasn't umm… true in a sense… 

00:53:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:53:50
ISA …and uh… experiencing violence from random people as well as… er, experiencing violence from random people and going to police and experiencing more violence from them and then not being taken seriously… 

00:54:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:54:00
ISA …on the issue of that… 

00:54:00
JULIE TILSEN That's right. 

00:54:05
ISA …is uh… something that's like, very, very important. 

00:54:05
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, yeah, the assumption that the police are always helpful comes from a place of privilege and from people who have an experience that police aren't always helpful. 

00:54:15
EM Yeah. 

00:54:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, and in fact are harmful. 

00:54:15
EM Yeah. 

00:54:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. One other thing that, that I want to make sure I invite you two to speak to is umm… the problems of conflating gender and sexuality and particularly when we're talking about gender queer, non-confirming, non-binary folks, what advice would you have and what concerns should people be attending to when umm… they're trying to do their labor, trying to do their work and understanding gender and sexuality in, you know, this western North American context where we understand them as different, you know? 

00:55:00
EM Yeah, I think, some folks might be gay, some folks might be trans and sometimes some folks might be both and umm… I feel it's, I want to say it's that simple, but for some people it's like not, you know, but umm… yeah, I don't know, how to make it more simpler than that? 

00:55:15
JULIE TILSEN There's sexuality, there's gender. 

00:55:20
EM No literally like, there's, umm… there's like, your attraction to another individual and then there's how you identify and I don't know where along the lines people like mix them up and I think when, if it's confusion between sexuality and gender it's probably because they're not really inclined to separate them, I feel like, that's a personal thing. 

00:55:40
JULIE TILSEN It's a personal problem, huh? 

00:55:40
EM No, yeah, no it's literally a personal problem like, yeah, I know they're different. 

00:55:45
JULIE TILSEN Okay. 

00:55:50
ISA Umm… I feel that there's like, a lack of acknowledgement that they're different, and but uh… not just that they're different but that they can change at any point like, gender is always evolving and uh… like, right now I identify as gender queer fem-aligned, but umm… if I get a new perspective like, within my own life that could easily change and so could along with that but it not because of that… 

00:56:15
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:56:20
ISA … umm… my sexual orientation… 

00:56:25
JULIE TILSEN Right, right. So, when you t-… one of the things when you're saying umm… things are always evolving, this is who I am right now, one of the thigns that I say when, you know, I'm trying to explain to people gender and people who're maybe non-binary gender fluid, gender queer, I say, you know, sometimes, like, who you meet today may not be who you meet tomorrow. 

00:56:50
EM Yeah. 

00:56:55
JULIE TILSEN And that makes you wonder, what do, what do you think it would be like, let's say the, the, the gender unicorn just showed up one day and it was, you know, burping rainbows and making all gender things possible for all people. 

00:57:10
EM Yeah. 

00:57:10
JULIE TILSEN And what do you think then would happen to so called cisgender people? 

00:57:20
ISA I feel like, there wouldn't be cisness in a sense, and there wouldn't be binary, there wouldn't be any form of uh… label um, that people can use to categorize other people. 

00:57:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah, what would we do to get to know each other? How would we do that? I'm being a little facetious, right? But, but, we, we use gender so much to get to know each other. So if it became like that, how, what would we do to get to know each other? How do we do that? 

00:57:55
EM We talk, I don't know but… Sorry for that. I just I got caught off guard… 

00:58:00
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

00:58:00
EM …yeah, no, we talk and be present and like, create community like, as I think we all should. 

00:58:10
ISA And I feel get to know each other on more of a base, like, human level, than superficial like, I'm a guy, you're a girl, you know, let's hook up or whatever… 

00:58:20
EM Yeah, I think if the gender uniform, unicorn came to like, save us and like, she got rid of it all like… 

00:58:25
JULIE TILSEN You've made her a girl. 

00:58:30
EM …yeah, she's a woman. I think if she came to save us then like, umm… because they feel like, like, I said before like, people are really scared of trans people for some reason just because they don't know what like, they don't know who we are, you know what I mean, they don't know our stories and they just because umm… the media like, silences are stories, you know what I mean? And umm… if like, that fear was gone then like, like, everyone would be present for each other. You know what I mean and like, we wouldn't be afraid to ask questions or be close to people like, just for an example like, like, men don't talk to me, like, this just is… something I've noticed… 

00:59:05
JULIE TILSEN Like cis dudes? 

00:59:05
EM …yeah, no, day to day basis I know like, cis guys don't talk to me, and because I express myself feminine we and I… I like, wear makeup, and I wear feminine clothing and stuff and like, people don't like that and like, if like, the unicorn were to come save us then I feel like, you know, like, they just opens up the door for just so many more like, relationships to happen between other humans. 

00:59:30
JULIE TILSEN You know, just really smacks me, strikes me really heavy when you both answer that, that there is a way that as central as gender is like, everybody cares about it, when we start a conversation it's so there and it functions so much in such a restrictive way as a barrier, as a hindrance. 

00:59:50
EM Yeah. 

00:59:50
JULIE TILSEN And you're saying that well, you know, gender can be fun and there's, there's, it's a vehicle for expression and play. 

01:00:00
EM Yeah. 

01:00:00
JULIE TILSEN …it operates so much like, a barrier and a hindrance. 

01:00:00
EM Yeah, I like… 

01:00:00
JULIE TILSEN …between people. 

01:00:05
EM …like, how you said it like, I'd like, reverse it, you know I mean? Like, I think like, gender and it's implications are like, really restricting, you know what I mean, but I feel like, trans people are like, reforming it, you know what I mean like, me personally I'm using what is a barrier as you described it. It was, it's like, constantly like, suffocating me everyday, you know, I mean I'm using it to liberate myself and I'm using it to express myself… 

01:00:30
JULIE TILSEN It's like a resource for you? 

01:00:30
EM Yeah. 

01:00:30
JULIE TILSEN It's like, a flexible resource that, that you can use in different ways. 

01:00:35
EM Yeah, that's what I think like, all queer and trans people like, like, we have like, like… 

01:00:40
JULIE TILSEN You're the unicorns… 

01:00:40
EM …we all reach out to each other, you know. 

01:00:45
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. Any other thoughts that are lingering, anything I haven't thought about or we haven't thought about together that, you'd want to throw out there?… 

01:00:55
EM I guess, I could say one thing. 

01:00:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:01:00
JULIE TILSEN I just really think community is really important between everyone, you know? And I think umm… if like, if I had like, if every time I entered like, umm… a therapist's office or reached out to like, a superior or like, like, you know what I mean, like, an adult in my life and like, like, I wish they, like, were as serious as creating community with me as much as I am with them, you know? 

01:01:30
JULIE TILSEN Can you say umm… what that looks like, what like, an example of creating community is… 

01:01:35
EM Yeah. 

01:01:35
JULIE TILSEN …like, you would hope for like, if, if you went into an adult's office, a teacher or a therapist, somebody's office, and you left it going, they create a community or they-- there was an intention of community here, what would have happened? 

01:01:50
EM You'd be, they'd be taking it serious, they'd be taking everything I said serious and umm… they wouldn't think twice about what I'm saying. And they'd listen and like, I'd listen to them, you know, that's just how communication works, but yeah. 

01:02:10
JULIE TILSEN Isa? 

01:02:15
ISA Umm… nah, I don't think I have anything to add. 

01:02:20
JULIE TILSEN Okay. How has this conversation been for you guys? 

01:02:20
EM It's kind of like, because like, as much as like, gender is a big part of my life I kind of forget like, I'm like, in a like, I'm trapped in it, you know what I mean, like, umm… yeah, I experience violence all the time, you know what I mean, so it's like, when people ask like, do you experience violence, I'md like, yeah, I actually I actually do, you know, because I'm not constantly talking about it… 

01:02:40
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:02:45
EM …but umm… it's kind of like, just awakening, you know, just to see like, this is who I am and umm… not all people know that but… 

01:02:55
ISA Yeah, that's it. 

01:03:00
JULIE TILSEN So this conversation has been an awakening for you? 

01:03:05
EM Well, not awake… not an awakening but like, a reminder, a reminder, yeah. 

01:03:10
JULIE TILSEN And what is being reminded of some of these things made possible for you? What would you like to do with this reminding? 

01:03:15
EM Just grow from it and like, learn that like… 

01:03:20
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:03:20
EM Yeah. 

01:03:20
JULIE TILSEN Cool. How about for you, how has this conversation been? 

01:03:25
ISA Umm… this conversation for me is uh… very much like, also a reminder of why I stay in the community, like, being able share like, my story, my perspective and letting it not be lost as something that is very important especially umm… going through struggles with violence and with umm… advocacy. 

01:03:55
JULIE TILSEN Yeah. 

01:03:55
ISA Yeah. 

01:03:55
JULIE TILSEN Okay. Well, for me it's uh… been experience, an experience where I'm leaving with so much gratitude for your generosity of sharing your knowledge and your very personal experiences umm… on behalf of we don't know who, you know, and the people trying to, to learn from you and umm… a lot of gratitude as uh… visitor to your space, this is your space, this is your city, and as a cisgender old white person. Umm… I don't at all take for granted umm… the generosity of your vulnerability sharing with me. So I'm very grateful and uh… you know, I'm going to always have a bit of Isa and Em with me wherever I go. So, uh… thank you for letting me go back home richer because of this.
