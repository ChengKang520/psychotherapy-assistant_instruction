NATE CHATTERTON Before I worked with Ron I was facing challenges with anxiety. Uh, the two jobs, uhm, which failed, are, uh, the health spa. Uhm, I was too slow, I couldn't finish the rows(ph) in time. Uh, the second one was a supermarket, they were giving me too many jobs, I couldn't handle it. Uhm, I, uh, my food habits were donuts every morning, desserts at night and pizza every week. I want to, I, I lost 30 pounds and I want to lose more to get to 165. Uh, my social, uhm, skills, were okay but I didn't, when I was nervous or anxious, I didn't talk much, said one letter answers. Uhm, but now I think it's getting better.

00:04:35
 Ron is a very exuberant person. He's a very unusual person and a born teacher. He has a lot of positive energy, uh, he radiates good will and I feel like Nathan has learned how to focus, uh, he has been very motivated by Ron, because, uh, Ron is just a very strong force and when you're in room with Ron, uh, uh, you're just sucked right in and everything he says to you, you remember and you take right in. And I think this is what has happened with Nathan. He needed someone other than a parent to, uh, talk to him about his need to be his own person. 

00:05:15
NATE CHATTERTON I am more confident about getting a job (inaudible ) and I feel better about myself. 

00:05:21
DRU CHATTERTON I think a mentor was better for Nathan, was much more beneficial for him than a councilor. I think counseling was good for Nathan, but it was a lot of words and it was a lot of reflection and it was a lot of insightful thinking and I think Nathan needed to get physical and he needed to find his center, and I think, uh, Ron helped him to find that path. Uhm, Nate needed some energy and he needed to stand tall and become his own person and find his own path and claim that path and he did. 

00:06:00
NATE CHATTERTON I like to say that through dedication and focus, you too can become where I am.

RON RUBIO Hi I'm Ron Rubio. In my work with children and young adults on the autism spectrum, which includes Asperger's syndrome, this is what I observed through the years. I have seen a disconnection of their mind to their bodies, and this is displayed in certain behaviors such as social situations, being too close to you, being too far away. They don’t understand how they are in space. Other examples are the inability to do simple things like catching balls, throwing balls, being aware of their bodies physically. Therefore it limits their ability to do social games. This also shows up in the classroom or as you know, at home, during stressful times. For instance, uh, the individual is at the desk, he’s having a hard or she’s having a hard time with the, uh, problem, they lose it and they have a meltdown. Now we know this happens quite a lot because their inability to charge and discharge energy. This is that disconnection I’m speaking about of mind and body. What you’ll be seeing on the DVD are basic fundamental exercises of my work, the pathfinder mentoring. These exercises are very simple, yet they’re going to be challenging at first because of the fact you’re learning something new and so though they look simple, you’re going to have to just take your time and learn by pausing, reviewing, using the DVD as a tool. Now since these exercises are simple they can be done in the classroom and at home. I use these exercises to bring the kids back in if they’re a little wild in the classroom, I’ll say let’s do one of these exercises, it tends to bring them back down into a place of focus and calmness. So please, enjoy what you’ll be seeing and I’ll see you at the end of the DVD. Thank you so much.

Breathing and Clearing Slate 

00:08:10
RON RUBIO What we're going to study first is the breathing and how to breathe through the body. And what we're going to start off with is how to just breathe through the face, so a breath cycle is inhale through the nose and one exhale out the mouth. So, you see people breathe like this through the face sometimes, when they're overly thinking about the exercise, they start breathing this way or closing the eyes and really using way too much muscles. There's 26 muscles in the face. So the way I would like for you to try, is this breathing very relaxly through the nose, and very relaxly out the mouth. 

00:08:45
Breath Cycle: One inhale through nose, one exhale through a relaxed mouth 

00:08:45
relax the facial muscles as you breathe 

00:08:50
RON RUBIO Where you relax the jaw and the facial mask, which is your cheeks and the energy around the mouth. So once again, breathe with me on this one. You breathe quietly and gently through the nose, and relaxly out your mouth. We try that again. So breathing this way allows you to relax your face, the neck and your chest. So, in the following exercises, this is the way we're going to try to use the face in a very neutral way. So last time breathing through the nose and exhaling out the mouth. Good. So as we understand this breathing concept through the face, let's kind of move this type of relaxation of muscle, downward into our belly. So, as we start focusing on the belly, let's see how this effects the shoulders. So as we see people breathing I, I myself, as I have asthma, so when I use to have asthmatic tension, I use to breathe all up in my chest, ribcage really engaging, shoulders and energy stuck in my neck. So what I'm asking myself to do, is to really start breathing with a lower part of my body. So, again, as we breathe gently through our noses, we're going to fill our belly now like it's a big balloon. 

00:10:10
fully belly breath like a balloon 

00:10:10

belly breath while standing 

00:10:10
inhale 

00:10:15
RON RUBIO And on the exhale through our very relaxed mouth, we just allow this belly breath to dissipate and relax. So again, as we take the inhale we breathe through the belly and on the exhale we just allow the belly to relax. It's called vacuuming or flattening out the abs. All right? So these are the two distinctions. One is breathing with the upper body using way too much energy. The other way to drop energy gravity, energy and gravity down into the belly, so we're using a more grounded breath. So again we're breathing with the belly which is filling the belly on the inhale and exhaling flattening out the belly. Let's try that again. So what you do when you're doing this, you'll find a nice support for your lower back because if you're breathing with your belly, in this part of our bodies, the lower back is really supported. Good. So let's do one exercise which is called mysogi. Mysogi is a Japanese word to imply purification or the act of clearing slate, cleaning out. So a minute for mysogi, let's bring our feet together, so now we're kind of standing with our sense of nice body and with this exercise this is done very simply with arms. Again, it begins with a simple breathing through the face, so we breathe through our nose and exhale out our mouths. We fill the belly on the inhale and we flatten out the belly on the exhale. We add the arms. So, I'm going to start with my hands very relaxly, fingertips touching and I'm looking downwards and I'm going to follow the movement of energy through my body, meaning as I breathe in I feel my body on the inhale, I raise my arms slowly up, at the top of the movement I hold it for a second and I begin the exhale and my hands will float downwards through the center line of my body. So let's try that again. So we begin again, fingertips touching and as we breathe in the arms move up the side of the body, this is the inhale. We hold it for a moment, sinking the breath into the belly and then long, long exhale. 

00:12:40

00:12:40

00:12:40

00:12:45
RON RUBIO So let's try three breaths of mysogi. And breath in, hold it for a second, long exhale. Head follows the movement of the hands. We breathe in through the nose, filling the belly, we hold for a second on the exhale, flattening out the belly, hands floating downward as well as our gaze. And last time. Full breath, long exhale. So during training I use these breaths of mysogi to clear a slate in between exercises or if I find the students or my client getting agitated or stress or kind of feeling, uh, nervous, I'll tell my students or clients to please do three breaths of mysogi to clear out and settle down.

00:13:55
RON RUBIO So now that we understand breathing, let's move breathing into the points of alignment. Points of alignment is a way to adjust body alignment by stacking the body parts right on top of each other, which allows us to find a nice stable position. And we start the points of alignment from the ground up, so we start in our feet. The feet, there is a way to stay into earth and stay plugged in to earth. So what I've discovered is this points of alignment, that the tripod points, which is the first points, is a structure where you have the large toe metatarsal, small toe metatarsal in your heel and if you could imagine now, a three prong plug and earth Is the outlet and you're plugging this, your feet, into the outlet. So you're really kind of establishing this grounded position through your feet. So when we're standing, you want to make sure that we're not standing on the balls of our feet, which sends our body forward or weight on the heels which sends our body back, which locks the lower back. Or when we have collapse in the feet inwardly or outwardly. We want to have that sense of tripod awareness in the feet stabilized, so it's very, very grounded. As we move up at the points of alignment, we'll start establishing this feet to ankles. So if sometimes we find our feet gripping we’re in our shoes or barefoot, really kind of gripping our toes, puts a lot of stress on the ankles. So we would like to release that kind of stress so the ankles are free to be very relaxed, yeah? Just like that. And as you continue to move up into the knees, now the knees are the shock absorbers of the body. So, if we lock the knees, which is a common case especially if we stand in position like this and we're putting one weight and one leg. That leg here, this leg here, is going to be the leg that's locked, the knee is locked.

00:16:00
RON RUBIO If we go back to those points of alignment, again, knees are the shock absorbers of the body, we want to have the knees slightly bent. Again, locking the knees sends the body forward, too much knee bend sends the body back. So you want to find that balance point where the knees are just ever so slightly softened. Okay? That gives us shock absorber quality that we want for our entire body. As we move upwards into the pelvic girdle, to the pelvis. The pelvis floats right on top of the legs, both legs. Now what I have observed is that sometimes students, clients, they tend to lock one leg, one hip. Like women with the back, with the, uh, purse, uh, students with backpacks so they have all this weight on one hip. And so the pelvis is actually at an angle, so what we want to establish is where the pelvis floats right on top of the legs in equilibrium, right? So we're not shifting the weight so much as allowing the pelvis to float right on top of the legs. As we continue up now, we're back to that belly breathing concept. There it is. Right? So our breath is here, reminding ourselves to fill on the inhale and flat down on the exhale. Right? As we breathe through our noses we fill the belly and as we breathe out our mouth, the belly flattens out. In doing so, this allows the upper body energy to drop downwards and give that lower back that support. If you can imagine that the breathing of the belly engages lower back muscles for upper body verticle alignment. Moving upwards now. So we were at the belly breath, we're moving up now towards the chest. In the chest, I've established this point, this sunburst point which is located right in the sternum and the other point is located right between the shoulder blades. Now I call it the sunburst point because if you can imagine energy pushing outwards or exploding or bursting, that quality of bursting. Well if I put all the energy in my chest, energy bursting out of my chest right? It will look like this. Right? Throwing that chest out, sway back position in the lower back, see how the sway back is right there in the lower back? If I put all the energy in the point between my shoulder blades, it will look like this, which is a common position by the way, for a lot of people wear backpacks, they tend to bring the shoulders forward and now their pelvis is in a slight tuck position. So the two points we want to get away from is this hyper extension of the upper body or the hypo extension. So the energy of the sunburst point allows us to be in a very neutral position. Arms sit quietly in the shoulder joints, so you're not gripping the arms, the arms are very relaxed. So as we continue upwards now, always starting from the feet up, we're starting to move up towards the throat. Now in the throat, a lot of energy gets caught up because if we hold our head forward of the body like that, there’s a lot of stress in the shoulders.

00:19:20
RON RUBIO Adversely, if we bring the head behind the body, oh my weights on my heels and that puts a lot of stress on my back. So what I want to feel is my neck extending energy, this kind of pushing downwards to extend through my neck, so my neck is actually lengthening. Finally, as we move past the neck energy and we're in our head, the structure of our head, how our head sits on our neck. If we wear backpacks, I'm going back to this backpack example because this is very true in most students and people who wear backpacks, the head is way forward of the body because if you're wearing a backpack, the body is trying to balance itself. So you get this type of position. All right? So working with the head, you need to bring the head back, not back and raising your chin, but laterally back and lengthening the back of the neck. So, lengthening the back of the neck, doesn't talk about raising your chin, or dropping your chin. You must imagine a invisible geometric plane of reference. So my face is parallel to a flat geometric plane, so my face is this way. Right? Instead of chin up or chin down. So for a quick review, let's go back to the points of alignment and we start from the feet up. So once again we have the tripod points of awareness in our feet, again that's the large toe metatarsal, small toe metatarsal in the heel and we plant that tripod into the ground, visualizing that our feet are like plugs, earth is the outlet and you're plugging into earth. Establishing that position of groundedness through our feet, we relax the ankles, as we move up towards the knees slowly, the knees are showing the shock absorber quality so again we're not locking or over exaggerating the bending of legs, pelvis floats right on top of the legs. So we're not in the shifted pelvis positions. We move towards the belly, again there's that belly breathing. Right, then we continue to move up to the sunburst point where we allow this energy that moves outwards of our bodies to be in equilibrium so we're not in this position or that position, but a neutral position, neutral position. The neck is lengthened, not shortened. Not shortened but lengthened and the head, the head sits right on top of the neck. So what we find is one body part lining right on top of the other in a very balanced way, which allows our pelvis, our hips, our knees and ankles to be releasing old stress. Backache starts to release shoulders, tension in the shoulders and neck is released. So to finish, so that we can move on to the next exercise, we’re going to do three breaths of mysogi as we try to do it every time we want to change so we can clear a slate. So, we begin now, we establish this position and three breaths of mysogi to finish the points of alignment. We breath in slowly through our noses, filling the belly on the exhale out the mouth, flattening out the belly. So we use this breath to purify our minds, to clear out our thoughts, so we can be mindful of what we do in our bodies and in our lives. Last time and then we just stand to finish.

RON RUBIO Now that we've studied the points of alignment, we're going to take that sense of awareness of alignment to something simple as sitting and this is going to be called sitting on your throne position or sitting on your throne exercise. First off let's just see how other people sit. So people sit sometimes where they kind of lounge in their chairs like this way. Notice that there's no support of the back at all, that's why we, coming out of these positions we feel stress in our shoulders and in our backs. Others sit with the small of their backs all the way over, all the way back but then it drives their shoulders forward. Very similar, when we, in front of the computer typing, or driving. So, what I'd like for us to study is how to sit proactively, meaning how to be thinking while you're sitting. I like to move more to the edge of my chair, which really forces me to start using that belly breath that we've been talking about supporting my posture and what I like to find in my alignment from the ground up, is that nice feet, my feet are really organized, planted. My knees are not floating in and out but really establishing knee over foot alignment. Again, just like the points of alignment, as you work up towards the body, see how the pelvis is right on top of the legs. If I was standing, not behind or in front of, but really right on top where it should be. This allows the torso to come out of these, again, hyperextensions as if we were standing, to a neutral position, and for the exercise I like my students and clients just to have their hands gently on their knees for now. So elbows relaxed so you're not gripping the upper body or rolling in the back. See, there's that caved in chest again, or hyperextension there's that swayback, which really puts a lot of tension the lower back. So again, upper body relaxation occurs because we’re breathing more deeply into the belly, dropping that gravity from the top, downwards into a more grounded place in our bodies which is the pelvis. So, our hands are relaxed on our knees, we engage the sunburst point in our chest so our chest is relaxed, again, coming under those hyper positions and like a scale, like a scale our shoulders are able to adjust on this plane or this way. All right, so heavy elbows allows for this dropping of shoulders. And lastly as we’ve been working in the points of alignment, is the throat, all right, so there we have that extension, the long back of the neck and the head sits right on top of the neck rather than in front of the neck, behind the neck, to one side, or to the other. So everything kind of lines up, and we call this sitting in your throne position, because we like to use the visualization or the seeing in our minds eye, a sense of you’re sitting on a throne. And if you’re sitting on your throne you’re thinking about honor, integrity, power. So you’re not sitting on your throne like this, or you’re not sitting on your throne like that. You’re sitting on your throne with a sense of power that moves through the body in equilibrium. So this is a proactive way a sitting, sitting on your throne exercise and what we’ll do as we’ve done in other exercises, we’ll be finishing with mysogi and we can do that in a sitting position. We start, instead of our hands here in the middle, we start with our hands to the side and it looks like this. See how it’s still the same, except at this part we just kind of let the arms float outside of our legs. So, let’s try three breaths of mysogi now to finish up and we’ll move on to the next exercise. So we start with our hands very relaxed, shoulders relaxed and we begin by lowering our gaze as we breathe into the belly, we hold it for a second and long exhale. Again, we breathe in through the belly, clearing slate, clearing our minds for the next exercise. Last time, full inhale and long, long exhale and to finish, go back to that neutral position, hands on knees, very relaxed and we hold.

RON RUBIO Now I'm going to cover the concept of balancing. In balancing, we would like to see our bodies as one meaning that I'm really keeping my spine long as I'm pushing down into the ground. This sense of resistance using the earth is very important in keeping upper body posture. So, I can best illustrate this by the dance movement called the sauter. The sauter looks something like this. I’m going to bend my knees and push against the ground, I’m going to sauter. Very simple, very, very, very simple. Once again, I’m going to release the spring in my, my shock absorbers and I’m going to push downwards in order to go upwards. It’s this kind of feeling of pushing down to go up. Like that. Now, these are the illustrations of what happens if I just think down. If I just think down to go up, I’m going to do something like this, I’m going to barely move, can get my body off the ground. If I think up to go up, I'm going to do something like this. I, again, I'm not using the resistance to push in to the ground, I'm just kind of leaving my body, my posture actually, you can see my body doing this. So now, I would like us to think about how earth is going to be the resisting force. Meaning, I'm pushing downwards to go upwards. This concept we're going to be using balancing. This is a very, very simple exercise that I work with my students. I'm going to use a chair and I, I ask my students and clients to, when understanding balancing or practicing balancing, is to be safe, meaning release the anxiety and stress, we're trying to balance by using a tool, in this case a chair or it could be the table, or the counter of the kitchen that you could use to test your balance. I'm going to start in this simple position, all right, and it looks like this. I'm going to lightly touch this tool, the chair, so I can just release all the stress of trying to do this and trying to do it perfect. I'm going to use the chair to help me find my balance. So, for the first thing in balancing is maintain a neutral position in the body. In order to maintain my posture, I'm pushing through my feet and opening up my upper body. So I'm, again, this sense of oppositional forces at play, pushing down to go up. So to balance, I'm going to balance on one leg and doing so is very, very, very simple, watch. Again, I'm holding the chair just to release the need to try to stress myself out, I'm going to use this tool to help me. First, my weight is on both legs. This is challenging for the people who stand like this during the day, where the weight is on the one hip, right, so when standing on two legs, really allows us to feel the power of our pelvis, hip joints and reclaiming the leg that use to just fly around. See, this has no weight on it, this has all the body weight. So here I am, weight equally distributed as it comes down my spine, transfers to my hip joints and down both legs. So that's the powerful stance of neutral position. Now, in order to balance, I have to do a shift and when I go shift to my, my left leg. So at first I take my whole body, I shift to the left leg. Now my weight is on the left foot and I’m going to push through my left leg, in order to lift my right. See? Now in order to put this leg down, if I just think putting down I’m going to do this, I’ll just drop. So if my leg here, if I’m going to push my leg down, I have to extend my energy upwards, okay, so watch. As I put the leg down I think upwards, upwards, upwards and then I can put the foot back down. I’ll try the other leg now. So once again I establish this neutral position, I use a chair to help me balance and I don’t have to stress myself, stay very calm, very safe. I’m going to shift my weight now to my right leg. Now in doing so when I shift I don’t want to release in the hip joint. My right leg, known as the standing leg, would remain totally extended, extended. So I’m going to shift my body weight to my right leg. As I push through my entire body down to my standing leg, right leg, it allows me to free up my left leg so I can push down through my right leg to lift my left. In order to lift the left leg back down, again, I have to think up because I’m pushing, I’m releasing something downwards. So I think upwards to lower. So to practice balancing, which allows us to be balanced for sports, any activity, proper walking, proper running, we learn again to feel weight on both feet. For the last time, I will show you a balance and this is how we use it with breath. As I breathe in I shift, on the exhale I lift. I breathe in, on the exhale, I lower, thinking up to lower back down and now I’m ready to do the other side. As I breathe in, I shift my body weight to the standing leg and on the exhale and push in, downwards down through the standing leg to lift the left leg. To test yourself, you just release the chair, your arms are down and you just push. Now remember, when you’re trying to balance without a tool, be careful that, again, you don’t release the upper body and you start collapsing and that’s going to fall you off balance or holding your breath when you’re trying to balance and then all the way it comes up. So when you want to balance, you want to stay very calm, as we learned in the point of alignment, there’s that nice belly breath here, the breath is here, not here, here in this nice sense of gravity in the center line of our body and I can pretty much hold this for a long time because I’m not stressing, because I’m pushing through with my right leg to maintain this equilibrium of balance. I breathe in on the exhale and I reverse it. To lower the leg I have to think up. So balancing I always tell clients, is a mind body phenomenon. You can’t just it with your mind and you can’t just do it with your body, it’s a combination of both and unification of mind body. So when you try balancing at home or in the classroom, again, try to do this at first with a tool, a chair, a desk, something so you can release any type of stress in the learning process. So to finish, do your breaths of mysogi, that’s what we do after each exercise. Do three breaths of mysogi to finish and I breathe in and I exhale. Full, rich exhale. Twice more.

Three Basic Movements of Aikido 

00:35:45
RON RUBIO Now I'm going to show you the three basic movements in aikido, irimi, tenkan and kaiten. In all movements we're training ourselves to move as one piece, because some of the work that I've done, I have seen students and clients move their bodies in fragments, leaving different body parts behind or leading with their heads, leaving their pelvis behind. So teaching these three movements really reinforce this idea of whole mind body, moving from one point to the next. This stick here, known as the joe or staff in aikido, represents the line of fire, meaning any energy coming at you that you're going to have to either deal with or get off the line. So this stick represents a punch, a kick, someone grabbing at you, something pushing at you, on a martial level that's what you're kind of thinking. And so, when we move off the line of fire, we move into a place of safety, non-conflict, we're blending and that's the essence of aikido. So what I'm going to show you now is the first movement called irimi. 

00:37:00
[sil.] 

00:37:00
First Movement Irimi (to enter) 

00:37:00
be honest 

00:37:00
start behind the stick (line of fire) 

00:37:00
slide instead of step 

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
move on exhale 

00:37:00
angle to line of fire 

00:37:00
start with a charged body 

00:37:00
eyes parallel to ground, vision out 

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
move on exhale 

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
exhale 

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
exhale 

00:37:00

00:37:00

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
exhale 

00:37:00
inhale 

00:37:00
exhale 

00:37:00
finish with extension 

00:37:05
RON RUBIO Now irimi means to enter. When I'm entering up a line of fire, I have to again make sure that I'm taking everything with me and this is a very, very, very easy exercise to learn. First off, I'm going to put my foot right behind the stick so I am very honest about my movement. I'm not going to start off the line of fire already, I'm going to establish myself right behind the stick. Now if you try this it can be a broomstick, candle, this could be a dowel, this could be anything that represents a line. You can put some masking tape on the ground or anything that shows you a line that you have to get off and refer yourself to. So irimi starts like this. My hand starts here, and I'm just going to bring my hands up like this, very simply, right. Now my legs will do this, I'm going to slide, to step, you see actually take a step with the back foot. To slide is to maintain the same foot that's forward when you're finished doing the movement. For instance, in irimi, as I slide the right foot will remain forward. Again, stepping is to use the opposite leg, this case the rear leg, and sliding means to maintain the same foot forward as you started. So together now, arms and legs, irimi looks like this. Again, staying safe. So my hands start here, I breathe in, on the exhale I slide forward, take my whole body with me and notice that I'm at an angle to the line of fire. I'm not parallel, I'm on an angle 30 degrees or less, why, because this is a martial art class and someone tried to punch me, I'd move off the line of fire and now I can respond to this person. I'm out of the way, this person would be roughly right in here. So again, I start with my foot, my right foot in this case, right behind the stick representing the line of fire. I'll show four movements and then I'll switch to the other side. So I start with my palms facing outwards and then when I slide in I'll bring my hands this way. In the martial arts this is called the, the knife edge or the sword blade of your hand, right? So, in, in the martial arts, if you study weapons and you place the weapon down, your hands actually become the sword, the knife, whatever you've been training in. So the extension happens through the cutting edge of the hand. So, this is irimi, to enter I start with full body charge, again, from a side view I'm not going to start like this, I'm going to really, as we studied, in the balancing exercises to push in to the ground to the length of the spine. So I must start with a charged body. I'm not looking down, I'm looking eyes parallel to the ground as if I'm looking at somebody. So I begin with this charged body. I breathe in, on the exhale I slide in keeping everything together. As I inhale, I take a step with my back foot and get myself back behind the line of fire so I can continue the exercise. I'll do four now. 

00:40:25
[sil.] 

00:40:35
RON RUBIO So when I finish, I want a short extension. This is collapsing, hyperextension, extension. Reminding ourselves as we did in the points of alignment, the sunburst point charging the upper body, head not in front of the torso, but right on top of the torso. A common mistake before I switch to the other side, a common mistake is this, people moving off the line and leaving something on the line. Now if there was a sword coming down that leg would be cut off or some people don't even move off the line. Now if you're going to stay on the line of fire you'd better own the line of fire, meaning I have to do some type of movement to make sure that whatever's coming toward me I can, uh, resolve it or else I'm just going to get hit. So when we move we must think whole mind body, everything moving off the line. I'll show you the left side now. Now I've established my left foot behind the line of fire, open my chest, sunburst point, body aligned, body charged. I breathe in, on the exhale I slide forward. I inhale, I exhale. I move as one piece leaving nothing on the line of fire and last time and I hold and check. I check them again, tripod awareness I basically go through my points of alignment. Shock absorbers, upper body extension through my sunburst points, I'm not like this, or like that. Extension in my sword blades of my hands, so I'm not collapsing my extension or hyper extending. I'm very solidly connected to my core strength, my spine. My head is right on top of my body, not in front, not behind. I'm really solid and that is the movement irimi. 

00:42:30
[sil.] 

00:42:30
Second Movement Tenkan (to turn) 

00:42:30
start with hand up 

00:42:30
curl hand to point at belly 

00:42:30
back leg draws half circle on ground 

00:42:30
finish with charged body 

00:42:30
to get back to neutral 

00:42:30
step back with back foot and pivot 

00:42:30
inhale 

00:42:30
exhale 

00:42:30
tenkan 

00:42:35
Ron RubioTenkan means to turn, so as in the first movement irimi, I'm still going to slide out the line of fire, but this time I'm going to turn my body 180 degrees. So I'm going to start from this angle here so you can see how it actually looks, this is a better angle. So now I'm going to stand behind the line of fire here. In the movement of tenkan for exercise sake, we start with this hand here because we imagine someone holding the hand, the wrist. And so I'm going to give the person the wrist, I'm not going to fight the wrist, I'm going to curl my wrist, my hands towards my belly button, breaking the energy of the person's hold. I'm going to leave this wrist here, I'm going to slide off the line of fire, now my back leg will do a full, a, a half circle on the ground, so I finish here. All right? And notice that I'm finishing a charged body again, I'm not leaning on the back leg, too far forward, collapse in the upper body, hyper extending the upper body. My body is very charged. To get back to neutral, to get back to the starting point, I'm going to step with my back foot and then pivot so I can do the same side over again. So once again, for the movement of tenkan, the hands are going to start here, you're going to curl your fingers toward your belly button, imagining that someone's grabbing you here, so as you do the movement you don't want to move your arm, you’re going to leave it here imagining that, what I like to tell my students, is that there is a nice pole coming from the ceiling and you're here so as you slide in the hand stays there. All right, the hand stays there so the hand is going to break the energy of someone's grabbing you. You're going to stay in that position and you're going to move your whole body behind that position. Okay? So, I'll show you four movements of tenkan to turn. This is your inhale, this is your exhale. As I breathe in I step, pivot, on the exhale I try it again. If you would like to make this a two breath movement, this is my breathing in, this is my breath out. This is my breath in, this is my breath out. That's a two breath cycle movement. I breathe in, exhale. Breathe in, I exhale. Tenkan to turn. 

00:45:20

00:45:20

00:45:20

00:45:20

00:45:20

00:45:20
exhale 

00:45:20
finish with extension 

00:45:30
RON RUBIO I'm going to show you two different views of the movement of kaiten because it looks similar to tenkan, but again we're pivoting and not turning. So first this angle. I establish the line of fire, and I'll be referring my body movement too. Once again I stand right behind the line of fire, the first movement is irimi, getting out of the way. Second movement is leaving my feet where they are and just pivoting. All right, let's just do the legs. Let's just study the legs. The legs again, moving off sliding, see that's sliding this is stepping, that's stepping see. And this is sliding, I slide up the line of fire like irimi and now I just pivot my pelvis and let my feet swivel naturally. So when I turn my body I don't want to leave my feet like this. I have to let my feet naturally be attached to my hip joints. So kaiten from this angle, you will see, that I have to slide in and whatever my back foot was, in this case my right foot, it'll become my front foot. See? Now it's my front foot. To get back to neutral, I slide back and unpivot. So kaiten looks like this, from this angle. Again I finish with extension. Now I'm going to show you from this other angle so maybe you get a better idea. I'm going to put the stick representing the line of fire, on this angle. I'll start with the other foot forward and watch this is what the legs do from this angle. Once again I'm sliding. See? There's that sliding motion. This is stepping so be careful to know the distinction between sliding and stepping. All right, so we slide forward off the line of fire, leaving our feet where they are, using the energy of the pelvis turning or opening to pivot in our feet. To get back to neutral, I slide forward and unpivot. So, four kaitens. I breathe in, I breathe out. 

00:48:00
[sil.] 

00:48:00
in all movements activate points of alignment 

00:48:00
the breaths of mysogi to finish 

00:48:05
RON RUBIO When I finish, full extension of the body. Again, going through my points of alignment, tripod points of my feet activated, shock absorbers relaxed, not locked, relaxed. All right? Upper body is charged with my belly breath as we studied in the points of alignment. The sunburst point in my upper back and my chest is pushing out that energy so not collapsing or hyper extending, I'm very charged, energy at the sword blades of my hands, and I finish. Good. And to finish all exercises as we've been doing for the entire DVD, we're going to do three breaths of mysogi. 

00:48:50

00:49:10

00:49:25
RON RUBIO Now I'm going to demonstrate exercises that you can do lying on your back. These exercises are so beneficial because it allows you to deal with gravity in a very different way. When you're standing, gravity is pushing downwards onto the back, to your spine, pelvis, all your joints. So lying on your back allows you to deal with gravity in a way that allows for different types of energy flow through your joints. So, I'm going to make my way down to my back, now that I'm lying on my back, I'm dealing with gravity very differently. If I was standing, gravity would be pushing down top of my head through my spine. Well here, lying down, gravity is actually pushing me this way, the front of my body, the whole of my body. So by keeping my feet together, my knees together, I get a sense of my legs even in this position. I'm still working the tripod points of my feet, remember plugging into earth? So I'm plugging into earth with my feet. Squeezing my knees together charges my inner thigh muscles which gives me that stability in my pelvis. Now I'm going to wrap my hands around my pelvis like this, so I know where my pelvis is in my body. I get that sense of where my body parts are. And once I salvage(ph) this position, I would like to start playing with getting heavy with my bones because I'm lying down. If I was standing up and my shoulders were forward and my neck forward I'd be like this, so now lying down, I'm allowed to lengthen the back of my neck, drop my shoulders heavy into the ground. So in this position, it's a great way to release tension in the upper body, especially in my neck and shoulders. So just by lying here, try this, just by lying here now, see if you can make your heavy, heavy shoulder blades sink right into the ground. This is going to open up your chest and open up a deep breathing into the belly because we're still breathing with the belly, opening up energy in the chest. So by holding position for let's say, three breaths, we'll find that sense of heavyness in our bones. So we'll hold position for three breaths. Good, just breathing through our noses and exhaling out our mouth, relaxing the shoulder blades heavy into the ground. Now this is just a position you can do many exercises from. One of the exercises I'm going to show you now, is using a stick. Now this dowel is, you can buy at hardware stores and it's about a dollar, dollar thirty. This is a three foot long dowel and this is, we're going to use this dowel as a tool for body awareness. So what I'm going to do now is hold the stick at the very end and place it on my thighs and before I move, I'm going to once again reestablish this connectedness of my shoulder blades into earth. Now the exercise is very simple, basically it's just raising and lowering my arms like this. I breathe in, and on the exhale I move the stick, my arms, over my head until it touches the ground above my head, then I take another breath and on the exhale I return back to the neutral position and we'll call this neutral position when the stick is here. So again, the exercise is simple. I breathe in and on the exhale I move the stick, move my arms, this is all done in the exhale and I pause. I take a breath and on the exhale once again, I'm moving my arms back to neutral. So that's the exercise. Now let's talk about what this is doing. This is really forcing you to isolate the movement, meaning really define the movement right in the rotor cuffs, your shoulder joints. If I'm planting my shoulder blades into the ground, then I cannot look like this with my chest, I can't raise my chest off the ground. Secondly, if I'm really thinking about planting my shoulder blades in the ground during this movement, I can clean out the rotor cuff from tightness which helps with the neck, which helps with the chest, the face. So what we're going to do right now, and if you don't have a stick right now, you can use a cloth, a long cloth, you can use a cloth, a piece of rope, something that you can hold and stabilize your arms. So, I'm going to show you two reps, two reps of arm exercises. It looks like this. I breathe in, exhale I move, shoulder blades are really massaging the earth and right here I pause. I take the second breath and on the exhale I move back to neutral. Once again I'm maintaining that connection of my shoulder blades to earth while I'm moving. Now I'll do it a second time. I breathe in, on the exhale I move, I breathe in and I exhale I move back to neutral position. A great stretch in itself is just holding this. And a lot of young individuals who, uh, students, uh, who wear backpacks all day tend to be rounded in their upper back, this a great way of opening up the chest and cleaning out the arms. So I breathe in and I exhale and I come back to neutral and that ends the exercise.

walking 

00:55:30
different ways of walking 

00:55:30
ball walking 

00:55:30
head in front of body 

00:55:30
head behind body 

00:55:30
upper body collapsing to one side or the other 

00:55:30
balanced walking 

00:55:35
RON RUBIO So what I'm going to show you now are basic characteristics in walking that I've noticed and observed in individuals with autism. Uh, the first one I'm going to show you is where the individual walks on the balls of their feet and it looks like this. It's kind of a bouncy kind of feeling where they're just kind of walking, kind of bouncing, body is really not grounded and it turns into something that's really unstable. The next walking I'm going to show you is where the head is way forward of the structural body and it looks like this, where the head is kind of leading the body and you're really not on top of the body. Now I'm going to show you where the head is behind the body so it looks as if the pelvis is really kind of leading the movement and I feel a lot of stress in my lower back as my body weight is behind me. And now I'm going to show you what happens when the upper body kind of dislocates from the waist and starts swerving side to side, throwing off the balance. So it kind of looks like this if I put weight on my right side, kind of like tilts, I feel a lot of tension in this hip. In teaching proper walking it's important to really feel the energy through the feet, keeping the upper body very charged. So in teaching proper walking to my students, it’s like this, really kind of pushing through my feet, having that nice energy in my chest so I’m (inaudible ) head on top of torso.

Closing 

00:57:25
RON RUBIO So, this concludes the fundamental exercises of the pathfinder mentoring. As you saw on the DVD, the exercises are very simple and very clean. What we're working on is building that core strength, that sense of oneness and core in the mind body. So take the time to learn these concepts, because in future DVDs, we'll be incorporating these ideas for more complicated exercises, but again, very simple. So in conclusion, I hope you find these exercises to be useful both in your professional and your personal life and I thank you so very much for your time.
