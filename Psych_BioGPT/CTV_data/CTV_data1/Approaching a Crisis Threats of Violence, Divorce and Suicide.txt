TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents a film by Jay Haley and Madeleine Richeport-Haley APPROACHING A CRISIS Threats of violence, divorce, and suicide 

00:00:15
Jay Haley 

00:00:40
JAY HALEY When our families are in crisis the therapist who must help them has a variety of decisions to make. They illustrate dealing with the crisis, a film of the case is shown here. The therapy took place in a one-way mirror room with the trainees of the therapist observing from behind the mirror. Because of confidentiality this film was performed by actors. However, they do not improvise, they study an edited video of the actual therapy sessions and exactly reproduce what was said and done in the therapy room. The case was this; a mother called a therapist and said she was worried about a 10-year-old son. He was behaving strangely then she wanted therapy for him. The decision was who to interview first, the child, the mother, the father or all of them. In this case, the therapist asked parents and child to come for the first interview. 

00:01:35
JEROME FORD Dexter you go to the blackboard and write your name on the board so I would never forget it, right? 

00:01:45
JAY HALEY Ordinarily a therapist would make the family comfortable and then ask about the problem that brought them here. 

00:01:55
JEROME FORD You can, you call me Jerome or you can call me Jerry. 

00:01:55
JAY HALEY This mother's distress was too extreme to be ignored. The decision is whether to focus on her distress and if so who to ask about it. 

00:02:05
JEROME FORD Are you upset? 

00:02:10
LAURIE Ah… a little not much. 

00:02:10
JEROME FORD Is your wife upset? 

00:02:10
HENRY Yes about this and other things. 

00:02:15
LAURIE Are you talking about this whole situation or… or the whole thing. I'm upset about the situation yeah. 

00:02:20
JEROME FORD Any other things Mr. Johnson. 

00:02:25
HENRY Not sure, you know there has been family problems, financial problems. I've been with three different companies in the past year that have gone out of business and it has taken all of our savings and… and my nerves. 

00:02:40
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:40
HENRY We haven't been getting along. You know, it's been a difficult time in the financial world for… for a lot of people lately and I think I maybe the cause of lot of it. I had been very upset lately and she has been nervous and my son well it, it's been difficult. I've wanted to go see some personal advice, to talk to somebody because well. When, when I need relief I, I have to drink and that's terrible. But it is good to know yourself and I want to see somebody myself. Because when you have no family, well when you have no family and you have no job, you've nothing. 

00:03:25
JAY HALEY The therapist must decide whether to pursue the husband's problems. He decides not to go into that, if he did so the focus would be more on the husband than the problem child, which is the problem they came in for. 

00:03:40
LAURIE Can we openly discuss Dexter's problem in front of him. 

00:03:40
JEROME FORD Sure. 

00:03:45
JAY HALEY There is a general decision here, should the child's problem be discussed with the whole family or privately. Although one should interview the child alone at some point, the opening discussion of the problem should be with the family since it's an expression of that family. 

00:04:00
LAURIE Dexter has a problem relating to other children his age or older. He is afraid of them. He doesn't defend himself in situations where he might get hurt or if they are gonna call him names. 

00:04:15
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:15
LAURIE And if he, if he does get hurt he doesn't wanna do anything about it. Now with smaller children, umm… he bosses them around. 

00:04:25
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:25
LAURIE And he is basically a boy and he, it's known in the neighborhood that, that he hit smaller children. Now there is this girl, there is an incident with the girl, five years old… 

00:04:40
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:45
DEXTER She is six. 

00:04:45
LAURIE Okay she is six yeah. Okay girl is six years old. I don't how much teasing she actually did to Dexter, but he wrote her this nasty letter, horrible letter and put it in their mailbox. I don't know… I did know anything about this letter. And the mother came to me, she was so upset and she said that this letter and(ph) were things written like die, die, morbid, morbid things like that written in this letter, nasty things he wrote to this little girl. Now he knows he is not suppose to hit girls, he knows that, but he… he does. 

00:05:25
JAY HALEY The description of the problem boy and therapy can be a metaphor for what is happening in the family. One might suspect from this description by the mother that there is violence in the family. When the boy is said to be violent with girls, one might wonder about the violence of father. If one assumes this a decision is whether to ask about it. If the goal is to have the husband not beat the wife, a circumspect approach is necessary. 

00:05:55
HENRY She didn't told me about this letter. I, I didn't know about this, when did this happen? 

00:06:00
LAURIE A few months ago. 

00:06:00
HENRY You should tell me about this. We should have been here long before this and I don't know maybe one letter isn't enough I don't know. But, but I do know that he wont defend himself. He has the body of a 11-year-old because he is like 4 foot 10. But you know he has been over sheltered and he has got the mind of a… of a 6-year-old and he doesn't defend himself. 

00:06:20
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:20
HENRY I, I'm trying to build a self confidence. 

00:06:25
LAURIE Okay those things have to be said right. I've seen an attorney for divorce. 

00:06:30
JEROME FORD Okay. 

00:06:30
LAURIE And umm… you know my husband what we are talking about you know Dexter's feelings of insecurity and he is feeling inferior things and I tribute a lot of what's happening with Dexter to this. I mean he… he hasn't had a father literally for nine years. 

00:06:50
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY The therapist finds himself in unexpected territory. It's not simply a child problem with the parents arguing about whether the father should do more with the child which often happens. What is serious is the mother has mentioned that she has seen an attorney for a divorce. The therapist has to know what the marital situation is before dealing with parents of the problem child. Should he immediately ask about the divorce and focus on that. Or should he let them proceed with the boys problem and father's neglect. 

00:07:25
HENRY That I've been so preoccupied with the job and… and whatever I've been trying to be so super successful when I wind up with… with nothing. But, recently I've recognized Dexter's problem and we've been spending more time together. 

00:07:40
LAURIE If he calls during the day and says he wants to go do something Dex… 

00:07:45
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:45
LAURIE Dex will say to me mommy I don't want to go. And I'll say just tell daddy you don't want to do that, but he won't. 

00:07:55
JEROME FORD Are… are you separated right now? 

00:07:55
HENRY No. 

00:07:55
LAURIE We're living together in the same house but not husband and wife. 

00:08:00
HENRY So you are not sleeping in the same bed? 

00:08:00
LAURIE No. 

00:08:05
HENRY That, that's it I'm working on it but whatever. Did, did you have a good time with me yesterday when we went to see grandfather? 

00:08:15
DEXTER Not much. 

00:08:15
HENRY You, you didn't want to go because you're tired or you just didn't want be with me. 

00:08:20
DEXTER I just didn't want to be with you. 

00:08:25
HENRY Well I, I thought you really liked me. 

00:08:30
DEXTER I do but I didn't want to go. 

00:08:30
JEROME FORD You… you… you're working you're are working very hard at. I don't… I don't know at what maybe… maybe you're working too hard? 

00:08:40
HENRY I… I could be overdoing it. I'm working on two things really, first of all is to build his confidence in himself personally. And… and second is to build a relationship with me, but you know, you know I'm overdoing it. It just hit me all of a sudden and she says she is going to a divorce… to an attorney for divorce. But… but our son is what… is what has to be done. If I put the same resources into him that I put on the job and I… I think that will be worthwhile but… but it's going to take some time. 

00:09:15
JEROME FORD You… you are gonna give me piece of that gum. Thank you two pieces, thank you. 

00:09:25
HENRY He is… he is over generous. I use to do the same thing too. I use to you know try to buy my friends, because I use to come from a broken family. But that's something you know we're are gonna solve Dexter's problem. 

00:09:40
JEROME FORD Who… who is we gonna do this? 

00:09:40
HENRY Myself and Laurie. 

00:09:40
JEROME FORD As… as mother and father. Is that… is this… is this what you want? 

00:09:45
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:09:50
JEROME FORD He is saying that he… he wants to be… be a father to his son. And… but he… he is not necessary saying that he gonna be a husband to you. 

00:10:00
LAURIE Well that's what I've always wanted is for him to have a relationship with his son regardless of what our relationship is. 

00:10:05
JEROME FORD Things are very strained right now. 

00:10:05
LAURIE Oh yeah very strained. 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY When a married couple arrives with a threat of separation, the therapist can encourage a separation or try to hold them together. It's impossible to be neutral and not influence the couple in one direction or another even if one would like to believe that every statement and body movement of the therapist exerts an influence. As more information comes in the decision might change. The therapist here defines a threat of divorce as indicating a strange relationship that mild definition implies he will try to bring them together. At this point should the therapist help couple get together or get apart. 

00:10:50
HENRY I, I've made up my mind of what has to be done I've just got to have her. I've made up my mind to that. 

00:10:55
JEROME FORD You got to have her to do what. 

00:11:00
HENRY I've just got to have her. You know, I work on my son, I'll use him as a vehicle to… to pull us together. You mean that… that way if we share something or will have something together instead of me. You know wasting my time on something stupid on the computer that will soon become obsolete or whatever. 

00:11:15
JAY HALEY The father using the boy to win back his wife is obviously an unfortunate way to deal with either son or wife. A therapist might get angry at such a father, yet the therapist must deal with the issue for the benefit of everyone. What is the best way to respond. 

00:11:35
JEROME FORD You're gonna use your son to get to your wife. 

00:11:40
HENRY I think that might, it is a little monolithic in my thinking maybe. 

00:11:45
JEROME FORD No… no… no you're not that, you're just about to mess things up. I'm not… I'm not dumping on you now, I'm just calling the actual(ph) way I see them. 

00:11:50
HENRY No I've been giving it to her straight to that doing the things that I've noted. 

00:11:55
JEROME FORD No, I don't… I don't think you have and I'll think it's been working that way. I'm asking for the both of you to make it happen beginning right now. That… that you're father to your son and… and did not use him into a husband and wife relationship. 

00:12:15
HENRY No… I didn't mean that I think I misled you there. I see her as a distinct problem and I made up my mind to be a dad. I mean it's byproduct, but you know we can share something you know her and I. You know we… we haven't shared a lot really. There are separate problems I think and that they… they have to be solved separately and I know what they are thank god. I've learned more on the past 30 years and I've ever know since you know before I was 30. 

00:12:45
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:45
HENRY Thank god fortunately. 

00:12:45
LAURIE As a matter of fact he has been talking about suicide. 

00:12:50
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:50
LAURIE And this is a very serious problem, he doesn't care about anything. He doesn't care about his job. He doesn't care about his kid. He does… not about anything. 

00:13:05
JAY HALEY The therapist expected the routine child problem and instead a more complex situation has risen. The wife has filed for divorce while living with her husband, which can be dangerous since he is drinking and threatening suicide. Both husband and wife are nervous and upset. The boys problem reflects this desperate circumstance. It seems possible that the boys difficulties cannot be solved until the issue with the husband and wife is resolved. 

00:13:35
LAURIE In making my decision it was very hard thing to do and when I finally made my decision. I put my child before myself and that's how I finally came to my decision. It's been very hard. You know I use to be the way he is now in fact I'm still pretty nervous about the whole thing. 

00:13:55
JEROME FORD Right. 

00:14:00
LAURIE But you know, you know I feel like crying and other things like that. I'm taking depression pills and tranquilizers from my doctor and that's helping me. 

00:14:20
JEROME FORD How was he? 

00:14:20
LAURIE He is talking about well I really don't want to talk about this you know in front of the child. 

00:14:30
JEROME FORD Okay, Dexter you know, he knows most of it. 

00:14:35
HENRY Don't make mismatch, do you? 

00:14:40
JEROME FORD If, if you wish it is your decision we can… we can send Dexter down to wait in the waiting room. 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY Sending the child out of the room has many consequences. When the mother says she doesn't want to talk in front of the child, the therapist has a decision to make. If a couple come in with a child problem and also bring up their marriage. The therapist would be wise to remain focused on the child and deal with the couple issues later. In this situation to send the child out of the room will make the therapy about the marriage not about the child. Here the therapist decides to leave it up to the parents. Mother chooses to send the child to the waiting room. When the child has gone mother continues. 

00:15:30
LAURIE I'm very concerned and worried about him. He talks about committing suicide and says he is going to kill himself. I had a bottle of tranquilizers and he said he took five. I didn't see him take the five he said he took. But he said he took them with some Vodka and he keeps talking about suicide and I'm very worried. I don't know if it's all acting, if he is just trying to keep us together or if he really would harm himself I don't know. 

00:16:10
JAY HALEY The therapist must now decide how to deal with the suicide threat. Should he explore it to determine how real it is enlarging the issue? Should he minimize it by trying to ignore it? Should he plan to hospitalize the man? To put him in the hospital could make him worse since what would have expected is getting a job. Not to hospitalize him could been the therapist would be liable if the man committed suicide. The therapist decides to make an unusual approach. 

00:16:40
JEROME FORD Why don't you ask him? 

00:16:45
HENRY Let me just explain the context when I took those tranquilizers. I'm not trying to rationalize or justify anything here. 

00:16:50
JEROME FORD wife just needs to ask you something. 

00:16:55
HENRY Sure. 

00:16:55
LAURIE Would you kill yourself if we got a divorce? 

00:17:00
HENRY I… I would have no positive reason. I would care less about living. 

00:17:05
LAURIE Would you commit suicide? 

00:17:10
HENRY You know, I did take those tranquilizers in the hope that I was going to get relief right away. The byproduct of that being that I slept a little longer. I think… I think it has to be crazy to say definitely I, you know that I'm going to kill myself. 

00:17:25
LAURIE Would you kill yourself? You don't have to be crazy. 

00:17:25
JAY HALEY The man is aware that if he says he will kill himself in this mental health context he might be hospitalized involuntarily. His phrasing reflects this concern. 

00:17:35
HENRY Job I would probably seek relief anyway I can probably drink too much. 

00:17:40
LAURIE You already drink too much that hasn't helped anything. 

00:17:45
HENRY Well when you're in terrible pain, even any relief you can get even it's just for a day, just for a short while you're, you're escaping it. You're getting away and if you are a coward and all that. 

00:17:55
LAURIE I know why you drink Henry. You still haven't answered my question. 

00:18:00
HENRY Yes I would like to explain the context of when I took those tranquilizers. 

00:18:05
JEROME FORD No… no… not yet… tell… tell your wife that you're not going to kill yourself. 

00:18:10
HENRY Just deteriorate. 

00:18:10
JEROME FORD Yes you want to kill yourself slowly day-by-day. 

00:18:15
LAURIE That's what he has been doing anyway. 

00:18:15
JEROME FORD Till something happens or… or begins to happen that's why you're here. So someone or somebody began, began to help more for you to put the scarce on the staying(ph). So you can handle, begin to handle some of the difficult times that you both will be going through. Like slowly, slowly down a little bit. How old are you now? 

00:18:35
HENRY 31. 

00:18:40
JEROME FORD He is 31 so… so you say… so you die when you're 71. Your husband is saying to you that he is not going to kill himself. 

00:18:45
LAURIE I don't fully believe that. I… I think he has brainwashed me into thinking like this. 

00:18:55
HENRY Last… last Saturday her sister came over to take them out and it just crushed me to have them come over and… and leave me there alone. 

00:19:05
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:05
LAURIE Henry I've filed for a divorce things are different now. Before I wanted you there I needed it, right and you were never there. 

00:19:20
HENRY You… you just convinced me that I don't know better. 

00:19:20
LAURIE This has been a repetition of my life, of our lives for the past 13 years. 

00:19:30
JEROME FORD 13 years. 

00:19:30
LAURIE We've been married 10. 

00:19:30
HENRY Ten and-a-half and there is just one thing in all that time that… that you can't bring up or else it will go on for a thousand years. It could… it could never be solved and I just reconcile myself to… to deal with it, as don't ever mention her parents. 

00:19:45
LAURIE Henry that has nothing to do with it. 

00:19:50
HENRY That reaction was enough to indicate what I mean. I mean I'm going to take 100% of the blame on this. I… I'll absorb that. 

00:20:05
JAY HALEY Obviously this marital problem involves in-laws one way to approach that would be to bring in the whole family at some point. Now to involve the larger family would not be welcome to the wife who takes the position that changes not possible and the divorce decision is made. 

00:20:20
LAURIE I feel I do not want to discuss our marital problems. I came here only to help Dexter and as far as I'm concerned I've made my decision and I'm not going to change my mind. He said he is willing to work at this and he is willing to work at that, but it is just promises like I've had for 10 years like since before we got married. 

00:20:40
JEROME FORD 10 years ago how was it then? 

00:20:45
LAURIE It wasn't good then either. I broke it off. I… I said this is it. I'm not going to get married and then what he is doing to me now is the same thing he was doing to me then. You know the crying and trying to make me feel so sorry for him. 

00:21:10
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:10
LAURIE And you know he starts, he starts his crying and he gives me all sorts of promises he probably believes he can keep. 

00:21:20
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:20
LAURIE But it's just, it's too many times. We were separated a year-and-a-half. 

00:21:30
JEROME FORD …year-and-a-half. 

00:21:30
LAURIE Almost two years. 

00:21:30
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:30
LAURIE And I go back and he makes things so rotten for me like he was punishing me for the year-and-a-half that I was away. 

00:21:45
JAY HALEY Deciding whether the couple should get together or get apart, the therapist could be influenced by the fact that the period of separation did not improve matters. 

00:21:55
HENRY Unfortunately there… there are two things that are important here, one is the… the turmoil with jobs around the time she came back. The whole financial community was starting to deteriorate… 

00:22:05
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:10
HENRY And two you know I had spent so much time in my… in my with my business life and the business world and now I've got certainly have nothing to show for them. I'm rather convinced that… that was a waste. 

00:22:20
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:25
LAURIE I said to myself before I came, oh! I'm not going to talk about this. 

00:22:30
JEROME FORD We need to get things clear for what things are and so we become crystal clear for all of us. 

00:22:40
LAURIE I guess the biggest issues is that I'm afraid of him. If I talk to him in a certain tone of voice I get a punch in the arm. If you know… you know he drinks a lot. 

00:22:50
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:55
LAURIE And he has hit me for the past 13 years even before we got married and you know one night he came home and he got a strap out of the closet. 

00:23:10
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:10
LAURIE And he started beating me with the strap. 

00:23:15
JEROME FORD How many times did he hit you? 

00:23:15
LAURIE With the strap? 

00:23:15
JEROME FORD Yes. 

00:23:15
LAURIE I couldn't tell you. 

00:23:20
HENRY Four times. 

00:23:20
LAURIE You don't know, I know. 

00:23:25
HENRY I… I've been ashamed of it ever since. 

00:23:25
LAURIE It was not four times. It was more than four times, he kept saying one more time… one more time. 

00:23:30
JEROME FORD Umm… 

00:23:30
LAURIE Anyway that's got the hell out of me. 

00:23:35
HENRY And… I'm… I'm terribly ashamed of it. 

00:23:35
LAURIE Let me finish. The next day I tried to talk to him about this and he says, you know he says it's way of exp… of expressing passion and you know to me this is sick. So the next night he comes home and he goes to the closet and he gets the strap and he says are you ready? And I said ready for what. And then I see that he has the strap and I ran as fast as I could. I don't know where I got the energy to run as fast as I did, but I ran and I had to run all the way to one of my neighbors home. And you know I don't know when he is going to come home and I don't know what condition he is going to come home in. And you know when he… when he drives up I get this pain it's horrible pain in my chest. And I get this pain in my stomach and you know you can't live like that. You know I'm… I'm really afraid of him and it's not just his drinking. He has a bad… bad temper. 

00:24:45
JAY HALEY For some therapists the episodes of violence would be enough to decide the couple should separate. The therapist making that decision would also have to prevent possible violence resulting from the separation. Other therapist might think the couple could eliminate the violence. This therapist thought in terms of first trying to hold the couple together. He talked to them about the possibility of working out issues between them, especially the violence. 

00:25:10
HENRY And I… I'm… I'm so terribly ashamed of that. 

00:25:15
JEROME FORD Ashamed uh… uh… uh… won't… won't help what really counts is doing something different. 

00:25:20
HENRY Right. 

00:25:20
LAURIE He completely dominates me, but I said, I can't even talk to him in a certain tone of voice. 

00:25:25
HENRY Well, I just… I guess, she just put me in my place. 

00:25:30
LAURIE By filing for divorce. 

00:25:30
HENRY She shocked the hell out of me going to that attorney. 

00:25:35
LAURIE Henry, we were separated a year and half. 

00:25:35
HENRY Yeah and I thought you were back for a thousand years. 

00:25:40
LAURIE You know I said, you don't leave me any alternative. I… I told him to stop the drinking and I told him to stop scaring the hell out of me and the kid. 

00:25:50
JEROME FORD How long you two not slept together? 

00:25:55
HENRY Two… two weeks. 

00:25:55
LAURIE Two weeks. 

00:25:55
JEROME FORD Not very long. 

00:25:55
JAY HALEY This information too must be considered by the therapist deciding whether or not to encourage a divorce. 

00:26:05
HENRY The important thing here is that I recognize Dexter's problem and… and that I'm working on it and… and she knows that. 

00:26:10
JEROME FORD Dexter is not here right now and I'd… I don't want to bring him in… bring him into the conversation that that's part of problem. 

00:26:15
HENRY Right. 

00:26:15
JEROME FORD I don't like for the three of us to meet umm… everyday for umm… this week and for one hour and at the end of that week when we can began to make a decision on how we're gonna handle this thing. Now, I… I don't think that you should stop doing what you're gonna do about the… the divorce, that is your decision. 

00:26:35
JAY HALEY The therapist is concerned about the possibility of saving the marriage, but he is also concerned with helping the couple separate safely. 

00:26:45
HENRY That's… that's good idea. 

00:26:45
LAURIE Well, I don't wanna give my husband false hope. I feel like I've made up my mind. 

00:26:50
HENRY Well, you know fruit for thought, how can you think about divorcing me when you're still living with me? 

00:26:55
LAURIE Still live with you, what do you mean? Where am I supposed to go until this thing is settled? 

00:27:00
JEROME FORD That… that's one of the things that we need to talk about, just those kinds of things. You know if… if you're going to go through a… a divorce or separation or you need to know how is it gonna work for the… for… for you and… and your son. 

00:27:10
LAURIE Well, I wanna do what's best for my son. 

00:27:15
JEROME FORD Uh… uh… and I wanna help him to… and I… I see your son been very caught up in all of these. 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY The therapist interviewed the couple an hour a day for the next two days. After the third interview, he felt he was not producing a change in the wife's determination to separate, despite the improvement of the couple. He was concerned about the husband's drinking environments. It was a provoking and dangers situation for the wife to threaten divorce while living in the same home with a man with a history of violence. He consulted with me about the situation. I had suggested that he see the wife alone and ask her about the divorce. If she was still determined to divorce, he should have her take her child and move out of the house that day. The therapist interviewed the wife alone to discuss this. 

00:28:05
Three Days later 

00:28:10
JEROME FORD Getting a divorce or continuing with your husband is… is really up to you. You know, we've been meeting at least for several times now. 

00:28:15
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:28:15
JEROME FORD I… I really think its time that… that… that I actually what you… what you wanna do? 

00:28:20
LAURIE Uh… my plans are the same. I'm gonna continue with the divorce. 

00:28:25
JEROME FORD So you're gonna continue with the divorce? 

00:28:25
LAURIE Yeah. Henry has been making all sorts of promises umm… promising all sorts of things and you know, I've… I've… he says that I would change my mind if I… if I do see the changes that he is making, but I really don't think that I would change my mind. 

00:28:45
JAY HALEY When the wife is firm in her decision, the therapist must help her with the separation in a way that it is best for everyone. As she gets more definite she will have doubts. For years she has been unable to leave her husband even when she wish to and even when he hit her. So, it could be expected that the separation would not occur easily. The therapist will have to hold her firm because isolation could revoke the husband and be dangerous. 

00:29:15
JEROME FORD You… you should go about the bitterness(ph) of arranging that the separation and divorce and making plans for you and your son, right? 

00:29:20
LAURIE Yes, but I'm very worried about my husband. He's been thinking positively. I… I think he really feels like we're gonna be together. 

00:29:30
JEROME FORD Well, you will be together on some things. 

00:29:35
LAURIE No, I mean… I mean is man and wife. You know what? I just don't think that… that he believes me yet and… and… I'm… I'm worried about him. 

00:29:45
JEROME FORD What do mean worried about him? 

00:29:45
LAURIE Well, I… I feel he is emotionally unstable and that he's… he's liable to hurt himself. I… I think that that he might really be capable of hurting himself. 

00:29:55
JEROME FORD Umm… what do you think you can do? 

00:30:00
LAURIE Well, I don't… I don't know what I can do. 

00:30:00
JEROME FORD Then you… you could stay with him. 

00:30:05
LAURIE As his wife? 

00:30:05
JEROME FORD Yes. 

00:30:05
LAURIE No. I couldn't… I couldn't do that at all. 

00:30:05
JEROME FORD You're not gonna do that alright, uh… this is the second major time you separate from him, right? 

00:30:10
LAURIE Hmm…hmm… 

00:30:15
JEROME FORD And this time… it really… it really looks like this is what you wanna to do. 

00:30:15
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:30:15
JEROME FORD If you stay with him Laurie, because you don't… you don't wish to hurt him and you feel sorry for him then it's gonna be rough for you. 

00:30:25
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:30:25
JEROME FORD Okay? Its gonna be almost… its almost gonna be impossible for you to stay with him that way. 

00:30:30
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:30:30
JEROME FORD Okay? To continue living with… living with… with him… when you don't really want to… that's… that's the best situation for you. 

00:30:40
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:30:40
JEROME FORD And… and… add for him. Now, you decided to get a divorce. What kind of separation did you have in mind? 

00:30:45
LAURIE A… a divorce umm… because I've done that that… the separation thing before. 

00:30:50
JEROME FORD Okay. 

00:30:55
LAURIE Yeah. 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY By commenting that she is already begun to separate and by emphasizing the finality of the separation, the therapist encourages her to move toward that goal. As she does so, she also must bring up her doubts to be resolved. 

00:31:10
LAURIE It's a funny thing, but you know when I'm out like when I'm with my sister and her husband, I really… I really miss him, you know I have all sorts of mixed feelings and you know I wish he could be there, but… but when I really start, you know to think about it seriously… 

00:31:30
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:31:30
LAURIE …I really know that it… it… it wouldn't be right, it wouldn't work out. 

00:31:35
JEROME FORD Henry want really be with you that all the way you would like uh… for Henry be with you or… or any element that to be with him… 

00:31:40
LAURI Yeah. I'd… I'd be very grateful, if you would continue helping him, you know… 

00:31:50
JEROME FORD Well, I'm not going anywhere, I'm… I'm gonna be right here with you and… and… and for your son and… and for Henry. 

00:31:55
LAURIE Okay. 

00:31:55
JEROME FORD Now… now I'm gonna ask you some and it might sound drastic, but its… its really gonna help you, alright? You… you're gonna have to pack up your things and take yourself and your son and go. 

00:32:10
LAURIE Umm… The only place I could go is to my mother and father's. 

00:32:20
JEROME FORD Right. 

00:32:20
LAURIE I thought maybe we could stay in the same house, you know until it was final and then umm… and then I… and then I could sell the house and then I would have some money to go live where I wanted to with my child. 

00:32:35
JEROME FORD Well, I don't… I don't think… I think all going to be that way. 

00:32:40
LAURIE Right. You know I… I… I think its hurting me more than its helping me umm… you know watching him, you know umm… my son Dex… Dexter has been really been resenting me a lot lately… 

00:32:55
JEROME FORD Hmm… 

00:32:55
LAURIE …he answers back… 

00:32:55
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:33:00
LAURIE …and umm… he seems to be blaming me for everything. 

00:33:00
JEROME FORD Well… well, it's… well, it's gonna be different for you, for him too, but… but lets take one thing at a time umm… you start talking about umm… the best… how best gonna be for you child and you are heaping all this on top of everything else that you're going through and I think what you're doing is just sitting as suffered to be paralyzed again and… and not able to move out of… of… of where you are, so I'll say you need to… to do one thing at a time. If… if things are going well with you umm… umm… and… and they will, if they're going well with you then they… they sure it will go well for Dexter. Uh… okay, even though he is not living physically in house with his… his father. 

00:33:45
LAURIE Right. Okay. 

00:33:45
JEROME FORD Well, if you want to pack your things and… and take Dexter to stay with you mother and father, would they take you in? 

00:33:50
LAURIE Umm… oh, yeah. 

00:33:50
JEROME FORD Okay then… then umm… I need to bring Henry up and… and talk with him, okay? 

00:33:55
LAURIE Okay. 

00:34:00
JEROME FORD Alright. 

00:34:00
JAY HALEY Who should tell the husband that his wife is moving out? The wife could do so since it was her decision or the therapist could do so since he advised her to leave. Well, wife and therapist could together present it to the husband. The decision here was to have the therapist see the husband alone and tell him. The therapist has intervened in their lives and he should take the brunt of the husband's emotional upset, which can be expected. After escorting the wife to his office, the therapist brought the husband in. He had the difficult task of telling a desperate man that is wife is not only leaving him, but moving out that day. To make the problem more difficult, the husband entered cheerfully still believing things were going to workout. 

00:34:45
HENRY Yeah, I appreciate your staying till after 5 o'clock. 

00:34:50
JEROME FORD That's okay. It's my job to do this. Umm… I'm… I'm concerned about your wife and about you and your son. I'm… I'm… I'm very concerned about how your wife is feeling. 

00:35:00
HENRY Sure. 

00:35:05
JEROME FORD Together tomorrow uh… to talk over some of these things, right? And… and your wife has really made up her mind that… that she wants to leave. 

00:35:10
HENRY The house? 

00:35:15
JEROME FORD Yes. 

00:35:15
HENRY Our kid? Can I… can I stand up here? I'm… oh! I really upset. You… you mean leave the house? 

00:35:25
JEROME FORD Yes. 

00:35:25
HENRY But before the divorce is over, you… you mean leave the house, yep. Anyway I'll just sit down. 

00:35:30
JEROME FORD What… what… what Henry she has… she has left the house before, right? 

00:35:35
HENRY Yeah, but I… but I understood that, but this time it would be my fault and it would be the end. But did she really says she is gonna leave the house too? 

00:35:45
JAY HALEY The therapist must ultimately admit to the husband that he advised the wife to leave that day, besides the personal reluctance to tell him, the therapist can be concerned about antagonizing the man so that he leaves. He would then lose what support he had from the therapist. 

00:36:00
JEROME FORD Your wife has filed for divorce. 

00:36:00
HENRY Yeah, yeah that I know and that could dropped within three months, if I just tell her what I'm gonna do and I intend to do that. I mean I've already made some decisions. Those decisions are made and if I have the right support, I'll do that. I… I can do those things; I've made up my mind to that. But, did… did she really gonna say she is gonna leave the house before the divorce is over? 

00:36:25
JEROME FORD She said it will make her feel better. 

00:36:25
HENRY Oh, god. Oh, god if she left the house, oh god. 

00:36:35
JEROME FORD You had to let me finish. 

00:36:35
HENRY Oh, you have to say it fast. 

00:36:40
JEROME FORD How can I say fast. 

00:36:40
HENRY I can't… 

00:36:40
JEROME FORD I can't say it fast. 

00:36:40
HENRY I'm sorry. I'm just you know… 

00:36:45
JEROME FORD I need to say this to you. Before you go off and see all kinds of things and figure all kinds of things, alright? 

00:36:50
HENRY Alright. 

00:36:50
JEROME FORD You need to listen uh… take it on the chain, but not… not fill as though it was the end of the world. 

00:36:55
HENRY Can I stand? 

00:36:55
JEROME FORD You can stand and you can… and you can walk around. 

00:37:00
HENRY See, if… if she looks the way things are now, they're bad. 

00:37:00
JEROME FORD And I'm glad you said that. 

00:37:00
HENRY Yeah, but they… but they are better in the last couple of weeks. And if I have time just to prove to her… 

00:37:05
JEROME FORD And that's good, you sounding better. 

00:37:10
HENRY Yeah, prove those things toward the things that I'm gonna do then… 

00:37:10
JEROME FORD That's… that's good. 

00:37:10
HENRY …and you know she's got to made. 

00:37:15
JEROME FORD That… that… that's good… that's good. 

00:37:15
HENRY Yes, she got it made. 

00:37:15
JEROME FORD Right, right. 

00:37:15
HENRY But I need her to be there. I'll… I'll do that for her, but I just… I just need her to be there… I need her support… 

00:37:20
JEROME FORD That's… that's good. That's a good position for you to be thinking off right now. 

00:37:25
HENRY …well I need her to help me. 

00:37:25
JEROME FORD Well, but she needs to have some room between you, okay? 

00:37:30
HENRY Does she wants to go to her mother's? 

00:37:35
JEROME FORD Well, look. She needs to tell you about the arrangements that she would be making… 

00:37:40
HENRY See, I don't have any money right now to go out on my own, you know I mean, in fact they cut off our electricity today and then the jobs, I mean there's… there's no money for salaries and this is like on… on… on top of the worst thing that could happen to a guy right now. You know, I mean when she is not there, I'm in bad shape. You know, I just… I… I need to go out and drink just to be around people, you know, but you know… I… I think she is wrong there. We need… we need to work this out together. 

00:38:10
JEROME FORD You know, I… I… I agree to that… that you need to solve this problem together. 

00:38:15
HENRY Right, right. Uh… You know I… I feel like I'm in an elevator and the doors and doors have just shut you know I'm on… I'm on the 21st floor, I'm all alone… 

00:38:25
JEROME FORD Hmm…hmm… 

00:38:25
HENRY …and there… and they're all gone and… I'm actually like having a phobia here, you know like… frightened to death. 

00:38:35
JEROME FORD Talk like that I'm out in here… in here Henry, I'm here. 

00:38:40
HENRY Yeah, well, you know I appreciate what you're trying to do for me here. 

00:38:40
JEROME FORD Look… look your wife has decided that she wants to… to leave because it'll make her feel better. 

00:38:50
HENRY Yeah. Well, I'll give her as much room in the house as she wants. 

00:38:50
JEROME FORD Well that… that… that… that's… that's not the way its gonna work this time. Henry uh… wife wants to leave. 

00:39:00
HENRY Oh, god I don't… I don't know how I'm gonna survive this, but that's my problem. Did… did she… did she already go? 

00:39:05
JEROME FORD I'm gonna go… I'm gonna go and get your wife and then I… 

00:39:10
HENRY This is… this is like the worst thing that could happen to me right now, you know I don't have any other alternatives. 

00:39:15
JEROME FORD But we're going to be together tomorrow and we'll talk about the decisions there. 

00:39:20
HENRY Did… did she say when she was gonna do this? 

00:39:20
JEROME FORD I… I suggested to her that she do this as soon as possible because it would make her feel better. 

00:39:25
HENRY Okay, but I've got to have some support, you know. 

00:39:30
JEROME FORD Well, uh… I'm here for you. 

00:39:30
HENRY Yeah, but you know… but what about the other 24-hour? In 23 hours of the day when its really you know when it's… when its real, when its all that… I… I'm being a cry maybe just… just forgive me, would you? 

00:39:45
JEROME FORD This is like easy for anybody. 

00:39:50
HENRY Yeah, but I know other people works things out. 

00:39:50
JEROME FORD Henry we… we're not… we're talking about other people, we're talking about you this is gonna be a rough time for you. 

00:39:55
HENRY You know I'll give her, just as long as she stays I'll give her as much room in… in the house as she wants, as much as she needs, so long as she is there. 

00:40:05
JEROME FORD That… that maybe the way you wanted Henry, but… 

00:40:05
HENRY I just haven't really thought about it. 

00:40:10
JEROME FORD Well, what do you mean? 

00:40:10
HENRY Yeah, I thought about what it be like to be without her you know I… I would have a loss of her and a loss of the job, loss of the house and you know I wouldn't even be able to think… think straight to get a job and then… and then I'm just, I'll be nothing. I'd be nothing. 

00:40:25
JEROME FORD Well, you… you… you have me Henry, I'm… I'm here for you and we're gonna work this out. You know, we can do this. 

00:40:35
HENRY Yeah, but… you know I'm a… I'm a 24-hour day kind of guy. You know I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but you know and I… and I like you as a person. My wife knows that. But, but you know if that happens, I just don't know, I just think… I… I just think that that might just be more than of what I can handle. 

00:40:55
JEROME FORD I'll get your wife, Henry. I've… I've told Henry about the decision that… that you made about getting the distance of the room between both of you, for the time being. I'm not sure of how long you wanna do this or how its gonna be, that appears on all the things. 

00:41:20
HENRY I don't… I don't know how you know… well, you know forgive me, but I don't… when that happens, I don't know. I just don't have any answer for that. 

00:41:30
JEROME FORD You don't have a answer to what Henry? 

00:41:35
HENRY You know I… I can do without her sex, I… I can give you more room in the house just be there, you know somebody to come home to. 

00:41:45
JEROME FORD Okay. Can you tell Henry umm… where you are gonna be? 

00:41:50
LAURIE At my father's. 

00:41:50
HENRY I don't want your pity, I want your love. I mean my alternatives, you know I don't have any. 

00:42:00
JEROME FORD Okay… okay… okay, you do have one you know? 

00:42:00
HENRY What's that? 

00:42:05
JEROME FORD There's some distance between you and… and she is… and she is living in… in a separate place somewhere else for a while and… and then that you know how to reach her. 

00:42:15
HENRY You know that's not solving the problem, that's what running away from the problem, that's not giving me a chance. That's not fixing it and that's ending it. 

00:42:20
LAURIE Henry, I thought that we could live in the same house until it was finished, but we just can't do that. 

00:42:30
HENRY And why not? 

00:42:30
LAURIE Because its… its like a mother who has to like go after children. You know umm… I mean seeing you like this all the time, its getting harder and harder for me, but this morning it was a very weak time for me, you… you came down and you're hugging me and I found myself hugging back, you know I have feelings and when you leave and then I think about it and I know its not right. I need to be loved. 

00:43:05
HENRY I… I… I think that what you're saying is that you plan on going through with the divorce, but you… but you're gonna see it through at your parent's house. And then you're gonna leave the house, you're gonna be gone, you're gonna sell the house and you're gonna give me my piece of it which I could care less about and then your life is gonna start two seconds after you leave and you're just trying to leave me with some false hope, just… just to keep me hanging on. 

00:43:30
JEROME FORD You know you're luring on her Henry. 

00:43:35
HENRY I don't think so. 

00:43:35
JEROME FORD Whether your intension is to ah… to give Henry no… no… no sign of hope. I really don't know what you meant by that? 

00:43:45
HENRY No… no chance for… for reconciliation, you know what the divorce could drop dead before it even starts. 

00:43:50
JEROME FORD Umm… Laurie, is… is there a chance that… that… that somewhat that you… you two can reconcile and get through this? 

00:44:00
LAURIE I don't really believe that he would change. 

00:44:00
JEROME FORD What you're saying is… is… is that he needs to… to demonstrate in a long period of time uh… uh… some change. 

00:44:10
LAURIE Yeah, over a long period of time. 

00:44:15
HENRY What kind of demonstration? I mean, you mean… you mean over a long period of time, you know after the divorce is over, after that house and all that, what'll end it… what'll end it before the divorce, you know if you stay at your mother's, what you expect me to do? 

00:44:30
LAURIE Well, you still have Dexter to think about. 

00:44:30
HENRY No, that's not enough. 

00:44:35
JEROME FORD Okay. You can feel in the way you want, but you still have Dexter. 

00:44:35
HENRY That's not enough. 

00:44:40
JEROME FORD Well, two days ago, you… you were… you were really to do things with the boy and demonstrate how you wanna be a father, which… for which uh… this is what she want. 

00:44:45
HENRY Yeah that was a separate problem, you know and I… and I… I was gonna do that, I… I was doing that, but I… I can't even think about doing it now, you know with… with you not in the house and me coming around to pick him up, you know I… I just can't see passed(ph) you. 

00:45:05
LAURIE So what you're saying is once I'm out of the house its dead for you too, you don't care about Dex at all. 

00:45:10
HENRY You know I'm… I'm not playing on your sympathies here, you know but I know that once you're gone, you're gonna get the divorce and the house is gonna be gone and the child and all of that and I'm not gonna care about anything, I can't see passed(ph) you at all. That's the end of it. I was gonna ask you for a professional help, you know for… for tranquilizers or whatever. And I would do that, but with her. You know, I would do that with her together. I've stopped drinking right now, tomorrow… tomorrow if… if I had a reason, but I need something. I got to have something, I need some relief. 

00:46:05
JEROME FORD Okay, okay. Now, your Laurie is saying that its not just your problem, Henry. You have to make some adjustments, she is gonna have to make some adjustments. Your son is fine looking boy and he's… he's going to need uh… umm… he's going to need to have you there. Your wife is… is feeling too that… that you're an important guy and that your environment with your son, Dexter is really necessary. What I'm… what I'm suggesting to you Henry is that… that you don't do anything, you… you just you don't drink or you don't take anymore of your pills and… and that Laurie is that you pack your bags and go over to your… your mother's house. 

00:46:45
HENRY I don't think that you're being very fair to me. I say for two stinking months and you… and you can cut up the sex. I'm asking for… for our child's sake, not for my own sake that starting from right now. Cut up the drinking, I'll cut up all that, just knowing you're there and I've got it made. 

00:47:15
JAY HALEY The therapist task is to hold the wife in her position while the husband is being so persuasive. 

00:47:20
HENRY And… and I promise you there would be no… no drinking and I had preferred to cut off the drugs too, but you just give me that two months and I think you've done right by everybody. Our marriage is destroyed, the house is gone, the child is gone, the job is gone, I… I guarantee that. Be owe to yourself, you know that you owe to the family, you owe to the child, its you… you owe it to me, you know I… I think that… that you owe it to god.

JEROME FORD Now, he… he's really loudness on you now. 

00:48:05
HENRY See, I don't… is that only because I don't have any other alternative. 

00:48:05
JEROME FORD The alternative is Henry that you take care of the son as a father should and that you try to win back your wife and I could tell you to come here and so, I can help you with this. That's the alternative. 

00:48:20
HENRY See, I don't know. I just can't do that. 

00:48:20
LAURIE That's how I wanted Henry. 

00:48:25
HENRY I'm sorry, I'm just not capable. 

00:48:25
LAURIE Well, why not? Doesn't your son mean anything to you? 

00:48:30
HENRY I'm gonna become a mess. Now, I'm playing on your sympathies I know that… and that stinks. But you asked me how I feel and that's it.

JAY HALEY The interview ended with the wife leaving to pack and go with her child to her parent's home. The therapist talked with the man for a while. The dilemma for the therapist is what to do with this man for that night. The man is threatening suicide, has been abandoned by his wife. He is losing his job and he must go home alone to an empty house with the electricity turned off. The man had no friends or family in the area to turn to. The decisions of the therapist might range from professional to personal actions. The therapist could telephone him that evening and make sure he was alright or he could try to get them into a hospital as a suicidal risk. Instead, the therapist did something controversial; he went out drinking with the man that night. The next morning, he met with the more cheerful couple.

JEROME FORD Henry is a very interesting person, I felt very comfortable with him. 

00:49:50
