BASIC LISTENING SEQUENCE HODGES GLENN ~ ALLEN IVEY 

00:00:00
ALLEN IVEY  In this next tape, well, Hodges Glenn and I are going to do a demonstration of the basic listening sequence but I'm going to try to do on tape is start by asking an open question followed by a close question perhaps, and then an encourage, then I wanna paraphrase, then I wanna reflect feeling, and then I wanna summarize. And possibly after summarize, summary, I might ask for a specific example but I'm going to go through the basic listening sequence in order. I want to demonstrate that ah, the skills can be used with reasonably good effect in a sequential basis. And we'll talk about the value of this a little bit later. 

00:00:50
THE BLS SEQUENCE of SKILLS OPEN QUESTION - "COULD" 

00:00:50
ALLEN IVEY  Hodges, could, could you tell me how things are going for you on your dissertation? 

00:01:00
HODGES GLENN Well, pretty rough right now. 

00:01:05
ENCOURAGE 

00:01:05
ALLEN IVEY Pretty rough? 

00:01:05
HODGES GLENN Yeah. I'm, ah, I'm at the final stage where some minor corrections need to be made and the university has this book of standards which require that the... (crosstalk) 

00:01:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:01:25
HODGES GLENN ...dissertation be in a specific format before uhm, turning it in. 

00:01:30
PARAPHRASE 

00:01:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So you're getting at that final stage and you just about wind, wind up. 

00:01:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
ALLEN IVEY Would you go on? 

00:01:35
HODGES GLENN Yeah. Well, the, the frustration is there's all to these picky details. My response is, "What difference does it make?" Uhm, the content has been approved and it's been signed off by the department and by the graduate school but before I can actually be awarded the degree, I have to make sure it's in this particular format for the graduate school to accept it, then. (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
REFLECTION OF FEELING 

00:02:10
ALLEN IVEY You sound like you're a little bit frustrated, maybe, I think, a little bit angry, 

00:02:10
HODGES GLENN  Yes, I am. (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
ALLEN IVEY is that right? (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
HODGES GLENN Right. Because it's, it's a very time-consuming process and a very ah, resource intensive process requires that (coughs). I spent a lot of time in front of the computer, making sure that the format changes are correct and a certain type of paper needs to be used with a certain type of printer. I mean, it's just very specific details. 

00:02:40
SUMMARY WITH CHECK-OUT FOR ACCURACY 

00:02:40
ALLEN IVEY Now let's see if I've got this correct. So, so I've heard you say that comin' down this final stage of the dissertation, (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:02:45
ALLEN IVEY you're running into the university bureaucracy nitty-gritty, gotta meet this specific require, requirement, and so forth, and a new one comes up now and then, it's that right? (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:02:55
ALLEN IVEY It leaves you feeling kinda frustrated, sometimes a little angry, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:03:00
ALLEN IVEY have I heard you correctly? 

00:03:00
HODGES GLENN Yes. Uh hmm. 

00:03:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And that is the basic listening sequence. Ah, if you ask an open question, encourage around keywords the client uses, paraphrase back what he said, search for the feelings, and summarize the situation. You can go through and get a pretty quick map of what a person is feeling. And I think the basic listening sequence used in order at times actually can be useful. I wouldn't recommend using it as a template or a map but having the ability to use the skills in a natural flowing way can really make the difference. 

00:03:30
THE BLS IN AN INTERVIEW REACTIONS TO BEING HELD HOSTAGE 

00:03:30
ALLEN IVEY  In this tape, we'll gonna demonstrate the basic listening sequence again in a more naturalistic interview. Again, I'm going to focus on the basic listening sequence. The clients need to tell us their stories. For example if ah, if, if you've been to a hospital, you come back, you need to tell the story of the trauma. Several times in effect to wear it away. Ah, listening to client's stories is a really critical part in the therapeutic counseling process. In this tape, Hodges has told the story before, it's always helpful to tell a difficult story again 'coz that helps us cope with and make sense of making meaning our old experiences. Hodges was taking hostage in a prison situation. I think you'll find this next tape very interesting and helpful. 

00:04:25
SUMMARY AND OPEN QUESTION 

00:04:25
ALLEN IVEY  Hodges, ah, what I'd like to do is a basic listening sequence again, and of course as you well know, you finished your dissertation, went on, and ah, one of the jobs that you've worked in after that was in a prison. And you have one of the things happened that reveals ah, something that I, everybody fears. While working in a prison, you were taken hostage by a prisoner. And I was wondering, could you tell us a little bit about that experience and what it meant for you? 

00:04:55
HODGES GLENN Sure. The, it's a re, very unique experience and I hope I never have to go through it again. I was in the process of providing treatment but one of the inmates and the session escalated in terms of his threat for violence, and he has a history of violence. Ah, he decided that it was important that he take me as hostage to prove his point, to get what he thought he needed. 

00:05:25
ENCOURAGE 

00:05:25
ALLEN IVEY Tsk, so he took you as hostage to get what he needed? 

00:05:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Yes. Uhm, it was very frightening for me. I'd heard about situations like this, you know, read about other individuals but to experience it yourself, myself, was quite unique and to this day, I'm still, ah, I'm still affected by it. 

00:06:00
PARAPHRASE AND ENCOURAGE 

00:06:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So what you're saying is that you're still affected by it and looking back from the situation of being taken hostage. Okay, let's go on a bit more? 

00:06:10
HODGES GLENN Sure. Uhm, ah, what, what would you like me to, to talk about in reference to it? I'd, I, I'm not sure where you want me to, to go with that. 

00:06:30
ALLEN IVEY  Okay, so what I've heard so far is that you were taken hostage ah, it escalated, (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
SUMMARY, REFLECTION OF FEELING, AND ENCOURAGE 

00:06:45
ALLEN IVEY there was a threat for violence, and ah, I heard you say that you were terrified and it's still with you today. Uhm, I think ah, the basic listening sequence is kinda been lost. Ah, but let's stay with it and see what happens. Uhm, I think I got the feeling, in terms of feelings, I heard that feeling of frightening. Ah, did you go a little further with, with what, what you felt during that experience? 

00:07:10
HODGES GLENN Well, if I can use some metaphors. Ah, I thought of a child being locked in a, a room by... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
HODGES GLENN ...him or herself ah, with no way out. Uhm, there was a feeling of pressure because there were people coming to my aide and in some way, they were also looking to me for direction in terms of... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
HODGES GLENN ...ah, when to move or not to move ah. 

00:07:50
PARAPHRASE 

00:07:50
ALLEN IVEY So you were locked in the room, an aide, needing help and yet, (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
HODGES GLENN True. 

00:07:55
ALLEN IVEY you were still into your command of the situation and the people outside... 

00:07:55
HODGES GLENN  Yes. 

00:08:00
ALLEN IVEY ...were following your orders... 

00:08:00
HODGES GLENN Yes. 

00:08:00
ALLEN IVEY ...in difficult position. 

00:08:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
ALLEN IVEY  And then what happened? 

00:08:05
ENCOURAGE, OPEN QUESTION 

00:08:05
HODGES GLENN Well, ah, the individuals who were responsible for leading that team came forward and worked with other clinical staff members who... (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
HODGES GLENN ...began to appear and two particular individuals worked with that yeah, chief so to speak in assisting ah, communication with the inmate to get him, to release me. At that point, I felt more neutralized... 

00:08:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:08:35
HODGES GLENN  whereby uhm, I was clearly in the hands of others making decisions which was affecting the situation and my life. 

00:08:50
PARAPHRASE, REFLECTING OF FEELING 

00:08:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So your life was really on the line. Could you go back inside that room, and ah, you said that you still have some feeling- 

00:08:55
OPEN QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON IMAGES 

00:08:55
ALLEN IVEY - from that even now? 

00:09:00
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
ALLEN IVEY Could you sort of go back inside that room? Give me some of the images and things that stand out for you? Could you think of now? 

00:09:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Well, what I remember most is when the particular inmate made it clear to me that he was threatening my life and at that point, I thought of not what, I didn't think about it then, it was more after the effect(ph). Nonverbal communication, nonverbal ah, skill training, micro-training. We were, by virtue of ah, number of events that taking place in the office, we're about six inches apart and he looked me right in the eye, gave me very clear defiant eye contact that, "If he didn't get his way, he was going to kill me." Uhm, and I thought about what he's sayin' but the message was more in terms of nonverbally what he was saying: the eye contact, the body language that he felt like he was backed against the wall and this was his stand and if necessary, he was going to make it using me as his example. Uhm, so that was a very powerful image for me that even now, it's the ultimate. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
OPEN QUESTION FOCUSING ON FEELINGS 

00:10:20
ALLEN IVEY What was going on inside you, or even now, as you're talking about it? 

00:10:20
HODGES GLENN  Well, there was ah, at that time, I was somewhat like awe, like this kinda things really happen, and then ah, trying to maintain a sense of composure and not let ah, I've heard the saying, "Not let him see me sweat," uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
REFLECTING OF FEELING 

00:10:45
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. So feeling immense feelings inside of all? 

00:10:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
ALLEN IVEY And you're realizing that you really couldn't share the feelings that you have. 

00:10:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. And what I try to do was uhm, interpret his anger but at that point, I even felt like there was a point of no return with him and me that there needed to be an outside intervention. 

00:11:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:10
HODGES GLENN  Uhm, I really didn't think about losing my life at that time but when it was over, I went to a number of debriefings with professional staff and ah, it became apparent to me that may videotaped the incident to, that the situation was real and I had actually lived through ah, a terrorist encounter. 

00:11:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:45
HODGES GLENN And then the feelings began to surface. 

00:11:50
ALLEN IVEY So the feelings were held back and then,- 

00:11:50
REFLECTING OF FEELING, OPEN QUESTION 

00:11:50
ALLEN IVEY - it began to surface. Would you like to share these or would you rather not share the feelings that began to surface? (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
HODGES GLENN Uhm, I notice even now there's a real, ah, a real guardedness around the feelings I am because afterwards, it was like a personal vulnerability... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
HODGES GLENN ...or, or like a secret, uhm, yeah, a secret door... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
HODGES GLENN ...that I always thought it was close, that when all of the events or all the circumstances around the event had settled that I realized that this particular door which I think is my fear... (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
HODGES GLENN ...ah, was unlocked and I, would have to deal with it myself. And I notice now that there is a, a real sense trying to ah, keep that door locked because I think it brought me to my own personal ah, fallibility or vulnerability and I didn't particularly like that. So, ah, I feel like it's better off close. (laughs) 

00:13:00
SUMMARY 

00:13:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So that one of the ways you found for yourself is still affecting you now... (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:13:05
ALLEN IVEY ...and you've made decisions sort of to keep that door closed... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
ALLEN IVEY ...and ah, to talk about and that you really don't wanna go back and really, really experiencing that was up again. 

00:13:15
HODGES GLENN No, I'd find that I can speak very academically about it. 

00:13:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:20
HODGES GLENN Uhm, and that by being there, I know it exist and I have to deal with it. 

00:13:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:13:30
HODGES GLENN But I try, and maybe I'm thinking that it's part of my own acculturation, of my own values, and partly ah, (chuckles) my values in which ah, my ethnicity and, and, and how I'm supposed to handle ah, situations that, can be interpreted as, ah, life-threatening, (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
HODGES GLENN that I maintain a certain amount of, ah, of ah, control. 

00:14:00
SUMMARY 

00:14:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, and to let go and to share some of those things or really get back to those feelings, it would be letting go of some of those control, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
HODGES GLENN Yeah, exactly. 

00:14:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay, I'm going to pick up the chair with the slight bit of noise, and come over here beside you, 

00:14:10
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:14:10
ALLEN IVEY and ah, ask you just to share your experience of, ah, ah, of the structure(ph) as to how to demonstrate the basic listening sequence. I stayed with the, with the listening skills, (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:14:25
ALLEN IVEY a certain longer that ah, share your story... (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:14:25
ALLEN IVEY ...and what, what, ah, what was your experience of our session, Hodges? 

00:14:30
HODGES GLENN (chuckles) Well, I found the listening sequences effective when we went and began to talk more about the specific of my situation. I noticed that was closing up of... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
HODGES GLENN ...becoming more tight and then can, I can see me interpreting as being in control. And I think it would, it's because ah, that experience really opened a real vulnerable part of me and I think also I kinda feel like I don't understand... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
HODGES GLENN ...because the situation was so ah, intensely volatile... 

00:15:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
HODGES GLENN ...that it could've went in any direction. I could have been hurt, the individual that was holding the hostage could've been hurt some of the ah, staff members, and ah, they have special team des... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
HODGES GLENN ...designed to come and help ah, diffuse... (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
HODGES GLENN ...situations like that. Then a number of things could've happened and as it turned out, no one was really hurt. 

00:15:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:30
HODGES GLENN Uhm, that I just feel like oh, why or why not? I guess some of those questions I still haven't been able to answer yet. 

00:15:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
HODGES GLENN  So, (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
HODGES GLENN a part of me is just trying to protect myself... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
HODGES GLENN ...still from those feelings. 

00:15:50
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. There's a piece ah, that I think is useful ah, because we all, as counselors and therapists, we work through, with people, and you've worked for, certainly for a lot of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and then you really get yourself in a, (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
ALLEN IVEY a situation very much like this. And I'm sure you got a whole new understanding... 

00:16:10
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
ALLEN IVEY ...of those issues and the difficulty of getting to those things. Ah, for people that might be looking at this tape, ah, I give you my sense and I'd like your aura sense. I just, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
ALLEN IVEY what is that, ah, I appreciated and basically so honored by what you are sharing. At the same time, I found myself saying, "How far does Hodges wanna share?" 

00:16:35
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
ALLEN IVEY And it's a very difficult issue. I felt if I push you too far, 

00:16:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
ALLEN IVEY and that you might have, I just or, could you kinda give your opinion, your honest opinion of "where I was a little bit helpful" and where you might have felt like not have, like not have been helpful in that tape? 

00:16:50
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Well, ah, in terms of help or helping me, I found the process helpful, (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
HODGES GLENN useful. I didn't interpret any of it in terms of being more or less helpful, I was thinking of it in terms of "am I ready to, to open up... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
HODGES GLENN ...once again," something that uhm, I have, in my own way, tried to deal with and, and to deal with professionally in that setting. (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
HODGES GLENN Uhm, that's how I... (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
HODGES GLENN  looked at it. 

00:17:35
ALLEN IVEY In terms of places I already found might have been little off-centered and do you have anything come in your mind? 

00:17:35
HODGES GLENN  No, not. No, not at all in terms of being off-centered. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
HODGES GLENN No, it was just if anything, it's my, my own agenda, my own Renaissance about... (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
HODGES GLENN ...how much I'm going to, ah, so to speak, put myself back in that position again... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:17:55
HODGES GLENN ...whether it'd be through fantasy, through ah, redramatization... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
HODGES GLENN ...or which I hope it never happens being in that situation. 

00:18:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:05
HODGES GLENN I've learned a lot of things, having gone through it. 

00:18:10
ALLEN IVEY Yeah.. 

00:18:10
HODGES GLENN And ah, I hope no one ever has to go through it and those who do, I have some understanding why. 

00:18:15
ALLEN IVEY Alright. Now, given in your own experience and the fact that you work for people, that's pretty, I want to say it's really kind of multicultural part of the society. I do see people who gone through... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:25
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, trauma hostage situations... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
ALLEN IVEY ...in Vietnam. Ah, think about rape and other extreme situations 'coz if you do get this, in fact, I get that in, ah, ah, from my perspective... (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
HODGES GLENN Uh-huh. 

00:18:35
ALLEN IVEY ...very nice and ah, the locked door that, (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY of sense of vulnerability that you never had it before... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY ...or is expressed something out. I'm sure you've heard from some of your own clients. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
ALLEN IVEY Ah, do you have any observations in terms of general advise and so forth of, 'coz, well, the stories that certain people will bring our stories a trauma... (crosstalk) 

00:18:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
ALLEN IVEY ...and your own personal experience in working with other people? 

00:18:55
HODGES GLENN Uh hmm. Well, one of the things I would recommend to any therapist or counselor working with individuals with their type of presenting issue and that is to be very cognizant of the pacing and where that client is at, uhm, if they're not in the position emotionally to share our, our, the deal with those feelings, then ah, I think he would be more prudent to kinda, to ah, respect that and work with the client until they are ready. (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
HODGES GLENN Ah, I know, there are various clinical techniques to address it but ah, I just would caution any therapist... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
HODGES GLENN ...to be aware of that, (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
HODGES GLENN understand. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY In effect, listen before you leap into... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
HODGES GLENN Right. 

00:19:55
ALLEN IVEY ...lots of actions with, with relation, let the person over there... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:20:00
ALLEN IVEY ...set, set the paces. 

00:20:00
HODGES GLENN Hmm. 

00:20:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, is that it? 

00:20:00
HODGES GLENN  Yeah, that, (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:20:05
HODGES GLENN really nice, to be frank. 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay, let's take a short break and then Hodges will run through the basic listening sequence with me. 

00:20:10
HODGES GLENN Okay. (laughs) 

00:20:10
BLS IN THE INTERVIEW: CLIENT REACTIONS TO PHYSICAL ILLNESS 

00:20:10
ALLEN IVEY  In this next tape, ah, Hodges is going to talk to me about a physical illness that troubles me from time to time. As I said earlier in this tape, ah, it's important to have clients to tell their stories. And you, as a counselor or therapist, need to help clients, encourage them to tell their stories about issues that they feel are important to them. Some stories need to be told many times. The telling of the story helps wear away some of the emotional feelings and the idea of sharing your experience with an understanding person who really helps, ah, in fact, deal with trauma, physical issues. For example, if you're working with a cancer survivor, a person whose been through a heart attack. They need to tell you their stories often and layer concrete detail. I hope you'd be able to sit there and listen to these stories several times, 'cause the next people not only need to tell you their stories, sometimes they need to tell you the same stories over and over and over. A paraphrasing, encouraging, reflection of feeling, and specially that summarization skill, particularly helpful in building a sense of completion around various issues. If there isn't a sense of completion, there is a sense of support, and I think that you can develop by using the basic listening sequence. 

00:21:30
HODGES GLENN  Hello, Allen.
