Counseling Military Families: Deployment, Co-Morbidity, and PTSD with Joshua Taylor Psy.D. 

00:00:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Military families continue to be an unserved and underserved group. They have unique characteristics that we're going to explore in this video that will help you as the clinician understand how to identify and work with a military family. Domestic violence, substance abuse, gambling, pornography, infidelity. All of these issues are really specific to military families. Here are several issues that are specific to military families: domestic violence, alcohol abuse, gambling, pornography, infidelity. We see these issues on the rise within military families today. So, if you're unfamiliar with these issues, it's important that you become familiar with them to best treat the military family. A very common issue with veterans coming back into the family after they have been deployed is they come back, and now they are faced with the situation where the family has adapted to them being gone. The wife, the spouse, the fiance, the girlfriend, they have adapted. They have started to change the oil, to take out the trash. Now, all of a sudden, when the veteran comes back, they're unsure of where their place is. They're unsure of their identity within the family unit because they haven't been needed for six months. And so it's really important to identify these issues and really work on strategies that strengthen that family and allow that person to reintegrate into their role, whether it's as a father or as a mother, as a provider. Something as simple as taking out the trash can be very powerful for someone who's been away from home for six months or a year. The young veteran gets into basic training. They're in a relationship, and they have a child. And then all of a sudden they're deployed. And so they're deployed, and they come back to this child who now is maybe one years old or two years old, and they've never met them. They've never had an opportunity to bond. That's a really huge issue for a lot of young veterans. They get involved in these relationships. They go off to war. And they come back, and there's this whole family now that they're being looked at and expected to integrate into. And they don't know how. They know the military. They know their unit. They know how to be in combat. They don't know how to be a dad. They don't know how to be a mom. They may not even know how to be a spouse. And these are the issues that these military families are facing. It's very common for veterans to come home and be unsure of their role within the family because they haven't been there. So now, the caregiver, while they have been gone, has assumed the role of the one disciplining, the one making meals, the one doing all of the transportation. And it can be very unsettling for a veteran to come back and not understand their role. Another thing that's very common is a lot of veterans are very structured in terms of where they're at in combat and can have a hard time reintegrating into civilian life. They may not understand or fit or feel comfortable reintegrating into that civilian role, particularly now when the economy is so bad. We see a lot of military veterans winding up homeless because there's no jobs. And so, coming from an environment where they are the leader, they're in charge of millions of dollars worth of equipment. They're in charge of other people's lives. And now, they come home, and they're unable to provide for their family. That's depressing. We see a lot of depression in military families. And because it's so much a part of the culture, a lot of veterans will use alcohol to manage their depression. And so, I think it's really important that if you're working with military families, you have to screen for co-occuring disorders and substance abuse. It's extremely important. Remember that the veteran has spent six months, a year, maybe even longer in an environment where everything is chaotic. They may be under threat of death. They may have seen their friends or coworkers killed or maimed. And now they come back into society, and they have to reintegrate into a family. Maybe it's a family that they don't even know. That's going to be very challenging for a lot of these individuals. We have to do a lot of education to the families as well as to the veteran, and help them understand some of those challenges and barriers that really go into reintegration. How to relax. How to spend time with the family. How to become comfortable with large crowds. How to be comfortable driving on the freeway. All of these things are unique to this current conflict in veterans that are coming back. We have to work to really help them reintegrate into their lives here as members of our community. We're seeing an increase in gambling addiction and internet pornography and infidelity within the context of family therapy. So again, if you're unfamiliar with these areas, it's really important to become familiar with them before you start treating a military family. It's important to distinguish whether or not a veteran is on active duty or has veteran status. On active duty, there are a lot of resources available for the military member and the family. But once they get out of the military and become a veteran, sometimes there's not as many services that are available to the family itself. And so that might be a concern, to make sure that we are understanding that sometimes the family kind of gets left out in the cold when working, uh, when trying to access services. The difficult piece in working with military families is sometimes they don't have access to the same services that the veteran does, so we want to be aware of that when we begin treatment. We may also have issues of amputees. These current conflicts has the highest number of amputees to any previous other conflict. And so having to deal with horrific injuries can play a role in the family. How does one adjust to the loss of a limb? How does that adjustment take place within the context of the family? Within the context of the home? The inability to do certain things that they might have done prior to deployment. These are all issues that are going to be unique to military families and take special considerations in treatment. Many young men and young women that go into the military, when they're faced with deployment, may suddenly decide that it's a good idea to get married and start a family. And the spouse is now left when that person goes onto a deployment. And they may be unsure. They may not have signed up for being a single parent. They may not know how to parent. But these are definitely issues that are unique among military members. Very impulsive types of behavior that can cause difficulties as the individual tries to adjust with their spouse now being in another country. The family you're about to meet is very typical of issues that happen within military families. We see alcohol. We see difficulty with the kids. We see new relationships that haven't had a chance to form those bonds. And so, I want you to, when you watch this video, pay attention to how I draw out some of the issues of alcohol and PTSD with Joe, who's a veteran. But also really look at some of the things that are going on with the kids and Joe's new wife, Pam. Well, welcome everybody. I'm Dr. Taylor. I want to thank you all for coming in. I got the referral from the school. And I know, Michael, that you're having some issues with, uh, some of your grades, and the school referred you all here to me. Uh, usually how I like to start things is kind of ask the group and who would like to start. Kind of, why you think you're here and what you'd like to get out of our time together today. 

00:08:55
JOE Well, he's the one who got in trouble. He should speak first. 

00:09:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR All right. Michael, what do you, you seem, uh, pretty sad right now. 

00:09:10
MICHAEL Does it really matter? I don't think he doesn't care. So. 

00:09:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR When you guys hear that, uh, hear that, what comes to mind? 

00:09:25
JOE We raised him differently. 

00:09:30
MICHAEL You, you raising me? You're hardly ever home. How did you raise me? 

00:09:35
JOE I provided by serving your country. Our country. 

00:09:40
PAM I just, uh, I just want all of us to get along. Uh, I know this is really hard on the kids, and I understand. I just, you know, I want them to know that they can come to me with anything that they need. Uh, I know the way things are right now, they're just not, I know it's not a perfect situation for the kids, so I just really would like for the entire family to start talking and getting along. 

00:10:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you want really people to get along and, and to start talking. Sarah, I can kind of see you're shaking your head. What are you feeling right now? 

00:10:25
SARAH I don't know. She's always watching TV or on the computer. I don't, she wants us to talk and get along? Maybe. 

00:10:40
JOE She controls and takes care of the house while I'm gone. You just show more respect to her. 

00:10:45
SARAH Why? She's my mom? 

00:10:50
JOE She is your mom. 

00:10:50
SARAH She's not my mom. 

00:10:50
MICHAEL She's her mom for now until you find someone else. 

00:10:55
JOE Hey. 

00:10:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR I can see from, from kind of your body language, Joe, that you seem pretty upset right now. 

00:11:05
JOE Uh, disappointed. 

00:11:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Disappointed, okay. Tell me about disappointment. 

00:11:10
JOE We don't disappoint many people in what I do. And when I come here, and I see my family, the beautiful home, you know, schools. I didn't ask for this, you know. 

00:11:30
MICHAEL You think we did? 

00:11:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR So it sounds like you, there's maybe a sense that you feel, uh, kind of let down coming back from serving your country, and things are, uh, things are very different now. 

00:11:45
JOE I understand it's difficult to go through a divorce, but at the time while I'm gone then while I'm back, the relationship was unhealthy. And, I did not want to have that portrayal for my kids as, as their perception on marriage and relationships. 

00:12:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Right. 

00:12:05
JOE And that you can go over it. You can, you know, make mistakes in life. So, I know they're going through a rough time, but the support system that they have, they should be fortunate and grateful to have what they have. 

00:12:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR So you feel that there's a, a good support system in place for the kids. 

00:12:25
JOE From what, what I've seen outside this country, they should be grateful. 

00:12:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, there's, so, so from your perspective, uh, coming from Afghanistan where things are very different, and, and now being back in the States, uh, that really maybe there's some things that are taken for granted. 

00:12:45
JOE They're spoiled. It's as simple as that. His biggest problem is what shoes to wear. Her biggest problem is what to tweet. 

00:12:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:12:55
JOE You know? That's, I don't really care for that. 

00:12:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay 

00:13:00
JOE I'm a black or white kind of guy. There's no gray. 

00:13:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Right. So, let me ask the two of you. When you hear your dad talking about kind of black and white, uh, what comes to mind? 

00:13:10
MICHAEL I don't know. I'm surprised what's going on in our lives, because they're hardly ever here. And, I mean, how can I develop a relationship with him if... I mean, she's not going to stick around. I don't even know who, who's the real mom. We, we're with our mom when he's gone, then he comes back. And it's just, I can't get used to anything, and what's the point? I feel like what's the point? Why do I even have to be here? It's like, it's stupid. 

00:13:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, it sounds like, uh, I get the sense that things are really out of control right now. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL Yeah, they are. And they, all of a sudden, once he comes back they want to be in control. But once he's gone, it's like, who cares. So, I mean, I don't want to play it perfect now just because they're all here together now. 

00:13:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Right. That, that's something that's pretty common, uh, with military families. You know, when someone goes off into a combat situation, they get deployed, everybody that's left behind kind of has to pick up the pieces and manage their lives. And it can be a lot, uh, a big challenge kind of coming back into that. And then now, what do you do, you know? Now there's this whole new dynamic in place where we're trying to figure out how to understand each other and talk to each other and live with each other all over again. So. Pam, what do you, you're kind of new to this whole thing. What's, what's, what are some of your thoughts and some of your feelings about this situation? 

00:14:50
PAM Uh, it makes me sad to know that, you know, how they feel towards me. I, I mean, I can understand where they're coming from. And I know that I'm not their mom, and I'm not trying to replace your mother by any means. I just, I'm now in your father's life, and I, I feel like I deserve respect. Uh, I, I mean, I, I want them to, to respect me and, uh, I'm going to be in their lives, so I kind of want to, you know, be able to talk to them and for them to come to me and, uh, I just want us to get along. I, I just feel like there's a lot of, I don't know, resentment or like hate towards me. I. 

00:15:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, uh, what I'm hearing from you is that you really care, that there's really a strong desire to try and, uh, get to know them and, and learn, learn what's important to them and, and be a part of their lives. That you really do, uh, care about their well being. 

00:16:00
PAM I do. 

00:16:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Have you, have you had an opportunity to, to tell them that? Without, I mean, just, uh, just to say how much you care. 

00:16:10
PAM It's a little difficult. Uh, I mean, it's, it's, its really hard just how, its, everything's very fresh right now. And, uh, I do try to reach out to them the best I can. 

00:16:25
MICHAEL How? 

00:16:25
SARAH You don't talk to us. 

00:16:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So, you guys see the situation very differently. 

00:16:35
SARAH Yeah. 

00:16:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, when I hear you say you don't talk to us, uh, I take that as that you really want to be heard. That you have something to say. That you want to be heard and acknowledged and have your opinions valued. Is that sound... 

00:16:50
MICHAEL Not really. I just want something stable. 

00:16:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR You want something stable. Okay. 

00:16:55
MICHAEL And, I mean, as far as talking, I mean, what is it? Can we really call it home? I'm hardly ever there. And when I do, she's in her room, and she's in her room. I mean, it's like I'm home alone anyway, so. 

00:17:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR So there isn't a whole lot of interaction that goes on? 

00:17:15
SARAH Well, look who's talking. You, who stays in your room and plays video games and IM'ing. 

00:17:20
MICHAEL I'm surprised. You're usually talking on the phone. How do you even know what I'm doing? You're always out with your friends. And the minute you're not, who are you crying to? Trying to get ahold of dad to ask for more money. You're one to talk. 

00:17:30
SARAH Shut up. 

00:17:35
JOE Hey. Hey. You know, she might show more through her actions than what she does, showing she cares. Cooking dinner. Taking you to school. Taking you to the mall. Shopping with you. Helping you out with your homework. 

00:17:55
MICHAEL I mean, I appreciate all that. 

00:17:55
JOE So, I mean, that's something that people don't have. And I don't, I don't respect people who don't appreciate that stuff. 

00:18:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR One of the things that I'd like to do is any time we get into situation where there's a whole, a tremendous amount of hurt and anger, I think it's always good to remind ourselves, you know, who we are and where we're at. So, let's try this. Uh, so Joe, when you think about your son, all right. And you take everything in total, right. He's 15 years old, you know, in high school now. Uh, take all of that in total. I want you to think of, of, of one word that comes to mind. What do you think of when you see your son, and you see the things that he's done. What comes to mind for you? 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:00
JOE Searching. 

00:19:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR You think that he's searching? How do you feel? That's how, when you think about everything that he's done and all of his accomplishments? 

00:19:15
JOE Well, I know with his mother, biological mother and I, that we raised him with strong morals and values in life. To learn to respect himself. And as he got older, he's lost that respect for himself. 

00:19:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR But, but the morals and the values, those are something that, that you were there and helped instill in him. To me that sounds something that, uh, that sounds like pride. 

00:19:45
JOE Of course. I take pride in everything I do. 

00:19:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR But for your son as well, right? 

00:19:50
JOE Of course. He's my first born, you know. 

00:19:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you're proud of him? 

00:19:55
JOE Not at this moment. 

00:19:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Sure. 

00:20:00
JOE But, overall, yes. 

00:20:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR We all have moments, but you're proud of your son? 

00:20:05
JOE Yes. 

00:20:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, what I want you to do, is I want you to look across, and I want you to tell him that. 

00:20:10
JOE Son, I'm proud of you. 

00:20:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Now, hearing that come from your dad, what's, what's that mean to you? 

00:20:25
MICHAEL It means a lot. 

00:20:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR It means a lot. Pam, you know, even though you're new to this situation, it really sounds like you want to help, that you want to be a part of their lives. 

00:20:45
PAM I do. 

00:20:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR What I want you to do, is can you identify for me a feeling when you, when you get an opportunity to take them to school, when you get an opportunity to do something nice for them, how does that make you feel? 

00:21:05
PAM Uh, it makes me feel part of the family. So, I mean, I would do anything to help him out. So, if it means me taking them to school or picking them up or whatever it is they need then, it makes me feel like I'm, like I belong. And... 

00:21:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, it's not something done out of obligation, but it's really something done and of a wanting to be a part of. 

00:21:40
PAM Correct. 

00:21:40
JOE I don't think they understand what she's been through, prior to me and her. And why she does what she does. 

00:21:50
SARAH What she's been through? 

00:21:50
JOE Before this. Her childhood and where she's from. And why she always cares and puts her heart out first. She didn't have what we have. Maybe it's hard for her to communicate that, but I think what she does every day through her actions speak that. 

00:22:10
SARAH What about us, Dad? What about your kids? What about you being gone all the time? What about our parents going through a divorce? What about us, Dad? 

00:22:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Sounds like you're very scared of him when he, when he leaves that sounds like a very scary thing for you. 

00:22:30
SARAH Yeah. 

00:22:30
MICHAEL I mean, what are we supposed to do if he doesn't come back? Are we supposed to depend on her? I mean, yeah, we don't know what she's been through, and I'm sorry, but how can we develop a relationship with her if we don't even know what relationship is because none of us have a relationship. I don't even. It's just hard. 

00:22:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Joe, I mean, did you realize how, uh, how scared the kids were when you get deployed? 

00:23:00
JOE Yeah, yeah. It kills me every time I leave them. 

00:23:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you say it kills you. It makes you feel, uh, what do you feel? 

00:23:15
JOE Just being trained to mask your emotions, you, you stick to the mission. You stick to the challenge in front of you, and you worry about what's in front of you only. So, I, I do what I do so they can have what they have. 

00:23:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR You want to be a provider. You want to be strong for your family, but you know, when you hear that they're, they're, they're so scared that you're not going to come back, how's that make you feel? 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:45
JOE I'm a little scared myself. 

00:23:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. What's it like hearing that your dad is scared too? Did you, did you know that? Yeah. You know, one of the biggest challenges with blended families and certainly, you know, there are a lot of them with trying to find ways to communicate and new ways to understand each other, you know. And then you have this component of your dad, you know, being in the military. 

00:24:40
MICHAEL I just, I want to see more of that. I mean, he said he's trained to mask his emotion, and it's like, so when he tells us, you know, "I love you. I care about you. I miss you." it's like how can we take him seriously when he just, he never seems like he feels any of that. I never get that from him. This is probably the first time I've ever really seen any kind of emotion on his face. 

00:25:00
SARAH Yeah. 

00:25:00
MICHAEL And, I mean, yeah sure, you're gone and we have a nice house and the things that we want, but what's the point? We don't have you. You're never there. I mean, I have nice clothes, yeah. I mean, I, I'm grateful for that, but at the end of the day if, I mean, if you're gone, if you don't come back, is this? I mean, how am I supposed to be happy? How are we supposed to be happy just because we have nice things? 

00:25:25
SARAH It means nothing at the end of the day. 

00:25:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, I'm hearing two different things, and let me know if I'm, I'm right. I hear that you really want your dad to express more, right? I mean it was very powerful for you when he said he was proud. And at the same time , you, you really are worried that something's going to happen and that you'll be alone. And that's got to be pretty scary. Does that sound about right? Yeah? You know, Joe, I mean, I know coming from the military, I, I understand how, you know, we, we're trained to bury our emotions and really focus on the mission and get the job done. What's it like for you right now, sitting here listening to your kids talk about, you know, wanting to see more emotion from you, really afraid that you're not gonna come back? This is, this is a safe place to, to talk about emotions, you know, so I'm kind of interested in, in what's going on right now for you. 

00:26:40
JOE You know, when I leave, and I leave my troops, my unit, that's what's on my mind is bringing them back to their families. Making sure they're safe and sound. And, I'm good at what I do. And I don't put myself in scenarios where I could jeopardize that or jeopardize you guys. But, people need me out there. It does come off a little bittersweet to do what I do and miss what I have, but. 

00:27:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR You feel a strong sense of duty. 

00:27:25
JOE Exactly. 

00:27:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. Yeah. 

00:27:30
JOE Not just to me, to everyone I'm home with. 

00:27:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. Let's, let's talk a little bit about, uh, you know, Pam and this kind of new relationship with you guys. Uh, you know, Pam, you know, you have talked about how much you, you want to be a part of and how much you care. You know, sometimes the biggest challenge is, is learning how to communicate our feelings and how we feel. So, I want you to tell them how you feel, how much they mean to you, but start with "I", using it from a very personal place. You know, connect it to kind of how you feel and start with kind of "I feel", and, and really kind of let them know. 

00:28:15
PAM Okay. Uh, I, I feel, I feel like, I feel like I, I care about you guys. I, I'm sorry. What am I supposed to exactly convey to them? 

00:29:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Well, what I want you to do is think about how it feels when you get to do something nice. You get to pick them up. You get to interact. When things are calm. 

00:29:20
PAM Okay. How that makes me feel? 

00:29:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Mm-hmm. 

00:29:25
PAM Okay. It's, I feel like it's, its a privilege that you guys, uh, do allow me to be involved in your lives. It's hard, uh, I feel like it's hard for me when I try to be involved in your lives, but you guys just shut me out. I. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:10
PAM I understand, but I, it makes me a little sad, you know, to... 

00:30:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you feel sad? 

00:30:25
PAM I do feel, I don't know if sad is the right word. I just, whenever it's not appreciated or just like the slamming of the door as they're leaving or, or just the silent treatment, like just on the drives to wherever we're going or. I don't know, I just, you know, they ride in the back of the car. And as we're driving, I don't know, I feel like, you know, they're talking among themselves or just snickering or something. It makes me feel uncomfortable. 

00:31:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR So you feel grateful and excited to be a part of their lives, but it sounds like you also feel dismissed or disrespected when they ignore you or aren't paying as much attention to what's going on. 

00:31:25
PAM I do feel like that. I, I feel like, I don't know, like an outsider or something. 

00:31:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:31:35
PAM Uh, I know there's just like a big wall between us. Uh. 

00:31:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR So how do we, when you talk about a wall, and I really want you all to think about that for a second. When you think about a wall, how do we, what are ways that we can, what do we do when there's a wall in front of us? We'll kind of go around the room, and I'll tie it together. So, Michael, start with you. You have, you know, you're on the football field, right, and you have a wall in front of you. What do you do? 

00:32:10
MICHAEL Go around it. 

00:32:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Go around it, okay. Sarah? Same thing. You have a wall in front of you? What do you want to do with that wall? 

00:32:20
SARAH I don't know. Find some way, some way around it. 

00:32:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay, go around it. Pam, what about you? 

00:32:30
PAM Just try to either break through it. 

00:32:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay, go through it. All right. Joe? 

00:32:35
JOE I like how everyone's answer defined their personality. 

00:32:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:32:45
JOE But, the way I was raised and the way I was trained is to group up together and climb over that wall together. 

00:32:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR This is what's interesting. We have very very different ideas on how to handle that, that barrier, right? We can go around it. We can go through it. We can go over it. And, none of those are wrong. They're all very valid ideas. What we need to do with our time together is really look at ways that we can identify the walls that you have within your relationships and find a way that works for each of you. Maybe it is going around it. Maybe a better solution might be to go over it. It could be that maybe it's a wall that we need to go through and break down. Each of those has unique characteristics that I think that we can focus on as we go together. But, I want you to really just think about that going forward when we look at the walls that we have within this relationship. And I, you know, I can understand how scary it's got to be, your dad leaving, you know. It's got to be scary for you leaving your kids. Gosh, it's got to be terrifying for you. I mean, you're new to this whole relationship, and not even really a chance to get to know anybody, and there's going to be more chaos, you know. So, we have these barriers. We have these walls. What I've heard from all of you is an ability to want to hear that your dad's proud of you. To want to know that someone's paying attention to you. To be proud of your kids. So, I think that that's a starting place. So, Pam, when you had called and, and made the appointment. You know, we had talked a lot about why you were coming in, and one of the things that you mentioned was that you were, you were concerned about, about Joe and about his drinking. Uh, you know, tell me a little bit about that. What were some of your concerns? 

00:34:50
PAM Uh, I just, he's drinking pretty much every day. Uh, and I feel like he, anything, any time we have a fight or something that's, he always goes straight, straight for something, you know, that has alcohol. I mean, he has to have something before he goes to sleep. And it worries me. 

00:35:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:35:25
JOE That's not true. 

00:35:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you're very worried? Very worried? 

00:35:30
PAM I, I feel like it's too much. 

00:35:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So, Joe, what are you hearing from, from Pam? 

00:35:35
JOE This is all new to me. 

00:35:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:35:40
JOE We never had a, any serious problem with this. I don't, I've never laid a hand on her with anything. I don't drink too much. 

00:35:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:35:50
JOE I don't drink every night. I don't need a drink before I go to sleep. I wish you'd told me this back at the house and not in front of. 

00:35:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you don't see it as, as a problem? 

00:36:00
JOE No. I, I have my occasional drink here and there, you know, after what I do, a hard day's work. And meeting up with the buddies, you know. Kick back. But, as in what she's referring to? No. 

00:36:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:36:10
PAM I've mentioned it to him. 

00:36:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:36:15
PAM I mean, I don't think I've sat down and completely like said, "Hey", but I've mentioned it to you. I, I smell your breath. I, I feel like, I mean, when he goes out with his buddies, he comes home and he's, I mean, I can see . I can tell he's been drinking, you know. And I just feel like that's your go to, you know, when anything happens. I, I don't know. I feel like it's, it is an issue. 

00:36:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, you're really, it's an issue, and it's concerning for you. 

00:36:45
PAM Very much. 

00:36:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Sarah, what do you, do you think about all this? 

00:36:50
SARAH Yeah, it's a big problem. He's here. He's at home. He's safe, but he's not here. He's not dad when he picks up a drink. He doesn't, he can't be there for us when he's drinking. He's not dad. 

00:37:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Michael? 

00:37:10
MICHAEL Well, there's not a lot of things that I agree with Pam, but she is right. And of course, he's going to deny that it's a problem. I mean, his training as far as everything for his explanations, it's like he's not going to admit that he's, you know, drinking every day, but he does. And, she's right. He's not the same. I mean, he comes back, and we're so excited for him to be back. And then he's out with his buddies. It's like, didn't you spend enough time with them over there? And... 

00:37:40
JOE I see, I see them maybe once a week. 

00:37:45
MICHAEL Yeah, the same for us too. You see us maybe once a week. And then when you do, I mean, you're what, under the influence? I can't even have a decent conversation with you. And you don't think it's a problem. Unbelievable. 

00:38:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR It almost sounds, um, I hear anger. 

00:38:00
MICHAEL It is. I'm told I have a problem. I was, I was brought here for my school because I have a problem. I mean, I think the problem is from them. 

00:38:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So, we have a lot of concern, I think, about, about drinking. Joe, uh, from your perspective, uh, what's too much? 

00:38:30
JOE I've never gotten in trouble. 

00:38:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:38:35
JOE I don't drink and drive. 

00:38:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:38:40
JOE I need to walk somewhere, I walk home. If I need to sleep somewhere I sleep there with them, with my buddies. I've never came off aggressive. I've never touched any of them. So, I've never, I don't understand this as a problem. I have, yes, I have a couple of drinks, not just one. But, you know, there's so much going on, uh, and I'm part of it. Going on so quickly, that sometimes I do need to relax my mind a little bit. And it's not something I encourage or I want them to be witnesses of, but I mean. 

00:39:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR So from, tell me from your perspective, what's a couple drinks? It's a typical night. You go out with your buddies. Define for me "a couple", because that has different meanings. 

00:39:30
JOE You know, two or three whiskeys. 

00:39:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Two or three whiskeys? Okay. So that's just it, two or three whiskeys? 

00:39:40
JOE Yeah. 

00:39:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. And it sounds like that from your perspective, as long as you can walk home or your not getting arrested, you know, you're, you're not, you know, being violent, then there's no longer a problem. 

00:39:55
JOE I consider what they're saying, and I understand where, where they're coming from. I don't agree with all of it, cuz they know I'm always there for them, drink or no drink. And if I do have a drink in the house, it's after dinner, after everyone's asleep, done with their homework, which we need to talk about that some other time, but it's, it's my little time for myself. And, I don't see a problem with that. 

00:40:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR It sounds something that it's needed for you, that it helps you. 

00:40:30
JOE Yes. I just, I, I've seen some things that I would never wished that anyone would see, and it, yeah. 

00:40:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, it helps. It helps maybe with some of the, the things that you've experienced. 

00:40:55
JOE Yeah. 

00:41:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR You know, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is pretty common with a lot of people coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And one of the key features of that is kind of disturbing images when you sleep or when you're getting ready to sleep. 

00:41:15
JOE It's hard to sleep. 

00:41:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah, I bet. 

00:41:20
JOE Peacefully. They, they, they are my life. They're my joy and my heart. But, they don't know what I've been through, and I don't want them to know. 

00:41:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR You want to protect them. 

00:41:35
JOE Exactly. 

00:41:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR You know, it's interesting. I want you to think about that for a second. You know, you talked about wanting your dad to open up more, right? But there's this hesitation to open up because you want to protect them. Isn't that kind of neat in a sense? He talks about wanting to protect you? Did you know that? 

00:41:55
MICHAEL No. 

00:42:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, Joe, uh, sounds like you have trouble sleeping most nights? 

00:42:10
JOE Couple a week, few a week maybe. 

00:42:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Few a week? Tell me what's a few, because my definition of a few might be different than yours. Is that three, four, five? 

00:42:20
JOE Three. 

00:42:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Three? 

00:42:25
JOE Yeah. Two or three. 

00:42:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Two or three. Is it something that you find difficulty staying asleep or falling asleep? Waking up? 

00:42:30
JOE A little bit of everything. 

00:42:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. And the alcohol helps. It helps kind of relax you, helps you sleep? 

00:42:45
JOE Yeah, I mean, if, if I look back at those times it's usually when it's a mixture of those memories and present stress and problems. Uh, it could be overwhelming sometimes. 

00:43:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Sure. 

00:43:05
JOE And, I like to keep that to myself. 

00:43:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. It's not something that you want to share with the rest of the family because you want to protect them. 

00:43:15
JOE Yes. 

00:43:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR That's very common with soldiers. We want to protect. We want to shield everybody from our troubles, which makes it difficult sometimes to open up and allow other people to share our burdens. Uh, you know, just quickly, you know, I want to ask each of you, uh, and it's kind of a yes or no question, but I kind of know the answer. Uh, knowing that your dad has burdens, let's say, would you want to help your dad with those? Sarah? 

00:44:00
SARAH Yeah. 

00:44:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Pam? 

00:44:05
PAM Absolutely. 

00:44:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR What's it like for you, Joe, hearing that your whole family is willing to help and share in part of those burdens? 

00:44:15
JOE I, I don't, I don't ask for help, but it feels good. 

00:44:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR I can see it kind of makes you uncomfortable. 

00:44:30
JOE A little bit. 

00:44:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. 

00:44:35
JOE Yeah. 

00:44:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR It's a, it's a different experience, coming from being in the military and knowing that, you know, there's so much riding on your shoulders and that you have to protect yourself. You have to protect your squad. At the same time you want to protect your family from all of that ugliness that you see. I think sometimes we forget that, that they're there to, they want to help us too. You know, uh, one of the things with PTSD is, you know, a lot of, kind of part of that culture within the military is to do a lot of drinking. And so, I don't dispute that, you know, you have two, three whiskeys, uh, but coming from the military I'm wondering if maybe that there's, maybe you're minimizing that a little much. When you think about it, going out with your friends, you know, a lot of stuff going on at home, thinking about going back into Afghanistan. 

00:45:45
[sil.] 

00:45:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR And Pam, when you think about a typical night, how much do you see him drink? 

00:45:55
PAM I've seen some nights he goes through like half a bottle. 

00:46:05
JOE No, that's not. 

00:46:05
PAM You have. Uh, I mean, I don't think he notices, but I, I mean, I see it. I clean it up. I see, you know, how much we have left. Uh, I mean, I, I understand what he's talking about, what he's saying. I mean, he wakes up, you know, with nightmares. And, uh, I mean, I can't imagine what he went through, but it's a little scary. He does become like a different person when he's under the influence. And it's a little scary. Uh, I mean, I, it's true, he's never touched us or anything, but he does have like, uh, I don't know, like his mood changes. He becomes a little bit more impatient or something. Uh, yeah, I mean, he does drink, you know, after dinner. He doesn't try to do it so much in front of the kids, or tries to hide it a little. Uh, but I, I see it. I see it, and even when he comes home from work or, you know, I can smell it on his breath. I know that he's been drinking because he does change a little bit when he's, when he's been drinking. 

00:47:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. I think that that's certainly, uh, going forward that's something that we can talk about, you know, when we look at. And we talked about those walls, you know. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, it might be something we want to look at, you know. There's some very good treatments for it. Using too much alcohol, you know, it's a wall. The communication between the four of you becomes a wall. The nice thing about walls is they're usually something we can go around. We can go through or we can go over. So, I think going forward it's going to be important for all of you to kind of focus on what can we do together to try and understand each other's walls and find ways to help each other navigate them. Okay? You guys have any questions for me? Okay. This is what I'd like you guys to try, all right. Over the next week, between now and when we see each other again, I want you to really practice telling each other very positive things about how you feel, all right? I'm proud of you. You know, I'm excited that I get to do something for you, you know. I'm so glad your home. I missed you. And really start with that, the "I" in a very personal piece, and kind of connect it to how you're feeling. And, and, and just practice that for the next week, all right. Not every day, okay, but just kind of try it out. It's going to feel a little uncomfortable to start with, okay. But, again, we're, we're here because everybody cares, and, and that's a good place to start, right? I know that this is difficult. It's never easy. It isn't. It's not easy to talk about how we feel. It's not easy to think about your dad going off to war. It's not easy about having a new person in your life, whether it's a brother or sister or a new mom. You know, it's not easy, but it takes a tremendous amount of strength and courage to come in and sit here and talk about these things. And I really want to honor that for, for all of you. You're, it takes a tremendous amount of strength to do that. So, don't forget that. All right. This is something that it can get better, okay? Thanks for coming in. 

00:50:20
PAM Thanks for having us.
