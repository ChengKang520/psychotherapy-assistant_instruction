Case History/Soul History 

00:00:55
James Hillman, PhD 

00:00:55
JAMES HILLMAN Alright. Today our topic is Soul History/Case History or Case History/Soul History. The very fact that we're calling that as a title suggests that there may be a difference, a difference and it's that difference that I want to point out because usually we don't have that question, usually there is a case history, I don't know how often you run into the term soul history. Does your soul have a history? Well, do you even use the term soul in psychotherapy. Most of us have dropped that term back when the churches were active, but or we find it in a graveyard somewhere, but in fact for me it is the crucial term of the entire work because the word psyche in Greek from which our field comes from psychotherapy, psychology, psycho analysis and psychodynamics and all the rest actually means soul work, mean soul, so we have to bend our minds around the absence of it in our usual conversation and attempt to bring it back into this room during this hour. Now of course it's not lost really in the street, we have soul brother, we have soul sister, we have soul music, we have soul food, so we do know that it's still alive whether that is crept into psychotherapy from the street, I don't know. I hope to do something for it during this hour. Now, I guess we do know what we're looking for with a case history and what the case history usually signifies, what kinds of questions we ask for, for case history such as we look for a diagno with the words that get associated with case history or words like diagnosis, present complaint and a lots of numbers especially medical numbers, the numbers you get on your blood report from the lab, all those numbers would tell your case history, tell your case condition at the moment or the kinds of numbers the insurance companies want, the numbers that correlate with the DSM or the numbers that go with the legal system and the social agency system and so all of that belongs to a person’s case history following me I hope on this, this is pretty barren clear stuff, it doesn't resonate, it doesn't echo, but it's the basic material that we consider a case history also the family, family belongs to case history where are you, what sibling are you, the third or the first or the oldest or the youngest because with that idea comes a whole lot of statistical stuff about the effects of the oldest one or the youngest one in the family and so on. And then we want to know about mothers, we want to know about fathers if they were either, there is usually a mother, it's hard to be born without one, but fathers tend to sometimes no longer play a role in the case history. The absent father then plays a role. What else goes with case history, work employment, jobs, the CV of what you've done, your education level and how you did in education or none or minimal amounts of it. In other words we're getting a kind of description of a person sociologically, maybe economically someone who can fit into a statistical pattern or into a geographical pattern, locations, although that's a question whether geography belongs to the soul or belongs to the case. The case also includes usually a description of complaint, present complaint, why is the person come to see you or been assigned to see you by the courts? What is the description of the complaint which may not be fit exactly with a diagnostic term, but it does belong to the case history. Now what's left out because this is the question, what's left out or before I get to what's left out, what else do you think might belong to that. I'm gonna open the place, I know there are lot of people here that chime in, so it may be risky to do this. Let's see what else would there will be mics I suppose and out for discussion. So let's, I'll ask you to think about what else might be included in the case history that I could have left out. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Developmental stressors. 

00:06:40
JAMES HILLMAN Developmental stressors, is that the word I heard? Fascinating, sounds like a bridge. Developmental stressors, you mean being beaten up as a child, things like that. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Illness, frequent flus. 

00:07:00
JAMES HILLMAN That's good, illness, frequent, yeah abuses, isolations, punishments, neighborhoods, we didn't do much with the neighborhoods where one is as I said sociologically. Thank you. Good person in the front row there, that's very good. Developmental stressors, it's interesting that's put in the language of development. There are stressors that belong to the case history. You are already imagining, you see with that sentence we're already imagining a development, we're already imagining a person starting in infancy or even earlier and going through stages of development and then there are stressors during each of those stages and in certain theories some of those stressors are more serious and some are overcome more easily and so on. But the idea of trauma is important, but that's also important in soul history. So we may shift now for a minute over to soul history. The very first thing that began our field, which has evolved or developed or devolved into psychotherapy was started by Freud and Jung a 100 years ago, around 1900 roughly, some of it begins a little earlier, but basically it begins and it begins with a book by Sigmund Freud, The Interpretation of the Dreams, Interpretation of Dreams, a very thick book and filled with his dreams, lots of his dreams, which he analyzed. I would like to know although I don't see very well because of these airport lights what, how many people have at least held that book in their hand, I'm not asking you to whether you have read it, that's splendid, that's great. Congratulations. That's great. Now that would be number one for soul history. What did you dream last night? When the person comes in, the person whom we now call patient, client, there are probably some other words for it, psycho, I mean we're talking among ourselves. So that asking for a dream right at the beginning consulates something else, invites something else to take part in the therapeutic conversation, opens the door to the unexpected. Did you dream last night, have you had any dreams recently, do you ever think about your dreams, do you remember any dreams from childhood, do you remember your earliest dream. The answer to that is usually I have, there is no usual answer actually, some people dream and remember their dreams and are interested in their dreams all their lives without necessarily writing them down or telling other people, but they have an openness to their dreams, other people very rarely dream and very rarely, even more rarely record them in anyway. But that moment of asking for the dream invite something else in besides the case history, something that was not brought into the sociological developmental number game of the case history, no place for it in the form that you may have to fill out for whatever paying authority there is or your supervisor. Another thing that really belongs in enquiring or evoking the idea of something else that there might be a soul involved in all of this or things like longingness, do you ask ever about longingness. Now the Germans in the romantic period of literature and philosophy said, tell me what you long for and I will tell you who you are. That's not our notion of how we get our identity. But this is the soul history now, the longing that may have been there in early childhood, the longing that may be never spoken or spoken very rarely or one is very embarrassed about it and the longing, the embarrassment that goes with the longing is already an indication of soul cos' soul doesn't necessarily come forth as in an extroverted way, it may appear through these feelings of awkwardness, deficiency, embarrassment, solitude, not fitting quite in and if one can touch the longings or the nostalgia or the regrets or the desires and desires come in form of images often, certain image, a certain place a person, a woman, a man, a figure, a figure that's appeared in a dream that evokes desire. These are very hard things to fit into a case history and write it up and yet I think we feel what we're talking about and it's the loss of these things that the old writing talks about as loss of soul. Secrets are very important. Now it's very difficult to ask someone you have never met before in your life who has been assigned to your little green office in the windowless building that the state has given you to bring back soul to your clients to ask for secrets and yet the work, the work is a secret work from the beginning. When Freud saw his first people, it was secret, they had a strange system of the doors his apartment house in Vienna where he lived was up one storey and they went up the stairs and then there was different doors so that his office was to the side somewhere else. There was actually a butcher shop down below so that every patient who went to see him walk past the meat hanging up in the window, which was a very healthy thing if you think about it. The morbidity that goes with the soul, very important. It's not merely growth which we'd like to believe in America, we are a great country, the result of growth. We're living that problem right now and -- but there was the dead meat hanging. Anyway, this sense that there is something secret in me, about me, I've never told this to anyone before, I've never known this before, this is not the unconscious, this is where the unconscious kills it because it's just a big blank word like so many others of our psychological words. But secrecy and the secret touches very deeply, and the sharing of secrets. And it is a great -- it is quite wrong to assume that you can get a person's secrets or share secrets with them without some kind of rapport. But if you as a therapist imagine there are secrets here, you're not a detective, you're not an investigator, but if you can imagine there are secrets here, treasured secrets, feared secrets, embarrassed secrets, you are at least beginning to respect the soul the other person, that there is soul here as well. Another part of the soul history that only comes in as a geographic description, meaning I used to live in Mendocino and now I live in Richmond, California, then we moved to the southern part of the state, so I'm living outside of San Diego. That's one way of describing it. And you can put it in the case history about how often the person moved and which schools he went to on the way and so on, but there are also landscapes. Now we all know that certain landscapes appeal to us in specific ways and we feel this is really where my soul is happiest or I can't bear living in the high desert. I just shutter thinking about the high, living in the high desert, where for someone else that's soul country. Now allowing a person to describe the landscape that you can even leave all the other stuff out and just begin to do landscape talk, where they like to be. Now there are lots of people that never have been in any landscape, they live in streetscape, and streetscape also is soul country, neighborhoods are soul country. But you can expand the notion of soul by inquiring and inviting in neighborhood talk, hood talk, street talk, landscape talk. But some landscapes are even imaginary, they may never have been to this place or that place, by the sea or in high mountains or whatever or very heavily wooded, pastureland and so on and so forth. But the landscape suggests that there are qualities of soul that landscape bespeaks. So you're not a culture, we don't really feel that innate connection between person and nature. But I'm thinking in Chinese painting, but I'm thinking in particularly in Japanese presentation of self, the landscape, the season of the year is crucial. If you send someone a card with cherry, with prune blossoms or plum blossoms, it says something about what season of the year and what's happening at that moment. I don't have to write and say I'm feeling better, I've been sick all winter, but now I'm feeling a little better, things are opening up. The plum blossoms say that. And it's very important that these images of the landscape, if you can talk about landscape, if you can talk about the seasons and we get to that curiously still in our culture through astrology. People say they're Sagittarian or they're a Aquarian and they know the season of the year that goes with that and that they have a feeling for winter. Well, I mean here in Southern California we got a day of rain, so maybe that's winter, I don't know. But I think you can imagine this world that I'm talking about as a way of inviting soul into the conversation and it may have very little to do with actual experience. Remember I said at the beginning, tell me what you long for and I'll tell you who you are, or at least I'll tell you something about your soul. And the longing for certain landscapes tells something to the therapist. And there can be a conversation about landscapes without ever getting into anything personal and yet a great deal of emotional truth comes forward. See I realize there's so little time in the therapeutic system that we've established, so how quickly can we do this kind of thing of evoking soul. There's very little time for it. And if you spend your time taking down the case history and getting all the details of the person's educational life, family life, and what the parents did, you won't get this other stuff. What would happen if you paid no attention at all to the case history, none, and just began to talk as if you were two strangers meeting on an island somewhere and telling each other your fantasies, your dreams, your longings, your secrets. You'd be in soul territory, you'd be in a connection that's very different than one person recording the numbers and the case history facts as they're thought to be facts of a person’s life.

00:22:10
JAMES HILLMAN  I've missed something that probably belongs among the top things and that is the joys and sorrows of a life, the joys and the sorrows. The Swiss French philosopher Rousseau said that, that's what life is being able to handle or manage or live to full extent the joys and the sorrows of life. If you can invite beyond the present complaint the sorrow of the present complaint, it's a different feeling, it's a different feeling. Now some people are quite open with that. They're able to reap almost immediately, but the reaping is not necessarily the expression of the sorrow. Sorrow, the word itself has such a resonance, it's beyond sadness, it's not depression, it's the sorrows, it's got regret in it, it's got beauty in it, it's got loss in it, it's got longing in it. And so the soul is touched by remembering or speaking of sorrows, and it's not the same as being sorry. I mean, even President Reagan was sorry. Its sorrow in a very deep sense, the way a dog could look at you with sorrow in its face, even though it's not conscious of being sorrowful. And the joys are the same sort of thing, joys may be very simple things, but they express such a fountain of life quality, a certain joy that's irreplaceable that I remember so well that I've only touched once or twice in my whole life and so on. I hope you're with me on that -- those kinds of emotions that are so unusual in a way and yet are the very basis of the highs and lows of our -- of the soul. Now I think also belonging to the soul history are prayers what -- when people pray if they pray, what they pray for, and the condition therein when they pray. That also somehow brings you in contact with what I am talking about. I haven't mentioned yet, which is probably the first thing that comes to some people's mind is their beloved, a beloved, the high school boyfriend, the early childhood first love, someone's favorite person in life, someone's partner at the moment, but some or some animal, don't leave out the animals for what's being carried by how animals carry soul value. There are many, many stories and many books have been written about young boys of about 14 or so who have the opportunity when in their youth to have had a horse or lived with a horse and how they can communicate with their horse far better than with any member of the family and they can go out in the stable and talk to their horse and feel more with the horse than they can. They find soul with the horse, as many kids find soul with their animals and as many other people find them at all through life with their animals. So there is a soul animal also. Now in other societies the soul animal is a well known figure and is a figure in fairytales, it's a figure in religious ceremonies, in household cults and so on there is an animal that carries soul for you, and that also belongs for recovering the sense of soul in therapy. If the thing is stuck and you can't talk and he won't talk and you feel that blockage, you can talk about animals. What animals did they have, what beloved animal and how it was cared for and what it felt like when the animal was put down or when the animal was -- ran away or run over. This is soul talk. 

00:27:30

00:27:35
JAMES HILLMAN There are also escape fantasies. Now I don't know whether they ever find their way into a case history. In other words, would you really like to cut loose and get out, disappear, go off. What kinds of escape fantasies are there going on and in the escape fantasies sometimes the whole, what you might call redemptive process is epitomized, if I could just get a motorcycle and get south of this border I would be another person or what is that other person, what is that freedom. If I could just whatever it is get out of this box and what the box is, is the sociological case history. I want to get out of my life because I'm boxed into all these numbers, diagnoses, complaints, conversations with the judge, conversations with the parole officer or conversations with the people and so on, the school, therapist, the this, the that, this whole enormous web of psychotherapy. What's, is there an escape fantasy from psychotherapy itself, from you the therapist and it doesn't mean that they hate you or dislike you or anything, it's that you represent the case history and not the soul history and the soul is trying to get free to find some other avenue, so it isn't stifled, so that it can imagine because that's the crucial thing, I'm asking for imagination all the time, the imagination in a dream, the imagination in a prayer, the imagination of the beloved, the imaginary conversation with a horse or the dog, the imaginary sitting by the river bank and fishing. In other words, I'm asking to escape from reason and fact into imagination. 

00:30:15

00:30:20
JAMES HILLMAN Now, someone mentioned, aah, developmental stressors, right? And we could also speak of them as wounds, and I like the word wound better than trauma. I -- I have a sense of woundedness and of being wounded and of recurrent wounds without any specific traumatic event that caused the wound, we bear wounds and the -- if one can talk about the woundedness and the sense of unabledness that comes with it or the feeling of this vulnerability to hurt how easily one is hurt in different -- and how one hurts oneself again and again because of the woundedness, then I think this is a way of talking about, aah, about soul rather than the traumatic events that happened. Now, when I say all that, I'm really not trying to put down the case history altogether, I'm -- I'm trying to steer us away from it because I know that's what we're taught to pay attention to and to fit the person somehow make sense of the person's complaint in terms of the -- this background called the case history. But I -- I do think that -- that being trapped in case history is one of the things the escape, that -- that all the words I've been using can help free you and the client from, can help you and the client become freer from the entrapment in the case history. So, in the short time you have with a person, whom you've never seen before, but maybe you get a file with a whole lot of stuff in that file. Aah, rather than reading the file, rather than hearing the story, begin naked, begin looking for soul. You can always come back [00:33:00 ]to the case, the person will anyway come back to the case. Clients today have been trained for 100 years of psychotherapy. Since 1900, they know how to do psycho babble, they know how to tell about their past, they know how to tell about their parents, what they did to them, they know how to what it is that their father left when they were three, they know that their father was an alcoholic, they know that their older brother beat them up, they know -- they know the whole game of how it works or the language, sorry, they know the language. And I'm suggesting that you can leave that aside because they'll bring that in any way all the time. In fact, it's part of their disorder. The presenting complaint that the person brings within the language in which they bring it is part of their disorder because they are in a disordered condition or they wouldn't have to see you, they wouldn't be coming to you voluntarily or involuntarily and part of that disorder is the way they formulate their disorder. Now they call that reframing and so and so forth and cognitive so on, I'm leaving that up. I just want to suggest to you that that's not the most important thing to listen to. It will come up and it will be very important to find ways to step aside from it, so that you can hear for something else. Now why do we do that, why bother with soul? Well, that's a toughie, I have to admit, why bother with soul? Well, I don't know why else I do the work, frankly, because I'm not really interested in the other part. I'm -- I have to admit that. I'm really interested in the imagination of the person, in the -- in the -- in the riches of the person's psyche, in the peculiar life the person has, the phenomenology of -- of human being and I'm not interested really in sociology. I read about that every day in the paper and I know the tragedies of it. I know what the -- bing boxed is in -- in impossible sociological, economic circumstances. So I want to find that freedom that can escape from that and find the depths of soul that's, I think, potentially in each person and that a person has experienced it moments all through his or her life in certain ways, but it's so easily dismissed. And that's another part of the memory that may be of interest when you're talking are those moments when they felt they were missed, when the teacher didn't get what they were at and they remember that, that time or when the previous therapist missed the moment when they were just about whatever it was and it was missed or they tried to connect with their own mother and she froze up, just froze up and they remember that, those moments when it was missed and those are indications again of soul sensitivity that I think we as therapists want to, aah, recover. Now to do all that means, it has a lot to do with our language and it's pretty tough, this business of the language of psychotherapy, it's got really become a dead language, it is so filled with concepts, so filled with -- it's got so little imagination left in it, so little color, vitality, it -- it uses the terms that you are taught in training and whether you can speak crazily enough, oddly enough with metaphors, with parallels that almost don't make sense in just some jarring way to disturb the language a little bit that's usual so that there's this -- a moment of incomprehension, startle, surprise, something that just shakes the box a bit so that your response is not the expected response in the expected language or picking up on a word that the person says. For example I picked up on your word stressor and that wasn't meant to insult you, it was to make us conscious that, that word comes out of actual engineering, the word stress comes out of what steel beams go through and bridge, building and so on, it's a technical term that became picked up in our general language. And now, we -- when we use a term like stress, we are actually putting ourselves back into some inanimate, aah, metallic thing. So when we listen to what the person is saying, we want to pick certain words, "Oh! That's -- that's a curious thing the person said" or we wanna hear and use our own words as best we can so that they do something, you only have that hour that short 50 minutes or 30 minutes whatever you have. So anything you can do to startle, to change, to shock, to -- it's like using psychic shock treatments, little ones, which come with the language. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN So, you're asking for a volunteer. 

00:39:50
JAMES HILLMAN Aah, not specially. I don't -- don't think that would -- it tends to narrow things. I can do more by imagining this way than I can by so-called factual demonstration because it tends to narrow, the -- we narrow the -- the idea to the example and I would rather explore in your own imaginations, each of you having your own demonstrations coming out of the, rather than you follow me there that you can each imagine these things in your own life and in your own practice, whereas a demonstration for me tends to -- you -- they -- this becomes an example and you're gonna learn something from it, that's not it. And I know you are here to learn, but there are other kinds of learning, there is learning of your own self in your own echoing or not echoing, I mean this may be a waste of time for some of you and in that's the case, there are many other things going on in this building and I take no offence of people leaving, I'll assume you're going to the bathroom. So, so what I'm suggesting is that the demonstration, you are the demonstration and I am the demonstration in -- in my attempt to formulate as I go along. The idea in all this is to -- is to get to something deeper, something broader, something higher because those are the dimensions I imagine with soul and out of the box, the box of the person's formulated story, out of the box of the sociological situation that the person has placed herself in, the trap, the victimization. And the -- the interesting thing here is that some of the greatest people in the world like Mandela, and Gandhi, and so on, all those -- Cleaver were in jail or in the trap, I mean the literal trap absolutely tight box with no possibility of movement and yet they developed extraordinary soul qualities. So that's a model for what I'm saying that the soul doesn't have to live in the box and that the box may be a place where the soul actually finds escape or escape is the soul. 

00:43:00

00:43:05
JAMES HILLMAN I'm going to read a little piece from my book called "Suicide and the Soul", just to say one little thing. 

00:43:20
[sil.] 

00:43:25
JAMES HILLMAN Soul history is recaptured by separating it from case history. The immediate family for instance become the real people they are undistorted by inner meanings, which they had been forced to carry. You see the -- the family tends to carry a whole lot of meanings like your mother tends to carry the meaning of being a bad mother or a cold mother or an absent mother or a drunken mother or a cigarette smoking, late getting up in the morning mother whatever, and they carry a certain fixed character and you never see your mother or what was going on with her soul until maybe late in life after she is dead, you have all series of new reflections about this woman who happen to be your mother and that's one of the things that soul history can do. I'm getting a signal, am I supposed to do something? I have 10 minutes to do something or whatever finished, yes okay, thank you. Nothing to do with the tape or something. No, okay. Ahm, the rediscovery of soul history shows itself in the reawakening of the emotion, fantasy, dream, the things I pointed out in a sense of a -- of a kind of mythological destiny, there's something here I was meant to be. I was meant to be on this planet, I don't know what it is, I don't know what the meaning is, but somehow I may not ever know what the meaning is of life or my life, but I feel there's something meant in what I'm doing. And also time has somehow freed a bit with these peculiar things that have broken into my life at odd moments and as this separation occurs from case history and become less of a case and more of a person. Soul history emerges as one sheds case history, in other words, another way of saying it is soul history is a living obituary, you hear, you find your life having some kind of pattern in it of longings, of figures, of loves, of desires. 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
JAMES HILLMAN Now there is a responsibility, aah, no there's -- yeah, there's a responsibility of the therapist here not merely to enquire and imagine of all this is going on in the patient, but that your own -- your own soul is somehow involved with this other person because that's a difficult part. You're trained to have empathy and you're supposed to have empathy. Now empathy is just another word for love, you know, it's a technical word for love and you cannot be told to love someone. I mean that's one of the great mistakes of, you know, Western religion. You know, love -- you can't force love and you can't force empathy. Some people are naturally more empathic, but it's only if you feel there's a soul, a suffering soul there, it's only if you feel tragic, a sense of tragedy here in this life that we are engaged in a really tragic situation that it comes out, it's hard to feel the empathy automatically as it's supposed to be felt and that's why there is so much burn out in this in social work or so much subtle, insidious, profiteering from the suffering of others. One of the shadows of our work is living off the suffering of others because you are a healer and a helper, beware. So it's through the sense of the depth of tragic situations and circumstances that people fall into that empathy appears. That's a whole background of the great works of art in our culture, the Greek tragedies, those were horrible situations or Shakespeare's tragedies, horrible situations. But the heart is so moved by those situations that empathy and Aristotle, the great philosopher said the -- the soul is purged or cleansed through that, through the -- the -- the -- through tragedy. So I'm saying we don't just have cases who are in a mess behind those cases that are in a mess are tragic situations and it's the sense of tragedy that opens the heart the most, and the widest and the deepest, and that's the calling, that's the calling of the work and that you can respond to without a commandment to love. Now, I have or you all have to get out of here in five minutes, I'm giving the message and I haven't let anyone say anything because I don't think their mic set up and I don't think we have that kind of situation, but I'd be glad to take a question if somebody can get close enough to so that everyone can hear it. Yes, I can't see a thing, yes you got a mic? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Hello not work... 

00:50:10
JAMES HILLMAN No mic. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN This one is locking. 

00:50:15
JAMES HILLMAN Come on up. All right go ahead, yes. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN You know, I have been fighting sleep. 

00:50:25
JAMES HILLMAN You've been fighting sleep? 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I've been - - every time I sit with someone, I asked him if I start nodding please poke me. And this young lady over here was kind enough to do that on one occasion. 

00:50:40
JAMES HILLMAN And your point?

UNKNOWN And my point is that all of a sudden I woke up. 

00:50:45
JAMES HILLMAN All of a sudden you woke up. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Listening to you talk, the first time, hey. 

00:50:50
JAMES HILLMAN Well, hey, how about that confirmation. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN And then all of a sudden I said, yeah on a clear day rise and look around you. 

00:51:05
JAMES HILLMAN He wanted the mic, that's all thank you. Good. Next question. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Okay. My question is... 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN No. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

00:51:10
JAMES HILLMAN He just wanted the mic, that's all. That's very good. Thank you. Yes. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN My question, there's a mic over here too and my question is this children oftentimes... 

00:51:25
JAMES HILLMAN I can't see where you are. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN Children often times. 

00:51:25
JAMES HILLMAN Okay, got you. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Escape into the world, and the world of virtual reality. So how would you help children who are basically in the world of imagination and want to stay there for ever to come into the world of reality of the soul. Do you have any ideas? 

00:51:45
JAMES HILLMAN That's -- that's the question of our day, isn't it? The -- the texting and all the rest of it, right? 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:50
JAMES HILLMAN Yeah. Well, you know, children also need something that they used to use in other ages, which is called discipline. 

00:52:05
[sil.] 

00:52:10
JAMES HILLMAN So there are certain rules, when you can do that, and how much you can do that. If it in -- in other ages, we call certain things vices, and we didn't let children do them. That sounds horrible, doesn't it? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:35
JAMES HILLMAN I think I'm -- I think we're over. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Alright.
