R. WAYNE GILPIN Now we're awake. My name is Wayne Gilpin, President of Future Horizons, your host for the conference today. A couple housekeeping things real… real fast. Umm… Later at the morning break we'll have out there for you certificates that we will sign for you at the afternoon break or the end of the day. If you go to that desk where you're registered, you can pick it up there and again we'll fill it in and we'll sign it for you at the end of the day or at the afternoon break, not before. You can use that certificate, take back to your school or your clinic or approve to your husband you're really here. Whatever you want to use it for? Next if you're a member of (inaudible) or APA or AOTA, you should have signed in when you arrived. If you did not, while in the first break you can go out and you can… you can sign in then. You're sitting there wondering what is (inaudible) and AOTA. I would say you don't have to worry about it. Next is that we will be… I and my (inaudible) staff will be available all day long and then we do to make your… your stay better. We will… we will certainly… certainly do. Next is that as the President of Future Horizons. I am proud and somewhat mystified that we put on about 24 conferences a year. Showing that we're not all that bright. I have looked forward to this conference more than any other the entire year. The idea of being here on Temple Grandin's birthday with Temple Grandin's mother being here at the same time, was just so exciting I couldn't wait to do it. And then the idea of having the Temple Grandin and Eustacia Cutler answering questions at the afternoon break was just even more exciting. You'll be a part of that. Any questions that you want to have asked of Temple, please write them out in fairly neat handwriting. I won't speaks Spanish, so he's being English and if you get that to me leave… leave them at the… at the bookstore and I'll put them… them with the… with the list and we'll ask the questions of Temple and her and her charming mother at the one o'clock start. So write it out, write your question out, leave it at the bookstore and they'll make sure to get it to me. I'm the oldest of nine kids. I'm the father of three and I've always had this theory that the birthday gift should be given to the mother, not to the kid. The kid did nothing except show up. The mother went through nine months of labor, went through the… the birth trauma and we give gifts to the… to the kid, doesn't make sense to me. Following up on that, I will tell you that I take great pride and all the speakers of Future Horizons brings to the conferences, all of them. I insist that they know what they're talking about. I insist it be able to communicate and assisted they care about our kids. All our speakers today meet that in spades. Jim Ball, who speaks last today, he has more energy than any speaker you've ever seen in your… in your… in your life. Temple, you already know about. Temple's mother (inaudible) if you haven't heard… heard her speak before. And I'll tell you that again speaking about the honor of introducing these speakers today. Temple Grandin is an icon within the autism world. How many of you have heard (inaudible) speak before? Wow! How many of you have never heard Temple Grandin speak? I can't believe that. You know, you are at an autism conference, right? Temple Grandin is a gift to the Autism World. Her expertise, and her books and her knowledge are known throughout the world. That gift to the world would not have arrived without the lady we're going to have speak today. First, Eustacia Cutler is someone that I admire in many… many ways. She's a Harvard graduate. She's a… she's graduate in… in English literature. She's very well verse. She's a beautiful speaker. As you'll hear, she use the English language like a (inaudible) uses a violin. And I'll tell you that way back when 67 years ago, there was no track to be following what to do with a child that had autism. Eustacia had makeup her own track. When people said sit down, be quiet. She spoke up and she stood up. She stood up for her… her daughter and she stood up for all of us. I'm so honor to bring to you and please (inaudible) giving out a big welcome to Eustacia Cutler, one of my favorite mothers in the world.

EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you. Thank you, dear. What a lovely introduction. Oh, wait a minute. I just dropped my glasses. Yes, and my pen. Oh, I can't function without either. Good morning and thank you so much for inviting me here. It's a real treat and I've thought a lot about this because it is a special honor to open a conference and the point of what I'm going to talk about today is to try to invite you to have a new way to look at autism and to look at us. It's a two way street. We're social creatures, we're incomplete without each other. So with that thought, let me start with a story. Long ago when Temple was a little girl, uh… we lived in (inaudible), Massachusetts which was a 300-year-old town outside of Boston. Still very much country with fields, with the children played and woods where they run around and a pond where we all went skating in the winter. And across the road from where we lived, there was a farm and in the farm were hens and in the hen coop, there was a rooster. Well, I used to study all night in those years uh… that's when I was going back to college to finish getting my degree. And it was then that I learned the rooster doesn't just crow when the sun comes up. A rooster crows first at 03:00 A.M. in the morning, in the dark. Now if you remember your Shakespeare, ghosts appear at midnight and they leave at 03˸00 A.M. 03˸00 A.M. is the hour when more people die and more babies are born. It is the hour when we start a new day in the dark. We have no way of knowing what that day is going to bring. There are no answers to autism and to most of life. There are only choices, but know that choices can be changed and you will change them, and you will be changed by them. Change is part of the miracle of life. Yes, we start in the talk, but we change with each choice we evolve and that's part of what I want you to see and think about and what I'm saying. I loved the way that Temple has changed. Because she's had to get out in the world and deal with people, make her contracts with people. Sometimes not even in the language that she speaks and it's made her somebody different from that little girl long ago. Also, we have the great gift of curiosity. We just want to know what's going to happen, that's valuable. Now let me just check my notes here when I wanted to say that I wanted to give you. Oh, yes, I know what it is. It's the fact that Temple will often talk to you about manners that I taught her manners. I thought Gee! I thought I taught her more than manners. Uh… What she means is that I taught her away to present herself to the world. It's not that we want to change our children. I… I mind that business about we're going to make them normal. As it what's normal? A normal for what? That's not the point for our children. It is valuable to teach them how to present themselves to the world. I… I've just met somebody on a spectrum and he presented himself to me wonderfully, perfectly, he held out his hand and we shook hands. That's valuable. I wanted the ways that I taught it to Temple as a little girl and two. I have four children so there were other children listening to this story. It came out of our Kipling's Jungle Book. You remember, Mowgli, the little boy who grew up with the wolves. Well, when I came to read it to my children. I realized that those animals who taught Mowgli about life, were really the Indian servants who taught Rudyard Kipling as a little boy, how to live his life. And one of the pieces of advice comes from Kaa, the snake. Now you have to remember that the snake is an ancient symbol for wisdom and change because the snake sheds its skin and emerges with colors all new and brilliant, a new way to present itself to the world. And Kaa, the snake says to Mowgli, a brave heart and a courteous tongue will carry thee far through the jungle. That's where Temple's manners suddenly took hold. She liked that story. Now let me see what I had here that I wanted next to tell you.

00:12:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Where do we fit into this picture? Because we do, autism is not a puzzle piece. I mind the fact it always illustrated with this little single puzzle piece I think, yeah, well, where are the pieces that fit around it? Where're the other pieces? So we'd better look at them and we'd better look at the culture that we're now living in that our young people on the spectrum are introducing themselves to. And I will read this bit. We are living today in a culture of instant access. Going on a safari, Dr. Google will tell you what shots to get, took a wrong turn to Mineola, a GPS will straighten you out, need a new life partner, uh… virtual has the perfect mate. The Internet is giving us an insatiable appetite for easy answers and there're easy isolated answers. Each one stands alone unrelated to the next answer and that's because the Internet forces us to explore sequentially. Yet, our minds work better when we view various points together, when we can see the relationship of one reality to another reality. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER More important, the Internet distracts us. We constantly interrupt ourselves to check and recheck messages that don't really matter. And then we diagnose our children as attention deficit hyperactivity or you don't see the connection. The internet isn't built to help us to focus. It's built to make money. As a result, we have a culture today that's complicated and shallow. We're too hurried, too exhausted to see the relevance of one reality to another reality. We sing the praises of our spectrum young, we call them all they're special. We tell the world that are autism has expanded our humanity. And in the same breath, we pledge money to the medical world saying 'Please doctors find or secure. Make them more like us.' And we don't see the connection. Our instant access culture has turned us into baby birds with open beaks waiting for answers to be popped into our lives, too comfortable to forage for our own insights. We've also turned autism into a separate subspecies. It's starting to look an awful like the old style than an us. For example, we use the slogan different but not less. If you're as old as I am and if you're checking on me I'm 87. That slogan has a glib echo of the slogan we fought so hard to get over in the 50s. The slogan then was 'Separate but equal' and that meant separate public bathrooms for the blacks, separate schools only they were never equal. We struggled collectively over cultural barriers, Women's Lib, recognizing gays, gay rights to marriage. Now we've added autism to this list. I don't argue with it. It's an honorable battle, but it rides on easy collective thinking. I was interested to hear a young Asperger young man say that he didn't like Asperger being likened to the gay situation. He didn't want to be in that kind of a battle, but we are in that battle. It's one that rides on easy collective thinking. Autism is deep and difficult for child, for family and for community. It demands our best thinking. Well, now having gotten that off my chest. I'd like to go to a little bit of what is that thinking. What's going on between us that's disturbing our children and therefore disturbing us? We don't get them and they don't get us, why? Well, let me introduce myself. I am who I think I am? And I'm also who you think I am. And you are who you think you are. You're also who I think you are. There's a story going on between us and it feels conscious and social, but actually most of it is neurological. Now that's fine for us our neurology is giving it to us for free, but it isn't coming for free for our children. They're (inaudible) they look at this room here and they're good at details better than we are. They will see the pattern of the rug and tell you exactly what that pattern looks like. But they do not understand what's going on between us. It has no physical reality. We're just exchanging a bunch of ideas. That is very confusing to our children. To add to it those ideas are random and fluid. We don't quite know how this day is gonna turn out and that too really troubles our children. They're trying desperately to memorize each moment, even Temple has said she has her own internal videos when she meets a situation she's not sure how to deal with she said 'I take out my videos and find the answer that looks most suitable for that moment.' Well, the moment they're not always quite the same and add to it there's another moment coming and another… and another… and another… and another it doesn't stop. It's not surprising therefore that our children are rigid, that they tried to create systems in which to think, that they have tantrums when it is too much for them. This world is coming at them and it is no way for them to integrate with it, that feature is missing from them. Now to add to it, another feature and that is they have no sense that you and I have different thoughts from theirs. And they can tell you a lot about their thoughts, they can tell you every little incident they ever felt, but they haven't a clue what's going on in our heads and how to make that exchange. Uh… And that's where we're in trouble because we're not getting the response that we're used to getting from other people. We have a child instead who doesn't know who we are, maybe doesn't even recognize that we are a human. I think one mother who described how her daughter always took her hand and put it onto the refrigerator door as if she could use her hand for a tool to open the refrigerator. The mother was wiped out because if people don't know who we are, who are we? Identity, you see, is a two-way street. We're social creatures, we are incomplete without each other. And that's why basic to the autism problems is this disruption of identity. Our children don't know quite who they are, can't figure out what we're up to and we've been wiped out. We think then we must be bad parents or maybe we're just as bad people. Every child babies need a mother to know that there are baby, but every mother needs a baby to know that she's a mother. When that breaks down, mothers are in distress and I can speak feelingly up in now. When it comes to fathers, I think men have a great sense of shame. There's a piece in there about men and honor and shame that's something of what in the handout I see that you have opened there, that's part of the problem for men. And I think always over time at a conference in Texas was right after the Temple Grandin film came out and this big guy comes up to me looks like one of those men who threw (inaudible) balls on Temple's truck. He tries to tell me about his 10-year-old son and she breaks into tears and he asks me to give him a hug, and we hug. And in that moment, I think who is he? Is this a child asking for forgiveness? Is this a teenager who's annoyed and wants out? I decided that it was an SOS. He wants to reclaim his honor, but he knows if he leaves that will be a shameful act. He's trapped. That's part of what the problem is for us.

00:24:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER Now I know that you're going to want to know about how did I raised Temple. Umm… I can't give you the full story because I'm trying to give you some other stories. But there was more of a network than you realize and in many ways it was a one-on-one network and that made it a better network. When Temple was a baby, it started fairly on… fairly early on. It doesn't come over you in a blinding flash, it just slowly creeps over you. And you have to remember that Temple was born in 1947 right after World War II. There had been no babies born during World War II, the men were all fighting. So I'd never even held a baby. I didn't know what to expect from a baby. But this baby didn't want to be held, didn't want to look at me, couldn't play Peekaboo, didn't grab for my necklace and try to stick it in her mouth, instead and she was mute. She would spit and giggle and giggle sort of kind of a meaningless giggle. She would pull her feces out of her diapers and play with it and smear it on the wallpaper. Well, by this time I knew something very serious was wrong. I took her to the Children's Hospital in Boston to the Judge Baker Guidance Clinic. Now we come to another… another two semi… I keep realizing I keep coming up with two sums. The first one being no answers just choices. Now we come to trust and risk. Who am I going to trust and risk in this situation. Now the name of the clinic at Children's Hospital was the Judge Baker Guidance Clinic and I realized there had to have been at that clinic by the way is still… still running today and it still runs under that same name. There had to have been a Judge Baker who saw these children in court and thought let us set up a means of guiding them before they become hopeless then legally known as stubborn child. That meant, we can do nothing with this child, get him out of here, dismissive and Judge Baker must have known that wasn't suitable. The Head of the Clinic was Dr. Bronson Caruthers, who looked very old and important to me. Umm… I suppose (inaudible) he might have been 55, but that looked old to me and he examined Temple and yes, she was diagnosed as autistic. He did three interesting tests. Uh… One was for retardation, one was for brain damage, a third one was for epilepsy. Now if you know your autism history, how do we find out that autism was bioneurological. We stumbled on it by accident in a test about epilepsy and we connected the two and that connection didn't come for another 15 years. This meant, Dr. Caruthers was 15 years ahead of everybody else. Now the other… other point which was only then just beginning to start, but it was mounting. I don't know how many of you know about who… who know who Bruno Bettelheim was? Does that ring a bell with anybody here? I don't see… There's one hand, a couple of hands. Well, make yourselves knowledgeable because those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it. Not in quite the same way, but it gets repeated. Now Bettelheim turned out to be strongly Freudian and Leo Kanner, who is the one who established autism here in this country in 1943 also was Freudian. Basically, you see, they were looking at the symptoms and they were attributing that the cause to the symptom. They didn't understand that they are two separate things. They even… they didn't understand how to look for the cause. So the symptoms were uh… these children have been driven mad by their cold mothers. There were mothers who killed themselves because of Bettelheim. Now what's interesting about New England and the reason I'm going into it is to get you to look at cultures. I've talked to you about the culture today. Now I'm telling you something about the culture in the early 50s when this was mounting this… this… this Bettelheim infatuation was getting… was mounting, was getting worse. But, you see, New Englanders our Yankees they're Puritans. We do not lie down on couches and tell people our troubles. We stand up and we face them, it's a different cultural outlook. Also New Englanders are strong on education. There are more schools in New England per acre than I'll bet in any other part of the country. So what did Dr. Caruthers recommend for Temple? Speech lessons. He did not recommend institutionalizing. He said 'I think she's going to learn to talk, but let's speed up the process,' And he told me who to go to. A Mrs. Reynolds in Belmont, Massachusetts had a little school in her basement. Now again here's a cultural point that came in. This is just before Women's Lib. Women like Mrs. Reynolds and the other women, who helped with Temple. She would have been the Head of a School today and not running a little school in her basement. She taught Temple how to talk. She took hold of her jaw, Temple went to her for three years, three times a week, three hours each session. She took hold of Temple's jaw. She told her where to put her tongue. What was the difference between a P and a B, between a D and a T. It's rather subtle. Temple caught on. I think because she wanted to talk. And as you all know she hasn't stopped talking ever since. Mrs. Reynolds taught her something else equally important. That's where she would have to sit and wait at her little chair for her turn. There were other people in this class, other children. It was her introduction to understanding other people shared communication. They too have problems and they deserve their turn. One of the exercises that I've always admired most is very simple. All these children on the spectrum were told to sit in a circle and take hands with each other. Now will all raise our hands together at the same moment? You can't do it unless you're in agreement with the two people on each side of you. It's a very simple, very early lesson on cooperation, understanding other people have a position and a need and being part of that, being a group. Now after… Let me see I want to get to… Oh, yes! Then after Temple uh… she finally learned to talk, it took until she was nearly five before she learned to talk. She then went to a little summer camp for children who are on the spectrum. Mrs. Huckel who was British, and short and stout, and had a big black velvet tam she worn, a long flowing black velvet pajamas. And she had run a school on the Riviera for the sons of maharajahs. And she was not intimidated by Temple's father. You see it was not the doctor who recommended institutionalizing as it shows in the film, it was Temple's father who wanted Temple institutionalized. Well, he was impressed with Mrs. Huckel, he kind of backed down with her. And Mrs. Huckel said 'Now Temple at the end of my summer here with you, you must have learned two things. You must learn to say the Lord's Prayer. That pretty little girl who's just learned to talk to be able to recite it precisely. And says Mrs. Huckel, 'You must learn always to do your very… very best.' Well, what's valuable? I looked at the Lord's Prayer it didn't dawn on me at the time. It took me quite a while for it to dawn on me. What's interesting is the Lord's Prayer only asks for today's bread. Not an IEP for what's going to happen next year. No, just today. A good rule to remember. The other is asks us to be forgiven for what we've done wrong, but only so long as we forgive those, we think have done something wrong to us. There are two valuable life lessons. And of course, valuable too. She said 'You must always do your very best' and Temple always has. Now at five, Temple was mainstreamed into the Dedham Country Day School a little tiny school where all the children in the neighborhood went and they said 'Yes, we'll take her. We're educators that's what we think we should be doing. And Mrs. Teach was the teacher who took care of Temple. She was in-charge of kindergarten. Temple went in, you see, five years old to kindergarten through third grade. These are crucial years and Mrs. Teach and I agreed that we would talk all the time together. What this produced was consistency and expectation. Another pair of words that are valuable. Temple learned that whatever happened at school somehow her mother seem to know it and then what happened at school mm… If what happened at home, Mrs. Teach know it. It held Temple to a consistent behavior that was expected from her. How she would present herself to this class and it worked and Temple was very happy there. And she was part of the neighborhood group of children what we forget is, children have their culture. It's a little different from ours. There they are much more direct with one another. Umm… I'm sure they told Temple, she was weird and she probably told them to shut up. Uh… But what she learned was and she said she said (inaudible) she said they had rules in the games and I learned that if I didn't follow the rules I wouldn't be included in the game. By separating these children, separating them out, we lose that. We lose the fact that they each learned from each other as children. They… they accepted Temple and she accepted them, and they each had to (inaudible) kind of get together on that. I think that's something we should pay more attention to now. If I have time I'll give you a little bit more on that. But for the moment, I want to get into uh… what happened that adolescent when Temple got thrown out of the older school, she'd been sent to. This little Dedham Country Day School only went through sixth grade, thrown out in a very cruel way and that's a whole story in itself that one makes me angry every time I tell it. But what happened which was the gift of luck. I was doing research for a WGBH documentary on what were then called Disturbed Children. And it was hitting particularly on the problem of teenagers. I visited every teenage school for those on the spectrum from Maine down to Rhode Island. And I'd seen quite a lot of very… very good schools, I was amazed at them. It was a whole education for me. So I could say to Temple 'I picked out three schools.' And here's the other advantage, you see, when you go as a journalist. I didn't tell the school that I had a daughter on the spectrum because I knew they change their answers. I just went with my notebook. How you present yourself, what are the circumstances of the presentation effect what will be said what's your learn. Well, the long and the short is I've found three schools I thought were tops. And I said Temple 'You and I will go visit those schools and you can pick out the school you would like to go to.' I wanted her to have a hand in her destiny. She was 14 and that's very I think that's fairly crucial at about that age that they begin to have a sense of making their own choices in life. And I knew that I would be okay with any of those three schools. Uh… Temple picked Hampshire Country School. Where there were… Where there was a farm it had a lot that was familiar. Where there were cows and horses. It was horses she was interested in, in those years. And I was very much drawn to the headmaster of that school man named Henri Petit, who taught me as well as Temple. You see each of these steps and this is true for all young parents. It's a journey you take together, you are both learning, you both have to be guided and I believe strongly in that. Henri Petit guided me when Temple didn't do any work for two years and I was worried schoolwork by that, I mean, she… she did farm work and took care of the horses. But I wasn't so much pushing for academic excellence, but wondering why she'd stopped studying. Henri Petit you said 'Leave her alone. Let her get through adolescence.' It doesn't matter if it takes another couple of years for her to finish high school. And it did, it took her six years to do four years. And when she got through her adolescence that's when she found her beloved Mr. Carlock, the science teacher, who was a local science teacher, who had been trained in autism. You see, you have to put all these little puzzle pieces together very carefully. Now several things had happened in the meantime. The first, I guess was or the first I'll tell you. I went back to the Judge Baker Gardens Clinic by this time old Dr. Caruthers had retired and the Viennese psychiatrist Dr. (inaudible) was no longer an intern there. Uh… And Bettelheim… the Bettelheim attitude was obvious as soon as I sat down I knew I was the enemy. And I've written about this in a funny way because sometimes comedies a way of getting on top of something. Giving the appearance that you don't really understand, while at the same time you are listening to them because you understand all too well and there's instance though I wasn't interested in being entertaining. They said 'Well, Temple should come to their school.' I said 'But your school is right here in the middle of the city. She's used to the country. She'd like to go to this country school.' Well, they said 'But we'll be able to monitor her' that was what triggered my choice, monitor her. Monitor is not a kind word. How is Temple to know that maybe she isn't being dismissed once again for being a difficult child. I got up, I picked up my coat and I left and I don't know what the record says to this day and I don't care. Bettelheim in the end turned out to be a fraud. He had none of the degrees he said he had. It was all, we were all of us taken for a ride. Now what had happened in the meantime to Dr. (inaudible) the Viennese doctor who'd seen Temple from the age of 2 until I guess she was 16 or so. There's… there's a big stretch of years in there and I saw him too, so we all took this journey together. And at first said 'He had (inaudible) those little shop (inaudible) Accents' you know, with lots of Ss that made him sound like a World War II Nazi villain. And when I came, you know, and he stood up and he was smaller than I was and I could see that it annoyed him. And then after and this… this spread over these years. After a couple of years, he said 'But you know, Temple has been psychotic, but now she's coming out a bit and she's beginning to be neurotic.' I said Oh, yeah, well, like us?' He's not amused when I say that. Then, little later a couple of years more he said, you know, he begins to change and be curious. Uh… 'I do not understand why she got ill and I do not understand why is she getting well.' Now then a couple more years and again how luck plays into things where two little girls in school became best friends. His daughter and Temple's sibling. Now he'd watched these two little girls play together and he said to me 'I do not understand why is this not in the other children.' I've always loved Temple's remark about the Dr. (inaudible) she said 'Well, I never told him anything important.' He wasn't looking for her childhood secrets. He was watching the changes in her behavior and he too was changing. He had come from a Viennese culture, a Freudian culture that was autocratic and precise. He come to a new country, he was racing his children in a new country. Suddenly, what he thought he understood was shifting under him. It didn't look to be quite what he thought it was. And who was he interning for that all the Yankee, Dr. Bronson Caruthers. I've always wondered what those two men said to each other. You see, it's a complicated journey to see how many facets of it are playing into the picture and it's not just one puzzle piece. Now when Temple wanted to go to college uh… by the time she had gotten back into studying, the problem was she… she couldn't take an exam. It was too much for her nervously. But now here's Henri Petit and 25 minutes away was Franklin Pierce College and Frank DiPietro, who was President of the College. And of course, these two academics were good friends with each other. They sat down together and thought let's figure out how Temple can go to college without entrance exams. We will take her (inaudible) says Frank DiPietro and let's see how it goes. She will have to come back to Hampshire School to Henri Petit and to Mr. Carlock the science teachers so that we keep… we keep building this. What I'm trying to show you see is how these it's a one-on-one picture. I don't… I… I believe in one-on-one. They made between them this exception for Temple to go to Franklin Pierce College and it worked, and she graduated fourth in a class of 400, pretty good record. People say 'What's the proudest moment? I think at that time the proudest moment was her graduation honors. She then wanted to go to get her MA. She wanted to go to Arizona State University, but she couldn't do math. Now again what's interesting to note in this is as I said to you when we were beginning, our children cannot deal with abstract thought. What's traveling back and forth between us that has no actual physical phenomenon reality. What couldn't Temple do? She couldn't do algebra. What have you got in algebra? You've got symbolic thinking. You've got an X and it's going to stand for what you don't know. That's very hard for any… any person on the spectrum. They have real trouble with symbolic thinking. Arizona State University made an exception, they let her take something different. Now and she went, she graduated. She went on and got her Ph.D. Two things are important to remember, Temple was privately educated from the age of two through her Ph D. But Datum Country Day School that little school there in Datum, Datum has now become a very stylish suburb. Much more uh… impressed with itself than it was in those early years. They now will not take a child on a spectrum. We send… Oh, no, we're not equipped, we send those children to that special school over on the other side of town, which means you take that child out of her neighborhood, where she's going to school with the same children's she's playing with. That's… I don't think that's a good solution. See this is the when the other question people keep asking me is what changes do you see in autism now? I see that it has become professionalized and others a lot of money being made in it. And I'm not always comfortable with that. I think of the… the crisis in the mortgages in this country and I wonder how many of those mortgages were made to pay for a child to go to a special school, that's cultural and it's regrettable. It's worse than regrettable. It's very close to obscene. We cannot allow autism to be a business. Now how do we get to the main stream, that's the next point? We have got to educate the mainstream. That's and it's not complicated. It's not rocket science. It… Everybody seems to make it into something much more elaborate and what it is. It's pretty much what I just told you and I'll now tell you a little more. Because umm… because it's what I told it to a school in New York where I had gone to see an art class for… for children on the spectrum that's why I had to call the Principal of the School, now this is not a good school. In New York, we have schools that are not so good. This school is one jump ahead of jail. This school they told me, don't walk down a corridors alone. I thought okay. But the… the principal said 'Yes, I'll give you permission,' but she said 'You know, we don't really know anything about autism. The city's given us some money, but nobody told us what to do with it.' I said 'Okay, I'll give you a crash course on autism. ' Every teacher in that school came to my amazement and when we… And it was only an hour but at the end of just an hour, they said 'It's kinda (inaudible) of belief' and they said 'Oh! Oh! Now we've got some idea of how to proceed with this.' So I'll give you my crash course. And it starts with… Wait a minute I have to get my notes here to make sure I'm in the right place. 

00:52:50
[sil.] 

00:52:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, here it is. It starts with a story again about my youngest grandson. I have five grandsons. And they're all in their twenty's now. Big tall strapping young men who are still children. I'm very aware of that. As I was when I was a child by 20s. But at this point Nicholas, the youngest was in (inaudible) and he hadn't begun we've tried to figure out when and I'm chancier forgotten when children start to talk. And as far as I was concerned it was the first time I'd heard Nicholas talk. It was not mamma, dada. He was sitting in his high chair where we got things to eat and he pointed to the cookie jar and he looked at us and he said 'Oreo.' Well, yeah, we all laughed. But I knew before this baby could talk the neurology was complete. First-place, he had the idea of something, the idea of… of… of a cooking what you do with it. With a lot of these children on the spectrum, you can say 'Point to the shovel' and the child can point to it. If you say to the child, point to the thing you dig with? They are lost. They can't put the idea of what you do with something, together with the object. And it doesn't have anything to do with speech because Nicholas could do this before he could speak. He put it together. Now the next thing he did was he understood where he was that's… that's conceptual thinking if you want the legitimate name for it, conceptual thinking. Now comes context, where was he? He was sitting in his high chair, where he already understood this is the place where he gets things to eat and if you wanted a cookie, he understood he was going to eat it. He better speak up fast before somebody takes him out of that high chair. What's valuable about context is, it is a direct path to relevance. How two ideas fit together and are relevant to each other. A lot of our people on the spectrum have real trouble with relevance. I think of Jerry Newport, who I like so much he's got to be umm… probably well past 50 by now. And if you meet Jerry and he's one who… when he saw the movie of Rain Man, he could shout out the answer to the… the Vegas uh… equations in the movie and people said 'Oh, you've seen this movie.' He didn't know that it was unusual that he already knew the answer. If… if you meet him, he'll ask you 'Well, when were you born? And you tell them the date of your birth and he tells you the day of the week you were born. Well, that's sort of interesting but the truth is I don't really care. Now you look at Bill Gates, he probably has much the same kind of mind, big difference Bill Gates understands relevance. So Bill Gates is a zillionaire and Jerry drives a cab, very important relevance. Now the next thing… Oh, yes, here's what I want to get to the next thing that Nicholas' words showed was shared information. He already understood that we had a different mind from his and he would get that idea of the cookie from his mind into our minds because he knew he would need help and he knew where the cookies where, he pointed to the cookie jar. That's share and he looked at us. This is eye contact. When you wonder why our young people on the spectrum have trouble with eye contact. Is because they don't know what… what are we sharing when we look at each other? These are all abstracts. They're… they're nothing that you can put your finger on, that's hard for our children. Now the next thing is of course, he… he That's… so that play eye contact, executive function is the technical word. Nicholas could put it all together. Now a lot of this is in animal life and I have to tell you the squirrel story. All of you who have dogs and cats, know about eye contact with animals. They're big dogs, big on it. There, you know, you say 'Oh, don't catch his eye, he'll come over and beg for food or beg to be let out or beg for whatever it is he thinks he wants at that particular moment.' Maybe just attention. Uh… But it's eye contact he does it with. Cats, people say cats are unaffectionate Yes, they are. They just do it differently. They look at you differently. Their… their need to connect with you is established in a little different way. Now in the wild, two animals who stare at each other, it's considered a sign of belligerents and one animal has got to back down and that's for the squirrel story comes. This is when we were living out, so we'd left Massachusetts we were living outside of New York City in an old carriage house, and stone barn, and dairy and it had all wide stone windowsills, particularly outside of the kitchen. And I used to put bird feed out on the windowsill and the birds came and ate it. And so did this one particular squirrel. He particularly liked the sunflower seeds and he leave the other stuff for the little birds. Well, he… he knew I would let him eat there on that windowsill. By this time, I was married again and it required two more children so I had six children to feed, that's lot of groceries. And I would get everything for one week, pack up the car than a bring it home and I had to unpack the car, so I'd come in and in those days the groceries all came in paper bags, open paperbacks. I came in with a bunch of groceries and set them down on the floor and went back to get the next bunch of groceries. Now in that first bunch was an open bag of cookies, Toll House Cookies. The squirrel clearly smelled them because when I came back with a second load, he had come into the kitchen. He had gotten into the bag of cookies. Well, we stared at each other. I thought, we've got two cats and a dog in this house, we're going to have mayhem and murder, and I don't want either. So I'm not quite sure what to do. It was the longest stare I've ever experienced. And then the squirrel done. He did, the squirrel equivalent of a slow walk at high noon. He did not run away he just said… 'I guess you're the alpha animal and yes, I am on your territory and I guess these are your cookies and I guess I'd also like to be friends with you I'd like still to eat those sunflower seeds.' Slowly he got out and he slowly hopped across the floor and out the window. Wow! I looked the other day at a picture of Putin in the paper and I thought he looks exactly like that squirrel. And he's in exactly the same position. (inaudible) its a little scary. The researcher who put it best as Antonio Damasio, who said 'We are not the thinking beings who feel. We are feeling beings who think.' The mind is in the service of the body, by that he meant the neurological body. While he said this out a lecture in New York and somebody in the queue and he said what about free wills, have we got any free will and Dr. Damasio said 'A little, but not as much as we would like to have.' So that's my… my squirrel story and something to bear in mind. Now the next thing we have to cover. Because I want to have some questions here. So I'll be quick about this last two, systemizing and empathizing. And I… I think I don't know how much all of you know about this, but systemizing is our way of handling the inanimate world. It means mathematics, architecture, music, statistics anything that can't be reduced to statistics, they all come under systemizing. We need it as I think not in the animal world, I think always of the way we count. Uh… We count in tens because we have ten fingers that's easy to understand. Yeah, well, where did zero come from? There is no such thing. It doesn't exist. Yeah, you put it into a mathematical system and you can build the pyramids. Well, the Egyptians say that they invented zero and they did build the pyramids. The Arabs say they invented zero and we count in Arabic numbers. They probably both invented it. And whoever invented it was probably an Asperger, important to remember. Now opposite of systemizing comes empathizing. How many of you know about mirror neurons? Does that ring a bell with you? Nobody… nobody knows. Oh, a couple of hands. It's important to know. Empathy is a little different from sympathy. Sympathy is I see a man with only one leg and I think that would be very hard to have only one leg, but if you cut your finger and I see it I felt… I actually feel the cut that's what mirror neurons, so they're neurons that imitate what happens in somebody else. And I feel strongly about them because I'm someone who thinks that the sight of blood. Now I don't know why should you bleed and I faint. It doesn't make sense. But it is a neurological fact. It's the way we function. Now manner better that systemizing than women are. And women are better at empathizing than men are. And that's probably because we raise children, we bear them and we raise them. The point is, we need both. It's what makes men tender and women brave. So we need to put the two together. But another doctor that you should study regretfully the list is not there, the books that I recommend. So I will try to get it to you by another means. But Dr. VS Ramachandran has felt that autism is a… is a disorder of the mirror neuron system. I've always felt that autism is rather than a disorder is more like a hair lip now you all know you… you look at McDonalds Smile Train pictures and you can see that the hair lip comes in a lot of different versions. There's nothing actually wrong, the facial constellation didn't finish coming together. Now if you look at your own face, you see, we've got a cupid's bow here and if you're Cary Grant and lucky you got a cleft chin here. That's the constellation coming together. Now when you've got a hair lip, you can have either a little neck that can be repaired with surgery and that's what McDonald's is doing. It comes in all varieties if you look at these pictures they're all different. And there are different levels of seriousness. They go all the way from a little nick to a cleft palate, which is really serious and I don't know what you do with a cleft palate. To me autism is in a sense, an incompletion of the neurological constellation. It didn't quite finish coming together do you get me and therefore you're going to have a lot of different variety, you'll get good responses for some things and… and incomprehension at other levels. And that's why it confuses us so much because we don't always know how to deal with it. It's why I believe so deeply in identity and if you're wondering about the name of my book A Thorn in My Pocket. My darling, Temple is not the thorn, the thorn is identity. And it came out of the fact that when I went back to Harvard, Theodore Morrison took me into his creative writing course, which was a great honor. I… I was stunned, and pleased and very anxious. And I said to Mr. Morrison, 'This makes me anxious. I'm returning to college I don't know if I can do it.' Now he was a close friend of the poet, Robert Frost. And Robert Frost, who said came late to lecturing and it made him nervous and he told Mr. Morrison, he always carried something in his pocket. He could touch when he was talking. So he would remember who he was and then he said 'These days it's a thorn.' So that thorn is identity and yes, I've got time I gotta tell you this part of the story too. As you probably know, Julia Ormond won an Emmy for her portrayal of me. And she turned up one day at a conference where I was getting an award. And I was told she was going to give me the award and I could see it sitting there this beautiful Plexiglas award. So she gives it to me and we smile and bow at each other. And Julia said 'Now I have something to give you. That's very hard for me to give you, but if my daughter can come and touch it once in a while I have a doorstop for you and out of a bag, she pulled her MA, that MA is going to go to the Brain Institute outside of New York City where mothers come first bringing their child and their anxiety, and it will be in a frame to greet them when they walk in to know that it is for them, that award, for all of you, for mothers. Now before I finish up I got time for some questions. And what I'd like to do is if you're brave enough uh… to come up here and share this mike with me because I can't possibly hear you from the floor and probably other people will have trouble hear you too. So if you've got something you'd like to ask me, come forward. Are you all so timid? Oh, no… no… no… no. Somebody's got something… something you didn't understand that I said. Okay, hop up. As you're doing this to me are you imitating me? Here comes somebody. And if you… if you get in a little line behind her, we'll take as many as I have time for. And then I'm going to finish up. I'll give you a choice. I will either tell you about what happened with Temple's father which is a dark story. Or I give you an up ending which is a little shorter and an upper story. Yes. 

01:11:40
BARBARA BROWN Please to meet you. My name is Barbara. 

01:11:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER You're gonna eat that mike. It's not an ornament. Its… it's for them to hear you. 

01:11:45
BARBARA BROWN I have a soft voice, okay. 

01:11:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible). 

01:11:50
BARBARA BROWN My name is Barbara Brown and I'm the grandmother of a child on a spectrum disorder. He was inadvertently overdosed. He was given Bactrim and not Bactrim I'm sorry… 

01:12:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible). You need to get to the question. 

01:12:10
BARBARA BROWN Well, I don't know that… Well, okay, Umm… He was in a coma and when he came out the coma for lack of a better word, he was primitive. 

01:12:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, that I've heard that story before. It's… it's not unusual. 

01:12:20
BARBARA BROWN Okay. 

01:12:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Okay, but what's your question. 

01:12:25
BARBARA BROWN The mother did not want behavior therapy or anything so what I did with this child is that I just gave him hugs and love, and eventually this child came back to be enable to sit at the table, to stand erect and not a tech people. And my question is love, hugs and… 

01:12:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well… 

01:12:50
BARBARA BROWN (inaudible) everything. He… 

01:12:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, he didn't lose it. He got buried for awhile. 

01:12:55
BARBARA BROWN He got buried, yeah. 

01:12:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER I would think the… the trouble is with love (inaudible) you need more than that. Because we all love our children. The question is what can we do at a particular point that's valuable. At that moment just your touch brought him back. 

01:13:15
BARBARA BROWN Mine and two other nurses. It took three of us. 

01:13:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER Okay, you each… you each did it that's wonderful. And he needed that human contact to… to restore him, to bring him back into life. And very brave of you. 

01:13:30
BARBARA BROWN Oh, thank you. 

01:13:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you. 

01:13:35
BARBARA BROWN Okay. 

01:13:35
UNKNOWN I want to just start by giving you a hug and thank you for being here. 

01:13:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER We too love so hugging. 

01:13:45
UNKNOWN Umm… I'm a librarian with Asperger's and I'm in the Higher Ed environment like Temple and it's been a very good umm… work environment for me. I wanted to just ask you about umm… romantic relationships. I am 29 years old and I have never been in a romantic relationship before. And I've had so and I'm not trying to brag, but I've had so much success in other areas of my life, like, you know, being an academic professional, living alone, being financially independent and yet I have not crossed the threshold of evolving romantically and I wanted to know umm… your Temple's experience with this. I haven't, you know, heard this aspect of her life and I'm not trying to be nosy. But it's a… it's a real frustration for me developmentally. 

01:14:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes, it is. 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN I was curious about her evolution in that aspect. 

01:14:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER I think she walked away from it. She's always said 'I'm celibate.' 

01:14:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:14:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Uh… That's a hard choice. Again these are choices uh… and there isn't going to be a precise way for you to find your way with somebody. Uh… But you are very intelligent and that's a great help, you'll be able to assess. Can you… can you assess people when you meet them? 

01:15:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, I… I get along with people. I… I have friends but it's never… 

01:15:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Can you assess her? 

01:15:25
UNKNOWN It's often very hard for me to tell a lot of it is nonverbal. And I don't do well with that. I… when… when they don't tell me their feelings and they don't respond to me uh… it's very difficult to… to read what the message is from them. 

01:15:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, and they're having trouble too because they don't know the message precisely? 

01:15:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:15:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER And the only thing you can do is lay that out to them and say 'Do you want to help me?' 

01:16:00
UNKNOWN It's just a really… So you're saying basically, Temple just gave up. 

01:16:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes. She decided she wouldn't get… She would not get involved and we've never talked about it further. She said that publicly in lectures that she's celibate. 

01:16:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

01:16:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER But it's a very real problem. 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:16:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER On a road we each go alone. 

01:16:25
UNKNOWN There's no easy answer. 

01:16:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER No, there isn't. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN So. 

01:16:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you. 

01:16:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. I appreciate it. 

01:16:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you. We got nobody else has a question? Oh, there! Oh, my God! I thought why… why has nobody here. Okay. 

01:16:45
MAINE MACKENZIE Hi, my name is Maine Mackenzie. And I wanted to ask you about your other children. How did you help them have a sibling who was so unusual? 

01:16:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, that's a very good question. And I have to dance around it a little bit because my other children are asked to be left out of the story. 

01:17:05
MAINE MACKENZIE Okay. 

01:17:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Uh… Two things come to my mind. I love forever Mrs. Teach that first teacher at DCD. 

01:17:10
MAINE MACKENZIE Mm-hmm. 

01:17:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER We had an agreement that I told you about. We had an agreement that if Temple had a bad day, she could go home and I would come and get her. Well, she did have bad days and Mrs. Teach use that time to teach the other children in the class what Temple's trouble was. I was too young and I didn't know how to do that. And I talk about what I was just saying to this gentleman. Words are hard to come by when you… when you're not sure what it is you're even talking about. 

01:17:45
MAINE MACKENZIE Mm-hmm. 

01:17:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER But I now would say to anybody when people ask me what would you do over? That you what you know now, I do better by the siblings. 

01:17:55
MAINE MACKENZIE Mm-hmm. 

01:17:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER They're fine, and they're all smart, and they're all productive and they're all loving. 

01:18:00
MAINE MACKENZIE Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

01:18:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER But what I did learn along the way was, it's important to save a little time for all your… each of your other children alone for them and it doesn't have to be fancy. It can be something as simple as come on, you and I will get dinner together, everybody else out of the kitchen. And I love forever the mother said… The mother who told me she said' Oh, my daughter and I we go and get our toenails done together. 

01:18:30
MAINE MACKENZIE Oh, you… 

01:18:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Anything. 

01:18:30
MAINE MACKENZIE Anything. 

01:18:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Now the other thing I think that's important is a counselor for siblings. Because siblings will tell a counselor what they won't tell their mother. Because they know their mother's upset and if the children also may not have the words, again the… the words are hard to come by and the counselor that I liked the most had a huge dollhouse with every kind of doll and furniture, everything you could do to make up a beautiful dollhouse and she'd say 'It's yours you can make the scenes.' 

01:19:10
MAINE MACKENZIE Mm-hmm. 

01:19:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER She said 'She found the scenes they made.' I told her what the problem was. 

01:19:15
MAINE MACKENZIE Mm-hmm. 

01:19:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER And she knew then how to work. But it's a very… Thank you for bringing up the question because it's a very important question. 

01:19:25
MAINE MACKENZIE I (inaudible) it is too. Thank you, very much. 

01:19:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible) okay. 

01:19:30
PETER It's so good to meet you. Hi, umm… my name is Peter. Umm… You mentioned the Lord's Prayer. 

01:19:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah. 

01:19:40
PETER And I was wondering if you believe in God and if you do I… I've always wondered and I've always just thought about it. What is He thinking when it comes to autism? 

01:19:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER You see, okay, here I tell you quite frankly. Yes, I… we're spiritual creatures I don't know how precisely and I don't need to know. And I think man-made theology is very tricky and as we can all know right now it causes wars which has exactly the opposite of what we should be doing as creatures of spirit. We want a precise answer. There isn't one. Now I like the fact I remember talking to a man on the plane, we told each other our stories and he was in the financial business. After awhile, he told me he said 'You know, I was a priest for many years and then I left because I couldn't stand the loneliness of the life.' Then we began to talk about just what you're asking and he said 'The old Hebrew word "e-lohim" means that which cannot be described. That's as good an answer as I can give you. 

01:21:05
PETER Thank you. 

01:21:10
[sil.] 

01:21:15
BECKY Hi! 

01:21:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER Hi! 

01:21:15
BECKY I'm Becky. Mainly I just wanted to come up here because I think about 52 minutes ago I fell in love with you and so I just (inaudible) I'm an educator with a national school system and we have a team here and I think what we want to know is from a parent perspective, we get into a lot of situations where it's us against them and we don't like that situation because we want all of us to be for the child. Umm… How would you help us? 

01:21:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER It doesn't always work that way. 

01:21:45
BECKY Exactly! 

01:21:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER I've been there. 

01:21:45
BECKY (inaudible) bad guys all the time, you know, we're… we're the good guys and we want to be the good guys. 

01:21:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible) turn guys. Well, sometimes you see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 

01:22:00
BECKY Okay. 

01:22:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER So you have to do with this also denial. 

01:22:10
BECKY Yeah. 

01:22:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER There's also rage. There's also determination to prove that my child has extraordinary! 

01:22:20
BECKY Right. 

01:22:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, I think… I think one mother who said 'My son has written beautiful poetry. Let me send it to you.' I said 'Please, don't.' Because I had an appointment to go see talk to the principal of the school with her. 

01:22:30
BECKY Yeah. 

01:22:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER And I knew I was in trouble. We are into the (inaudible) problem. 

01:22:35
BECKY Exactly. 

01:22:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, she sent me the poetry anyway. It was quite bad. To put it bluntly, her son was not the genius that she thought he was. And he had not completed his high school graduation. The school itself would seem to me a very sensible answer. Okay, he can take this on… on the Internet and we will examine him and we'll give him a full graduation credit if he does this. She wouldn't. She said 'No, I want the credit anywhere.' Well, she was wrong. I thought the teacher offered a very good solution. So God bless you and wish you luck. 

01:23:20
BECKY Thank you… thank you. 

01:23:25
JESSICA Hello, I'm Jessica and I'm a mother of a 11-year-old uh… high-functioning autistic child and I have three children. And I'm wondering how you handled, I correlate with you in a movie because I much push him so hard to be the best person he could possibly be and achieve his goals. How did you help her overcome that the anger outbursts and if when she got so frustrated, were you able to help her through that and overcome that anger. 

01:23:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER That's… that's a good question. I… You're going to have to work at it as best you can. But I think what our children don't need is to be pushed. 

01:24:05
JESSICA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Temple always talks about I forgot I use the word challenged. She calls it something else. She said that I did ask for more from her. Uh… Because challenge strikes her as a little bit threatening. 

01:24:20
JESSICA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER There is a threat in there and it's a delicate balance of trying to offer a menu to our children because we say 'Oh, let them do what they want to do.' Well, they don't know what they want to do, quite frankly. 

01:24:40
JESSICA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER But if we offer menus of opportunity like same like Temple, you can pick the school you wanna go to. And I make bargains with her. 

01:24:50
JESSICA Okay. 

01:24:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER With all my children. I mean, this isn't just for children on the spectrum uh… with all my children and I love the fact that one of my daughters that she heard herself saying it to her children, 'When there was no bargain to be made.' I'd say 'Okay, this is what we're going to do. You want it nice or you want to cross.' I'll do it either way. 

01:25:15
JESSICA Mm-hmm. 

01:25:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER They understood that and… and it took… it took the sting out of it. 

01:25:20
JESSICA Okay. Again (inaudible) back. 

01:25:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes, that will give him a little… little leeway like the squirrel, you see, the squirrel had to be allowed to leave the kitchen with his dignity. It's so weird, but it's so humor. So good luck. 

01:25:40
JESSICA Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 

01:25:50
EMILY MARSH Hi, my name is Emily Marsh. Umm… I was just wondering as far as discipline is concerned. Umm… What are your thoughts on spanking as compared to taking away privileges? I mean, I guess, you know, it far between obviously, but you know. 

01:26:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Skip the physical. 

01:26:10
EMILY MARSH Right. With the over stimulation because (inaudible). 

01:26:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER I think it is fair enough and apparently I forgotten it, but Temple says that I took away television when they shouldn't do certain things. I'd say 'Okay, now Howdy Doody.' 

01:26:20
EMILY MARSH Right. 

01:26:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Which was the show then. We didn't have a lot of choices then. 

01:26:25
EMILY MARSH Right… right exactly. 

01:26:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER But yeah, don't… don't do the physical. 

01:26:25
EMILY MARSH Because they need to have that visual, more of a visual field too and overstimulation (inaudible). 

01:26:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Also again its expectation. 

01:26:35
EMILY MARSH Right. 

01:26:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER It's I expect you to behave in a certain way and if you don't I'm afraid we're going to have to have a little… little of something that like to do. 

01:26:40
EMILY MARSH Right. Okay… okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.

JESSICA Hi, I'm Jessica and you mentioned that autism has become a business. 

01:27:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes, it has. 

01:27:05
JESSICA And this is something I'm still very near to the club. My son has only been recently diagnosed, but umm… I have discovered that quickly and it… it makes me very angry. Umm… Do you have ideas of what we can do in our communities? 

01:27:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER I think the more you come together as a community because first of all we have to put it on the table. A lot of times people won't talk about something. Well, if we don't talk about it, we don't know what it is. You have to put and say 'They're on the table.' This is not a suitable way to raise children particularly children on the spectrum. Uh… Yes, there's too much money being made. I might add the same for the pharmaceutical companies. It's obscene what they're making. 

01:28:00
JESSICA Thanks. Thank you. 

01:28:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER I'm going to keep running through because I see this line. We'll see what we can get through here. Well come up. Because then… 

01:28:15
SAM WAX Hello, my name is Sam Wax. I'm 19 diagnosed high-functioning autism. Umm… As in relation to awareness just autism awareness it seems as affairs people are becoming more and more aware especially my generation and younger people of a fact that it exists but they don't seem to be able to make the connection between just it being a word and… 

01:28:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER No. Well, see… see there are two things have happened here. One people want credit for being sympathetic. It doesn't mean they really are sympathetic. Uh… We also have romanticized autism. You look at the heroes on television, we've got Doc Martin, we've got Monk, we've got Big Bang Theory and we've got House, these are all heroes on the spectrum, not really honest ones. We're just romantic… we're putting it up to make it work for a story. I think we have to work at this and we have to work through the mainstream and that's a tough one.

SHARON My name is Sharon and uh… ever since my daughter's been a toddler uh… our pediatrician had said that he thought she had autism. So he sent us to a specialist, who did an assessment. And his assessment said that she had ADHD… 

01:30:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, Attention Deficit. Yeah… yeah… yeah. 

01:30:15
SHARON And he also said that he's seen signs of Asperger's but he wouldn't diagnosed. 

01:30:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER You know, you pay no attention to the diagnosis. 

01:30:25
SHARON Okay. 

01:30:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER They're just a bunch of letters. You're going to have to work with him. The only thing that diagnosis gives the people our rights to certain schooling, but they don't really mean anything as (inaudible) attention deficit as he has… (inaudible) that's what I'm leading up to is. I'm sorry if I hadn't anticipated it. But it's absurd and it's also a money maker. 

01:30:55
SHARON (inaudible). 

01:30:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER And we… I… I think what you've done to decide me I'm going to finish up by reading my passage on limbo. And we will not look to the bad past, but to the good future. Okay, quickie can we cover your… Is that all your… 

01:31:10
SHARON Oh, I just wanna what should I do to make sure she gets the education and help that she needs with the school. I mean, she has IEP for the ADHD. Is there anything else… 

01:31:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, (inaudible) I don't know. Don't go, don't sign an IEP, go with somebody, take it home, say that's interesting. I'll… I'll look at it and think about it. Because… See it's… it's… it's a bit of a trick and it's saying this is what's convenient for us to do for your child. I'm not interested in convenience. 

01:31:50
SHARON I want her to have the best education… 

01:31:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER I want her to have the best education and I realized I was lucky. There was money in… in the family. It was taken away from me after Temple's father proved… tried to prove I was insane and take all of my four children away from me, which he wasn't able to do, but he was able to take the money away. But up till then I had the money and that talks. The other thing that talks is knowing how to talk to doctors and how to talk to teachers. If you don't, they'll walk all over you. So don't go to an IEP alone. I'm going to have to stop in… But okay, let him. I can do one more. Then… then we're going to have to finish. 

01:32:45
LEON HORTON My name is Leon Horton. I told you earlier breakfast that you were an inspiration to me. I'm also professional clinical therapist counselor. And one of my passions is the parents as special needs. I have an autistic child. You've mentioned three things. One is that a mother need to know she's a mother and that's something that's missed a lot, I think. 

01:33:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes, they don't realize it. 

01:33:05
LEON HORTON The other two things that you've just mentioned is the parents need to learn how to understand and talk to teachers as well as professional physicians. What is something else that I could take back to my clients to empower them. I work with groups and I'm working with individuals. And there are so many that are so, feel like they are so alone, feel like they're abandoned, feel like they're in this world all alone and that's something that I become very passionate going know you're not. 

01:33:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER You're not… Well, you're hitting on yeah, right where the difficulty is and why I'm going to read the thing called Limbo. Again I haven't got the answer. I just know we have to look at it and once we've looked at it, once you tell that to the mother that in itself gives her strength. 

01:33:55
LEON HORTON mm-hmm. It did me. 

01:34:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER It's… it's a very difficult tricky role. So I am going to cut it off at that and read Limbo. Sorry, catch me later. I'm here till tomorrow morning at 10:30. This is a passage called Limbo. I looked it up in Webster's Dictionary. It means 'The abode of souls barred from heaven through no fault of their own. A place of confinement or a place a condition of neglect or oblivion,' that's Webster's words. We've all been there that abode where we struggle with the needs of our child caused through no fault of our own or our child's. A place of social isolation, a condition of neighborly neglect or oblivion, trapped, hedged in by a path that defies explanation. We accept what the world tells us, we're supposed to feel. You must love your child, the world says and intermittently we do. As my wise daughter-in-law said 'It's easy to love people when they're lovable, not so easy when they're not.' The inconstancy throws us off. If floods us with a raging shame only in private do parents ask me did I ever get angry? What do I do with these feelings they ask? How do I take care of my child and hold myself together? Their old feelings, old questions, they turn up in Psalm 42. Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted in me? Long ago, I thought those words were about those on the autism spectrum. Now I know they're about us and with it comes another question, how do I cope with the physical task of caring for my child and at the same time present myself to the world as a world says 'I'm supposed to be.' The world says 'My child is a gift, a special gift that will transform me into a deeper more meaningful person,' but that's not happening. My child is driving me crazy. My child is isolating me from the world. So in order to join the World and have my neighbors think well of me, in place of love I will substitute glory. I will glorify my child. I will praise every step forward. I will tell the world, my child is special. And our children trapped in autism self absorption assume the assigned role. In truth we've given them no other choice. Out of our own need, we've created a role playing partnership. Our children are special, we are noble and the neighbors out of their need for approval accept the partnership. They too find our children a handful, they too have feelings, they don't want to say out loud. And so with mutual consent, we construct Limbo where all of us excused, where all of us there through no fault of our own, the setup feels safe, but it is not. Limbo is a static condition, a place where nothing grows, it only repeats. 

01:38:00
[sil.] 

01:38:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER The setup reminds me of an old dog racing story and the days when they used to race (inaudible). The oval track and the starting gun were the same as that of a horserace, only instead of a jockey with whip, there was a mechanical rabbit set to scamper ahead of the dogs, always just out of reach. In this particular race, the bell clanged, the… the gates opened and the dog sprang out after the mechanical rabbit. All except for one dog, he's stopped, he looked at the track. He saw that it circled around, he ran around the track the other way, met the rabbit and chewed it up. He didn't win, race tracks are about betting, they're not about insight. But in my heart, he was the winner. You don't have to chase the mechanical rabbit just because the other dogs are chasing it, stop, take a look, it could be your escape from Limbo. So the rest of today think of the day in a new approach and know that my arms are around you all, thank you.

Director 

01:42:10
MICK JACKSON There are things in her mind are very… very literal like. When someone says to her 'Temple is a miracle.' She suddenly has a flash of Christ walking on the water. It's only a moment but we don't see when she sees it. (inaudible) really captured that quote. 

01:42:25
CLAIRE DANES I was so privileged to have a chance to work with so many brilliant actors.

TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible). 

01:42:40
CLAIRE DANES She ended up working in the cattle industry, creating systems for cattle to move calmly. Temple realized there was a more humane way to encourage cattle. 

01:42:50
MICK JACKSON One of the great things about making this movie was that we worked from her plans and we… we've reconstructed one of her great achievements. 

01:42:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Hey, it's a real scene the (inaudible) fact that I designed recreated here absolute perfectly. 

01:43:05
SUSAN JACKSON 

01:43:05
Representative 

01:43:05
American Humane 

01:43:05
SUSAN JACKSON The cattle that we used to train cattle and it will look very intense on film, however when the viewers look very closely, they'll notice most of the commotion was just manmade. They had two Steffi cows as we call them in the film business and animatronic cow. These animals are used in place of a live real cow to depict some of the action. 

01:43:25
MICK JACKSON One of the things when… when Temple got interested in… in animals was to try and see how a cow would see, in that way she was able to think herself into the mind of a cow, which you sees the world very visually. And she saw you could make something that would fall a cow walking down a ramp (inaudible) so the cow walked peacefully and then found itself stepping off into the water. She knew cows like to walk in curved corners because they thought they were going back some where they'd been before. It was amazing that she could have visualized that whole thing. 

01:43:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN See the thing is a normal mind drops out the details, but the autism mind sees all the details. That's more like the animal mind, those animals are sensory thinkers, they think in pictures, they think it smells, they think in sounds. I know my system will work because I've been through it a thousand times of my head. 

01:44:15
MICK JACKSON (inaudible) ethos was I love animals so much I want every moment of their lives will be calm and what we've done in the movie is convey how she was able to see that in her head before she constructed it. 

01:44:25
JULIA ORMOND I think the main theme of the film is to follow your gut instinct. There is a tremendous lesson learned out of Temple's journey that we can help unlock a door for somebody's you appear as very locked. 

01:44:40
MICK JACKSON Nobody had said this is how it feels. Temple Grandin was the first person to actually describe what it was like to be autistic.

01:44:50
CLAIRE DANES She's a real authority and she's written many books on autism and animal behavior and she's a real success by… by anyone's standards. 

01:45:00

01:45:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, it's good to be here today. Unfortunately the handout will not match the slides because I got the wrong slides in here, but we'll just have to do it with the wrong slides. And I will just start out and talk a little bit about things helped me where I heard from mother. And one thing is mother had a real good instinct on just how much to stretch me, just how much to push me. See, I'm seeing too many kids today that aren't learning basic skills. She the thing about autism is… (inaudible) we totally at the wrong presentation completely. Umm… The problem you've got with autism is that its… When the kids are little… little kids, you know, I'm not talking the severe ones and the high-functioning one all look the same. Then you work really… really hard on the intervention, you know, the ABA and stuff in a very… very young and they kinda go into two groups. One that becomes fully verbal, maybe moderately verbal and then some that… that don't. And… and the problem is then you have got the Asperger type of kids where there are… there's no speech to (inaudible) the kind of you geeks nerds and I'm really get concerned about some of these kids, they're getting too coddled. I'm seeing too many kids come up to me at a convention and mom does all the talking. And one of the things being a child at 50 (inaudible) learned table manners. Now let me tell you something that happened at a banquet last night (inaudible) a banquet, you know, there's a little boy there's 12 years old and his, you know, they brought in special food for him to eat at a formal banquet, fried chicken from a certain restaurant and I'm going you gotta be kidding. That wouldn't have been allowed to eat what will serve only had formal Sunday dinner at grannies. And then mom cut the chicken for him and then he started to pick up the chicken up, it's not fully verbal kid and I said 'This is a formal dinner, use the utensils.' And, you know, what he did… he did. You see and he found out he could do it. And then there was another little girl there that was getting too overprotective probably about eight. I got her up with the microphone and I had to talk to the entire group and then was like, you know, 800 people there. She found out she could. You seek, this is stretching. See, went I was on a 15, I had a chance to go to my aunt's ranch. And my mother said I could go for a week or I could go for summer. You know, I had a choice there. You need to have some choices. But I was not going to become a recluse in my (inaudible). I'm seeing way too many recluses in the (inaudible). We got to get these kids out with jobs. Let's talk about teaching work skills. Like I'm getting ready to totally revamp the presentation. I don't know what happened with the slides (inaudible) completely wrong presentation and here we're going to have to just, you know, kind of work around that. Umm… I got in late last night and then have, you know, usually it's the right one. And… and let's start out teaching work skills. Okay, chores with little kids, but it needs to be something that benefits the whole family, like taking up the trash, clearing the table, even the little kids, six-year-olds can clear the table, dishes and things that benefit the whole family, not just, you know, clean up your room, and these are things that are expected. And then around 12, we need to start the work skills and I wish there was a paper route still around. So we got to find things outside the home to take the place of a paper route, like walking dogs for the next door neighbors, you know, would be one, working in the farmer's market, you know, fixing computers for little local business, so you set it up the florist shop. When I was 13, mother set me up a great little job where I hand the dresses for freelance seamstress. When I was 14 and 15, I was cleaning horse stalls. I ran a horse barn when I was 14 and 15 years old. And then I was painting signs and (inaudible). Even when I was getting my… my… Then when I was in college, I was going out to my aunt's ranch every summer, but then mother realizes we got to start doing something else, so we're going to do go in to the ranch for half the summer and then internship at a research lab for the other half of the summer, where I had to rent my own house with another lady. You see, you're always stretching. See the other thing is this is a gradual transition. It's not something sudden, but the problem we've got now in autism is I'm seeing too many of these high-end kids and they're going absolutely nowhere. Then I turn around and go to the meat packing plant and there's the old hippie that runs the maintenance shop. I know another guy in the cattle industry dyslexic, ADHD, probably Asperger's, horrendous speech in (inaudible) and he took welding in high school and now he owns a gigantic metal fabrication business, this is a kid they thought would go nowhere. You see, when I go over into my other world. I'm seeing these high-end kids (inaudible) straight out trailer part and they're doing better. And these are the ones where you don't have a… a speech delay. We've gotta get a lot more into what are the outcomes and I'm beginning to realize now how much working in the construction industries affected me. Because you build banks, I design something like half the cattle in this country are handling equipment I design. You design stuff it's all about outcomes. You build the project, you finish that project and you make it work. Well, (inaudible) the outcome is getting mechanical job. But the probably we got in autism is on the other half of the spectrum, you got very severe kids. They're not gonna get jobs, lot of (inaudible) them cannot do normal activities, this is the problem now we go with autism especially with DMS-5. We got this quagmire that's gone from somebody who gonna work at Silicon Valley to somebody that maybe especially retail would be good. I'm seeing some very good results with specialty retail, hardware stores, lumberyard, sporting goods stores, and how about selling cars. I just heard about a guy loves Subaru. He knows everything about Subaru. He went to work at a car dealership and he sold five cars the first week. You see that specialty retail. I just heard about a guy this morning works for Lowes. He knows everything about the My Lowes Card. He knows every product in the whole store, you seek, that using the autistic ability. And we need to figure out how to grease these kids and get them into these jobs working networks, bypass all the electronic bull crap you gotta do (inaudible) guys gonna short-circuit all that stuff. The other thing that I did is I learned how to sell my work by showing off my portfolio. But on the other hand, we've got the very… very severe kids and they're not gonna be doing these things. But the problem is it all has the same label. Now the thing about things like autism, its… it's a continuum, you see, a little bit autism gives an advantage like a brilliant computer (inaudible) an artist. And well, what happened to Little Albert today with no speech until age three. How about Little Stevie, he was a weird loner who brought snakes to school. And then there's a brand new book out about Beethoven and he probably was on the spectrum. Well, you've got schools that they take it out the hands-on classes. How are you going to get interested in music if you're not exposed to it? Music makes me really sad when I go into a school and this was the within the last year, they raised $400,000 for new tract and then the band that's totally wrong. I've seen too many kids on spectrum doing really well on things like band and wire, things that are musical things. People ask me all the time even in a regular universities, how they get interested in my passion and (inaudible) it gets down to being exposed to the (inaudible). You only get interested in things you get exposed to. If I hadn't gone to my aunt's ranch I would not have go into cattle industry, it's that simple. You've got to expose kids to a wide variety of things to find out what they might be interested in. Uh… The autism diagnosis also is not precise. This is not like a diagnosis of tuberculosis or Ebola. You got Ebola or you don't. You know, that is a definitive diagnosis, autism is not. Well, when we look through the history of the diagnosis, it's pretty shocking how it's changed over the years. You know, nobody's changing a diagnosis with tuberculosis. These diagnostic categories are half based on science and half based on squabbles around those conference room table, you know, there are little board rooms the hotel have with the leather chairs like a nice Hyatt or Marriott something like that, you know, no (inaudible) here. And they get doctors they sit around (inaudible) conference rooms and they argue over the stuff, that's not, as a scientist I have problems with them. While these to blame mothers for it, you know, then in 68 they were mixing up autism with schizophrenia and then they added the onset at (inaudible) this actually made some sense. In other words to be autistic, you had to have speech delay and symptoms before 30 months and that was the early onset disorder. You know, then they added in the Asperger's in the early 90s. Now you could be on the autism spectrum with no speech delay. Now we have the 2013 mess and I think what the doctors had planned on is now all the… all the Asperger types shunted over to Social Communication Disorder but that's not what happened. What's you've ended up having the big quagmire now a great big mess. Now the International Classification for Diseases, let's say international guideline ICD, they are proposing that still a proposal at this point four classifications. The Asperger name has gone. Because they don't wanna conflict too much with the (inaudible). Well, I'll tell you what they replaced it with. No speech delay, no intellectual impairment. And then you have at the bottom of the four categories intellectual impairment and speech delay, and then you've got intermediate categories. You've got four categories, from a service provider standpoint that actually makes some sense, makes a whole lot of sense. I hope it becomes a (inaudible). Now genetics complicate and there's no simple genetics here. It's a whole lot of little tiny snip changes. I think I'm going to skip through some genetic stuff but it's complicated quagmire. And I think the way they look at somebody's personality things it's like a music mixing board. One is geeks and nerds become a small amount of autism. You see, there's no black and white dividing line, a little bit of bipolar your creative. You get totally manic, you're fried circuit board is up here and if you know anybody this bipolar and you finally get them on meds and the right message and a lovely unstable, I just talked to one yesterday I said don't ever let your… let your prescription right out, don't ever. Like as we go into a psychotic manic phase uh… you're going to fry circuit boards and the meds… the meds may not work anymore. But these are continuous traits, we're in a little bit of the trait, it's an advantage, too much of trait, you've got a horrendous… horrendous disadvantage. Now I'm a visual thinker that's been an asset in my work designing livestock handling facilities. Now when I was younger, I used to think everybody find pictures the same I thought. Well, that's not the case. Everybody doesn't think in… in pictures, but the thing that seems to be the same is good at one thing, bad at something else, uneven skills and an education is too much emphasis on deficits and not enough emphasis on what the kid's good at. And I'm realizing now just how much 20 years working in the construction trades, supervising building things that I had designed influences how I think. Because in construction that's all about outcomes and playing video games on Social Security is not a satisfactory outcome. And I am seeing that way too often. And I am talking about a fully verbal people here. I'm not talking about the more severe one, maybe partially verbal, I'm not talking about that. And we've got to get into good outcome. Okay, working at Lowes and knowing everything there is about the Lowes card and every product in the store, that's a good job. You see, that's using an autistic strength which is able to memorize lots of details because the autistic minds in the detail. I think we need to be looking a lot more specialized retail shops. (inaudible) it could be computers, it could be (inaudible). Okay, I just met a little kids you got really bad sensory problems, how about a nice quiet AT & T Store and you're going to know everything about every kind of phone and you're gonna be appreciated for that because you're super knowledgeable of every kind of phone, when a new phone comes out, they know everything about it, no store is a quiet. So that would be a good environment. You know, we've got to work around some of the sensory issues. Again that's construction and sometimes you gotta do some things that, yeah, maybe are not supposed to do like block a road with a cement mixer. Yeah, (inaudible) so once you get to do things like that and if the cops come around, you have to say 'Oh, you got to help me direct the traffic,' you know, that's what you do with the cops, you know, a construction man you gotta get stuff done and we gotta get much more of an attitude how do we… how do we figure out a way to have a good outcome because I'm seeing too many (inaudible) coddled and one of the things that helped me and has helped a lot of, you know, the fully verbal Asperger types was the old fashion 50s upbringing, gotta learn table manners, say please and thank you. Now another thing is when a social mistake is made, you give the instruction like 'I didn't say to this kids stop it, when he picked the chicken up to eat it with his fingers.' I said use the utensils, this is a formal banquet, this is a formal dinner, you cannot eat with your hands at a formal dinner. I gave the instruction and he ate all of the food that should not have been brought in with the utensils. Dad was gone like this and no, but you're not doing that kid a favor. Now he's joke around that I had huge internet access line in my head for visual thinking turns out that I do, big internet circuit. Now here's all my drawings. Now when you're a weird geek, the way I sold myself was showing off drawings. I got a reputation to writing accurate articles for the Farm & Ranch Magazine that start out one little article at a time and I just talked to a young man who has got Aspergers who works the local paper, 'good,' you know, and he does sports okay, and again that's something that specialized. You know, get you're worked on your phone, so you can show it off if… if it's an art person, show off your work. There's a boy named (inaudible) doing beautiful art, I recommended his mom that he should go to professional art shows. He's been getting up doing things, let me tell you it's a new Grant. He's gotten so much more social because he had to get out and do it and when I was a young kid one thing that mother had me do was be little party hostess, you know, maybe seven years old, you're kid (inaudible) me little party hosts and you've gotta greet the guests, serve the snacks that obviously I did not serve alcohol, it was (inaudible), but I served snacks and I… I (inaudible) have to greet the guests. Now this shows what happened to my math department, you know, the blue parts kinda full of water that kind of trashed out math and, you know, one thing my mother did was build up on my art ability and the thing is we need to have the art people. When you look at your iPhone that interface was not made by an engineer, it was made by an artist. Every single smart phone that's made… That Interface is made by an artist. Then engineers had to figure out how to make it work. That's the mathematicians, you see, that's the different kinds of minds working together. And when I go out to Silicon Valley and I've been there Disney Imagineering Pixar, all those kinds of places like that, tons of Aspee's all over the place. And also one geek is going to really cool stuff like that and another geek is getting addicted to video games. And some people gonna think I'm an old fogy on that but I'm not seeing good outcomes. It's one hour a day of video games, we don't (inaudible) no forbidden fruiter, but it's got to be limited. It's got to be severely limited, one hour a day. When I was a little kid, it was one hour day of television during the week and two hours a day of television allowed on the weekends that was a rule, and if I had temper tantrum, either at home or at school TV was taken away for one night that was a rule. Now they will always argue about innate ability where I think it matters the most whereas in the stream ability and something like math art or extreme disability. And when I was in college in 1968, Bill Gates and I both had access to this state-of-the-art IBM teletype, the (inaudible) punch cards. You know why boarding passes are the size that they are? It the evolutionary remnant of the IBM punch card, so when you get those stiff airline boarding passes. Well, when I did my master's thesis, I had about 3,000 of those, 3,000 boarding passes with holes punched in them for each one of the cattle in my research. It really blows my students minds. Mechanical spreadsheet has sort the boarding passes in the spreadsheet into actual slots. Well, this thing you can bypass that. And I wanted to program a computer but I couldn't do it. I had access to the class, I had plenty of instruction but I just couldn't do it. This is a really important slide and the slide is same in both presentations, it's probably the single most important slide. I am a photo-realistic visual thinker and object visualize, I can't do algebra. If the kid can't do algebra, let's go on to geometry and trig or what do we do about school requirements, we got to figure out how to do a construction industry illegal but not bad to get out of that and if your stuff's good enough, they won't care if not do algebra or not. And the other place there's a good place for a lot of my kinds of minds as skilled traits. We have a huge shortage in this country right now automobile mechanics and diesel mechanics, and they're teaching those classes at the community college, you need to be exposing a kid in middle school that engines are cool, so that's one you need to get them hooked on that. Oil industry is going crazy because they can't get enough certified welders, utilities can't get enough people to fix the big power lines. These are jobs that only require sixth grade math and anything that needs algebra is more complicated either going to be on a chart or a table in a book or it's going to be a computer program, that's a reality out there in the real world of fixing these things been (inaudible) done a lot of those things. And then you've got the mathematician mind, as these are your programmers, your engineers. And sometimes engineers over calculate. I had an interesting talk with Karen Watson from Texas A & M University she's the provost and she says kids today they can't just estimate. All right, they'll give you a little ethics question the engineering. You work for the Boeing Airplane Factory, you're the manager of it, of Boeing Airplane and somebody drops a really heavy tool on the wing of a partially built airplane. They go in and check out the metal, they find out that it's been a little bit fatigued, but it still within the critical barely within the critical safety limit, what do you do? Well, 10, 15 years ago, 90% would say 'You throw away that part, you don't use it.' Now only 60% say that. Well, I think that's real worry I didn't ask you, would you want to fly it? I didn't ask you that, what would you do? Then the correct answer is the part is thrown away, the part that's fatigue, you throw it out, you don't use it. I was very happy I got it right. And then you have the verbal facts guy, these are the guys are like social studies and things like that, some of these would be really good in specialty retail. And there's evidence for these different types of visualization actually do exist, I mean, we're all into evidence-based. Well, it really does exist in the autistic brain book it's got the scientific references the (inaudible) if exist. And there's two ways to do the math, you can do with the algebra line or you can do with the more pattern thinking way. And some of these kids can do without showing their work. They don't think the same way. Well, you take some precautious against cheating, let him do it done, let's do it their way. Now I want to give you a glimpse into a mind that is not my mind, this is the pattern thinker, thinks in patterns rather than pictures. This praying mantis is made out of a single sheet of folded paper, no cutting, no tape and in the background is the folding pattern, it's not my mind. There is some great little stars that some kids gave me. I always like to show drawings off because you've got to learn how to sell your portfolio. All have kids come in and they say they're really good at art and I said you have it on your phone? No, it's not on your phone, it's on your parent's phone? You never know where you're going to find the person that you can show that too and it will open a door that is something I learned very early on. And in the movie there's a lot of cowboys being nasty to me, but you know what there was good feed yard managers. There was some good building contractors that recognized my abilities and there's a scene in the movie where my boss slams down the deodorant says 'You stink, use it,' that happened, that's real. The scene where the secretary took me shopping, that's real and at the time I was furious, but when I look back I thank that boss. It's okay to be eccentric, but you can't be a rude, filthy, dirty (inaudible) it's okay, rude and filthy and dirty is not okay. Now here's a beautiful bridge that Jesse Parks drew she's kind of more in the moderate level, well, they had to work with her because before she did beautiful bridges the people will pay money for, she'd get electric blanket controls. You'll see you have got to get something other people might actually want and here's (inaudible) art Eco artist. This is the guy I was telling you about. The once he got out and started doing professional shows, he's like a new Grant. He's like so much more social now. He sewed on some $2,000 and $3,000 pieces now. You see ability has to be developed, now not everybody can be Grant, but there's a lot of people that would be very good at various specialized retail jobs. And if they got sensory problems, well, find a quiet, you know, there's a lot of stores that are not noisy and chaotic, you know, like Walmart that probably not be the best place to be. Well, the thing is the world needs us visual thinkers, which it remains of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. This is a mess you don't want to get near and still a gigantic mess. And they made a visual thinking mistake that the mathematicians didn't see and if I had been drawing the concrete work for us plant, I would have been sitting there and going wait a minute we're next to the sea and we have all our emergency equipment, our emergency pump for cooling, our generators and everything to run that in a non waterproof basement. So the reason why this blew up is because the basement flooded with all their emergency back-up equipment in it. I'm going how could you make this mistake. I can't design a nuclear reactor, but boy, I would have been on the phone this was (inaudible) on the phone shipbuilding companies to get some crank them shuts submarine doors and if they had had that it would… it would still be there, it wouldn't happened. I'm going how could you do that? Well, my work with animals, I noticed animals notice visual detail. They notice sensory detail, like this flag is here waving scaring the cattle. Animals see detail, now when you're trying to work out problems with some of these kids that can't talk, you've got to figure out does he have a hidden painful medical problem, is it biology or is it behavior. And you got a kid who can't talk and all of a sudden, he's got really awful behavior, you want to check out, tummy ache from acid reflux as real common, earache ear infections, sinus infection, tooth infection, urinary tract infection, yeast infection, you got to rule out the stuff, they can't tell you about. All right, how many people saw it that animal was looking at that… at that Sunbeam? No, I'm not doing very good. How do we… How many people on the Boeing question voted don't be truthful now that… that part in that airplane needed to be thrown away? All right that's doing pretty good, not as good as I would like. You see and she deliberately asked that what would you do and I immediately said 'You don't use it, ' whenever… whatever parts fatigued you don't use. Doesn't… Somebody else I will throw away the whole airplane, well, that you wouldn't have to do. But the part that had any sign of any… any metal fatigue, you'd have to get rid of. Animals' world sensor-based, now you're working (inaudible) that's nonverbal and (inaudible) now living in a word world. He may have disordered sensory or maybe his visual system is pixelating like a bad television. You know, what a bad television you got a big flat-screen TV, there's a lot of rapid motion on it and you got a really bad signal went it's raining and you see the little squares in the picture. Well, imagine if your sight was like that, well, there's some kids out when they get tired that gets worse. Imagine you're hearing fading out like a really awful mobile phone, you know, you're driving along and a phone is cutting in and out as you're going up and down the hills. When I was a young child, I couldn't hear hard consonant sounds so my speech teacher would slowdown (inaudible) and she'd say cup and then she'd say 'Cupa' and she alternate back and forth (inaudible) quickly and saying it slowly and the other big thing that was emphasizes turn-taking, we have got to teach these kids to take turns. I want to repeat that again, I want you to write it down. We have got a teach these kids how to take turns and that was taught with Parcheesi Board. There's an old-fashioned board game, you've got to wait and take your turn and then, you know, the family maybe does activities. Well, maybe… maybe every Saturday they go out and they do something like miniature golf or maybe they do skateboarding. There's three kids, well, then the autistic kid only gets to choose every third week, that's taking terms, okay, maybe the autistic kid hates skateboarding when he's gonna have to watch it then, you know, because you've got to take turns. You don't get to do miniature golf every weekend that your brother hates, you know, that's just where you've got the turn taking stuff. Now there's evidence that language covers up on visual thinking some of the other things in certain type of Alzheimer's, as a language parts of the brain get wrecked art can come out, when Van Gogh was making Starry Night, I don't think he realized he was doing mathematics in it. I think you realize that, I don't know what's going on with the computer now. Okay, something's going on here with a computer wait a minute. I hit the… Okay, now maybe that will work the (inaudible) started get to unplug. Okay, this is a really important slide. My thinking is bottom-up, this is a very important concept. Normal thinking is top-down, in other words you make the concept, you put the details into it. Autistic thinking is bottom-up, in other words concepts are formed with specific examples. This is why it's so important to get these kids out, see on lots and lots of different things, so they have lots of more specific pictures to put in our memory. Because to understand something in the future, I've got to compare it back to something in the past. You want to teach a concept like up and down, you must use lots of different specific examples like I went up the hill, I climb up the stairs, applying what up in the air, I throw a ball up in the air, you've got to use those specific examples, and I know that slide is somewhere on your handout. You've got to teach with many different specific examples that's why it's so important to get these kids out seeing a lot of stuff because imagine that you got a good Google Search Engine, but you got to fill their mind up with lots of web pages that they can search. Well, after the playing video games all day at home they're not getting (inaudible) web pages that are useful web pages. My thinking also was associative, it's not linear. So if I see the United Airlines Terminal in Chicago for example, okay, I can start searching my database for glass structure category or search my database for an airport category and the pictures are specific. If I asked you about a church steeple, I was shocked to find out from speech therapists that they only see this vague generalized thing. I don't have a vague generalized thing. I see specific ones. Okay glass structure, the Biosphere in Arizona, the Crystal Palace at the Old World's Fair, our greenhouse at Colorado State, (inaudible) the Denver airport, the Dallas Airport, airports are specific, airport category is formed by putting pictures of specific airports into the airport category and then I can make subcategories like hub airports, super expensive airports like Huntsville, Alabama and yeah, little tiny Barbie jets going there and they charge (inaudible). You know, you can make different categories. (inaudible) private airports, hub airports, you know, then I can start putting airports into different… I can categorize. But as I categorize them I see pictures. Okay, Minneapolis, Atlanta and that's a real joke when it snows. Yep, I was there for that funsie onesies and the Governor of Georgia was telling all the truckers to stay out of Georgia and they had two inches of snow, oh, if they salted the roads before the storm wouldn't happened. And then you got… and then you got the airport in New York is not very nice. (inaudible). They really need to do something about LaGuardia. Okay, now when I asked an astrophysicist about the church staples, he didn't see pictures, he saw a motion of people singing and praying, he saw patterns, you see that's the mathematician mind and I think that guy was on the spectrum. Now animals will form categories. On the horse safe, people on the ground knowing scaring. You see it's specific, it's really specific or you might have a child that screams when it goes in this room and you can't tell why he's screaming. He's screaming because he saw the red fire alarm box and he's afraid that it might go off. You see, this is the fear of (inaudible) he sees that thing that's associated with bad things. Now we're troubleshooting something, I find this is true whether it's construction or whether it's education, categorizing problems. Okay, is it Biology or behavior? People are very bad about categorizing problems. They also grossly oversimplify, grossly over-generalize, they'll say what do you do about behavior problems in the classroom. Well, I don't know how old is this kid, what did he do, can he talk, I gotta have a lot more information, but I get asked these overgeneralized questions all the time, and this is really bad, the autism label. Because it's such a broad spectrum now, it's such a broad spectrum and it's sort of like two different conditions put in the same label, it's really turned into a mass, the standpoint of doing services but you (inaudible) troubleshoot things you've got to ask more specific questions. And here's the team that put the Mars Rover on Mars. Let me tell you, lots and lots of Asperger types here and you see the guy with gray hair, you know, how he got that job, he was a theatre major, he started out as a theater major and then he switched over into physics. He's the navigator to get the Mars Rover rocket to go to Mars, theatre major originally. Well, what would happen if we hadn't that theatre, you know, this is why I get so worried about taken all these things out of the schools, let's look at (inaudible), the head of the, you know, Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise Next Generation. When he was 12, he came from a very troubled background. He was in the school play and they discovered that he wanted to do acting. What if they'd been no school play, where would he have gone? Now I was more interested in looking at pictures of things than looking at pictures of people, but we need to have people interested in things, you see, again I think that's sort of a continuum. A brain can be more thinking or brain can be more cognitive. You know, at what point does something become an abnormality. This is where you gotta stretch these kids. I love this terms stretching, and mother had a really good instincts on how much to stretch. And I'm seeing too many kids overprotected I go to these conferences and the mom walks up with a kid, the kid is like clinging (inaudible) and… and mom asks to get the book signed, well, the kid should go up mother would have made me go up and do it. You know, you got to… you got to stretch. Now again, no sudden surprises, sudden surprises cause panic, no sudden surprise that's not the thing to do. But if you don't stretch, they don't develop and the thing that really bothers me, when I go back and forth in the autism world and the wild stock world (inaudible) I'm saying a lot of people my generation that I know are on the spectrum that got and kept decent employment their whole entire life and I got a book out there called 'Different Not Less' and one of the reason why I did that book it's 14 old Asperger's they got diagnosed later in life because their relationships were a mess and that's where the diagnosis was helpful. The diagnosis was helpful for the srelationship stuff, it's not that helpful for the employment stuff and for some of the other stuff and that's where they got great insight and the jobs that these people kept all their lives (inaudible) we had 28 people write in entries and they had to like write their story on kind of a format thing and then we had two of (inaudible) so security that was discarded that, you know, they had to have worked all their life and the jobs that they work in range from low-level tour guide, an attendant at, you know, with psychiatric patients to a real high level computer jobs. I did not fill it up with computer geeks. I was really careful to have a variety of different jobs, but you know what they all had jobs as teenagers and they had to work really hard… they had to work really… really hard. Mentors, I had a great science teacher, he showed me a lot of interesting stuff like optical illusion (inaudible). Let's look into all the retirees that are around, you know, maybe and get somebody to come and work with middle scholars on fixing small engines. What's the price of old lawnmowers they're free. You're worried about safety, you can take blades off, but you know get some of these kids interested in fixing engines. Uh… You'll get all sorts of things, you get to show kids interesting stuff to get them interested… interesting stuff. You know, and we're finally learning that free plays important, you know, even the normal kids they don't know how to negotiate, they don't know how to problem solve and that might be one of the reasons why only 60% of the engineering major say replace the part on the airplane, that's changed over the years, that's kinda scary. You see when somebody is thinking about it too abstractly, my… I said you don't use it. (inaudible) that was the right, you don't throw the whole airplane like with the parts that are damaged you don't use. My ability in art was always encouraged build on strengths, if you got a third greater than do high-end math let him have college math books, you know, (inaudible) the third grade classroom, you know, let them go ahead and advance with those college math books. He's gonna need some special at reading that's sort of how the pattern goes. We got to start thinking a lot more about what's going to happen at the end point and we're getting way too many high-end kids recluses (inaudible). And when I wanted (inaudible) getting kicked out of high school for fighting, a big high school did not work for me. I was one of the kids had to be taken out, so if you're home school (inaudible) online gotta get a job, gotta get his butt out of the ass just that simple. And socializing with high school kids is not a skill I need. But one of the things that really helped me was I got social interaction through the shared interests, horseback riding, model rockets, and electronics. And the kids that were interested in these things were not the kids that were doing they… they teasing and bullying and all of that kind of stuff, they were not the ones that were doing it. You gotta get him into the specialized things. There's great online resources out there. Khan Academy, you can learn JavaScript programming on that, it's all free. Udacity is a programming umm… programming classes I think they're starting to make you pay for those now, Coursera, more college classes online that are free, there's great stuff online. You see, and there's so many great tools out there on the internet. (inaudible) Linkedin network (inaudible) worked freelance graphic design. I write books there's all kinds of self-publishing tools. We got to start getting a lot more resourceful about getting that end result, which is getting a kid out to decent jobs, stay out of trouble with the law and living independently doing something he likes doing, that's the end result, that's construction and it's only been in the last year how much I've realized, how much the construction industry is effected how I think it's all about outcomes and when I worked on animal welfare in the meat industry, I came up with a simple scoring system I call the traffic rules for meat plants. If more three cattle (inaudible) and move when you're handling, you fail the McDonald's on it, it's that simple. And when we first started out we'd have vocalization scores of 35%,15% that's like horrible, you know, you drop gates on cattle and shock them (inaudible) they gonna move, but you see what you're doing is you're measuring outcome, it's about outcome. And here's one of my designs and sketch up, a free program you can get online. It's a great thing and then you can printed on a 3D printer. You see, as I like taking the online world and connecting it back to the real world and a 3D printer is a fiddly little machine squirts out liquid plastic goo and it will print your thing, even a little gates are gonna swing on it and it requires patients when you want to make a website, they say warning, patients require. And then the school says we can't afford a price of a 3D printer. I go 'Wait a minute, is the price of one major league football uniform.' And I've gone into schools where they had a waiting room that the NFL look like, so they spend money on that, well, then we'll spend $3,000 on a 3D printer and get, you know, some people, you know, teach that to the kids something that's a career relevant skill. Okay, you got a kid that's addicted to Minecraft. Let me tell you what one enterprising mom did? She wanted a lumberyard, she got some two-by-four four cut up, then she had the kids sanded and paint the blocks, and now they had Minecraft blocks, they play within the driveway. That made her kid to hit the neighborhood. You see and that's getting an online thing back to the real world because I think we need to work hands on to do good problem solving. Because if you design your thing wrong on sketch up, when you print it, it'll just fall apart when you're print it, you know, it's not quite so simple in the real world, but 3D printer is a real-world. It's a little mechanical device and it goes around like this and squirts plastic goo out. You know, there's all a lot of great scientific projects online. All right, when I was in high school, I wasn't doing very much studying, (inaudible) working skills and one of the things they used to call me was workforce and here's our ski tell house before and after. Yeah, (inaudible) citing, white tram Yes, I was learning some working skills and I didn't decorate it with flying saucers that would not be appreciating. Starship Enterprise is not what they would've wanted. My science teacher really motivated me. I can't emphasize enough the importance of mentors just so… so… so important. I'm very concerned that our educational system, you know, is gonna kinda screen out especially the visual thinkers like me, but you need me because you don't have Fukushima Disasters. Also you need me at the Boeing Plant because as visual thinkers they're gonna go 'No, we don't use those broken that part that's been fatigued, throw it away. And somebody else said 'Throw away whole airplane.' No, you don't throw away the whole airplane. Only the parts that were the tool chester whatever was fell on it. You see, I'm seeing it, you throw those parts away, not the entire airplane. And what I thought was very interesting what Karen Watson had to say to me that lot of today's students they have the really high math SATs cannot estimate things. You know, they'll get in there and they'll calculate that mental fatigue down, calculate it… calculate it… calculate it… calculate it and try to figure out, you know, maybe they justify keeping it, now you throw it out. Okay, taken hands-on classes out of the schools are worse things I ever did, you know, fancy cooking is a good career for a lot of these kids. You know, sewing, you know, of course girls in the 50s learn sewing, my favorite toy when I was in fourth grade it was my real little toy sewing machine that I crank that and I sewed and I made things with it. And the thing about making things is sometimes your projects don't come out right. I would experiment for hours with little airplanes and kites that flew behind my trike and how the airliner has this little wing tips, I made a kite that had the same wing ratio to wingtip ratios as commercial airliner, I was seven. And I think (inaudible) really interesting go back duplicate some of those kites and they were just made out of art paper and on thread and I… I stiffened the wings with half-inch adhesive tape that's the thing where I can't remember exactly how I did it. But you see doing hands-on things teaches resourcefulness. Maybe your project doesn't always come out right, then you gotta fix your project, you've got to figure it out. I remember when we were kids, we had a sleep out in the backyard and we had and one of the neighbors had this old army tent that we didn't put up right, it was sagging, did the grown-ups help us, no. We had to sleep out in the sagging tent. Then we had to get together and decide what we're going to buy for snack foods so we pooled our allowances to get all us grape soda that we spilled all over every time… Yeah, but that's learning that negotiation and one of the kids in the neighborhoods really bossy and usually got why that wasn't all bad for me. Here's the stop that saved me carpentry work, riding horses, all these hands on stuff. We need people in this country they can just get out there and do real stuff. We're shortage of mechanics and one of the things I got to make sure I'm seeing too many talented quirky kids go nowhere, they are getting labels and going nowhere. See this is the problem we've got with autism as we've got these two big groups now. We got the real high-end Asperger type or if you use the ICD proposed classification, umm… no… speech impaired… no speech impairment, no intellectual impairment and on the other end you've got kids that have got very severe problems that need very different kinds of services. Finding the normal mind is a really hard time differentiating aiding those out. See I kinda see specific examples of the different kinds of cats and I'm just saying kids, you know, people my age working in construction that I know are on the spectrum, I can think of weird welders I've worked with, weird sign painter I've worked with, uh… metal fabrication people that I've worked with, umm… there's an old (inaudible) that runs the maintenance shop at one of the major plants, he's still there. He's been there through three plant owners, does he socialize with people in the plant? No, he hired a whole bunch more Aspee's and they have a picnic table out in the shop and that's where they eat, they don't eat in the cafeteria. You don't socialize with suits, suits are bad, you know, (inaudible) all techies versus the suit things and those guys have jobs. Okay, what are some of the keys to employment, you sell your work rather than yourself, this is where you get into portfolios, where you put your artwork out there. I'd have a portfolio and I pull out one of my big drawings because this was all pre-Internet and they go 'Wow! You did that?' I'd show photographs of jobs that's selling a work. And when I was at the Farm & Ranch, the very nice graphics lady there Jackie, I think she probably was on the spectrum too. And we got a new boss and Jim the new boss didn't like me because I was too weird and I didn't see the warning signs and Jackie says to me 'Jim doesn't like you, we're going to have to get a scrapbook together all your work.' So I put all my articles in one big scrapbook and Jim gave me a race that was an example saving my job, but I didn't see those warning signs. Also, you know, one thing good about working for a magazine is they had very specific outcomes, a certain amount of column inches (inaudible) on the 15th of the month, I had to cover a variety of different things, I was free to write features but then there was certain things I had to cover like the cattle growers meeting, the Arizona Cattle Feeders Meeting those were specific sale and show results which are boring, big long lists and boy if you leave out we left out the dairy cattle one time and they were not happy and we heard about it. They all are specific outcomes and when the mistakes made at work, the boss can't say something like 'Well, you're too aggressive with customers in the store, you gotta explain (inaudible) only approach a customer twice or you might say 'Watch how Susie works with customers,' you cannot be vague being too aggressive or not being a team player that's (inaudible) person with autism is not going to understand that. They need specific information just like I said that a little boy at the… at the, you know, formal dinner table when he picked chicken up with his hands I said 'Use the utensil.' I didn't say no. I told them exactly what to do. That's one thing we've got to get away from saying no, quit it, stop it, you gotta stop that. Okay, let's say I want to teach a kid to be museum tour guide. A lot of museums will take them as young as 12. You have to demonstrate the correct distance, demonstrate the correct greedy, you assess them like coaching characters in a play, that's how you teach the social skills. You know, going up in the 50s may and you had to say please and thank you, you know, that was required. You have to wait your term. You, you know, sit through dinners, things you had to do. And let's talk end up talking about sensory issues. Sensory issues can really be a big problem and they range from a nuisance, which for me just a nuisance now to being very debilitating, you can have sound sensitivity, you can have visual sensitivity where you can't stand fluorescent lights, touch sensitivity. I still can't stand on scratchy things against my skin. And sensory issues are co-morbid that's a stupid medical word for in conjunction with, that's all it means. You know, medicine is always ridiculous Latin terms for different parts of the brain. While if you look up the English definition that means stupid things, like this… these hippocampus that's the part involved with memory, that's the seahorse. The brain's fear center that's the (inaudible). Well, when (inaudible) a visual thinker as I went through my 20s, my anxiety got worse and… worse and… worse and… worse. It's now controlled of low dose of antidepressant medication. And the mistake that's made with drugs like Prozac and Zoloft is getting too high a dose. And then you get agitation and insomnia. Often all you need is one fourth to one-half the (inaudible) in my book 'Thinking in Pictures' I have a chapter called a Believer in Biochemistry, even the chapter is now 20 years old, the stuff on the medication there is still correct, that has not changed. And I know a lot of visual thinkers (inaudible) in the livestock industry that design things like meat plants and boiling (inaudible) meat plants to design on Prozac and kept the guys off drugs and alcohol too. You know, just a little bit of antidepressants saved me, cured my colitis. All right, let's get back to some sensory issues. Loud noises hurt my ears. Another problem was I had difficulty hearing hard consonant sounds. Now there's a new treatment out there now for sensory issues, it's called environmental enrichment is an effective treatment for autism… Environmental enrichment is an effective treatment for autism. There's also a new online Scientific American article on this environmental enrichment. And it uses a very simple principle, you stimulate two senses at the same time with a lot emphasis on the primitive senses which are smell, touch and balance. You see the higher senses are hearing and vision. So you might do smell vanilla aromatherapy, they used eight different aromatherapy, you can buy commercially and you might be touching rough carpeting or you might be smelling something else and they rub your back with hot and cold spoons. And it was deliberately designed to use household things that were not expensive, no expensive equipment require, but the principle is, you stimulate two senses at the same time and one of them is smell or touch usually and the other principle keep changing it, novelty… novelty that is the other principle, novelty. You always keep changing it. I think sometimes one of the reasons why some of the sensory integration things have not worked is because a kid comes into the… into the OT and he do the same thing all the time. You know, you gotta keep changing it. But the smell is one of the basic things and you keep changing the aroma therapists and you use pleasant smells, so that (inaudible) actually hates one of the smells you don't use it, but you have at least eight different aromatherapies and then you keep changing it or if can't afford aromatherapy, you can probably use things out of the spice cabinet. But it's a very simple (inaudible) nothing, it's not cure for autism, but when the children and some of them were older kids were evaluated by psychologists blind treatment, it's really important, this is a proper scientific study there were improvements. And I think that's really a very exciting thing, environmental enrichment is an effective treatment for autism that is the name of the paper now to search for it online, if you're using Google, you can use three key words, autism environmental enrichment. I'm going to say them again autism environmental enrichment. Okay, let's look at some brain stuff. Well, I'm definitely an auditory learner because that's a circuit for speak what I hear. And here's a normal speak what you see cable bundle, that's mine. I got a lot of extra branches there, maybe that's why when you give me keywords I see pictures because the speak what you see circuit spread all over the brain. In fact, where this right there you can see where the ends are cut-off. USA today's got a picture (inaudible) USA take some of the really coolest pictures and this goes all over the whole brain. Now at what point is an extra branch abnormal. There's no dividing line, this is developmental. Now the price I paid for that is I have less fiber, less bandwidths to put it in internet terms for speak what I say and I had trouble get my speech out. I couldn't get that speech out, my speech teacher kinda had to push me to get it out and then I had some auditory processing problem and not hearing the… the hard consonant sounds and when the grown-ups talked fast, it went into… Like that. Now another kind of kid is echolalia like, all of this great words are coming out movie scripts and TV commercials, but they don't know what it means and then they may start to associate the serial commercial with breakfast. So the singer serial commercial at breakfast, then give him the cereal. Okay, they're saying about Kellogg's or whatever, well, I'd go out and buy Kellogg's than when the kid says that I'm going to give him the cereal. Then you'll start to learn that the words have meaning and I think there's a book out right now about a child that's really in Disney Movies like Peter Pan and one day his brother says 'I don't want to grow up' and then an autistic kid had heard that the Peter Pan Movie I don't want to grow up, you see, now they're starting to see a relationship they have with the language. Another problems attention shifting slowness, it takes much longer to shift back and forth. You gotta give some of these kids time to process, takes a little longer for them to process. Because they got… they gotta search through their databases, it's bottom-up thinking. You see top-down thinking is quick, but it's not precise. Bottom-up thinking is precise, but you've got to search a lot of databases. And that doesn't usually take very long, but it might take two or three seconds. Now if a child has trouble with reading, ask him if they ever see the print jiggle is on the page. Now this does not explain all dyslexia, I want to make that very… very clear, but there is a subtype of dyslexia where this explains it. Now you go in and you do a journal article search 'Yeah, I find a paper that says that the treatment I'm going to tell you about doesn't work, but the problem is we're mixing up subgroups, but there's a subgroup. Where if the print jiggle is on the page, they hate fluorescent lights, the kids scared of escalators. Where something is simple as printing his book on tan, gray light blue, light green all the different pastel papers can, you know, say this academic career back I just talked to cattlemen that I've known for years and we were in the car and he was telling me he was dyslexic and I had a children's… there was a children's book in a car that had a lot of print in there with pale colored backgrounds and I hadn't read it. And he could read better on… on the purple background. So now he's… he's using purple paper in his printer and he said 'He fixed his dyslexia.' Now I want to emphasize this is not everybody, it's a subgroup, it not only be 10%. Well, you're talking about something so simple to try. Also experiment with like pale pink glasses, pale light blue glasses, I like to really emphasize things that are low income folks can do. I mean, this is something that costs just about nothing to try. And there's my (inaudible) and that's the connectome, this is all the white matter cable bundles that connect up different parts of the brain and this is where you have abnormalities in growth. What tends to happen is in the back of the brain, you got more local circuits, explains the more bottom-up thinking. I think the connectomes really pretty when you look at it by itself and you can see a little… little fiber there that's a single axon, that goes all the way across the brain. Other brain scan findings my amygdala or my fear center, was larger than normal. Now I want to emphasize not everybody has this problem, but I think as visual thinkers we tend to be the panic monsters. And then the kids that are more the word thinkers, they tend to be calmer. You see, this is where we got a lot of subgroups in autism. Now the one thing in autism there seems to be kinda universal is the social awkwardness, problems with the face recognition, and the research is showing on that is that circuits in the brain are used for face recognition are the ones normally used for identifying things, you know, so when I remember things I'll remember this person has big black glasses or they've got beard or they've got, you know, mohawk haircut, you know, Il remember some… something like that about. Okay, accommodations in the workplace? Yes, some are going to need a quiet place to work, they may need some breaks, no, sudden changes in work routine. We've got to make accommodations that enable. I'm seeing too many accommodations that enable handicap mentality. Umm… Well, I talked I had a girl in my class (inaudible) I want to take a test over in the testing center and I've… and when I talked to and I think she's got the problem with the vibrating writing and I said 'You take this form for permission to take your tests in the testing office and you take it down to FedEx Kinko's print shop. I want you to print this on every color paper that got down there and then you tell me about it next week because I think you're not gonna need that. I'll find out next week just try that. I find one of them every semester in my class that are helped by this one out of 50 or 60 students. Now it's not everybody, but you're talking about an intervention so simple. Wouldn't it be stupid not maybe $2 worth of papers all you need and I think the print shop would give you the paper, might even be free to try it? We're gonna start to figure out how do we enable, how do we make it work? Yes, uh… there's no way I could work in a busy office with my cube next to the bathrooms or next to the coffee maker that would not work. I've got to have a quiet place to work. Now let's figure out how do we make it work? And we got, you know, there are some accommodations you need to have, you know, we're not going to get scratchy skin uh… scratchy clothes against my skin. How do we make be successful? You know, now I think it's good they have all the individual, you know, education plans but its alternative big bureaucracy. You know, what's happened in just a little informal help here or there? Okay, it's okay for scientist to cry because in order to deal with my anger issues, I had to switch from anger to cry. You know, now when I got (inaudible) instead of fighting with fists, I cried. I was still just as miserable, NASA Space Scientist cried when they shut down the shuttle. It's the saddest thing to look it up on… on… on 60 Minutes. I've talked to NASA space scientist, who got grandkids with autism. Oh, you go to these tech centers all the ones especially the old tech companies, they're busting out all over with autistic kids. You see, they're putting that genetics together. (inaudible) and my mother likes to talk about, takes a village to raise a child. This is where people need to work together to figure it out, just like I learned at Texas A & M, the engineers can't estimate anymore. And their first reaction was not to throw away the airplane part, we got to figure out how to do things. And again it's really hard with autism being such a big spectrum because you have this other more severe spectrum. No, they're not gonna be able to do the things that I'm talking about. You know this and… You know, this is the problem and then when the kids are real little, the ones that can go real high functioning and the ones that we will not, look exactly the same when they're real… real well. And this is where the early interventions (inaudible) so important. And even with normal kids, I was reading some research about birth of the three programs where you've worked even with normal little infants especially in disadvantaged backgrounds. Maybe you work with the grandmothers in the community, come in and work with these babies. Yeah, when they get to be 40, they're 10% more likely to have a decent job. You know, the… the very early development is really important. Parents reading to kids is really… really important, you know, that they and talk to kids. Okay, let's say commercial comes on TV and well, let's talk about, well, maybe that, you know, they're saying is that the cereal is part of healthy breakfast or maybe it's not. You know, let's now discuss these… these things with kids and talk to kids about things, and the research is showing this is all really important and we gotta kind of just figure it out. Well, I think now we've got some time for some questions. And I always like questions. Okay. 

02:49:00
[sil.] 

02:49:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN The… what the question was what is the hardest part of being… what? A tycoon? Oh, you mean, what's the hardest part about being an entrepreneur in other words how do you get your business started? I got my freelance cattle business started one little tiny job at a time and it started out first of all with one little tiny farm ranchmen article at a time and then I designed a job and I wrote it up for Beef Magazine that's one of our national magazines and I slowly build it up, one little freelance job at a time and I always took good pictures of my jobs and I made portfolios of my drawings, always presenting it really neatly. The first thing you gotta do is if you're in art or something you can put on a phone, get it on your phone. Because you never know where you're going to meet somebody, let's say is programming. Let's put some of your really good code and you can say well I wrote this language, it does this, in this much memory, you know, and you're… you're… Oh, now this really messed up now. But they… they, you know, so you have something to show. It's starting it out and this is where things like paper (inaudible), you know, have helped people. Because you gotta not only deliver the papers even when the weather's nasty, you gotta go collect the money for it and… and I've just started out one little thing at a time. You know, let's say when I look at art work, some of its really good, some of its not so good. No, you gotta get out there and do it, you know, there's an ad for, you know, of Nike that says 'Just do it,' well, at a point where you gotta just do it, but another thing I learned and I learned in my 20s, is you never know where someone can open the door. You know, I was at a cattle feeders meeting and I got to talking somebody, showed him some drawings and then I got hired. I was at a cattle show covering a cattle show the 4-H & FFA cattle show uh… up in Arizona and the manager of Feed Yard came up to me and asked me if I would design a new dipping barn. Now there's an interesting thing, men will often take a job when they feel only 60% competent, girls want to be 90th% competent. I was about 60% knowledgeable and I said 'I'll do it, but give me three weeks.' Because I had to go and learn a bunch of stuff about water pumps and stuff like this that I needed to have for the dip (inaudible) so I was on the phone the next day at Texas A & M University getting all these drawings and calling up the USDA and getting drawings for concrete work, engineering on reinforcement steel and I did it. You know, the door opened and only opens for a second and too often I've seen somebody turn something down like I heard about a girl brilliant in art, she was offered a full scholarship and she turned it down because she didn't feel competent enough. No, she should've gone through that door. It only opens for just a second and I said 'Yes, but give me three weeks.' And I was at the 60% knowledgeable level. And now I find out, you know, like 35 years later this thing about, you know, guys will take a job when they're 60% competence, then you get some that take a job when they're 10% competent and they make a mess out of it. I've seen that too. I've seen that in engineering. I've seen a guy thing he can design everything in a plan, well, that's just ridiculous not the same person can't design electrical plumbing, heating and air conditioning, I mean… and the refrigeration stuff in the plans is very… very specialized. I know just enough about it to stay a zillion miles away from that. You have to have somebody who's very competent in that and then there's someone who I saw planned one time when he thought this guy thought he could build everything and he wrecked a refrigeration system at a plant, you know, too big an eagle. Okay, right there. 

02:53:10
[sil.] 

02:53:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay, the question concerns self-motivation. When I was young, I used to… When I was young, I used to like make things out of cardboard paper and tape. You know, when I was really young I couldn't cut the big heavy cardboard because my hand wasn't strong enough and (inaudible) knives I was not given that. And… and… and I would experiment for hours like making these kites, different airplane wings and things like that out of paper. And what does your son like you do? Build on something you kinda of fixated on what does he like to do? He likes to do (inaudible). All right, s he likes to build things with Legos. Okay, let's start doing assignments where he's going to make something with Legos that something somebody else wants. Because when I was young, I just draw a constant horse (inaudible) let's do a beach. And then I get a watercolor of a beach and she put it in a professional frame in the, you know, in the bedroom on the wall and the real frame, you know, that's… But brought that out let's start doing Lego assignments, you're making something somebody else wants. What kind of things he'd like to build with Legos? Well, let's do Lego assignments. Because you've got to start learning how to do tasks that other people want and appreciate. You know, at least he likes to build Legos maybe… maybe he needs to start building things using some other different materials. How old is he now? 

02:54:50
UNKNOWN He just turned nine. 

02:54:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, maybe try some other materials. Maybe you can introduce him to Lego robotics. You know, and there's great robotics classes you can go in. You know, where you start programming a little computer to make robots do things and that are entered in contests, you know, build on it and then from that learn some engineering principles. You see, you build on that interest, you always tapping into that fixation. You use the motivation of the fixation to motivate useful stuff. Oh, I'm glad he likes to make things Legos that's easy to work with. 

02:55:25
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

02:55:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay, how about right here? 

02:55:35
[sil.] 

02:55:40
UNKNOWN I had my question on one of the sheets so I'll go ahead and ask it. I've a 34-year-old son who's regressing from Asperger's. 

02:55:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Now is he fully verbal? 

02:55:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

02:55:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN He's fully verbal. 

02:55:55
UNKNOWN And he's certainly bright, he knows math theory about… 

02:55:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN He's very… very good at math. Now what does he been doing when he's 34 years old? 

02:55:55
UNKNOWN He now remains in his home. He does nothing at all. 

02:56:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN What was he doing before? What was he doing in his 20s? 

02:56:00
UNKNOWN Uh… He tried to go to college, but couldn't do that either (inaudible) to college. If you want to just talk to the professors and they wouldn't allow me just talk to… 

02:56:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN And he didn't ever get a job. 

02:56:10
UNKNOWN No. 

02:56:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Is he taking any medication? 

02:56:15
UNKNOWN Yes, he does. He takes medication for bipolar disorder, which is (inaudible) a lot of problems right now. 

02:56:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay, he got bipolar. Well, the other thing that often helps us exercise. I do 100 sit-ups every night and if I didn't do 100 sit-ups every night I wouldn't be able to sleep. He needs to exercise… 

02:56:30
UNKNOWN Have you ever known anyone to regress with the Asperger's into just basically becoming a total recluse? 

02:56:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, you see, this is the problem. And… and you see, this could have happened to me. As I went through my 20s, my anxiety got worse and… worse and… worse to horrible panic attacks and that I had medical problem where they had to a little skin cancer of my eyelid with plastic surgery, I totally freaked out from the stress of that. And fortunately I read an article in Psychology Today called the Promise of Biological Psychiatry and I read about using antidepressants for anxiety. Now you gotta remember this is late 70s. This is before Prozac was invented. And I went looked up the scientists, I used my, you know, library skills looked up at journal articles of and found this article about endogenous anxiety. And the symptoms described me and they were treating it with an… with a drug called Imipramine which is one of the old-fashion antidepressants and I went on that medication on very low dose of it and it was… it… it really helped. Now of course with bipolar, you got to be very… very careful with antidepressants not to trip off a manic phase. 

02:57:35
UNKNOWN Yes. An OCD, do you have any suggestions on OCD as far as medications or (inaudible) a medication. 

02:57:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I use things like, you know, Prozac, but the first thing, you see, there's two ways to work with these problems. Medications work on the primitive bottom parts of the brain, cognitive therapy and things like that work on the top of the brain, so you gotta hit the brain from both ends in a combination. First of all we gotta start trying to get him out, need to get him exercising. 

02:58:00
UNKNOWN Yes, ma'am. 

02:58:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Maybe take some fish oil supplements. The research is very clear that the omega-3s are really good for the brain. Like I say (inaudible), but omega-3 is good for the brain and exercise. You see, I do 100 sit-ups fast because you gotta get that burst of energy and get the blood pumping and get the heart pumping, and that I wouldn't sleep if I wasn't doing. I do them every night on the bed in the hotel and I hate every single one of them. And… and I've got start get… we gotta start getting him out uh… maybe get him on an exercise, you know, just start getting him on an exercise program. You see, (inaudible) a recluse in the room it just gets worse, you see, that's the problem. We've got to start trying to pull him out of that. What's the OCD about? 

02:58:45
UNKNOWN Everything. His… his laundry, everything he's gonna wash his hands… 

02:58:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Dirty? 

02:58:50
UNKNOWN It's severe. 

02:58:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN All right. Okay, now the way that they deal with, you know, fear of dirt is you start touching dirty things, you know, gradually in a controlled way touching dirty things like one from OCD person, I put my hand down on the floor of the airport and then I licked it, I'm still here. Now there are some places I'll not do that. Uh… A bunch of dog poop, I would not do it. But this hotel rug, I would. Because this isn't where the high bacterial counts are, it's the door handles. That's where they're at. 

02:59:25
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

02:59:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN What you have to do… you have to see on that OCD. You use medication but the other thing is you have to do therapy on controlled exposure to handling dirt, you start with something a little bit dirty and then graduate to more dirtier things. 

02:59:40
UNKNOWN I just have a comment 'I'm part of Temple's other world in the livestock industry. She and I have worked together for about 10 years on committees in speaking at different conferences. So I'm really out of my element, but I just must say Temple, it's… it's good for me to see your other world because I'm so familiar with your livestock world. 

03:00:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, thank you very… very much. And I think there's things that in the lives… That we can learn from the livestock world because I'm gonna bet you out because you worked as an auditor, you're going around to all these meat packing plants, these chicken operations and all that stuff like that. How many kinds of quirky, nerdy Asperger types have you seen working in these places? 

03:00:15
UNKNOWN Well, you know, we call ourselves auditor geeks, you know, (inaudible) when you get a group of auditor geeks together. So I do see a lot of tendencies (inaudible) you're so close to my home, I live in the next county over Manchester so to be able to come and see this par and addressed it to what we do in the animal part of the world and… and definitely see some of the tendencies with the people who work with animals. 

03:00:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, yeah, and they've got good jobs and they've kept those jobs. And the thing is they've got to get… A lot of these kids aren't getting… getting exposed to that things and this is why I'm so concerned about taken out all the… all the different kinds of classes because how you gonna know you like theatre if you don't do it, how do you know you're gonna like a musical instrument if you don't do it, how do you know you're gonna like cattle if you don't work with them. You know, these are things I… I was exposed to cattle in high school. 

03:01:00
UNKNOWN Well, and what we do in the animal world is a lot of hands-on? 

03:01:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's right. 

03:01:05
UNKNOWN A lot of… 

03:01:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN 4-H & FFA, those are great events. And you need to work on getting 4-H going and one of the best places to get it going is poultry projects. They can be done very cheaply in people's backyards, they can grow 10 broilers, so you make like 10 Tyson chickens in your backyard or you have hens… fancy hens and you sell them, me done very… very inexpensively. You know, these are… these are kind of things, you know, that the whole local food movement thing, grow your own food, get these kids involved with farmers markets, that's another great thing. And I was in England two years ago and I met a lady that has her own purebred cattle now that she raises and sells. And when she was a teenager, she worked in her parents store and learned the working skills. She's an Asperger's she could be. See this is what makes me crazy when I go over to my other world. 

03:02:00
UNKNOWN Uh… I'm going to put the microphone on the stand over here so if you guys want a lineup right over here in the second aisle, so that everybody can just line up. Cool. Thanks. 

03:02:15
LINDA Yeah, yes, I'm Linda (inaudible) from Warm Springs. I work at the Roosevelt Rehabilitation Center and I teach driving. 

03:02:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay. 

03:02:25
LINDA And I'd like to know was it difficult for you to drive? 

03:02:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN I had… I've spent a year on real easy roads before I did downtown city traffic or freeways with lots of traffic. And the way I learned on my aunt's ranch was three miles up to the mailbox to get the mail every day and three miles back, so that was a whole summer, six days a week on dirt roads and then I… I drove on a lot of county roads, it's going to take longer and more practice to just learn the operation of the car. Because when you learn a motor skill, when you first start to learn it, you have to think about steering, you have to think about the gas and the breaks, and then that skill moves from the frontal cortex where you have to think about it, back into the motor cortex and you want to get the operation of the car braking and, you know, steering and all that sort of on automatic mode in the brain. I think you need to burn up at least twofold tanks of gas driving around totally safe environments, like big gigantic parking lots or, you know, really empty kind of country roads. Umm… San Francisco there's an old abandoned military base that's actually still got the houses there that's kind of a great place to learn and finally safe places and really practice… practice… practice… practice… practice is going to take longer and then you slowly do slightly busier roads and then your graduation is how to merge onto a busy freeway, that's well, you don't start off with that right away. It's just gonna take longer to learn. 

03:04:00
LINDA Okay, so we… we tried to give them the basics and then let them work with their parents. 

03:04:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, then they gotta get out and do many hours of practice. 

03:04:05
LINDA Right. 

03:04:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN And I'm… It's gonna be two or three tanks of gas burned up a practice in real easy safe places, practice parking, practice turning. I try out a big deserted empty parking lot somewhere or… or… or around here you might go on (inaudible) going out in the field but in some parts of the country, you could go out on a dry fields and practice. But some you gotta learn how to park it, turn it, move it, you gotta learn how to control that car to where you don't have to think about it. You see, this solves the problem with the multi-tasking. 

03:04:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

03:04:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Then, after they get to where they don't have to think about the operation of the car, then you start to go out and do a little bit of traffic. 

03:04:50
UNKNOWN Well, I think the part I see is they know what to do and they see it, but they respond at a stop sign at the last minute. 

03:05:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN While the first thing they've gotta do is… Learn how to operate the car without thinking about it. Then, you take him out on take easy roads where there is stop sign and you start practice. 

03:05:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:05:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN It's… And it's a lot of practice and I would say two or three tanks the gas burned up on really easy places and that might not be true for everybody, but that was sort of, you know, my situation. 

03:05:20
UNKNOWN okay, thank you. 

03:05:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay, over here. I can't hear you. Oh, there's no mike there, okay. Okay. 

03:05:35
[sil.] 

03:05:40
UNKNOWN Okay, hi. Umm… My question for you is my son is three and he has autism but he's also deaf. So he has cochlear implants, but his hearing is like at a moderate level so I was wondering what your thoughts might be on the best way to teach him? 

03:06:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I would when you talk to him, slow down. 

03:06:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:06:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN Because there's a cochlear implants don't work as well as the ears, but he can learn to hear with them. 

03:06:05
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

03:06:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Slow down, talk slowly. You know, that's one, you know, don't talk too fast. 

03:06:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

03:06:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) I help him. And… and this thing is shown on all of the early intervention stuff is the importance of enough hours every week, 20 or 30 hours a week when the effective teacher, keeping the kid engage. Everybody's gonna fight over exactly which program you use. 

03:06:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

03:06:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Whatever one will agree that these kids need a lot of hours of one-to-one with an effective teacher. Well, what's an effective teacher? One that gets more speech, gets more social interaction. 

03:06:45
UNKNOWN Okay, yeah, he go to school… 

03:06:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's an effective teaching. Some teachers have a knack on just how to push these kids and some teachers don't have a knack. 

03:06:55
UNKNOWN Okay. All right, well, thank you. 

03:06:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay. 

03:06:55
ALEXANDRA HAWK Hello, my name is Alexandra Hawk and I have Asperger syndrome. Umm… What I would like to ask you is well, my friends and I have a very hard time interacting with normal people… well, people who do not have syndrome are not on spectrum and also adults because as well we have bullying problems like… 

03:07:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Where are you in high school or where you (inaudible). 

03:07:20
ALEXANDRA HAWK Umm… I'm in middle school I'm 14 years old. 

03:07:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay. 

03:07:25
ALEXANDRA HAWK And also umm… like my friend, Jonathan. Umm… He had a very… very hard time recently like someone does something so bad I saw I'm not (inaudible) what it is, but it resulted in him ripping the door off a locker because he could not basically he knew he was not hurt the person who did it to him, but so how do you think we should respond to other people, I mean… 

03:07:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, not by ripping the door of a locker, you know, they… they… 

03:07:55
ALEXANDRA HAWK Yeah. 

03:07:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN All right, now the thing is where I… I had a terrible time, you know, now at puberty coming earlier I was 14 when I went to puberty that has gotten worse. Umm… You know, where I had friends who they shared interests, you know, for me it was horses, model rockets and electronics. For somebody else it's gonna be might be theatre or it might be music. Those have been good areas maybe art. 

03:08:25
ALEXANDRA HAWK But the problem is in my school for last two years, they've actually seem to be trying to put me into somewhere where there's no one is sharing my interests because they seem to think that if they get me out of my comfort zone of people that I like… 

03:08:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well… well, what is your interest? 

03:08:40
ALEXANDRA HAWK My interest is art umm… 

03:08:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay. 

03:08:45
ALEXANDRA HAWK Social Studies as well as I'm kinda interested in psychology, but I'm not quite sure if I want to head down that field, but I'm also really into Shakespeare Theatre. Basically… 

03:08:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Why don't you go (inaudible) you like theater. Does your school have a school play? 

03:09:00
ALEXANDRA HAWK Umm… Not really. We also don't have… We don't have art programs either. 

03:09:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) well, I think this is something that's a real fault in… in the educational system because there (inaudible) be where you need to go, but you see, if they don't have a school play, then you don't know that theaters where you want to go. 

03:09:20
ALEXANDRA HAWK Yeah, but I was just wondering how do you respond to one other people act this way towards you because, Jonathan, he responded in if he was… It was good thing he didn't kill the person like ripped the head off as I said the locker door, but how do you respond to them yourself that you're (inaudible) a situation where you have to respond to them? 

03:09:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, you known, there're some kids. I was a kid when… Now you are 14, when I was 14, I'd to be pulled out of a regular school. And… and, you know, now you can finish up online. I don't know what the law is here in Colorado, you can go and… Safe employment at age 14 on the regular economy in Colorado like… like working at AT & T telephone store for example would be. 

03:10:00
ALEXANDRA HAWK I… I'm from Mississippi. 

03:10:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Okay… okay. We're going to have to end it. I'm… I'm really sorry. I'm getting a queue here. We're going to have to end it or maybe I talk you during the break. And I just wanna thank everybody for coming. Thank you. 

03:10:15
[sil.] 

03:10:20
R. WAYNE GILPIN Of all the sessions that we've ever had, this one I've been looking forward to it very most not only this day, but this particular session. Umm… Where you're in for a great treat and I can't tell you what's going to be said in the next hour and a half. We have two intelligent women up here that are free to say whatever they'd like to say without any controls at all obviously and I'm gonna learn along with… with you. So we'll just start with this. Over the past 67 years how have your relationships evolved or… or changed? That's for either of you. 

03:11:05
[sil.] 

03:11:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, that left both of asylum, didn't it. I think they've evolved as they have over the years wonderfully. I and Temple forever proud of you as well as loving. 

03:11:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Thank you… thank you. Oh, what you can't hear me? 

03:11:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible) with your mom. 

03:11:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, the mike is right on, it's turned on. The… the mike is under your collar… 

03:11:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER How's that? Well, it's not. Oh, there it goes. I've to be much closer. 

03:11:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, just to pin it on so it's on the… 

03:11:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Wait a minute, it's not working that well. 

03:11:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Let me just… let me just get it so it could be on the top of your collar like let's try that… 

03:12:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER Okay, how's that… I can hear it. 

03:12:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN You can't have your collar covered up. 

03:12:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER Okay. 

03:12:05
R. WAYNE GILPIN Eustacia, what was the single most difficult challenge you faced in raising Temple? That's great answer. 

03:12:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER More than one. But I do think well, I didn't talk about it because it is a down subject. Uh… I think the most difficult was trying to deal with Temple's father and I knew the good man he wanted to be as he would say 'If somebody would just tell me what to do, I'll do it.' Well, as you all know it doesn't work that way. So when I worked out something for Temple to do, he'd said 'Well, that's not the way it's supposed to be.' Well, let's try it. He couldn't… He couldn't go there and what was the most difficult of all was he tried to prove that I was insane so that he could get custody of all four of our children and put you, Temple in an institution. I don't know why he came up with such a crazy plan. And it was in the Era of Bettelheim where it might well have worked. I was rescued by two doctors. By the… by the Vietnamese doctor (inaudible) that I told you about and by another doctor. The two of them face Temple's father and said 'If you tried to take… to take your wife to court, the proof that is incompetent, we are both going to testify against you.' Those two doctors rescued me and that was the most difficult challenge of all that I faced and for all… all time I feel terribly sad about it. Because when I left, I took four children and happiness, and over and over I dream of trying for his forgiving me and for my forgiving him. Because I did take, I was the one who left and there was no other way to do it. As I look back over the years I don't think I had a choice. Sorry to get started on such a dark note. 

03:14:50
R. WAYNE GILPIN As I said at the beginning you say whatever you want to say. 

03:14:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, maybe I need to say something. 

03:14:55
R. WAYNE GILPIN Yes. 

03:14:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN A lot of these things are going on in the family, it was not dragged out fights throwing stuff, so I wasn't really aware of it. Because I didn't picked up social, subtle, signals. Uh… The things that were hardest for me, adolescents, absolutely the worst. Large school what a mess, bullying, teasing. I was one of the kids where the large regular high school did not worked and fortunately my parents had the assets to send me to this special country boarding school. Now a lot of the things that were done with me when I was a young are not difficult things to do, like party hostess, table manners, board games. A lot of things that helped me in elementary school were an old-fashioned 50s upbringing and adolescence was totally dreadful and the worst part was going through my 20s, the anxiety got worse until I discovered the antidepressant medication. Now there's way too many medications given out to kids like candy. But I was one of the ones where, you know, where there's a visual thinker that, you know, I was falling apart from stressful related health problems the… that the antidepressant low-dose stopped the colitis and other problems. That was very… very difficult. Now the other thing that's wrong is people always looked for thus single magic turning point a recent one. You know, my first book was originally called 'Emergence.' Because I think that's a good (inaudible) gradually change. You know, people tell me, my talks are better at age 60 than they were at age 50. You see, you keep changing and there also, you know, mother was a first-person work (inaudible) and there was Mr. Carlock, the science teacher, there was Ann at the ranch. But then after I was out in Arizona, there were some good people in the cattle industry like Jim (inaudible), the contract. Who seek me out because he knew that I had talent. There was Ted Gilbert at the Red River Feet guard, uh… it was the cowboys that were nasty. It was not the feedlot managers, they actually a lot liked me. And this is where, you know, talent, if you have ability that attracts mentors. Well, there were good people all along. When I was in college, the Dean's wife Mrs. (inaudible), I think she probably was on the spectrum. She was helpful. There was Mr. (inaudible) the wonderful Brian new mathematics teacher, who during office hours tutored me. He did the whole lecture over again after every class. These are people who helped me. 

03:17:30
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Temple, what kind of teasing did you face when you're a teenager and how did you… how did you react to it? 

03:17:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, very badly. The main things with teenager I was called 'Bones' because I was skinny, and when I walk across the parking lot, they go 'Bones!' and then I was called tape recorder. And I couldn't figure out why I was called tape recorder. Now I realized that I was called that because I always used the same phrases all the time and it was called workhorse. Well, because I was working in a horse barn all the time. Yeah, but actually I think Mr. (inaudible) the headmaster realized even though I wasn't learning very much academics at the time, I was learning how to work because he bought me special insulated boots so my feet would freeze off in the horse barn because we were in the Hampshire, you know, learning how to work right now it's somebody smart asked (inaudible) it's a worse problem we have right now, they're not learning how to work and I know the one thing Mr. (inaudible) absolutely would not allow is becoming a recluse in my room that was absolutely not allowed, this is where I had a choice of running the movie projector for movie night or I could… I could sit in the audience, but staying in my room that was not going to be an option just that simple. You know, and the teasing was horrible and I responded by laughing out and fighting, and that's where I had to switch from anger to cry. And the only places where I was not teased was shared interests and that was mainly on horseback riding, model rockets, the electronics and science lab, I did some skiing that also was fairly safe refuge. And there's a few silly things like we made giant stilts two-by-fours and when I was out doing that, I wasn't getting teased. You see, it was doing an activity with those shared interests, but cafeteria, walking across the parking lot, it was absolutely horrible. High school is the worst part of my life and there are some kids that they need to be pulled out, yeah, pull him out, finish up online, you're working bud and you better find something in the informal economy if the kids too young. You know, I just talk to one girl out there in the lobby where you need to start art business online, doing digital art. You don't have… you can start that as a little kid. You gotta get working, can't be setting around home. 

03:19:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, I… I would just like to add to that one of the things that Mr. (inaudible) did that I think is so valuable. Was he insisted that you take responsibility and I remember that starting back with your sister when you were both quite little and you… you wanted to go downtown and spend your allowance on candy, downtown being the little down… the store section of (inaudible) which was very small… 

03:20:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN Maybe a mile away. 

03:20:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER And a short bike ride. I said 'Your sister can't see that well. She's not that good, can you take responsibility for her?' And you… you said 'Yes, I can.' And we'll put our bikes back at the police station because nobody will take them from the back of the police station. It was the beginning of responsibility and then Mr. (inaudible) built on that he insisted that you take responsibility for the horses. I think that's invaluable. 

03:20:50
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… For… for Eustacia, were you aware that Temple was being teased and how did that make you feel? 

03:21:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER What's that? Say that again? 

03:21:00
R. WAYNE GILPIN Were you aware that Temple was being teased and how did that make you feel? 

03:21:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes and no. I… I kind of knew because I kind of saw some of that action. I… The first place it was at the height of my own very serious battle so it wasn't as though I had a lot of attention, time to give attention to it. It was… it looks very… very severe to the one being teased, but to the outsider, it doesn't look (inaudible). 

03:21:40
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay. Temple, have you known Asperger syndrome persons too regress after the age of 25? Is there any treatment or medicine directly to assist the complexity of OCD? 

03:22:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, in my own case, I was one of the ones where my anxiety and nervousness got worse through my 20s and what saved that was the right medication. You know, there's way too many meds, given out to little kids like candy, it's just horrible Risperdal being given out terrible. Like, I was on the ones by the time I got to early 30s getting a little bit of the right antidepressant and in my case it's an old-fashion tricyclic, now on dispiramine, it stopped a lot of that OCD stuff, it stopped a lot of those panic attacks and saved me, I wouldn't be here now. There's a… there's a place for the right meds and I've talked to a lot of people when they finally get on the right meds, they're nice and stable, they might be taking two things reasonable dose, not getting fat or having some horrible side effects. And they do something stupid like go off the prescription. You know, if you are stable on some nice day will you stay on it, don't forget to refill your prescription when it ran out. But as visual thinkers they can (inaudible) real problems with that and I am the person really needs medication The other thing is you've got to hit problems from both the top and the bottom of the brain. Drugs treat the more primitive parts of the brain, therapy treats the more top of the brain, the thinking part is right. We can't just let them become recluses because that's just gonna make me worse and… worse and… worse and… worse. So you're gonna have that like cognitive behavior therapy for the top of the brain and some medication to hit the bottom of the brain. 

03:23:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay, Eustacia, as a parent whose life changed from that of where you first thought it might have headed. Who was your inspiration or where did you get the strength to keep moving… moving forward? 

03:23:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh, that's really interesting. I think it was a combination. First of all, I trusted Dr. Caruthers and I trusted the Vietnamese doctor. And they loaded my efforts. So it seemed important to continue them. I also was attracted to the theatre and worked in a creative theatre in Cambridge called The Poets Theatre. The poets' who now writes for The New Yorker were all there. And these people I went there, I didn't… They knew I had children, but they didn't know that I had an autistic child. I don't know that they even knew that word. It was only years later that I learned that the poet, Richard Wilbur, whose first translation of Maliya of the Missing Thorne. I played this first celibate of that… Translation that became famous. I didn't know that he had an autistic child. We never talked about it. But that creative power gave me a trust in my own creative power. I went there whatever was being said to be at home, I knew these people thought I was creative. I thought therefore I can be creative with Temple. In fact with all my children. 

03:25:25
[sil.] 

03:25:30
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay. Umm… again, Eustacia, can you tell us anything more about Temple's… Temple's dad and maybe their react… their… their… their interaction? 

03:25:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, Temple's interaction with whom? 

03:25:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Her dad. 

03:25:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER I don't know, Temple then have to speak up for that. Because there was this strange business about sometimes it was all right and sometimes it wasn't. He would flare up and said 'That's not the way it's supposed to be.' And as I look back now I feel that he was on the spectrum. He was probably Asperger and no wonder that being the case that I would my creative urges saying 'Well, why don't we do this?' Was more than he could bear? So there were times Temple when he clearly did love you. Other times where he wanted it all changed and made easy and cleared up. And… and he would yell at me 'Just say the word (inaudible).' Well, I couldn't say it. And that's why in time I broke my vocal cords, which certainly silence me for a bit. I couldn't speak at all for six weeks. I couldn't raise my voice for three years. I couldn't sing again because I'm a singer for seven years. But despite that I think he thought by yelling at… at me he could make everything go back to where it was before there was a problem. Because I know somewhere in his heart, he loved you. 

03:27:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I actually had some good times with him. And one of the things I used to do, we would play cards and also what I get them to tell stories, silly stories. And it was always about somebody like the Three Magazine or Three Pencils. You know, (inaudible) make up some little story on how these, you know, three silly objects like that and then I'd work… He'd like one (inaudible) and I would be out my help lead the landscaping, we get that and he had a boat and I would polish the fittings on the boat and we had a lot of good times on the boat. So there were times that, you know, things are good, there were times when things were bad when my sister and I got in a ketchup squirting fight and I ran out the door and he went in a rage and… and he went after me and he started to slam me into the stonewall and mother was back there like a tigress going 'Jack, stop it! stop it!' 

03:28:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER It was awful. 

03:28:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN It was really awful. 

03:28:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER It's awful. 

03:28:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN It was absolutely awful and now there are other times where and his rages were brought on by the dumbest, stupidest things, you know, kids squirting ketchup it's just really dumb things. And there were other times where, you know, we had… we had good times. 

03:28:40
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Temple, I know from talking to your mother that you occasionally with your sister put on plays? 

03:28:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, we put on plays yeah. 

03:28:50
R. WAYNE GILPIN And what… what were they about and… and what inspired you to be putting on a play? 

03:28:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I think it's all of it is, you know, when mother was really into plays. I can remember going to the Poets Theatre and I wasn't exactly a theatre with a lot of money. Their lights remain (inaudible) out of big institutional sized fruit vegetable cans from the kitchen and so I think that might have gotten some of the idea of… of plays and, you know, it would be something from a movie or, you know, when our school had plays, I can remember mother running The Wizard of Oz play at our school. Umm… You know, you get interested in theatre because you get exposed to it again, it brings back whole thing you gotta expose kids to interesting things, you get them interested in interesting things. And I was just talking a girl who is really good in art here and I found that her school has no art program, that's terrible because I think she could go into a career and… and do art commercial. 

03:29:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, let me add to that. I remember when you were six and your sister was four, and I was playing in another theatre. Playing a mermaid… 

03:29:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I remember that. 

03:30:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER And then all of a sudden and even your sister has told me she couldn't believe that all of a sudden her mother just her ordinary everyday mother had been turned into this strange glittering green creature. 

03:30:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN I remember that. 

03:30:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER Now to add to it Temple, I remembered there was an afternoon performance with a lucky number drawn. 

03:30:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN I remember that. 

03:30:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER So I went to somebody and I said 'I want my daughters to draw the lucky number.' Back in those days you didn't mind wearing a dress and you and your sister were dress alike and up you trotted on the stage with a follow spot following you and the audience all applauding and you turn the crank and drew the lucky number. 'Well, the combination of the two that's when I saw that (inaudible) you came home, nothing would do with putting on shows, we… we hung up sheets in the bedroom. There was lots of costumes, lots of makeup, lots of leading characters. I don't think it had anything to do with plot. 

03:31:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN No, it didn't. 

03:31:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER It had to do with performing and that's where I saw its start. 

03:31:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I remember that costume it was green sequence for your mermaid tail. I remember that really well. 

03:31:20
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay. Umm… Eustacia, how did you share with Temple that she was on the spectrum? Explain it and how did it affect you and also her? 

03:31:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, I don't think I shared it with Temple. Uh… 

03:31:40
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay. 

03:31:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER The only thing I remember is when she was about… You must have been maybe 9 or maybe 10, and you asked me why am I different? You didn't ask me am I different? You'd already figured that out. You ask me why? I said 'I don't know why.' But it doesn't make any difference you're… you're you, you're who you are. And at that age you scampered off the topic and I thought 'Okay, we won't go any further.' And you asked me something dumb like 'Where did the butterflies go when it rains?' Now you have told me later that you didn't realize about autism to you were in your teens. I think that all of us we faced certain things when we're able to face them. I think sometimes I see this with parents the denial isn't the worst thing in the world they deny until they have the… the strength to face what… what they some… some part of them has known all along that they'd have to face and you weren't ready to face being autistic till you were… Do you remember what age you were? 

03:33:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, the other thing you gotta remember that back in the 50s and 60s, there were no books available, there was no internet I could've looked it up on things like that. 

03:33:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER No. 

03:33:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN Because if there had been I probably would've asked what autism was. Because it would have gotten mentioned and I would've looked it up on Google. I… I can remember the things that helped me the most in literature or first-person accounts those were very… very helpful to me and I had copies of all early ones and also some scientific research on how the brain works. Those were things that were… that were very… very helpful. I… you've gotta remember it was an era where none of the materials that all the books and stuff, we have today, none of that stuff existed. I can remember (inaudible) first book published back in the 60s. I was in graduate school and I got exposed to that book. 

03:34:00
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… For those of you that don't know I will tell you because I've seen it. First Person is that Temple is just as revered that's the right term, honored I should say in the world of Animal Science and cattle she is in the field of autism, most of you in the room know her through autism, but people in the cattle world many of them don't even know that she's part of the Autism World. So based upon that question before you were famous, Temple for both Autism and for cattle, how did friends, teachers and other people in the… in the community treat you? 

03:34:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, in the 70s when I was getting started in the cattle industry being a woman was really the issue, you know, I was one of the pioneers, the autism really didn't have much to do with it. That maybe the autism helped me because I was fixated on (inaudible) conquering the cattle and… But the thing I got recognized for my work when I started writing for the magazine, I remember a guy came to me that worked (inaudible) construction company and he said 'You're famous for two things in… in Arizona, you're smart but you are also like really weird.' (inaudible) Construction Company and that's where the secretaries went out and I had to get the deodorant, I'd to clean myself up, I'm not dressed like such slog and all those sort of things. And there were people that recognize the bullying. They said when I write for Arizona fire arrangement and I cover the Arizona Cattle Feeders Meeting, it's covered accurately and people respected that, you see, again that's… that's selling work I never misquoted anybody when I covered that meeting. And… and I started to build up a portfolio that way. And that's one reason why I put so much emphasis on portfolios because that's how I got ahead. 

03:35:55
R. WAYNE GILPIN Once you became famous and I think its okay to… to make that… that assumption. How has that… How people treated you differently and how do you feel about that… that thing? 

03:36:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I have lots of people come up to me at the airport and I feel it's a responsibility… it's a responsibility. And always got to be on good behavior, always got to be nice and only time I was not nice, was at the Denver Airport when I came out of the toilet stall and a lady shoved an iPhone on my face outside the toilet stall and I said 'Not in the restroom.' You know, other than that I always try to be really nice because, you know, people look up to me and I kind of treat it almost like a job I've got to, you know, you sometimes (inaudible) I ask what's the meaning of life? You know, I used to look for all kinds of things when I was young and now I kind of look at it very simply, if the things that you do, you know, influence the world in a positive way like some of little (inaudible) kid went to college because of your book or things that you said about teaching him how to work, you know, really your helped our family or someone like cattle handling facility, I design and help them with their cattle that's… that's sort of the meaning of life. Another thing I learned really early on as we got a lot of people in this country where money is everything, like our best and our brightest at Harvard now wanna work for the finance industry. You know, they get lots of money, but you know, I learned some other things from the construction industry and I talked about the construction industry in my talk this morning about how that affected me on outcomes. I (inaudible) not just a kid to (inaudible) he's an Asperger, fully verbal type (inaudible) yet I want to get a good job and a good career, if he sit at home playing video games and social security that's not good outcome, that's bad outcome. But another place with the construction industry really affected me was my early… in my 20s. I get some jobs for some very rich clients. People they'd like two jet airplanes in the garage, oil wells on their property, all kinds of stuff like that and, you know, what I learned that much money did not buy happiness. You have to have enough money, you know, so you can live, but two jet airplanes in your garage do not buy happiness. You know, and… and that made a big impression on me. 

03:38:15
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… how did you feel Temple, about how to… how do you feel, not deal. How do feel about being famous and how do you, I mean, understand… 

03:38:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I… I remember when I was in graduate school, I had posted (inaudible) that I had in my wallet (inaudible) poster shops, you back then no internet, so I post shops. And I had one on creativity like Alan Ashley-Pitt and that was one of them, (inaudible) look that up online on creativity by Alan Ashley-Pitt and then another poster I saw, I didn't buy this poster. But I remember seeing it. It showed some famous person, pigeons roosting all over his statue and there pigeon poop is dripping down the statue that so that's what happens when I get famous. And the other thing I'd seen a lot of people that are famous mess up, they think because they're famous they can get away with doing all kinds of bad things like, you know, big-time drunk driving or something like that? No, you can't. You've always got to be on good behavior. 

03:39:20
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… For Eustacia, how did you feel and how did you react when you suddenly realized, I mean, suddenly gradually realized that your daughter was… was famous? 

03:39:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER That she was famous? 

03:39:30
R. WAYNE GILPIN Yes. 

03:39:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER It didn't change things that much. I wasn't surprised, but I felt… yeah, great. I think what I admired most of all, you spoke of the difficulty when you first started, you have to remember Temple, you did this before Women's Lib. 

03:39:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's right. 

03:39:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER And those men were against you, they didn't care whether you're autistic, they didn't… they were prepared to destroy your machinery at great cost to the company… 

03:40:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) conveyors meat company. 

03:40:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Meat company and why because you were a woman. So you are part of that battle women have had what we call Women's Lib, a very important battle and a treasure that I think that registered on me first and deepest. And thank you. 

03:40:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN You know, I can. 

03:40:35
[sil.] 

03:40:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN It's very hard for me uh… like they used to call us jealous engineer syndrome, the plant manager liked me. It wasn't the plant manager who did this. They were the ones who hired me. It be the resident engineer than like girl geek coming in on his territory and (inaudible) mysteriously he got shoved in conveyers and things like that and it was very difficult for me to understand why a company would cost thousands of dollars worth of downtime, you see, because (inaudible) will announce like $300 a minute for plant is not operating, you see, back then it was more like $150 a minute, you know, and cause all of this downtown. You know, now I chalk it up to like normal bad human behavior that I used to say engineering's easy, it's the people problems that are difficult. But on the other hand there were people that, you know, there were some very good people building contracting and equipment manufacturer that did support me. You know, so along there were the bad people, they also were a lot of good people that recognized my abilities. 

03:41:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… The movie interestingly name Temple Grandin, came out in 2010 as you both know won seven Emmys. How… What was your reaction of your friends and your neighbors for both of you to that movie coming out? 

03:42:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER You… you joined to be? 

03:42:05
R. WAYNE GILPIN Both of you. 

03:42:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Both of us. Okay, I think on the whole, this film has been a great help in putting forward the problem of autism. I regret that they couldn't leave the truth alone uh… and that's confusing to mothers I already said this to some mother who came up, uh… but I'll say it again 'No doctor recommended that Temple be institutionalized.' The doctor prescribed speech lessons that's important to know. Could I have stood up again before Women's Lib, against the entire medical profession? No, I couldn't. Not possibly. I was guided by the best. I also regret the fact that when it came to the Hampshire Country School that was a school for teenagers with autism. It was not for advanced students. It was for those on the spectrum. Again I think, parents deserve to know this because it distorts the picture. It… it takes away also from what everybody contributed to your advancement through life and all I want all families to have that opportunity above all, it's one of the reasons right now Temple and I have started the Temple Grandin Eustacia Cutler autism Fund website. And one of the things that we're working on is a series of webinars which will be free to all parents, information interviews with the top authorities on autism in the country. Also people connected bankers, businessmen, theater people, all of whom who have a stature in our culture and some very specific connection to autism. We must put this cultural picture together. This is of the utmost importance. And these webinars are free, they're being transcribed, they will be prominently on the website, you just have to go there, if you want to listen there to be a collection of interviews to be looked at relooked at over and over again. And they're yours at no cost because now that I'm here on my soapbox I have to add it distresses me what I talked about earlier this morning, the professionalism of autism which is bringing great profits to a lot of… lot of "professionals." I don't think that's what we need, what we need above all is shared insight. 

03:45:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN I want to just make… I'm sorry. 

03:45:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you… thank you. 

03:45:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) about the Hampshire Country School, you've gotta remember I was there in the 60s and this was a time where we're sort of everything was emotional disturbance. Yes, the school was treating kids with autism, but their actual brochure didn't say autism, that said for emotionally disturbed gifted students that's what the brochure actually said. I know looking back on it, there were kids there that had… that had… had autism and you've got to remember this is the era where they thought everything was emotional disturbance, you can look at history… 

03:46:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER I… I agree with that and also that was the phrased used in those days disturbed children. 

03:46:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah. 

03:46:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER It was the phrase used, you're right about that. 

03:46:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah. (inaudible) you see, their brochure didn't say any autism. 

03:46:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER Because they didn't know. 

03:46:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN They didn't know that that's… that's the problem. You see, none of the materials that are available now in autism were available then. 

03:46:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER No, but how extraordinary that Henry Patey built that school. It was one-on-one Temple that's what I think it was extraordinary. That he could guide you and he could guide me so that we work together… 

03:46:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN I wanna mention another thing about that school. When I first went there they had 26 students. It was absolutely wonderful, that was a living boarding school and I was there for like four… four years and when I left they had 80 students. And things got way too big and they couldn't control it and they've stayed in Massachusetts and put in their juvenile delinquents to the school and things really changed. Schools like that only work if they are small. I cannot emphasize that enough. 

03:47:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER I agree… I agree. And you know what I run into that in Los Angeles where somebody wanted there's a wonderful school the Baron School and… and Henry Baron, who had endowed it wanted to enlarge it and the head of the school came to me she said 'Please don't let him. We cannot do the work we're doing.' Just exactly what you're saying Temple until unless we stay small, it's back to one-on-one, it has to work that way. 

03:47:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) Mr. Carlock was science teacher there, he actually wasn't NASA… NASA space scientist that is true. One thing about the movie umm… the work stuff, you know, all the work cattle stuff that stuff was right, he wasn't NASA space scientist, he also was not an accredited teacher, he was just one of these creative people that, you know, how to motivate students and… and get them to work kind of mentors that we need to be finding (inaudible) and he was a very… very critical important mentor and I still kept seeing Mr. Carlock after I went to college Franklin Pierce. Mother and the Dean of Franklin Pierce got together and arrange me to go into this little small new college on probation and I did well there. I worked really hard there, but I'll still see to Mr. Carlock on weekends. See that helped to make a gradual transition from… from school to college and the same thing needs to be done with employment that was done with me, 13 you got me that little sewing job that you just arranged. You know, then I was doing the horse barns, painting signs, I was doing carpentry work, I worked in a research lab and so by the time I graduated I had a ton of work experience. 

03:48:50
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Kinda getting back to the question of the movie. How did your friends and family react to the movie again did it… did it… did it change, you think any of their feelings about either of you? 

03:49:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, basically (inaudible) made me get much busier. Umm… You know, that's the biggest thing that it… that it did. I get recognized in the airport all over the place. Umm… I've had people come to me and they say they've watched the movie and inspired them. These are people probably on the spectrum (inaudible) maybe kids are quirky and different and that inspired them to help them succeed. I think that's one of the most important things the movie did because one thing good about it, they are, you know, the way I talked that Claire Danes like sort of became me in the 60s. The way that was done is agave her all these all ancient tapes that I had back from the late 80s. All the stuff we could find and she went around planet it on ipod, so and… and worked with the coach and the visual thinking shown correctly. Umm… The sensory problems are shown correctly. You see and that's important in terms of just teaching people about autism and Nancy (inaudible) at the University of Pittsburgh was a consultant on that and she was meticulous about making sure that it was clinically accurate in terms of how it showed the… the autism. 

03:50:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER You know, I thought and I thought the actually the… the drawings they did of your mechanical work were quite wonderful. 

03:50:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well and so my real drawings were on there too. 

03:50:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yes, but what they were a great addition. 

03:50:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, and the drawing where they… they show a scene in there where I see all the different kinds of shoes that's exactly how I think. They showed me seeing the angle of the gate, as a gate opened and that's exactly how I think. That's a part of the movie I just love the most. 

03:50:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Did you ever… Temple, did you ever meet again any of the people that you knew before you were famous from the movie? 

03:50:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, yeah, Emily Gerson Saines is the producer of the movie. She's the mother of an autistic child and he's quite severe uh… and an acting agent in New York. And ten years ago, it is now like almost 15 years ago, (inaudible) the idea together about doing this movie and it took a long time to get the project off the ground because they couldn't get the right team to get. Can you imagine a marketing meeting we're trying to pitch an autistic slaughterhouse designer at a marketing meeting. And so they… they had a couple of other teams of people they didn't know what to do with the story. One of the first scripts had really horrible cows up in heaven in costumes, I mean, bad with these first scripts, really bad. And then they got Mick Jackson. And he's the director that did (inaudible) stories real visual thinker and really got it and he hired Claire. And when I first looked Claire up on the internet, I go 'You've gotta be joking. She's going to be made blonde, long hair.' And make it seen her do some kind of thing in New York where she imitated the Purple Lady in (inaudible). 

03:51:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER Andrew Wyeth … it's from Andrew Wyeth's painting. 

03:52:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Christina's World. 

03:52:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER Christina's World, yes. 

03:52:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN And he saw Claire imitate that and he says 'Claire is my lady.' And they stuffed her hair up under a wig and she became me. And Mick Jackson and I'll tell one of the little thing, Mick Jackson wanted to cut her hair off and dye it, not, and he didn't want to have wigs so they did the first four days of filming with a wig and (inaudible). 

03:52:20
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Did you… I… I may have got this an incorrect at some point but your… your roommate in… in college, did you meet up with… with her again after the movie came out? 

03:52:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Uh… I… This is one thing they did change in the movie. They moved her from graduate school to college. She… I had lost touch with her and she contacted me after the movie and she still… she's retired now. She'd worked for the State of California for years in kind of a clerical job and she's, you know, (inaudible) still playing the piano very much into music. 

03:53:00
R. WAYNE GILPIN Good, okay. Umm… When you were growing up, well, I'll say this to… to Eustacia first. We now know that the kind of foods we eat affect who we are? Did you… Were you very strict with your daughter about what she ate when she was growing up? 

03:53:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER No, but we were… we didn't ask children what they'd like to have to eat. 

03:53:30
[sil.] 

03:53:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER We buzz the children, the children did not buzz us. 

03:53:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's 50 (inaudible). 

03:53:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER This is what we have for dinner. It's here in front of you, if you don't want it, fine, wait for breakfast. And it wasn't just for Temple, it was for all children. And everybody else in the neighborhood did exactly the same thing. I always think of one of your brother's friends who came for dinner one night and he leaned over and he… he said to Dick 'What is this on this plate?' And Dick leaned back and he said 'It's broccoli.' And the little boy looked up at me and he said 'Oh, I'll eat it… I'll eat it. I just want to know what it is.' That's the way all the children were trained. 

03:54:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I had one thing where I was allowed to pick what I eat that was lunch on the weekends and that was a grilled cheese sandwich, open so it would puff up on top. And I've been allowed to I wouldn't eat nothing but grilled cheese sandwiches. But that was something that I could pick just on the weekends. I could have that. 

03:54:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER I want to add to that. Uh… Somebody asked me the other day. When… when your children were growing up, did you know anybody who was allergic to peanut butter? I don't think so. All children ate peanut butter… 

03:55:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN We played in the dirt when we were kids. 

03:55:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well… well, it was… 

03:55:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) allergies. 

03:55:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER It was peanut butter and jelly or peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff, it's what a lot of children ate including you. I don't remember you are allergic to peanuts. 

03:55:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I think you know there's a whole thing about kids (inaudible) in to playing, we (inaudible) dirt pile out in the backyard whenever a beach pales in the summer out in this dirt thing and… and the kids that work around farm animals don't have as many allergies. 

03:55:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER So I… I don't know where all of these mysterious little quirks arrive from, but some of it is controlled. 

03:55:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN And then so much serious because I have a good friend where… 

03:55:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible). 

03:55:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Serious got problems and serious problem with peanut allergies where a dog that had eaten peanut butter two hours before and looked at kids face and that all swelled up and turn into giant hives. 

03:56:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER I… I'm not denying that I'm saying part of it is fun and nor am I deny the tremendous connections between the brain and the gut, and we don't know what they are. But look at the way we talk, we say 'Well, my gut feeling is,' that means we already know our attitudes are coming from somewhere other than our head and look at the expressions I feel it in my bones, oh, my blood froze. We're aware that there are other connections denote the neurology in our head and I think that will emerge more fully in time but they haven't emerged yet. 

03:56:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Now Eustacia, you spoke earlier about being an acting and singing. 

03:56:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah. 

03:56:55
R. WAYNE GILPIN Do you think that there was outside interest helped you a lot in being able to manage your children? 

03:57:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER That had helped, I don't deny it. I had the privilege of being married to a man who had a great deal of money and at that time he was willing to spend it. So that when I worked in the theatre, after all I only worked at night in this theatre and I won't say this… We may have had primitive forms of lights, but we had an enormous effect on the theatre. We were the first theatre in this country to produce UNESCO. And The Boston Globe said 'Well, the poets they're just gone crazy.' UNESCO is now taught The Bald Soprano was the play. It's now taught in college courses. So we were way ahead of the game. And I did this it only worked at night because all of us work during the day. I had help there in the house that I couldn't leave the children with and you were pretty well by then had (inaudible). I didn't have that much sleep, but I was young and I could do without the sleep. 

03:58:10
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… This is directly relevant to Temple, 14-year-old daughter with Asperger syndrome seems to have no empathy for… for humans not Temple does, she does, but this child has no empathy for humans, but cares deeply (inaudible) and she was empathy for animals. How can that be? 

03:58:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, she really loves animals, but doesn't like humans. First of all, I would like to ask a more information. One of the things I (inaudible) the big problem is when I talked about that this morning people over generalize in what way is she showing lack of empathy to humans. What does she do I… I need to learn more about this. You know, people ask me things like what's the most important thing to do for autism? While the kid is three and not talking as hours and hours of early intervention ABA type of things… things like that. But as soon as that kid gets over, things are a whole lot more complicated. I can no longer answer what can you do for autism and this is something where I've got to know more about this child and what exactly do you mean by no empathy for humans. You see, that's very… very vague. What… How does she show that? I don't know. 

03:59:30
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… Temple, did you always feel a strong feeling for animals or did that come on later… 

03:59:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, my… my really relationship with animals really started when I got to the Hampshire Country School, they had horses there. I really got into riding, taking care of the horse barn and then when I was 15, I went to my aunt's ranch. Umm… You know, this brings back the whole thing by, you get interested in a thing, you know, we had a dog when I was a child and but I wasn't… I didn't, you know, it wasn't until I got the horse that I really got involved with, you know, with the animals and… and if I… and I had… We had a small dairy at my school too. At 12 I had of (inaudible) shorthorn, milking shorthorn… You know, you've gotta expose kids to things to get them interested and I get asked all the time of service stories. And when I found that some kids are the best (inaudible) it's the best thing you can do, other kids are little afraid of dogs in beginning, then they liked them and then the other kids are not appropriate because there may be a sensory issue… 

04:00:40
R. WAYNE GILPIN Uh… Temple, when you were growing up, were you close with your siblings, when you're during childhood and are you… are you basically friends now? 

04:00:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, we're definitely good friends now. You know, one of my siblings a year and a half younger and then the other two are a whole lot younger like five years younger so on, (inaudible) I used to call them the babies. And… and but they were things that my sister and I did together with other… other kids in the neighborhood. I haven't sleep outside building tree houses. We put… putting plays on together was one of the things that we did, you know, a lot of play, turn-taking game, there's a lot of things that we did together. 

04:01:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN You wanna add to that? 

04:01:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER I was just going to add to that. Children have their own culture and we… we don't talk enough about that, we don't notice it enough. And the thing that I remember Temple, was the tent in the backyard that went up for spending the night and the flashlights were collected from everybody's house. I don't know who's tent it was, but you said you told me who the girl was, who's tent it was… 

04:01:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, that's right. 

04:01:55
EUSTACIA CUTLER And you said she had the most money for the candy. So everybody pull their money and all got… Because it was a night about flashlights, and candy and telling stories to each other. 

04:02:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah. 

04:02:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER It was your own secret world and people said… said to me afterwards probably, my mother 'Well, what happened to them during the night.' I said 'I don't have any idea.' They were all then find the next morning. 

04:02:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Tired out. We didn't getting any sleep and the other thing is kids don't get the opportunity today do these kind of things (inaudible) they are so overly scheduled, you know, because we did a lot of planning for that sleep out. You know, we had to decide, you know, what kind of candy we gonna to buy, potato chip, grape soda, huge gigantic planning meetings, expeditions down grocery store buy all these snacks. And… and those are important things kids to work together and do. When kids, a lot of kids today are so overly schedule or they're doing so much online stuff, they're not doing those things where they do that negotiation with the other kids. 

04:03:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER But what about who put up the tent? This was not a simple tent. 

04:03:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN We did… we did. We put it up. 

04:03:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, you did. 

04:03:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible) would help with that. We put it up. It was me and (inaudible). We put the tent. 

04:03:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER You all put it up. 

04:03:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN We did ourselves, the old army tent, ancient old big army tent that we put up. We get it ourselves. No, (inaudible) that it was put up right, but you know… 

04:03:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER But you survived the night. 

04:03:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN They kinda sag like this in the middle. 

04:03:35
R. WAYNE GILPIN Temple, in terms of being… being a visual thinker. How do you think that relates to feelings and emotions, (inaudible) related it all? 

04:03:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, I think visual thinking really helped me in my work with animals. Because animals don't have words, so they're gonna store their memories as pictures, as sounds, very… very specific smell. I mean, think about what the dog learns when he checked out the local tree. He knows who's been there, how long were they will there, their friend or their foe, there's a lot of things that the dog learns, he only goes the local tree, animals can get fear memory. This is involved with animal emotion. A dog will tend to associate something he was either hearing or seeing right at the moment that something bad happened. And in my book Animals in Translation, I talk about a horse that was scared, that the black hats. Because during a veteran eye procedure, someone had (inaudible) on his face and the guy was wearing a black cowboy hat, white cowboy hat was fine, black hat was bad. Or maybe the animal that was afraid of diesel powered equipment, it that ran with diesel it was bad and if it ran with gas then it was good, they'll make the sensory based associations. And so being a visual thinker it did help me and in Animals in Translation, I talk about that because I think that's more closer to how animals actually think. 

04:04:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, let me add to that. I… I think also that we're a visual (inaudible) your sister is a splendid artist, uh… acting is all out of recollection of how other people… how you watched other people behave. Writing is all visual. You see the differences instead of doing it with your body, you're doing it with on a computer. Uh… Visual thinking has different forms, you're talking about an animal form. I just wanted to elaborate a little further on the fact that there are… We as a family, we work visually (inaudible) that makes sense to you. 

04:05:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, that makes sense. Yes, it does. And that was shocking to me when I found out there are some people in the world that do not think visually. But it was a long time ago I asked speech therapist one time to think about a church steeple and she got this very vague pointy thing, where I see specific… specific churches. But people that aren't visual thinkers, might just see something like that a very vague representational image. And I'm going 'Oh, wow! There really different kinds of minds.' 

04:06:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, we would see that that's like a… a well-known writer. I think it was Archibald MacLeish, who said 'The truth is always specific' and he meant that about all writers, you cannot generalize. It doesn't make a good story. 

04:06:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN For… for Eustacia, you grew up in the world of… world of Harvard. (inaudible) your English lit major is that correct. Your daughter obviously didn't take that path. Did that bother you at all? Did you try to move her away from the… the world of cattle and science? 

04:06:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER No, I wanted her to be free, to be what she wanted to be. I wanted to be who I want to be, not who somebody else wanted me to be. I wanted her to… I think there's a great confusion right there about what do we mean when we say normal. The… the idea that we go to cure autism? No, I don't think so. This is a quality of life that takes a challenge as I've said before of how people present themselves to the world. But identity which lies at the bottom what you're asking there is who it is we think we are? Who do we want to be and I wanted I knew what I was trying to be and I wanted you and your siblings to be who they wanted to be, as they saw it, not as I saw it. 

04:07:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Uh… Temple, you covered this briefly before but how did you make the… the transition from respond to teasing by hitting to crying. How did you make that change? 

04:07:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN It just sort of happened and I don't realize that (inaudible). I got in a gigantic fistfight in Hampshire Country School after being called names in the… in the dining room and I horseback riding was taken away for two weeks. I was still allowed to clean the stalls around the barn, but I couldn't ride them. And that's why I switched from anger to crying. It happened almost didn't kind of realize that it happened, I just switched emotions. And for all things I can't keep a job, might end up in jail, crying, you know, lose your job. 

04:08:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, let me add to it. You see, the two are connected. We use the words tears of rage, they are connected. You are able to come… come at your anger from a different point of view that was very creative. 

04:08:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, that's what I did because I got rid of the angry, you know, fists and things like that. 

04:09:00
R. WAYNE GILPIN Uh… For Eustacia, did… did Temple had problems with responding by hitting. Did they come back to you? Did they… did the school call you about that problem? 

04:09:10
EUSTACIA CUTLER I'm not picking up on what you're saying? What? 

04:09:15
R. WAYNE GILPIN Temple had the problem of responding to teasing by… by hitting. Did… did… did… did… did the teachers from school call you and say 'We have this problem?' 

04:09:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh, though this is when she was a teenager? 

04:09:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN Right, yes. 

04:09:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh, it was brutal. Oh! Well, for one thing adolescence is difficult for all children. You know, they've lived through their life thus far, they've learned how to behave and what's expected of them, now all of a sudden Mother Nature changes all of them says 'Throw away the rule book. You're gonna have a new body, new sensations, new clothes, new friends, new patterns of behavior and strange new feelings.' And I think… I… I remember Temple, you're not wanting to leave off your little girl clothes and you weren't nearly as tall as I am by then. And I said 'You're too old to where your little girl clothes.' And one day, you caught sight of yourself in the mirror and these were real tears, not tears of rage, you suddenly saw yourself that you were too big to be wearing a little girl clothes and you said 'I don't want to grow up.' Well, Mother Nature's there at work, you're going to grow. So here she was now in a girl school I don't think I would choose that now an all girls school. But the reason I'm going into that is every little girl there is struggling with the same thing, she too is trying to grow up. She too has a whole new set of clothes to wear and new patterns to try to follow. Well, Temple, the friendships you'd had before, back when you were making tents and riding bikes altogether and those wonderful kites you made, that wasn't going to happen anymore. And so you try to reach out to these girls as a way to make friends to joke with them because we were a family of jokers. You took all their clothes and mix them up into different lockers. Well, that's sort of funny in a way. It's not funny to a little girl of 14 whose brand new clothes and who's new image of herself means everything. So it didn't make friends, it just began to stir up trouble and what? I will get angry telling this story all over again. Because what (inaudible) is where the hell was the school. Why do they… If you're raising teenage little girls why do not know this is the simple fact of life and not see that there's going to be trouble in this situation and then I think one day you… you locked one of the girls in the broom closet. Well, (inaudible) things why… why was nobody in this school understanding that and say 'I think we've got something brewing here and we better look at it and talk about it and figure out a better step.' One day, Temple, you were… This is the way you told me, you… you said you were walking down the corridor and this girl passed you and hissed 'Retard!' And you turned around which I would have done too and hit her with a book. And the little girl went home and told her mother… 

04:12:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN I threw her across the music room. 

04:12:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh! Well! The little girl told her mother, the mother called the headmaster of the school, and the headmaster of the school called our house. Now your age 14, children like to answer the telephone. So naturally you answered it. And he instead of saying 'Hello, Temple, may I speak to your mother?' He said over the telephone to you 'You are a menace to society. Don't come back up after Christmas vacation. I think that's much more damaging than a thrown book. And as you said when you staggered back from the telephone. He didn't ask to hear my side of what happened. So that's when fortunately I had been doing I think I mentioned this… this morning. Doing this journalistic work for… for WGBH in Boston and I'd visited all these special schools that's how I knew about Hampshire school. And I'd visit them as a journalist where I didn't tell them about you because I knew they change what they were going to say to me about their school or they change what I saw in that school. So I was able to come to the conclusion of those three different schools and I wanted you to have a choice in your destiny, you could pick the school you wanted to go to, and you pick Hampshire School. But that's essentially what happened. 

04:14:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN Yeah. 

04:14:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER And I do not wish them well. 

04:14:35
R. WAYNE GILPIN I will… I will call them and tell them that. Uh… Temple, you may have said this in your presentation, but what made your 20s so hard? 

04:14:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN One of the worst things in my 20s was the panic attacks worsened and got worse. And I think this is biology. I don't think this was psychology. I think it's a biological thing going on here because I've seen others people who are really in good jobs and stuff worsen (inaudible) even in some of our colleagues have had in… in design… industrial design umm… get into problems, drugs and alcohol. This is where the right medication can help. Now of course the other big thing was a woman in a man's field that was not easy. And this is where autistic fixation might have helped me some because somebody else that was less determined would have what? 

04:15:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER It also gave you a little Teflon surface. 

04:15:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, I mean, it's the other thing is I didn't pick up subtle social cues. So I've went into the feed yard and the cowboys are rolling their eyes, that they didn't like me being there, I didn't notice that. Now the scene in the movie where they kicked me out (inaudible) the cowboys' wives wouldn't like it, that actually happened, that's true. And the bull testicles on the vehicle, is true. 

04:15:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thus true. 

04:15:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Those things are true. And… and but the subtle social things, I didn't pick up on. You know, maybe helping me bust into the field that might have almost been in advance. I've talked to other people that, you know, breaking into the industry, you know, my generation that had similar stories to tell. And also the other thing is what people call sexual harassment today is nothing compared to what I went through. You have to learn how to become a member of the little boys club. 

04:16:25
R. WAYNE GILPIN Umm… You want to add to Eustacia at all. 

04:16:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER This was obviously I wasn't there, Temple was grown up by this time. 

04:16:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN I was in Arizona and you were in Buckeye. 

04:16:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER That was Buckeye. But that is… that is a form of sexual harassment and that's what the Women's Lib was all about. Bless you, you… you fought it and you stood up against them and I don't really know why men feel threatened by women. Are we really so difficult, so mysterious that we want to work, what we think we're good at, it seems to me like a simple target. 

04:17:05
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay, this is for either of you. What is the single most powerful thing an educator can do to impact the life of an individual with autism? 

04:17:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN First of all, lets to general, let's just start out with if the kid is two or three (inaudible) autistic symptoms, it's the early intervention. I think everybody's going to agree on that, you know, that you gotta get this kid into a lot of hours of one-on-one early intervention, some of the experts would fight over exactly which program they're going to use. But once you get pass that, you know, when these kids kinda diverge and, you know, they all look bad when they're young into a fully verbal group, some that are going to stay with more severe problems, you know, then I've got to have a lot more information. Once I get pass that first, you know, early childhood, very… very early childhood phase. 

04:17:55
R. WAYNE GILPIN You want to add to that, Eustacia? 

04:18:00
EUSTACIA CUTLER I… I agree, I… I think there's such diversity uh… and there's such diversity in different ages that children are at different needs and you have to just care about each child. 

04:18:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN When you gotta get more information tool is what kind of problem, the first thing I ask is age and if they say 'Free, no speech I get a standard thing I tell them.' Once I get (inaudible) I got a whole speech have you got, what's going on in school, uh… you know, then maybe it's a teenager, then I'll talk about work skills, social stuff and it… it's (inaudible). As I've said before in talks, the normal mind over generalizes when they're trying to solve problems. And I find that as an autism, it… it happens in troubleshooting behavior problems with dogs and horses. And it happens in troubleshooting problems with equipment even. I find people aren't good at categorizing. Let's take an autism for example, we got a non-verbal person with autism and the behavior has gone bad, is it biology like a hidden painful medical problem, like acid reflux or is it behavior. Maybe it's censoring, that's also biological. Uh… You know, there's a some new electronic device around us making a sound that hurts ears and other people don't realize it. 

04:19:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, I think a lot of these problems are true in other businesses. Your brother, who's the top bankers in New York has run into exactly the same problems among other bankers. They don't want to take responsibility for looking actively at the scene and as you say specifically what's happening and… 

04:19:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I don't want to find out the details… 

04:19:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER They won't… they won't take responsibility. 

04:19:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, they also won't get into the detail. So what my brother does is when the banking works for buys another bank, they got to merge the computer systems, and they have different numbering systems for the account and I've talked to my brother and he said 'They'll say well, Richard, why do you have to get into that level of detail about how the accounts are numbered.' Because if you don't get into that when you merge the computer systems, it's not going to work and the other sits upstairs are getting so abstract they don't understand that. 

04:20:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER They're not getting abstract, they're stepping aside, that's something very different. 

04:20:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, there are two things here, responsibility, but the other thing is that I've seen this happen in engineering stuff uh… where they just get too abstract. You know, when you have top-down thinker you can't exceed working memory and… 

04:20:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, again probably each of those problems… 

04:20:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN I think it's (inaudible). 

04:20:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Its individual, but there is again back to the fact that we're in a society where people do not want to take responsibility, they want to be given a job and they make some comfortable with their life. And there are going to be moments where you're going to have to make a choice and maybe it won't work, maybe it will work. Again, I… I go back to his problems with banking, the… What the… the head people will do is to face 'Okay, (inaudible) it'll take six months to do that.' No we want it done in six weeks, it can't be done. He said 'You end up shrugging their shoulders.' Because you know it can't be done. 

04:21:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible). 

04:21:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER And the result is a lot of the banking is in a very serious mess. Note that we should be talking about banking. 

04:21:35
R. WAYNE GILPIN Uh… Temple, what is your opinion on teaching children with autism or high-functioning autism (inaudible) autism, how to self advocate and advocate for others? 

04:21:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I think there's too much people on the high-end of the spectrum (inaudible) hung up on their autism. You know, the term self advocate cannot, you know, apply to a lot of different things. Uh… When I was in college and I had trouble with math, I went to the math teacher and he ended up tutoring me during office hours. And something that I call it self advocating, I call it getting tutoring. Now I didn't go in there and say that 'Well, Mr. Dyane, I have autism and that's why I need help with math.' I just say that Mr. Dyane that I needed help in math, you know, it's a, you know, you get into the whole accommodations thing. You know, there's too much where I think people… a lot of people on the high-end of spectrum are getting too much into autism's becoming their whole being in life. Now people ask me all the time I could snap my fingers and not the autistic. I… I don't want to change, you know, like the logical way I think. And on the other hand, career and being a college professor that comes first. I don't think the autism ought to become the first thing and there so hung up in all… in all of this stuff. And… and so we'll go to the counseling office at schools there on my right is this. You know, let's just figure out 'Okay, somebody might need extra time on tests' or you know, a quiet dorm (inaudible) they, you know, I can tell you it gets stuck in a triple that girl and the girl's dorm I went to college that (inaudible) afford triple room. I finally got put into double and that didn't work. But you've got, you know, there's different kinds of advocacy and I think some people wanna make autism advocacy their whole career. You know, this… Well, I don't know I had no, mother didn't help me get tutoring from Mr. Dyane. I actually did that myself. And I didn't let myself want the course. I went and got the tutoring before I got bad grade. 

04:23:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER But you see it started much younger. The… the clinic where everybody went to… The medical clinic where everybody went to get their teeth cleaned. I didn't go with you and your sister spoke (inaudible) the other day she said 'We liked it, you just said (inaudible) you do to go to the dentist at such and such an hour.' She said 'As a result, we had our individual relationship with the doctor or the dentist, we'd been told to go and see.' You were not there running interference for us. 

04:24:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN I rode my bike there… I rode my bike there and then you get a little animal charm, you know, (inaudible) each time and then (inaudible) and I would collect those and then compare them, but I know I had to ride my bike down to the dentist to get there myself. 

04:24:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, that's right and there was something healthier about it, something more responsible more grown-up, right. 

04:24:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN So it just made sense, (inaudible) want to start having trouble with math, I want the math teacher and… 

04:24:45
EUSTACIA CUTLER Part of that whole picture… 

04:24:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's right. 

04:24:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER If we're always going to run interference for our children how are they going to grow up? 

04:24:55
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, they gets down to basic stuff like shaking hand and shopping. I mean, by the time I was seven, I can go into (inaudible) the news stand buy a comic, I knew I could not sit read them at the news stand because it's not library. You know, and… and order food in restaurant, you taught me to look down the right hand side. Then if the host orders hamburger, you don't order stake. I mean, these were things that I learned very early on in my life and I think even normal kids today are getting to show or they are learning how to do these things. 

04:25:25
EUSTACIA CUTLER That's right. 

04:25:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN That's a really good point about why do I (inaudible) to the dentist. I was young when I did that. (inaudible). 

04:25:35
EUSTACIA CUTLER I… I love you did that. 

04:25:40
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay, for you Eustacia, if you're raising Temple today, would you keep her out of public schools why or why not? 

04:25:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Uh… Well, of course she was privately educated from the age of two through her Ph. D. as I said before. And I suspect I would still go for private education. I wish it weren't so but money helps. 

04:26:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN I wanna make a comment. I actually at University of Illinois State College… 

04:26:10
R. WAYNE GILPIN That's right. 

04:26:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, but you had to pay to (inaudible). 

04:26:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yeah, I get, you know, I get… 

04:26:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER That's because it and (inaudible) thus I think of Catherine Lord. There's a wonderful article that came up very… a… a couple of Sundays ago. I don't know if any of you saw it about the… the two boys who are cured of autism. Well, when you get through reading the article, you realize that a little bit questionable and Dr. Catherine Lord, who's one of the top authorities in this country on autism. I noticed she skipped right away from those words she said 'Well, the best possible result,' was the way she termed it. Uh… What she and the woman she was working with found in the pattern of the children who improved the most, who learned to handle themselves in the world the most, were three things pretty good IQ, she said above 70 that will be at a very young age when there was still not verbal perhaps. Good muscle tone, a lot of these children, particularly the boys have low muscle tone and money, regretfully, money works. 

04:27:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, I want to make a comment. I think that's probably especially true when the child that's got a lot of problems when they're young. But I come out of the construction industry, meat industry and I know a lot of Asperger types that came straight out of the trailer park, right into welding class and now they own metal fabrication companies. And these are the kids where there's no speech delay, went to public school and they still had all the hands on skilled trades classes and things like that and that's the route that they went. 

04:28:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Okay, but you're also talking about they… they did not go to a college, they went to a technical school, right? 

04:28:15
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, this guy didn't even graduate my (inaudible). 

04:28:15
EUSTACIA CUTLER We are… we are urging a lot of these children to push through college and I don't know exactly where it's going to take them. 

04:28:20
TEMPLE GRANDIN No, these guys graduated from my school runs the shop in (inaudible) probably but the one of the top ten biggest plants in the world. 

04:28:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER But they had a technical training. 

04:28:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yep, that's right. They had technical training that's right. 

04:28:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Why are we not looking at now for a lot of these kids who might also be happier with the technical training? 

04:28:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN It's not for everybody. (inaudible) maybe 25%. 

04:28:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER I don't say… I don't say that it is, but I'm also saying 'I'm not sure that college is for everybody, for every young person on the spectrum.' 

04:28:50
TEMPLE GRANDIN I agree with that… I agree with that. The other thing on the public versus private. So much depends with schools particular situation, particular place, you know, I have one parent where the kid is doing just great in the local public school and other one there doing horrible and another one over there where they're in the private school, it's awful. I have a really good friend, her kid was going a very good at private school the… the teacher hated their kid, it was just really bad. Uh… And then you go over another town, things are bad so much I think in a lot of things depends on the particular situation and the particular people that's what I'm seeing is that the people on the (inaudible) end of the spectrum on my generation in some ways did better, yet in that 50s upbringing getting those table manners, (inaudible) and those basic skills (inaudible). 

04:29:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER Well, but I also see in the difference in schools is where you've got a community of professional people, you have a top PTA and they push for the education of their children. When we moved to Bronxville, which is in Westchester about half an hour outside of New York City, Bronxville High School was tops, it was a public school and… and your three siblings all went there. Now Bronxville levied a school tax on everybody who lived there, so they had a little extra fun as a result and they were taught, they were able to get their kids into top colleges. Now I see where your brother has raised his boys in New Canaan, again you've got a lot of professional people living there who form a tight PTA and insist upon certain standards in the school. So it circles back to us… 

04:30:35
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible). 

04:30:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER (inaudible) not us and them, I keep saying this… this is just us and us. 

04:30:45
TEMPLE GRANDIN I want to make a comment. I'm seeing too many kids that actually get to college maybe they could get a degree in something like history and they never had any work experience and they're not able to get and hold a job, that's, you know, they actually make it through the college it's fine, you know, they… they really like structure of… of college and another bad thing that happened, when I went to Arizona State University that's a state school in the 70s, the tuition was maybe $500 a semester. Now you're look at it $5,000 a semester in the state colleges. You see, this is another bad things the state schools were not (inaudible) they used to be cheap to go to. 

04:31:30
EUSTACIA CUTLER Yeah, but this is the whole problem today. 

04:31:30
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, I know.

EUSTACIA CUTLER There were young people graduating with debts of $50,000 before they even get a job. And I don't know how they got to climb out of it. 

04:31:40
TEMPLE GRANDIN Well, it's not gonna work. 

04:31:40
EUSTACIA CUTLER But that's… that's a whole other story. 

04:31:45
R. WAYNE GILPIN Okay, speaking of other stories it's a great segway. As everyone in the room knows I hope if you don't you weren't reading any literature. Today happens to be the day that this lady gave birth to that lady, and we thank you very much for that. 

04:32:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER I'm so proud (inaudible). I'm so glad (inaudible). 

04:32:10
R. WAYNE GILPIN And as part of that we're going to ask you to join us in singing happy birthday to Temple Grandin. And Brad who seen in… in a bookstore has offered to lead us. He didn't know he was offered but he did and saying Happy Birthday to Temple Grandin. Ready. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Temple. Happy birthday to you. All right. 

04:33:00
TEMPLE GRANDIN (inaudible). 

04:33:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

04:33:05
TEMPLE GRANDIN Oh, thank you. 

04:33:05
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh, my goodness! 

04:33:10
TEMPLE GRANDIN Now I will see what I've got here. (inaudible) Western shirt, great! Oh, yeah! Oh, wonderful! Great! That's great! 

04:33:20
EUSTACIA CUTLER Oh, that's beautiful. 

04:33:25
TEMPLE GRANDIN Yes. Well, I'll certainly wear that. 

04:33:30
R. WAYNE GILPIN Well, I wanna conclude this session by saying that I… I've enjoyed it very… very much. If you enjoy it as much as I did, you enjoyed it a lot. Umm… So Temple! Eustacia! Thank you for your time, thank you for your insights, thank you for your thoughts. I appreciate it very much. 

04:33:50
EUSTACIA CUTLER Thank you. 

04:33:55

04:34:05
R. WAYNE GILPIN Join me in welcoming uh… coauthor of this beautiful book Early Intervention in Autism. It's… it's not titled very well if the book really covers everything about behavior and dealing with kids from… from 2 to probably… probably 20. Great book, great guy, join me in welcoming Dr. Jim Ball. Jim! 

04:34:30
JIM BALL Thank you, Wayne. 

04:34:35
Jim Ball 

04:34:35
JIM BALL I always try to think what did I do in the past life to Wayne to be on Friday afternoon at three o'clock after Temple and her mother but uh… we figure that out. And you guys are the diehard so I appreciate you being here. Uh… I move around a lot so normally I would be down there talking with you, but I have to stay up here because they're videotaping which is fine uh… just hope we don't fall off because I tend to lose myself. Umm… And I was born and raised in New Jersey. I only moved maybe ten miles South of where I grew up so I only know New Jersey and please don't go by our reality TV shows of what New Jersey is like if you've never been there. Umm… You know, if you've seen The Sopranos, right. Uh… Cake Boss, they're a little true about those areas of North Jersey and there is… there I mean New Jersey is a small state and there is a dividing line. I mean, you hit 295 which is in the middle of our state. You go South that's a different New Jersey than North Jersey. North Jersey, anybody here ever watched the Housewives of New Jersey. They're in the news now I think again for the lawsuits and everything. Umm… But I married a Jersey girl, my wife is like none of those women. So umm… and then if you look at the Jersey Shore, right? So anybody here ever been to the Jersey Shore? I mean, the Jersey Shore is beautiful. I mean, we have a beautiful shoreline. Umm… But those people on Jersey Shore are all from Staten Island. They're New Yorkers. They invade our beaches. So we don't take credit for them either. And I think the worst show is called Jerseylicious, anybody seen that one? That's horrible. But there is one place worse with… with reality shows and I always go there. I go to Lafayette, Louisiana a lot. And I always like to say swamp people, so that's all I have to say. Umm… What I want to do in the next hour and a half is share with you practical ideas that I have accumulated in my career. My book is up here because even though like Wayne said it doesn't have early intervention, really doesn't talk to what the book is about. The book is really about my 30-year career and only working with those individuals on an… on the autism spectrum. I work with kids right now, my youngest is about 28 months and my oldest is 65, and all the things that are in the book, I use with all of those individuals. And there are a variety and range of ability levels, so I've got kids that are in college right now that I've had since they were three or four. And I have kids that are in the work world that I've had since they were, you know, three or four. I have kids that are going on to college and I had kids that were still pretty significantly challenged and live in a variety of different settings. So the book really talks about behavior umm… even though it has early intervention because the first two chapters are on early intervention. And where are my OCD people? Anybody a little obsessive compulsive? Only four of you. I'm sure there's a lot of (inaudible) if you're a little OCD I apologize for two things. One is that the background on my slides are gonna be different than yours so don't freak out. And second, my first two slides are not in your packet, so don't get freaked out by that either, don't go frantically looking, like you've something's wrong or run out to Wayne and say I don't have this. Umm… Because I… I like to share and the reason they're not in there is because I update them consistently. Because I'd like to share the latest resources that I go to when I'm working with kids because I don't like the word expert, I mean, if you work with the kid on the spectrum, every kid is uniquely different and each one of them teach you something different every time you touch their lives. Umm… And most of my career has been around working with the individuals, but also establishing friendships and, you know, a couple of my best friends are individuals on the spectrum. Uh… And what I love about them is that they are probably the most comfortable people in their own skin that I've ever seen. They are extremely happy with who they are and they will share that with you. Uh… And there's one that I just wanna share a quick story with. He was a young man that I met many… many years ago and back then they called them behaviorally disordered, so he was a behaviorally disordered kid umm… and when we were working on at the time was the behavior was severe face-biting. So when he got frustrated, out of control or anxious, he would lunge at you and bite you in the face. Uh… And when I became involved with him, he had taken off a nose and some cheeks and, I mean, in variety of just that frustration and anxiety and that 0 to 60 like that, not no triggers, not no… no being able to figure it out. He then went on went to college, got his doctorate, he was a rocket scientist that was his job for awhile. Umm… Later on years after we find out he's got Asperger's because I'm going back to the 80s. Anybody remember the 80s here? Anybody remember life without cell phones? It's interesting my… my oldest now who's 31 umm… when he moved into his new house I'm like' Okay, what's your phone number and he looks at me like what this strange look and I'm like 'Your phone number.' He goes 'You have my phone number.' I'm like 'That's your cell phone.' I'm thinking he had a landline, right? And he's looking at me like… That… that really hit me hard umm… that, you know, but I went back with this young man and it's funny because he taught me so much about not assuming anything with this population. Because I think when we assume with these kids and these adults that we truly don't make that difference in their lives. Because a lot of times I will hear from educators, parents, 'If he can do this, why can't he do that?' And it's not simple logic for a lot of our individuals and you heard Temple talk about silos and I always love coming on after Temple because she just gives… gives you so many great examples of the things that I talk about. They… they… they… they practice their lives in silos and it's our job to connect those silos. Umm… But this particular individual, you know, after years really talked about how the difference in his life was mainly around learning the social skills in order to be successful because let's face it. As they grow up, the one thing that's really going to touch their quality of life are going to be their social skills. And that's the area of impact that we have to have the greatest degree of success with. Umm… And… and that's got to start at the early ages. And anybody here worked with the little ones? If you work with the little ones, the best thing you can be doing is teaching social skills and… and picking a curriculum. There are a lot of curriculums out there, but pick a curriculum and stick with it and work with it with those individuals. Because that's going to really, besides toilet training, that's really going to impact their lives the most and that's really going to be a quality of life indicator for them. But with this young man and it's funny because every year we get together to have dinner and our… my schedule is such where years ago it used to be on the same day, in the same place, at the same time, in the same table, and he would request it try to request it a year in advance and he just, you know, the ladies like we don't take reservations that far in advance. You know, and I would walk in and I'd always wait to a minute after seven because we'd always meet at seven o'clock and I'd wait till a minute after, just to mess with them a little, right. And I'd walk in and I'd say 'Hey, Pet, how are you? And he goes 'You're late! You're late! And I'm like 'Well, I'm just trying to loosen you up a little. He goes 'I'm loose and you're late.' So we'd sit down and, you know, how he start that awkward banter with somebody when you first start talking when you haven't seen him for a while and then after like two or three minutes you're right back where you left off. We would start that awkward banter the same way every single time. He would go 'So Jim how is your wife, Nancy Ball, born on March 13th, 1958.' And we'd go over all my kids and their birthdays and then I always look at him and I'd be like 'Hey, Pet, how's your love life?' And he look at me and his head would go down and he'd go 'Jim, if I told you once, I've told you a thousand times, they smell really good, but they touch your stuff.' I kinda get that. I get that myself. Umm… But those are the experiences because… because I was taught early and I'm so glad I was taught. One of my mentors came to me and said 'Listen, Jim, if you're really going to make an impact with these individuals, it's not about a nine to five job, it's not about click, you know, check-in in, in the morning and leave and at the end of the day. It's about a lifestyle.' Umm… And I can truly say that in the 30 years that I've been doing this umm… it has become a lifestyle and I've incorporated so many good relationships and friends, and I'm a different person today because of people like Temple. I mean, I've known Temple forever. And I'm a different person today for knowing her and she's made me a better person. Umm… And it was interesting because we were talking and when I get to my strategies I'm gonna wait and I… I'm going to tell you about one of the stories with Temple, but the impact is just so evident over time. Because how many people here have seen Temple several times talk? All right, how many have seen her years ago? All right, and then today, right. Is she different today than she was years ago? She's much different… she's much different. And I'm gonna talk about the why is to that in a little bit. What I'd like to share with you is resources. Umm… And the first one up there is the Autism Society that www. now I don't know why it basicity.org. It's supposed to say dash society.org. I apologize for that typo. Umm… But the Autism Society has a great website, a lot of great information but what I like about it is there's something in it called Autism source. And autism source allows you to put in your zip code and then some parameters, you know, Medicaid friendly dentist. And it will pull up a database that we have that we'll give you all of those people that are in that area. Autism friendly haircuts, it'll pull up all those people. Umm… You know, autism friendly bowling alley. And if people have come to us and given us that information, we don't vet it and then go out and like put the autism societies seal of approval on it. But we take the information and then people can write comments on it, if they've used the activity. I really liked that for… for us. And the Autism Society also has 106 affiliates throughout the country and you have a couple of very good ones here in Tennessee. So if you're looking for resources locally, I would reach out to your local affiliate here in umm… in the area. And we actually umm… years ago had one of our Autism Society annual meetings and conference here. I forget the date but it was years ago. Anybody go to that conference, anybody hear that conference because we were here in Nashville as I remember. The next one is Autism Asperger's Digest and that comes actually published by Future Horizons. Uh… But the reason I like it is it is a very easily read magazine. Has anybody here ever seen the… the digest? Okay, couple of you, right. There on the table, I would… I would really strongly suggest you look at them, umm… you can get a two pager and you name the issue. It could be behavior, it could be sexuality, it could be social skills, it could be employment, it could be living in… in the community, you name it, it's in there and it's two pages worth of really good practical information. It's not going to talk to you about the theory, it's gonna give you a five or six things that you can like read it in the morning and go into your classroom, or work with your kid or, you know, whatever it touches your life with autism, you can apply those things immediately. There easily read umm… and they're practical, and that's why I like them. The next one is Future Horizons. You saw their books here, they've got even more books in their catalog. Uh… And they're my go-to place. So if there's anything that I want to look up or there's anything I wanted to do with autism, I go to their site to see what books they have. And one of my favorite books which I think probably is Obsolete as soon as it came out. But one of my favorite books by them is their iPad app book, which really, you know, just takes all the different organizational skills, academic skills, scheduling skills and then breaks them down and then gives you all those apps that are out there because there are so many of them out there. Umm… And then the last one is my website. And is anybody here work or have children that are significantly challenged on the spectrum, right. If you have significantly challenged kids, I wrote an article for the Digest Magazine probably five or six years ago and it's on my website for free, so you can just pull it up and print it. Umm… And it talks about rethinking, how we teach the more severe child on the spectrum. Because I go around to a lot of classrooms and work with a lot of kids who are significantly challenged, and I see us doing the same things over and… over and… over again a lot of matching skills, a lot of sorting skills. Those repetitive skills that the kids liked to do, but they're not real functional. And I think you heard a lot today from Temple and her mother, you know, Eustacia really about the functionality of why you do things. Because I challenge every single person in here who works with a child on the spectrum and/or has a child on the spectrum to think did you ever when you were in school have a class that you either ask your parent, your teacher or thought to yourself, how is this ever going to affect my life? Did you ever have that class? Okay, you should think for that child on the spectrum when you're teaching something, how is this affect their lives? How is this going to make their lives better? The fact that they can wrote count from one to a billion, is that gonna really impact their lives? I don't know. I'm not too sure. Unless you… they had… there's a job out there to write count that'd be great. But the one-to-one correspondence skill is the better skill. So if there's a bunch of marbles out there and you say give me five and the kid can consistently bang out the different numbers, that's the skill we want, the fact that they can say every color. I go into kindergarten classes and I walk in and there's my kid on the spectrum in a class of neurotypical peers 22, 23 of them, and my kid is banging out all the colors. And the other ones are struggling with the basics and mine is talking about Chartreuse, aqua marine, you know, and everybody else is barely getting yellow and green. Or they're doing their shapes and my kid is talking about rhombus and pentagon and dodecagons, right. And the other kids are struggling with circle, square and triangle. But again what's the functionality to that because in the colors, can he go and go into the closet and get five yellow forks, four blue spoons and three red cups. Then, it makes sense. Then it has meaning. So really looking at what that meaning looks like and that's what that article really… really does. How many people here use video modeling with your kids? Because if you're not using video modeling I'm going to be the biggest advocate here today for you to go out and do video modeling. Because video modeling is by far one of the best ways to teach almost anything to a child on the spectrum and it doesn't matter where they fall on the spectrum. Model Me Kids is a very good umm… website that has all kinds of social skills for teaching kids on the spectrum, there already pre-made, there're the little avatars and they… they show you things. You know, our kids also loved to go into those virtual worlds and do their little social skills stuff in there with all those little (inaudible) and stuff that's great stuff too, but you can make your own, you don't have to go out and commercially buy this stuff. How many people here have an iPhone? And if you will have an iPad? I mean, you can take videos like that and I can tell you story after story of teaching thing after thing to kids who have struggled in video modeling. I did this talk two months ago in Buffalo, New York and there was a grandmother, who couldn't get her grandson, who she was now the guardian of to toilet and he was three, three and a half, and she was struggling with it and she didn't talk to me at all afterwards. But I got an email just recently where she said 'Jim, I tried that video modeling thing and she goes and it works, it works.' I was just in a class in Lafayette, Louisiana and I walked in and it was a little guy uh… four and a half year-old and when I walked in his hair was almost in the middle of his back and as I got closer, I thought he was a girl at first because his hair was long. And am I got closer, I figured out it was a boy and when I got like top of him there was like crusties in his hair and like food particles, and I talked to the teacher and they're like 'You know, what they'd been trying for a year. I mean, he is so sensitive with his head as soon as you want to do anything with his head, he will freak out. He will have these meltdowns that are violent. And they said the father and his two brothers took him to the… the barbershop to have his haircut, and the three of them couldn't hold this four-year-old down to get his hair cut or even like wash it. And they had tried all the desensitization techniques. They had tried like letting them hold the clippers and let them hear the clippers, and then let them put it on his head for, we tried all of them, none of them worked. So I said 'Well, what I want you to do for the next couple of days is find every happy hair cutting thing you can online.' And how many people here access YouTube. If you can access YouTube, you can find almost anything. And one of my favorite things to do especially with my older kids is how many people here have ever seen The Big Bang Theory? There is a Sheldon. Example for every single thing on the autism spectrum and you can always find one. But this young man we just show on a smart board, I said just loop it and let it run all day don't… don't… don't tell him to watch it, don't make him watch it, don't direct him to watch it, just let it run all day. They let it run for two days. On the second day, mom and dad showed up picked him up took him to the barber, they cut his hair, washed it, cut his hair, came out he had this cute little crew cut. And they… and they texted me a picture immediately. How a young man that refused to drink out of a Sippy cup, refused to the point where we had to give them the bottle because he would not take liquids unless it was through the bottle. So we… he was being deprived of liquids if you weren't being able to give it… give it through the bottle because he wouldn't… he just wouldn't do the cup. I asked the teacher if he had a special friend and… and this was a kid that was, you know, verbal pretty… pretty, you know, high level on the spectrum. And I said 'You know, does he have a buddy here?' And he had one kid that he would look at a lot. I took a picture of that kid drinking out of a cup, we… we even bypass the Sippy cup part. We took the top off just had the kid put it on a loop, just stop the iPad in front of them let it loop within four times doing it, he was drinking out of the cup. I can tell you a story… And these are all new stories. I mean, I can go back in time. I can tell you story after story. How many people here struggle with teaching your kids or… or the kids that you work with any kind of personal care skills? Tooth brushing, hand washing whatever. You know, sometimes we'll… we'll take… And I'm not saying not to use the visuals because we talk about the visuals in sequence, but the visuals in sequence still have to be prompted. So you've got a fade the prompting to make the individual independent. I had a girl who was on homebound because she had pretty much destroyed the classroom and several people in the classroom staff wise. So she was on homebound instruction and I went in and one of the things she was working on was tooth brushing and they were having some issues with it. And her favorite person in the world was mom and I walked in and they had the strip on the bottom and they were prompting her to do it and she was escalating time after time again, and I walked in and I said 'Listen mom, would you just brush your teeth for me.' And she's like 'Sure.' I took a video on an iPhone put it on a loop, stuck it in front of her, let her go in, didn't tell her anything, had the stuff out, within three times watching it, she was brushing her teeth independently on her own. Uh… Behavior, I had a kid who in middle school was having so many aggressive behaviors. We we're baselining it at about 200 to 250 a day and his teacher was about eight months pregnant and he was a big boy. And we went in and looked at what was going on and through puberty and all the other things that come with middle school kids. And anybody here work with… with middle school kids? God bless every single one of you. Especially for the neurotypical kids. And I don't say this Cathy Pratt from the Indiana Resource Center has said it in her presentations and I think she quote somebody else, but I'm going to quote her. You know, why middle schools are so crazy, right? Because half the population is going through puberty and the other half is going through menopause. So there's a ton of hormones running around. I… I didn't say that she did, umm… but in this particular case, you know, for… for this individual the video modeling was, you know, we went to all video modeling and all his academic programs, so the language was the same, there were no differences. And we went from 250 a day down to zero… zero. Also have used it… How many people here work with kids that are included or should be included but aren't because of some of their more behavioral challenges? The technology is out there. I have so many kids that will go into middle school and at first are so overwhelmed by the environment they can't work in it, so what we've done is we've brought the classroom there into their special needs classroom. I have more kids Skyping now into the Gen Ed setting to get the information in the… these self-contained room. And last year, one of my kids who we did that, you know, in the beginning of middle school he just melted down and his meltdown was stick the hoodie over his head and put his head on the desk, and he was failing all his classes. And this is a kid that was very… very bright and should have been getting really… really good grades and he wasn't. He was overwhelmed as soon as he walked in the class, everything hit him and his meltdown was not like, you know, when you hear the word meltdown what do you think? Out of control, screaming, crying… His meltdown was hoodie over his head right to the desk, and did nothing. We took him into that… that setting, put him up on Skype. All of a sudden is we went from F to As where he should have been and then when we got to high school, we started reimbursing him back and now as a sophomore he's back in Gen Ed Total with very minimal support because we made the environment not aversive. I… I and I… I think you're getting the point here. I could go on and on with the stories of kids that I've worked with, with the video modeling. Umm… And it's so, I mean, if you look at the evidence-based strategies that are out there right now, it's one of the big ones and don't be surprised if you're not going to see a lot more with that. The DT trainer is a nice uh… Yes! Yeah, I'll try to… umm… I'll try to get a copy of a (inaudible) if I can okay. But this is www.dttrainer.com and that one uh… is a great tool for not teaching umm… new skills but for repetition for skills kids already have. So how many of my teachers here don't really have enough staff to really do your job? This is one of those avenues where kids can do the repetition on the computer and I think that they're still doing it I'm not quite sure but go on. Umm… If you've got a computer in your room, they'll give you a free 30-day trial of it. So you can go on and play with it and… and it's not that expensive. My reward board.com is the next one and that's for developing reinforcement systems and we're going to talk a little bit about that when I talk about strategies. Uh… And then hbmcoop.org is one of my favorite websites because it's the Hamilton Boone Madison co-op website for a school district. That's right outside of Indianapolis, Indiana and what they do is they have on their website a place where teachers can post all of the visuals that they use. How many people here use board maker with your kids? It'll come in board maker or it will come in a word document. And in the word document, you pull it up, print it, laminate it and you're ready to go. Its hbmcoop C-O-O-P.org. Is anybody familiar with ZAC Browser? Oh, good. They'd love it. Yeah, if you haven't seen… Who… who… who were my preschool school age kids? You know, some of our adult kids like a two but ZAC Browser is a website where it's the one stop shop for everything preschool. And it actually was designed by a… a grandfather. He had a grandson on the spectrum and for some reason this particular kid wasn't really good at navigating where that's usually not the case, isn't it? Because most kids might not be able to do much, but they can get on that SpongeBob SquarePants every time, right. They know exactly where Dorothy, the explorer lives, right. Umm… I still have a kid now and I do a lot of work in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia and there's a little guy and he's… he's for… for all intensive purposes he's non-verbal. He… he comes across significantly challenged, but we obviously know he's not because a lot of our kids, you know, what… what amazes me about kids on the spectrum is if you expect that much from them that's all you're going to get. They're not gonna give you any more than what you want. If you say you want something written but 25 words in it, guaranteed you're getting 25 words. If something is bonus or something is, you know, optional that's not done, it's optional. I mean, these kids are very specific about that that's why they expectations have to be raised. Umm… But this, you know, in… in ZAC Browser, you know, our kids, you know, can navigate almost anything. Remember that it's a plate… And it also has what I like about it, it is also has a lot of social skill places to play. Kids can also take turns and… and I… I'm sure Temple talked about taking turns. Umm… You know, because that was the one first thing that she talked about. And then all of the individuals I work with and this is freetypinggame.net ,all one word. All my kids start out typing right from the very beginning and isolating because a lot of our kids don't have a functional point when they first come in and I see all of our kids having functional points now, why do you think that? iPads! You can't slap at an iPad and come up with what you're looking for. You've got to isolate and now I'm not… I'm seeing so many more kids come in with an isolation and be real careful how you introduce the iPad to the young kids right from the very beginning. Because if it's introduced as a game or play technique, it will make… it might stay like that, and they will never use it for academics and they won't use it for scheduling and other things. You know, I like to introduce them to my young kids not as play toys, I'd like to introduce them more academically and then also with scheduling and organizational systems. Because I'm going to tell you right now especially from the really young levels, if you can give your kid any skill that they're going to be successful with as they grow older, they need an organizational system. They need a way to understand the world and that organizational system is gonna help them. Because as they get older, I mean, how many of you work with kids that are organizational nightmares? Umm… And… and it's, you know, it's… it's paramount that we… that we help them in that area. Now… it says EI Program here, but these strategies are strategies that I found effective with any kid umm… that I've worked with in my career uh… and all over the place, on ability level and also age, it just, you know, you… you modify him to make him work. And what I did is when I wrote the book, I looked at all of the different methodologies that were out there and cross reference them with all the techniques that they used, research-based or not. I just wrote them down and I wrote across the top all the strategies, and then I put Xs in the ones that overlapped. And seven strategies came out that were consistent with almost every single one of them, so what should that tell us? It should tell us that these seven strategies are probably gonna be the most effective way to work with individuals with an autism spectrum disorder. And as I see it when I give these talks, it works with a lot of different kids. It's just not autism specific, but that's what we're talking about today but these strategies are the ones that have been proven to probably be the most effective. The first one and I think one of the most important ones is repetition. These kids learn through repetition and we need to setup opportunities for them to use skills so that they use it more naturally. And that's where my sort of Temple thing comes up. Because as early in my career when I… when I saw Temple, you know, if this fan was going on here that would distract her and she would probably ask somebody to turn it off and she would get flustered. Now she just goes with the flow, I mean, sitting here today with her mother, you know, when the big booming one comes on, when the air conditioning comes on and it sounds like it's pouring outside, you know, not even skip a beat. Early on, she would say something and the crowd would laugh, and you can almost see it in her face. It wasn't meant to be funny. Now she purposely says things for funny. I always like to equate this in… in my career in sports. I mean, I grew up, you know, athletically. Uh… And, you know, I have brothers and sisters that are athletes and played every sport I could uh… and even to this day, you know, my all the TV shows I watch umm… I just love the… the competition part of them. Because my favorite show right now is Top Chef. Anybody seen Top Chef? Okay, 99% of that food I would never eat. I mean, I'm steak and potatoes and that's about it and then I don't venture very far from my comfort zone food wise. But I love the competition part, you know, though… You know, I'll watch anything in competition. But repetition is how we teach and train athletes, right. Because if you're a basketball player and you've come up and you've shown that you can make a layup. Do you stop there? No, if you're good, you do layup after… layup after… layup after… layup and if your coaches are good they change the activity we are still make layups, but you're not as bored because you're just not doing them over and… over and… over again there… they're making it a little different. If you're a quarterback and you throw a pass and the first one is a perfect spiral right to the target. Do you stop? No, you don't. You do it over and… over and… over again. Why? Why do we do that? A lot of people say muscle memory, right. Practice makes perfect. Why do we do it? So that the skill becomes automatic. You don't think about it and way too many times especially when we're trying to teach social skills, we don't put kids in enough opportunities to use the skill. We think by writing a social story and let them see at one time a day or maybe one time a week that all of a sudden somewhere out there through osmosis they're going to pick this skill up and use it somewhere else. Where if you're gonna teach the skill, you better use it over and… over and… over again. And it's about the repetition. It's about getting the kid, you know, and even if they're contrived because most of the time you're gonna have to set up situations. So if you know a kid's having a specific issue with a specific thing, and you need them to use a skill, you better setup opportunities throughout that day and I'm not talking one or two, especially if it's disruptive, it better be 20 or 30 opportunities a day. Because then as time goes on it becomes second nature and they're gonna use the skill, if not and it happens once every month, this behavior what's gonna happen, they're gonna revert back to the behaviors that get them success. Positive/negative it doesn't matter, it's what their success level is with that behavior. Does it get me out of this situation? Yeah, you might be removed, you know, teacher might do something, it doesn't matter. I got removed didn't I. When there's a better way of doing it. Umm… And, you know, even in repetition with what I was like, you know, let's say your team as the football and they score and they're up by one, the other team has it, they move all the way down the field, there is one second left on the clock and what do the opponents normally… It's a chip-shot field goal, so they're getting ready to line up for the field goal and right before the kicker kicks to feel goal, what does the opposing team do? Call the timeout, right? Why do you call timeout? To ice the kicker, right. You always hear ice the kicker. Well, what you're trying to have happen is you're trying to have that kicker think about what they're about to do, right? Now at the pro-level you should have enough repetition and be good enough at it that this is the shouldn't matter, you've been doing it so long, it's automatic, right, through that repetition and you're skilled at it. But in the… in college and in high school or even lower middle school, it creeps in because what does the person starts thinking about? Oh, my God! Am I getting wrong. This is for the game (inaudible) and then what does that… what does that create? What emotion does that create? Anxiety. How many of the individuals you work with or your own kids have anxiety issues? If you don't give coping mechanisms for them to decrease that and help them to understand it and incorporate it through the repetition, then it's gonna creep in. So when the anxiety creeps in, things are gonna come out, that are not always so appropriate. And I always like to use this one. I used to use Tiger Woods as an analogy before, now I bring them on the backend. Because at least in my lifetime he was probably the most gifted athlete I've ever seen. I mean, this guy, you know, one major after major and change to swing, not for any other reason except to challenge himself. You know just a phenomenal athlete and then what happened that Thanksgiving, right? The driver was in his wife's hand, right? And then since then has he'd been the same golfer. I mean, he's won some… he's won some… some tournaments, but he hasn't won a major and that's how he defines himself what happened? He's the same athlete he was. He's since had issues, you know, recently but he's the same athlete and you get better as you get older in golf. You know, he's in his prime. And when he was over a 10-foot putt to win ten years ago, he won. Now if he's over that 10-foot putt, you've got a better than 20% shot he's gonna make it. How is he different? It's the mental toughness. It creeps in… it creeps in doubt creeps in and when the doubt creeps in… in with our individuals, they don't have those opportunities so it's… it's huge for the repetition part in my opinion that we started to… to and incorporate that. Now shaping, shaping is when you take the approximation of a behavior that you're looking for and you heavily reinforced small components of it up to the whole, and what I mean by that is let's say the individual you want them to say 'Mommy' and you get… you can get Mm… out of them. So in the beginning you're gonna except Mm… heavily reinforce it and then once they start to do it consistently then they're not getting that really powerful reinforcer until they say 'Ma.' So you add one part to it and then after that you add 'Mommy' and then you get and shape the entire behavior. Because way too many times we are quick to want everything all at once and sometimes we need to take these big behaviors that we're looking for, and when I say behavior, I'm not meaning something negative because I'm sure most people think negative, when you say behavior. You know, having her say or him say something is still a behavior that I might be looking for in the teaching realm. How do I shape that to get it there? I had a little girl recently where I was working with and the speech and language pathologist wanted her to do a one-step command of come here. So in the beginning what would happen is that she… that she loved umm… Skittles that was her to die for and I'll talk about that in a second. But she loves Skittles and it was so funny because the first time we did it, the speech and language pathologist said 'Okay, what are we working for showed her the Skittles' and she looked at it and got excited, and that she put on her table and the girl was like maybe like 10 steps away so she would have that opportunity to stand up and come to her. Umm… And the girl (inaudible) her chair up, stole the Skittle and (inaudible) it back. And so that's a good for her I said, you know, but after that we knew nothing let the Skittle stay out umm… and then the… the speech and language pathologist said 'Come here.' And I watched it go like two or three times and every time she had the physically prompt her to bring her to herself and then… and then reinforcer (inaudible) but she didn't get the powerful reinforcer until she does it independently. Now as I'm watching it, you could see that in the beginning, she would… her little that she could come off the chair and then she would sit back down, and I said just as soon as you see that heavily reinforced that with the Skittle first. And this teacher was wonderful because she, you know, how big is a Skittle like that big. She could get it in like 100 pieces. Anybody here have that skill? You know, so just the taste and after five trials, all of a sudden she was getting it. And then she was up and then she was coming and then we reshaped it to the behavior we were looking for, accepting those small… those small approximations. Umm… And most the strategies out there really look at that. Chaining… chaining is taking real complex behaviors and breaking them down into their component parts and teaching the parts up to the whole. Now there's two ways to do it. With some of our individuals you can do whole task presentation and what I mean by whole task presentation is, you show the kid ones, they do it and you're done. Now how often does that happen? Sometimes with some of the kids it's great, but where are my middle school people? How many of the kids that you inherit have gaps in som of those skills where they can do some and then can't complete or breakdown somewhere in the chain? Okay, where are my preschool people and early childhood? You can blame them for that, right. Because the way it was taught, we use a ton of verbal prompting and verbal prompts are the hardest prompts to fade. Because if you walk a kid through washing their hands every single time, each step that they do becomes an individual trial within itself. So who has to be there to make them successful? You do, because what is the goal of the hand washing, the toileting, brushing the teeth, the face washing, the showering, the bathing what are… what is our goal there? That you can say to the kid, go brush your teeth and the kid goes in brushes their teeth and comes out independently, isn't it. It's not a social activity, right? Yet what we do is we talk them through it every time and for a lot of our individuals if you talk them through it every time what ends up happening? Anybody ever have a kid just stand there and wait after they do one thing and then look at you like 'Okay, tell me to do the next piece,' even though they know it. I mean, when… when I missed the beginning of Temple and her mother's chat here which I'm gonna get the DVD myself uh… because this its… its just an honor for me to come here and be after them because that's the first I've never seen that before and I don't think it's ever been done before. It's just phenomenal and amazing. I was on a quick conference call with a family, I'm working with in New Jersey and we were talking about the young man umm… and what he does now even though he knows what to do as soon as you say 'Okay, it's time to come to dinner.' He'll go 'Who? Me.' He knows everybody's going to dinner and he waits until she says 'Yes, you.' And we talked about how to fade that verbal prompt out and how to make him successful and independent adding. Because as kids come out of preschool one of the biggest things that we need to teach is their ability to follow adult direction because their success in school is going to be predicated on that skill… on that skill and that's a whole nonverbal prompting hierarchy. And… and I always like, you know, I do a lot of behavior. And most of the time, when I go into see a kid that is having behavior problems, 9 times out of 10, I'm finding that the teaching is some of the issues not understanding the prompting hierarchy, not understanding how to faded appropriately, not understanding that this kid might not learn the same way everybody else does and there might be certain strategies or techniques that you need to incorporate for that kid to be successful, which also works with all the other kids. And that's what it's amazing to me, you know, the teachers that that'll take it and run with it and they're like 'Wow! You know, I'm using this with my neurotypical kids just as much as I'm using it with, you know, my other kid.' You know, visuals, you know, alternate ways of learning for these kids. Umm… And chaining is very specific also. Because chaining, you need to find out where the kid is in… in the sequence. So if I say to the kid 'Brush your teeth.' and they walk in and they pick up the toothbrush. I know they know what the toothbrush is, right? And then they start flicking it. Well, that's not appropriate. So we know, they know what the toothbrush is. Next time, I teach it or if I'm doing trials right there one after the other I go 'Brush your teeth' and the kid goes in and he picks it up. Then I immediately prompt him to pick up the toothpaste and my program stops there. I reinforced the kid heavily there that's beautiful brushing your teeth and then I do the remainder of the chain hand-over-hand so the kid doesn't make a mistake. And after I get two days of independence on picking up the toothpaste, then the next time I prompt taking the cap off and for some of our individuals you can skip some of those steps, they might know what to do, but if you do the physical prompting for the rest, you'll go through that chain much faster because they haven't learned the chain in appropriately. Is that makes sense? I mean, and that's the best way to do it when you're doing. And I've also use chaining in teaching specific behaviors. Go forward and backward chain, kids out of environments. Umm… And I had a kid who's in kindergarten and mom wanted him to have some inclusionary opportunities and they picked Jim as the inclusionary opportunity. And when I went in to see him because he was in first grade now and they were having some issue, so I went in to see him umm… and I was told what happened in… in kindergarten and when I went in, it was almost a surreal. I was almost… Anybody here ever here have… had a of body experience? I'd like sort of stood back and watched what was going on and was not shocked, but amazed by it. Because this little guy would walk in and it's of neurotypical Phys Ed Class, you know, and the kids are doing kickball game and my kid is independently doing all kinds of other stuff while this game is going on. Anybody ever watch that? And… and… and kids are like making, you know, adjustments for him and he's just doing his thing and every once in while he jumped in kick the ball and any (inaudible) gone, you know, and it look normal to everybody and I'm like this isn't normal, and I'm like what… what… what was our goal here? What's our goal with this young man? And they're like 'Well, we want him to be with his neurotypical peers, but we also need them to be non-disruptive.' You know, because obviously uh… they said 'We were doing it for socialization.' I'm like 'You think he's socializing here?' He's just… It's a free for all for a half hour it's what it is for him. Umm… So long story short, I went in and we forward chained him into Phys Ed. Phys Ed teacher was wonderful. She's… she was remarkable I loved her. And she was very organized and she did things the same way in sequence, so I loved what she was doing. Umm… and I said, you know, 'Can you give me a schedule on how you run your classes got it?' So he came to the door, took us a month because the cue or the SD to run around was what? When he stepped through… when he stepped through the threshold of that door that was the cue for me to run around and we had to stop that. So for a month he just walked with his class to the door and was reinforced for that. Then, the next phase was he went in and, you know, how, you know, Phys Ed teachers have their spots, he had a signified spot, he'd go he'd sit down and we'd get him out. It us another month and then after nine months. Now how many of you would really… really wait that long? Because we are a quick fix society? We want things done right away. And in behavioral change and shaping behavior, sometimes that's not the way it goes. I've worked with kids where the behavior plan has taken two, three years to really come to fruition and really have the effect that we were looking at initially. But we don't hang on long enough. If we don't get something happening quickly, we change it. And once we change it that kid is now set in motion what we call an intermittent reinforcement schedule, which means that the behavior is either gonna stay the same or increase. Because intermittent reinforcement is great with teaching behavior, it's horrible when you're trying to shape behaviors and trying to umm… get out of, you know, maladaptive behaviors. And we don't do that enough because, you know, systematically we waited. I mean, and I don't think we would have got there and after nine months for the last month, he was wonderful and then this year when we started, he was… he… he went right back into the routine like it never stopped. And he was an individual that, you know, on the spectrum that was pretty significantly challenged. To me, the one thing you're gonna assess more than any other thing is reinforcement motivators. What motivates the kid? That kid's not gonna be motivated by the same things you're motivated by and the same things I'm motivated by. And the best way to do reinforcer assessment is something called a forced reinforcer assessment. If you go online and… and Google it, it'll come up and it'll give you the structured techniques on how to do it, but globally what it is, is you get a box and you talk to every person in that kid's life and you find out guardians, bus drivers, anybody that's impacted this kid's life and you stick them all in this box. And every kid can make a choice. I don't care how challenge they are. You take two things out and say 'What do you want to work for?' The kid makes a choice, you have a list of all the activities. If the kid does the work and earns the… the whatever it is they chose, you put a plus, if they didn't, you put a minus. And you add up all the pluses and minuses, and that will give you a pretty good idea. I am a big fan of systems for kids. I'm a bigger fan of the randomness of it. And I'm gonna tell you about that in a second. Umm… Because you've got to get these systems to be random. Where are my middle high school people again? Or middle high school kids? How many of your kids still look to be reinforced after everything that they do? That's not their fault, that's our fault. We've trained that… we've trained that. And don't run back and say Jim Ball said 'Don't reinforce kids or motivate kids' because that's not what I'm trying to say, but its knowing the system. Because when we're teaching a skill initially, you're gonna have that one-to-one pairing, the kid does it. They're gonna get that high powered reinforce, you want to catch him in. And once you catch him in then what do you want to do? You want to elongate it. They get… they get something every other one, every third one, every fifth one. Then, they don't know when the reinforcer is coming. You're gonna maintain behavior at a higher level if you do it that way. If you get a kid hooked on a system that's every single time, what happens is when you try to change it, the behavior drops like a stone and this is umm… I used to… I don't know if you know Peter Gerhard, but he's a person in the… in the field who has worked exclusively with adults. Uh… Most of his career and I've had the great opportunity of… of working with him and this is a story he tells as an example. And I think it's one of the best examples of understanding, you know, intermittent reinforcement. You're and your place of business, you walk into the staff lounge, you trip on the carpet, as you trip on the carpet you fall into the soda machine as you fall in this in the soda machine to get your balance you hit it once, as you hit it a soda comes out, it's your brand and your flavor. There's nobody around, you drink it. The next day, you come in you look around there's nobody around you hit the machine once, outcomes the soda, it's your brand and your flavor, there's nobody around, you drink it. For a month, you walk in, you hit the machine, outcomes a soda, it's your brand and your flavor there's nobody around you, you drink it. Unbeknownst to you, the next day they find out they're losing money on your brand and your flavor of soda, so they fix the machine. You walk into the staff lounge, what have you been conditioned over that month, one hit gets me one soda, correct? Now if you're like me, after you hit it the first time and didn't get it you might have thought you didn't hit it hard enough, so you hit it again, but after that what happens to the hitting behavior, it extinguishes immediately. This isn't rocket science. This is pretty consistent and you can watch it in behavior, watch it in your own families. It's done with everybody. Now same situation different set of circumstances. You walk into the staff lounge, you trip on the carpet as you fall into the soda machine, you kick it twice and hit it twice, outcomes of soda, your brand and your flavor, there's nobody around you, you drink it. Next day you walk in, nobody around you look you hit the machine 10 times and kick it 5 times outcomes of soda, your brand and your flavor, there's nobody around you, you drink it. For a month, you kick it anywhere between 30 and 40 times and punch it anywhere between 20 and 40 times. Now comes a soda that's your brand and your flavor, you drink it. The next day they come in, learn that they're losing money on your brand and your flavor of soda, they fixed the machine. When you walk in how many times might you kick it or punch it? You don't know, right? Now as you're sitting there kicking and punching it, what are you doing? You're exercising, aren't you, right. So now you get sweaty, right. How valuable is that drink now. There's a drink have more value because you're getting thirstier. So now quantity and quality of reinforcement comes in and that's why we need to get to intermittent systems. And all the systems I use now with all the individuals I work with start out as a one-to-one pairing, but as time goes on they've got to become random. Because if you don't make them intermittent and we don't all get constant reinforcement, do we? Now ours is intermittent and that's what the real world has, so understanding that concept it's great in teaching behavior because the kid never knows when the reinforcer is coming so therefore the behavior maintains itself, you know, at a… at a pretty high level. Now in behavior reduction that's not what we want to have happen, right? Because we've got to get every single episode and everything we do uh… because if an intermittent reinforcement schedule comes into play in behavior what's gonna happen? The behaviors either gonna maintain itself or it's gonna increase. That's why a lot of times you'll hear about consistency of implementation. Anybody ever seen the shows Nanny 911, Supernanny any of the nanny shows? What's her big thing in that show with the family? It's about consistency of implementation. Whatever they decide to do, it's about consistency and implementation. And whose behavior do they truly change? Parents, its adult behavior… its adult behavior. I do functional behavior assessment for living. And I'm unusually called in when the kids got one foot on a banana peel and the other one's headed to a residential facility. Umm… So these kids have either had, you know, chronic behavior problems and I'm coming into make a determination. I've had I've been very successful at working with a lot of these individuals and keeping them in… in their natural settings. Umm… But when I come in I can tell you 9 times out of 10, I'm not doing anything with the kid, it's the environment, it's the adults, it's showing strategies that are gonna be effective. It's critical that we do a lot around play skills uh… especially with the little ones. And understand that boys and girls are very… very different players. Because we'll try to throw our, you know, our kids on the spectrum the boys into reciprocal social play at really young ages and they don't do that if. You take a bunch of seven-year-old neurotypical boys and dump out a bunch of dinosaurs and let them play. Watch what they do? They will all play with the material correctly, but they're playing individual games. There… they're not interacting with each other. Men play very… very differently than women. How many women here have ever had your significant other in your life and decided that with your girlfriend that you're gonna get your significant other together with her significant other? Since we are besties, they'll be besties. How many men here have actually had to live that scenario? You know, men… men are very… We interact very differently. I always like to talk about umm… play skills and… and social skills in the way we are like men and women, I like to do it around toileting, right. Women take other women to the bathroom with them, right. It's a social event. You share things under the stall, you talk to each other, you have a little powder room area, you know, contrary to popular belief. Men don't take other men to the bathroom with them. And there is unwritten man law. That if you go in and the first urinal is used or being used, you go as far away as possible to go. If women use urinals, you would back ride in and you'll be chatting with each other. We don't do that. Yet, will force our boys too. So if you're teaching you're young men on the spectrum especially at the younger ages, do it by teaching them how to appropriately play with the material. Because that will keep them in the social interaction with their peers. I can't tell you how many times I walk in and I hear the neurotypical kids say 'He don't play right.' How many times have you heard that? Because there's my kid on the train table hoarding all the Thomas the Tank Engines, right. And the other kids are like, you know, or they're building something and my kid crashes it over, you know, it's because there's different games going on. And then we try to make the neurotypical kid conform. If they know how to play with the materials correctly and you know what a… what a great way to teach this is? Video modeling. I was in umm… Anybody ever been in Texas or worked in Texas? Okay, if you've worked in Texas. Okay, Texas has PPCD Classes, which are their preschool special needs classes and these are usually kids that are significantly challenged. Umm… And I've been working in the Irving Independent School District which is right outside of Dallas where Cowboy Stadium used to be uh… now it's in Arlington if you didn't know. Umm… And they uh… We wanted to do some play skills teaching because, you know, and one of the preschool teachers and I've been doing… I've been working with this district for almost 15 years now uh… and I've been working with this one PPCD teacher for a long time. She sort of looked at me and rolled their eyes and I love her to death so I accept, you know, when she says something that's really meaningful to me and she looked at me she goes Jim listen. She goes 'I got seven kids in here, me and my aide. And I… I barely get through toileting and you want me to teach play skills.' You know, and I'm like listen let's try this. So what we did is we took materials that were in their environment, so it's not… not things that they don't or not exposed to, they were things that were in their environment. We took small videos of a neurotypical kid, we had the video sign off from the family, neurotypical kid came into that environment, we took a two-minute video, put it on a loop, showed it on the smart board and just put tape down and the only thing I told the aid that I want to do during that center time activity was keep them in the box. And we taught them real quickly that during that time they stayed in the box and we put the toys on the table. We didn't make them do anything, we didn't interact with them, we didn't give them (inaudible), we didn't say play, we just left the materials and we let this loop on the screen. And there was a kid in there umm… and two of the young men, who we did it with initially uh… were nonverbal at the time. Walked in, we… we let it go. It took us about a week to keep them in the box, right. Reinforcing them for stay in there but we kept them in the box, then they started to watch and then the next thing you see, is you see him picking up the car, and then you see him rolling it, and then you see him playing with it and then the one while I was there goes broom… broom because the kid on the screen said it. Anybody ever seen the Talking Tomcat on your iPad apps? I've actually seen two kids start talking to that app. Because prior to that they wouldn't say anything but when I was there once, we were… I just pulled it up and we were talking, and… and I thought he was verbal after I was playing with them for like ten minutes and the teacher comes over and she goes 'What's that him?' Kid never talked before. He had verbal language and it was more reinforcing to see this cat do whatever it did. So again the video mod… It's just… it's extremely powerful. Umm… And then extinction, probably gonna be your number one behavior management strategy… number one behavior management strategy. Now especially with the little ones, we are so quick to jump on things and sometimes by jumping on it immediately or trying to correct it immediately, you could inadvertently reinforce inappropriate behavior and then the kid does it. I'm sure most of you know positive attention, negative attention, it really doesn't matter, attention is attention. And I always lived by if they're not killing themselves or anybody else, ignore it. Now that's easier said than done with some of the older kids because some of the older kids will upped the ante, right. So and I'm not talking about planned ignoring here either because there is a difference. Because most people when they think of extinction, think of planned ignoring and they're different. And planned ignoring is a great strategy, but that's not what I'm talking about. Because planned ignoring is if the kid starts the behavior, I turned my back to him, like I'm not giving him any attention. While that works for some kids, but the planned ignoring also could be enough to reinforce it because you're doing something. Because is everybody familiar exactly what extinction is? It's ignoring the behavior, but not the kid. So the first time you're trying to get the kid to respond to adult direction and I say to the child, you know, the child gets up and darts at a group. I stand up I say 'Billy! Come here' and Billy doesn't come. So I go and I walk over and I get Billy and I take him back to the circle and sometimes when I'm doing that he's having a little meltdown, right. Lot of body fluids, crying, you know, and you're like this. You ever do that. I mean, you get him and his little feeder dragon and then you get back, and you sit him in the chair and you're like 'What a good boy listening.' while he's still screaming. That's extinction. I'm not… I'm not ignoring the child, I'm ignoring all the extraneous behaviors. And if I do that consistently enough with the little ones, they'll start to respond to the adult direction. With the families that I work with, I'm heavily into and it's the same thing I just say it a little differently. I'm like 'Don't say the command unless you're willing to follow through on it.' Because what you do is you end up setting up them waiting. I grew up in a family of six, Joe, Janet, Jeanette, Jeff, Jim and Jay. Anybody grew up in a similar environment where you had a lot of (inaudible) we called everything but your own name, you know, a lot of times. You know, growing up I thought I was Jesus Christ and my brother was damn it, right. That's an old Bill Cosby joke. But, you know, and on my family you be on each of… You know, the one below you to show them where they were on the food chain, you know, and I had a younger brother. So I was smart enough. I waited for my mother to be on the phone cooking and then I hit him. He'd yelp and I'd hear 'Jimmy!' Okay, Jimmy's a nice, you know. She's the only one the calls me Jimmy that was in a nice tone, so I stop, wait. She's back on the phone cooking. I smack him, I hear 'James Michael! And how many people here use their kid's middle name when they're in trouble? Okay, it's called an establishing operation in the ABA Literature that means something good's not going to happen, right. And then she gets back on the phone cooking. I hit him again I hear 'James Michael Ball' phone goes down I (inaudible) butt I get up underneath the bed, she comes in it became this big thing. Now we're gonna assume I was neurotypical? What did she teach me? I had three opportunities before she was gonna do anything. Kids on the spectrum will take that to the end degree. How many families or parents in here have thought initially or even sometimes that you think your kid is deaf? Because you repeat yourself constantly, you know, and if they're over selective into something else they're not listening to you, and a lot of families will report initially that they did think their child was deaf because they didn't respond. It's about the over selection and that's why you give the cue, you know, the SD which is the descriptive stimulus which is the cue come here and then you do whatever it is you need to do to get the child to come there nonverbally and then reinforce it, all the while ignoring all the extraneous behaviors because you're only reinforcing what you want to see, even though you had to prompt it. And that again goes back to the teaching part… that goes back to the teaching part. I had a young man… Does anybody know what power cards are? (inaudible) heard of power card? Okay, some of you. Umm… It's the work of Brenda Smith Myles. Umm… And I'll… I'll explain what a power cord is, but I want to do it for the extinction part. I had a little guy on the spectrum, a kindergarten class and they… they brought me in because he was having a toilet accidents. And I came in and I… I got the whole story and what happened is when he, you know, when little kids get so engrossed in something that they sometimes forget and then at that last minute when it's a panic they just go and that happens a lot it for neurotypical kids in preschool and kindergarten. I mean, it's… it's a… it's a normal occurrence, but I think because of the whole issue with and maybe their, you know, their disability or whatever uh… when it happened for this little guy, the teacher sort of made a big deal out of it. And not in a bad way but she made a big deal out of it. So after it being an accident at first and her not just putting it on extinction and just ignoring it and taken a man and change in him and whatever, she made this big deal. So the next day he walks in, he stands in the middle of the class and he just wets himself. He just goes. I'm like 'That's wonderful.' Umm… So find out in a power cord it's very similar to a social stories. Anybody know what social stories are? Carroll Grey's work. Umm… You know, Future Horizons carries a lot of Carroll's stuff and it's… Her… her stuff is wonderful. But a power cord takes it to that umm… Temple calls it that… I call it the perseveration and that… that interest at high interest point, you know, that… that thing of high interest. Now you have individuals that you work with that have things that they're, you know, very interested in and we'll talk about it over and… over and… over again. You know, umm… this particular kid loves Spider-Man. So we wrote a story about Spider-Man and it started out with and here's… and there's a picture of Spider-Man going through the city, here a Spider-Man going through the city and all the sudden Spider-Man has to go to the bathroom. Then, go to the next card and what should he do? And then we go to the next card that goes he should go in the bathroom and they show them going into the men's room. He should go in the bathroom and use the facilities appropriately and then goes back to, you know, cleaning the world up whatever. He wrote a whole little story about it. Because Spider-Man didn't pee his pants, the kid didn't pee his pants anymore. So you take that special interest Thomas the Tank Engine. I just did one with a kid who was into Goosebumps, the reading of Goosebumps. So we took some of the characters in there and taught him because he was the kid who would run out to the playground and he would shove the kid off of the swing because he wanted the swing. And people were like making him say 'He was sorry to the person and all that.' I tried to explain to them. It has… I could've been a rock on there. It wasn't about what was on there… who was on there, it was about the swing, they wanted to swing and they didn't know how to get the swing, but to do that because you know what when they did that did they get the swing? Yeah, they did. So we talked about, you know, that and some of the characters and it actually worked out really… really well because then we gave him coping mechanisms, what can you do instead and that's where that assumption comes in again. Because we'll assume by just telling him 'Well, you just have to ask' or the rule is I just have to wait in line or go ask, you know, we'll give them that rule on the playground for everybody else, that doesn't work a lot of times for our kids. We've got to give them the coping mechanisms. And if you want to teach them that rule that's great because the… the ultimate goal is to have them conform to whatever the rule is in the classroom. But initially we might have to do things a little differently to get them to do that… to get them to do that. And, you know, I think a lot of you might know it, but, you know, a vast majority of our kids also are very egocentric. It's… it's not about you and it's always funny because and Temple will talk about this. There's a fine line between Asperger's and gifted, right. There's a fine line. And I'm not gonna get into all the research and all that, but as I see it with… with a real simple example, if you again look at the Big Bang Theory, right. You've got Sheldon and then you've got Leonard. I don't know if they're writing him into be Asperger's, but he's got a lot of the characteristics. Leonard is the gifted one because Leonard knows enough in a social situation to conform, right. So if it's a regular like… like party that they go to Penny's House for, right. He'll have his Star Trek uniform underneath his clothes, but if Sheldon wanted to wear it, he would wear it there. So that makes sense? Umm… And… and that to me… And I… I really never got that because I… I wouldn't factor it into the things that I did it as a behaviorist thinking, you know, variables and how they do it. But one day it hit me because we'd always talked about the egocentrism more. I talked about it and it seemed in some kids, but I didn't realize how sometimes it manifested itself. Umm… And this story comes from Kristie Lofland, who was with the Indiana Resource Center for Autism, Cathy Pratt (inaudible) and it's such a poignant story uh… and this young man who was totally included in a second grade class umm… and he uh… I went to, you know, Kristie talks about going to see him and he had a beautiful morning. And the whole morning, you know, you probably couldn't have even pick them out in the classroom that's how well he was doing. As she was leaving she was talking to the principal. When she was talking to the principal, all hell broke loose in the cafeteria and it was him and he had and this kid was verbal, could get his needs and wants (inaudible) very effectively, he had a lot of coping mechanisms, really good skills. So she went in and he's having this meltdown, you know, and we finally had to like remove him, like physically remove him out of the… out of the area. Took him in, sat him down and… and this isn't the teachable moment, this is a teaching moment because you want to sort of get the… the thought process. Because did you ever look at your individuals, you know, or your own kids? If you follow their logic train, it might take a right or a left and a couple bumps, but when it gets to the station it sort of makes sense, if you follow it, right, you know, if you follow the logic train. This kid, we're trying to figure out his logic train. And this is again where one of those moments where you figure it out and she uses, you know, like I do a lot of methods that are… that are visual. Because you want… you don't want to start talking to them about it especially at that moment when they have heightened anxiety or heightened frustration because what ends up happening when you do that and try to talk to him there? You just reescalated, you know, your verbal language, they're not processing, so you're escalating it. So when you're trying to bring somebody down or you're trying to umm… redirect, it all has to be non-verbal. If you'd do it verbally, you're gonna just heighten it all back up again. And in this particular case, she started using this visual and you don't have to draw real world because I don't and I've learned this from her. You draw… she drew the lunch lady, the cabinet that the… that was in front of her, then him, a girl behind him and a little boy behind him and… and again I know, you have not to be great at drawing, you just draw it, but you have to use this technique, you have to… the kid has to know the difference between a thought bubble and a talk bubble, is everybody familiar with the differences? So she asked him she goes 'You know, why? Why did you do this?' And he goes "There was no chocolate milk.' So she put the little thought bubble over his head and she wrote 'There is no chocolate milk.' He… he goes, she goes. What do you think Mrs. Jackson, the lunch lady was thinking? And she puts the little thought bubble over her head? And without hesitation… without hesitation what does he say 'There's no chocolate milk.' And he's like 'No, Mrs. Jackson thinking why is Jack on the floor crying' and sort of looks at her. And he goes what was Allison thinking? Puts a little thought bubble over Allison's head? And again without hesitation what does he say 'There's no chocolate milk.' No, Allison's like 'Wow! Jack's having a really bad day.' And then what was Brad thinking? The last kid with a little trepidation in his voice he goes 'There's no chocolate milk.' And now are you getting it? How egocentric is that? He walked in that room and thought every single person in that room was thinking the same exact thing he was thinking. That's why… why use my language. Everybody already knows ''There's no chocolate milk,' right. And had he asked? There was chocolate milk in the back. And of course, let we put the talk bubble and what could you have said 'Is there any chocolate milk.' And then for the next month what do we have to do? We have to make sure that there's no chocolate milk because again we go back to the first thing we talked about repetition, right. And he has to ask every time so we have to do it repetitiously. And then eventually what do we have to do? There is no chocolate milk like really 'No chocolate milk.' Now what saved us on this one was that I got him a little Nestle quick bag that he could put in the regular milk and he was good with that. So I didn't have to go there. And we tried that a couple times and he was good with it. Umm… So we just came up with a different strategy for him and of course he was little compulsive, so he remembered it every time. But do he get that, I mean, again, you know, umm… and if you… if you understand that part of… of these kids, it's easier to program for them. Because it's not about you and a lot of times I think we take offense to some things that they do. Because some of our kids especially our higher level kids, they have a lot of issues with, you know, umm… impulse control, right. What flies in here, flies out here, right? And when they walk up to you and say that you have a (inaudible) with five hairs in it, you have a (inaudible) with five hairs in it, I guarantee that. And it's not about being personal to you it's a fact… it's a fact. I was just… Last year, I was in a high school in New Jersey. My littleAspee (inaudible) guy doing really well. Umm… He was… He was in Spanish class and they were moving from the classroom down to the computer lab and while they're moving down to the computer lab, umm… he's transitioning and he's transitioning fine, but he's got his face in a book, right. Umm… Because that's what he… he does during his transition. So I don't even know how he navigates, he must just remembers, but he's got this book on his face. And he's got the book on his face, I'm behind him, the teacher is on the side and there's two students in front, and one of the students in the fronts, a male student and his pants are halfway down is butt, right, so his boxers are showing and the teacher's like (inaudible) would you pull your pants up, so, you know, and they make a joke out of it 'Oh, sorry, teach" and she's like 'Oh, just keep your pants up, but he spent his pants up.' And as we're walking my littleAspee goes that behavior started in prison and it would… it would signify what gang you were in and, you know, and he told you all of the facts about it. Now if one didn't know him, one would think what? That he was busting on him, right. And that could've been an ugly situation. But again when he said it, he was just giving you the facts, right. You know, I'm gonna date myself really… really bad. Anybody ever watch Dragnet? The facts, only the facts. It's… it's about the facts and that's why you know a lot of times our kids when we're teaching it, we've got to teach time and place. There are certain things that are private thoughts as opposed to public thoughts, and really differentiating and being concrete between the two because again with some of our higher level kids, what we will do is assume? And we'll just need to tell him once and they'll get it. That's not true… that's not true. Don't assume it, teach it. If you've taught it and they know it, you've reinforced it. If they haven't you taught a new skill, but don't… I… That's the one pitfall that I've learned in my 30 years is that I never assume anything. Because I've… I faltered greatly in doing that… I faltered greatly in doing that. Umm… And then rapport building and behavioral momentum. It's interesting how a lot of times these individuals can… And… and Temple talks about it so eloquently, you know, through their senses can figure you out quickly and they know, you know, if you're afraid of them they know, if you like them, you know, and we don't have to like all of our kids, I understand that. We have to respect them though, like we do everybody else. And it's the ones that we get, it's by getting to know them. Because every kid is different… every kid is different. And one of the… the bad (inaudible), I think a lot of our individuals get is you'll hear a lot of times at our kids, you know, don't… don't have empathy, you know, because of the executive functioning issues, they don't have empathy, that's not true. Because in a lot of cases, there's two types of empathy, right. There's… there's the intellectual empathy where you take yourself and put yourself in somebody else's shoes and try to see it from their vantage point, right. Now how many of you really in here do that on a consistent basis? I know I don't. I have to think about it if I got to do that. Then there is reactive empathy, right and that's when things happen when you're sorrowful or whatever. And it's interesting I've had many little kid I've worked with where when mommy cries. I've seen them crawl up into their lap and push the tears away because they don't want them to cry. They know that they're upset, that's empathy. And I just had an interesting… interesting experience with a young man he's… a he's at the University of Charleston, and I spent umm… about an hour with them because his mom wanted me to talk to him about the death of his grandmother. And his grandparents are… are very integral parts of his life and she was afraid because he had just finished… he just graduated, he's a chemist and he got a full scholarship for a Master's program at the University of Florida, Tallahassee to… to do chemistry and he explained to me in that hour, 45 minutes of it, umm… how he was going to cure cancer. There's no doubt in my mind that you're gonna be reading about this kid probably in another five years, he is that talented and that brilliant, and what are the things that he wants to do. That he lost me in the first about three minutes of the conversation that went on for another 42 minutes because I had no clue what he was talking about umm… but it sounded good. Umm… And mom was afraid because he was gonna be leaving and they lived in Charleston, so even though he stayed on the dorms, he was close to home and after his grandmother died, he really didn't show any umm… You know, emotion about it and she was afraid that he would get down to Florida and have a cathartic experience and not be able to hurt, not be able to get there, so she wanted me to talk to him. And when I'm talking to him, mom starts to relate stories too because mom was there and it was interesting because the story she relates really shows how empathetic he actually was. Because but he was his way, not… not… not, you know, societies way of doing it. Umm… They grew up like my mom and dad and the kid was here, grandma and grandpa were right next door, so from the time he could toddle, he would go down the stairs, up their stairs and he hang out with them all the time. Umm… The… the mother even relayed that you'd hate to be around the grandmother… grandfather and the son because they were both staunch conservatives, they had the same religious stuff so when they talk, they were, you know, that the family was like would leave. Because the two of them would be so like symbiotic with everything. Umm… And when grandma died, uh… he went to the funeral. She said, you know, we did the wake he didn't really say anything he stood in the line when people came, he thanked them for coming. Umm… And this was a family that was deeply religious umm… so they had, you know, talked about her being in heaven, so for kids that are rule driven that's sort of, you know, 'Okay, she's in heaven, but I'm good with that.' We're the ones that bring the emotional attachment into that or just attachment into that he's like fine, 'She's… she's in heaven them we're good to go,' right, you know, that's what we do, you know, when we die that's where we go, so that rule driven piece (inaudible) sort of got, right. Umm… However she's like and he didn't never… never shed a tear, never nothing saw thus crying and really, you know, never did anything. Then, they got home after the funeral, the internment, they went to a restaurant they had a little, you know, after, you know, event and then went home and when they got home, umm… he was in his room and she heard him in his room and he was packing, and she walked in and she goes 'Why are you packing?' Umm… You don't have to go back to school for another two weeks. You're not gonna school for two weeks, why are you packing? And he looks at her and he goes 'Well, somebody's got to stay with grandpa,' that's the empathy. That's… that's how he relays it. So understanding that piece of it that rapport building is critical and then behavioral momentum is nothing more than starting your day in those opportunities that are things that kids can do… do well unlike and then start to bring in maybe some of the things that are a little bit tougher. How many of you know from the time your kid gets up or your kid gets to school what kind of day you're gonna have? You can change that. And that's how you change? It is through behavioral momentum. You take those opportunities of things the kid loves or loves to do on your terms, don't let them dictate it, you see the face, you know how it's going, you create it, you do it and then you start to get into some of the things that they might not want to do because by setting in motion that good positive thing you can… you can refocus them and get them back on that good shift uh… because there are, you know, and these are the must have components that I look at in a program and I'm gonna because I've already talked about all of them umm… and I'm gonna end with this the last one but you have to be doing good communication. And I don't care if your kid is verbal or not, you need communication systems. You've gotta use pictures, you've gotta use gestures, you got to give that kid as many avenues to communicate as they possibly can and don't put all your eggs in that verbal basket because for some of you how many of your kids or verbal, yet don't really communicate all that well. There's a huge difference between verbal language and communication. And I can prompt pictures, and gestures, and signs and all kinds of other stuff, I can't prompt verbal language, I can't jump down a kid's throat and make him talk to me, but I can prompt all those other opportunities through systems. Umm… And you know if you want some really good material on that Future Horizons has some really good stuff on functional communication training umm… so if you look at their catalog. Umm… And then with sensory integration umm… you know, these kids are sensory, you know, nightmares a lot of times especially when they're little, so it's about that integration behavior, obviously play skills reinforcement social skills, we talked about that. But the last one is the biomedical piece umm… and I just urge the families here that umm… if you do any biomedical things, do it based on diagnosis because obviously if the kid has some kind of issue biomedically, I can't do anything as a behaviorist. I can't, you know, put a program together and make the kid change because they have a leaky gut. I can't go in and change an allergy that they might have. But if they have that diagnosis, they can get good medical treatment to change that and what it does and I'm gonna leave you with this because anything I do for a kid on the spectrum, bottom line is I'm looking to put them in a better position…
