00:00:05
PETER I once told my mother that I'd never met anyone that I felt was remotely similar to me. 

00:00:10
FIONA He did say to me once that, um, that he feels like people are talking a different language to him. 

00:00:20
JACQUI Luke says that at school, to him, it's like being a foreigner. 

00:00:30
MATTHEW Uh, when I was at primary school, it did upset me quite a lot that I wa-, didn't seem to be able to make very many friends. 

00:00:40
JANE KEECH He does occasionally have an odd little, um, interaction with another child, but the majority of the time he plays on his own. 

00:00:45
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN These people all have one thing in common, they have Asperger Syndrome. A condition at the more able end of the autistic spectrum. 

00:00:55
Asperger Syndrome: A Different Mind 

00:01:00
[music] 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN So we've been talking about extreme habitats... 

00:01:05
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN For a child with Asperger Syndrome, the classroom experience can be very different to that of other children. 

00:01:10
UNKNOWN Can anybody remember the name of a plant or an animal that lives in the polar regions? Chloe? 

00:01:15
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN In this program, we'll be identifying some of the features, which are seen in an extreme form in Asperger Syndrome. 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN The temperature can get up to 48? Celsius, so it's really, really hot and it's really dry, as well. 

00:01:30
hypersensitivity to noise 

00:01:35
[sil.] 

00:01:35
tendency to focus on small details 

00:01:35
difficulty decoding emotions and expressions 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN So let's have a look at Tom's painting. Here's the desert; you can see the sun beating down, looks really hot. There's sand everywhere, but there are a few plants and animals on here that are adapted to live in the desert. John, can you think of any plants or animals that live in the desert? John, did you hear me? What animals might live in the desert? John? John, you've not been concentrating all day, now will you pull your socks up and pay attention? 

00:02:05
literal understanding of language 

00:02:05
DR FIONA SCOTT Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge 

00:02:05
DR. FIONA SCOTT A lot of children who have Asperger Syndrome struggle in school. They struggle with their understanding; um, they have a very literal understanding of language. They struggle with their social interactions and, quite often, the school environment now makes it quite difficult for them to learn. And so we need to be able to identify them, so we can support them appropriately and help with their education and their psychological development and progress. 

00:02:30
[music] 

00:02:30
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Approximately 9 out of 10people with Asperger Syndrome are male. We're going to meet several people with Asperger Syndrome; first of all, Joe. 

00:02:45
[music] 

00:02:45
Joe is five. He was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome aged four. 

00:02:45
JOE Well, this here is called triceratops. It's got three horns; one small one on the beak and two on the frill. The frill is big and, and like a semi-circle. 

00:03:00
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Typically for a child with Asperger Syndrome, he has an intense special interest. Joe's is dinosaurs. 

00:03:05
obsessional, restricted interests 

00:03:05
JOE This is called iguanodon. It lived 144 to 135 million years ago. 

00:03:15
WENDY Joe's mother 

00:03:15
WENDY He has a hugely scientific mind. He likes classification and he likes things to be in the right place and in the right order. So, anything like dinosaur, where there, there is a lot of classification into different periods of time and into different groups of fa-, of dinosaurs, um, he likes that. 

00:03:35
JOE And very big toes. 

00:03:35
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN What Joe doesn't like, another very typical feature of Asperger Syndrome, is interacting with his peers. 

00:03:45
JOE Now it's your turn. 

00:03:45
prefers adults to peers 

00:03:45
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN This makes functioning in a class of 30 children extremely difficult. 

00:03:50
JOE I need to match flies or spiders. I'm gonna match spiders. 

00:03:55
JANE KEECH Joe's teacher 

00:03:55
JANE KEECH At the moment, Joe doesn't come to assembly with us in the morning. He finds it just too much to come into hall with such a large number of children. So, it works out quite well. Our assembly's first thing in the morning and that's the time when Joe has just his quiet time with his learning support assistant. Without her, he really couldn't manage in school. 

00:04:15
JANE KEECH It's a good game, isn't it? 

00:04:25
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Joe has his own separate work station in the classroom. 

00:04:25
JANE KEECH It has a screen around it, um, to cover up some of the distractions of the other children. 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:04:35
JANE KEECH Sometimes if he's feeling cross or worried or anxious about something, he'll go back. It's like a security thing for him really, um, and he, he tends to, sort of, know himself when he needs to go and have a bit of time on his own. Although he has his own workstation, he has a place at another table with a group of nine children and, more and more now, he will actually voluntarily go to work at the table with the other group of children. 

00:05:10
[sil.] 

00:05:10
JOE Look at him there. He's very unhappy. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN He is very, very unhappy. 

00:05:15
JOE I know, he's covered in straw. 

00:05:20
WENDY That's the biggest challenge for Joe, is interacting with other children. I do worry about that a lot, because he is socially isolated. And not from lack of, of opportunities, children approach Joe. I think his classmates have been fantastic. 

00:05:40
[sil.] 

00:05:45
WENDY He finds it extremely difficult to interrelate with other children and often, um, if he wants to talk to another child, he'll ask me to make the remark to the child or, 'Please, can you ask, uh, for the rubber?' or whatever it is, whatever small thing that he wants. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:00
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Children like Joe, with Asperger Syndrome, often stand out in the playground, because they don't join in with the other children. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN We're staying on the small playground today, because the big child-, the big children are on the play, big playground. 

00:06:15
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN To add to Joe's problems today, there's a change of plan at playtime. Children with Asperger Syndrome typically find any unexpected change in routine very upsetting. 

00:06:25
strong adherence to routine 

00:06:25
WENDY He lacks flexibility to a really large degree. It makes him very anxious if, if things aren't the way he thinks they should be. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Joe? Joe? 

00:06:35
unusual hand movements 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Joe does find the playground quite difficult. If he becomes anxious, he tends to flap his arms. It's been one of his targets to build up so that he actually goes out at playtime for five minutes, and he's now actually spending the whole of playtime outside. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN He doesn't really interact with the other children. He tends to make up his own little game. He finds the noise very difficult and, at times, he will spend a large part of the playtime with his hands over his ears. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, they've gone now. 

00:07:15
[sil.] 

00:07:15
WENDY I'm hoping, um, that Joe will find things easier as he gets older and learns more about how school works. Obviously, my big hope is that he'll make a friend, at least one friend, and that would be a wonderful thing to happen. 

00:07:35
[music] 

00:07:35
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Many children with Asperger Syndrome do learn to cope better as they get older. Charlie's difficulties have become less severe in the past couple of years. 

00:07:45
Charlie is ten. He was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome aged six. 

00:07:50
[music] 

00:07:50
CHARLIE Asperger Syndrome, uh, it is something that makes me different from other people in some ways. And it's the, and it's why I sometimes might be a little, like, moody, sometimes. 

00:08:05
CHARLIE Can I go inside? 

00:08:05
FIONA In a minute. 

00:08:10
FIONA Charlie's mother 

00:08:10
FIONA He was diagnosed when he was, I think, about six and a half, but before then, um, when he was three, I was concerned cause he wasn't really talking and he wouldn't play with the other children. There were, he wouldn't sleep. I was constantly asked to leave places; Mom's and Tots, and play group, and nursery, and wherever we went, there was always a situation where he'd hurt somebody, or he'd upset somebody, or he'd behaved inappropriately. 

00:08:35
strong interest in collecting things 

00:08:40
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Like Joe, Charlie has obsessive interests. One of his latest is collecting stones. 

00:08:45
CHARLIE I have an extremely vast collection of, um, ranging from very common stones to semiprecious to precious stones, some that are rarer than diamonds. I have them in my possession. This here used to be a wand of quartz, which is what you'd call a stick, which looks a bit like a pencil going in, this part here, like a pencil going in. It was left to grow and grow and it's grown out and so, in there, this wand of quartz goes through there, but it's grown out into a formation of quartz. 

00:09:20
FIONA He's completely controlled by whatever his obsession is, as far as spending money and places he wants to go and material he's prepared to read, so it's very restricting and very controlling; not just for him, but for everybody around. 

00:09:35
JO BOLTON Charlie, just go and sit down if you've had a drink, please. 

00:09:40
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN After a problematic start at school, he manages without extra support. But there are still some difficulties. 

00:09:50
JO BOLTON Charlie's teacher 

00:09:50
JO BOLTON Well, I, I have sat Charlie by himself recently. After we've done the SATs exams, I've left the desks as they are and he's been sitting on his own, because, um, Charlie does sometimes irritate whoever he sits next to or he distracts them. He used to have problems with calling out a lot and he still does that, but much less so than he used to. Um, and sometimes when he answers a question, he goes on and on and on. So, instead of just giving a, a line answer or a one word answer that I'm looking for and the other children realize I'm looking for, he'll explain it in absolutely massive scientific detail or something. 

00:10:25
CHARLIE To move on to the next level, answer, answer this problem, that there are, at, at the moment, we have 420 children, we need enough pickles we, for, for...(crosstalk) 

00:10:40
JO BOLTON Good. Link it to... 

00:10:45
JO BOLTON You have to, kind of, cut him short because you're trying to move the lesson forward. 

00:10:50
[music] 

00:10:50
JO BOLTON Charlie's main difficulties are probably socially, to be honest. And when he's, uh, in, you know, in the playground and things like that, and though there isn't really a problem when he's in the playground, he worries that there's going to be and he feels this excluded and he's been known to say that he feels that he hasn't got his own, sort of, special group of friends. 

00:11:15
[music] 

00:11:15
FIONA I think when he tries to interact with children, he likes to do it on his terms. It's the social skills and it's also the unsaid words. There are just a lot of things that you don't realize that you don't actually say, mannerisms, facial expressions and Charlie finds that quite difficult. 

00:11:35
JO BOLTON One of Charlie's other problems is that, when we do things that are different to normal and we upset his routine, then he gets worried. And all the bad aspects of his behavior do tend to come out. So, he might rock more, or he might lose his concentration more, or he might put his head down on the desk more. 

00:11:50
strong adherence to routine 

00:11:55
CHARLIE I don't mind changes too much, but I just don't really like them. I mean, sometimes they're okay, but if we're going to do math and we end up doing lectures, then I find it difficult to concentrate. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:15
FIONA I think the school that he's at, at the moment, have coped really well, because it's not just his problem, it's the class problem and it's a problem for the teacher. 

00:12:20
JO BOLTON Well done. Tia's (sp) found my spelling mistake. 

00:12:25
FIONA And they've done really well to get him to conform and, and to do all the social things that are expected of him. I've got a year till Charlie transfers to secondary school, um, but I'm already concerned about it. I can't imagine the other journey to school on a bus, um, changing from place to place, reading the time table, not being picked on, um, I can't imagine any of it happening without a huge amount of distress for, for Charlie and, obviously, for me. So, it's in my mind all the time really. 

00:13:05
[music] 

00:13:05
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN After the more nurturing environment of primary school, children with Asperger Syndrome, like Luke, can find many aspects of secondary school a challenge. 

00:13:15
[music] 

00:13:15
Luke is fourteen. He was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome aged eight. 

00:13:20
LUKE I'm getting a new organizer... 

00:13:20
JACQUI Luke's mother 

00:13:25
JACQUI Luke's been to two secondary schools. The first one after he came out of primary school. He went to a state secondary school, um, and basically he was bullied, you know, to such an extent that it just wasn't workable. Eventually, he was physically chased out of school; he was batted in the street. So, I just removed him from that day. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
no interest in small talk 

00:13:50
LUKE I think this school is better than my last school because you're, sort of, left to your own devices, because, uh, you get to, like, go in the IT room, go in the library and you don't have to interact with everybody else. AS people have difficulties with small talk. That's generally what teenagers do. They just talk about the weather, or what music they've, like, been listening to lately. And I just find that hard to cope with. 

00:14:20
JACQUI Luke's never actually had any friends. Over the years, he's always been on his own being quite happy. He says that he's quite happy on his own and he certainly seems it. 

00:14:30
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Part of the problem with social interaction for people with Asperger Syndrome, is that they have difficulty reading facial expressions. 

00:14:40
difficulty decoding emotions and expressions 

00:14:40
LUKE It's really hard to find the subtle differences between expressions. And a lot of people seem to do this naturally, but with AS people, it's a lot harder and you have to learn from memory. And as people face's change all the time and people's appearances change, it's really hard to learn everybody's face separately. 

00:15:05
[sil.] 

00:15:05
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Added to this is the fact that some children with Asperger Syndrome find eye contact difficult. 

00:15:10
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY Luke's English teacher 

00:15:10
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY When I first met Luke, I knew that I had a pupil in my class who suffered with Asperger Syndrome. And I realized that eye contact was one of the, the primary points and, to be honest, as soon as I met Luke, I knew he was the one with Asperger Syndrome. Sometimes it can be disconcerting, the fact that he doesn't make eye contact with you, especially when you're trying to give him instructions. 

00:15:30
poor eye contact 

00:15:30
LUKE When I'm looking at somebody talking to me, usually I get unco-, uh, I actually get uncomfortable by, like, their eyes and just, like, the feeling of them boring into me. 

00:15:45
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY ...the satirical characters, the characters from Macbeth... 

00:15:45
LUKE I usually look at the mouth. That's one of the best tricks that I found out so far. Although it does give you a, sort of, dazed look. 

00:15:55
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY Think about some of the writers that perhaps that you enjoy reading. If you don't read, then now is the time to start. Or... 

00:16:00
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY Luke can sometimes be disorganized, particularly when it comes to homework. Trying to get him to write things down when you ask him to is sometimes a very difficult task. So, I have to stand over him when it comes to homework. I have to say to him, 'You need to note this down, Luke.' 

00:16:20
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY Shh, uh, you're not going anywhere. You write it down in your diaries, so you don't forget. Get your diaries out please. 

00:16:30
LUKE Usually I get distracted by the bell as it, like, rings really loud, like, right in your ear. I don't hear, like, anything the teacher is saying. A lot of the time I miss the homework completely and, I come home, um, thinking I've got no homework whatsoever and then I'll look in someone else's homework diary and find out that they've got, like, four pieces of homework and I haven't a clue that they were even there. 

00:16:55
DAWN SHAUGHNESSY You may go. Off you go. 

00:17:00
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Luke's next challenge is to get to his history class. 

00:17:05
[music] 

00:17:05
LUKE I've always had difficulty since primary school, um, finding my way from one class to the next, because you're, like, moving, like, every 40 minutes. I get a lot of people being annoyed at me for following them. 

00:17:35
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN One thing Luke hasn't learned to cope with at school is sports lessons. 

00:17:40
LUKE People with AS have problems with noise, social interaction, uh, teamwork, everybody running around like complete chaos. And with games and PE mixing all of these together, then it just makes both of them complete hell. 

00:18:00
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN The school now allows him to miss sports lessons. It's also timetabled special needs classes for Luke. Today they're working on language. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN We're going to leave that for the moment and look at idioms that you were working on last week. 

00:18:15
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN People with Asperger Syndrome don't readily understand idioms and metaphors. Language needs to be very clear and concise. 

00:18:25
literal understanding of language 

00:18:25
LUKE AS people always understand things very literally because say if someone says, for example, I'll give you another bite of the cherry, then, uh, they wouldn't know that that means they'll give them another chance. So, for example, a cherry is too small to have more than one bite anyway so... 

00:18:50
[sil.] 

00:18:50
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN The school also allows Luke to go to the IT room at lunchtime, rather than having to socialize with the other children. 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:05
LUKE I don't know, really, why I borrow a computer. It seemed to be, like, easier to deal with, so I just like going there at lunchtime and it's a lot easier than, like, mingling with all the kids. 

00:19:15
JACQUI Luke and a lot of children with Asperger Syndrome try really, really hard to fit in at school. And, um, they actually come across very well and manage very well to do this. But it takes so much, so much out of them that, that, literally, the second they come through the door, its they blow a fuse. Luke, he's very, very moody. I just have to let him go onto the computer and just slowly process the events of the day. 

00:19:45
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Computers are definitely Luke's obsession. 

00:19:50
LUKE After school I usually spend around seven, eight hours on the computer. The only drawback is that it annoys my mom and my family so much that it just, like, drives them mad. 

00:20:05
JACQUI He doesn't speak about anything else. He doesn't think about anything else at all at home. And an obsession is something that takes over your life and it definitely does with Luke. 

00:20:15
JACQUI You would think that because Luke is a member of a big family that he's got the perfect opportunity for lots of social interaction and socializing but, in reality, it doesn't happen that way. He's still isolated at home. At mealtimes, if I manage to get him off the computer, then he just sits, sits on his own, sits quiet, eats his meals, looks at everybody as if they're from another planet. And, ping, the elastic pulls him back to the computer again. 

00:20:45
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Among people with Asperger Syndrome, there's a wide variation in the difficulties they experience. So, how is it diagnosed? Today, Dr. Fiona Scott is diagnosing a nine year old boy. 

00:21:05
DR. FIONA SCOTT A diagnosis typically takes about a day and it involves a two to three hour developmental history interview with the parent, an hour one to one observation with the child, typically in their home, and then a morning or an afternoon observing the child in school with their peer group and in the classroom. Right now I'm heading to see a family in their home to do an observation and an interview with the parent. 

00:21:30
[music] 

00:21:35
DR. FIONA SCOTT Would Stephen ever talk with you just to participate in a social chat or small talk? 

00:21:40
CHRIS Stephen's mother 

00:21:40
CHRIS No, I find it very difficult having a conversation with Stephen. I always have to start, start a conversation and then, unless it was about his interests, um, such as, Pokemon or, or Lego, at the time, you couldn't just have a normal chit-chat conversation; certainly not the same as his friends. 

00:22:00
DR. FIONA SCOTT Has Stephen ever seemed over-sensitive to noise at all? 

00:22:05
CHRIS Stephen dislikes the noise of the vacuum cleaner, um, food mixer; he doesn't like loud sounds. He's easily, in class, he's easily di-, distracted by noises, such as, a dog barking outside. Um, at parties, he will cover his ears up, um, to an entertainer or to loud music. 

00:22:25
DR. FIONA SCOTT We try to make the diagnoses as objective as possible, but it gets very difficult and most people that you talk to would say, ultimately, it's down to clinical experience, because there's no easy test for Asperger Syndrome. So, you have to piece together all the information you get from the school observation, and the parent interview and observing the child. And build up a jigsaw and see if that fits what you're understanding and experience of Asperger Syndrome is. 

00:22:50
DR. FIONA SCOTT What do you like doing here? 

00:22:50
STEPHEN 

00:22:55
STEPHEN Play. 

00:22:55
DR. FIONA SCOTT What do you play at? 

00:23:00
STEPHEN Play in the garden sometimes. 

00:23:00
DR. FIONA SCOTT Mm-hmm. What kind of things do you do? 

00:23:00
STEPHEN I don't know. 

00:23:05
DR. FIONA SCOTT What you see with Stephen, which is typical to Asperger Syndrome, is difficulties with eye contact; particularly with people he doesn't know very well. He has problems with pretend play. 

00:23:15
DR. FIONA SCOTT Which one do you want to be? Which one do you...(crosstalk) 

00:23:15
STEPHEN I don't know. 

00:23:15
DR. FIONA SCOTT How about if you'd be the wrestler? 

00:23:20
STEPHEN No. 

00:23:20
DR. FIONA SCOTT No? What about the lady? 

00:23:25
STEPHEN Definitely not. 

00:23:25
DR. FIONA SCOTT Definitely not. 

00:23:25
DR. FIONA SCOTT He finds it difficult to talk about his feelings and to describe emotions and feelings clearly. And he uses quite unusual language when he tries to explain what happy is, for example. 

00:23:40
DR. FIONA SCOTT What does a happy face look like? 

00:23:45
STEPHEN Um, lips up. 

00:23:45
DR. FIONA SCOTT Lips are up? 

00:23:50
STEPHEN Like this. Not this. 

00:23:50
DR. FIONA SCOTT What's your best friend called? 

00:23:55
STEPHEN Andrew. 

00:23:55
DR. FIONA SCOTT Ah, does he go to the same school as you? 

00:23:55
STEPHEN Used to, but then I moved. 

00:24:00
DR. FIONA SCOTT Oh. What's different about someone who's a friend and someone you just go to school with? 

00:24:05
STEPHEN I don't really know. 

00:24:10
DR. FIONA SCOTT Ah, do you think all of the children in your class are friends? 

00:24:15
STEPHEN Definitely not. 

00:24:15
DR. FIONA SCOTT No? What makes some of them not friends? 

00:24:20
STEPHEN Keep getting into fights. 

00:24:20
DR. FIONA SCOTT Oh, dear. 

00:24:20
DR. FIONA SCOTT He has problems, as well, understanding friendships and being able to very clearly say what a friend is and how that's different to someone that he just knows. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:35
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Stephen does receive a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:45
DR. FIONA SCOTT Recent research has really suggested that there are about one in 200 people who have Asperger Syndrome, which is much higher than we used to think and it's a substantial number of children and adults who need support within our community. 

00:25:00
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Peter is a 22 year old with Asperger Syndrome. His special passion is juggling.

00:25:10
PETER I'm very interested in juggling, at the moment. I have been for about four or five years now. I spend a long time every day practicing and up to four, five hours a day, depending on how much time I have available. Well, there are some mathematical aspects to juggling. Um, you can juggle patterns with different throw heights, which mathematically is described in terms of the timing in which you throw. And I have some examples of some, some calculations I've done here to, to find new patterns with, with different throw heights.

PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Both Peter and his twin brother, Matthew, have Asperger Syndrome. But unlike Joe, Charlie and Luke, the twins went through school without a diagnosis. 

00:26:00
MATTHEW 

00:26:00
MATTHEW My time at school was, uh, quite difficult at some stages. Uh, in primary school, uh, it, it was a lot, it was a lot more difficult because, uh, chil-, chil-, children are a lot more crueler at that age, obviously. I got, I got bullied quite a lot. 

00:26:20
PETER I did feel from quite a young age that I was very different from the other children, in some undefinable, indescribable way. 

00:26:30
MATTHEW The teachers tried to treat me, uh, very assertively, you know, they would often shout at me or send me out of the room, you know, if they, if they felt that I, I, I wasn't contributing or I, they felt, because I was, I looked very unemotional that I, that I was being cold. 

00:26:45
PETER I think that some of the teachers thought I was trying to make their life difficult. I think they thought I was being stubborn or misunderstanding them on purpose. And some of them, a few of them were a little adversarial. 

00:27:00
MATTHEW I think if the teachers had been aware that I'd had a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome they might have been a little more patient with me, treated me a little bit more gently and explained things, uh, just, like, a bit more carefully. 

00:27:15
PROFESSOR SIMON BARON-COHEN Despite their problems at school, Matthew and Peter did very well academically and have recently graduated from University. 

00:27:20
DR. FIONA SCOTT A lot of these children are very, very good in a lot of areas, such as, uh, computer programming, in, um, mathematical understanding and physics. So, it's not necessarily the case that having Asperger Syndrome is a detriment to a child, as long as the support is appropriate to help them. 

00:27:40
WENDY I think Joe's generation is really lucky to have had early diagnosis and it means that whatever difficulties we have at school, hopefully, he won't feel guilty, feel like he's failing, have all those difficulties, which I'm sure would lead to depression later on. 

00:27:55
LUKE When I was first diagnosed with AS, I mostly think I felt relieved because, um, all through my life I've been called, well, I could write a list for you, if you want; I've been called a freak, a geek and a nerd and any other name you can think of, but, including a few which I'm not going to mention here, and it was just good to know that I wasn't, like, any of these and it was just, there was actually a name for it and it wasn't all just me.
