A RESEARCHED-BASED COUPLE TREATMENT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

JOHN GOTTMAN, PhD & JULIE GOTTMAN, PhD

JOHN GOTTMAN So I was surprised to see how little hair I have on that picture, but I… I… I recently been able to… to get the connection for Donald Trump's hair dresser. So I'm hoping that in the future I'm gonna look like I have a lot more than that. So uh… we wanna talk about the study that we've done in our laboratory on treating domestic violence and I'd like to give you some idea about it and how we've struggled with it umm… we being doing research on domestic violence uh… for the past 30 years. And as you know this is a worldwide problem. Every… every country on the planet for which there's data and the World Health Organization UNESCO has been gathering data. But part of the problem is it's very hard to really get good information about domestic violence. Umm… So there's literature what we're family uh… researchers actually call people up and ask them about domestic violence, umm… 40% of was calls people hang up, all right? So there's… you get a very biased literature and when you use this survey method. And also people really feel a lot of shame and… and really underreport. And they're also afraid that if they talk about it that, you know, they may in for uh… some violence as a result of it. So we know that this is… these are underestimates and the UNESCO report this is kind of some international data. By the way Canadians are little bit more violent than we are, all right? It's interesting. So uh… so friends of ours who live in Canada uh… recently described uh… Canada as a nice apartment on top of the meth lab, you know. And since the election I'd have to agree with them, but you can see that you know, really all over uh… the world this is really uh… a huge problem. And umm… and some of the countries in which we've done teaching and research like Turkey, umm… where the people who hosted us, did uh… a very large study of 22,000 women in Turkey, they found that domestic violence occurred in over 60% of uh… when they interviewed the women. So this is another slide that I thought was kind of interesting, this is the proportion of women aged 15 to 49 Who say that a husband is justified in beating his wife, 90% in Jordan, 81% in Ethiopia. I think this is really quite remarkable. Well, so let's try to understand domestic violence a little bit and, you know, and certainly, you know, we're not claiming that we understand all of it, but Michael Johnson uh… identified two kinds of domestic violence. And one kind is called situational domestic violence and the other character logical domestic violence. By the way only slides are available on the website on the brief therapy website, you know, we gave them to the booth Therapy Conference. So if you have them, you know, write to them and they can… they can send you all of the… all of the slides. Now… so you know, what are these two types? Well, you know, Johnson said, you know, in the study of violence we really have two very bias literatures. One, is this family survey research, you know, where 40% of the people hang up, right? And even the people they don't hang up are really feeling very inhibited to talk about what's really true. And then we have a literature that comes out of women's shelters, that's primarily a clinical literature and uh… you know, and this is… this is really based on absolutely no data at all, but very important clinical impressions have come out of this. So we get a biased sample as well there. I wanna talk a little bit of that. Neil Jacobsen and uh… I unfortunately Neil died in the year 2000, uh… but we spent nine years looking at it domestic violence and wrote this book uh… when men batter women. And in that study uh… was a nine year longitudinal study, and we had four groups of couples, happy nonviolent couples, unhappy nonviolent, and then we had situational domestic violence couples. I'll define what… what that is in a moment because it really emerged from the research and characterological domestic violence. These were only male perpetrators. We now know there… there are female character logically violent women as well. Umm… And part of what we discovered was that uh… none of the situationally violent couples, ever escalator in nine years graduated to becoming characterological. We also identified two kinds of characterological domestic violence perpetrators, and we called one Pitbull, and the other cobras. And they were very different from one another and they were different in a lot of ways, they are different physiologically as well as behaviorally. The Pitbull type of characterologically violent male uh… is very jealous, and very insecure, and fears abandonment. And so this is the kind of guy who uh… for example one of our subjects put uh… chalk mark on his wife's rear tire and also on the driveway and in the morning, and… and he did that in the morning when he came back from work, he saw the card been moved. And so he asked his wife where she had been? She had been to the grocery store, but she forgot and she said Nowhere. And he said bullshit, you know, who are you screwing? And beat her up. You know, so that's… that's kind of the uh… one kind that is really sort of awesome Nicole the borderline male. Very insecure, very afraid of abandonment. The other type is much more of a psychopath, the cobra and what characterized the cobra and the reason we call them cobras was that when we first we're doing the research on them and observe them, interacting with their wives they were very escalated and when I ran back into the control room and looked at the physiology, the physiology is actually below baseline. So they were lowering their physiological arousal and yet acting as if, you know, they were very escalated physiologically. So very much like a cobra which is the animal is only dangerous when it stops moving. These Cobras are like that. They were not worried about being abandoned. They were really unable to accept any influence. So let's talk about what this characterological violence is like and… and what these… what these perpetrators are like. In characterological domestic violence there's a clear victim and a clear perpetrator. And the perpetrator externalize blame and usually is elevated on scales of antisocial behavior. And when we analyze the… the most violent argument and get play-by-plays of that and the most recent violent argument we find in doing sequence analysis that there's nothing that the victim is done to either initiate or terminate the violence. And the perpetrator also believes that the woman's harsh words justify his violence. Umm… In fact, the way we recruited these… these couples was that the men brought their women into the study and said look what she does, look what I have to deal with and look how she makes me be violent. So that was a very strong belief in characterological domestic violence. And, you know, as I mentioned there are these two types. The pupils are very jealous and fear of abandonment. The cobras dropped their physiological arousal and seemed to fake the escalation. The pupils are very domineering in their behavior, whereas the cobras are very belligerent in their behavior. Okay. Situational domestic violence is very different umm… the violence is reciprocal, there's no clear perpetrator or a victim, and both partners are taking responsibility for the violence. They… they both think that violence is wrong. So a coupled that is experiencing situational domestic violence really is very upset about having had these violent episodes. Uh… Both partners umm… really, you know, think that they shouldn't do it, and they want help and terminating this violence. Usually the violence hasn't caused any serious internal organ damage or broken bones. So… so there's less violence, it's less dangerous. And both people, both partners show remorse. And usually this is caused by a conflict that has escalated out of control. And as we studied these kinds of couples for nine years, we expected some of them will become character logically violent. None of them did. Now here's an interesting thing uh… the work that's done by Leonard just to give you an idea of how umm… how we underestimate the rates of domestic violence. Uh… Leonard found that 36% of all newlywed couples in the United States have had a violent altercation in their relationship before they marry, 36% and that was reported in 1999. And in 2011 this… this finding was replicated. So this situational domestic violence is pretty rampant. Now what proportion of all domestic violence is situational and what proportion is character logical? And in our research 80% of all domestic violence was situational. And only 20% was characterological. Now what you read about in the newspapers, you know, these huge episodes where somebody, you know, uses a gun or a knife and the police are called in and the police, you know, may be injured or killed. Those very dramatic episodes are the characterological domestic violence. Most of the victims who are in shelters are victims of characterological domestic violence, but it's only 20% of all violence. So characterological incident even though they get the media attention umm… they actually make up the… the vast majority. Now here's another interesting fact in most of the states in the United States a couple's approach to treating domestic violence cannot be used, there are laws against it or their policies by the district attorney in the courts that mandate that only the male will go to all male treatment groups and the fear is that actually if this… if… if they don't do that there'll be blaming the woman and the woman is… is assumed to be the innocent victim in all domestic violence. However it isn't true in situational domestic violence. Research actually shows that if you look at who throws the first punch or through who throws the first object, 71% of the time it's the woman who does this. Now domestic violence happens a lot more when women are pregnant. So the Center for Disease Control estimates that 300,000 pregnant women in the United States are abused every year. And one third of all domestic violence starts during pregnancy. And pregnant women who are abused really are likely to undergo very serious complications, miscarriage, High blood pressure, premature birth and the quality of the intrauterine environment has a huge effect on the development of the baby, development of the fetus, cortisol, really crosses the intrauterine barrier. So any kind of domestic violence and especially even… even conflict winds up having a big impact. Pregnant women who experienced domestic violence are more likely to have a baby who is stillborn. And 12% of all maternal deaths are caused by domestic violence. In the United Kingdom 25% of babies have been estimated to be at risk for infinite abuse due to domestic violence, so the… the violence is not just directed at the woman also directed at the baby. Well, umm… in our lab umm… Julie and I when we first started collaborating we were studying 130 newlyweds in an apartment laboratory and we studied them as many of them got pregnant and we followed them for three years in the baby's life. And… and found that 67% of this representative sample of newlyweds in Seattle experienced a dramatic drop in relationship happiness in the first three years of the baby's life. So think about that, you know, this blissful event of a baby entering a relationship, the majority of couples experienced this as a non blissful event, not only is there a decrease in relationship satisfaction, but if you look at how the couples talk about conflict and observers are blind to whether the couple has had a baby or not. And they're just… they're just score in the conflict, there is much more hostility that builds during the first year of the baby's life. And these are nonviolent couples. Okay? And not only is it the case that umm… that hostility increases and the couple relationship, but that is transferred to the baby, that violence is transferred, that hostility is transferred to the baby. And that… and it causes problems in infant emotional and cognitive development. So here we're talking about a nonviolent sample and just following this… the sample as a couples go through pregnancy and the birth of the baby, and in the majority of families where there's a baby, there's this increasing hostility that compromises the baby's emotional and intellectual development. Now for one third of the couples that didn't happen. So Julie and I designed this workshop, Baby Makes Three, and it turns out that in two days actually 10 hours, five hours a day of a workshop, we can eliminate this drop in relationship happiness for almost 80% of couples. So in two days we can prevent this, we can create an intervention that doesn't just have a half a standard deviation effect size which is typical of all family therapy couples therapy, including emotionally focused therapy we can have a four standard deviation effect size. So 80% of couples almost in two days we're eliminating this drop and relationship happiness. We're eliminating the increase in hostility and the baby didn't take the workshop, but as we follow the Baby, these babies, these parents took the workshop develop language earlier and they have higher vagal tone, better ability to self sooth, they laugh and smile more and cry less then babies in the control group who are, whose parents didn't take the workshop. So we can make a big impact on this. But with lower income couples there's a greater challenge, uh… the fragile families study would which took place in 16 cities in the United States found that actually this whole categorization of unwed mothers and we used to call him broken families actually 82% of the time there is the father of the baby as romantically involved with the mother at the time of the baby's birth. So you're really dealing with couples uh… in most of these cases. So lower-income moms who were on welfare the fathers in the shadows because it's… you know, it's punitive to say that, you know, there is a father there that's giving her money. But in this… in this fragile family study there are very high on the comorbidities domestic violence, drugs addiction, incarceration. And so 85% of these couples break up by the time the baby's one-year-old. So with lowering income couples we have these additional challenges and as we've done pilot work these couples really want to stay together. They wanna work on the relationship particularly when there's a baby on the way. And what makes fathers stay in the relationship? Is when there's low conflict with mother and high intimacy. And that's what makes them stay. That's the secret to avoiding baby's growing up without a father. It's very simple secret, but how do we make it happen? And it turns out actually father's absence and there's a very large research literature on this and developmental psychology is the children really are hurt when the father isn't there children more likely be raised in poverty, higher high-school drop-out rates, more risk-taking criminal behavior, more likely to become teen parents, uh… incarceration addiction and an unemployment. So father's absence is pretty important. Okay. So let's talk about the treatment of domestic violence. And currently every single treatment of domestic violence that has been studied in randomized clinical trial is ineffective and in fact a meta analysis by Julia Babcock who was a student of both Neil Jacobsen and myself and it is an award-winning researcher at the University of Houston. She's really one of the leading scientists studying domestic violence. In her metanalysis she found every intervention including the Duluth Model which is very commonly used have an effect size that is less than just one arrest, effect sizes of 0.01 and 0.12. In other words 5% of the treated population is being helped, 95% ineffective. This is every treatment for domestic violence, however the politics are that these ineffective treatments are mandated by law in thirty 31 in the Union, either mandated by law or by policy. And in fact when we try to do research using a couple's approach many, many agencies will refuse to cooperate with us, the politics are unbelievable and trying to do good research on this. And people will not accept the research literature that there are two kinds of domestic violence for example. And as we mentioned if you want to read a really good book on domestic violence Donald Dutton was a Canadian umm… wrote a book called The domestic assault of women, and research shows that women are violent. Well, we know women are violent, domestic violence occurs among lesbians and we know that in research, in middle school and high school, you know, females are as likely to be bullies as males are, they're just different in the way they're violent. So what are we saying? There's two kinds of violence. But can we… can we actually screen out this character logical domestic violence? And the answer is, yes. We've created a scale that allows us to screen this out very well and it has three parts to it. One, is the amount and type of violence. So characterological domestic violence is much more violent. Second, it induces fear and situational domestic violence people are not afraid of their partner, neither person. And also in characterological domestic violence, the violence is used to control and dominate the partner. Not only to get them to be afraid, but to control them and make them do the things they want. For example, there's sexual coercion. Now the intimate justice scale is another scale that is we also found to be almost as good as our scale. Umm… This a little bit of underreporting in the intimate justice scale compared to our scale. So this next slide is almost unreadable, but it's kind of uh… when you get a copy of the slideshow, you'll see that, you know, we can effectively screen out in this process characterological domestic violence. Okay. Now, so we can screen out, and we can find… we can identify the couples that are situationally violent. Now here's a methodology slide, so what I want to say is that in this research we… you cannot rely on self-report data because first of all people are ashamed to talk about violence. So the pre-therapy data looks really much better than it is. You need multiple assessment methods, you have to use archival police data to see whether there are 911 calls and that's declined. You also have to observe and see if the nature of the interaction is changed because in domestic violence, what's going on as much war hostility that's escalated. Have you had an impact in your intervention on the way people deal with conflict? And also physiology what escalates these conflicts and gets into the violent is people are going into fighter flight physiologically, heart rates are increasing, blood pleasure, blood velocity is increasing. So this is our theory of about situational domestic violence, only situational. We believe that there are three causes of it. The first is the lack of social skills in dealing with conflict. Now there's an enormous amount of evidence that shows that this is the case and the next slide we'll talk a little bit about that, but the other thing is that there is also an enormous lack of skill in dealing with intimacy with dealing with how to get close emotionally to somebody you love? It's not just about conflict, it's also about connection, and talking about feelings, talking about emotion. And the third part is physiological arousal is out of control. Okay. What's the evidence of skills deficit among domestic violence, situational domestic violence? And as we've done research on this we found that in fact, you know, they are very bad at handling conflict, they start conflict aggressively, they're pointing their finger at their partner, they're using the four horsemen of the apocalypse, they're using criticism, defensiveness, contempt and stonewalling much more. In a sample of almost 12,000 military personnel umm… Merrill Disco was the best predictor of domestic violence. So for every 20% increase in marital conflict, it was… it was almost a 102% increase in domestic violence. And compare it to unhappy nonviolent couples, these are couples who already unhappy. Right. So they're already escalated in their conflict. When the situational domestic violence there's… there's even more of these four horsemen. More… more anger out of control, more criticism, more contempt, more escalation, much more negative effect. And what (inaudible) and I discovered was that in all of these conflicts when interviewed people about what happened, how the violence occurred? None of these people have a way of withdrawing from one another of saying, you know, "Stop, I'm out of here, let's take a break." That just didn't happen in the violent. It happened in the unhappy couples, there was a… there was a withdrawal ritual, but not in violence occur. By the way on Dan O'Leary at Stony Brook found that 67% of all couples in couples therapy had been violent with one another, but most therapists don't assess for domestic violence, they don't use the conflict tactics scale or any of our scales. So if you don't know, if you don't ask you won't know. And most of these couples that you're seeing are probably situationally violent. Okay. So the thing I want to say is that if you look at couples therapy in general, there have only been two dismantling studies, two studies that have looked at the components of couples therapy and we did one of them and Neil Jacobsen did… did another. And it turns out that both these studies you don't get lasting change unless you change both conflict and intimacy, friendship and intimacy. You have to change both. Okay, those are two dismantling studies. And it really speaks to and we have a slide later on, and you do brief therapy with these couples. And most couple therapies are not bad at dealing with conflict from any kind of perspective so (inaudible) and the other ones, there… they're okay dealing with conflict, but they're not very good at dealing with friendship and intimacy. Okay. So can a couples intervention work? Well, there is really a study that is the pioneer study in this area and it was done by Sandra stiff and Eric McCollin. And they showed that a group intervention for couples experiencing situational domestic violence. Now was unclear how they screened, but they… you know, they did serve a clinical screening, they found that they got recidivism and violence and there was no umm… increase in risk at one-year follow-up. So that's pretty good. I mean, think of that there isn't a single study that is effective in treating domestic violence, beyond one arrest. Okay, that's the meta analysis and here's a couples intervention that works and they work from a solution focused perspective. They screened out character logical patterns, they… they didn't do it very systematically. Umm… So it's kinda hard to replicate their methods, but they use a solution focused approach umm… and get very good results. Now there are problems with the study umm… especially because only a third of their couples will lower-income and those small samples and the screening tool is not clear so it's hard to know how to how to do it. You need sort of a way of screening, but we have that now. And the intervention wasn't skill based solution a based, uh… it was solution based and they decided to not talk about emotions, which is kind of puzzling to me because really what you see when you do research on these couples is negative emotion is out of control. Okay. Now there are some challenges that come from this and Julie is gonna take it from here. 

00:30:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay. Okay. So first of all umm… one thing I really wanna say and I very much encourage you to think about is that uh… folks who have money are not the only people, who deserve to have couples therapy. Right? They're not the only people who need couples therapy and so when we were invited uh… to participate in a national study uh… put on by the administration of children and families and sponsored by a policy group, a social policy group in Washington DC, named Mathematica. Umm… We gladly agreed and what that meant is that we had to create some kind of program that would work for lower income couples, what they wanted to do was create some kind of curriculum that would really help couples who had very little money, could not afford therapy, were coming to social service agencies in some of the poorest of the states around the country, poorest of the communities. And I had done a lot of work uh… with couples in poverty, uh… people in poverty, and we… John and I put our heads together to try and figure out so how can we reach out to these people? How can we touched these people? How can we give them information? In such a way that it wouldn't turn them off. We were also looking at a group therapy model, so a couples group model where couples would come in to an agency of some sort, there would be two facilitators, they would meet for about two hours or so every week, and what could we give them? So how many of you, just raise your hands, how many of you have worked with very low-income couples? Oh, God bless you. That's wonderful, that's great to know. So as you well know most of those people have had terrible experiences in school, right? Most of them have felt judged, certainly judged by society. They've thought uh… they're thought of as lazy, they're thought of as out of control, uh… disorganized and so on. So did we wanna create a curriculum in which there was a classroom setting in which they would sit, the way you guys are sitting? And receive information from the gods above? What do you think? How many of you think that was the way we want to do it? Very good, keep your hands down. So you're right. So what we needed to do? Is we wanted to create a curriculum first of all because this is part of a research study, it needed to be applied, it needed to be replicable, right? So that anybody could do it. We wanted to teach information and skills, but at the same time we knew that these people wouldn't be coming back week after week for us, even though our knowledge is God like, they wouldn't come back for us, we're cute, we're adorable, we're really smart, but forget it that's not why they come back. They would come back for each other, right? So we wanted to create a sense of community within these groups some way to connect them to gather, to be close together. So that they could learn, but they could also have the time and the freedom to really connect with one another. We wanted to allow for spontaneity and we really needed to train facilitators to be respectful, respectful no matter who was talking to not shame anybody, and to be very, very aware of that very sensitive to that we wanted to give couples a sense of safety, we wanted to give them a sense of pride. So how were we gonna do all that? But combined that what we… with what we thought could work that was our challenge. So here's what we did and in this first study it's called loving couples living children. We created a curriculum that included 42 modules, there were about 21 core modules, which is what we really got to teach, and here's the way these worked, they would present skills, they would present interventions, but what they would also really center on is creating community amongst these small groups of couples with a couple of facilitators, otherwise we knew we would lose them, they wouldn't come back, right? So this group called Mathematica and another group called MDRC conducted randomized clinical trials of this curriculum that we created in seven states. And here's what we did, John and I designed it, then I went to uh… I don't know, seven different states and taught it to facilitators in these family therapy agencies who would run the groups as part of this research study, and there were over 3,000 couples in these groups. So some of the states this took place in was Florida, Alabama, Georgia, The Bronx, that's a state, right? Uh… Let's see where else? Maryland, right. Baltimore, Maryland. Oh, my god. And right around then I think I had just watched the Wire. So have you… have any of you watched the wire which takes place in Baltimore, it was made a long time ago, but it shows the inner city of Baltimore, and it's… it's quite a place, great experience. And when the curriculum was tested then, when they went back the social policy research folks, uh… to see whether or not there was positive effects, here's what we saw, we saw that the curriculum was most effective with people of color, African-Americans, Hispanics. We found that it was more effective with married couples then unmarried couples, and we found that uh… it was later extended to foster parents and it worked also for foster parents. Now I forgot to mention that in the curriculum the couples that were involved were just pregnant or having babies, right then. So part of what we wanted to foster was fathers being included. And those fathers finding meaning with having children and having a positive experience in their intimate relationship that would keep them involved, that would keep them hanging in there. So umm… we then after we saw that this curriculum could work, we then adopted the curriculum in our own research labs in Seattle Washington to couples together against violence. So here's where we finally come in to domestic violence. So we took the curriculum and we adopted it so that there was more heavy focus on conflict management, it included methods for managing emotional flooding because what we had seen in situational domestic violence and that's all we were treating was the fact that when they escalated, when they have these huge corals that just, you know, it was took them to the ceiling, that's when the violence would occur. And if any of you have… have some knowledge of our uh… research in the past that physiological flooding or going into fight or flight means that people cannot think, they cannot problem solved, they cannot listen, they feel attacked, and they develop to tunnel vision, tunnel hearing, all the experiences attack, so no wonder that erupts into domestic violence. So we really needed to find a way to control that escalation in to physiological flooding that was an important part of this curriculum too. We needed also if they did happen to get flooded or move into fighter flight they need to have some withdrawal ritual from each other, so that the violence didn't occur, so that they could take a break, say when they were coming back and then self soothe not think about what to say when they came back, not think about the argument, but do something to self sooth and then come back. When they were calmer, when they begun to metabolize those stress hormones out of their body, and they could again here what was being said, what was really being said they could perceive things much more accurately and then they can problem solve, that's part of what was really important about this population. We also wanted to include mechanisms to make sure everybody stays safe, so we built kind of a safety network around doing this research in the first place. And we wanted to again uh… include couples who were having children as the subjects of this study. So what was the focus of our research in this project? Well, first we wanted to again test this instrument in terms of screening out domestic violence that was characterological, screening it out. So that we only had situational domestically violent couples in our group, then target the couples who were experiencing lower levels of violence which meant they were situationally domestically violent. We wanted to also emphasize not just conflict management, but skills in building intimacy, building friendship, creating a sense of shared meaning and purpose. Because one of the… the foundations of our work, it's not just skills people, it's also the fact that people have hearts, they have souls, oh, my god, you know, I'm married to a scientist, so I'm not supposed to talk about that, but they actually did do right in some way, what… however you wanna define that. And every single person is a philosopher, no matter what their education, no matter what their IQ, every person is move towards finding something that gives their lives meaning and purpose, right? So we need to include a way for these couples in our groups to connect with each other with their partners, about what gave their life meaning and purpose. And to share that with one another I didn't have to be compatible, the myth that you have to be compatible, is in fact a myth. You don't have to be. So think about those dating sites, do you have to be compatible? No, not really. However these people were not sharing what they felt inside at that deeper level. So we needed to foster that kind of sharing between these partners. Umm… Then we wanted to analyze whether we could reduce situational domestic violence, using this adapted curriculum called couples together against violence, we called it CTAV. And whether that in turn would lead to healthier marriages, these will now married couples lead to healthier marriages and responsible fatherhood. Holly-molly, we were trying to do a lot. So our research approach was this, we decided to do a… a longitudinal randomized clinical trial. So that's, you know, a randomized clinical trial is really the gold standard, where you recruit couples, screen them to make sure that there was just situational not characterological, then randomly assign them either to treatment or control. The control group received nothing, the treatment group received this curriculum, and then to use multiple methods of evaluating how you're doing, and to do so also in terms of longitudinal with follow up. So what do you do if you fix somebody and you test it right after the treatment? How about 18 months after the treatment? Are they still okay? Very, very important. You want your changes to be lasting, right? So that's precisely what we tested. So we looked at umm… baseline measures, then post-treatment, then uh… let's see six months… six months was the post-treatment because the treatment lasted about four or five months, something like that. So it's six months from the very beginning…

JULIE GOTTMAN Uh… okay. There we go. Thank you, sweetie. Umm… We would do six months which was at the end of treatment than 12 months, and then this 24 post randomization, means 24 months from before treatment, given that treatment was six months long. You're actually talking about 18 months after the end of treatment, right? So 18 months post-treatment that… that felt like a really good test of whether or not this would work. And here's how we did our assessments at every time point. First of all, we did questionnaires, so our usual questionnaires, there's the self-reports, then however, remember what we said self-report isn't enough, right? You've got too much kind of social desirability stuff and chain. Then we would do a 15 minute video taped conflict interaction in their home. So our research assistance were going into their homes and asking them to discuss a problem it would be videotaped no intervention, no nothing, videotape for 15 minutes, and then we brought those tapes back coded them to see how were they doing in terms of their conflict management. Was there hostility, were there the four horsemen, was their contempt, criticism, defensiveness, what did we see? We also measured physiology during that conflict interaction, where their heart rates going up, way beyond into, you know, the stratosphere, like they had been a baseline. Well, interesting to see. Then we also looked at police records. So we compared on all of these measures to what we were seeing in the police records? To see whether or not they're actually was domestic violence reported at least or not. Okay. So let's talk about the modules and how the modules were designed. So each module lasted about two hours. So, you know, part of what we wanted to do is we wanted to create an environment in which couples felt comfortable sharing with one another and it felt like the best way we could do that is to start each module with a little clip, a little videotape of couples just like in the group, talking about the particular topic of the week. So what we did is we brought in couples in poverty from Baltimore, from Georgia, a few from Seattle, from somewhere else that I can't remember. And we brought them into a TV studio, I sat on a stage with them and I talk to them and ask them, how they dealt with this particular topic, that particular topic, another? Three or four couples at a time, all talking together about that and sharing their own personal information, for each topic, for 21 core modules and then another 21 modules that were not necessarily needed. We then edited those films down to about 10 to 15 minutes and so each… each module, each week would start with one of these video tapes, then we would ask the couples with these two facilitators it would be in a group, right? With about 5, 6 couples… 6 couples at the most, meeting in a group, same couples every week to please respond, to this particular video they just saw. Did they relate to it? Did they not? Did it make sense to them? Were their personal stories that they really could identify with, how about their own personal stories? And it was extremely important part of the training for the facilitators was don't start teaching. Not yet. Wait. So their job as facilitators usually a male and female pair was to simply just facilitate connection, just facilitate connection between the couples, that was all, not teacher thing, just facilitate connection. There was creating that community and guess what? I mean, that was so fabulous. I loved it, I loved it. That was the very best part of this curriculum. Because within like 3 or 4 modules out of 21 they started picking up each other outside, they started umm… you know, helping each other with job, you know, possibilities lot of these people were pretty poor, they started having barbecues, what could be better than a barbecue, right? Especially in the Deep South, when we did the original curriculum. So, you know, they really started connecting to one another and things got deeper and deeper and deeper. It was the most beautiful thing you've ever seen it was just incredible, that's exactly what we were trying to create. So after about 30 to maybe 45 minutes or so of discussion, just amongst the couples with the two facilitators, umm… just helping them connect then we would present maybe 10 to 15 minutes of a little piece of information and uh… a new skill or a… an insight something like that about the particular topic which I'll talk about in a minute. So that would be presented, then the couples would be given an exercise to do for about the last 20 minutes to a half an hour of the module. And the exercise was designed to do a number of things, to help them move practice a new conflict management scale, or to disclose something very deep and personal with their partner, or to say what their needs were, or and so on… to describe something that gave their lives meaning. Some of those exercises were fish balls, where, you know, you have two concentric circles of people, inner circles talking, circle outside is just listening than they trade roles. So, you know, there were a number of exercises and all of this was manualized and structure. That's how the curriculum worked. So umm… these videos were uh… very cool and they would discuss topics. First of all going back to the videos within the TV studio that God edited, they would be discussing things like how do you prevent violence? How do you recover when the violence has already happened? How do you recover from an affair? How do you develop intimacy after you've already had a child? What legacy do you want to leave behind for your children? So these as I mentioned, these modules really created community, but also an environment where they felt respected, they felt listened to by each other as well as the facilitators umm… and they really then were hungry for the information, they didn't have to feel ashamed that they didn't know how to do something, they didn't know how to prevent domestic violence. Because there was this whole group of couples that identified with them, they didn't have to feel alone with what they were struggling to learn. So it stopped the shaming process, you see, which was absolutely crucial to people really hungering for this knowledge, really wanting that knowledge. So right now umm… I need to tell you that I think I have a lesion in my brain where the brain is supposed to handle technology and John is gonna switch the computer, so that we can watch a collogue of these videos. Pretty cool couples, huh? All right. So let's talk about more in terms of the curriculum. So here are the five content areas that the modules are divided into preserving intimacy which includes creating friendship. Managing conflicts, and there's a number of modules etching conflict. Creating shared meaning, managing stress and physiology, and then father's marriage and parenting. So how do you put all of those together? One of the things that we decided to do in terms of decoupling head on with physiological flooding going into fight or flight is we incorporated five minutes of biofeedback training into every single meeting. So before the exercise we used these little teeny-weeny devices called M-waves, and M-waves are very cool they now come as an app of course, but back then they looked like a little cellphone with a cord that would attach to the ear measuring heart rate synchronicity, and there would be a little bank of lights on each one that would go up and down and you were to follow that with your breathing, there was another light that change colored, how many of you remember mood rings? Yeah. There's not very many of us a lot, who really getting old you guys. But anyway, so the point is that… that… that little light at the top you can see it in this umm… you see that little green light, well, that one might start as red and then it would slowly moved to blue and then finally to green. And green indicated they are in heart rate synchronicity that your heart rate was lower that you were in good place, basically. So we would have… we had just, you know, some of these not a whole lot people wouldn't take them home, we'd pass them out each time the couples came to a group meeting, they would practice with them for five minutes, that was it. Just five minutes, before they would do their exercise, whatever that skill training or discussion, or self-disclosure would be. So that was an important piece of trying to help them learn how to physiologically self sooth, guess what? They learned, just five minutes a week that was it. So people this is uh… an example of a module preventing and recovering from pilots. So couples would first watch that video for about 15 minutes and then discuss it, self-disclosure would be facilitated for about 40 minutes, then some information would be given especially about physiological flooding, and how to bring up a problem, how to bring up a problem. Because a lot of times when people bring up problems with their partners that first three minutes of a conflict conversation predicts with 90% accuracy. What's gonna happen at the end of the conversation? What's gonna happen six years down the road in the relationship? That first three minutes. So really important to learn how to bring up a problem, not using the four horsemen. So basic skill like I, I feel something about what, here's what I need, here's what I do need not what I don't need. So we had people practice that uh… using kind of a fun card deck. Umm… But before doing that they would first get into the green zone with their little M-wave and then they would do the exercise. With intimacy modules, so remember our categories, here are the categories now. There were modules on staying close, So how do you stay close and have deeper conversations? Having close conversations, how do you express your needs? How do you do that? How many of you have clients who struggle with expressing their needs? Right? Like it's so difficult for people, of course in this country because we're all Americans, we don't have any needs, but then again we're pack animals and so we do. So really important to understand, how to express needs, how to respond to those. Turning towards verses away is how to respond to needs. Magnifying and savoring positive emotion. So how to express appreciation for one another, admiration for one another and so on, very, very important to do in a regular way every single day. So we worked on that in another module to build a culture of respect and appreciation, then building passion and good sex, how do you do that? How do you actually do that? Good question. So we talk about that too, in terms of again expressing your needs sexually, and how scary that is, and how to refuse having sex without your poor partner umm… you know, feeling stabbed in the heart. How about healing old wounds? So almost all of these people had experienced painful stuff in childhood, had they told each other about it? Not really. Not really. So we had an exercise for that one where partners paired up and talk to each other about some of the most painful stuff they've gone through in childhood. Finally preventing and recovering from infidelity. So how do you prevent it? How do you recommit to each other? So for example with healing of wounds, this was really interesting. We had a couple where he complained a lot bitterly about how she would always controlling, she had to control everything, and he didn't understand why and it drove him nuts, just drove him nuts. Big, big conflict issue. So during healing old wound she told the following story. When she was six years old, she was in her bedroom in their apartment which was on the ground floor with a nice big window. One night, her father who she had not seen since she was about three came with a diamond cutter, cut a hole in the window, crawl through the window, picked her up from the bed, took her out, put her in a car and drove away. She didn't see her mother for six months, six years old. She had no idea of where they were going, they ended up in Montana. What is it with Montana? So strange, I don't get that, but anyway the mother went on, you know, a crusade, a search, umm… state by state by state trying to find her child and eventually she did, after six months. So imagine, imagine how that child felt out of control, do you think she was gonna allow especially a male to control her after that? Not easy, right? So once he heard that story from her just the two of them sitting together and that's how we would do it, pairs of people around the edges of the room talking to one another, he got it, it didn't mean he un… he really loved now being controlled and totally changed everything, he still didn't like it, but at least he had much more compassion when she was in the space where she was doing that, does that make sense? Yeah. Okay. How about preventing and recovering from infidelity? Okay. Well, so that was a really important one too and we educated the couples in our little 15 minute, little talking there, many of them had suffered infidelity, we talked about the PTSD, that the person who's been betrayed, suffers from, in terms of infidelity. And what they would need from each other in order to prevent duality. So this was actually a longer piece there were a couple of modules involving this, and they had done a lot of preliminary work before getting here, they talked about needs, they talked about conflict management and so on. So one Couple came back after that module, it was so cool because in this culture, you know, the guys were going out, the women were staying home with the babies, right? So he had gone out with his buddies and they'd gone to a club like they usually did and when he got into that club, you know, their pattern had been they would go pick up women, they would go mess around outside the club, have a little sex outside, go back in and go home. That was the pattern. This time when he went into the club, he broke out into a cold sweat, good sign. He went out of the club, he sat down on the curb, and he thought, "Do I really wanna do this?" He thought and thought, and then he finally went back in and said, Sorry, I'm going home, he went home and he shared with us what were his thoughts during that time, he said, you know, I'm with her for life and if they can't support this relationship then I don't wanna be a part of them. She's more important to me than they are, and I'll build a wall between them and my girl and me. And the whole group just like… they were very excited, and really supported him. How about managing conflict? So under managing conflict modules, we have preventing harmful fights. So how do you do that? Well, in part that has to do with how do you bring up a fight? how do you make… how do you bring up a conflict area? How do you make repairs if things are starting to go badly? How do you reach compromise? Well, we have some very specific tools for that, obviously managing conflict has been a big thing and a lot of John's research early on and then in our methods uh… which we've tested since then. We also talked about self soothing including the biofeedback, managing anger, how do you manage your own anger as well as others? Having recovery conversations after a fight. So, yes, everybody fights sooner or later everybody hurts the other. So how do you recover from that? You know, there's some really wonderful research by this little teeny-weeny Jewish woman in the 1920s name (inaudible), who studied memory. And from her research we learned that people will never get past regrettable incidence if they don't fully process them. And if you apologize right when it happens too fast without really processing what happened and what people were feeling it doesn't work, it fails. So we taught people how to recover after they'd had a regrettable incident. Then we talked about avoiding and healing violence recognizing when you were heating up how to take a break. And it's everybody's responsibility in these couples with situational domestic violence. So we taught more methods in that second part. Also knowing when endless fights can turn harmful. That's talking about perpetual problems. So many of you if you're familiar with our work you know that 69% of all problems couples experience are perpetual problems, they never go away, right? They never go away. So they're not really solvable, they are based in differences in personality or lifestyle preferences. So when you're choosing a partner, you're choosing the set of problems you're going to have for the rest of your life. Isn't that a great way to think about it? So, you know, we talk about… Okay, well, so if you've got this perpetual problem how do you talk about it in such a way that you don't escalate, that you don't hit the ceiling, or you don't shut down and avoid it? How can you talk about it in a way that builds understanding and compassion, and maybe a little bit of humor because it keeps coming up over and over and over. So that's an important module, and then how to accept influence? Remember with domestic violence what accepting influence means is if your partners presenting their point of view, you can say, "Ha, good point." It's all it takes. Or saying, "Yep, fair enough." Okay. That's accepting influence as opposed to what we were seeing especially in characterological domestic violence. So umm… what? 

01:08:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Hurry up. 

01:08:50
JULIE GOTTMAN I've got to hurry up. Okay. Uh… So we talked about reaching your boiling point umm… and with one couple who'd had a lot of domestic violence, they came back one week, they were moving towards violence in an awful episode. He ran to the bathroom locked himself in to the bathroom until he could calm down. Again he came back the next week and everybody cheered. So that's the kind of stuff that we're helping folks to do. Shared meaning is honoring each other's dreams, connecting emotionally, creating rituals of connection, dealing with stress, a big deal for couples in poverty. How to have a stress reducing conversation? Also postpartum depression was a part of that. Umm… And fathers marriage parenting, most had never had fathers, most of these people had never had fathers. So we had one guy who was 24 years old, he just gotten out of prison, seven years worth was having a baby with his partner, this was indeed Florida. And he said, you know, for the first time I have a purpose for living. I've got a son. For the first time he felt that. So super important, also we've done Johnston research on parenting. We include that in this curriculum in terms of helping couples learn how to emotion coach with their kids, creating emotionally intelligent kids. Okay. Sweetie? 

01:10:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. 

01:10:35
JULIE GOTTMAN I think you should take over, okay. 

01:10:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Thank you, Julie. 

01:10:40
JULIE GOTTMAN You're welcome. 

01:10:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Isn't she Wonderful? 

01:10:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Thanks. 

01:10:50
JOHN GOTTMAN So as part of the research study, umm… we have these teams of researchers going to couples homes and setting up the cameras and having them talk about an area of conflict and getting physiological measure synchrony is to the video time code. And these videotapes in the control group and the experimental group are scored blind by observers. They don't know if they're in the control group or the experimental group or what time point they took these uh… videotapes. And we also we're screening out antisocial personality disorder here. So umm… here are the results. First of all we… in the treatment group the relationship satisfaction significantly increased and there was much less conflict than the control groups. And this effect listed on 18 month follow up, also significant increases in self-reports on both friendship and intimacy scales as well as shared meaning, and through these a greater parental alliance. So they were changing and the way they were parenting as well, not only in their relationship. Also we found that males particularly were becoming much more successful in their ability to physiologically self sooth during the conflict discussion. So they're staying low and physiological arousal, whereas in the control group over time there was more and more physiological arousal of the males. And domestic violence also was… was reduced, it was mediated though through acquiring the relationship skills. And part of the problem was the amount of attendance at these umm… at these modules. So the more people attended, the more they were committed, the more we were reducing intimate partner violence, and there's a significant difference between the control group an experimental group on police records of domestic violence. Umm… When we looked at hostile behavior during the videotapes looking at contempt and belligerence, domineering, anger, defensiveness, this is what the data looked like. The green line is the experimental group and you can see over the four time points it goes down and stays down, whereas it's really the trend is going up and the blue line, and this is for men uh… and the same kind of pattern for… for women, the green line is what's happening over time for the women in the experimental group. So we're really changing interactive behavior during conflict and we're changing physiological arousal during conflict, so it stays low and the experiment group. You know, there are limitations in this uh… not all the couples acquired the skills and the major problem was if people didn't attend more than 50% of this session. There's a lot of chaos in the lives of these lower-income couples that makes it hard for them to attend 22 sessions. Umm… And… and this was… this was not court-mandated treatment, so uh… we have to really in the next study increase the amount of cohesion that we have in the group to hold the couples. Uh… Now here's the question you know this is a brief therapy conference, right? Uh… Can we make this intervention shorter 22 sessions each session listing two ours, you know, that's 44 hours of therapy. So umm… when we look at the best predictors of divorce, which are the four horsemen of the apocalypse we call them. Criticism, defensiveness, contempt is stonewalling, much higher and couples that have situational domestic violence. So these need to be reduced and in this study what we did uh… was in our two-day workshop the first day we deals with friendship and intimacy and the second day deals with conflict destructive conference conflict. So in this study we… we had one group that only worked on friendship and intimacy. One group that only worked on conflict, one group that worked on both and a control group, and this is what the data looked like in terms of the four horsemen. So pre-post and follow up on the bottom the horizontal axis, and the green line is the combined treatment. So it's only in the green line when we work on both friendship and conflict very much like the dismantling study that Neil Jacobsen did that we get a decrease in the four horsemen and it stays down. So the answer is can we reduce this treatment? And the answer we have to say is we don't think so. So we need to focus on both conflict than intimacy in any study we do going forward. All right? Our plans uh… I don't know what that thing is on the top. Is the whenever… we now have we're actually now conducting that just planning a replication study and this is court-mandated treatment and so we're taking a look at in… in Oregon, they require the… the male treat… male only treatment and in this study and we're adding the couples treatment after the male on the treatment. And we're trying to increase group cohesion in this study. Umm… So this is kind of if you want to know more about this, the Gottman Institute uh… the website is Gottman.com and articles are posted on this other website on this research study has been published in peer reviewed journals already. And you can obtain the… the journal articles on John Gottman.net if you're interested in reading more about this. Thank you very much for listening. 

01:16:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:17:00
[sil.] 

01:17:05
JOHN GOTTMAN And we have time for questions and that's… that's why I was hurrying Julie. So that, you know, we can have time for questions we have 25 minutes and if you would be so kind as to come up to the microphone. 

01:17:15
[sil.] 

01:17:20
JULIE GOTTMAN So questions? 

01:17:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Your mic on? 

01:17:25
[sil.] 

01:17:30
JULIE GOTTMAN If you wouldn't… is my mic up? Uh… If you wouldn't mind coming up to the mic… Yes, sir. 

01:17:35
UNKNOWN Well, I was gonna wait, but nobody came so I jumped. Umm… It's… it's been very interesting in… in my life because my daughter's a journalist in Australia. And she's been dealing with this for a couple of years and she's just won every award uh… in… in the which is great everyone's focusing on this. And where he's really focusing on is shame, which you've mentioned a couple of times and she did ask me to stand up and ask you uh… what she's looking at is the shame in the men uh… and I'm… she is wondering if you had some comments and I'm… 

01:18:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. I really… you know, I'm glad you asked that because umm… Patty Waterford who is one of our therapists is running this the second study replicating with a much more difficult sample a court mandated sample. Umm… You know, she had never run one of these groups are foreign and the first group is started and she said, she… she sent an email and which she said, I can't believe how different it is because the men don't feel any shame, their partners are there and they're working together on this problem. It's not anybody pointing a finger and saying, "This is your fault and you're bad." It's a coupled dealing with the problem together and… and she said she was just amazed at how different the groups were than the all male groups that she runs. You want to say… 

01:19:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Let me… Yeah, let me also… is my mic on? Okay. 

01:19:05
JOHN GOTTMAN How about moving the… in it… 

01:19:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Is it now? 

01:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, you're going. 

01:19:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah, okay, good. Umm… So part… part of the big difference with situational domestic violence versus characterological is that in characterological DV, the men do not feel shame, they don't feel guilty don't feel shame adult, adult. But in situational domestic violence they do in the sense that they take responsibility for themselves, they take responsibility for uh… how they're hurting the relationship their own contributions to it, and they really, really want to create change. The other thing too is that many of these couples have come from very damaging backgrounds, very painful backgrounds where the shame is profoundly at the center of… of what their experience has been. And if they're in poverty especially in this country where there's huge differences in class their shame around out as well. Not to mention the fact that uh… white people, shame people of color constantly. And so they've experienced that especially in the school system but elsewhere as well. So there's lots of shame in both genders. 

01:20:35
UNKNOWN Well, she's writing a book, she's been commissioned to do this and uh… journalistic book, it will be out next year. 

01:20:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah! 

01:20:40
UNKNOWN And she… she be very interested in and thank you very much for… 

01:20:40
JOHN GOTTMAN How you're proud of her. 

01:20:45
UNKNOWN Big dad. 

01:20:45
JULIE GOTTMAN That's great, thank you. 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN Do you have any ideas about potential effective treatment for the pitbulls? 

01:20:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Umm… Right now we don't know how to treat umm… the Pitbulls and the cobras. And umm… but Julia Babcock has been working on… on two interventions that Julie and I developed one on softened start-up. You know, this idea of really presenting your… presenting your issue in a gentle way, and also editing out negativity. So you edit out you down-regulate negative effect in the way problems are presented, just those two interventions. And in what we call a proximal change experiment in other words can you teach these pitbulls and cobras to just change the second of two conflict discussions, can you interrupt marital conflict? Teach these skills in, you know, about a half an hour and then continue the conflict discussion. Have you changed them at all? And the answer is we can change them, compared to a control group. So this proximal change, but we haven't been able to get funding to do the research and see whether this kind of approach would actually decreased domestic violence and characterological domestic violence. So believe it or not there… there is no funding for treating domestic violence in the National Institute of Mental Health. None. 

01:22:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. 

01:22:25
UNKNOWN I understand there's been a change in the treatment for men uh… in domestic violence cases where in the past there's been this umm… anger management approach where there's more of an expressive kinda get the anger out, I understand there has been a shift to aggression replacement which is more of a CBT approach of you heard of any research on that or ethics studies or if you think it would be effective? Certainly your model would be great… 

01:22:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, I mean, that's… 

01:22:50
UNKNOWN …not gonna go. 

01:22:50
JOHN GOTTMAN That would be a very promising way to go umm… 

01:22:55
JULIE GOTTMAN But it is just men only, right? 

01:23:00
UNKNOWN Right, just men only, right. 

01:23:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. So, you know, as far as we know anger management uh… is… is very effective umm… and uh… and anything that down-regulates negative effect during conflict is gonna do something, but my guess would be that again you have to look at those two other components to get lasting change which is not only change the nature of conflict, but change the nature of emotional connection and intimacy and manage physiological arousal. So… 

01:23:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Let me also mention, however, I mean, keep in mind that what Donald Dutton found in the situationally domestic violence couples is that 71% of the time women through the first blow. 

01:23:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, you're right. 

01:23:45
JULIE GOTTMAN So if you're not helping the women also to down regulate their physiology. Their four horsemen and so on you're only trading half of the problem, it's not enough. 

01:24:00
UNKNOWN That's true, that's true. But I understand the… the cognitive approach is really helping the… the violent person the male usually to identify controlling cognitions like she shouldn't do this, she must not do that, she better not do that, and he can change that then he has less of uh… of an aggressive uh… adrenaline kind of response, of courses the thought distortion too, but I just thought maybe you heard zone but… 

01:24:20
JOHN GOTTMAN No, I'm not familiar with that. 

01:24:25
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

01:24:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, thank you. 

01:24:25
UNKNOWN Thanks for coming. 

01:24:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, thank you. 

01:24:30
UNKNOWN Hi, umm… I… I… I noticed… 

01:24:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Can you talk right into the mic for us? 

01:24:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, move close to it. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Umm… I… I notice that your study umm… you excluded people with substance use disorder and I'm wonder… umm… I'm seeing a lot of people with comorbidity substance abuse disorder within the context of domestic violence. What do you envision, a treatment would be in conjunction with what you already have? 

01:24:55
JULIE GOTTMAN You have to treat the addiction. You've gotta treat the addiction first. You know, let's not forget that when people uh… have a substance abuse problem, it's very difficult for people to integrate in new learning, it's very difficult for people to moderate their aggression, uh… and so on. And so we are actually doing uh… work in that field as well in terms of helping couples with addiction problems. We've developed a workshop uh… for that… that was developed by one of our certified therapists. Umm… A fellow named Robert Navarra, Dr. Robert Navarra, who's wonderful in California. He's created that workshop, he's teaching uh… how to give that workshop. So I think you would really need to focus on the addiction first. 

01:25:50
JOHN GOTTMAN But you're right the… the comorbidity of especially alcohol addiction and domestic violence is very high and Lender's research shows that that is a real problem. So, you know, subsequent research needs to look at both problems together and see whether this approach would work. 

01:26:10
UNKNOWN I see. Just to follow up I'm just wondering designing your research how did you decide to umm… exclude antisocial and substance abuse comorbidities in your population? 

01:26:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, you know, we're… we excluded the antisocial personality disorder to really make sure we were getting rid of the characterological domestic violence perpetrator, umm… but the… you know, basically what, you know, you want to do in a… in a problem that has been intractable as much as domestic violence has been is to only take one problem at a time and see if you can make some headway. And then, you know, and then now go to a more difficult which is we're going to a much more difficult case and in this new randomized clinical trial in Oregon, where it's a court referred sample court-mandated sample and there we… we don't exclude people who uh… have problems with substance abuse and addiction. And so the second study we will deal with the more difficult kind of, you know, uh… problem and we'll see if the same methods can work with that problem. 

01:27:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:27:20
JOHN GOTTMAN One at a time, you know. 

01:27:20
UNKNOWN Thank you, so much. 

01:27:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Sure. 

01:27:25
UNKNOWN Hi. 

01:27:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Hi. 

01:27:25
UNKNOWN First, thank you for sharing all these information, I think that it's very, very interesting and important for me. 

01:27:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:27:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:27:35
UNKNOWN And I going to assure you that I am from Mexico, in Mexico we have these problem you show the UNESCO files and we have… I think that more than 30% of domestic violence and I think I… I was thinking now that the two types of domestic violence I have that… have these wire that it's people who learn to act like that, it's people who learned because of their father, of their mother or their grandfather, and they are just uh… doing things because they think that, that is gonna… to (inaudible)… 

01:28:30
UNKNOWN To work. 

01:28:30
UNKNOWN To… to work. Thank you. That's… that's… that umm… it's the… it's the way, they think that they are going to be uh… a good man or a good woman and sometimes they don't see that this is going to be a bad thing, they think that, that's okay because that's the way it works. So umm… I was thinking about that maybe we can figure out how to work these kind of curriculum with the other uh… type no then the first one to kinda charactrological one… 

01:29:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Charactrological one, yeah. 

01:29:20
UNKNOWN And we can find out how to do it and here we are uh… a lot Mexican therapies that are very happy to work with you in order to find out uh… a way and a very brief way to do it. Because in Mexico we have these everyday and every time. 

01:29:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Let me mention something the original uh… curriculum that this is based on loving couples, loving children. We did in uh… Spanish, with Spanish videos. So there was a parallel program uh… that was given to people who are from Mexico, Central America, South America, now living in the United States but more comfortable with Spanish and uh… the all of the videos were redone in Spanish with uh… two other uh… facilitators umm… both of Hispanic origins umm… and so the all the preliminary work has been done uh… that could be used in Mexico. I think that the only thing that I would be uh… concerned about in terms of treating characterological domestic violence is that it's not just about learning, we don't think it's just about learning, we don't know what… what causes that kind of violence, right? But with situational domestic violence, you know, we would hope that this would be effective and we did see the original curriculum effective also with couples who were Spanish-speaking. 

01:31:10
JOHN GOTTMAN But when you think about it, don't just think about conflict escalating as being the problem it's also about intimacy. Okay? Alright it's also about emotional connection and friendship and physiological arousal. So think about those three parts of the intervention have to all be there, okay? Yeah. 

01:31:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Great, thank you. 

01:31:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:31:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you for your work. 

01:31:35
UNKNOWN Hi. Thank you, first for this wonderful, wonderful lecture. Thank you. 

01:31:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Thank you. 

01:31:40
UNKNOWN If you like to learn a lot, I work at the college counseling center and I meet a lot of young couples who to me seem very enmeshed with each other with frequent situation of violence between them and hope clickable is this type of research and this type of treatment to people who will get to develop their capacity, full intimacy in the grownup way? 

01:32:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Wait, I… I didn't hear the last part of the question. 

01:32:10
JOHN GOTTMAN How effective… how effective would be with the college age population? 

01:32:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Who are in committed relationships? 

01:32:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:32:20
JULIE GOTTMAN I think it could be very, it could be very successful I think umm… a lot the people that this was done with originally were first of all young. Umm… I think the only thing that would need to change a little bit. Depending on what country you're doing this in is of course you would need umm… couples who uh… in the videotapes more we're more similar to the couples in your population. So that means college kids or young 20s and millennials who uh… had probably much better academic experience, we're able to absorb the information using maybe more sophisticated language nonetheless I wouldn't change uh… the format of it. I would keep the video tape I would keep the community feeling. 

01:33:25
JOHN GOTTMAN What country is he? 

01:33:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh… what country? 

01:33:25
UNKNOWN While the accent is Israeli, but I actually work in (inaudible) island and many of the college kids are from The Bronx, and first generation collage students from not that best of the Southern. 

01:33:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:33:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. Right. Okay. So, you know, what else more to do with umm… you probably could use you know the… the basic format you just have to redo uh… the videos to some degree. To have the experiences matching uh… what's, you know, what's being talked about in the videos matching what the population that you're serving has experienced. Otherwise the videos don't serve as a motivator for them to self-disclose, they see them as other they see them as different, that's not me and it wouldn't necessarily encourage discussion. 

01:34:25
JOHN GOTTMAN That make sense? 

01:34:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. 

01:34:30
JULIE GOTTMAN You're welcome. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN Thanks… thanks for all those years of research and the… the clear explanation. There was something that was intrigued about when you were saying that you would first solve the addiction because coming from Europe, umm… the European solution focused school umm… the brooch model starts from when… when we work with addictions from the question what… what is your existential perspective, what kind of person do you want to be? And almost always decline comes with an answer like, I want to become a good father or mother, or good spouse or, you know, this kind of basic existential needs. And what we see when we do alcohol treatment gear was that from that model it's the driving force for stopping the alcohol behavior is the desire to have a good relationship. And it's like you're now saying, first fix the addiction with this a little bit in opposition to the model that I'm used to work with. 

01:35:35
JULIE GOTTMAN It's actually not, umm… let me explain a little bit further because I wasn't very clearly for so forgive me. What… what uh… we have been talking about in terms of addiction and treating the addiction first is we treat the addiction within the relationship. 

01:35:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:35:55
JULIE GOTTMAN So it's a couples approach to treating addiction. So uh… that's what Robert Navarro has developed. So he's really looking at you know, the… the practicing alcoholic, is recovery is in recovery the partner is in recovery and the relationship is in recovery because of course the relationship has been strongly affected by the addiction as well. 

01:36:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:36:25
JULIE GOTTMAN And so in the model that he has created that's based on our work and our methods and so on. You were treating the relationship and how the addiction has created each individual and the relationship. So working within a couple of contexts to treat the addiction that's what I meant. 

01:36:45
UNKNOWN So… so I would assume that in that way of working umm… in many cases the oldest skills soulful domestically while working on the addiction? 

01:36:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Oh, no, no. 

01:37:00
UNKNOWN Okay. No. 

01:37:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Not necessarily. I mean, sometimes they do. 

01:37:00
JOHN GOTTMAN You have to build everything. 

01:37:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes you do. All right. 

01:37:05
UNKNOWN Thanks a lot. 

01:37:05
JOHN GOTTMAN You know, like a house. 

01:37:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, thanks a lot. 

01:37:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Each floor. Sir? 

01:37:10
UNKNOWN I… I hope this is on topic, umm… because… 

01:37:15
JULIE GOTTMAN It doesn't matter if it doesn't… but don't ask about the election. 

01:37:20
UNKNOWN So you had infidelity up there and I'm wondering what both of your feelings are about when couples are dealing with infidelity in terms of how much depth one partner wants to know and ask a lot of questions whether that's useful or where do you draw the line… 

01:37:35
JULIE GOTTMAN So we've just created a workshop umm… to teach clinicians how to treat infidelity. Umm… As well, so it's actually a three-day workshop that includes. Day one, treating couples where there's PTSD and then days two and three all day, how do you help couples uh… with infidelity and move couples towards, you know, to recover. How do you do therapy with couples who've had infidelity to create recovery? So we've got a whole training program on that at this point. 

01:38:15
JOHN GOTTMAN And a study. 

01:38:15
JULIE GOTTMAN And a study uh… that we're conducting right now, here and now. Umm… So into… base just, you know, a little teeny-weeny nutshell. So we have a three-stage treatment approach. The first stages atonement, second stages attunement, third stage is attachment. In atonement that first stage which you may revisit from time to time. It's very important that the betrayed partner can ask questions and need to ask questions, very, very important. And have those questions answered with absolute transparency. Also during atonement, the partner who's done the betraying needs to hear the person uh… who has been betrayed with their emotions needs to hear their anger, their pain, their anguish, their terror, their etcetera. Also what needs to be explained is that the person almost invariably who has been betrayed is suffering from PTSD, serious PTSD. And that needs to be understood, and their reactions which at times are explosive other times are numb, etcetera are part and parcel of having that PTSD. And as the questions are answered, as they move through treatment through attunement which deals after that betrayer really accepts responsibility, listens to feelings, answers questions, and says, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, many, many, many times. Moving into a two-month finally you can look at the patterns in the relationship and how to create marriage number two because marriage number one is gone, it's kaput. So you have to create marriage number two with very different tools, very different ways of resolving conflicts and creating friendship. Anyway that's. 

01:40:30
JOHN GOTTMAN We have time for one more question. 

01:40:30
JULIE GOTTMAN One more question, oh, we do. I hope that helped. 

01:40:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:40:35
JULIE GOTTMAN And that workshop incidentally, uh… next time it's being given is San Francisco June. Will go to the Gottman website you'll see it advertised there. There will also be on day four, how to treat couples with addiction presented by Robert Navarro in June. 

01:40:55
UNKNOWN I'll cut line short just to say for six years I was director of counseling in an outpatient part of a family shelter and this concept would have really helped. About 95% of the women that we saw and it was very difficult to do as a systemic therapists. So the need for this is so great and I'm just thinking how is this gonna spread to the right… 

01:41:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Through you. Through you. Through you. Through you. Go out and talk. 

01:41:30
UNKNOWN Pardon? 

01:41:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Go out and talk. 

01:41:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Thank you very much. Thank you. 

01:41:35
