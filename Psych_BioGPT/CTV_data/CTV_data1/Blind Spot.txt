Blind Spot 

00:01:10
VANESSA In most ways, things are fairly well set in my life, but I, I have one little black cloud that's been hanging over my head, and that has been the fact that I don't have a driver's license. It all seems to stem to the fact that my sister developed a mental illness, schizophrenia, um, right around the time that I was 16. When you're a kid, you know, you, you feel the anxiety of your parents, and, um, that built and built, and when she actually really did have full-blown mental illness, and was in and out of hospitals, it's, it's just so frightening to not know what's going on, and that kid's little life, that little life that I had been used to, the foundation was just taken from under me. Everything that I had relied on and understood no longer could be relied upon, no longer made sense. And my parents weren't necessarily there all the time when I needed them. It was all about my sister, and all of us were terrified, and it, it was a very, very frightening, painful experience. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN As long as Vanessa lives, she would always think that I put her sister ahead. Uh, when she wanted to learn to drive, I ignored her. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Someone else would have been, uh, aching to drive because of the same situation, and probably would be out there driving a racecar today. 

00:03:10
VANESSA My earliest recollection of any kind of learning to drive was, uh, when I was 12, and my sister would have been around 15, and we were up at our farm, and we were on this secluded road that we called the frog road. My dad thought this was a good place to take my sister, who's approaching her 16th birthday, to learn to drive. I was brought along and I was sitting in the back seat. So, you know, after she had tried and failed, or whatever kind of went on, I was saying, 'ok,' you know, 'when, when's my turn? I want to try to drive.' 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN I remember that she was quite upset when we told her that she would be second in line, uh, as far as driving was concerned. 

00:04:05
VANESSA My dad basically said my sister is older, three years older. The way the world works is that first she learns to drive, and when she gets her driver's license, then it would be my turn to learn to drive and to get my license. Well, what we didn't realized at the time was that my sister would never get her driver's license. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Boy, it's a strain to teach, uh, these girls to drive. I don't want to do it, then you in the back seat, uh, you, you got a couple years to wait, anyways. Leave me alone. 

00:04:45
VANESSA I've often thought that when I was in the backseat of the car, that time on the frog road, that that's when the family dynamic was laid out; that my sister would be driving the family even though she wasn't actually operating the vehicle, and that I would be in the back seat permanently. 

00:05:05
[music] 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Well, she's tell, telling us that we failed her in the past, and we gave, uh, all kind of, of priorities to her sick sister, and we neglected her. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN We were in the situation where we had two young women, vulnerable and sensitive, and one of them cracked up, and the other one had to lose, uh, a lot of attention, and Vanessa appears to want to continue to be resentful because she wasn't given the attention that she thought was required at that time so she could learn to drive. It sounds pretty silly, but it's also very profound because it's about human needs, it's about passages, it's about peers, it's about all the things that, that we, we want and need, and, um, in a way, have a right to. We have a right to nurturing and, and love, but not necessarily on our terms. 

00:06:30
VANESSA My sister was getting sick at the same time she was learning to drive, and I think, as I was kind of witnessing her trying to drive, I was witnessing these strange things also occurring. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Well, there were times when Vanessa's sister said there were these knives stuff in her back, stuck in her back. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN 'Please come right away and help me take these knives out of my chest. I have, I have knives in my chest and they're going to kill me.' 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN And she needed help to have them pulled out. And we did everything we could to sort of pull out the knives. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN 'There was an angel standing by my bed. He is saying you're a very wicked person and you should die.' 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN There were times when Vanessa's sister left the house in the middle of the night, and in winter, wearing a bathrobe, or, or a nightgown, no bathrobe, and maybe some slippers, and there was snow on the ground. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN And we called the police, and everybody goes out and we'd look in every alley, and we'd look in every snow bank, and you're sure that you're going to find, uh, the person you love lying there dead. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN At one point, I saw her, and I had to pull the car up and stop, and get out of the car. By that time, she saw me and ran away, and I couldn't find her again. 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) so many situations like, uh, attempted rape because people with, uh, schizophrenia are often very (inaudible ). 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Hours later, we went into one of the local hospitals, and we found that she was in there. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN That's what you deal with when things are at their worst, and sometimes, you don't find the person until they are dead. 

00:08:40
[music] 

00:08:45
VANESSA When my sister got sick, there was a shift in focus in our family. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN I was very, very worried about losing your sister. I, I had a feeling she was lost. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN You can just barely handle your own pain. It's a time for individual struggle. You're so busy trying to keep yourself together that there's nothing to give. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN I kept on hoping it was a dream, and I was going to wake up and this horrible situation would, would, was something I imagined. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Well, the key. 

00:09:30
VANESSA On. In park, foot's on break, check your rear-view mirror, into drive, brake goes down, check the side mirror, and then slowly... 

00:09:45
[music] 

00:09:55
VANESSA Because I was so young at the time, 14, 15 years of age, I'm just trying to find my own place in life, and my place up to that time had been part of a very loving family where I had a defined role, and my sister had a defined role. This unexpected, inexplicable behavior change in my sister started to cause a lot of anxiety. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN The family, um, uh, sort of dealt mostly with, uh, Vanessa's sister, and I think there were times, certainly, there were times when, uh, my wife and I became, uh, very, uh, anxious with each other, and, and, um, so that, uh, I went and lived elsewhere for, for quite a while. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN I just felt very sad, and mostly frightened. 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN That caused more harm to both daughters. 

00:11:00
VANESSA I was traumatized and very upset about it, and of course, hoping that everything would work out with the parents. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Vanessa missed the attention at the time when her sister got sick because I can only be spread so thin. I, I missed the attention that I wanted, then, too. I couldn't, I couldn't work, I couldn't travel, I couldn't do anything but, but concentrate on trying to make life livable for someone who often threatened suicide. What do you do if someone is saying, 'let's go, and, I, I want an ice cream cone, and you forgot to take me,' and another, uh, child who's saying, 'well, I think this is the day that I hop over the (inaudible ) bridge'? I didn't have any instruction or sixth sense or anything about what to do. I just got sadder and sadder and more frightened. 

00:12:15
[music] 

00:12:20
VANESSA I don't mind driving on something like this, obviously, that's very easy and safe... 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:12:25
VANESSA There's not a lot of other traffic. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, but that isn't what driving is like. 

00:12:25
VANESSA No, but it's a good way of starting. We all kept in secret; I didn't tell any of my friends, and we didn't know exactly how to deal with it. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN In those days, when somebody was, uh, ill, uh, mentally, it was always thought of as the cause of the family, and mostly, the mother. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN I didn't get in-, invited to dinner parties anymore. (inaudible ) dinner parties, but, there, there was a stigma that, that came, and a great black bird that came and landed on my roof, and that was: 'mental illness is in this house.' 

00:13:15
VANESSA There's a stigma now, there's a stigma then; uh, if, if people knew that, that she had some kind of psychiatric problem, then, are they going to assume that I have it, that the whole family has it, that, um, we're not going to be able to go ahead in life and we could never get married, could never have kids, we could never succeed in University? There's so many things that people will read into mental illness because most people don't know that much about it. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN People who have mental illness who are behaving badly, dragging, uh, baby carriages around, talking with themselves, not looking clean, they're instantly rejected, and I was concerned that my daughter was going to be like that and be a bag, bag lady, cuz they were, well, always, suffering from schizophrenia. 

00:14:15
VANESSA I learned at a, at an early age to keep secrets; to keep secrets about my sister's illness, to keep secrets about the extent of my sister's illness. I have, over time, adopted that as a way of handling difficult issues in my life. I think it's a very bad way to handle things. Bottling things in tends to make for a lot of anxiety, and, uh, for not a very happy person. My sister's illness (inaudible ) approach of keeping it a secret ended up being a sort of foundation for how I have handled things for the rest of my life. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Vanessa is, tends to be, a lot, uh, more restrained than she was when she was 15, but most of us are. Uh, life sobers us down. 

00:15:10
[music] 

00:15:15
VANESSA Coming up to that walk, again, which I'm going to... 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:20
VANESSA (inaudible ). I don't know the best way, sorry. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN Well, there isn't a best way through that gully. 

00:15:25
VANESSA (inaudible ). 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN No, you did it right; you didn't slam on the brake. You slowed down, and that was the best way. 

00:15:35
VANESSA I wasn't convinced that it was truly an illness. It was, uh, even if it was an illness, I thought that it was something that she had more control of. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN My daughter was, uh, full of ideas about how to, uh, self-destruct. The illness tells people to do some very bizarre things, including jumping off bridges, including, um, going in from of subway trains. My daughter would, maybe, uh, punch her hand against, uh, uh, a door, or take a knife and chop the edge of a counter, and hold the knife over her wrist and threaten, uh, to, um, hurt herself. 

00:16:35
VANESSA You never know if a suicide threat is an empty or full threat, so you have to treat it as if it's legitimate, but, uh, there's also that well-known tale of the boy who cried wolf, where there's been so many of these threats that seem to be so thrown out if, if she doesn't get what she wants. You know, 'dad come and, come and drive me; I'm at the corner of whatever and whatever, and, you know, I don't want to have to go as far on foot. Come and drive me.' If my dad says no, then, 'okay, I'm going to kill myself.' 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN I believe she does not want to hurt herself. I want to try, at least, to be positive and to help Vanessa's sister when she needs that kind of help. 

00:17:20
VANESSA Those kinds of things seem to be very much set up as manipulations of certain situations. (inaudible ), he's in the car, he goes and picks her up. This poor geezer is, is rushing out to pick up his daughter at, uh, at all hours. I don't buy that she couldn't have gotten a cab or found somebody else. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN There have been times when we have been used, we, there have been times when I've been used by Vanessa. So, I don't count those, and I'm not out looking for them, I'm just, as a father, always trying my best for both my daughters. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN Those were much stronger cries for help and attention than what Vanessa was giving me. 

00:18:10
[music] 

00:18:15
UNKNOWN I can see a stop (inaudible ). 

00:18:20
VANESSA I want to go out a little farther so I can actually see. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN You can ease out, and come to a stop. You can ease out. 

00:18:25
VANESSA It's clear on the road. I can't (inaudible ). 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN Ease out a bit more, so ease out a bit more, so you can, ease out, very slowly, keep going. 

00:18:30
VANESSA (inaudible )I can see. So, I'm going to go now, carefully. I remember the first time my sister was hospitalized. I was skeptical. I thought that she had orchestrated something to get attention, yet again, from my parents. And we all had gone in the middle of the night, and she had been checked into this facility, and maybe a day later, I had come after school to see how she was doing, and I was basically ready to say, 'it's time to go. Quit, quit this faking,' you know, 'what is this crap?' And I knelt down beside her bed, and I looked into her eyes, and I realized that she wasn't faking it. This, this was not the sister that I had grown up with. This was not the friend who I loved, who I had spent so much time with, you know, sharing secrets and just living, living a life. This was now a, a stranger looking back with a complete blank stare, just emptiness. And I, I had this sort of sick feeling from the top of my head, like a heat that just whooshed through my whole body, and I realized that, uh, she's, she, she's gone. 

00:20:00
[music] 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Vanessa had to tag along, uh, through this journey through hell. 

00:20:15
VANESSA The family traipsing from psychiatric ward to psychiatric ward, from shrink's office to shrink's office, social worker's office to social worker's office, and it was all about the illness. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Just because she was only 16, it didn't mean that she couldn't, uh, uh, read the signs and, and, uh, learn what was obvious. 

00:20:45
VANESSA This illness was just so absorbing for our family that that's where I found myself going. And I, I love my sister, and I loved her then, and I couldn't just not go. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN I expected her to be there, yes. I wasn't going to pretend that, uh, it wasn't happening, we were sending her off to boarding school or sending her on a grand tour to Europe, so that she wouldn't be part of this pain. 

00:21:20
VANESSA I had been used as a pillar of support that I had to be this rock and I couldn't have a problem, I couldn't show if there was something wrong because they needed strength in, in me. I did have resentment, more so, I think, to my sister, not towards my parents or the burden of being (inaudible ), but I had a resentment to my sister for what I felt was destroying our family, and destroying my life, or maybe not destroying it, but robbing me of a couple of years. 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN We all lost. People do when someone gets sick. It's up to families to support the sick person. 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN Vanessa could have lost, uh, um, two years, three years, five years, or whatever, or whatever. Uh, she might think it's become, cuz, cuz of her sister, and possibly, for her, it was. I will all say, once again, somebody else in the same situation would have gained six years, not lost anything. 

00:22:25
VANESSA I felt like I was kind of left to my own, my own resources. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN We certainly weren't aware of your needs. We thought, 'oh, uh, you could do it.' 

00:22:40
VANESSA Didn't you sort of notice that I was withdrawing and, and, uh, didn't, didn't, didn't you think that maybe I could use some counseling advice? 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN I felt it the other way. I was getting support from you. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN I didn't know you were withdrawing. I thought you were carrying along, on bravely, uh, and terrific, uh, um, a little, a little girl, a young lady. I think I was drawing support from you. I guess I blew the not seeing a lot of things that were there. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Vanessa (inaudible ) changed. Maybe by life, not by me. 

00:23:25
[music] 

00:23:30
VANESSA I did start to understand that it, it wasn't her, that it was psychiatric and was, that it was schizophrenia that had caused all these things that had affected our family, and it wasn't anybody's fault, but that didn't really make it any easier, and it didn't give me back the lost years, but, uh, helped no longer blaming my sister. 

00:24:00
[music] 

00:24:05
VANESSA If anyone's really lost from it, it's her. You know, she's really the one that's lost more than anyone else. 

00:24:15
[music] 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN You've kept my beautiful daughter afloat, and she's much better, and it's partly because of Vanessa. Vanessa has lots of life for her sister and lots of concern. In spite of that initial anger and those feelings of rejection, she stuck with her sister and learned the hard way how to deal with mental illness. 

00:25:00
VANESSA I was always unsure about whether or not I wanted to have kids, and a big part of that uncertainty had to do with the fact that my sister had schizophrenia, and I had fears that I would have a child with the same thing, and that this would be perpetually plaguing the rest of my life. And I didn't feel that I could handle having that kid go through the misery that my sister has gone through. What do you think about the grandchild coming? 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN I think it's fabulous. I'm overjoyed and I'm looking forward to the day that I can jiggle this grandchild on my knee and, and singing idiotic songs to him or her. 

00:26:00
VANESSA I guess I feel now that whatever happens, happens; that, uh, I'll love this baby whether it's a boy or girl, whether it has a mental illness or not, and, uh, hopefully, it will be, it will be fine. Hello. (inaudible ). 

00:26:25
[music] 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN If Vanessa is as good a mother as I think of her, I'll be very happy. I think she will be. I think she'll be very good, and some of that blame might just disappear over the years, and she'll understand that you can't brew on things (inaudible ). 

00:27:00
[music] 

00:27:10
VANESSA At this point in my life, I've learned to drive, but I haven't yet taken the driver's test. It doesn't really seem to be so important anymore. I think, for now, I'll stick to steering my daughter's stroller and making sure that my kid gets a chance to know and love her aunt, and one thing is for sure: this kid is going to be a driver.
