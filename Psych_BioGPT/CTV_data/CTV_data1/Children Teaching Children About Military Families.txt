00:01:55
[music] 

00:02:05
Deployment 

00:02:05
RYLEE  When my father gets deployed for me, it means separation. I don't get to see him for a long period of time. 

00:02:10
KHIRA  It means to me when my father is going to be gone for a long time at war, and I don't know if he will be coming back or not. 

00:02:15
JOSIAH  Deployment was broken to me over a long, like couple of months. Like they -- like, what if questions. Like what if I went away for a year and eventually they told me that he was going to leave soon. 

00:02:35
KADEN  My father just kind of told me that he was gonna be gone for a really long time. And that he didn't know if he would be coming back or not. 

00:02:50
TATIANA  Um, it was actually kind of a secret. They were gonna tell me when the whole family was together but, um, I started talking about something that was gonna go on in August and my mom said something about my dad leaving and I was like, for how long? And she said for four months. And that was kind of devastating to know that I wouldn't see my dad for a whole four months. 

00:03:15
KHIRA  How I felt about the news is I kind of felt like it wouldn’t be long, that it would probably pass by faster than I thought because that's what I've been told. Then once he finally left I just kind of forgot about that and I was thinking like, oh, my Gosh, he's gonna be gone forever. 

00:03:30
JOSIAH  Not at the moment I didn't react, um, not until he left. That's when it kicked in. I'm like, whoa, he's actually gone. He's in danger, it's -- that's when it broke to me when he left. 

00:03:40
ADAM  When my stepdad goes out into the deployment it kind of makes me sad at first, but then I realize that he will be back, um, very soon and sooner than I think. 

00:03:50
ANNESSA  I felt really sad that he was going to be leaving for a while that I know that there is nothing that I could do to stop it and he really had to. 

00:04:00
GABRIEL  I felt a little worried for him and also a little bit sad. 

00:04:05
KADEN  I didn't really know how long a while meant so I was just waiting and when he didn't come back for a few days, I just kind of, -- well, did other things that take my mind off it. 

00:04:15
MEAGHAN  Well, when I first heard about it I was like, are you going away, again, and I don't really like it when my dad goes away because he goes away for a really long time and that's not very fun when he goes away. 

00:04:40
RYLEE  I feel kind of stunned, and I just kind of walked into my bedroom and just sat on my bed. You know, just thinking what's going on. 

00:04:55
ADAM  Some of my worries are that he might get hurt. Like a lot or people. I was watching the news and heard like a bunch of people died in a helicopter crash, all throughout our family, like -- 

00:05:05
ANNESSA  The number 1 worry going all through our family, like, is he going to get hurt. Is he going to die? 

00:05:20
GABRIEL  I'll worry that he might never come back and I was -- I was sad because I didn't want him to go. 

00:05:25
KADEN  My worries were, uh, where he was going, why he was going. And if it was dangerous. 

00:05:35
MEAGHAN  some of my worries were when my dad goes away for a long time, I'm worried that he won't come back, again. And it's very hard for me because I have little siblings and it's very hard to take care of them. 

00:05:45
KHIRA  Some of my worries were that I probably wouldn't be able to talk to them for a really long time. 

00:05:50
RYLEE  I was worried that I would never be able to see him. That he might not ever be able to come back. He might not come back at all. Um, he might -- maybe pass away over there. 

00:06:10
LEVI  I was worried that he wouldn't come back. 

00:06:15
KAYLA  I was scared and felt worried that he might get lost or get hurt or possibly killed. 

00:06:25
JOSIAH  I thought about him getting injured or being a prisoner of war. It was really scary. I was up at night, like what if he gets captured? What if he doesn't come back or what if he does with a life threatening injury or -- 

00:06:40
KAYLA  I heard in my mind gun shots and I heard like the artillery and I just thought about him being gone and was really scared. 

00:06:45
We Are Unique 

00:06:50
[music] 

00:07:00
ADAM  I don't know anyone from my school that's from a military family at all. Other families usually have their parents like every day and tuck them in bed and everything. But, not usually, me. I feel kind of sad that I don't get to have my family be with me 24/7. But it's yeah, sad, kind of. 

00:07:20
KADEN  Well, they don't really know what it's like to have a parent gone for a long long time. My dad was gone for two years. He's been deployed, um, like four times. 

00:07:30
KHIRA  When my dad was gone, at school, I'd be more of the quiet kid there. And it was just kind of hard on me. When I was thinking of him I was kind of thinking like, how many days were left until he'd come back and I'd just was really wondering what he was doing. And I just wanted to see him alive. 

00:07:45
RYLEE  I feel like I'm stronger than other kids that don't have military parents by, um, like, I feel, uh, closer to my family. Because I can see some kids with their families sometimes and their kids are always screaming at their parents. And for us it's like we scream, and it's like what just happened. It's not a think that we usually do and we always get along. When our parents get deployed we have to depend on each other more and more because there's not that one figure there to help depend so we have to fill the hole. 

00:08:20
KAYLA  I'm different because I know I'm shy, and I know more about the military but don't talk about it much because it makes me sad to think about it more. To think about him being gone. 

00:08:35
TATIANA  I think that I'm different in the fact that I've had a lot more challenges and opportunities than mainly the larger group of kids have had. When I learned that there was only one parent out of a hundred that works in the military that kind of hit me as, I’m really different from a lot of people. 

00:09:20
JOSIAH  Well, we kind of have that special something about us. Like that t-shirt that says, I survived that thing, yeah. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:50
[music] 

00:09:55
The Good & The Bad 

00:09:55
MEAGHAN  Well, some of the challenges are like when my dad goes away he won't come back for a very long time. And that's kind of hard for him so I have to take care of little siblings and make sure like my mom feels okay about when my dad goes away. Well, one of them is helping a lot with chores because my mom is very tired of doing them by herself. It kind of makes me feel sad when my mom does them and it kind of makes me feel happy because when I do my chores and my little siblings it means that I'm helping out in my family. 

00:10:30
ADAM  And all the chores get done as fast so I try to help my mom a lot more than I normally do. Um, and then we're moving all the time so -- once I move it's normally what a lot of people face is making new friends, getting to know the new school. Um, getting to know how to get around your new town. And then like as soon as you get all that stuff done you're practically moving again. So I moved about five or six times in my life. 

00:11:10
ANNESSA  The challenge is that when he left or it was really really hard like to take care of the littlest ones and I had to up my responsibility in the house. I had to make sure that I did everything almost right and it was kind of hard. 

00:11:25
GABRIEL  Some of the hard things are money loss. It's really hard. When my dad went to deploy he was gone for a year and so -- we lost a lot of money because we had to pay all the bills so our money went down so we only had enough for food and to help us get through the year. Like toys, that I really badly wanted and stuff like that. And now we're really slowly working our way back. 

00:11:50
KADEN  Some challenges are that sometimes he's gone for a very long time. Sometimes he visits for a couple of weeks. And, well, I just miss him a lot. It changes for me by like not having a dad there. It was hard for me because sometimes we would play basketball out in the front and I just kind of miss that, now. Uh, he was teaching me how to like work the computer a lot and, yeah. 

00:12:25
RYLEE  I'm scared that I may not be able to see them again. And I'm scared that, um, if they do come back we might have to move and one parent might not like that. And each year it just gets worse and worse and then parents might split up and siblings will get split up and there's so many worries that, um, I could go on, on an on. And like, siblings, siblings start to fight. I fight a lot with my siblings but when it comes down to the very core of us we never get broken up. If you try to break us up it would not go we.. Same with parents. Um, I have as step mom, not, I -- my parents got divorced when I was born. And so I lived with my mom for a couple of years and my dad got custody and my stepmom, she's been there ever since I can remember. And if you try to split us up it -- it wouldn't work at all. 

00:13:20
JOSIAH  Uh, definitely deployment is one of the challenges that we face. Um, also not being able to communicate sometimes. Like, if he's on a trip out in Iraq or just when he comes home he can't -- it's like classified or whatever and you can't really know what's going on over there. The longest time I've been without contact was about three weeks. It was scary. I thought something happened, um, I didn't know what was going on. 

00:14:00
TATIANA  Presenting yourself to the world as more of a confident person. When really you may not be the most confident. And so when you have to gain that kind of quality about yourself it -- it can be difficult. I don't think that's really all it. I think that just the fact that your parents are sometimes gone a lot more. When he's away, I have to help out more and I have to get used to that whole situation when he's away more work is put on my shoulders and I'm kind of like a second parent because he's away. so I have to get used to that and I have to get used to working instead of just sitting on the couch. 

00:14:40
KAYLA  Some of the hard parts was him being gone for my competitions or my big events. holidays, and not being able to hear him and see him. Well, every holiday he wasn't there. Every morning he would say, Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays and then when he was gone it was different. It felt really sad. 

00:15:15
ANNESSA  The good things are that like the next time you’re your parent gets deployed is that you know how to deal with it and you know what's going to happen. That sometimes when your friend is losing a parent during the school year then you can always comfort them and tell them how -- what the bright sides are. 

00:15:40
KADEN  Well, some benefits are that if you have the military ID, sometimes they give you, like a discounts on stuff or items. Things like that. 

00:15:55
MEAGHAN  The good things are that most families come back. Like if your dad or mom's away they usually come back to see you and it's good because they're helping keep our country safe. 

00:16:10
RYLEE  What's fun about being in a military family is you really get to have more experiences. You get to learn about what people over there are doing. I like to talk about, uh, army stuff a lot because I know a lot about it. 

00:16:20
TATIANA  I get to not only face challenges and kind of get rid of them but I also get to learn new things and do new things and it's just a great thing to be a military kid. It's just kind of getting over your fears and gaining more and better qualities about yourself. 

00:16:35
JOSIAH  My favorite benefits are going to awesome camps. Like, Operation Purple Camp. Um, sometimes we get those discounts to like Disney World or whatever, or restaurants. That's nice. 

00:16:55
KHIRA  I get to know a lot about what my dad did and he has all these videos of what he did. And probably just getting to see him. Because once your parent's gone for a really long time then you realize how much you really do love them. 

00:17:10
What Helps 

00:17:15
[music] 

00:17:20
JOSIAH  What supports me is my family, my church, my community, they -- they definitely do a lot. They try to support us. A couple of times they've cooked us meals to help us go by. Something that really stood out to me was when my church, they did a whole service about it and they had all the kids like write cards to our family and they threw us like a big surprise party and everything. And that was cool. What I do is, uh, journal. That -- that helps me a lot. I like to do sports. That takes my mind off of things so I can concentrate on it and -- 

00:18:05
MEAGHAN  One of the supports the helps me a lot and my friends, like if I'm having a hard time and I'm at school, my friends usually come and help me. Well, they help me by talking to me, like it's okay. I've had that problem before when my dad or mom went away for a very long time on a business trip. My mom helps me because she's gone through this before and she usually communicates a lot with me and we figure out some way that we can speak to my parent that's in the military. 

00:18:45
ANNESSA  Well I look forward to my dad coming back home so the bad thing was that he left, but then I knew, once it was over he'd come back and we'd get to be together again. 

00:18:55
KADEN My dad, he teaches martial arts. I've learned how to keep cool and not really think of him all that much when he's gone. So I do other like fun things. So I won't think of him a lot. I go to movies, I play video games and I hang out with my friends. My mom helps support me. She tells me that it's all gonna be all right. sometimes when I'm feeling down, she takes me out places. My sister helps support me, also. She hangs out with me. She plays games with me. She plays basketball when I'm feeling lonely. 

00:19:30
KAYLA  What helps support me during difficult times is being around another military kid. And going to places like JJ Jump. We get to go there over Christmas, a whole bunch of military kids are there and so they play with us and find out what we're suffering too. Being there will all the kids and seeing and hearing their lives and their stories. Too. It helps me feel more comforted. 

00:19:50
TATIANA  Um, my friends and my parents, mainly help support me. They make me laugh. They always have really good things to say about me and about my family and just things that will help me get through. Even the longest times when he's away, so -- 

00:20:15
LEVI  What helps me feel better is looking at pictures of my dad. He would always send me little pictures. 

00:20:30
RYLEE  My stepmom helped support us a lot. Um, she really tries to be nicer. Um, especially when he's gone she gives us a lot more freedom. You want to go over to your friend's house, um, be back before dark. You know, just stuff like that she always tries to give up her little extra fund time and spend it with us and help make sure that we have a lot of fun. 

00:20:55
ADAM  My, um, little five-year-old brother who is very enthusiastic, like he doesn't even know that his dad's gone. He just thinks he's like not here right now. And he doesn't have a worry and just seeing him be so fun and playful makes me want to be fun and playful. 

00:21:35
What I Would Change 

00:21:35
KHIRA  The only thing I'd want to change about when he gets deployed is to not be gone for so long. 

00:21:40
KADEN  I would change the deployment so it's only once in a while. Only like one or two times every two years. The deployment should last for at the most a month. 

00:21:55
MEAGHAN  I would like to change like the seasons when they leave because it's kind of sad when they leave for my birthday and the holidays. I don’t really like it when they leave for that. Maybe somewhere like, in between holidays that aren't really close together. So maybe Easter and Christmas, that would be a good time. 

00:22:15
RYLEE  If I had to change something about his deployments I would probably change the fact that he gets put in such a scary position. I would be okay with him going over there. I can understand the -- the serving for a country, that's really important. If he didn't do it nobody else would. But, um, if I had to change it maybe put him in a safer place. 

00:22:30
TATIANA  I'm the kind of person that I don’t like it when they come back and then they have to leave again. Because it's the same thing over. It's good to see them again but at the same time I don't like seeing them and then having to go through the same thing, okay, you've just come back. Now, you're going to leave again. I don't want to have to go through the whole thing where we have to take him to the airport and then everybody's balling and stuff. And so I just like to get it done and over with. 

00:23:00
JOSIAH  A leave is when, uh, parent comes back form the deployment for like a vacation. It's usually like two weeks. Where you can just, um, catch up on things and -- I wish that the leave would be a lot longer because when he came back it seemed way to short. 

00:23:15
MEAGHAN  I would like people to know that, uh, so when your parents go away for a long time you should always love them no matter where they go. Love is the best thing that you should always have and the other thing is to have connection with them wherever you go or wherever they go it's really nice to have connection. 

00:23:30
RYLEE  Um, the hardest part that I would want them to know about is most likely that they should, um, should know, how much it makes me sad to, um, have my dad gone and stepdad. I really want people to know and feel the pain and like suffering that you have to go through and sadness and everything. I would pretty much say that it is, um, very hard and it -- it can hurt inside. 

00:23:50
KADEN I would tell them that they would not want to be in military family and it's very hard. The parts that are hard it's when they're gone, you just really miss them a lot. 

00:24:25
KHIRA  What I want them to know about -- is that it's not always easy on you because when you have a military family you either have your mom or your dad gone. And when you have a parent gone then you're kind of like, oh, no. Where's my mom? Where's my dad? So you're kind of lost for a couple of days and once you actually realize that they're gone then they're kind of all like sad and gloomy. For me it was really sad that my dad was gone. 

00:24:55
RYLEE  I would tell people that, um, it is super hard. It's all about remembering why you have a parent deployed and what they did for you. 

00:25:15
TATIANA  I think we just need to let them know who we are as people and, um, what we do and what our parents do. 

00:25:30
RYLEE I want especially like the middle schoolers to know that it's not all about shooting and killing people. I hate it when people do that. They'll be like, oh, did your dad shoot someone? And I'm like, well, even if he did, why would you be proud of that? Like it's not cool. 

00:25:40
Homecoming 

00:25:45
[music] 

00:26:00
KADEN  When my dad comes back home I feel very excited. I just like hug him a lot and the minute I get home I ask him if we can play basketball. 

00:26:05
ADAM  Well, normally when I see my stepdad for the first time after he's been deployed, I will run up to him and give him a big hug and a kiss. 

00:26:15
KHIRA  When my dad comes back home from being away for a really long time I'm really happy and I have a lot of tears of joy. And it's just really fun to have him back. 

00:26:45
ADAM  When he comes back home it's very exciting and I'm very happy about it and we will go out and have a very nice expensive dinner, somewhere that we really like. 

00:26:55
MEAGHAN  I feel really excited and really happy that he's back because I like it when my dad comes back. He acts really happy that I came back home. I come and hug him a lot. 

00:27:20
RYLEE  When my dad comes home for me, um, I can't stop smiling for some reason and just I -- like I'm in the car and I'm like be serious. You know, show him that you've matured and then I get out of the car and it's just constant sn -- like just constant smiles and happiness. 

00:27:30
MEAGHAN  One time when I was at my house we were ready to be like have my dad come home. And so he came home that day and so we were all excited so we had this little, um, back together party and we went to like lunch together and we did some fun things. 

00:27:55
LEVI  One of my favorite moments was when my dad came home. Like seeing him walk out of the building where he was staying. Um, like just seeing him walk towards us it was like so joyful. It was awesome. Like I couldn’t even -- there's no words that can describe it. It's -- you laugh, you cry, you scream, you shout. It's like all of that combined into one event. It -- it's like the best day of your life. It's awesome. 

00:28:30
KADEN  Sometimes it's difficult when he comes home because I'm getting used to having only one parent. 

00:28:40
KHIRA  When he comes back home we usually have like a couple of days to just reunite and usually we go do something fun altogether. Or we meet up with family. And then sometimes like we’ll have all of our family and friends together and we'll just have a bit party. 

00:29:05
RYLEE  The adjustment period when he comes back home is extremely difficult. Because things change. He's very strict. Step -- my stepmom's not. So, um, you know, she always makes sure she has us tightly bound but not as much as him. So it's super hard to get used to it because he always does things differently. Dinner, exactly this time. Um, her, maybe 10 minutes late, 10 minutes earlier. Just as long as we get it done as a family. And, uh, chores. You know, you get used to the same thing and, um, everything has to just scramble up and try and mix it up how it was before. 

00:29:45
KHIRA  He seemed different because he seemed more like really really happy all the time. He would sometimes just kind of like not really care about a lot of things. And then, um, it was just kind of harder on me and my little sister, probably because my little sister hasn't seen -- he's only been with her for half of her life. And it -- I feel more bad for him because it's hard for him. 

00:30:10
KADEN  He seems really stressed out when he comes home, for some reason. Um, over time he gets happier. And then I think there's always that fear in the back of his mind that he always has to go back. 

00:30:25
TATIANA  When he was gone for the four months I just hadn't seen him for so long that I didn't really know what to expect when he came back. I didn't really know what to say to him. So that was different but I got when he -- when he came back I ran up to him and I -- I gave him a hug and stuff. It was -- it was really nice being able to see him, again. I don't know he -- we just kind of make things go a little bit slower than they have been and kind of have him adjust from getting back from some place that he may have been working really hard in. Just give him a time to actually relax and get used to being back with his family and stuff. and have us get used to the same things so -- 

00:31:30
[music] 

00:31:35
Advice to Kids 

00:31:35
ADAM  Um, advice I would give to other kids is they'll be back sooner than you think and it's okay to cry. 

00:31:45
ANNESSA  I'd give advice of always have faith in that your parent will return safely. 

00:31:55
KADEN  I would give them advice saying just stay calm. They will come back. Stay strong. 

00:32:05
KHIRA  I would give them advice that, you know, to always think about why they're doing and that they're doing it for a really good cause for our nation. And that they only want to try to help. 

00:32:15
ANNESSA My mom, she said that -- that's it's always okay to cry because back then I always held it in. It's helpful to cry because what -- after you cry then it's really starting to get out of your system. 

00:32:30
RYLEE  It might be a little bit harsh but, um, don't get attached until you know you're for sure not, um, going to stay the place you are. Because it's really hard leaving the school and the friends and the military can change that but that just make you stronger and different than people. 

00:32:45
MEAGHAN  I'd say, um, so if your parents go away for a long time it's good to have connection and like talk to them a lot. And it's good to love them all the time. 

00:33:00
TATIANA  People who don't know a lot about the military may say things like, Oh, my Gosh, I'm so sorry that your dad's leaving for so long. We're used to it. We can tough it out. I just kind of -- I realize that they don't know a lot about how -- what that's like. And how many times it's happened. But -- so I kind of try to respect that about people. And, um, help them to understand what it -- what it is like when they don't really know. 

00:33:40
KAYLA  The advice that I would give is to take a lot of pictures before they go and to maybe go on, um, a vacation. 

00:33:55
JOSIAH  I -- I like to do journaling. Well, you can like write that thing that nobody else knows. It's like personal. Like you don't have to share it with your dad. You don’t have to share it with your mom. It -- it's -- it feels like you're talking to someone but you're not. That’s what I like about it. 

00:34:25
RYLEE  You get that warm feeling that, you know, my parent went over there for me. For my country and, uh, they helped me, in particularly. They tried to do this for my family. And just be happy for them about that. 

00:34:45
LEVI Find good outlets for anger if you have that, which I did. Um, Tae Kwon Do really helped, um, to take our your anger on the punching bags. And, um, find good outlets for venting. 

00:34:50
GABRIEL  Usually what we do is we just try and deal with -- deal with the bumps. Try and smooth the bumps out. 

00:34:55
ADAM  I don't think there's really much more advice other than stay strong. 

00:35:00
Advice to Parents 

00:35:05
[music] 

00:35:10
KAYLA  My advice to other parents would be to find other military families and get your kids to play with them and hear about their stories. 

00:35:15
ANNESSA  Um, like spend some more time with them before and like before you leave give them -- give them a little pep talk, like, tell them that everything's going to be all right. 

00:35:25
KADEN  I would tell the military parents to ease up on them a bit because sometimes their being insensitive. Like they should ease up on the kids crying because some really strict parents when their kids cry about them leaving they say, hey, stop that. And they're being insensitive. I think kids should be able to express their feelings. 

00:35:55
KHIRA  Probably before they go is just to tell them that they love them and that they're always thinking of them because that's what my dad always told me. He told me that he always missed me and that he loves me a lot. 

00:36:00
LEVI I would tell other parents advice to take a lot of pictures of them before they get deployed. 

00:36:05
MEAGHAN  I would get that advice. Maybe have like certain camps set up that maybe they can go to or have like friends come and sleep over or have them go to a sleepover. So that way they could usually have someone, maybe who has the same problem as them and they could maybe talk about what they can do better. 

00:36:15
RYLEE  I would tell them to tell their kids like that it will only get better and just make them more happy. Try and do one extra thing every day to make them happy. 

00:36:55
JOSIAH  Keep in touch with them at least once a week. Because if it's any longer than that you -- you start to worry a lot. You're like, oh, what's happening? Where did he go? And try not to be too dramatic even if it is realistic. Um, kind of stretch the truth. 

00:37:20
RYLEE  No promises but always reassure them that over time it could get better. It will get better. If they come back or not and try not to bring that up. Just try and make sure they know that it will all be better. 

00:37:35
JOSIAH  The parent at home, I think should comfort them a lot more. Um, like if they're scared that they should, um, help them out. You know, let them sleep next to them at night if they're scared or -- 

00:37:50
KHIRA  I would say that it's just as hard for the kids as it is for the parents but sometimes it can be harder for the kids because they're just kids. 

00:38:00

00:38:05
If I Had a Magic Wand 

00:38:05
KAYLA  If I had a magic wand I would go on a family vacation to Europe. I would take a lot of pictures and just be with my family. 

00:38:15
KADEN  If I had a magic wand I would make it so there is world peace and no more wars. 

00:38:20
GABRIEL  Probably keep it in my little chest. Keep it in there until I really needed it. If my dad was injured and they don't know if he could get healed I'd take it out and see if it could help my dad get -- have the changes of healing. 

00:38:35
KHIRA  I would probably make it easier on all military families because it's hard. 

00:38:45
MEAGHAN  I would make my dad come back home because I miss him so much when he leaves. 

00:38:50
RYLEE  If I had a magic wand I would stop everything, just make time freeze and just think what would I do and then I would make no more war. I would just think, no more war. If there were no more wars I would want my dad to get just a regular job. Uh, it doesn't have to be anything fancy but a good stable job. 

00:39:15
RYLEE  I would probably make army base homes a little bit bigger because they are smaller. And for people who have to live in an army base that is very hard. I would give people bigger living space because that -- that would be a big thing. And it's kind of like living in an apartment with five people, one bedroom. It -- it's very small and it's hard to do. 

00:39:50
JOSIAH  If I had a magic wand, um, I'd probably create world peace. It would stop wars, murders, suicide and it patch up greed which would also help world hunger. So if I had a magic wand I'd create world peace.

00:41:05
KHIRA  I'm proud that my family has stayed strong when he's been gone and when we have a lot of accomplishments because our family kind of falls apart, reunites and falls apart again. So it's hard on all of us.

00:41:45
KADEN  I'm proud of my dad because he goes off and fights for our country.

00:42:50
TATIANA  I don't mean to brag or anything but I'm really proud that I've become a way better person because he's in the military and, uh, because I get to do so many things and because I get to meet new people and learn new things. It's just a really great opportunity. 

00:43:05
JOSIAH  I'm proud I have survived this deployment. Like, it seemed like forever. I'm proud that I 'm doing well in school. 

00:43:15
GABRIEL  I'm proud that my dad is willing to risk his life for other people even if they're someone that doesn't thing that the army can do what they're supposed to do and not keep this country free. He's still willing to risk his life to keep his country free.
