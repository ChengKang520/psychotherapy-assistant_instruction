00:00:00
JON CARLSON  Well, I'm Jon Carlson. And, I'm glad you guys are with us. You're Leslie? 

00:00:25
LESLIE Leslie. 

00:00:25
JON CARLSON And, Scott. Right. Good. And, you are both very kind that you went through and you filled out some forms for me that, ah, help me understand a little bit about you, guys. And, if I understand things right, you're 31 and you're 38 right now. And, you guys, have got three children. Ah, you got a set of twins. 

00:00:45
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:00:45
JON CARLSON  Ah, they're both 10, and then, you've got a six-year-old? 

00:00:50
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:00:50
JON CARLSON So, you got all the kids in school right now. And, maybe you can each tell me in your own words what's going on that you wanna work on? And, what is happening that you don't like? 

00:01:05
LESLIE In my own words?(laughter) 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:01:10
LESLIE Ah, we are going through some tough times, and the marriage really burst. 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON Can you talk about why they are though for you? What makes him tough for you? 

00:01:20
LESLIE What makes him tough for me? 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:01:20
LESLIE  Uhm, you know, his anger and his temper really is getting very tough for me. 

00:01:30
JON CARLSON So, if it was in one word for you, it would be temper or anger... (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON ...either one of those words will do? 

00:01:40
LESLIE Okay. 

00:01:40
JON CARLSON How about for you, Scott? 

00:01:40
SCOTT  Attitude. 

00:01:45
JON CARLSON Attitude with a big A... (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
SCOTT One... (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
JON CARLSON ...big capital A (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:01:47
SCOTT ...one word, yeah. 

00:01:47
JON CARLSON  And, what do you mean by attitude? 

00:01:50
SCOTT Her attitude towards me. And, I'm, I know, I bring it on. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Well. 

00:01:55
SCOTT It's my, it's my temper, I know about my temper and... (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
SCOTT ...it's not something I can't just turn off. 

00:02:05
JON CARLSON And, what's the best solution, you guys, have found so far? 

00:02:10
LESLIE We haven't. 

00:02:10
JON CARLSON No? 

00:02:10
LESLIE No. 

00:02:10
SCOTT (inaudible ) one of us gotta go. (laughing) 

00:02:15
LESLIE We haven't found a solution. 

00:02:15
JON CARLSON So, but one thing is little better is if one of you leaves? 

00:02:20
SCOTT Yeah, it seems to be okay, huh? 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON  Yeah, okay. 

00:02:25
SCOTT Right at the moment, I'm not at home. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Okay. So currently, that's the solution that you guys were not living together right now? 

00:02:30
LESLIE Currently, yes. It's only been a week. But, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:02:35
SCOTT What we plan to. 

00:02:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh, and does that help? You maybe done this before? 

00:02:40
LESLIE Uh uh. 

00:02:40
SCOTT Uh uh. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON Or this is a first time? 

00:02:40
SCOTT That's right. 

00:02:40
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON  Okay. So, that must mean that things would probably at their loads right now? 

00:02:45
LESLIE Yeah, I would think so. 

00:02:50
JON CARLSON Ah, okay. And, what do you, each think, I mean, you each said that the part that I don't like is, you know, his anger and, and her attitude. What do you think your role is in this? I mean, if you had to put in your own words what do you contribute to the problem? 

00:03:05
LESLIE  I'm sure I contribute a lot really, it's totally but it's still his, his temper and how easily and fast he gets mad is still ah... (crosstalk) 

00:03:20
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
LESLIE ...is still a hard thing to deal with because it's not only between the two of us, you know, the kids can make him angry too. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
LESLIE ...so. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
JON CARLSON So, what's your role, though, he is getting angry with what? I mean, see what often had a pretty good picture of what our partners role is, but it's kinda nice to look back on yourself. What would you guess your role is? He says attitude. 

00:03:40
LESLIE  Oh, yeah. 

00:03:45
JON CARLSON (laughter) Oh, yeah. 

00:03:45
LESLIE  Yeah, I, I do have an attitude when things start going wrong. I do get an attitude and I argue back. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON So, is that what an attitude would mean to you? She was arguing back? 

00:04:00
SCOTT Yeah, pretty much, pretty much...(crosstalk) 

00:04:05
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:04:05
SCOTT ...she argues back and just spiteful. 

00:04:10
JON CARLSON  You're in agreement? What does spiteful mean? 

00:04:15
LESLIE (laughter) I don't feel that I'm spiteful. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
SCOTT  Uh-huh. 

00:04:20
LESLIE You know, I won't take a revenge or anything like that. I don't feel that I'm that way. 

00:04:20
JON CARLSON  Okay. 

00:04:25
LESLIE You know, I just tried to prove a point to him if he's acting a certain way especially where the kids are involved; I try and get him to see it... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
JON CARLSON And, and ah... (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
LESLIE On my way, really. 

00:04:35
JON CARLSON ..how does it work? 

00:04:35
SCOTT Yeah, your way. 

00:04:35
LESLIE It doesn't work. 

00:04:35
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:35
SCOTT Because it has to be her way. 

00:04:40
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON Ah, so you, the, the idea is to prove a point, I mean, prove a point means my way? Seeing it my way? 

00:04:45
LESLIE Well, seeing it from other than the way he's seeing it. (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
JON CARLSON I understand. 

00:04:50
LESLIE You know, if he's treating a certain individual on a household the certain way, and what I would consider it being damaging, you know, I would like him to see that. 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON Okay. And, when that's going on, is it, that's, that's a time that you take for a teaching moment, to try to teach him and help him learn something? (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
LESLIE No, it's more like an argument. 

00:05:10
JON CARLSON All right. So. (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
SCOTT No, there's no teaching and all that stuff. 

00:05:10
JON CARLSON  Uh-huh. 

00:05:15
SCOTT When she tells me I'm acting (laughter) uhm, pretty much like an ass and... (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON Yeah? 

00:05:20
SCOTT ...and she's gonna let me know. 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON I see. (crosstalk). 

00:05:20
SCOTT Let's see, what I'm trying to do, when something like that happens, I, I really wanted to get, get away from it all. 

00:05:30
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:05:30
SCOTT From, from her, the kids... (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
JON CARLSON Ah. 

00:05:35
SCOTT ...and whoever else it might be. 

00:05:35
JON CARLSON Okay. I think I understand this. Where did you, guys, learn this from? 

00:05:40
SCOTT What? The temper? 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON Who, yeah, what to do? You know, I mean, because this is always a learning behavior. 

00:05:45
SCOTT Well, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
LESLIE I have no idea. 

00:05:45
JON CARLSON All right. 

00:05:45
SCOTT  Well, my getting up is do something that I have started... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:05:55
SCOTT ...since we've been together, because I, I I shouldn't have tell her what's gonna happen like if I really get going. 

00:06:00
JON CARLSON Yeah. Well, I'm thinking where did you get learn to, see when we have frustrations, we learn to handle frustration in a certain way, and sounds like you, when, when somebody is frustrated, you should get angry. And it sounds like, you know, you get frustrated, you've learned that you need to keep talking. This is it. The grin was what sometimes is called a recognition reflex. It's a, so, you, can you think where you learn those from now? I mean, often we learn these things from parents. 

00:06:40
LESLIE Uh-huh, it could be. I was taught to talk, talk things out, work things out. 

00:06:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:06:45
LESLIE You know, not necessarily fight but to work things out, and talk things through. 

00:06:50
JON CARLSON How about from your ends, Scott? 

00:06:50
SCOTT  I would say to them that the temper and all, I mean, that's an, that's just a, I've always saw there was a natural thing, its counts. There's a lot of other people and my, and my family that have a hot temper. 

00:07:05
JON CARLSON Okay. So, you've observed that when you grew up and you watched that that was how people solve problems? 

00:07:15
SCOTT Well, not really solve anything. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON (laughter) Okay. (coughing)But that's how people attempt to do solve problems. 

00:07:20
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON I find there are a lot of times couples don't have a very good problem-solving strategies, and what they do is they keep trying the same one over and over again. And it probably didn't work for their parents, and it isn't really gonna work for them. But, they really don't have any other ones. And, I don't know if that makes any sense to you, guys. 

00:07:45
LESLIE (cough)Absolutely. 

00:07:45
JON CARLSON Yeah, and, and so, you keep trying harder to do the things you're doing, and yet they really don't work. And, one of the things we might think about is there anything else that you could do when you're getting in a situation like that. I mean, an example you gave was a trouble with the kids, ah, where evidently Scott is doing something. Can, can you think of a specific time that this happened, and what you did and then what he did, and then what happened? 

00:08:15
LESLIE Are you talking about as far as like, when the kids did something wrong? 

00:08:20
JON CARLSON Well or something that you guys doing out is wrong? (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
SCOTT  As I told, just give me, for instance, one week, just a week ago, two weeks ago. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON  The one that led you separated? 

00:08:30
SCOTT Uh hmm. That's it. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
LESLIE Uh hmm. Well, that, that, that's been, this has been leading up for years, first of all, the, with the separating, but. (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
JON CARLSON And my guess as you would probably push a little the button and, you know, play argument number seven. 

00:08:40
LESLIE  Yeah. 

00:08:45
JON CARLSON That's there kind of a pattern, (laughter) kind of a thing that you get into. 

00:08:45
LESLIE  Yeah, but, yeah, whenever, if the kids do something wrong, I was not, I wasn't raised in a household with, I don't know, violence or whatever, you know. 

00:08:55
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:55
LESLIE And I feel that there's certain ways to discipline kids. 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
LESLIE And I think he comes close if not crosses the line in where it's excessive, and I... (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
LESLIE  of course, I interfere. My job is to protect my children as their mother. (laughter) So. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JON CARLSON I, I, okay. 

00:09:15
LESLIE And then, we end up getting into an argument because of how he handles a certain situation or whatever it may be. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON Well, what led up to this... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
SCOTT I want room. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON ...you know, the specific one? 

00:09:30
SCOTT Well, we were, we have ah, situation we have to talk about, her and I. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON Ah. 

00:09:40
SCOTT It has to do with the kids. 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:40
SCOTT When we're trying to talk privately, I send the two big ones out. Wha, he actually comes out because back in the house, Tyler is in the house. Christopher is out bumping around and doing something. 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:09:55
SCOTT And Ashley and Tyler just won't leave us alone. And we finally sent them away. 

00:10:05
DR. JON CARLSON We or? 

00:10:05
SCOTT The two of us. 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON Okay. So that was something you agreed on? 

00:10:05
LESLIE  Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
SCOTT And we just sent them away, we had to talk. It was something that was pretty important. 

00:10:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:10:10
SCOTT And ah, I'm having a little bit of a hard time accepting and dealing with that problem and, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
JON CARLSON Ah, wait, I'm not sure which problem. The problem, the problem that you guys were talking about? 

00:10:25
SCOTT Yeah. (inaudible ) 

00:10:27
JON CARLSON Okay, that's fine. 

00:10:27
SCOTT All right. Are you sure you don't have anything to tell him? 

00:10:27
LESLIE  No, I don't think so. You just go ahead with those issues. 

00:10:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. You, you talk her out. It's okay.(crosstalk) 

00:10:30
SCOTT But anyway, we, ah, I'm trying to talk her out. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:10:35
SCOTT And Christopher and Ashley and Tyler, (inaudible ) just making us frustrated. 

00:10:40
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
SCOTT And Ashley finally was sent away and she went into the dining room, was doing something there. And Tyler was sent up to his room. He ran out. "Hey, I hate you guys. I don't love you guys anymore, you guys," And all those stuff. "Ash, come here." I gave him a hug and a kiss. Was lying, I was sitting on the sofa with him. And uh, he wouldn't wound up. He'd come and he ended up jumping up on my legs. 

00:11:05
LESLIE  And? 

00:11:10
SCOTT I jumped up. I grabbed my shoes off of the floor and my T-shirt, and I went to go outside. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
LESLIE It, it wasn't that simple. He jumped up. He was hollering... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
SCOTT Hollering. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
LESLIE ...and swearing and yelling at Tyler, which is a 6-year old for what he had done and then... (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
LESLIE ...I feel he threw a 2-year old temper tantrums at that point. But then when he went to go walk out the door, my daughter who was gonna go outside and he started yelling at her. (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
SCOTT I. 

00:11:35
LESLIE And she had nothing to do with the situation. 

00:11:35
SCOTT Well, the thing was, if she wouldn't go away, and she was asked to go so we could talk. 

00:11:40
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
SCOTT  She, she bothered us, Tyler bothered us. And I, I don't think I directly swore at Tyler or anything. I got up and I was swearing about the whole incident. 

00:11:55
JON CARLSON So, I'm not sure if I get this right. You're having a really emotional topic that you guys have to work on? 

00:12:00
SCOTT Uh-huh. 

00:12:00
LESLIE Yes. 

00:12:00
JON CARLSON So, you're probably worked up a little bit anyway. It's kind of... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
SCOTT Oh, yeah. I was definitely worked up over it. 

00:12:05
JON CARLSON ...you're just gonna have a discussion. And then, the kids bother you in talking about this issue. And then another child bothers you. 

00:12:10
SCOTT And... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
LESLIE Yeah. 

00:12:10
SCOTT ...and I went out of the house. And now, Ashley won't leave us alone. I'm going outside. She (inaudible ) And I said, "I'm going outside." And she says, "I wanna go with you." "No, you're not. You just stay in the house like you were told and now leave us alone." And that's it. I'm going outside to get away from you guys. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
LESLIE But, it's not that simple. You holler and you scream and you swear at them. And you call them names. And you get in this bridge(ph) and everything. And all she wanted to do was to go outside. Not necessarily to be by you. She wanted out.(crosstalk) 

00:12:40
SCOTT Yeah. But she wouldn't go outside when she needed to. 

00:12:40
JON CARLSON And so then, this is the time where you become really reasonable? 

00:12:45
LESLIE Well, I asked him why he was yelling at her.(crosstalk) 

00:12:45
SCOTT No, she wasn't reasonable. 

00:12:45
LESLIE I asked him why he was yelling at her. She didn't do anything to him. She just happened to pass him in the hallway and. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
SCOTT But she's gonna go outside... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. (coughs) 

00:12:55
SCOTT ...now if dad's going outside. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
JON CARLSON Hmm. 

00:13:00
SCOTT And she was asked to go out earlier. And there, with her not going outside and doing what she was asked to do was part of the frustration. 

00:13:05
LESLIE But your frustration wasn't with her. See... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON I see. Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
LESLIE ...this is just one incident. If he's frustrated with something that's not even, not even a person, let's say, something falls out of a cabinet. He gets frustrated. He carries on with his what I call a temper tantrum. And the very next thing that walks into the room whether it be the dog or one of the kids or myself, he turns in at, you know, he's turned on that person now at that time. And I, I think it's wrong. 

00:13:30
JON CARLSON  So how does that work for you, guys? 

00:13:35
LESLIE It doesn't work. 

00:13:35
JON CARLSON Well? 

00:13:35
SCOTT  No, it's not working at all. 

00:13:40
JON CARLSON Well, it works in some way, though. We usually do things that somehow work for us. 

00:13:45
SCOTT It's vented. It's venting on my part. 

00:13:45
JON CARLSON  I mean, so how would, what would be different if, uhm, you know, this problem wasn't there any more? 

00:13:55
SCOTT Like? 

00:13:55
LESLIE On this new, this problem. (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
JON CARLSON No, no, no. I don't mean the one that you were talking about. But the way that you dealt with one another. So, if you were to wake up in the morning and his anger was gone or your attitude was gone, then what? 

00:14:05
LESLIE  Things would be very different. 

00:14:10
JON CARLSON How so? 

00:14:10
SCOTT Hmm. If you knew(ph) who you live with. 

00:14:15
JON CARLSON Well? 

00:14:15
LESLIE  It's a mutual feeling.(laughter) 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON Huh? 

00:14:20
LESLIE I said it's a mutual feeling. It's, it's hard living with somebody with a temper. (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
JON CARLSON Well, well, okay, but so the, the advantage of this then is that you live in struggle? There's always a struggle that you, you don't have an easy life? 

00:14:30
SCOTT I wouldn't say always. But a lot of times, there's a struggle. 

00:14:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. So, that's why you do this? To keep life interesting? 

00:14:40
SCOTT No. 

00:14:40
LESLIE No. 

00:14:40
SCOTT No. It's just, it's, it's kept interesting because this happens. 

00:14:45
LESLIE I wish, I wish we could all change. That's what I want. 

00:14:50
JON CARLSON But, but then you'd have to be close together. 

00:14:50
LESLIE What do you mean? 

00:14:55
JON CARLSON Well, if you weren't acting like this, wouldn't you be very close together with one another? 

00:14:55
LESLIE  We probably would be. 

00:15:00
JON CARLSON Would that be a good thing? 

00:15:00
LESLIE It probably would be. 

00:15:05
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. Now, have you had that before in your lives? 

00:15:05
LESLIE  Back when I say back before when the kids were very small. 

00:15:10
JON CARLSON And so early in your marriage, uh, when you guys were, uhm, maybe infatuated a little bit with one another then? 

00:15:20
LESLIE Hmm, maybe, yeah, even beyond the infatuation, I would think. 

00:15:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. And why was that right? I mean, how did you guys live differently at that time? How could have, how could you live. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
SCOTT How do we live differently? 

00:15:30
JON CARLSON Yeah. (laughter) Well? And what was different about then? 

00:15:35
LESLIE  When the kids were younger, there wasn't too much to make him angry? 

00:15:40
JON CARLSON So, what did you do then if you didn't argue? 

00:15:45
LESLIE  What do you mean? 

00:15:50
JON CARLSON Well, how did you, did you talk? Did you... (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:15:50
JON CARLSON ...play games? I mean how did you spend your time? 

00:15:55
SCOTT When they're little, we were working?(laughter) 

00:16:00
LESLIE Yeah, we worked a lot. 

00:16:00
SCOTT I, I was working a lot. 

00:16:00
LESLIE Well, we spend good time with each other and with the kids doing whatever. You know, even if it was watching movies on the TV or whatever. Just going somewhere. 

00:16:10
JON CARLSON I see. And so now, (cough) somewhere along the line, you get into this role of having these temper outbursts? And then you get into this role being kind of a critic? 

00:16:25
LESLIE I won't. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
SCOTT She's more like a referee. 

00:16:25
LESLIE People. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
JON CARLSON Referee, hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
LESLIE Yeah, that's what I feel... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
JON CARLSON And, and... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
LESLIE ...I feel like I had to referee what's going on.(crosstalk) 

00:16:30
JON CARLSON ...and what would happen if you won't stop that? 

00:16:35
LESLIE Somebody is going to get hurt. 

00:16:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. And what would happen if somebody got hurt? 

00:16:40
SCOTT Oh... (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
LESLIE I. 

00:16:40
SCOTT ...I'd be in jail. 

00:16:40
LESLIE He'd be in jail. 

00:16:40
JON CARLSON Uh- huh. So, you appreciate what she does? 

00:16:45
SCOTT If I was hurting somebody, I would say something, but. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON I mean, are you likely to hurt one of the kids... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
SCOTT Not the kids, no. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
JON CARLSON if she, oh, so you. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
SCOTT No, I'm not gonna outright just hurt one of the kids. 

00:17:00
LESLIE He may not do it on purpose, but when he loses his temper and loses... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
LESLIE ... his... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
SCOTT I, my temper... (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
LESLIE ...frame of thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
SCOTT ... ah, I've had people, uh, her father for one told me he's never seen anything like my temper before. 

00:17:15
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. So, this is probably one of the things that you, you're best at? This having a temper? 

00:17:20
SCOTT  I don't know if I'm. (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
JON CARLSON I mean, you're known for this? 

00:17:25
SCOTT Oh, I have been for the last ten years, anyway. 

00:17:30
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
SCOTT And now that there was, I didn't, didn't take a whole lot from, from people younger. 

00:17:35
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
SCOTT You know, when I was younger, I didn't take a whole lot of this. 

00:17:35
JON CARLSON  Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
SCOTT  No lip, I didn't. (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
JON CARLSON Uh-huh, okay it sounds like that's still sort of what happens when the kids have lip right now, you don't take much? 

00:17:50
SCOTT Well, it's ah, a lip. I can take a, I can take someone, some of it but... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:17:55
SCOTT  if they don't do what they're told. 

00:18:00
JON CARLSON Ah. 

00:18:00
SCOTT You know, I... (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
JON CARLSON And then what's, what goes on after?(crosstalk) 

00:18:00
SCOTT  I don't, I don't want, I don't want to beat on the kids. 

00:18:05
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:18:05
SCOTT You know. You know, you don't, you just don't beat kids. 

00:18:10
LESLIE But you have physically grab them, yank on their arms, start beating, you know, whatever. 

00:18:15
SCOTT  Yeah. Maybe I'm going where I'm supposed to be going. 

00:18:20
LESLIE I don't think you need to be physical like that.(crosstalk) 

00:18:20
SCOTT Or make them go upstairs or something like that. 

00:18:25
JON CARLSON So, the part that when he gets physical, that's when he steps over your line for you? 

00:18:30
LESLIE Yes. Well, sometimes with his, a lot of times with his words. And then, what he gets to the physical part. 

00:18:35
JON CARLSON So how far did you let him go? 

00:18:35
LESLIE  Now? Not far at all.(laughter) 

00:18:40
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
LESLIE Now, I try to interfere before things have gotten. (crosstalk) 

00:18:45
JON CARLSON All right. 

00:18:45
LESLIE This has just taken a toll, this actually has taken a toll on the kids. 

00:18:45
JON CARLSON  Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
LESLIE So, I don't, I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
JON CARLSON It sounds like it has taken a toll on you guys, too. 

00:18:55
LESLIE No, I did this very much so. 

00:18:55
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:18:55
LESLIE And we've had the same argument about his temper for probably seven years. 

00:19:00
JON CARLSON Is, is the biggest part of the problem for you ah, what the kids do or is, you know, the biggest part of the problem, Leslie, is reaction to what happens? I mean, you see I think I could... (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
SCOTT I see. (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
JON CARLSON ...help you handle the kids a little differently. I think it's worth a try. 

00:19:20
SCOTT Well, a lot of it is, a lot of it, ah, a lot of it is, say, a discipline thing. They've not, I don't think they've really had, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON Yeah? 

00:19:30
SCOTT ...and it's not her fault, it's not my fault. So, they've never, I, I, I was pretty well, harshly disciplined. 

00:19:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:19:40
SCOTT And, ah, I'm not necessarily the one that go out and wanna beat my kids. But when they don't do as they're told. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:19:50
SCOTT There's something gonna happen. 

00:19:50
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:19:50
SCOTT  It's like, "Straighten up your room." They don't straighten up their room. All right, fine. I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna make you, I'm gonna show where it's at. 

00:20:00
DR. JON CARLSON Uh-huh. And, and how would you do that if the kids didn't straighten their room up, and what would. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
SCOTT She'd do it herself. 

00:20:05
LESLIE If they didn't straighten their room, they get grounded. 

00:20:05
JON CARLSON  Uh-huh. So somewhere. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
SCOTT But she'd restraighten up the room. 

00:20:10
JON CARLSON Okay. So. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
LESLIE Oh, I'd go up there and. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
JON CARLSON They just. (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
LESLIE The older ones, no. My 6-year-old, yes, I will help him. 

00:20:15
JON CARLSON So it sounds like you don't approve of his ways and... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
LESLIE Right. 

00:20:20
JON CARLSON ...he doesn't approve of your ways. 

00:20:20
LESLIE Right. 

00:20:20
SCOTT What you just do over this past weekend? 

00:20:20
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
SCOTT You went through and you cleaned up their room because they couldn't clean up their stuff when you wanted. 

00:20:25
LESLIE That's dusting and stuff. I'm not gonna, I, I prefer to do that myself as far as doing the entire housework as overall... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON So. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
LESLIE ...but they can straighten their own room. 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON So do you think it would help if you guys had some agreed way of handling the kids? It's that you mean respected that it's, you know, it's Scott's problem and he will handle it, I'll stay out of it. As long as he handles it this way, or... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
JON CARLSON ...you know, it's Leslie's problem, you know, I'll stay out of it as long as she handles it this way. Have you ever had a class in parenting, have you ever? 

00:21:00
LESLIE Uh-uh. 

00:21:00
SCOTT No. 

00:21:00
JON CARLSON  No? Oh. 

00:21:05
SCOTT We kind of jumped right into this. And here we are. 

00:21:05
JON CARLSON Okay. Yeah, I kinda like the rest of us. 

00:21:10
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
JON CARLSON It's there's, there's not a lot of pre-requisites for this other than physical. 

00:21:10
LESLIE  Right, right. 

00:21:15
JON CARLSON So, and, and then it sounds like you're really good at being firm and you're really good at being kind. That's what it sounds like to me if I got you're, you're kinda like good cop, bad cop, sort of the deal going on here. There's a system that works really simple. And it's, it's deceptively simple, but I'm wondering when you said you ground them, you know, what would happen if, if let's say, the kids came in and you were talking? If you just said this very simple thing that's called 1, 2, 3, magic. Have you ever done this? 

00:21:50
LESLIE You know what? Yeah, we had. 

00:21:50
SCOTT Yeah, we certainly. (crosstalk) 

00:21:50
LESLIE We learned that through the school. 

00:21:55
SCOTT Yeah, and they never. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
JON CARLSON And, and how do they work? 

00:21:55
SCOTT We never get follow up with all that much. 

00:21:55
LESLIE It, it worked while we stuck to it. 

00:22:00
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:22:00
LESLIE It, I mean, every now and then I catch myself using it, but we were getting to a point where my 6-year-old, if you told him that's 1, he would tell you, that's 2. So, I mean that it was... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:22:10
LESLIE ...he was starting to rebel, I can say, a little bit. (crosstalk). 

00:22:15
JON CARLSON And, and then when he says that, then you say, 3, go to your room, take 6? 

00:22:15
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:22:15
JON CARLSON  So you guys, when you learned that at the school, that was okay. I mean, you guys thought that that was a good idea? 

00:22:25
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
JON CARLSON And then you, while you did it, it worked, as long as you did it? (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
LESLIE You know, I, I think it worked. I think it worked. It seemed to go over a lot easier with the older ones because once they learned it the first time, you know. 

00:22:40
JON CARLSON So that's impressive. When I asked you before if you had a solution for this and you guys said you didn't, but it sounds like this was a solution as long as you did it. 

00:22:50
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:22:50
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:22:50
SCOTT Yeah. I guess made us some stick to it. 

00:22:50
LESLIE  But it's remembering to do it when you're in... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
JON CARLSON Well... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
LESLIE ...that heated. 

00:22:55
JON CARLSON ...well, that, that, that, that's important. But see, part of this is staying out of each other's roles in other words, I respect you enough to raise the kids as the way we agreed to, I respect you enough. And then if they don't, you know, if she cleans their room or picks up their stuff or if she should happen to yell, then later on, you bring it back and would say, " Can we talk about what happened?" I, I don't know if that works for you, guys. See, one of the things that I find happens, it sounds like what's going on with you, guys, is that you get into these situations and very quickly, they escalate. And I've learned that once your heart rate get above 96 beats a minute, you know what happens? All bets are off, yeah. What happened, it's, it's for you, it's fight or fright. And, and for you, it's getting defensive, you know. If, if we just put up our armaments and it's all over. So somehow we've got to get some way to teach you guys this, to soothe things a little bit, to keep things down a little bit. And if you had an agreed-upon strategy to use, that might really be helpful. And you know this one too, if you got the (inaudible ), something that you have. (crosstalk) 

00:24:13
LESLIE We saw a videotape. (crosstalk) 

00:24:13
SCOTT (inaudible ) there was a, there was a set of two videotapes... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:24:15
SCOTT ...that we went to see with a counselor or somebody at the school. 

00:24:20
JON CARLSON Okay. But you, you know how to do it? You're using it? (crosstalk). 

00:24:20
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:24:20
SCOTT Yeah. One is we get the warning, two. (crosstalk) 

00:24:25
JON CARLSON Five seconds later is two. 

00:24:25
SCOTT Uh-huh. And they keep it up. It's two and then. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
JON CARLSON And five seconds later, it's three. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
LESLIE It's three. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
SCOTT Three. 

00:24:30
JON CARLSON And what it does is it, it stops you from talking. It stops you from yelling. 

00:24:35
SCOTT Get to their level. 

00:24:35
JON CARLSON Yeah, escalating, it stops you from, you know, moralizing, and it just goes, one, two, three, go to your room, take 6, take 10? 

00:24:45
SCOTT  And what do you do when they go stomping up the stairs, and then bam, they slam their door? 

00:24:50
JON CARLSON Just let it, you, you can let it go or you can say five more minutes. And then you set a timer. And then you stay there and I think if you can work with that which is sort of a compromise between what the two of you do, I think that's why it sounds like it was a pretty good idea because something would be done and that's what you wanna see happen 'cause you don't want the kids getting their way with stuff. And it will be done kindly, which is your issue and because you were more, it sounds like the relationships are really important to you. You're kinda like a, a lot of men and women, I mean, guys are more of the action, they do (inaudible ). Women are more concerned about the relationship and, you know, what goes on inside of the family. What the rules, more with the relationships? 

00:25:40
SCOTT Now, I've always kind of, I, I don't know. I guess I'm supposed to be the one that does to this appointment. It's, it is, and it's never been that way. 

00:25:50
LESLIE I totally disagree. 

00:25:50
JON CARLSON Did you happen to see her having you said this? 

00:25:50
SCOTT  Maybe I shouldn't, that's all I can know. 

00:25:55
JON CARLSON So in the family that you grew up in... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
SCOTT  Oh. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
JON CARLSON ...your father was a disciplinarian? 

00:26:00
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:26:00
JON CARLSON And in the family that you grew up in? 

00:26:00
LESLIE  It was both. 

00:26:05
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. You know, I, I think that's the way most of my families, I don't know, there's, there's really respect for husbands and wives, both do that. 

00:26:15
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
JON CARLSON Because what happens is that if you do the disciplining, you're not gonna be liked. You're gonna be coming in the situations you don't really understand, and they expected to be a referee or a judge. 

00:26:30
SCOTT Well, I've always start off, you know, if she's having a hard time with them...(crosstalk) 

00:26:35
JON CARLSON And? 

00:26:35
SCOTT ...and I will poke at, I will 

00:26:35
poke in and say, "All right, fine. Now, this is the way it's gonna happen." 

00:26:40
JON CARLSON Okay. Let's check this out. Do you appreciate it when he does that? 

00:26:45
LESLIE No. Not that I was asked... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:26:45
LESLIE ...about what I think. 

00:26:45
JON CARLSON So what would happen if that was the rule? Assume you're not needed, that she really wants to learn how to do this? She wants to learn how to be firm like you and to handle these situations, but she needs practice and she won't get practice if you keep sticking your. 

00:27:00
SCOTT Nose in. 

00:27:00
JON CARLSON  No, just the thought. 

00:27:05
SCOTT That's fine. Like we can do a jack(ph). 

00:27:10
JON CARLSON We call it respect. I mean, it's like, you know, the thing that I respect, you know, that, that she can handle this and for you, it's gonna be respect too. And then I find it might be helpful for you, you may have to leave if he starts doing it with the kids. 

00:27:25
LESLIE  Okay. So what happens when it gets to the point of... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
SCOTT You mean, (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
LESLIE ...stepping over the. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
SCOTT ...leave with the kids? 

00:27:35
JON CARLSON No, no, no, no. I'm glad you clarified that. No, what I'm suggesting is that like if you go one and you go two, rather than say anything... (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
LESLIE Oh. (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
JON CARLSON ...she needs to, you know, either keep quiet or she needs to respect you, that you will handle it. 

00:27:50
LESLIE Right. Well, that's fine as long as he stuck to that, but when he start, when he gets, often he gets angry with the name calling and physically grabbing the children. (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
JON CARLSON But we, but we, we have agreed that that's unacceptable. 

00:28:00
LESLIE  Okay. 

00:28:05
JON CARLSON He said that he doesn't wanna do that anymore. 

00:28:05
LESLIE Okay. 

00:28:05
JON CARLSON And, and, and if you can agree not to comment on him anymore, I think we'd get a, you know, one place to start with this. 

00:28:10
LESLIE Uh hmm. I can do it if he was doing the one, two, three, I could. 

00:28:15
JON CARLSON Now, what can we do to help you? One of the things I know with the questionnaire that I had is that you both kind of report some depression, did you know that? I mean, and I don't know, is, is that something that's recent just because you're separated? 

00:28:25
SCOTT  No, just... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
JON CARLSON I mean, extra hold at sleeping, snuggle with? (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
SCOTT ...this, this, this is something I've been trying to treat for a while. 

00:28:35
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:28:35
SCOTT And I don't know, maybe it was sometimes we went about things in the wrong way. 

00:28:40
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
SCOTT You know, I get depressed. I don't like where we're staying, sell the house, buy a new house. 

00:28:45
JON CARLSON So that's your treatment for depression? It's buying you a house? (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
SCOTT I don't know. I don't actually know. That was actually when it was, but it seems like it, it's, when I get real bad there for a while, you know, at, at the old house so (inaudible ). 

00:29:03
JON CARLSON So, you just get in this situation? 

00:29:05
SCOTT Finalized. Yeah. Well. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
JON CARLSON A new challenge 

00:29:05
SCOTT Yeah. We start fresh. All, all new people around and. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
LESLIE It didn't work. 

00:29:10
SCOTT It didn't work, no. It worked for about a year. 

00:29:10
JON CARLSON  And this is, you guys, when you were married, you did this, right? 

00:29:15
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:29:15
SCOTT Uh-huh. And then it's, you know, like I said it's, it's something that I've been trying to treat... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
JON CARLSON Other than. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
SCOTT ...and I'm, I've gone through more extensive steps now. 

00:29:30
JON CARLSON Now, what else did you try? You know, what else have you done besides buying and selling your house? 

00:29:30
SCOTT Well, I. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
LESLIE Medication. 

00:29:30
SCOTT I've been, I've been going to the doctor now. I went to a, a new doctor. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
LESLIE He's been on medication. 

00:29:35
JON CARLSON Oh. 

00:29:35
SCOTT I was on, I was on Prozac that didn't do nothing. 

00:29:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:29:40
SCOTT I went to Paxil and BuSpar and... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:29:40
SCOTT ...and the Paxil, I didn't like what it did to me. Get, when you get started on it, I didn't like what it does to me, going off of it and I just stopped. I was sick for about two weeks trying to get over the withdrawal from it. 

00:29:55
JON CARLSON Did you notice any change when he was on the medication? 

00:30:00
LESLIE Uhm, the Prozac was bad. 

00:30:00
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:30:00
LESLIE He was just. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
JON CARLSON He was worse on that? 

00:30:05
LESLIE He was worse but, uhm, the first time he was on BuSpar, I noticed. (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
SCOTT Well, that's the one that's doing it. 

00:30:10
LESLIE That, uhm, whichever one was but the first time he was on it, there was some kind of a change. He seemed a little bit more mellow. But the last time he was on it, there, he really, it wasn't, it's almost like he got immune to it. 

00:30:20
JON CARLSON  So there was some hope by looking at maybe some medication and that's like treating the physical part of the problem. There's a couple of other things that had been known to be really helpful and, and I don't know how will this fit in your life. Do you exercise? 

00:30:40
SCOTT  Not as far as off the job, no. 

00:30:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:30:45
SCOTT I do quite of it. 

00:30:45
JON CARLSON Well, you move (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

00:30:48
SCOTT What I do is kind of physical. 

00:30:48
JON CARLSON  That's one thing that they say work is not riding on a bike, running, walking vigorously, getting your heart rate up and keeping it up for like 40 minutes. If you could do that four times a week. Again, I don't know your schedules. I know you work hard and you're gonna say you know. 

00:31:05
SCOTT Oh, I could probably go out and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
JON CARLSON  The kids do it?(crosstalk) 

00:31:10
SCOTT ...ride a bike. I could ride a bike. 

00:31:10
JON CARLSON Kids will probably go with you. 

00:31:10
SCOTT I'm going to ride my bike and be racing and get my heart up like that, they ain't staying with me. 

00:31:15
JON CARLSON Okay. So that's a possibility and in the winter, I suppose it could be a stationary bike or something. 

00:31:20
LESLIE/SCOTT  Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
JON CARLSON And how about in, in, you had some depressive symptoms too? 

00:31:30
LESLIE Uh hmm. And mine's only about like within six months to a year. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
SCOTT No, she's lying with that. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
LESLIE But it's because, no, it hasn't. 

00:31:35
JON CARLSON So you think it's longer? 

00:31:35
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
LESLIE It's, it is because of finally being fed up with the situation... (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
JON CARLSON All right. 

00:31:45
LESLIE ...but I've never been on medication for it or anything. 

00:31:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. And do you have anything that works, that's, that's helpful for you? 

00:31:50
LESLIE So far, uhm, when he left. 

00:31:55
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:31:55
SCOTT Yeah, get out. 

00:31:55
JON CARLSON  And has that helped? 

00:32:00
LESLIE I actually have felt a little. (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
JON CARLSON Maybe you slept better? 

00:32:00
LESLIE I have slept better. 

00:32:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:32:05
LESLIE I feel a little bit more relaxed and able to function. 

00:32:05
JON CARLSON  So maybe a change in the, in the situation helps. So if you can change the situation, so you feel safer maybe that will help the depression. A second thing that really works, and I don't know you well enough about this either but they've done some studies with people who've been really angry people. Actually prisoners. 

00:32:30
SCOTT Oh, (inaudible ). 

00:32:35
JON CARLSON I mean, they've been so angry that they've ended up in prison. And they had to meditate. He's, looking at his eyes, he's rolling his eyes. And they found that people who meditated for 30 minutes a day did better than the group that went to therapy and better than the group that took the medicine. 

00:32:55
SCOTT Well, maybe I'd better meditate, take therapy, and the medicine. 

00:32:55
JON CARLSON  You could. Well, that don't leave any, you know. 

00:33:00
SCOTT I'm gonna hit all the vases. I'd gotta get this stuff straighten out. 

00:33:05
JON CARLSON And meditation is, is basically where you just focus on relaxing and breathing and there's all different kinds that, you know, you can follow but it might be worth either talking to somebody or giving some kind of a meditation tape for something to work on. 

00:33:20
SCOTT  Well, I've gotten to this new doctor, I'm on a different medication. 

00:33:25
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:25
SCOTT  And I've started with a therapist. 

00:33:30
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:30
SCOTT  Because I went to talk to the doctor and... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
JON CARLSON Uh-huh. 

00:33:35
SCOTT ...he says I've got some underlying deep-seated anger problems. And I, I tried, I started going to a... (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:33:45
SCOTT ...group of, uh, called rageaholics. 

00:33:45
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
SCOTT  And the another problem I have is OCD. 

00:33:50
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
SCOTT  And I had a situation where somebody approached me that I just thought I was a little less than desirable. 

00:34:05
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
SCOTT And it made my skin crawl and I quit. 

00:34:10
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:34:10
SCOTT I was trying, I was trying to get everything under control. 

00:34:15
JON CARLSON  So that was something that worked until this event and... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:34:20
JON CARLSON ...you're at least you're making some progress at. Ah, you may have this underlying issues and I think it's, you know, I think it's probably a good thing that you see a therapist and maybe talk this thoroughly. You also have to get those issues out. You still got to learn some new ways to be. You know and that's why I think if you could start some kind of an exercise program, maybe even taking some time to meditate daily, I think that's gonna reduce this significantly to you. So that you're gonna have more of a pause before you respond. So I think what happens is you just, something happens and there's like a major reaction for him. 

00:35:05
LESLIE Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
JON CARLSON And he needs to condition himself so that he can ah, stop where he wants to stop and then not responding. You know, you might even benefit from it too because it sounds like you've got a lot of the things and greetings that couples have when relationships go south. There are things like criticism ah, which, you know, that sounds like that's what was called contempt. You look at somebody in a negative way, sounds like that's there. Then you're each defending. You're defensive. You defend your right to do what you're doing even though that, you know, you defend your attitude and you defend your anger. And then there's this stonewall, you put up sometimes where you just won't talk. You remove yourself from one another. And those are the four things that really make a relationship go bad. And if you can learn how to pause, you can have some choices a little bit. So you can choose rather than defending. Maybe you can take a deep breath and you could say, "So if I understand you right, you think we need to have the kids leave us alone so we can talk?" And he'll say, "That's exactly right." And you say, "I agree with you. How should we handle it?" I think there's some real cooperation that you guys show at times when you keep your heart rates down. 

00:36:30
SCOTT  Yeah. Mine's so fast to go up though. 

00:36:35
JON CARLSON Well, that's why I think you need some of this other training. You know, I don't think it's just gonna happen by talking. I think you really gonna have to do some work. You're gonna have to do some training. 

00:36:50
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
JON CARLSON Now, one thing I wondered, what do you guys do for fun? I couldn't tell that on the phone. 

00:36:55
SCOTT  Fight. 

00:37:00
JON CARLSON Okay. Fight. Okay. You guys must have a lot of fun. 

00:37:05
SCOTT Yeah, we've been having all the time the last couple of weeks. 

00:37:05
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:37:05
LESLIE  You know, I used to because I'm a talker, believe it or not, but I am a talker and, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
JON CARLSON  I believe you.(crosstalk) 

00:37:15
LESLIE ...I used to enjoy just sitting and talking with him as long as he stayed awake and listened. But, uhm, you know, just spending time with one another used to be fun but we just don't do things every now and then. Over the years, it's becoming less and less but. 

00:37:30
JON CARLSON Is there a reason why that is? Just you haven't been getting along? Is that the. (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
LESLIE No, that's only part of it. Finances, you know, stuff like that. 

00:37:35
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
LESLIE I was busy working and trying to take care of the household. 

00:37:40
SCOTT You've got bills to pay and work to do and, you know, it can't always work in the fun. 

00:37:50
JON CARLSON Well, you know they say that relationships need to increase the amount of positive exchanges that go on between us in a relationship. And you probably had a lot of them when you were dating because you took the time to be with one another and to do some things with one another. I'm wondering if you could start dating again. 

00:38:10
SCOTT  Oh... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
JON CARLSON And. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
SCOTT ...and lead up to this? 

00:38:15
JON CARLSON And, and what you do on a date is you agree, raise, there'll be no issues would be raised. That when you go out, the purpose is to just enjoy one another. So if somebody starts to say something, the other one goes time out. This isn't the time for it. And you take turns picking the dating. I mean, so this week might be your date. If you wanna go every week or every other week, in two weeks would be your date. And if you wanna take her to a baseball game, she may wanna take you to the ballet. You wanna go for a walk, she may wanna go to a movie. But whatever the person says, you know, we're gonna go bring your hiking boots. We're gonna go out for a trek through nature. That's our date. And you say, "Cool." You just agree with it. And if he says, "I wanna do something;" you say, "Fine." To get some, get some fresh air in your relationship. I mean, could you imagine yourself doing that? I mean take. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
SCOTT That would be cool. 

00:39:15
JON CARLSON I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
SCOTT Enjoying being around her would be a whole lot more fun and I like it. 

00:39:20
JON CARLSON With those rules? 

00:39:20
SCOTT Oh, yeah. 

00:39:20
JON CARLSON And I think somewhere on the line, you guys have gotta put some boundaries on a few of these things and, and really learn some different ways to be with one another. So we talked about dating, we talked about maybe exercising. You're already doing the other stuffs, the medication. We have talked about meditation. We talked about discipline. A lot of stuff that came out with you. Is this what you were hoping for? Is this the kind of things that might be helpful for you, some of these tools? 

00:39:55
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:39:55
LESLIE I would think so. 

00:39:55
SCOTT  I hope so. 

00:40:00
JON CARLSON Other questions that you might have? Are there some other things that you'd hope to we might touch on today that we didn't get a chance to? 

00:40:05
LESLIE  I don't think I have any. 

00:40:10
JON CARLSON Okay, to you? Okay. 

00:40:15
SCOTT I'm trying to think. How do you know if what I'm thinking about would even pertain? What about putting some kind of boundaries on what the kids are to do and some... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
SCOTT  some ah, like boundaries, I'm saying like in chores. You got to do your chores. You got to do this. You got to do that before you can do this. You're not sleeping on the floor in the living room, watching TV all, all week. Make your beds and stuff like that before you go out. You know? That's, that's a big thing on me. 

00:40:50
JON CARLSON Okay. Why don't we stop for a second. So, what do you think of those ideas? 

00:40:55
LESLIE Unless I have no problem with them making their beds or they really don't have chores right now as assigned, you know, but, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
JON CARLSON So you're not opposed to a rule about more organization... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
LESLIE Uh-huh. 

00:41:05
JON CARLSON ...in the house? 

00:41:05
JON CARLSON It's, it's just you're kind of wary about what the consequences are if somebody doesn't use them and. 

00:41:10
LESLIE  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:41:15
LESLIE Yeah, pretty much. 

00:41:15
SCOTT Yeah, she figures I'm gonna puff up... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
JON CARLSON So... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
SCOTT ...and do something silly. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
JON CARLSON ...so if there could be some gentler ways maybe to, to handle that, it might be worthwhile and, and this is probably some material for a whole other, you know, whole other time but kind of in a nutshell, you could probably have a family meeting with the kids. Breakdown some jobs that needed to be done and really divide them up. And you could set up consequences like, you know, you need to do your work before you can play. 

00:41:45
SCOTT  Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
JON CARLSON You need to do your work before you watch TV. But it might even be things that we found real help with our kids is that every body got an allowance. Okay? Just, they just got it because they're a member of the family. Then they have jobs to do. And if jobs weren't done, anybody else could do them and then charge whatever they wanted. So like you know. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
SCOTT  Chris must have been rich. 

00:42:15
JON CARLSON And so the trash wasn't, you know, taken out and it was supposed to be taken out by 5 o'clock, somebody else could just go take the trash out, write down trash out 50 cents and just put it into a little jar and end of the week you give the allowance out and then you check to see what there is. In that way mom could go ahead and pick up their toys if she wanted to but, and bill them for it. 

00:42:35
SCOTT Yeah. 

00:42:35
JON CARLSON And so there's, this really becomes a consequence and yet there's not a lot of yelling. 

00:42:40
SCOTT Uh hmm. But what frustrates me so much is she can spend all weekend cleaning the house. Now, you know, going through and clean the drawers and clean the closets and all of that is fine. That's great. She does a beautiful job in the house when she does it that way. 

00:43:00
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:00
SCOTT  But every week, it don't have to be done that way. You know, go ahead, you dust, you vacuum, straighten up, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
JON CARLSON Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
SCOTT ...make the bed and. (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
JON CARLSON I thought you had OCD. 

00:43:10
SCOTT I do. 

00:43:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:43:10
SCOTT  But you see. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
LESLIE I think it was. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
JON CARLSON It sounds like that's what you're accusing her of. 

00:43:20
SCOTT It's, it's continuous because they keep messing it up. 

00:43:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:43:25
SCOTT All right. Now, Christopher has got Legos, Duke(ph) connects, and what's the other one he's got? He's got another kind of toy. 

00:43:30
JON CARLSON  Okay. 

00:43:35
SCOTT All right, fine. He's playing with all of them. Room's a wreck. I'll straighten them up to bed and he's playing it all together, I will put it on the same box. I guess I'm going to put back together. But she wants to go, she wants to take the Lego off of them, he connects, put that one over here, that one over there. There's no need. He's gonna mess it up again. Put it away. 

00:43:55
JON CARLSON But that's her choice. Now that. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
SCOTT Well, she, but it... (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
JON CARLSON But you're, your're concerned. (crosstalk) 

00:43:55
SCOTT  irritates her. She gets irritated that she has to do this all of the time. Why, why is your bedroom is gotta be such a mess? You know, you're not gonna put that there, you're not going to put. (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
JON CARLSON Okay. But how does that become your problem? 

00:44:10
SCOTT  We don't have ah, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
JON CARLSON  Ah, don't have time (inaudible ). (crosstalk)? 

00:44:22
SCOTT Yeah, we don't have time. 

00:44:22
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:44:22
SCOTT Because she's, she's always got to be cleaning up. Now, I don't think she will admit to you, I don't have a problem helping her. 

00:44:25
JON CARLSON  And I have a hunch though, let's just put that on advance right now. And I think you're making a good suggestion. But my guess is that maybe sometimes people do things when relationships are going bad so they can avoid one another. So as long as I'm busy picking things up then I don't have to be with one another. Just, just hold that as a possibility and then as you guys start to do some of these other more positive things, let's just see if that doesn't take care of itself. Just a hunch. That's the hunch I have. 

00:44:55
SCOTT Good enough. 

00:44:55
JON CARLSON  I mean, I (inaudible ). I really appreciate you coming and, and sharing yourself. And it sounds like we're working on using some of these tools that you really didn't have ah... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
SCOTT (inaudible ) 

00:45:11
JON CARLSON ...you know, your disposal if you could, really work at using them, life could really be a lot different. Good luck. And I thank both of you. (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
LESLIE Thank you. 

00:45:20
JON CARLSON  Thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
SCOTT Thank you. 

00:45:25
