LESLIE KORN Welcome to Beyond Fish Oil. I'm Dr. Leslie Korn and thank you for joining me today. We're going to be exploring the role of mental health nutrition in stabilizing mood and wellbeing. 

00:00:15

00:00:20
LESLIE KORN I'd like to begin just by sharing my conflict, my no conflict of interest statement. I'm going to be sharing with you a number of products today, a number of things that I have made in the kitchen yesterday along with products that have been donated for this purpose today that I use either personally and always with my clients, and I receive no money for that purpose. I just find that they are very good quality products and I want to share that with you. I'd like to begin also with some information on contacts and a little bit about my background. I've given you some of my websites and my email incase after this you have questions or you desire to do a consultation with a particular client. My own work currently is focusing clinically on helping people get off of pharmaceuticals or keep them from getting on pharmaceuticals. I see a number of individuals ranging from children with ADD, ADHD diagnosis through people with chronic depression, complex trauma with a mix of somatic and physical psychosomatic illness. Umm… And so many people find that pharmaceuticals aren't working for them, maybe they have got philosophical or religious prohibitions against using them. Maybe the side-effects are too difficult to tolerate. Whatever the reason may be, when we're working with chemistry, we're working with biology and psychobiology, that is our aim in improving food nutrients that support the brain and body mind function. My own work in nutritional therapy began over 30 years ago. My background scenario, Vedic medicine and Chinese medicine. I've also trained in western nutritional therapies and worked in the jungle of Mexico. I've worked in the jungle of Boston. I've umm… I, I currently do a lot of work with tribal communities around food revitalization with a focus on traditional foods. Lot of my works in cultural competency, and as clinicians drawing on the role of medicines and foods as they relate to culture with our culturally diverse clients. Okay. So let's get started. One final resource is Rhythms of Recovery, my book. Rhythms of Recovery: Trauma, Nature, and the Body. And much of what we will talk about today is written in this book. I've also got additional chapters on botanical medicines. And, and a whole integrative medicine approach to treatment of traumatic stress and it's aciculae. I'll be in Portland, in Eugene next week and then in California. I've given you the resources there. As I say this seminar today is 2 hours out a 7 hours seminar that encompasses complementary an alternative medicine for the treatment of mental health disorders. Alan Gaby who is a physician nutritional therapist has a wonderful saying, "From Big Mac to Zantac to Prozac," suggesting that we begin with poor quality foods the Big Mac and we get indigestion or GERD acid reflux and we take acid suppressants or digestive aids and then we end up being depressed anyway and we go to our antidepressants. All a result of the standard American diet that makes us sad.

00:04:20
LESLIE KORN So what are our basic mental health nutritional principles? Poor digestion is always involved in poor mental health. I suggest that if you take a physical history along with the emotional affective psychohistory, psychosocial history, whatever the assessment is that you are using, if you integrate a physical history, you will be able to chart the history of poor digestion and digestive problems, often beginning in childhood. The stomach aches, the gas, the taking medication, uh, acid reflux, poor bowel movements, Laxative use, that's not to mention of course some of the eating disorders, bulimia, night eating disorder, umm… binge eating disorder, anorexia that often begin in youth. So I ask you to integrate a psychosocial assessment that includes physical history and use of medications, not just the psychotropics. We are seeing a lot of diabetes in our clinical practice today often co-associating with depression. 

00:05:45

00:05:50
LESLIE KORN By incorporating nutritional changes and working with our clients in a self-care model, we can get incredible improvement in their mental health. It's really the missing piece in our work. And as I say we may begin with a PsychoEd model of educating and supporting and coaching towards self-care, and of course, we want to role model this ourselves. And we may then choose to walk the next steps with a naturopathic physician and integrative medicine physician, a dietician or nutritional therapist. In psychoeducation and mindful eating, we incorporate our work as mental health clinicians. We explore the meaning of food in an individual's life, including the history of food, both past and present. What was eating like in the nuclear family? Did people grow up in a foster family or foster home? Was there stress at dinner time? Was lunch or breakfast prepared? What is the history around food and the meaning of food and nourishment through self-care in our clients' lives? I want to understand food gathering and preparation currently. Who does it in the family? Am I working with a single person? Am I working with someone who is overwhelmed with responsibilities and doesn't have time to prepare food? One of the things that we're going to do today and I'd like to demonstrate is just what I spent two hours doing yesterday to prepare food for the week, because food cost and time spent are some of the key factors in individuals' lives. People may have traumatic or phobic experiences about being in the kitchen, having eaten food, I've worked with clients who have had disasters in the kitchen that have hurt them, so there are lots of reasons why people do and don't cook and prepare food. And the other thing I'll explore overtime with the client is really the sensitivities of their taste buds. Are they addicted to high intensity foods just like we can become addicted to stress. When we do over salting, when we have lots of sugar, when we've got all of these powerful drug like actions in foods. It keeps our clients from really being able to taste the true quality of food. And this will lead to their saying, I don't like that food or I don't, I don't feel anything or, or experiencing any benefits from that food. So we can go very deeply into this exploration with clients overtime and this is the intersection of our work in mental health that most nutritional therapists do not have. So we'll make a good collaborating partner if we chose to work with another clinician. The beginning from mindful eating is taking our time to prepare food and to eat it. And just the simple act of taking a fork, putting food on the fork, putting it in the mouth and chewing. A hundred times per mouthful. How many of us actually do that? It comes out of the old macrobiotic theory that we must masticate our food until it becomes liquid. It's not only so that we digest food better because we do begin to digest our carbs in our mouths and salivate them with amylase. But it's a process of being mindful moment to moment of what we're doing when we are nourishing ourselves. It's the old adage of being relaxed when we eat as well. Not only because it's good practice, but because it's in the parasympathetic mode, the relaxation mode that our digestion proceeds, that all the juices are flowing to digest the food that we're eating. Now for those of our clients who have a hard time practicing mindfulness, there's a new product about to come on to the market called "The Happy Fork" and this is a wonderful new technological innovation of really a bowl feedback mechanism that signals you if you are shoveling food too quickly into your mouth. So look up The Happy Fork if you think you or a client will benefit from it. One of the first things I do with the client is do a food diary and then an evaluation. And you should have this handout in your packet and I ask you to open this up now or to look at it if you've already printed it out. I'd like to go over it with you. The food diary in the clinician checklist that accompanies it is designed to give you a basic PsychoEd self-care approach to working with a client around his or her self-care behaviors. And it also is a process of raising consciousness and raising awareness. There's so much in our society that works against our integrative approach to making the connection that the food choices affect our mood and wellbeing. Advertising is a general form of social disassociation, let alone our clients who are already disassociated due to chronic stress or complex trauma in their lives. So by and large people aren't often connected to the relationship between their behaviors and then how it makes them feel. And so the very basic aspect of this food dairy is to begin to ask those questions. And then we hunker down into the details and I help you analyze that very basically in the clinician checklist. So if you look, what we've asked a client to do is keep a dairy of three days, of what they eat, the time that they eat it including beverages and to track their energy levels, to track their mood and also to track their digestive response. Many people take for granted that bloating or gas is normal, generally it's not. It might be normal if people eat a lot of beans because as protein and carbohydrates digest together, they can cause a little flatulence. But by and large gas is a byproduct of fermentation, which is a byproduct of undigested fermented food. If you think about putting a pot of food on the stove and then letting it sit there for three days without putting a fire under it to cook it, you get an idea of what happens in our belly if we don't digest our food. So I want to know all of this information over a three-day period. And I encourage you to practice this with yourselves first. After all, most of what we do here is something that will benefit us not just for mood, but for optimal health and for health or illness prevention. If you then look to the clinician checklist, I'd like to walk through that with you. The left hand column allows you to ask questions. So when I'm looking at the food diary and it's just like any assessment, the more we do it, the more we put together the pieces of the puzzle and we start to see some meaningful pieces stand out for us. The left hand column allows us to ask questions of our clients and look at the food diary together when they have brought it in. I can note some of the answers down. And then on the right hand column I've got general goals and recommendations that can help balance out the findings. So I want to know how much time has passed between when the client awakens and when they eat breakfast. One of the core foundational ideas I'll share with you today is maintaining blood glucose at an even level. And when we wake up in the morning we've often been fasting for four, five, six, seven, nine hours. The body needs a little something, a little glucose which is the major fuel for the brain, but not refined glucose, not sugar and cheerios, but a good source of glucose along with protein and fat. So if a client tells me they wake up and they go to work and they don't eat until 10 or 11, I want to understand how that may be affecting their energy. Maybe they tell me at 10 or 11 they start to get irritable or tired or even meltdown and start getting irritated with coworkers. They may not put together the idea that they are going off with maybe just a cup of coffee which is like putting a hammer to the adrenal glands and say, get going, we're going, but I'm not gonna give you any fuel, I'm just gonna bang on you, meaning, banging on the adrenals and the body to move forward. 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:20
LESLIE KORN So the other question is I'm looking through the whole food diary for the day. Is how much water or broth is someone drinking? The general rule of thumb is that we do well with 25% to 50% of our body weight in ounces. So if you are working with someone who's 150 pounds, they will do well with 60 to 75 ounces of water a day. 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
LESLIE KORN Dehydration is a major cause of fatigue and headaches and so this can become a cyclical problem if people get headaches because they are dehydrated and then they take painkillers and painkillers can tear up the gut. They affect the ability of the gut to create a neurotransmitters and it becomes a vicious cycle, same with fatigue. If I'm fatigued because I'm not drinking enough water, I may use dietary stimulants like coffee or tea or chocolate to increase my energy. When really if I increased my water intake, I might take care of some of these problems. So that's another very basic foundational approach is, how much water are you drinking? 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
LESLIE KORN How often is the client eating is a core question we want to explore, particularly with functional hyperglycemia in which blood sugar rises and falls throughout the day. Our mood rises with an increase in glucose and it drops with a decrease in glucose. And this is a pattern that I'm asking you to look for. As you look at the food diary and you look at the times of day people eat. How many hours there are between those meals or those snacks? And then when does food, when does mood drop? And mood will drop not only, will someone feel low mood, but they more often when functional hyperglycemia hits they will feel irritated, they might feel angry, they could even feel enraged. They could start shaking. Any number of symptoms people have described feeling like their, their muscles are turning to rubber and they can't stand up. That's when blood sugar has dropped too low. And these individuals have often been living under tremendous stress, their adrenal glands are stressed, they can't stabilize their blood glucose. This is often pre-diabetes. And just by increasing food to every three hours, you can begin to stabilize that blood glucose. So that's a major piece that I want you to keep in mind as you are looking at this food diary and analyzing, "How many hours are there between food and snacks?" How many servings of vegetables is someone eating? I think that's a fairly straight forward question. Vegetables are so important as anti-inflammatories for five… Sources of fiber. So many important roles for the, for vegetables. But far too many people don't prepare them, they don't eat them, people often don't know how to cook. And so I'll show you today some ideas about preparation of vegetables that's simple and will really solve some of this for individuals. Are people eating raw, raw vegetables and raw fruits as well? Most people will do well with a combination of raw and cooked foods. Cooked foods are easier for people to digest. And most people who have been eating only cooked foods might say to you, oh, I can't digest raw or I, I get gas when I eat raw food. That's a sign of not having utilized the digestive juices and muscular retroperistalsis for eating raw. So with these individuals who do not eat anything raw, I might begin by introducing them to a fruit or a vegetable that they can eat cooked and then semi-cooked. A baked apple is an example. If someone is not eating apples, one of the best mood stabilizing foods there is. People can eat one to two apples a day along with some almonds to stabilize their mood as a snack. But if they can't digest raw apple, I begin by having them bake the apple and slowly baking it for less time, so their body gets used to raw food. Most people do well with 40%, 40% to 50% raw in their diet, 50% cooked. 

00:21:05

00:21:10
LESLIE KORN Is the client eating enough protein? This is a key component of stabilizing mood. Many of our mood labile clients are addicted to refined carbohydrates. And we find carbohydrates like sugar or refined flours and even a lot of grains on their own will raise blood sugar, but then drop it very soon there after. And as I said mood goes up and then mood comes down. And so what stabilizes or anchors carbohydrates or protein? Now I'm going to suggest to you that one of the most important things is to get our clients off of all refined foods. And they should only ever really been, be eaten as occasional treats, meaning, so that one doesn't become so rigid umm… that if they feel uncomfortable in a social setting, refined food product, you know, once every few weeks is not going to hurt someone who's doing most everything else right. But a diet of refined foods every day is highly addictive and it's highly contributory factor to mood lability depression and inflammatory process. We don't really know what baseline mood is with our clients until they are off of the foods that alter their mood negatively. We don't know about mood lability in our bipolar diagnosis 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:50
LESLIE KORN Until a client is managing mood with proper food. We don't really know how much baseline ADD or ADHD there really is, until we help that child get off of sugar and refined carbohydrates that alter mood. And the best way to do that is to increase or ensure adequate protein intake which serves as an anchor to complex carbohydrates. And I'll talk with you more about this when we look at the foods I prepared for today. Of course healthy fats… We've just come through a 50 year period of fear about fats, fear about eggs, fear about saturated fats we know unequivocally that saturated fat does not contribute to heart disease, it does not contribute to high cholesterol, that actually cholesterol is a healthy important constituent of brain function, that too low cholesterol, too low fat diets are leading to cognitive decline and to mental disorders being out of order. 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
LESLIE KORN So I want to look at the healthy fats in my clients' diet. Their phobias about fat, but also help them make substitutions and that's going to be a key theme today is how do we substitute healthy foods for the unhealthy foods painlessly? And then of course how many servings of starchy carbohydrates? How much sugar including soft drinks? We get soft drinks that include both sugar and caffeine. We know these high energy drinks are gateway drug to alcohol addiction. So I want to understand this in both adolescent clients as well as adult clients so that we can begin to start finding some alternatives. One of the keys to this approach is understanding that we're often self medicating with what we eat. We are self regulating. After all that's the central theme around mood in our work is how do we help our client's self regulate? Because so many illnesses are rooted in overwhelming experiences that disrupt the ability to self regulate. And so food is often used because of its chemical constituents, just like drugs and alcohol to self regulate. We use coffee to increase our energy in our cognitive function umm… and we use carbohydrates rich in tryptophan which converts to serotonin to help us relax. So it's important then to understand coffee works as a drug and to use it as a drug, but not as a beverage. So part of my work in psychoeducation is helping a client to understand why they are choosing the foods they are, they are choosing, when they are choosing them. Helping them understand that it's a process in which they are attempting to regulate affect or any number of other aspects of their being. And to find ways in which it's adaptive or maladaptive and to increase the adaptive behaviors where they can find foods that will still fulfill those needs of the brain, mind, body, without feeling like they are being deprived, but understanding how they can work to their advantage. I want to understand the quality of the food someone is eating as well. And I want to continue to support them to purchase high quality food. And one of my goals for cooking for today was to cook a lot of meals with a high quality food that was low cost. And I'll go over it a little bit later when we have our kitchen session. People will say I don't have time or I don't have money and so I want to support people for getting fresh foods and organic when possible and working within peoples' budgets. And this approach for those of you working in agencies or working in food programs, working with elders, there are a lot of creative and innovative ways to change purchasing habits. And we've got a number of cases throughout the country where large agencies are making changes so that their elders are getting good quality fats, not the trans fats, changing out coconut fat for example for cognitive health, and reducing soy protein isolates that are being often shipped in to tribal reservations, food programs. So a lots of creative ways, not just in our own families, not just for our clients but for whole agency delivery in changing the food system as well as the school food systems. I also want to know if the client is eating enough fiber. Fiber is key to regulating glucose uptake. Fiber slows down the speed of which glucose is taken up by the cells. And this is key to regulating mood. When we eat a donut our energy moves up rapidly and it shoots down and then our energy is low and we eat again something that shoots up our energy and it comes down again and we've got a mood, food up and down all day. Fiber is always found in foods that have natural sugars in them. Fruits for example. So the reason fruits are a good source of sugar is because the fruit comes with the fiber that will slow that uptake of glucose, so it's a little more even, it's not shooting straight up. For example, one of the things we do when we're treating mood lability is ask people to add extra fiber to their diet when they eat. For example, it could be cilium. You may know that as Metamucil, but I, I don't recommend Metamucil, its got food dyes in it and sugar added to it believe it or not. You can get very good basic cilium, but the other thing that I use, I really love this product and there are others on the market, this is a flax, chia seed and coconut. It's a combination of omega 3s and a fiber. So if I'm using fiber with my meals, I'm going to slow the uptake of glucose and regulate my mood. It's why we ask people with diabetes to add a little extra fiber, 20-30 minutes before they eat. So this is a little bit, it's just a very beginning introduction to this food diary and a very basic PsychoEd analysis. At a more advanced level we might look at depleted nutrients. We might look also at, is someone eating a mostly vegetarian diet? And I'll talk a little bit about that. So our basic change principles for nutrition. We want to identify positive changes that are doable for people. Identify substitutions that are doable and identify and eliminate addictive foods one at a time. So some positive changes… Most of my clients will respond very positively if I ask them to purchase a virgin or an extra virgin cold pressed olive oil and butter instead of margarine and canola oil. They will get a lot more medicine from that food, olive oil and butter. Then they will, the negative side and the proinflammatory effects of those other oils. It's a fairly painless substitution to make. It is a little more expensive, but I explain to my clients that it's medicine. And overtime it will help them stay healthier. I want to identify and eliminate the addictive foods one at a time. And I chose those goals with my client is in collaboration. We set out a list of those foods that they feel they are addicted to and we start to make choices about what kinds of exchanges they can make. For example, I love Stevia and if you are not already using Stevia, I like the liquid Stevia. The powdered Stevia tends to be a little bitter, but the liquid Stevia is a hundred times sweeter than sugar. It's made directly from a plant in, from South America. It's actually been shown in clinical trials to lower blood sugar so it's very good for people with high blood sugar, diabetes. And it's a very powerful alternative to sugar. So when I have a client who's eating lots of chocolate and sugary chocolate and let's remember chocolate is good for us, but the sugar isn't. So we get the good chocolate, but then the sugar takes away any of the benefits of those wonderful polyphenols. I teach my client how to make a chocolate smoothie, sweetened with Stevia, just a pure cocoa, a pure chocolate or a hot chocolate and they can add a little cream to that or almond milk and I've given you some of these recipes. So I won't go over the exact recipe now. But in your handouts you have some recipes. And for those of you who are interested, the URL that I gave you for my book, I've made about 100 pages of that book available as free downloads and they have more recipes, protocols, and different kinds of approaches to support client health. So our basic premise is mood follows food. Mood follows blood glucose levels. We balance blood glucose. We balance mood. So I want to know when I'm working with someone whose mood labile if I get a 25% improvement in their mood just because they are eating well, then we know really what is emotional affective work that we're going to work on, but we've taken care of 25%, even 50% improvement as a result of improving mood. Proteins and fats combined with carbohydrates balance and stabilize mood. It's where we're getting only the refined carbohydrates that we destabilize mood. 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:34:45
LESLIE KORN Not only mood but attention follows food. This is why it's so important that our children and even ourselves as we go off to work in the morning that we stabilize our tension and our mood with a combination of protein, carbohydrate and fat. The carbohydrate alone will not last. That's why our kids are melting down two hours later in school. So I want to increase quality protein intake in the morning. I want to eliminate the refined carbohydrates. I always want to eat protein with carbohydrates. You should have a little bit more protein than your carbohydrates in the beginning when you're stabilizing mood. And then always for these individuals a protein rich snack every three hours or so. And this is important for people who have trouble sleeping. With insomnia, where you have a type of insomnia where you go to sleep and you wake up two to three hours later, that often can be helped by eating a little protein and carbohydrate right before bed. With these individuals throughout the day where mood lability is following glucose instability, this doesn't stop just because you go to sleep. You might eat up your last meal at 7.00 or 8.00 and your blood glucose can drop by one or two in the morning. And so for these individuals eating perhaps a piece of cheese and a cracker or perhaps some grapes or an apple with a little piece of chicken or, or meat left over from dinner. A little bit of protein along with carbohydrate will carry that individual through the evening as they sleep and it will help their sleep. Likewise, individuals do well if they wake up and they have forgotten to eat something before bed and they eat a little something, they often can go back to sleep. Cold turkey the refined carbs, there's no way around it. Indeed, many of our individuals in recovery from alcohol go from alcohol to carbohydrate, sugar, coffee addiction. And that is because at the biological basis alcohol is a sugar addiction. So we want to stabilize these individuals with good quality protein. So my approach to getting off refined sugar and flour, wheat addiction is to cold turkey it by going on a high protein complex carb, no grains, vegetable diet for seven days. And I guarantee you craving for sugar disappears often with three to four days, but it really becomes cemented after seven days. So in this approach you eat as much protein and good quality fats as you need to feel satisfied. Most people are not unhappy with this when they hear they can do this in order to detox from the carbs. One to two servings daily of root vegetables with butter and just one fruit a day and people can have as many vegetables as they wish. One of the most important products that I use for mood stability is called glucose tolerance factor. And I have some right here. There are a number of companies that make it. I, I particularly like Allergy Research Group. They, they have very fine quality nutrients. And glucose tolerance factor is primarily chromium. It's a mineral that stabilizes and slows blood glucose uptake in the body, very good for people with diabetes, but very good for mood lability, and not an expensive product. And blood glucose factor chromium is always generally tied to a good niacin NB6, both of which are important for neurological function, focus, mood and stabilizing blood glucose and niacin is a good alternative treatment if you need to lower cholesterol a little bit too. So now the other thing to think about is the delivery of these different products or nutrients. I like to make smoothies and use powders and so you can think about whether you're going to get capsules or powder. And so you've got a wonderful approach in the morning where you can make a smoothie. If you want a chocolate smoothie, add your chocolate, add your Stevia and add your glucose tolerance factor, along with your fiber. Fats are so central to the food, mood, attention. Where do we get good fats? From fish, nuts, seeds, and they must be raw to be medicinal, roasted will not do the trick. If I'm working with someone that's eating fast food, pizzas, Big Macs every day, they may need to transition on to peanuts, on to peanut butter, then on to roasted almonds, so it may, they may not be able to make the leap on to raw nuts. It may be too much for their taste buds. And so we may need to work with them around the spectrum of choice that they need. And, but I want to slowly help them umm… calibrate their taste buds so that they can appreciate foods in their more natural state, not in their sugarfied or and salted state. So for example I've got here, what makes a wonderful snack. You can send kids or yourself, you can take raisins, raw almonds. I've got here some apricots, very good for the immune system. You can put that in a little pouch, baggy, take it off to work or take it off to school. Now many people who haven't been eating well, don't digest well as we've discussed. And so one of the best ways to take these foods also is soak them. So what I did is I took all of these foods and I added water, I covered them with water and I let them soak overnight. And what it does is it begins a sprouting process that makes it much more easily digested. So it doesn't lead to gas. It doesn't lead to indigestion It doesn't tax the liver or the gallbladder and you get a very natural sweet juice that you can put over oatmeal in the morning or just drink as a little sweet juice. I can add it to my smoothie. So everything that we're talking about, we can do double and triple duty and find ways to do things simply and effectively to balance mood. Certainly wild game, animals eggs, eggs are one of the best mood stabilizers there is. I would stay away from your egg substitutes, so your egg whites only. Eggs are a perfect food. They are one of the richest sources of a acetylcholine, that is our memory and focus neurotransmitter in the brain. Indeed, our medications for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's support acetylcholine uptake. But we can prevent by eating two eggs a day. So I make up a batch of 12 eggs. I do a hard boil of eggs on Sunday and then I've got eggs for the rest of the week. I don't have to worry about cooking them. I can throw them into my satchel. Umm… I can put it on my salad. I can have it as a snack. I send it off with the kids to school. So do not be afraid of eggs. Eggs do not raise your cholesterol and even if they did, you want a lot of cholesterol, well, not too much but you want cholesterol in the brain so that your synapses are snappy and they can communicate with each other. We have supplements and capsules and I will show you some here in a little bit and then bottled oils. People complain about the cost of fish oil or and other kinds of bottled medicinal oils and it's true. But you don't need very much, but your liquid oils, your, are much less expensive than your capsules. So if you can, buy your fish oils in liquid form, you will save some money and they are often easier for the kids to take, they taste good, a good quality fish oil tastes very good. Indeed, my favorite fish oils, one is Nordic Naturals, the other is Biotics Research and the others is Barlean. I think those are the three best quality fish oils on the market today. 

00:44:30
[sil.] 

00:44:35
LESLIE KORN And I get them in liquid as I say. And then I can just add it to my smoothie. And the wonderful thing about Nordic Naturals fish oils is that they make gummy bears and they make all kinds of fun umm… treats for kids that are rich in fish oil. And we work with a lot of six and seven year olds with attentional issues, giving them these and they, they love them and it starts to educate them around what they are eating. It's very important, the quality of fish oil is important certainly so that they are low in toxins. You want to avoid rancidity in fish oils. Fish oils are best refrigerated after opening. And then it's very important that you have a good functioning liver. The liver and gallbladder work together to emulsify oils. If you take oil into your body and you, your liver is sluggish, it's overwhelmed, it's fatty liver or it's cerrhotic liver, you are not emulsifying, just like if you put dishes in the sink after you've deep-fried some potatoes umm… and you don't wash your pan with soap, soap is emulsifying those fats just like the liver and the bile salts are emulsifying fats. So if your liver, gallbladder is not working or not working well, you are not getting the most out of your oils. So another principle of mood when we're supplementing with fish oil and I think it's the first place to start, it's, why call this beyond fish oil? Because we're gonna go beyond just supplementing with fish oil is to ensure that you're also eating good foods that stimulate liver function.

LESLIE KORN So I want to add in healthy fats for mood and attention. Coconut oil or coconut cream, fish oil, borage oil, hemp or primrose, olive oil and butter, and then I've given you a smoothie recipe with nutrients that you can add in as a easy simple way once or twice a day to get your fish oil. And I'll talk with you a little bit about dosing and how to use these various oils and what they are good for because they all represent a spectrum of a variety of fats that do different things for our mental cognitive wellbeing. I like to combine a fish oil with a borage and a coconut oil. Borage oil is part of the type of oil called gamma-linoleic acid. It's often the missing piece when people supplement with fish oil. Gamma-linoleic acid, borage oil, evening primrose oil and blackcurrant seed oil is essential for people who have stress and mood liability co-occurring with inflammatory process, umm… skin problems, dermatitis, eczema, joint problems. And so you want to have about 500 milligrams to a thousand milligrams depending upon your age. So children, let's say a child with eczema and stress or acne will do well with about 500 milligrams, an adult will do well with a 1000 milligrams. Then, you can dose anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 milligrams of fish oil. Now 9,000 is a, is a high dose. And again I caution you against prescribing and making recommendations to clients around dosages. Work with a clinician who has a specialty in this. But I want to educate you about this because our clients often come to us, telling us what they are doing and we want some background information to support their healthy choices. So I think everyone can do well with 1,000-2,000 grams a day. In research 9,000 grams have, 9 grams, 9,000 milligrams have been used for the treatment successful of bipolar disorder. They are using up to 20 grams uh, immediately after traumatic brain injury to support the brain. So there's a whole range of dosing, but the important thing to keep in mind is not using just fish oil but to also add in borage oil as a natural anti-inflammatory. Now one of the differences, if you think about borage oil for skin diseases or skin disorders that are highly correlated with stress, evening primrose, very good pre and perimenopause.

LESLIE KORN And I think I don't have it here but let me mention blackcurrant seed oil for women with menstrual cycle irregularities, chronic cramping. Blackcurrant seed oil relaxes uterine contractions during menstruation. So there is mild variations among the value of these different gamma-linoleic acids. Cooking with coconut oil, I think is absolutely a foundational food for the kitchen, not only cooking with it, putting a table spoon in our smoothie every day for cognitive function. It's being used and shown as a prevention for cognitive decline and the dementias. Umm… Coconut is like eggs, another perfect food. You can get whole coconuts, coconut water is really isotonic in during World War II. Coconut water was used as IV fluid. So coconut water, coconut meat, a very rich protein, good quality fat. Coconut's particularly useful as an antiviral and antifungal. So when you are looking at people whose immune systems are depressed due to chronic stress umm… and then they are vulnerable to different kinds of viruses and fungal infections both internally and externally, coconut oil is a very good oil, very rich in lauric acid. And then of course cooking with butter, cooking with olive oil… And again, ensure bitter greens in the diet, that's the key to good liver, gallbladder health. Don't spray those dandelions, pick them and steam them or chop them up in your salad, the arugula, the bitter herbs, all cause the liver to start releasing juices that will emulsify the fats. And we're in the spring time now, so go out and gather your bitter greens. Our brain is made up of DHA. It is made up of fat. We know from research that children who don't get enough essential fatty acids during the first year of life either through breast milk or other foods have learning disorders by the age of 10. So we're looking at long term negative effects of low fat and poor quality fat diets in children. Fish oil is anti-inflammatory, it's an antidepressant, and it's an anxiolytic, it will reduce anxiety. And certainly our, our food such as meats, eggs and fish are a good source of DHA in general. And it's very important that our fat soluble vitamins, vitamins A, E and K are not absorbed without these fats. They are not absorbed without our omega 3's, but also without saturated fats. Our vitamin A is so important to lung health in the immune system. Our vitamins E is so important to circulatory process and antioxidant. And of course vitamin A is so important to bone health and arterial health. I provided you with a little bit of information on coconut oil and its values uh, and it improves cholesterol levels in the body. Very rich in lauric acid and monolaurin, as I mentioned it's antiviral. The same reason that chicken soup which I've made today is known as an antiviral, because of its high levels of lauric acid. And here's a little bit of information, more detail on our plant oils that I've talked about. And these plant oils regulate endocrine function. An endocrine function is altered via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under chronic stress. So we begin to see if we work backwards with our clients who are mood labile, that mood lability is an depression, anxiety, is really the end state that's come from chronic stress and poor diet often over a period of years. 

00:54:15

00:54:20
LESLIE KORN So let's talk a little bit about the basics of good quality foods. They are low-glycemic meaning they are low blood sugar. If we look at all traditional food cultures throughout the world meaning, how we lived and how our ancestors lived in concert with nature, not high levels of sugar. They are anti-inflammatory. They are good quality fats. They are antioxidant rich like our berries and our fruits, all of the blues and the purples and the reds in vegetables and fruits are our antioxidants. And then every culture has fermented foods. I put out some fresh sauerkraut here and you don't need to be wealthy to get your good source of probiotics. Yes, of course you can go by a good probiotic supplement and often times that's very necessary. It's, it can be expensive though at $20 a bottle. Umm… But we can make for a dollar enough sauerkraut or kimchi, that last a week or two. So probiotics are found in fermented foods in every culture and we know that probiotics are so central to the production of our neurotransmitter GABA which is an anxiolytic in the brain. And I've given you some names of our different probiotics, yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, stink eggs. And we have a real problem with the health of intestines in many of our clients because of chronic use of antibiotics which have been highly used really since the late 40s and into the 50s. So we've got chronic loss of good health of our garden which is the intestine of the body. And then of course every traditional food culture has fiber and prebiotics. Prebiotics set the stage just as we till the garden and enrich the garden to make it ready for the seeds and the planting and the growth. So do we need that in our colon and our intestines through the use of different fiber sources. Chia for example. So when I put a tablespoon of this into my smoothie, I'm getting my prebiotic in the morning. Cactus, if you haven't yet tried cactus, I encourage you to go to your local Mexican food store and get some Nopal cactus. Well studied by the Mexican government to lower blood glucose and diabetes and pre-diabetes. It makes a delicious dish cooked or raw and it's a wonderful fiber and very soothing for people with inflammatory bowel syndrome as well. Of course bran and, and then oatmeal, I think steel-cut oats are an excellent breakfast in the morning. I suggest making them along… You can put your sweetened juice from these soaked dried fruits and nuts over it, but again stabilize that oatmeal with an egg. You've got some protein in the nuts, but you want to have plenty of protein to stabilize that carbohydrate. 

00:57:50

00:57:55
LESLIE KORN We know that inflammation underlies depression. Depression is an inflammatory disease. What occurs in the body occurs in the brain. Cytokines which are an inflammatory byproduct block tryptophan conversion to serotonin. We know that there's a limit on the efficacy of SSRIs. For some people they help, many people they don't help and many people have negative side effects. We need alternatives and we need to provide people with information about reducing inflammation just like a car that rusts overtime. Our body rusts. Indeed, the new thinking about ageing is that ageing really is a function of how fast we are rusting. How fast we are oxidizing? Hence, the use of antioxidants. So we can get a lot of improvement in mood and depression if we help a client increase their anti-inflammatory use of foods. Decrease proinflammatory foods, increase their anti-inflammatory foods and nutrients. So what are the inflammatory foods? Certainly the trans fats and the non cold pressed oils, packaged foods, additives, aspartame for example has been found to lower mood. And now I hear that aspartame is going to be repackaged and resold as a product called Amino Sweet, but don't fall for it. Do not use artificial sweeteners. Indeed, avoid artificial foods. White flours, sugar, many people are gluten sensitive. We've got a great gluten craze, anti-gluten craze going on really in this country and throughout much of Europe now. And gluten sensitivity occurs along as spectrum. Certainly celiac disease is the most severe manifestation of gluten, but we know that gluten sensitivity contributes to depression, that's been found throughout many research trials. And so it's very simple. When I'm working with client who presents both with chronic depression and a chronic history of joint sensitivity or a bowel or digestive problems, I will suggest that they do a trial of three to six months off gluten. Going off gluten for two weeks won't do it because gluten is so inflammatory to sensitive people, it will inflame the gut and you need time for those gut walls, those mucus membranes to heal. And many people who are sensitive to gluten are also sensitive to dairy. And so particularly cows' dairy. And so yes there are sensitive salivary tests we can do for antibodies, we can do serum tests and indeed working with a naturopathic or integrative medicine physician, we can do these tests and they, they cost money and they are worth doing. However I like to work with clients in a low cost way to begin with and say, how about let's do an experiment and eliminate this food from your diet and see how you feel? And you don't do too many changes at once, that's another principle. One change at a time. And with that I'm going to take just a one minute break, give you a chance to get up and stretch and then I will come back in one minute and we will continue. Thanks.

01:03:20
LESLIE KORN Okay. I provided you a little bit more information on gluten and depression. If you look at this next slide, gluten is found, it's a protein in grains, umm… wheat, barley, rye in particular. If you eat oatmeal and you're gluten sensitive, oatmeal is often processed near gluten in the factory so you want to obtain what's called gluten-free oatmeal for your diet. Gluten can create inflammation in the intestinal walls as I mentioned. It can create joint pain, brain fog, diarrhea and I just ask people to simply reduce their gluten intake and then eliminate it and find substitutes, rice breads or gluten-free breads if that's what people want to do. Many people are sensitive to other grains and go step by step with them over a three to six month period and then observe mood changes. It's very common that people with bulimia and binge eating disorder are gluten sensitive. And so these individuals are not binging on protein, they are binging generally on carbohydrates, particularly refined carbohydrates such as wheat. This also co-occurs with SAD often times in the winter. So for these individuals they will do better experimenting with a gluten-free diet. I'd like to talk about some proactive ways of dealing with inflammation as it underlies depression. Proteolytic enzymes refer to protein digesting enzymes. When I first went to live in Mexico and many of you know I've spent over 40 years living there and learning from local healers in the jungle. And when I first went there I saw the man when they had freshly slaughtered some beef. Climb up a papaya tree and pick several green papayas, take them off the tree and then slowly slice the papaya at the skin so that this white milky substance oozed out and then they lay it directly over thee fresh meat as a meat tenderizer those of you who've used Adolph's meat tenderizer know that the main ingredient is papain. Papain is a powerful Proteolytic enzyme, it digests protein. Just like bromelain another Proteolytic enzyme found in the unripe pineapple particularly concentrated in the core. So nature has given us these Proteolytic enzymes to eat when we are eating protein to help us digest. Now these days you might not be climbing a papaya tree, but you can obtain at low cost a papain bromelain enzyme to take when you are eating protein if you've got digest problems. However, when these enzymes are taken away from food on an empty stomach, they digest the proteins of inflammation. Indeed, much of what we know about Proteolytic enzymes has been done in the veterinary research industry because people with race horses have been eager to help their horses recover from inflammation more quickly. And so there are products not only for us but for horses and our dogs also who suffer from many of the diseases we do, So propain… Bromelain and papain supplements, dosage is about 1,500 milligrams on an empty stomach two to three times a day. I like a supplement also particularly called Neprinol. It is a variety of Proteolytic enzymes. It's put out by Arthur, Arthur Andrews. So that is one approach to reducing inflammation. The bromelain papain is not too expensive. Neprinol is, is pretty expensive. But then the other thing that I do is I cook daily with turmeric and ginger root. I'm gonna take a little of this tea right now. I'll show you here if you haven't seen fresh turmeric, I bet you're all familiar with fresh ginger. And you can get it…. It smells delicious and you can cook with it, you can make a tea of it. But here is turmeric. Look at the beautiful orange of the turmeric. It doesn't have quite a pungent smell. They are investigating low rates of dementia in East Indian population because of the daily use of turmeric in diet. We know its use as a powerful anti-inflammatory. You can get a turmeric supplement, umm… but if you want to save some money on the turmeric supplements and the anti-inflammatory supplements, you can make a fresh pot of ginger, turmeric tea and it has a lot of uses. So what I've done here is I started out with about twice as much water and then I gently, had a very gentle boil because when you're working with roots you don't steep it like you do with leaves, you do a gentle boil and you boil it down so that it's got a nice yellow, orange flavor. Now if you, I like it just as it is, but you could add some Stevia or even a little bit of honey and we know how antibacterial honey is. So honey is a, is a good choice as an alternative for a refined sugar, just not too much of it. But the other use for this then, let's say I've had a nice cup of this ginger, turmeric tea as I begin my day. I might add it to my smoothie, so I've now got my fiber, my, my fish oil, I'm gonna add some nutrients later, it's nice and sweet, I could add a few tablespoons of this if I want. The other thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to use this as a base later for when I prepare rice, so that when I put my chicken over rice, it's been infused with this anti-inflammatory. But here's the missing piece. In order for turmeric to be absorbed, you need to add black pepper. So if you're buying a supplement with turmeric and ginger as an anti-inflammatory, make sure you look for black pepper in it. If it isn't in it, it's not a high quality substance. And if you're making it, I'm gonna add just a little bit of black pepper to my drink and you think, oh, my goodness, but you know think about your chai tea. Chai tea is made with black pepper, turmeric and all of your wonderful cinnamon and little black tea, very anti-inflammatory drink. So have fun with your turmeric and your ginger root and you can buy it generally at a good Asian store uh, for half the price of what you might spend at some of our more expensive health food stores. So that's where you can begin with anti-inflammatory. And just a side note, cholesterol is a function of inflammation in the body. The liver creates cholesterol to serve as a kind of liquid band aid to all the little nicks inside the arteries due to inflammation. You reduce inflammation, you reduce your cholesterol. You increase your inflammation, you increase your cholesterol. So focus on some of your anti-inflammatory foods, get rid of your pro-inflammatory foods and then supplement actively. And you will make a great progress with clients with depression and mood disorders. So what are some of our basic principles that guide us? There's no one right diet for everyone. Some people are natural vegetarians. Some people are natural carnivores. Nutrition and supplementation can do what most pharmaceuticals can and do it better. Food should be fresh and it should be nutrient dense. Combine a selection of raw and cooked foods, choose foods from the colors of the rainbow. And I'll show you… umm… I've made as one of my salads to show you for today. This is salad in a jar. And we've got all, so many of the colors of the rainbow in that salad. And so I don't talk to my clients about vitamins and minerals to begin with. I just invite them. Go to your local co-op, go attend a free class that's being sponsored, that will walk you around the store and teach you about the various fruits and vegetables if you are not already cooking with them. And select from the colors of the rainbow and you will get the vitamins and the minerals that you need. To begin with, remember, foundational self-care. And people know and can learn what makes them feel best and what makes them feel poorly. I began my talk by saying that we tend to be socially dissociated from the connection between what we're eating and how we feel. I ask my clients to share with me what they think those connections are and to build on that. I think deep down our clients know what they those connections are, what makes them feel well. I ask that of you now. What makes you feel the best and what makes you feel the worst? Then the next step is, how do we emphasize those behaviors that enhance the best and minimize what makes us feel the worst. Our foundational foods are proteins, animal, fish, diary, nuts and legumes. In my longer seminar I go into how we ascertain whether someone is a natural vegetarian or a natural carnivore. If I'm working with an Inuit client, I'm not going to suggest, they start eating tofu and high carb diet. They are biochemically, genetically carnivores, just like vegetarian lifestyle and, and genetics developed in India. And so many people will do well with a more vegetarian diet. That's why there's no one right answer for everyone. And so much about mood dysregulation is rooted in the fact that people are not nourishing their engines, just like a car needs the certain kind of octane, certain kind of fuel in order to hum. If people aren't getting the right fuel for their brain, mind and body, they are going to be imbalanced. So dairy, goat and sheep dairy is a much better choice than cow. Cow dairy is implicated in the development of type 1 diabetes. And unless you are eating raw milk, cow's milk, I think there's no real benefit in eating any cow's dairy. Indeed it's highly associated with these chronic ear infections in children that then lead to high levels of antibiotic use and it leads to that vicious cycle of then poor… Well, full eradication of good bacteria in the gut and then we see chronic emotional problems developed from there. Indeed the gaps diet, the gut and psychology syndrome diet suggest eliminating dairy and gluten as a treatment for the neurodevelopmental disorders. Eggs, one to three eggs daily. Make sure they are antibiotic free and hormone free. And meats, and not to be afraid of your saturated fats, which are powerful anti-inflammatories both internally and externally. Next time you have a tamale making party, get some good lard. I don't mean lard off the shelf. Go to your farmers market and get a good leaf lard, very powerful anti-inflammatory for the body. Your fats, your basic supports. Root vegetables. I've prepared over here several yams, several sweet potatoes. And this is another thing that I've done just to prepare for the week. Now I've got sweet potatoes and I've given you some recipes that I can have just a sweet potato with warm, with butter and, and sea salt. I can, and I want to have the skin. Skin is a tremendous source of fiber, very rich in vitamin A. Indeed, it's theorized the people of Okinawa lived to 110 because they eat sweet potatoes every day. Very good for the immune system. And sweet potatoes is another in the principle of our idea of substitutions. When you're coming off of sugar you miss that sugar taste in the mouth. Supplement with a sweet potato. Supplement with your root vegetables that you've baked because they get really the natural sugars come out and they can be very satisfying. The other thing I'll do is I will make a kind of a dessert out of whipped sweet potato. I might add a little bit of whole cream to it umm… and even a tablespoon of honey if I really want something sweet, but it's not even necessary. So there's lots of things to do with sweet potato. The other thing I'll do is I'll slice them and then on the grill I'll put on just a little balsamic vinegar and grill them on both sides and throw them on top of my salad that I'm taking to work with me. So root vegetables are a central approach to substituting for the sweet tooth. I've talked about fresh greens, fruits, legumes and grains are another source to think about. Many people are very sensitive to legumes as well as grains. I think I've reviewed some of these nutritional myths. I think the one I haven't talked about is about soy. If you look at traditional Asian culture, soy is generally eaten in fermented form, which means it's already broken down. Your soy protein isolates are not healthy for you. They have been shown to depress thyroid function which affects mood, hypothyroid co-occurs with depression often times. Very difficult to digest and it depresses trypsin as well, digestive enzyme. So if you are currently eating soy products, they are not a healthy protein alternative unless they are fermented. Your meso, your tamari, but your wheat free tamari that I think I've got right out here to show you. 

01:20:00

01:20:05
LESLIE KORN The principles of substitutions I've begun talking about that. Substitute sweet potatoes for your bread and sweets, make smoothies with Stevia, freshly made cocoa without sugar, add your Stevia. If you are going to use honey as a transitional sugar product, it's only better than your refined sugars. Use honey or maple syrup. If you think about cane sugar, if you have ever traveled into the tropics you can chew on that wonderful cane, sugarcane it's sweet. But what else does it have? It has fiber, it has B vitamins, it doesn't shoot into your system like the drug of refined sugar. So look for sugar in their natural state. I've given you on the URL a coffee detox protocol. If people are anxious and regulating mood with coffee or caffeine, help them reduce it by going on to decaffeinated coffee. And one of our best substitutes for coffee is green tea. And green tea is a little known anxiolytic. I like green tea as a powder. Meaning, I, I try to find a very good quality Sencha green tea. I can get it at the food co-ops or get it online. It's much more powerful than green leaf green tea. It's okay for the office setting to introduce people, but a medicinal level and an anxiolytic level of green tea should be in high dose, higher dose powder form, very profound antioxidant. But green tea is rich in theanine. Theanine is an anxiolytic amino acid. This is why we drink green tea and our energy goes up, but it doesn't become anxiety provoking in the same way that coffee can do that, give us the jitters, because nature has given us a balance. As it energizes us, it relaxes us as well. I add it to my smoothies, I might sprinkle it on my salad. You can even get an ice cream maker and make whole fat green tea Stevia ice cream for the kids or make popsicles with them. And indeed, I do all of these cooking classes with the kids as a way not to only have fun but to teach them about some of these principles. I've mentioned a little bit about water and soluble fibers. Oats are an anxiolytic. It's actually why oats straw herb or oatmeal is very relaxing. It's not a great breakfast food for that reason. It's deeply relaxing and unless if you're going to go out and need to perform, you're going to perform better and your mood and glucose is going to be more stable only if you have more protein than oatmeal. Oatmeal makes a great evening meal. Indeed the principle of mood regulation throughout the day is to load your carbs, excuse me, load your proteins early. And throughout lunch, your power lunch of proteins and vegetables and perhaps some fruit in the afternoon to keep your blood sugar up but then, your carb is at night. So you're stabilizing your carbs with proteins, but you are emphasizing proteins throughout the day. And as you move into the evening, your carbs are your relaxing foods. Have your oatmeal or your gluten free pancakes or your sandwiches or whatever you're going to have, your baked potatoes, load your starchy carbs if that's what you're going to have later on in the day for relaxation.

LESLIE KORN Vitamin D deficiency, I think we're very much aware that 98% of our population is vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually not a vitamin, it's a hormone. I like to take my vitamin D through liquid. 

01:24:30
[sil.] 

01:24:35
LESLIE KORN I can get high dose vitamin D. And in fact I haven't had any today, so bear with me. I can just put a drop under my tongue and get 2,000 units of vitamin D. Vitamin D is highly correlated with both depression and pain, meaning, a deficiency of vitamin D. So when you're working with someone who is depressed and has co-occurring chronic pain disorder, they should have vitamin D levels checked. It's not an expensive blood test or if they can't just start, they should supplement with vitamin D. I've provided you here with some dosing that Dr. Holick from the Department of Medicine suggests, oral dose of 50,000 units of vitamin D once a week for eight weeks where people are deficient in vitamin D. And a general rule is supplementing with 2,000 to 4,000 units a day. You, you want to, I'm giving you a range of doses, but everyone is going to be particular in their needs. Depression and pain respond to vitamin D supplementation. And of course along with vitamin K is essential for women in menopause.

01:26:00
LESLIE KORN So what are some additional principles for treatment with anxiety or anxious depression? I treat a lot of college students and a lot of people who are vegetarian who are not true vegetarians. Meaning, biochemically their body… It's not the right fuel for their body. If I put the wrong fuel into my Mercedes diesel engine, that engine is going to go kaput and that is what we're seeing with a lot of anxious depressed low energy fatigued vegetarians. Now as a recovering vegetarian of almost 30 years, I have nothing at all, no problem at all with vegetarian diet. However, vegetarianism, while it may have a basis in environmental health, in emotional and spiritual health, our, our concerned and love for animals, it is not necessarily the correct biochemical choice for an individual. And so when I treat someone who is a vegetarian or even a vegan and they are presenting with anxiety or panic or an anxious depression, I want to look at their diet. And this is where we use our best coaching and support for people who we know will benefit from incorporating more animal protein into their diet because proteins are the building blocks of neurotransmitters. The amino acids in proteins support neurotransmitter function in the brain, nothing else does, and not only that, but when someone is on a high carb and many vegetarians are addicted to sugar and addicted to carbs because they are not getting enough good quality protein. When someone's on that kind of a diet with a lot of vegetable and fruit content, their blood can get a little bit too alkaline. I don't want to go into this too much, it's much more of our, our longer seminar, but just to get you thinking about this concept of biochemical individuality. And if we are off balanced with who we are metabolically, what our endocrine system needs, what our engine needs to function, then our brain, mind function is going to be off and this manifests in anxiety. So what do I do with these individuals? I increase their vinegars. One of the best vinegars you can use is this Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar. If you get a good Apple Cider Vinegar, I don't mean a pasteurized vinegar off the shelf, I mean one with active culture in it. I use it on salads. You can actually even put it into a foot soak or a bath and absorb it through the skin. And if you are a tired psychotherapist, if you increase the amount of vinegar in your daily food or take a vinegar bath, you will notice your energy start to come up a little bit. The other product I use with these individuals is ortho-phosphoinositol. It is phosphorous and again I'm not suggesting that you recommend this per se, but I want you to know that these products are out there. It's a very acidifying product which helps the body and the blood acidify, not only do we use it to breakdown bone, spurs and gallstones, it will dissolve gallstones as well. We use it short term for one to three months. Add about 30 drops to a little bit of water first thing in the morning. You must brush your teeth because it's highly acidic on the enamel of the teeth. And it will raise up energy and fatigue. It will reduce panic. We use it with clients who have both anxiety and asthma as well. So we increase the vinegars, increase meats. I'm going to show you my bone broth in a little bit. And this is a way I begin with people who are vegetarian, who may not want to eat meat, they, they have prohibitions about chewing flesh, but they may be willing to make the first step by incorporating a mineral rich gelatin rich bone broth into a soup that they make or maybe they will even eat out at a restaurant that's using these bone broths. A very inexpensive approach to medicinal food. I certainly want to increase oatmeal. Celery is another anxiolytic food. And then fermented foods, recall the fermented foods increase GABA in the gut. Dietary stressors like caffeine and sugar go without saying, reducing those. And then hydrotherapy, a very natural support for improving sleep in the evening for reducing anxiety is magnesium sulfate baths, about one cup of magnesium sulfate to a bath. Now what I would do with a client who's anxious and depressed… umm… Well, certainly I would look at what the predominating mood is, but I might use vinegar to raise mood but I would also use magnesium to relax. And you could do vinegar of baths for a week and then switch to magnesium sulfate, you could see what the client feels best doing. You might do vinegar one night, magnesium sulfate the next. Magnesium sulfate is in a warm bath, really help people absorb magnesium which we know will help relax muscles, very good for asthma and anxiety. And then of course some basic supplements. I think if you are to begin with one basic supplement beyond fish oil is your B vitamin complex. There are a lot of very good B vitamins on the markets. I particularly like this one called Bio-Glycozyme Forte. It's put out by biotics. It's a natural B vitamin and they also include chromium and vanadium in it, so it's designed to balance blood glucose. It supports neurological health and it supports, it reduces cravings. It's a very good all round B vitamin. And so you've got your fish oil, you've got your smoothie with your fiber, you've got your Stevia sweetened, you are slowly building up your repertoire of what you are taking throughout the day. And, one of the things I guess I'd, I'd like to mention now with the Bio-Glycozyme is that they are pills. And so one of the values I find in these pills particularly with kids is that if I can't find a good B vitamin in liquid or powder such as this one, I can clean up my coffee grinder and, with rice, just clean it out, throw some rice in and spin it around and clean it out, and then grind up your pills and then store it as a powder as I have here, let's say with adrenal complex powder. And then you can use a little bit of that in the smoothie and it's painless and yet it makes a make difference in mood stabilization. The other… I've mentioned magnesium. The reason I like magnesium baths is that it is absorbing magnesium through the skin, but you can also take magnesium orally before bed to help sleep. We tend to dose to bowel tolerance. Meaning, you take magnesium until you get a little lose in the bowels and then you back off from that dose. And that's the very scientific way that we understand how much magnesium the body needs. I've given you a list of some other fermented foods. I'd like to talk just briefly about lithium. Lithium carbonate is used often to treat bipolar disorder, but we've got a natural lithium. Lithium is a mineral at its heart. Indeed, some of the original research done on lithium and mood was done in Texas and places where people drank and do drink lithium rich waters and where there's no aggression, no violence, no domestic violence. And so we know that lithium regulates circadian rhythm, it regulates mood. But we've got lots of side effects that are challenging with lithium carbonate. So I incorporate lithium orotate into my regiment with bipolar diagnosis. Indeed, if you live in an area where you can take lithium baths, I suggest you go soak in those waters. We have here in Washington, Mount Rainier, also known as Mount Tahoma. We've got mineral springs that are rich in lithium and local American-Indians refer to these waters as laughing springs because they make one giggle. So stabilizing are they to mood and a sense of wellbeing. So look into lithium orotate. Dr. Jonathan Wright, physician who works with nutrition is a big proponent of this as a neuron-protective mineral. So let's talk a little bit about recipes. We've got about 20 minutes left in our time together. I've talked about turmeric ginger root tea and I encourage you to make it and use it in all the ways I've suggested. Let me quickly make a smoothie for you and just show you the process because remember, our challenge is how are we gonna make food that's inexpensive. I'm gonna add some blue berries today. But in the past for example, yesterday I made a smoothie with coconut, coconut cream and coconut oil and then I added pineapple and I had a nice kind of and Pina Colada. So I've got my blue berries in there. You know once you've, you know have experienced measuring, you don't need to measure, you can just… I'm gonna have a teaspoon. I want a lot of brain power today. Now I, because I do a lot of traveling and I'm exposed to a lot of different environments, I want to really support my hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. I want to support the stress plants. So I have a wonderful product that I really enjoy called Dr. Wilson's Dynamite Adrenal and its got vitamins, minerals, herbs and glandulars. So I've got in a powder a lot of what I need just to support my adrenal glands. But I'm gonna add a little bit more of adrenal cortex. I've got my glucose tolerance so I can stay stable and happy. I'm gonna throw in some of my Stevia. Now if I didn't have time to cook, I wanted to show you these two protein powders.

01:38:00
LESLIE KORN I'm gonna throw in a nice big heaping teaspoon of my fiber. Pea protein and whey protein. Whey protein's been shown in the clinical setting to be very helpful. It raises tryptophan levels, very helpful for people with binge eating or bulimia. It's a wonderful source of protein. If you have any kind of casein or whey, both the proteins in milk. If you are sensitive, you could go with the pea protein. And so I might put a tablespoon of pea protein in there. Now I used almond milk today, but I might for a change I might use coconut milk as well. And as I mentioned there are several options for coconut. I've got coconut oil and Barlean's makes a great coconut oil. I can also get an Asian food restaurant or a, a store. I can get coconut cream. I can mix it with vanilla for the kids. I can really play with these. And the other thing that I have particularly when the kids umm… or even if I just don't have time to cook or eat raw that week, Barlean's makes some great greens. They have a wonderful greens with chocolate silk, I can add that. Though I don't think it's gonna go well with the blue berries. I might have done that if I just used a banana. And the other thing I did is I cut up bananas yesterday. I wrapped them and froze them so I can have a little bit of frozen banana, have a lot of rich potassium. And so I can have my mixed fruit in greens and then I've got my plain greens. I've got, as I mentioned these different kinds of fish oils, umm… one from Barlean's and one from biotics. And so you will work with the different oils, the different dosing, how they taste, but the best oils will not, you know, it won't repeat on you. Now if I'm working particularly with someone who's got a lot of inflammatory process, this is another product I use called Bio-Inflamatory Berry Plus by Biogenesis. Again, these things need to taste good. What I do often times in my clinic is I will have samples. I don't want to suggest that a client go buy something and then they turnout they don't benefit from it or they don't like it. So I like to provide samples in the waiting room. I make these teas, I give them recipes, and so they really get to sample them out. And this kind of work lends itself to a PsychoEd, mind, body group as well. I think there's a very powerful niche open to all of us to provide these kinds of health in recovery groups through this kind of educational practice process. So let's see, if I want to put anything else in my… I think I'm gonna pass on the protein, I had my eggs, umm… and so I'm gonna leave it at that and then I'm just gonna stir it up. 

01:41:25

LESLIE KORN And the other, the other thing to keep in mind when you're making this is the more fruit or the more ice, the thicker it will be and if you want it to be more of a drink, you can have a little bit more liquid and less fruit. I've made these and put them into ice cube containers with little popsicles sticks. And then I or I don't tend to but the kids really can enjoy, salud. And I can have this for breakfast and when I'm taking off for work I've got my salad in a jar. And I've got my hard boiled eggs. I can take one of my yams and I'm set for the day. So the other recipe I would like to share with you besides the smoothie is the lemon garlic ginger chicken. And I've made two dishes. And let me explain why I've done what I've done. One is a stew in a crock-pot. And when my clients say to me, I don't cook and I don't know how to cook, I say, get a crock-pot. You can get a crock-pot for $30. You can throw things into a crock-pot, it will do the work for you. So I put this together last night. I did all of my food preparation as I said in two hours yesterday. I got a whole chicken, I cut it in half, I put half the chicken in the crock-pot. And you will see here the wastages of my, my cut up vegetables. So I wanted to be efficient, so I thought about all the vegetables I wanted to use in my salad, in my crock-pot, in my chicken soup and then, what I'll show you in a little bit is the bone broth. So I want to be very efficient. I got all my vegetables together and they were all going to do service in different dishes. So I cut up my chicken, put half in the crock-pot along with the vegetables, including potatoes in the stew. Now this is, there's garlic and ginger and lemon in this and when I take it out and serve it, I'm going to sprinkle some more lemon over it. But, I could just as easily add a white wine to it without the garlic. Well, I could keep the garlic in it, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't add the lemon or I might add a little bit of sherry to it. So you can have a similar recipe but just alter a little bit about it. and I chose chicken today but you could use lamb, you could use beef, you could use beans, the crock-pot I think is the first step that people can use if they don't know how to cook or they don't have time to cook because then I woke up this morning and I have my food in here, not just for me but for my family and I've got a lot for the week. At the same time I took the other half of the chicken and I wanted more of a broth. So I've made a chicken soup. And what you will see here then is, I'm going to take the breast meat out and I'm going to let it cool and then this, once this cools can be made into chicken salad for the week. And I've still got my chopped up vegetables there to work with my onions and my parsley and my celery for the chicken salad. But meanwhile in the chicken soup I've got a wonderful broth and that broth is going to become very gelatinous and I'm gonna cool the, the leg too and I'm going to bone it, so I'll have pieces of chicken in it. And then I'm going to, I can add the rice that I've made with my turmeric, ginger tea earlier. And so the key to making your soup is that you cook your chicken first in your soup. It will, I would say you cover your half a chicken and cook it for about an hour at a low simmer. You bring it a boil then lower it to a simmer. Don't add your vegetables until you're done cooking the chicken and then all your vegetables in, so they don't get overcooked. And then I'd like to show you what I can end up with here. 

01:46:50

01:47:00
LESLIE KORN I've got a wonderful gelatin. Gelatin is so essential for our wellbeing. It is a very assimilable form of protein. Now we tend to think of jello and indeed jello makes a great, not the jello with sugar and food diet in it, but real gelatin with a good fruit juice umm… or fruit is a very good high protein dessert. But I also like to collect the gelatin once you let your soup cool and then you can make your rice with that. I actually give a dollop of it to my dog every day because gelatin is so important for our joint health and it's very good because many of our clients are not digesting because they haven't eaten well for, maybe forever, but they are in recovery. And they can't take very overwhelming foods. But gelatin and, and the gels that come out of our broths such as this, the chicken soup is very easily assimilated and it's, it's quite delicious. So with this I can store this in the freezer and then make a whole other soup out of it. And I want to show you what I did with all of the, the stuff that was left from… I've got all of these vegetables that we tend to throw away, but hold on to them because I want to show you this bone broth. And I've got here cooking marrow bones. Again, one needn't buy a steak to get the benefits of a good quality organic humanely raised farmed animal. So these are marrow bones and you could go to the finest restaurant in New York like I did not too long ago and be served roasted marrow bones for quite a bit of money. But you can buy very efficiently marrow bones and you cover them with water and the key to extracting the minerals from the bones, and remember minerals enliven our brain and balance our mood, is adding a dash of vinegar. So I added a little red wine vinegar, but you could add some of the apple cider vinegar as well. And so now that these, these bones have been cooking for several hours, I'm going to add all of this kind of leftover vegetables that I'm not going to use for anything except to start to add to my bone vegetable broth, that will be very powerful in terms of nutrients. And again, I haven't wasted anything and I have made use of many things here. So let's see if there's anything else I wanted to share with you. Oh, one thing. This, this which looks like an abstract painting here. This is my cold bone broth. And what I'm going to do next… Now that, the fat has risen to the surface is I'm going to just scrape off this fat. There will be plenty of it left throughout and then I'm going to use this as the basis for my French onion soup or from, just a warm mineral broth that I can throw into the thermos and take to the office with me, as I'm trying to nourish and come back from anxiety, come back from panic, comeback from not being able to digest very well. And then, I think I've shown you this salad in a jar. What I've done is I have made two different salad dressings again. Remember, we're looking for efficiency. While I was cooking yesterday I made a balsamic vinaigrette and a red wine vinaigrette and a third one that I will make today for the week is a lemon tahini with garlic. So I want to add my garlic, very powerful anti-inflammatory. And so I've got my salad dressings made for the week. I don't have to get it out of a bottle. It's… Your best medicine is to make it yourself. And so I basically put the dressing in the bottom and then you put the hardest vegetables, like the root vegetables. I've got carrots, I've got raw beets. By the way raw beets are the best food for you liver there is. So eat your beets. Add a little bit of yogurt to them, cold or hot and make a wonderful food, medicinal food. I've got my onions and, then I go up to my leafy greens and my cheese. And I've made a half a dozen of these for this week. I did all yesterday. So I can just go and then I can change out what I want to bring with it as a protein source and it's all ready to go.

LESLIE KORN So we've got just a few minutes and I'm going to wrap up here. And make sure I covered everything I wanted to share with you. Oh, one more thing. There was always so much and so much fun to have. If you look at those carrots over here, you will see not just the parsley on top of the carrots which is very good for the kidneys by the way, very natural diuretic, but you will see carrot greens. And it's one reason why I love to buy especially during the summer, carrots with their greens because they make a wonderful pesto. So, yes, basil is a wonderful food, it's a wonderful anti-inflammatory food, but use your carrot greens and grind them up with walnuts or pine nuts and garlic and olive oil and you've got a wonderful paste to put over your vegetables or your, your fish or whatever you like to use it for. So let me just finish up here with some behavioral nutritional principles. We want to increase the food mood connection that our clients identify. We want to reduce the disconnection and the disassociation they feel. And it's also important to bring the whole family in. There's nothing that leads umm… to failure than having a one person in the family want to make change and the others don't. So try to engage, this is a whole family process and particularly with children. We're using this approach to helping parents learn how to cook and help the kids learn how to cook and take responsibility for what they are putting into their bodies as a way to avoid, to avoid some of stimulant medications. Add healthy foods that are easy to exchange and substitute. Reduce the toxic foods. 

01:54:25

LESLIE KORN Reduce the ways in which we prepare food that takes away the vitamins and the minerals. I'm gonna show you my microwave. I use it as a place to store herbs. Use that Lazy Susan for all of your herb and spice needs. Stop using the microwave, it does nothing for you and indeed it destroys nutrients and foods. And research shows that it targets the GABA receptors in the brain when it's on, negatively. Reduce your inflammatory foods. Eliminate the dead foods. Those are the over processed foods, and the packaged foods. Move from no vegetables to canned vegetables to frozen vegetables to fresh vegetables, that's kind of the order in which people should be changing along the spectrum. Get rid of all the additives and the preservatives and all the metabolic byproducts. And thank you so much. If you are interested in this approach as it sits in the context of whole mind, body trauma treatment, umm… you can read my clinical textbook Rhythms of Recovery Trauma, Nature, and the Body. I am very pleased that publishing with Norton next year. A clinical guide to mental health nutrition for those of us of mental health clinicians to expand on the kind of content that we have done today. Please feel free to be in touch with any questions. Join me at my seminars in Oregon or California. And I know in 2015 we'll have some new ones scheduled. Thank you.
