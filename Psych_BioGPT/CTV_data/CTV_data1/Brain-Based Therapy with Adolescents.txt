Brain-Based Therapy with Adolescents with John B. Arden, PhD 

00:00:00
Myelination and the Adolescent Brain 

00:00:00
Authoritarian: telling their children exactly what to do 

00:00:00
Laissez Faire: allowing their children to do whatever they wish 

00:00:00
Authoritative: providing rules and guidance without being overbearing 

00:00:00
Negligent: disregarding the children, and focusing on other interests 

00:00:00
Why do most 16-year-olds drive like they're missing a part of their brain? - BECAUSE THEY ARE. 

00:00:25
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD For many therapists, seeing adolescents can be a little uncomfortable because adolescents, uh, often are uncomfortable in social situations. And, uh, certainly that attunement between, uh, uh, therapists and client, uh, a lot of times picks up on the emotional climate in, in the room. Uh, it's important to think about what's going on in their brain. And if the therapist understands that there is more going on th-, uh, in terms of affect regulation and the difficulty with affect regulation, then the therapist can, in some ways, kind of act as their extra aide at, uh, controlling affect, by helping the adolescent through - if you want to think in terms of training wheels - uh, control, uh, his or her affect. Almost like, uh, you're pacing the adolescent. So if you think in terms of affect and anxiety being in the room, with a little bit of edge, and that adolescent kind of needing some pacing to kind of get into a rhythm of affect regulation, then the therapist may not jump to a counter-transference mode, but rather use that transference to help calm the adolescent, to kind of meet them where they are but actually be a pace ahead and help develop this overall easing quality. Myelin is this, this oligodendro glial cell, uh, uh, material that coats axons. So if you think in terms of a neuron, you have a nucleus, you have the part of the neuron that sends out information, called the "axon", then you have another part of the neuron that reaches out to grab information, called the "dendrites". So development involves new synaptic connections that, the growth of axons, and, uh, the coating of those axons, and the coating is called "myelin". In fact, myelin is one Third cholesterol, that is good cholesterol, uh, one Third, um, uh, essential fatty acids, and, uh, oligodendro glial cells. So the coating of the coating of the axons actually facilitates better firing and more efficiency, so if you think about electrical wiring, for example, uh, the wiring is coated by plastic or rubber to facilitate better firing, and if the, those wires aren't covered with the plastic or the rubber, then those wires could get shorted out. And we know that, certainly in the brain, uh, demyelination, uh, is a terrible neurological problem, for example, uh, M.S. is a demyelinating, uh, disease. So, adolescents are busy myelinating the prefrontal cortex, making the prefrontal cortex much more efficient, much more, uh, capable, in navigating through the brain. Now, the prefrontal cortex is essentially the brain's brain, or sometimes people refer to it as the "executive brain". So, being able to orchestrate, uh, the activity of a-, all the other, uh, parts of the brain is quite a job, and being able to, uh, have that sense of wisdom and, uh, broad thinking is part of what we'd call maturity. So the prefrontal cortex really is what made civilization possible, and it wha-, it's what makes adulthood possible. So, when you're thinking terms of wisdom, not only affect regulation but seeing the larger picture, and being able to defer, uh, gratification for a greater goal down the line, that's what the prefrontal cortex does for a living, and that's what, uh, adulthood is all about. Now if you mess up the prefrontal cortex during adolescence by substance abuse, or getting a head injury, or something, then you get all sorts of difficulty with, uh, all the things that, uh, the prefrontal cortex does for a living. Not just affect regulation, but you get poor decision making, you get, , uh, some types of, uh, uh, antisocial behavior, certainly, uh, huge numbers of, of people that are in the criminal justice system had prefrontal cortex difficulties, uh, and those difficulties aren't always as the result of a, a traumatic brain injury or something like that. Sometimes it's, it's because of very poor upbringing, uh, parents that don't help their children to learn how to have better executive control. And in that case what we're talking about is better prefrontal cortex, uh, maturation. The adolescent brain is going through a massive remodeling. Uh, as much as 50% of the synaptic connections in the prefrontal cortex are pruned in a process of the brain sculpting to adapt to the environment in which the adolescent lives. And also the myelination of the prefrontal cortex is particularly important and in fact doesn't get completely, uh, myelinated until roughly about age 25 for women, and perhaps as late as 30, uh, for men. So if you think about the development of the prefrontal cortex as being so critical to the development of an adult, uh, the adolescent is learning how to navigate through the world, learning how to control his or her affect, and various areas of the prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex, which is, uh, generally, uh, more mature earlier than is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Uh, the various areas of the prefrontal cortex have a whole lot to do with how well the adolescent attends to his or her environment, how well he or she, uh, feels at one with others, and how they, uh, uh, adapt to people that they're living with. So, so, one of the things that's happening, besides the major hormonal shifts that occur, uh, during pubescence, is that, uh, the, uh, surge of, uh, activity in the social arena for the adolescents becomes very, very demanding. And if that person's, uh, prefrontal cortex is not operating well, in terms of affect regulation, uh, some kids can develop social phobia. So if you think of it, the orbitofrontal cortex has major connections with the amygdala. And in fact the, uh, uh, orbitofrontal cortex largely keeps the amygdala in check, but if the adolescent, uh, feels a surge of anxiety and doesn't have a very well-developed orbitofrontal cortex, that, uh, surge of affect can overcome and essentially highjack the prefrontal cortex. And then the cortex, of course, can develop all sorts of theories about the why they're feeling that anxiety. And if it's in a social context they can create, over a period of time, providing they start to avoid what makes them anxious, they can become progressively more anxious and develop this incredible fear of having social contact, and meeting new people, and, uh, uh, modulating their anxiety in social situations. So social phobia is very, very common, uh, in adolescents, and can get worse if the, uh, the developing, uh, uh, teenager, uh, avoids what makes them anxious. And what you're going to see with, uh, Colin a little later is that he, after, uh, pubescence, after this, as he described it, big event in his, uh, uh, household whereby his father had a big party and he felt very anxious and everything, subsequently he started to avoid, uh, social situations, and for all intents and purposes, painted himself into a corner whereby the amygdala was running the show and, and the, oh, his cortex developed all these reasons why he was feeling so anxious, saying essentially that he can no longer really tolerate even looking in people's eyes, uh, so that he was so overcome by anxiety. So here you have, in a sense, the amygdala hijacking the prefrontal cortex. So what we want to be doing with kids like this is helping them learn to have better mastery over the over-activity of the amygdala, and having better affect regulatory control. Uh, and with someone like Colin, we want to do it gradually and incrementally, so that he can get a better sense of mastery over his overwhelming sense of, uh, anxiety. Now, providing he has good parenting, and good support at home, uh, for example, authoritative parents as opposed to authoritarian or laissez faire parents, then his parents can help him navigate through the world, get, make sense of it, and certainly be the place where "the buck stops here", so to speak, but at the same time explain why, uh, they're saying, "No, you can't stay out until 2 A.M.," and, or, or whatever. Uh, so, rather than let the, uh, child learn on their own, as is the case with the so-called laissez faire, the permissive, uh, parents, or the other extreme, authoritarian parents, the authoritative parents are sometimes called "the inductive model" parents, are explaining why that, "Uh, no, no, no, you know, you can't, uh, take the cap-, car out until 3 A.M., uh, you know, uh, but let me tell you why," uh, that they child can develop a better sense of why these so-called rules are there without just hearing, "No, I'm the parent. That's all there is to it," so to speak. Now, along the way, of course, parents, or, uh, individuals, they have faults just like anybody else, and, uh, just as during earlier childhood, a good enough parent, the Winnicottian model of "good-enough mothering", uh, is critically important because we do make mistakes, and we can work out those mistakes among ourselves, and we can call that "repairing the impingements". And that's critically important during adolescence as well, because people do step on one another's toes, and they can adjust to the, uh, imperfections of, of, uh, the other person and go "Oops. I'm sorry. I stepped no your toe. I didn't really mean it here." But, uh, uh, we can move on together and, and actually not only repair the impingement, but also strengthen the relationship. Uh, ad i-, often found in Time, Newsweek Magazine that Allstate Insurance, uh, has played, and, uh, it's a picture of a brain, and the title says, "Why do adolescents drive like mi-, they're missing part of their brain?" and, uh, the sub-title is, "Because they are," and there's a car indentation as if a piece of a puzzle is taken out of the prefrontal cortex. And if you can think about the prefrontal cortex as being that part that makes decisions, uh, follows through on, "Geez, if I do this, then this might happen, and tha-, that might happen," and having that logical sequence of, of, uh, a chain of events. Uh, then you can think about the adolescent, eh, uh, uh, being, to some degree, at risk of learning from their mistakes when it sometimes can be a little dangerous. Uh, and if it is the case that some adolescents put themselves way out on a, a limb, uh, going, uh, to extremes, uh, to get a sense of excitement, uh, then sometimes they can put themselves into rather precarious situations. I can think of myself as an example. Between the ages of 22 and 23 I circled the globe for one year, and I went to some, hmmm, kind of dicey areas, uh, that, uh, I wouldn't go to nowadays, uh, because they were a little dangerous, but I thought that nobody was gonna shoot at me, and, of course, I even did hear gunfire around me. I was on the Golan Heights and, uh, uh, the Syrian-Israeli border up in the Golan triangle, up in, uh, the borders of Burma, and, and, uh, Thailand and Laos, and all that. And, uh, I didn't think anyone was gonna be hassling me. So that's partly why we send young people to war, because the sergeant says, "Hey, you guys. Run up that hill and get that, take command of that hill," and, uh, the soldiers might, uh, even compete with one another to see who could get up at the hill the, uh, more quickly. Uh, for a adult, uh, say, that's got a fully myelinated prefrontal cortex, they might go, "Are you kidding? You want me to rush that hill? There's a guy with a machine gun up there. I think I'm gonna hold off a little bit, until somebody else takes out the machine gun." Uh, so there's a little bit more, um, uh, shall we say, uh, caution, uh, with some adolescents, and I don't mean to be overstating this, because some adolescents are actually in the other extreme, overcome by anxiety, and not willing to, uh, take a step forward. Those, of course, with, uh, various types of anxiety, perhaps even social anxiety. Because adolescents have to do more to get a dopaminergic surge, in other words, uh, uh, one of the, uh, main neurotransmitters in the brain that seems to be, not be well utilized during the adolescent's, called dopamine, have to do more to get a release of dopamine, uh, the become a little bit more dramatic. And, you know, the movie industry knows this. The movie industry is shooting for the 13 to 22-year-old crowd. And relative to a movie, a film, say, 60, 65 years ago, when Humphrey Bogart got shot he just, you know, crumpled over and died, and you didn't really see any blood at all. Nowadays, in a movie, you've got to see not only the blood kind of pour out on the floor and everything, but maybe even an eyeball popping out, and maybe 16 car crashes beforehand, to get everybody's attention. And certainly that 13 to 22-year-old-crowd, because they have to have more activity going on to kind of wake them up and, and get excited. Uh, so, perhaps, with, uh, some adolescents, and again, there's a whole spectrum here, uh, that social interactions happen to be a little more dramatic as, as well. Sometimes there's a little bit more drama: who gets rejected, who doesn't get rejected, and that, those rejections get a little bit more volatile one way or the other. And that has a huge premium for adolescents because that affiliatory quality, uh, that is so critical, "How do I fit in the world and the social, uh, network," has a whole lot to do with one's sense of identity, uh, that it can be rather, uh, um, emotionally bruising at times. Uh, I sometimes think of adolescents as wearing a, uh, exoskeleton, much like, uh, you know, uh, insects have, don't have an internal skeleton, they have an exo-, uh, exoskeleton, meaning that they have to overplay who the are by what they wear, instead of who they are, so they can just exude the sense of who they are. And some of that exoskeleton has to do with what group the are in or aren't in, so if you go to high school you can see the, this group over there, the s-, the skaters, and the stoners, and the rockers, and the jocks, and, and so on. And their affiliatory quality is almost like what colors they're wearing, so to speak. Um, so, these social relationships are charged social relationships, and when a adolescent develops social phobia, that sense of rejection can be all the more powerful, far more powerful than, let's say, a fully-mature adult that might get rejected at work, not getting invited to a party, or whatever. Not getting invited to a party as an adolescent, that's a big thing, uh, and can be a source of, uh, rejection, and hurt, and resentment, uh, for some time to come. So you'll see, in the session with Colin, uh, that, uh, he is, overcome by, uh, social anxiety, and, uh, having a great deal of difficulty modulating his affect in social situations, and in fact he even mentions, uh, having a really, uh, difficult time, uh, looking at people straight in the eye. He's OK with looking at, uh, teachers, uh, but his peers he has a pretty difficult time with, and that, uh, affect regulation, you could just, uh, call it, uh, has a whole lot to do with that orbitofrontal cortex calming down the amygdala. So in the session I introduced the concept of the amygdala and rather than use the word "amygdala" I'm using the word "Amy" because it's easy to remember and, in fact, if you think about "taming Amy", it's much easier to think about taming cute little Amy than it is some complicated Greek word. Uh, he seems to resonate with that a little bit and it's better able to kind of get a sense of, "Oh, OK. So over a period of time, uh, I can, uh, calm Amy down, and, uh, even have my birthday party, uh, down the line." So it's very good to meet you. So what brings you here? 

00:19:55
COLIN Well, I, uh, um, this is something that I've kind of wanted to do for a while, but it's, uh, it's scary. You know? And, um, I kind of have, uh, some social problems. Um, and so my mom kind of pushed that I come here, so I'm here because of her, but I really want some place where I can just actually talk and not worry about everything I say. 

00:20:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD When you said, uh, "My mom wants me to do these sorts of things," what, what sorts of things? 

00:20:40
COLIN Well, whenever I meet new people, it's just this really intense anxiety, and, um, like I, just shaking hands, it's a big thing for me. And I pull on my jeans whenever I talk to people because I just can't take, you know, the judgment. And it's just too much for me and it's something I really struggle with. 

00:21:10
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So you feel like people are judging you, perhaps even me, right now? 

00:21:15
COLIN I feel like everyone is always judging. I just, I just, when I think of people that's, that's what I think of. I, I don't get how people can have girlfriends and have friends, because it's just, it's just like, always selfconscious and sometimes painful to be with other people for me. 

00:21:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Hmm. Do you have a wider family, outside of you and your mom? 

00:21:40
COLIN I do. Um, I have some really crazy uncles and aunts in Virginia and all I know is they live in a trailer and do a lot of drugs. So I, I don't talk to them a lot, but they sent me, like, they send me like, $10 checks for my birthday, so they're not a big part of my life, though. 

00:22:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Hmm. So is it just you and your mom at home? 

00:22:05
COLIN I also have a little sister, um, and she's actually like this big star at school, she's really well-loved and, um, I always, uh, see her with her friends and I just, I, I start sweating almost, 'cause I can't imagine myself in a, in a group of people. I would just break out or something. 

00:22:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Hmm. So, throughout your life it's been like this, even in elementary school? 

00:22:40
COLIN (crosstalk)No. No, no, no. No, I was, I was really a happy, normal kid when I was little. I, um, I remember Halloween and always dressing up as a different Power Ranger and going with my friend Robbie, who, who is still my friend, but I didn't, I wasn't afraid of people when I was little. I just, hit me when I, probably like 13 or something. I, it's just, na-, it's really hard. 

00:23:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD It hit you. Were there a series of events, or was there an event that, uh, you remember that was particularly difficult? 

00:23:20
COLIN Well, my, my dad, he's not with us anymore, but when I was around 13 he had these parties where he invited over friends, and, uh, it was for his work - I barely remember what he did, something electrical engineering, computer chips, I don't know - but, uh, he, he invited all of his friends over to our house, and I just remember sitting on the staircase and watching them and these men with these bellowing laughs, and just, you know, they brought freaky sushi foods, and it was just scary to me. I didn't want to talk to any of them, but when I did they, they asked me what I, what I liked to do, what, and, and actually, one of the main reasons I came here is because my mom really is frustrated with - oh gosh - with, um, how I'm doing with social things, and, and she wants to throw me a party, and I, I can't believe that she wants to do this. It's like I feel kind of betrayed, but I don't know. 

00:24:50
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And that party kind of seems sort of like that big party that your dad had, a, a few years ago when, when you felt like everybody was looking at you and asking you about yourself and, and all that? 

00:25:05
COLIN Yeah. 

00:25:05
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Ah. So, after that party that your dad had, um, what happened? How did you, did you start shutting down socially and everything? You were this happy kid beforehand. 

00:25:15
COLIN I mean I used to laugh, but whenever I heard laughs it just reminded me of that party. 

00:25:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Uh huh. 

00:25:20
COLIN And, just, people aren't the same as they used to be when I was little. People are huge, and ominous, and just, people's eyes. I just, I can't make eye contact. It's just like they're waiting for something, waiting for me to make a joke or... 

00:25:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So what have you been doing since that party, uh, that your dad had, uh, when you're around social, uh, situations? How do you generally deal with these social situations? How to you take care of yourself? 

00:26:00
COLIN Well, you said, "What have I been doing?" I, I've been sitting in my room, reading comic books is what I like to do. Um, I guess, something, I relate to the super-heroes somehow. I guess I would like to be able to run around in a cape. That's probably something I like about comic books, but... 

00:26:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD How about at school? 

00:26:25
COLIN At school it's, it's, it's tough. It's, I mean, I can't even, I, I'm scared to bring a certain type of backpack if it's the wrong kind of backpack, if it, if it's the wrong color. I'm just, and then, sometimes when my eyes wander and I catch eye contact with people, it's like I break a sweat almost, it's, it's really. I mean I love teachers. I really love having someone to look up to and just, that I can listen to. I'm a, I'm a good listener because I, I don't have to be the one doing something big. You know? 

00:27:05
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Hmm. So you, you said that you hate eye contact, and h-, have you been trying to avoid eye contact with, with the kids at school and...other than the teachers. It sounds like you feel comfortable with the teachers. 

00:27:20
COLIN Yeah, th-, that's true. I, with kids it's just, I just think of them as, like, evil or scary. It's just not for me. So, I'm, this party that my mom wants to have, I, I can't imagine being able to talk to anyone, let alone look at them, so... 

00:27:50
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And you're talking to me very nicely right now. I r-, really appreciate that. 

00:27:50
COLIN Sure. 

00:27:50
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Is, is it difficult to talk to me right now? 

00:27:55
COLIN Well, it was difficult driving here and walking through the door. That was one of the scariest things I've ever done. But now that I'm here I guess it's kind of safe, so, yeah. 

00:28:10
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Great. So it's more about the anticipatory anxiety. It's about everything leading up to the big event. 

00:28:20
COLIN Yeah, but, I don't think it'll be that way two weeks from now. 

00:28:25
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD (crosstalk)At the party. 

00:28:25
COLIN When i-, I turn 16 and...God. 

00:28:30
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Ah. In the description of this earlier party, uh, where you were right along, you were doing really well, you were this happy-go-lucky kid, and then your dad had this big party, and everything just sort of shut down. 

00:28:45
COLIN Yeah. 

00:28:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So, so you kind of think that something happened to you then, and that you became this other person, so to speak. 

00:28:55
COLIN (crosstalk)Yeah. I mean my dad is, I think, a big reason why I have the...It's social phobia. I hate calling it that 'cause, uh, it's so scientific and makes me sound like a stupid, some-, uh, like I'm afflicted with something. But my dad, he, he brought these people, and so, and then he left. He just left me kind of with these feelings of, of fear and...So, it's just, I don't know why I changed, but I did, and it's kind of irreversible, from what I can tell. 

00:29:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD But it's still you. You were that k-, same, you're that same kid that was, uh, this happy-go-lucky kid - deep inside of you, let's say - and we want to recapture that part of you. Right? And somehow you kind of shifted after that party, and I wonder if we can kind of get a sense of how that shift occurred and how we can shift back to that older you, that happy-go-lucky you. 

00:30:00
COLIN Yeah, that would be great. 

00:30:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD I wonder if we could even describe it in terms of something that happened in your brain that you began to kind of feed after a period of time. So there's this area of the brain that you can call "Amy", but technically it's called the "amygdala". It's kind of like the panic button. 

00:30:20
COLIN (crosstalk)OK. 

00:30:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And this, uh, amygdala, or "Amy", I think it's more useful to call it "Amy" because "taming Amy", uh, sounds a whole lot easier than taming this amygdala, whoa, it sounds kind of complicated. 

00:30:35
COLIN (crosstalk)OK. 

00:30:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And you know what happens with, with Amy is the more you feed Amy by avoiding things that make you a little anxious, Amy gets incredibly hungry for other things that might turn it on. And so since that party that your dad had, uh, it sounds like you've been even avoiding eye contact with other kids and, and kind of hiding out in your room and, uh, spending a whole lot of time, uh, enjoying Power Rangers and, and other things, but less engaging with other people. Huh? 

00:31:15
COLIN Yeah. 

00:31:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. So Amy, boy, Amy is really out on the prowl for whatever might kick it off, and the, uh, the way to tame Amy is to actually do what Amy doesn't want you to do, we could say, and that is to do what you're doing right now with me. Because you had this anticipatory anxiety before coming, you know, you wonder, "Oh my God. Who is this guy?" and, "Am I going to be able to sit down and talk to him and, let alone look at him like you're looking at me right now, with even a smile on your face. I wonder if we can tame Amy in the same way, with a whole lot of other people, gradually, so that when you get to the party...What did you say, it's in two weeks? 

00:32:05
COLIN Yeah. 

00:32:05
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. So we have a, roughly about two weeks to kind of dampen down Amy a little bit, and 

00:32:10
COLIN (crosstalk)If I have this feeling that there's a, a timer, like I have two weeks, I, I'm not gonna be able to focus on it. That's how I feel. 

00:32:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD You mean it's like it's hanging out over there. But you did have this 10:00 in the morning to meet with this Dr. Arden guy, right? There was a timer there, wasn't there? 

00:32:30
COLIN Yeah. 

00:32:30
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. But you managed to do it. It's amazing. How did you do it? 

00:32:35
COLIN I dug deep, I, I really knew that I need to change, and I can't talk to my f-, I can't talk to friends. I can't talk to my friend Robbie because he barely understands what I'm talking about. And my mom just wants me to get rid of it. 

00:33:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Get rid of "it"? Meaning, ge-, the social phobia? 

00:33:05
COLIN Yeah. 

00:33:05
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Ah. And, wonder if we can kind of think of "it" as something that is sort of shed in time, rather than something you're just gonna click on like a lightswitch and all of a sudden, "Gah. Let's get rid of that." Uh, get rid of the darkness. Uh, but maybe something that you're gonna, uh, get rid of like a bad habit. 

00:33:25
COLIN OK. 

00:33:25
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD We could say that your social anxiety is really kind of like a bad habit, and, that just sort of grew, and grew, and grew the more you were avoided being around other, other kids, the more you developed this bad habit, of, uh, "God! I just hate these ki-, you know, being around them. I don't want to look at their eyes and everything." So you develop all of these ideas about how even looking at eyes, click on Amy, and in fact I, I think is really good that you've picked up on this eye thing because one, one thing that we do knno about people with social phobia is, uh, when they do look at eyes their amygdala lights up. And, um, but often times people with social phobia then look away. And so I wonder if we could even practice, keep on looking at my eyes, like you're doing. Every once in a while you look back at my eyes again, and I really appreciate that, and then we can develop a strategy as to what you c-, might be doing over the next, let's say, couple weeks, uh, so that by the time of your party you might be able to kind of ride through the party and get through it. You might have some anticipatory anxiety like you did before, seeing me. 

00:34:50
COLIN Do you really think that it'll be just be anticipatory and it, and it won't happen? 

00:34:55
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Well, how do you feel right now? 

00:35:00
COLIN I don't know. I just, I, I'm talking, so that, I guess that helps. Uh, and, but I guess you're not as scary as some of the kids in my school. I don't know. It's, um, uh, probably because I know you're not here to, like, make fun of me or, I mean, it's, it's scary that you're so intent on focusing on me and I, and I just get very self-conscious. But it's, it's kind of, there's a little bit more ease. 

00:35:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD But nevertheless, before seeing me you had, and, and I, I'm asking really, you had more anxiety before seeing me than right now. 

00:35:45
COLIN Yeah. Definitely. 

00:35:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD (crosstalk)Yeah. Right. And you mentioned, "Geez. But all the kids at the school, they're a little anxiety-provoking," but are you inviting all of the kids as the school to the party? That's a big party. 

00:36:00
COLIN (crosstalk)I, I haven't thought about it, barely. I mean, it's my mom's plan. She's trying, she, she thinks that by bringing all these people into my house that I'll just be, just like you s-, like, "Oh! It's wonderful that you came!" I just, I... 

00:36:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Mmm hmm. Do you have any control over who you're gonna to be inviting? 

00:36:25
COLIN Um, I'm sure I do. 

00:36:30
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Mmm hmm. So, there are some kids at school that are just s-, not exactly easy to get along with, I would imagine, and there are some kids that maybe jus-, just are kids, right? And, uh, then you can decide who you're gonna invite, and in fact, even though you're gonna invite a variety of kids, some kids might not even come, out of the invitations, right? So 

00:36:55
COLIN (crosstalk)Why would anyone come to my party? That's 

00:36:55
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD (crosstalk)Who knows? Kids like to come to parties. They get cake, and have activities, and, and all that. And a lot of times it has less to do with the kid whose party it is, uh, than the fact that it's a party. 

00:37:10
COLIN I guess so, but I doubt that anyone would want to come. I mean, people don't know me. People don't know my name. They just see me. I don't see them because I'm not looking, but... 

00:37:25
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So, is part of the fear, uh, inviting a bunch of kids and they don't show up? 

00:37:30
COLIN Definitely. I mean, if my mom's in charge of it she's probably just going to do "pin the tail on the donkey" and put out fruit. It's gonna be awful. 

00:37:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Put out fruit? 

00:37:45
COLIN Yeah. 

00:37:50
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Ah. Im, so, do you have any say in what kind of activities you're gonna, uh, potentially have, at this party? 

00:37:55
COLIN Well, the thing is she mentioned it to me. She sat me down. She said, "Colin, I know that things have to change for you and I want to see that, so I want to give you your sweet 16 party." And after that I just haven't been listening to this, what she's been saying about the party very clearly. You're asking about it, but I really don't know much about it; I don't want to think about it. It's just, I know that people are going to be invited by my mom and I'm gonna have to be there. And I, I can just picture myself on the top of the stairs, like at my dad's party, hearing laughing. Just... 

00:38:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So, you remember what we were talking about with avoidance earlier? How Amy really loves it when you avoid things that make you anxious? And so, as soon as your mother mentioned the party you started av-, avoid even hearing about the party anymore. And then it became looming large, "I don't know. Who knows what's going to happen. There might be 'pin the tail on the donkey', and fruit, and all that stuff," and you kind of went back to your room, so to speak, in your mind. 

00:39:20
COLIN Yeah. 

00:39:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And so the way to kind of tame Amy here is to at least begin to dialog with your mom about what the party's gonna to be like, what activities you might have, who you might even invite to the party. Because right now you have no sense of control. Right? 

00:39:40
COLIN I, I w-, another thing that I maybe could ask of you, why I came here, is like I don't think the party is a good idea. I think I could just, I could, I could take it slower. I really just, it's, it's terrifying. 

00:40:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Well, let's take the "take it slower" idea. And I, I think the "take it slower" idea i-, uh, sounds manageable, does it not? Because it means that you're going ahead in a direction instead of, uh, "No. I'm not having the party." I think it would be big mistake just to say, "No. I'm incapable of having any party." That's like what Amy wants. Right? And do you want Amy to runt he show here, or do you want this higher you to kind of run the show where you don't have to be plagued by this incredible fear of other people? 

00:40:40
COLIN Yeah. 

00:40:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So we want to kind of help you learn how to have control over your own life. And so taking it slow's a great, uh, way to be thinking about it. 

00:40:55
COLIN Yeah. I think that would be a lot better. 

00:41:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD OK. So, first thing in taking it slow is to talk to your mom about, "OK. You got this idea of this party." It's a concept. It isn't a definition for what all parties look like, but it's a concept, and that concept has got to be something that you and she work on defining together. Right? 

00:41:25
COLIN Yeah. 

00:41:25
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD And so, by having that dialog, and then you construct what the party's going to be, who's gonna potentially be there, what might occur, uh, but we know that there is a time, because you're only going to be turning 16 once. Right? You can't have it when you're 21. 

00:41:45
COLIN Yeah. 

00:41:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Right. Uh, and we can say that it's an opportunity to kind of structure in, because, frankly, to rewire your brain so that Amy has less control over your life like this, you're gonna have to do some things that you don't feel like doing. And, and this is, this is what you don't feel like doing, and that is to have a party. 

00:42:15
COLIN I mean, I do really love the idea of a party, just like I loved the idea of having someone like you to help me, but I, I guess if we keep working and talking about this Amy and stuff, that I could potentially, I could do it. Maybe. 

00:42:40
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Great. L-, listen to what you said, "I love the idea of having a party." Wow. That's a major statement, isn't it? 

00:42:50
COLIN Yeah. I love the idea of being in, you know, Carnegie Hall playing piano. I, I play piano. 

00:43:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Mmm hmm. 

00:43:00
COLIN But, I could never do it. 

00:43:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Uh huh. Well, neither could I. Well, I couldn't play the piano anyway, but, I mean, being Carnegie Hall and have all those people looking at me while I'm trying to play an instrument. God, that'd a-, that almost gives me a panic attack thinking about it. 

00:43:15
COLIN Yeah. 

00:43:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. But wh-, all we're talking about is having this party that you're, you and your mom are gonna come up with a model. And that model is gonna be something that hopefully goes along with what the idea of a party that you have in your mind. 

00:43:35
COLIN You know, what I've been thinking is that this is my mom's idea and she's gonna run the whole show, and she's kind of, you know, against me in this, but really, she is my mom after all, and she's not trying to scare me or...So, I guess, I guess I, I can talk more about it. If I really, if I really believe that I, in two weeks it can happen, then maybe I can actually talk to her about it instead of just ignoring her. You know? 

00:44:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Good. Good. And I wonder, too, in preparation for the party, that has yet to be defined because you're going to be talking to your mom about it, that you can begin to have little practice little parties, so to speak, meaning that, uh, uh, there are dress rehearsals, uh, meaning, in effect, little social, kind of, put your toe in the water a little bit, just so that by the time the party occurs, and we, again, don't know what the party is going to be looking like yet, because that, yet, is yet to be negotiated, uh, that by the time it's there it's not like you're going to be jumping from the high dive into the deep water of the pool and not knowing how to swim. 

00:45:00
COLIN OK. 

00:45:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So it's going to be, slowly you're going to be stepping into the water and then you're gonna go in the shallow end, and you're gonna wiggle your feet around, and, and everything else. 

00:45:10
COLIN (crosstalk)So it'll be, so it'll be a party with me and my mom first, and then she'll invite a friend? 

00:45:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. And then you add in another person and another person, and th-, hey, who knows, maybe, uh, people that live next door, and they're just coming over to share a lunch or something like that, or... 

00:45:30
COLIN That's not what people do. That doesn't make sense. I, I don't want 

00:45:30
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD (crosstalk)Now that people do? 

00:45:35
COLIN That's the kind of thing that people with social phobia do to break out of it. It doesn't, it's not a normal thing. I can't invite people over to something that, that there's no occasion for. 

00:45:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Well, remember that nobody has to say, or you don't even have to say, with your mom, that this is a dress rehearsal, but really what they are is just little social events. Your mom might even invite the next door neighbor to come over and, "Hey, come on. I want to show you something that..." and you're just happen to be there, with her, having lunch, as your mom talks about, you know, the remodeling idea that she might be having with the, the den or something like that, and you're, you're just sharing a lunch there. And your job is just to kind of practice being there with other people, and gradually that's sort of building up and building up, so that by the time the party arrives you're just, kind of, easing on in. 

00:46:30
COLIN Like thinking about it as just me with people, rather than a party where people are expecting fun and... 

00:46:40
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Won-, wonderful way to describe it. Wonderful. 'Cause ev-, even the name "party" sounds a bit, "Boom! Party!" 

00:46:50
COLIN Definitely. 

00:46:50
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Yeah. That's a good way to describe it. 

00:46:55
COLIN There is this super-nice lady named Rosetta who lives across the street, and she, she has this big garden in her back yard and she always brings us, you know, flowers and vegetables. She's this really, I think she's Ukrainian or something, but I guess we could in-, invite her over for dinner and... 

00:47:15
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Great idea. Wonderful idea. But see, you're already starting to think about ways of taming Amy slowly, and Rosetta's her name? 

00:47:30
COLIN Mmm hmm. 

00:47:30
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Uh huh. And she might even be really pleased to bring some tomatoes or something, for a nice tomato salad. 

00:47:35
COLIN You know, I really do not talk like this a lot, but I'm desperate. I really want to get to Carnegie Hall, and it's taken so, it's been so many years of pulling at my jeans, and looking away from people, and sweating. It's just, how, how many years can I be anxious until I pop? 

00:48:00
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Hmm. So, let's take that Carnegie Hall kind of concept. Do you think that the people at, uh, that give, uh, let's say a solo concert at Carnegie Hall, don't give smaller concerts before they give that Carnegie Hall concert? 

00:48:15
COLIN I guess you're right. 

00:48:20
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Don't they start with little, uh, kind of, demonstrations, maybe even in a living room, and then, and then more people come in, and now they're playing in front of maybe five people, and then they build up, and build up. Boy, going straight, straight to Carnegie Hall. 

00:48:35
COLIN (crosstalk)Yeah. I've thought of that. 

00:48:35
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Whoa. My God. That's a, that's pra-, really intense. A-, that's like whiplash, psychological whiplash. Right? 

00:48:45
COLIN OK. Yeah. 

00:48:45
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD So, if you wanna get to that level, then you've got to do a lot of little concerts, and in fact, do you know, you might even, uh, uh, play a little piece for Rosetta, when she comes. She might get a kick out of it. 

00:49:00
COLIN (crosstalk)I don't know if she's gonna like it. 

00:49:05
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD Wh-, sh-, who knows? 

00:49:05
COLIN (crosstalk)She probably wouldn't. 

00:49:10
JOHN B. ARDEN, PHD You don't know, do you? 

00:49:10
COLIN You know, maybe this is my first step on, towards, you know, Carnegie Hall. The party. This is something that I've wanted to do, and I'm finally sitting here, and feels pretty good to have made the step and...So, the next step is, you know, playing in a little cafe, you know, inviting, uh, Rosetta over.
