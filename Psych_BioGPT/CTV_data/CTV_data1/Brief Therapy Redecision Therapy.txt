A Conference

Brief Therapy- Redecision Model 

00:00:35
Mary Goulding, M.S.W. 

00:00:50
MARY GOULDING You wanna introduce yourself? 

00:00:50
KEVIN WARD I'm Kevin Ward. I'm from British Columbia and I have, a...(crosstalk) I'm Kevin Ward. I'm in private practice in British Columbia. Is that better? (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:01:00
MARY GOULDING Okay, so, what is it that you want to change about yourself today? 

00:01:05
KEVIN WARD I want to...there's something stopping me from making, when I, when I see a, uh, something in a client that I wanna comment on or make a decision on, if it's too severe I really hesitate 'til it's past the moment of opportunity, and I, it's like I, I make a, I make a decision based on as if it's life and death and, I, I don't know why. 

00:01:30
MARY GOULDING Okay. Uh, give a specific patient, a specific scene. A specific thing you wanna say. 

00:01:35
KEVIN WARD Uh. Um, it, it just happens so often, I, I'm like...(crosstalk) 

00:01:50
MARY GOULDING Well, I know. Make one. 

00:01:50
KEVIN WARD Um. Okay, uh, uh, um, mother and child, uh, teenage boy, um, the comes in, and, and, um is so distraught, and, and, the son is, um... 

00:02:00
MARY GOULDING Uh, let's bring mother, huh? Just bring a chair over here. Okay, there's mother, now, if you're willing, be her first and what is it she says that you want to respond to? 

00:02:20
KEVIN WARD Uh, she says, "I don't know what to do with my son." 

00:02:20
MARY GOULDING Okay, so you can sit over there, say, "I don't (ph) want to know what to with my son." Huh. 

00:02:25
KEVIN WARD Sit over there? 

00:02:25
MARY GOULDING I hope it'll work. 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:35
MARY GOULDING Good, and sort of sit like her and be her. 

00:02:40
KEVIN WARD I just don't know what to do anymore. I, don-, I don't know what to say to him. He doesn't listen, he doesn't, he doesn't come home. I can't do anything anymore. 

00:02:50
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Go be you, and what is you want to say to her that you don't say>? 

00:03:00
KEVIN WARD Why haven't you spent time with him when he's asked? 

00:03:10
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm, and what do you say in your head to keep you from saying that? 

00:03:15
KEVIN WARD I say it's too threatening. It's too, um, uh, why questions cause defense, um, um... 

00:03:25
MARY GOULDING It's also a useless question. It's a feel guilty question. So maybe you were smart not to ask it. 

00:03:35
KEVIN WARD Um. What I, what I say is, um, uh, "How much time have you spent with him?" Because I get a sense that he's wanted her and, he's... 

00:03:50
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:03:50
KEVIN WARD he's wanted to spend time but she hasn't... 

00:03:50
MARY GOULDING Mm. 

00:03:50
KEVIN WARD ...and I'm wondering what's stopping them. 

00:03:55
MARY GOULDING And then what happens in your own head that you're upset about, you-, about what you said? 

00:04:00
KEVIN WARD Uh, why couldn't it have been, why couldn't I, do it, do it in one question rather, than, than five or six? 

00:04:05
HOS Mm. 

00:04:05
KEVIN WARD Uh, why is it take so long to, ask, ask what I wanna ask when I know, what, what I'm wanting to get out, what I'm wanting to hear cuz I can see it, (crosstalk)I can feel it, but I can't get it... 

00:04:15
MARY GOULDING Oh. 

00:04:20
KEVIN WARD I can't get it out in one question. 

00:04:20
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Oh yeah, and there she sits and you're busy with what you should have done, sort of like you're busy with what she should have done. 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:04:40
KEVIN WARD Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
MARY GOULDING Did you have that kind of a parent that was, talked, uh, talked about spilled milk instead of wiping it up? 

00:04:45
KEVIN WARD Um, um, I don't quite get that one. 

00:04:50
MARY GOULDING Some, some mothers talk and talk about, y-, the milk that spilled...(crosstalk) 

00:04:55
KEVIN WARD No, I don't think so. 

00:04:55
MARY GOULDING instead of just asking you to wipe it up. 

00:05:00
KEVIN WARD Uh, no, da-, I mean, dad said either do somethin' or get out of here. 

00:05:00
MARY GOULDING Uh. 

00:05:05
KEVIN WARD Um, if you're not going to do anything then you might as well go in the house. 

00:05:10
MARY GOULDING Hmm. Does that sound like the voice in your head? 

00:05:10
KEVIN WARD Yep. 

00:05:10
MARY GOULDING Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
KEVIN WARD Uh, and, and it's do it right. 

00:05:15
MARY GOULDING Oh, that's the problem... 

00:05:15
KEVIN WARD It's do it... 

00:05:15
MARY GOULDING It's do it and do it right. On a scale of one to ten, how easy was it to do it right by his standards? 

00:05:25
KEVIN WARD I, I don't think I did. Well, I did. Huh. It was hard. On a, ten, ten. 

00:05:35
MARY GOULDING Ten is hard. 

00:05:35
KEVIN WARD It was hard. It was as hard as anything. 

00:05:40
MARY GOULDING I can believe it. Was he a therapist? 

00:05:40
KEVIN WARD No. 

00:05:40
MARY GOULDING What did he do? 

00:05:45
KEVIN WARD Uh, uh, he did weddings in Reno. 

00:05:45
MARY GOULDING Did what? 

00:05:45
KEVIN WARD He did weddings. 

00:05:50
MARY GOULDING At...Not a minister? 

00:05:50
KEVIN WARD Uh, part time, part time not. 

00:05:55
MARY GOULDING Uh-huh. I, I've got a really good hunch of what would help your therapy a lot. Each time you start in your head about what you should do or how you're not doing it right, stand up, client there or not, okay? Walk to your door, open it, and send him out. He hasn't your skill... 

00:06:15
KEVIN WARD No. 

00:06:20
MARY GOULDING ...so why listen to him? 

00:06:20
KEVIN WARD I don't know. 

00:06:25
MARY GOULDING I don't either. 

00:06:25
KEVIN WARD Uh, uh. 

00:06:30
MARY GOULDING That was a why question too and it was a dumb one. Your father didn't catch that one. 

00:06:40
[sil.] 

00:06:45
MARY GOULDING Where are ya? 

00:06:45
KEVIN WARD I'm, I, I, I'm on a scene that he did with me. 

00:06:50
MARY GOULDING 'Kay, wanna go to that? (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
KEVIN WARD Yeah, I'd like to. 

00:06:50
MARY GOULDING Let's excuse the woman for now... 

00:06:55
KEVIN WARD 'Kay. 

00:06:55
MARY GOULDING ...and wipe off the chair and put him there. 

00:07:00
[sil.] 

00:07:05
MARY GOULDING That's the way. 

00:07:10
KEVIN WARD Um, talk to him? 

00:07:10
MARY GOULDING Well first, tell, uh, I'd like to know how (crosstalk)old are ya? 

00:07:15
KEVIN WARD It was just...I'm, s-, seven, (crosstalk)roughly seven... 

00:07:15
MARY GOULDING Okay. 

00:07:15
KEVIN WARD ...and I'm, uh, practicing for a, uh, quick draw, I do, uh, revolver, quick draw, shooting. 

00:07:25
MARY GOULDING Real bullets? 

00:07:25
KEVIN WARD Yeah. We-, ah-, it's with real ammunition, it, it's potent for 50 yards or so... 

00:07:30
MARY GOULDING Hmm. 

00:07:35
KEVIN WARD ...and then it disintegrates, but, uh, anyway, he was, he's loading these loads, uh, he's taking a 22 and reloading it with something and to test it out he needed to know, because we were working on stage, and in coliseum in Reno, and, um, it had to disintegrate in 25 yards rather than 50, and, um, he wanted to test it out so he tested it on the... 

00:08:00
MARY GOULDING Uh, be there okay? Where are you where you're testing? 

00:08:00
KEVIN WARD I'm standing on the sidewalk. 

00:08:00
MARY GOULDING Okay, you're testing on the sidewalk of Reno. 

00:08:05
KEVIN WARD And, um... 

00:08:05
MARY GOULDING Hmm. 

00:08:05
KEVIN WARD Uh, it's in a, it's in our backyard. 

00:08:10
MARY GOULDING Oh, okay. You... 

00:08:10
KEVIN WARD We have about an acre. Um, and, uh, I'm standing on the sidewalk, and, and the, we have a couple of horses out there so first of all, I, I, um, he tells me to shoot the rear end of the horse. Uh, it's 25 yards out there so it's not supposed to hurt them, and so I shot and, yeah, nothing happened. They didn't flinch or anything, didn't move, and he said, there's only, another, one way to test it, he says, "I need to get out there and you need to shoot me in the back." And, um, um, he put on a, he-... 

00:08:45
MARY GOULDING He's putting on? 

00:08:45
KEVIN WARD He, he put on a heavy coat, uh, buckskin, uh, leather, and, um, uh, I didn't wanna shoot him... 

00:09:00
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:09:00
KEVIN WARD ...but, uh, anyway, I shot, and, and he didn't flinch too much or anything, and, um, um, I said, "Was it okay?" And he says, "Well, I, I need to do some work on it." And, um, I, I, don't remember what happened after that or if, I don't...(ph)I thought it was okay, I think, and, uh, then I saw later that it had caused a big welt in the middle of his back... 

00:09:25
MARY GOULDING Hmm. 

00:09:25
KEVIN WARD ...and, uh... 

00:09:25
MARY GOULDING And you look very sad. 

00:09:30
KEVIN WARD I don't like hurting people. 

00:09:35
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Say that again. 

00:09:35
KEVIN WARD I don't like hurting people. 

00:09:35
MARY GOULDING Good. 

00:09:40
[sil.] 

00:09:40
KEVIN WARD Uh. 

00:09:45
MARY GOULDING So you know your sadness with that. 

00:09:45
KEVIN WARD I know. 

00:09:50
MARY GOULDING Do you know your anger? 

00:09:50
KEVIN WARD Not as much. Not as much, I've, gone...I've used sadness and tears throughout, uh, anytime it comes up. Um, there's only one or two times that I've worked with the anger part. 

00:10:05
MARY GOULDING Mm. How'd that go? 

00:10:05
KEVIN WARD Oh it went great. It felt good. 

00:10:10
MARY GOULDING Okay, so you have gotten in touch with your anger at him in this scene or (crosstalk)other scenes? 

00:10:15
KEVIN In this, mainly in this. This seems to come anytime, I don't know what it is, and even if I'm working with a therapist or not this scene is what comes up. 

00:10:25
MARY GOULDING I know it feels like it comes up and it's hard to believe it but you bring it up. 

00:10:30
KEVIN WARD Huh. That I, I, I can see that, I can...that makes sense. 

00:10:35
MARY GOULDING Yeah. So, so, say that and see if you can finish, "I bring this up because..." 

00:10:45
KEVIN WARD I bring this up because it's a place of familiarity, lack of other word, uh, it's a place, that I, that I think I know what all the circumstances were. 

00:10:55
MARY GOULDING No, there are a couple of things you're not knowing. 

00:11:00
KEVIN WARD I... 

00:11:00
MARY GOULDING On of 'em is that you didn't hurt him. Ya know, what's a welt? 

00:11:05
KEVIN WARD Yeah, I don't know how much I hurt him. 

00:11:10
MARY GOULDING You, you didn't hurt him. You caused a welt. You didn't sever his spinal cord... 

00:11:15
KEVIN WARD No, no, I... 

00:11:15
MARY GOULDING In your, in your head what you did was pretty terrible. 

00:11:20
KEVIN WARD Yeah. 

00:11:25
MARY GOULDING Would you tell it from the position that (crosstalk)nothing much happened? 

00:11:25
KEVIN WARD (crosstalk)I've never heard that. I've never heard that before. 

00:11:30
MARY GOULDING Yeah. That's what I meant, you don't know (crosstalk)all of it. 

00:11:30
KEVIN WARD (crosstalk)That I, that I didn't, hur-, hurt him. 

00:11:30
MARY GOULDING Yeah. So, tell the story again and acknowledge that nothing much happened. 

00:11:45
[sil.] 

00:11:50
KEVIN WARD I, um, was practicing and he wanted me to shoot the horses. I shot them. He went out there and he asked me to shoot him so he could see how much work he needed to do on it, I shot, that's amazing. 

00:12:05
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:12:10
KEVIN WARD I shot him in the back and it caused a welt. 

00:12:10
MARY GOULDING Period. 

00:12:15
KEVIN WARD Period. 

00:12:20
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now look at this woman. 

00:12:25
KEVIN WARD Why couldn't I see that fact? 

00:12:25
MARY GOULDING At worst, you'll cause a welt if you ask her why the hell she didn't spend more time with her kid. 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
KEVIN WARD Okay. It's having fun with it that I've not been doing. 

00:12:40
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah. Yeah? Wha-, whadya wanna say? 

00:12:50
KEVIN WARD I think that's about it. 

00:12:55
MARY GOULDING Okay. Nice work hey. (ph) 

00:13:05
[sil.] 

00:13:10
MARY GOULDING Hold questions 'til the end. There's one other person who said they wanted to work, and if Bob were here, you would hear him booming, "Wants to change, not work." Cuz you can work and work and work and not change. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:35
MARY GOULDING Hi. When we talked earlier you said something about you're meeting your son (crosstalk)and you want it to go well. 

00:13:45
DAVE That's right. I'm flying from here to where my son lives, and, uh, I wanna be able to be with him in a way he wants and a way that allows us to relate and there's just been lots of, uh, lots of problems in our relationship and I want... 

00:14:05
MARY GOULDING What's your first name? 

00:14:05
DAVE Dave. 

00:14:05
MARY GOULDING Dave, and you can give your last name and who you are if you want to don't have to. 

00:14:10
DAVE U, I guess I won't for...an-...these are, I'm not quite sure... 

00:14:15
MARY GOULDING Okay. 

00:14:15
DAVE ...the use of these and I don't know ... 

00:14:15
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:14:15
DAVE ...if he'd be comfortable with it, so. 

00:14:20
MARY GOULDING Yeah. I think they sell them so you can't have any control of the use whatsoever. 

00:14:20
DAVE Yeah. That's all right. (ph)Uh-huh. 

00:14:25
MARY GOULDING Oh, okay. So, Dave, your son is? 

00:14:30
DAVE He's 25. Is that what you mean? 

00:14:30
MARY GOULDING Mm, yeah, and, uh, (crosstalk)what are your, what's the worst scenario that you're thinkin' of? 

00:14:40
DAVE Well, it's not, we've had a long time where, uh, he won't, he doesn't talk about anything significant. He's not sure he wants to be with me or talk with me. He's, it's improving in that he thanks me for things, which is new for him. 

00:14:55
MARY GOULDING Is this a result of a divorce? 

00:15:00
DAVE No, no, um, he, ha-, he's always had a better relationship with his mother, my wife. Uh, he was, uh, adopted hyper-active kid, difficult to raise, and I was a, uh, American male in many ways. Uh, nurturing in lots of ways other fathers aren't but I, uh, also had my power trips. 

00:15:25
MARY GOULDING Okay, so, so, you're still feeling some guilt about past. 

00:15:30
DAVE Yes, but I, uh... 

00:15:30
MARY GOULDING So what could you two do to have fun when you arrive? You're gonna pretend you're not a therapist. 

00:15:35
DAVE Right. Uh, well, I was wishing he were here because if he were here we would've...he used to love Boy George and Boy George is in town and, it would've, that would've been a fun thing to do together, and he's... 

00:16:00
MARY GOULDING You could've. 

00:16:00
DAVE I think. 

00:16:00
MARY GOULDING Yeah, yeah. I'm just laughing because I hadn't hear of Boy George in years. 

00:16:05
DAVE Oh, he, he just wrote an autobiography and he's (crosstalk)having some kind of comeback I'm told... 

00:16:10
MARY GOULDING Oh my goodness. 

00:16:10
DAVE I don't know his music when I hear it, but, uh... 

00:16:10
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Okay, so he's not here and you can't do that... 

00:16:15
DAVE Well, and I'll ask Eric if there's something he wants to do and once in a while he'll have a movie in mind... 

00:16:20
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:16:20
DAVE ...so we can do that but, it, again, it tends to be things where there's very little room for interaction. 

00:16:30
MARY GOULDING And what kind of things do you like to do? 

00:16:35
DAVE Be a therapist. 

00:16:35
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Oh, ya know, it's hard enough to be a kid without having a father who's a therapist, or mother. 

00:16:40
DAVE No, um, I like to dance. I like to go to, uh, symphonic music. I love modern dance, uh, and so I like to go to those kind of performances... 

00:16:55
MARY GOULDING And is the place you're going a place that would have that? 

00:17:00
DAVE Not according, I doubt it. It's Phoenix and he's used to living in Chicago. 

00:17:05
MARY GOULDING Yeah, well Phoenix probably has some things... 

00:17:10
AUDIENCE MEMBER Phoenix has come a long way. 

00:17:10
MARY GOULDING Yeah. They say that Phoenix has come a long way. Okay, so what would you like to do with him? 

00:17:20
DAVE Uh, I'd like to, I'd like to do something where there's not pressure to sit face to face, but we, but we could talk if he feels like it... 

00:17:30
MARY GOULDING Mm. 

00:17:30
DAVE ...I mean, my idea would be like hiking in the dessert park, or, or hiking on (crosstalk)a trail or... 

00:17:35
MARY GOULDING Okay, let's pretend he's here... 

00:17:40
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:17:40
MARY GOULDING ...or better yet, you're there. 

00:17:45
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:17:45
MARY GOULDING Okay, and you say to him, "If I had my choice..." However you say it, "I'd like to hike in the dessert park." 

00:17:50
DAVE Oh, okay. 

00:17:50
MARY GOULDING Have you seen the dessert park? 

00:17:50
DAVE Years and years ago. 

00:17:50
MARY GOULDING Okay, that's a good choice then. 

00:17:55
DAVE Okay. Um, if I had my choice, I'd like to go hiking with you. Maybe in the desert park or somewhere out in nature. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:18:15
DAVE Um, whatever. 

00:18:20
MARY GOULDING Okay, now you can diagnose, what's , whatever or say "Okay, let's go." What are you thinking? 

00:18:35
DAVE I'm double thinking. I'm thinking what will he say if I say, "Okay, let's go." Okay. 

00:18:40
MARY GOULDING Try it. 

00:18:40
DAVE Okay, let's go. Uh... Well, I can't go for very long tomorrow, uh, uh, cuz I gotta be to work by, uh, three o'clock and I don't wanna get up early. 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:15
DAVE Well, what time are you willing to get up? Oh, are you takin' me out for breakfast? 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:35
DAVE Sure. 

00:19:35
MARY GOULDING Okay, now you've got a nice activity. He likes you to take him to breakfast and you can have fun. Okay, now, sure, now how do you respond? 

00:19:45
DAVE Okay, uh, pick me up at 10:00, 10:30. Okay. I'll be there at, uh, at 10:15, and, uh... 

00:20:00
MARY GOULDING Oh, oh, oh. In other words, he's not gonna be, he's gonna be very wishy washy on time and you're going to be there at an exact time in order to be disappointed. Would you be willing to be there...Okay, I'll be there around then. 

00:20:20
DAVE Okay. 

00:20:20
MARY GOULDING Just like he is. 

00:20:25
DAVE Mm-hmm. Fine. Oh, okay, I'll be around there around 10:00, 10:30, um... 

00:20:30
MARY GOULDING Exactly. 

00:20:30
DAVE ...and I'll be dressed for hiking. 

00:20:40
MARY GOULDING Whadya think? 

00:20:40
DAVE Uh. 

00:20:40
MARY GOULDING The audience thinks that's, a, that's not (crosstalk)too cool. 

00:20:45
DAVE Uh-huh. Uh. 

00:20:55
MARY GOULDING How long are you going to be there? 

00:20:55
DAVE Uh, only one, I'll get there in an evening, uh, uh, that is, I, I, can get to where I can see him. I have a business appointment first. I, I have from evening, uh, Tuesday 'til, my plane goes out Thursday around two or three in the afternoon. 

00:21:15
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Then if something, quote, happens... 

00:21:20
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:21:20
MARY GOULDING ...things don't happen, but... 

00:21:20
DAVE Yeah. 

00:21:20
MARY GOULDING ...if something, quote, happens that you don't get to do the hike with him you can either do it after he goes to work or the following morning huh? 

00:21:30
DAVE Oh yes. 

00:21:30
MARY GOULDING So you don't have to be disappointed in not hiking if he sets it up so that you don't hike and you'll be disappointed. You'll have to, you can fool him, and not be disappointed. 

00:21:45
DAVE Around the hike, yes. Clearly, I can, I cannot be disappointed about the hike. 

00:21:50
MARY GOULDING Okay, so what are you, p-, what are you... 

00:21:50
DAVE Planning on being disappointed about? 

00:21:55
MARY GOULDING Exactly. You got it. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:05
DAVE Well, I, I have a nephew in this city and I had this wonderful surprise of great contact with a nephew I've never had that good contact with. So, I want a surprise... 

00:22:20
MARY GOULDING I hear what you want. 

00:22:20
DAVE ...of good contact. Uh, i-, i- no, and so I guess I'm planning to be disappointed around the level of contact. 

00:22:25
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. So you won in one encounter, W-O-N in one encounter. Willing to let this one just be easy? 

00:22:35
DAVE Uh-huh. Oh, I, I'm sorry, yo-, I won in the encounter... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
MARY GOULDING With your nephew. 

00:22:40
DAVE ...with my nephew so I don't have to win this one. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
MARY GOULDING Yeah... 

00:22:45
DAVE Okay. 

00:22:45
MARY GOULDING ...or you can declare it a winner. 

00:22:45
DAVE I've already won. Uh-huh. It sounds easy.... 

00:22:55
MARY GOULDING Oh I know it isn't....(crosstalk) 

00:22:55
DAVE I'm not quite... 

00:22:55
MARY GOULDING ... I really do know it isn't. 

00:23:00
DAVE Uh-huh. I'm, I, I do the other side too. You see, I, I, um, sometimes I want it so much that I try too hard and other times I'm so convinced it can't happen that I don't initiate anything... 

00:23:15
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:23:15
DAVE ...so I go in those two polarities... 

00:23:15
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:23:15
DAVE ...and it's hard to find the middle. 

00:23:20
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Are you willing to do what you just did here which is initiate but not... 

00:23:25
DAVE But not script the whole thing...(crosstalk) 

00:23:25
MARY GOULDING No-, Yeah, and not to, set it, set it up if he doesn't do it that way I'm disappointed. 

00:23:30
DAVE Yes, I'm... 

00:23:30
MARY GOULDING Cuz it is complicated. 

00:23:30
DAVE Yeah. I'm willing to initiate and, uh, and not declare how I'll dress. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:45
MARY GOULDING Yeah, cuz that might not work. 

00:23:45
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
MARY GOULDING Okay. What else do you wanna, s-, say to him? 

00:23:55
DAVE I want to say I have tried to say that I'm sorry for the ways I was with him, uh, that were bad for him but, I, (crosstalk)yeah, but I, ca-, I don't think he can hear that yet. 

00:24:15
MARY GOULDING Ya know what? I finally told my mother that I didn't turn out so bad so she could quit apologizing. 

00:24:20
DAVE Uh-huh. Yeah, and, I, the, the most, the newest thing I wanted to say to him was, uh, I hope you're clear that I'm not disappointed in you. I'm disappointed in my fathering, but I think he's turning out pretty damn good...(crosstalk) 

00:24:40
MARY GOULDING So how can you tell him that without bringing all this garbage from the past? 

00:24:50
DAVE Well I have in one way, that I've let him know I'm real pleased with the way he's handling his, uh, ya know, uh, he's in his first time long way from home and his first time having to lose a job and find a new one in a difficult economy and so on and I've let him know I'm really proud of the way he's handling that, and he is turning to us. He talks to my wife but he knows we both have input and that, uh, when he's had some difficult times lately he calls. 

00:25:20
MARY GOULDING Sounds good. 

00:25:25
DAVE Yeah. So he's reconnecting and he's... 

00:25:25
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:25:25
DAVE Um... so I can let him know of those things I'm happy about. 

00:25:35
MARY GOULDING How's the rest of your life? 

00:25:40
DAVE Pretty good but I work too hard, but no, the, actually, it, lots of it's very good and I've got a chance to stop working hardly at all in a few more years, so... 

00:25:50
MARY GOULDING Wow. 

00:25:50
DAVE Yeah. 

00:25:50
MARY GOULDING Okay, so you're liking your life? 

00:25:55
DAVE Oh yeah. (crosstalk)I'll do a lot more hiking in a few more years. 

00:26:00
MARY GOULDING Okay. Okay, so, what else do you need to do to hang loose here? 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:15
DAVE Get my grandmother out of the road. 

00:26:15
MARY GOULDING Okay. 

00:26:15
DAVE I think, incidentally, not incidentally, that, that's partly why I was attracted to working with you, cuz you look somewhat like how I remember her. 

00:26:25
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm, and she was a pain? 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:35
DAVE More than that. I wrote a, uh, a semi-fiction piece lately and it's the first thing I've published that's not academic. Well, I've published some poetry, uh, and then felt guilty because it describes her as an absolute judgmental woman. I think that's what she was. I only know that piece of her. 

00:27:00
MARY GOULDING Were you sort of thinking I would pass judgment? 

00:27:00
DAVE No... 

00:27:05
MARY GOULDING Oh. Pity. 

00:27:05
DAVE ...(crosstalk)I, I, I'd watched you. No, I knew you would be direct and quick and responding which she would've been and that's part of what it, made, made it more... 

00:27:15
MARY GOULDING Yeah 

00:27:20
DAVE ...(crosstalk)connected to her. 

00:27:20
MARY GOULDING Okay. Is there anything we need to do about you and grandmother and me? 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:30
DAVE Brief therapy, I'm not sure. I wish, I wish I could, uh, could find the warm part of my grandmother. I believed as a child all the way up 'til I was in college that I loved her and it's only been in the last, uh, I don't know, ten years or so that I've realized how much I hated her. 

00:28:00
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm, and possibly where you did both. 

00:28:00
DAVE Possibly, and I can't seem to find clear...I have clear memories of where she was emotionally abusive and I haven't been able to resurrect a clear memory (crosstalk)of when she wasn't. 

00:28:15
MARY GOULDING Okay. So this is another piece for the future? 

00:28:20
DAVE Yeah. (crosstalk)that's okay. (ph) 

00:28:20
MARY GOULDING Anything more with him? 

00:28:20
DAVE Well the connection, which I probably can't talk to him about is, that some of that judgmental criticism came through to him. That I inherited...(crosstalk) 

00:28:35
MARY GOULDING Yeah... 

00:28:35
DAVE ...from grandma. 

00:28:35
MARY GOULDING ...and he's not a therapist. 

00:28:35
DAVE No and he has never even met that grandmother, so...(crosstalk) 

00:28:40
MARY GOULDING Yeah, so why bother? 

00:28:40
DAVE ...he doesn't connect that. So, yeah. Uh-huh. Um...(crosstalk) 

00:28:45
MARY GOULDING So what's your...(crosstalk) 

00:28:45
DAVE So if I could, also, if grandma enters the room... 

00:28:50
MARY GOULDING In other words, there are some things that you're still secretly critical, about, about him? Is that what you're saying? 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
DAVE Yeah. I don't like it that he won't talk and he won't even tell me what his needs are. 

00:29:10
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Well, I tell you what, he's 25? 

00:29:10
DAVE Yes. Uh-huh. 

00:29:15
MARY GOULDING He probably doesn't have all that many needs. He may have some wants... 

00:29:20
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:29:20
MARY GOULDING ...and if you cross out need and ask him if there's something he wants from you he might...there's somewhat more chance he'd respond. 

00:29:30
DAVE Uh-huh. I'm more likely to ask what he wants but he will often answer, uh, uh, "ya know, I could use some more cash." 

00:29:40
MARY GOULDING Well good, he's honest. What's wrong with giving him some more cash? 

00:29:50
DAVE I do. 

00:29:50
MARY GOULDING Okay. That's what he wants. 

00:29:50
DAVE I don't believe...(ph)(crosstalk) 

00:29:50
MARY GOULDING I know what you want him to want. 

00:29:55
DAVE That's true. I don't mind giving him cash. 

00:30:00
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:30:00
DAVE I, real-, I just, uh, want more relationship than... 

00:30:05
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:30:05
DAVE ...that of course. 

00:30:05
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:30:05
DAVE Mm-hmm, but I'll get to know my nephew better too. 

00:30:10
MARY GOULDING Uh-huh, and, yeah, and from time to time. 

00:30:15
DAVE And from, ti-, and from time to time he'll talk a little bit longer than he used to and... 

00:30:20
MARY GOULDING Yeah. The reason I asked you. If you, how the rest of your life was, I was wondering if you're into a disappointment racket in general or if, it, your disappointment is just around here. It didn't sound like you were. 

00:30:35
DAVE I'm, I am always able to notice the flaws in things. That's true. I mean, I can, I can go to "Starlight Express" and notice what isn't musically good... 

00:30:45
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:30:45
DAVE ...and, uh, and so on, (crosstalk)in that sense, yes, but it didn't keep me from being glad I went and, uh, , you know, it's, you know, and it was a fascinating thing. 

00:30:55
MARY GOULDING So you might have some fun noticing how you're flawing him and reminding yourself you're going to enjoy him in spite of you astute capacity for finding flaws. 

00:31:10
DAVE That's a, that's very good. L-, I wanna be sure I took that in. So, I could have fun...(crosstalk) 

00:31:20
MARY GOULDING My goodness, his, his fingernail on, that, that one fingernail on the left hand is quite jagged. 

00:31:25
DAVE Right. N-, no, he's very handsome but he'll have an ugly hairdo. 

00:31:30
MARY GOULDING Okay, then you say, "Wow, congratulations I noticed, I noticed his ugly hairdo." 

00:31:40
DAVE Internally I'm saying...(crosstalk) 

00:31:40
MARY GOULDING Yes. 

00:31:40
DAVE ..."Congratulations, I've noticed his ugly hairdo." That's out of the way, I can go ahead and enjoy how handsome he is. Is that? 

00:31:45
MARY GOULDING Yeah. How's that, i-, that's a good answer. Is that good to you? 

00:31:55
DAVE Yeah. 

00:31:55
MARY GOULDING And kind of keep tabs, of, of, how you're, how you're noticing the negative... 

00:32:00
DAVE Uh-huh. 

00:32:00
MARY GOULDING ...and, kin-, let yourself start smiling at yourself about it instead of giving yourself hell. Cuz see, I think you criticized yourself for criticizing yourself for criticizing yourself. 

00:32:10
DAVE Oh you're right. Yeah. So, okay, uh, to just laugh at it? 

00:32:15
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm, (crosstalk)and all of this is your secret. 

00:32:15
DAVE (crosstalk)My dad would've, my dad would've laughed at it. Mm-hmm. 

00:32:15
MARY GOULDING Yeah, and all of this is your secret. 

00:32:20
DAVE Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, uh-huh, (crosstalk)so I laugh internally. 

00:32:20
MARY GOULDING Just like he has secrets. 

00:32:20
DAVE Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:32:25
MARY GOULDING And he's allowed to and so are you. 

00:32:30
DAVE And if I sit there laughing and he asks me, wouldn't that be ridiculous, but don't count on it. 

00:32:40
MARY GOULDING You got it. 

00:32:45
DAVE Thank you. 

00:32:45
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:32:45
DAVE Thank you very much. 

00:32:50
MARY GOULDING Yeah. I hope you enjoy yourself 

00:32:50
DAVE I'm going to. 

00:32:50
MARY GOULDING Okay, bye, b-... Okay, it's now another half hour, uh, would people like questions or would you like, uh, uh, another volunteer? 

00:33:10
AUDIENCE Volunteer. 

00:33:10
MARY GOULDING Oh (ph)people do like shows in this town. Now I'll ask if we've got another volunteer... 

00:33:20
AUDIENCE MEMBER Yeah. 

00:33:20
MARY GOULDING ...now that we know the format of how I work. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:30
MARY GOULDING Okay. While they're signing I'll say that the secret for me of short term therapy is to focus on something very specific immediately. What is it you wanna change? Give a scene that demonstrates it. That way, you're not talking about and when you hear the scene, uh, the person and the incident and the problem come alive. Like with the first one. Uh, until you had the actual woman there it didn't come alive. The actual woman in fantasy. Hi, who are you? 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:20
DIANE NELSON Huh.. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm Diane Nelson. 

00:34:20
MARY GOULDING Okay, and what's up? 

00:34:20
DIANE NELSON I'm a student. I'm a year into the program in Oregon and, uh... 

00:34:25
MARY GOULDING Which program? 

00:34:25
DIANE NELSON ...uh, Masters of Counseling Psychology Program. 

00:34:30
MARY GOULDING Neat. 

00:34:30
DIANE NELSON My third career. 

00:34:35
MARY GOULDING Wow. What'd you have before? 

00:34:35
DIANE NELSON Uh, let's see, mother, for about eleven years, full time and then I went into real estate... 

00:34:40
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:34:40
DIANE NELSON ...and what I'm up here for is, uh, I like the idea of having, the, the chair Um, f-, the first... 

00:34:50
MARY GOULDING Who's in it? 

00:34:50
DIANE NELSON My mother... 

00:34:50
MARY GOULDING Okay 

00:34:50
DIANE NELSON Hey, I can't help it. Um... 

00:34:55
MARY GOULDING Okay. So, what do you want to chance about you? 

00:34:55
DIANE NELSON I wanna change the way I interact with her. 

00:35:00
MARY GOULDING Ah. This is (ph)another one of the interaction. 

00:35:05
DIANE NELSON Yeah. Um, little bi-.... 

00:35:05
MARY GOULDING What's your head say? 

00:35:05
DIANE NELSON Eww, it's hard with her. I'm, uh, gonna be 48 next year. She's 70. She's probably one of the more negative people I know in the world. I don't wanna be like her and I want to accept her for who she is... 

00:35:20
MARY GOULDING Do you? 

00:35:20
DIANE NELSON Oh, God yeah, I mean, (crosstalk)she's my mom. 

00:35:20
MARY GOULDING Why? 

00:35:20
DIANE NELSON Um, I, I, I love her and, um, my father is long gone, dead, so she's the last parent I have and I really want to be able to have a better relationship. A tiny bit of the background is that for the last year, before my husband was able to move out here from Chicago, I lived in the house with my mother... 

00:35:45
MARY GOULDING That must've been... 

00:35:45
DIANE NELSON Never go home. 

00:35:45
MARY GOULDING That must've been difficult for both of you. 

00:35:50
DIANE NELSON It was very difficult. Although I had my own space upstairs she often intruded on it... 

00:35:50
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:35:55
DIANE NELSON ...and that was tough. 

00:35:55
MARY GOULDING Well that was actually her space and you intruded on it. 

00:36:00
DIANE NELSON Sh-, she told me that. 'I can come up here anytime I want Diane.' Um, that was my retreat when we'd have our fights you see. Would be, to, to go up there and, uh, (crosstalk)she would follow. 

00:36:10
MARY GOULDING Okay. So, let's play this out and let's start with, you can be either you or her and say what you want the other to change. You can start with being her or start with being you. 

00:36:25
DIANE NELSON My mother, I'll see if I can do her. 

00:36:30
MARY GOULDING Okay, now what, I for-, what's your daughter's name again mother? 

00:36:35
DIANE NELSON Diane. 

00:36:35
MARY GOULDING And your name? 

00:36:35
DIANE NELSON Jan. 

00:36:40
MARY GOULDING Okay Jan, is she your only daughter? 

00:36:40
DIANE NELSON Yes. 

00:36:40
MARY GOULDING So, my guess is you want a good relationship with her too. 

00:36:45
DIANE NELSON Correct. 

00:36:45
MARY GOULDING Okay, and what is it you want her to change so that you can have a good relationship with her? 

00:36:50
DIANE NELSON I'm in my, oh, okay. Ya know Diane, you're so independent. I just really hate that you're so independent. You, uh, think you know it all... 

00:37:05
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:37:05
DIANE NELSON ...um, you're always criticizing the family. 

00:37:10
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Mo-, Jan, secretly, do you feel a little inferior to her? 

00:37:20
DIANE NELSON Well, at 70, um, I've lost my early beauty. I have a dowager's hump. I, uh, never went past high school. I didn't, I don't think I'm very smart. 

00:37:30
MARY GOULDING Did you have a career? 

00:37:30
DIANE NELSON No. 

00:37:35
MARY GOULDING Uh, and she's getting that damn career which means she'll be able to read your mind. 

00:37:40
DIANE NELSON And boy do I resent that. 

00:37:40
MARY GOULDING I betcha do. I bet you do. Okay, be her, be you. And what do you want her to change? 

00:37:55
DIANE NELSON Mom, I would like you to respect all the things that I've done in my life. I'd like you to be proud of the fact that I've been in charge of my life my whole life. That I've not waited for things to happen to me but have taken control and have gone the direction I wanted to go. 

00:38:10
MARY GOULDING Great. Now come over here and be her and say the same things to you and see if they seem to fit. 

00:38:20
DIANE NELSON Mm. 

00:38:20
MARY GOULDING I want you to be, what was your first sentence? 

00:38:25
DIANE NELSON I want you to be proud of me. 

00:38:25
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:38:30
DIANE NELSON Whew. For the life that I've led... 

00:38:35
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:38:35
DIANE NELSON For the things I have accomplished, um... 

00:38:40
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm, now, move back. Whadya feel? 

00:38:45
DIANE NELSON Well I tell you, there's some parts of this that are, like, out there you haven't heard yet, naturally. 

00:38:50
MARY GOULDING Oh, I believe that. 

00:38:50
DIANE NELSON Yeah. 

00:38:50
MARY GOULDING We haven't been here together very long. 

00:38:55
DIANE NELSON I suppose if, between you...(crosstalk) 

00:38:55
MARY GOULDING First though, is, is there... 

00:38:55
DIANE NELSON Can I not talk to her for a minute? 

00:39:00
MARY GOULDING Yeah, but tell me first if that fit? That she's wanting you to be proud of her too? 

00:39:05
DIANE NELSON Probably. 

00:39:05
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. So, you're both caught up in not getting enough acknowledgment from the other? 

00:39:10
DIANE NELSON Yeah... 

00:39:10
MARY GOULDING Okay. 

00:39:10
DIANE NELSON ...and, and, she's, and if I'm really honest she's probably right. Uh, I'm the fixer in the family... 

00:39:20
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:39:20
DIANE NELSON ...and, uh, three of my brothers, I have three brothers, um, a couple of 'em are not on the ordinary track. They're kind of in, the, the fringes, and so she probably feels, well, I don't ever say, 'mom, it's your fault they're screwed up.' Or my father's fault that they're screwed up, she probably feels that I think that she is... 

00:39:35
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:39:35
DIANE NELSON ...responsible for that. 

00:39:40
MARY GOULDING Well maybe you could both let it be some mysterious genetic traits. 

00:39:45
DIANE NELSON It probably is. 

00:39:45
MARY GOULDING Okay, so, was there something out there that you had wanted to talk about? You said I didn't know what was out there. 

00:39:55
DIANE NELSON I, uh, I just need to find a way to interrelate with her so that all the outside stuff goes away, um... 

00:40:05
MARY GOULDING For instance? 

00:40:05
DIANE NELSON It's all the issues with the brothers and the... 

00:40:05
MARY GOULDING Oh. 

00:40:05
DIANE NELSON Ya know, I have this family that has the spectrum of the DSM IV in it and I know that there is, the, the danger of that when you become a new student and you're into all these new things. 

00:40:15
MARY GOULDING Oh yeah. That is a danger. 

00:40:20
DIANE NELSON I have got a couple of validations from some professors. 

00:40:25
MARY GOULDING Do that again. 

00:40:25
DIANE NELSON I'm sorry. 

00:40:25
MARY GOULDING Don't be sorry. (crosstalk)It might, it's kinda fun. 

00:40:25
DIANE NELSON (crosstalk)We're close to Santa Claus, you know. Sorry. 

00:40:35
MARY GOULDING That may be how you feel about some of them. 

00:40:40
DIANE NELSON It is, it is. 

00:40:40
MARY GOULDING Okay. 

00:40:40
DIANE NELSON Um, I, I just, I, I guess I need to try to find a way to be good with her. To be accepting of who she and... 

00:40:50
MARY GOULDING Sounds like one of the ways would be to not discuss your brothers. (crosstalk)At least... 

00:40:55
DIANE NELSON Enmeshment (ph)is a word that's big in my family. It's, it's, there in my family and it's almost like that is a topic that you can't get around because if, I, I don't bring it up she will definitely bring it up. 

00:41:05
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Well be her now and let's see how she brings it up and see what you can do, to, to evade it okay? Ooh sorry. 

00:41:15
DIANE NELSON Oops, I'm caught... 

00:41:15
MARY GOULDING You okay? 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
DIANE NELSON I was. (ph)Help? Am I on? Okay. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, you're on. 

00:41:25
DIANE NELSON Okay. Let's see, I, I'll try a phone call with her. Ring, ring, hi mom. 

00:41:30
MARY GOULDING Now who are you? 

00:41:30
DIANE NELSON I'm now the mother. Hi. How ya doin' mom? Oh I'm fine. What's wrong mom? 

00:41:40
MARY GOULDING Oh, mistake one. Oh, oh, oh. 

00:41:45
DIANE NELSON Ya gotta answer, she's your mother. 

00:41:50
MARY GOULDING Ya gotta answer but you don't have to ask what's wrong unless you wanna hear. 

00:41:55
DIANE NELSON She'll tell me anyway. 

00:41:55
MARY GOULDING Probably, but... 

00:41:55
DIANE NELSON I've tried the other, it doesn't work. 

00:42:00
MARY GOULDING Uh. 

00:42:00
DIANE NELSON Oh, you know. Steve and Terry are having another fight. She's threatening to kick him out again. Oh and how's Michael? Well, you know, he and Lori are having a fight and she's threatening to kick him out again. Those girls... 

00:42:15
MARY GOULDING Okay, come on over here. Now what could you say that would affirm her and keep you out of the middle of it? Like, for example, "That's difficult for you." 

00:42:30
DIANE NELSON Yeah. I've always been in the middle. Always. 

00:42:35
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:42:35
DIANE NELSON Um... 

00:42:35
MARY GOULDING Try that one. That, "That is difficult for you." 

00:42:40
DIANE NELSON Yeah. Gee mom, so what did you do today? 

00:42:50
MARY GOULDING No, that's, "That's difficult for you." 

00:42:50
DIANE NELSON Oh, oh, that's difficult for you isn't it? I see what you mean, telling her that it's difficult... 

00:42:55
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:42:55
DIANE NELSON ...for her to have to be in the middle of it. 

00:42:55
MARY GOULDING I feel bad about it too. 

00:43:00
DIANE NELSON I feel bad about it too mom. It is, it is a problem. 

00:43:00
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:43:00
DIANE NELSON Well what, course she would say immediately, "What should we do about it Diane? 

00:43:05
MARY GOULDING There isn't anything we can do. 

00:43:10
DIANE NELSON Ah. There isn't anything we can do mom. It's between them. 

00:43:10
MARY GOULDING And what's your day? 

00:43:15
DIANE NELSON Yeah. What's your day been like other than that? 

00:43:15
MARY GOULDING You got it. 

00:43:20
DIANE NELSON Yeah. 

00:43:20
MARY GOULDING Are you willing to do that? 

00:43:20
DIANE NELSON I'm willing to give it my best shot, yeah. I definitely am. 

00:43:25
MARY GOULDING You can probably keep, im-, improving your shots as you go along too. 

00:43:25
DIANE NELSON I think so. 

00:43:30
MARY GOULDING And it is, maybe, fun secretly to look in the DSM IV. I've never looked in it but, uh... 

00:43:35
DIANE NELSON Don't. You'll find far too many family members if you do. 

00:43:40
MARY GOULDING Well, if you look at it just don't tell her about it because it's really 9/10ths bullshit anyway. 

00:43:50
DIANE NELSON I can't wait to go back to school and tell the professors that. 

00:43:50
MARY GOULDING I didn't, I didn't hear ya. 

00:43:55
DIANE NELSON I said I can't wait to go back tell the professors you said that. 

00:43:55
MARY GOULDING Oh, that's another lets you and him fight. 

00:44:00
DIANE NELSON Okay. Hmm. 

00:44:05
MARY GOULDING Hmm. 

00:44:05
DIANE NELSON Thanks. 

00:44:10
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:44:10
DIANE NELSON It's been helpful. Now if I can just put it into practice like the preceding, um, people up here. 

00:44:15
MARY GOULDING Yeah, uh, all of the work people have done need to practice, and the major thing, for, to practice, if, if it's okay to tell you... 

00:44:20
DIANE NELSON Mm-hmm. Oh please. 

00:44:20
MARY GOULDING Is, it's a, is to practice, uh, le-, letting her know that you esteem her, and that neither of you are in any way responsible for diagnosing or treating your brother's families. 

00:44:35
DIANE NELSON Ah. Thanks. 

00:44:40
MARY GOULDING Yeah. 

00:44:40
DIANE NELSON That's a load off. It really (crosstalk)is. 

00:44:40
MARY GOULDING (crosstalk)Yeah, you'll learn as you get into practice that there's only one group you absolutely can never help and that's your family. 

00:44:50
DIANE NELSON Yeah, I was afraid of that. 

00:44:50
MARY GOULDING Yeah. Okay. 

00:44:50
DIANE NELSON Thank you. 

00:44:55
MARY GOULDING Sure thing. Okay. 

00:45:00
AUDIENCE MEMBER Can you take anymore? 

00:45:05
MARY GOULDING Uh, no because it's now, (crosstalk)we have ten minutes and I don't wanna restrict it to ten minutes. (crosstalk)No, sorry. I think we have, what, 15 minutes maybe, uh, and that's a good amount of time for, uh, questions, about, about what went on. 

00:45:20
(inaudible ) 

00:45:25
MARY GOULDING Uh, you have to talk in the mic. This is all being taped. 

00:45:25
(inaudible ) 

00:45:35
MARY GOULDING Uh, I can't hear you and I don't, wanna, anything but mic talk. Is, is there a mic? (crosstalk)I can't see. Is someone on it? (crosstalk)Okay, anybody have a question about the theory, thank you, or the practice? 

00:45:55
[sil.] 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN Can you say a few words about what let you know, uh, for the woman who just went, um, with her mother, for her to be saying the same thing as her mother as she was saying as herself? 

00:46:10
MARY GOULDING Oh. Uh, because they usually are the same things and we don't hear that. Each person, thank you for asking that, we each want to change the other person, and if you switch back and forth like that it softens the desire to change the other, and sometimes I'll play with it more and have them just say, change, change, and move really quickly until they get the point, that's what keeping them apart is each is demanding that the other change rather than appreciate what's there. 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN And that, is that usually change in the same way? 

00:46:50
MARY GOULDING No. Everybody's different. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN I have a list of things for Dave to do when he gets to Phoenix so if he looks me up I'll give him... 

00:47:00
MARY GOULDING Okay, thank you. Now see how nice that is on tape? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN I don't know, uh, what re- decision therapy is and what you were doing up there looked to me, not that it really makes any difference, uh, Gestalt, uh, therapy, but, if you were doing re-decision therapy up there, will you kind of briefly, uh, sketch what the theory is and how that... 

00:47:20
MARY GOULDING Sure. Uh, we call re-de, we call it re-decision and it's a blend of transactional analysis and Gestalt, and usually that involves going back in time and recreating a story from the child ego state. You saw that in the first piece of work. Uh, where the story had made him a potential killer, when really all he'd done is given his father a little bruise, and of course, he hadn't even done it willingly, we could've gone into that too, But, it's going back and seeing things, different-, differently, then being different, in a, in a free child (ph)kind of way, being, uh, being different, thinking something different, feeling, different, differently about it and behaving differently but not changing others, and yes, you're right, it is, it is Gestalt technique. This is because we learn from both Fritz and Eric Berne, both of whom lived in the same area, and, uh, and Virginia. It was, those were rich days in the late sixties. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Is that nice laughter, is that always been a part of you? 

00:48:35
MARY GOULDING I think so. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN So you had that even before you went into training? 

00:48:40
MARY GOULDING I think so. Thank you. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN These three pieces of work went quickly and went well. I was wondering if you could talk about what, in your experience, keeps the work from going so well? What kind of... 

00:49:00
MARY GOULDING Ah. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN ...factors or variables you might see in your interaction or the person that's presenting for help? 

00:49:05
MARY GOULDING Uh, yes. What can bollocks it up? One is if we had just talked about, about his patients in general, uh, there would have been no way of setting a scene so, th-, so that he could be as completely in both scenes, the present and the past, and many therapists talk about, uh, and don't repeat, "Hey, be there, be there." Tell the scene as if you're there. Bring your past to the present. That's very important. Then it's the attitude of the therapist who's in charge of what, and I want, here is where you'll see the influence of Ellis on my work, and you've, if any of you have been to hear Ellis know that he says you are responsible for your own thinking, your own feeling, your own behavior, and as long as you let something else be responsible, uh, there's no way of getting well. I have heard therapists here say things like, "The anger came up." Uh, "The issue presented itself." These things, these, sen-, these kinds of sentences tell the client not to get well. Even if they're said by the world's best therapist, because a therapist in his own heart, doesn-, believes that people aren't responsible. So it's a grammar lesson. It's like when I said, "Who wants to work?" And I could hear Bob saying, "Not work, do!" Uh, what do you want to change about yourself today? Very few therapists start an hour that way. Then, uh, I just know that we'll get somewhere. It, and, if there's nowhere else to get we can pull back and look at how come not. If you have a client who says no, I don't wanna talk to my mother, fine, she's in this chair. Tell her that. Ya know, I don't wanna talk to you mother. Okay, tell her some more about why you don't wanna talk to her. It's that I really believe people will do these things. Now when, you don't, when it doesn't work it's usually because, we-, we're not in the right track. The contract was something that someone really doesn't want or it's we left it mushy by not getting a specific scene, or, uh, I just don't know where to go, patient doesn't know where to go, we don't fit together. So, it's very, very important never to blame the client. I think it's very important that the client have a success experience. That's much more important when there's an audience like this than it is in your own office. Your own office, you, it, it does-, it doesn't matter, you can also go deeper and do some things that might be harmful, in a, f-, a moment's time, because, the, your client trusts you and knows that in the long run this will be, ov-, th-, this is important. Here I wouldn't do something that people could look at the next day and say, "Oh, why in the world did I let myself look like such a fool?" and I think that won't happen because I think they were each successful. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN I hear your disdain for DSM IV and I don't like labeling people either, but, it, it helps us to talk sometimes. 

00:52:20
MARY GOULDING I guess it, (crosstalk)I, I, don't, I can't imagine... 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN I, I think in terms of, like, someone who, like, what we do diagnose as borderline and narcissistic. 

00:52:30
MARY GOULDING Uh, I, (crosstalk)I agree with you, uh, on that, that there are diagnosis. I don't know if they do as much, uh, help as harm because usually the client finds out the diagnosis as if it were fixed in stone and sometimes the diagnosis is misgiven. Many people are called borderlines cuz they don't cooperate with their therapist, who are idiots. Uh, I would, rath-, I liked TA definitions and of course, that's my bias, where we, I like, I like diagnosis by where the stuck point is rather than a label, like, this person hasn't been, uh, hasn't been successful in life by his own standards. Th-, that's a good label to me because that's what the person said. Th-, this person has great difficulty trusting anybody and borderline, I admit, is a good diagnosis. A lot of them aren't, especially the diagnosis of children. And I like to, I was making fun of it on behalf of her because, you know, she's a student, and, and, and professors are, uh, do, I should say, these professors want you to learn it so that you can talk with other professionals and that makes excellent sense. Just don't think learning it is going to having anything to do with curing clients. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN I think he was first. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Hi. Hi, uh, two questions, one, in your, uh, description the objectives was three viable contracts for change, if you could outline those for us, I appreciate it, and second, are there any clientele you would not use this process with? 

00:54:15
MARY GOULDING Oh thank you. Yes, whatever the questions are on there I should help you with them because I didn't know a year ago, when I wrote the questions, what I'd be doing. A viable contract is to change behavior as, uh, some of these people wanted to do. Change their, change affect, uh, leave in the past what belongs in the past. Those three you can all use. There's lots more, and then the, what was your second question? 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Uh, clientele that you would not use, uh, this process with, uh, are there any (crosstalk)clients? 

00:54:50
MARY GOULDING Okay, I have never worked with psychotic people, uh, at least not since I was quote, "grown-up". Yeah, I worked as a student. Uh, so, I wouldn't. I have watched with tremendous glee, uh, tapes done by trainees of ours with very retarded psychotics and what they do is much more adult, adult. They don't do regressive work but they also stop babying them and stop thinking for them and stop giving them tasks, and, and encourage them to give themselves tasks to make themselves clear. It, it works well. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:55:25
MARY GOULDING It works in the head of the therapist, if the therapist is willing to modify to fit. Many people use this with children. I don't work with children. 

00:55:35
UNKONWN Thank you. 

00:55:35
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. Were there any other questions on that questionnaire that you need to answer the questions if you're from the State of California? Psychologists have to answer them. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. I'm from the state of California and I just have a comment to make. Um, one of the things that, I, I, I felt when you had the last, uh, person up there talking and reflecting feelings is so important that she doesn't have to solve problems for her mother. Her brothers' problems and all these other things that she can just reflect in her mother's sorrow... 

00:56:10
MARY GOULDING Mm-hmm. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN ...and her mother's feelings. I thought that was beautiful. Thank you. 

00:56:15
MARY GOULDING You're welcome. Where are we? 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN I, I had a question, on the, on your left microphone. Um, in the first case, it, it became evident that the actual injury was pretty benign for that gentlemen. I just wondered where and how you would've taken it had he actually paralyzed or done, some (crosstalk)something that created more than that. 

00:56:35
MARY GOULDING Uh, yeah. Then he, then he, he would of course have to allow himself his grief. He'd have to forgive himself. Maybe create the kind of benign parent in himself who would say, "You were seven years old. You did this under duress. If it weren't under duress, you were seven years old. Uh, ya know, and it's time to forgive yourself for something when you were seven. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:57:00
MARY GOULDING Sure. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN How... 

00:57:05
MARY GOULDING I don't know if we have time, we have barely a minute so this will have to be, uh, like a... 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN How would you use this for sexual abuse survivors who are, in effect, re-traumatized by bringing that person into the chair, that, that was their perpetrator? 

00:57:20
MARY GOULDING In the Evolution of Psychotherapy book that they're selling here, uh, the first, the 1990, I have a whole chapter on that. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Great. Thank you. 

00:57:25
MARY GOULDING Yes, and I think now it's time to stop. I'm being given little signs. Thanks.
