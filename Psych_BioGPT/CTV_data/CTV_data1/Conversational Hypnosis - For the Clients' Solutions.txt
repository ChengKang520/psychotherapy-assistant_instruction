Conversational Hypnosis-For the Clients' Solutions 

00:00:25
Betty Alex Erickson, MS, LPC, LFMT 

00:00:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So I'm Betty Alex Erickson and this is a clinical demonstration. So if you want to be a subject stop thinking about it, don't raise your hand now. Okay. And Jeff asked us to read the educational objectives. He did. Three ways to offer new perspectives to clients. Given the patient, given the demonstration subject because you're not a patient. Umm… describe three ways to surmount client reluctance to proceed more adaptively. Okay. Way number one. Don't be reluctant. Okay. Okay. So umm… I'm gonna look at, excuse me one more time umm… okay making sure that I get to use conversational trance because to me conversational trance is as powerful as a formal trance except very unusual incidences uh… situations and it's what got to use for the last ten years of his life almost exclusively. It's easier and it helps clients in my opinion from the beginning to, it enhances their autonomy and it enhances their ability to know I can do anything because you can do anything. Anything you're physically capable of doing, you can do. And I can get to a really important thing and you can't tell people that because they're not gonna listen to you. But when you imply it in a multiplicity of ways, it's taken in and umm… okay now, I do have to add the card out. I think techniques are extremely important when you're learning to use hypnosis. Because it provides a framework and structure. Okay, but once you know how to use techniques really well, recognize the power of a conversational trance. Okay, all right, now in order to do a clinical demonstration, guess what I need? Now, I don't want… I would prefer a contained problem. I actually don't want a problem well it begin the day I was born and it's got more since then, okay. Because this is a demonstration and you the demonstrationee gets to have whatever benefits you want to take. So I need a demonstration subject. I see one, two, three. This is called pressure. Okay, you were first, wave and first. So the other people who thank you. And if we have, how about this. If you are really good, we can have two. How is that for pressure? Okay, come on up. And you are gonna have to venture the stairs so there, you can bench your way around. Oh, and you have to sign something, someone get a piece of paper to sign because I can't do anything until you sign. Your name is Lily. 

00:05:35
LILY Yes. 

00:05:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I love that name. 

00:05:35
LILY oh, thank you. 

00:05:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON It's a beautiful name. 

00:05:40
LILY I love that name too, in fact, I chose it myself. Yes. I'll fill in the rest of the time and day too or… 

00:05:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Let her, I don't know, you, you tell her what's she's supposed to do. 

00:06:00
[sil.] 

00:06:10
LILY Can I fill that out later to save time. Okay. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON In the mean time, do you have any questions that you want to ask? This is not the bravest audience, I've ever been with. Yes sir. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Do you do training for us newbies as you polish them a session ago. 

00:06:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Do I do training? I live in Dallas. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Great, Dr. Yako lives in San Diego, and Dr. Zahakis once here and… 

00:06:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON That's true. I don't have specifically organized trainings when people organize a group then I do training. Okay. Okay. All right. So Lily to ask that you sit here and you need a mic. That was a good question, thank you. Okay. Do you know, how to put this mics on? 

00:07:15
LILY I think, I can figure it out. 

00:07:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Where are you from? 

00:07:20
LILY From East Tennessee. 

00:07:25
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Oh, I love your accent. I knew she had a delightful accent. 

00:07:30
LILY It's a big part of who I am. It gets a lot of attention. 

00:07:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Well, it's charming. 

00:07:35
LILY Right. 

00:07:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay Dokey(ph). Now is that the most comfortable position for you? 

00:07:45
LILY Right now, it is. 

00:07:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay dokey. What's your second most comfortable position? 

00:07:50
LILY Umm… I don't know. 

00:07:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Uh… that's something to think about because I wouldn't ask you to go to the second best. So… 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:05
LILY That's the kind of person you are. 

00:08:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yes. So what I would… Have you been in another, you've been in another groups, other presentations I've done? 

00:08:20
LILY Yes, I've been in everyone, I've seen available. 

00:08:25
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. 

00:08:25
LILY Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Because I thought you already know, you already know that you… That's kind of nice. So what I would like you to do because this is a demonstration is I would like you to encapsulate and in a way remembering that there is an audience out there tell me what you want from me? 

00:09:05
LILY What I would like is to be able to… 

00:09:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Want. 

00:09:10
LILY Oh. 

00:09:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON From there. 

00:09:15
LILY Oh, that's different. Yeah. Yeah. I want you to help me be able to let it in without contracting when people uh… seem. 

00:09:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON When people… 

00:09:40
LILY Seem. 

00:09:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Seem. 

00:09:40
LILY To like me and want to spend time with me, I think the first thing that pops in my head is, it's maybe temporary, you know that I can believe it at the moment but that after they spend more time with me I might change their mind. 

00:10:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. I want to, I want to stop you, I'm gonna come back to this. Because I've no hesitation about interacting with people. Is that okay? 

00:10:10
LILY Yes. Please do. 

00:10:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So you said what you want from me is that to be more open when people want to be nice to you, that's what I heard and maybe be friends with you. Am I hearing it accurately? 

00:10:35
LILY Umm… I don't know if I like the word nice. 

00:10:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. 

00:10:40
LILY Umm… but I like the part about being friends with me. 

00:10:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So they want to establish a friendly relationship with you. Instead of believing, it's only temporary, I want to stop you right there. Oh, Lily. Everything is temporary. 

00:11:05
[sil.] 

00:11:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON When you had an additional meaning to the word temporary whatever stays temporary. 

00:11:30
[sil.] 

00:11:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So I think… and you know as you've been in my other presentations, you're supposed to stop me if I'm not accurate. You know that. 

00:11:50
LILY I didn't know that. Yeah. 

00:11:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Then I'm announcing to you. Any time, I'm not accurate, stop me. 

00:12:05
LILY Yeah. 

00:12:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Now, I don't really care if it's something you don't like to hear. But if I'm not accurate stop me. 

00:12:25
LILY Okay. Well, I know somewhere inside myself that everything is temporary. 

00:12:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Right. 

00:12:35
LILY And… 

00:12:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You had an additional meaning, I know that. 

00:12:40
LILY Yeah. 

00:12:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And that's what you want to outgrow. 

00:12:45
LILY That's what I want to… 

00:12:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Outgrow. 

00:12:50
LILY Outgrow. Yes. Yes 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Isn't it amazingly broadening to realize you were the one who laughed when you said that? You know, in hierarchy of feelings, because you know we got our brains, this and this get in a fight. Guess, which one is gonna win? Oh, every time. And right from that is, lips from his written word, people defend their feelings and believes passionately. And you know, it's always been amusing to me because I categorize feelings. We make up our feelings, you know that? 

00:14:10
LILY I think so. 

00:14:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. Do you have children? 

00:14:15
LILY No, I don't. 

00:14:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. But do you have, do any of your friends have children? 

00:14:20
LILY Yeah. 

00:14:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay, okay. 

00:14:20
LILY And I've, I've was once a child myself too. 

00:14:25
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Oh, yeah. 

00:14:30
LILY I remember some. 

00:14:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON But that was only temporary. 

00:14:30
LILY Yes. 

00:14:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So there is three categories of feelings in my totally unscientific definition, okay. One of the feelings, I'm not talking about hard wired ones about fear of falling and under part, okay, but the feelings that we make up. One category is the feelings that aren't accurate but are cute. For example, you know your friends probably think they don't think. They feel, they know and will defend passionately that their babies are cuter than my babies were. And they are wrong. But nobody cares. It's like all brides are beautiful. No, all brides are not beautiful. But it's the category of feelings is, it doesn't hurt us. It's kind of cute. So those kinds of feelings are kind of cute. Then use a category of feelings that only hurt us situationally like if I were afraid of snakes, you know, the last time or lizards, make it lizards, because a lot of people are afraid of snakes. Umm… if I were afraid of lizards, do you know the last lizard I saw? It was one my cat threw up. So but if I lived in the Amazon jungle, that would be harmful to me. But situationally, in our area of Dallas Texas, I don't see lizards. So you follow what I mean. That's another part and then there is a third category of feelings that hurt us another one is, if I were, I thought elevators were gonna crash down and squash me, I can live in Dallas Texas. But I couldn't live in New York City. Then the third category of feelings, they are no more accurate than all brides are beautiful but they harm us not situationally, they just harm us. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And those… quite passionately, because we learn them in some place and there is lot… of buttressing of support for not trusting people in the world. I thought the only thing I've ever bought off television is a book that I recommend to all my clients because I think it's a wonderful book and it's called, I saw the author Davin D. Baker (ph.) interviewed on television and he said, one sentence and I said, I'm buying that book. You notice him. 

00:18:50
LILY No. 

00:18:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Among many wise things in the book, he said man is the only creature on earth who talks themselves out of his instinct. Mouse, Deer's, rustle paper something and he runs away to live another day. And people don't pay attention to their instincts. But I think you're hypervigilant. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON So yeah, you're hyper-vigilant. 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON What is suppose because you're the expert on you. You know that. What is suppose, would help you learn how to discriminate, discern between instinct which better keep and listen to and some incorrectly learnt behaviors. What do you think? And if you can't hear me, excuse me. If I'm talking too soft because I do have a tendency to lower my voice. Poke the person in front of you until somebody in my vision can say, louder, okay because I can't see people and I will try to remember really hard to speak louder. Okay, so sorry. 

00:21:00
LILY Yeah. 

00:21:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah. 

00:21:05
LILY Well, I think what helps me, I've already been using it some but not as consistently as I would like, so I've already made a lot of progress on this issue. I just want to make more progress. 

00:21:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Already learned. 

00:21:20
LILY Yeah. 

00:21:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON To outgrow as I like those terminologies. Because those terminologies to me and more accurate to the state of human beings who are always trying to do it right. Because we all are. So you've already learnt how to outgrow some of your major inaccurate response. 

00:22:00
LILY Yes. 

00:22:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON These are really vital question. How much have you congratulated yourself? 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
LILY Actually, I'm not sure if I've specifically congratulated myself on this but I congratulate myself a lot. It's something, I've been learning and lots of times I'll do something and I'll say even out loud because I've spent a lot of time alone. I don't say it in front of others. 

00:22:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:22:50
LILY But I'll say, I'm proud of you really and I'll say that out loud, I'll say, I'm proud of you really, you know and I talk through my skill. 

00:23:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I think that's wonderful. Hurray for me. 

00:23:00
LILY Yeah, yeah. 

00:23:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And I also think you are really wise not to say in front of groups of strangers. 

00:23:10
LILY Yeah, although. 

00:23:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON These people don't count. 

00:23:10
LILY Yeah, yeah. 

00:23:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON But you know, you said something very interesting. You know, what you said that was really, really interesting? I love people, I really, really do. Because you really don't know, do you? 

00:23:30
LILY No. 

00:23:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON This is where I love people because we are so fascinatingly interesting and sometimes we don't even know it. 

00:23:50
LILY Well, I think it takes people like you, Betty Alex to help people know that, you know, it's like if you don't have someone else to help you, it's hard, hard to change, yeah. 

00:24:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I, I will buy a portion of that and I yeah, I'll take a portion of it. But one of the things, okay, I have to ask you a question because you're a demonstration subject right now. 

00:24:20
LILY Right. 

00:24:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. Do you know, you've been going in and out of trance? 

00:24:25
LILY Sort of, yeah, yeah. 

00:24:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Sort of. 

00:24:30
LILY Yeah. 

00:24:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Do you the audience know she's been going in and out of trance? Okay. Sorry. But, but I'm sorry to because isn't that, that's interesting thing number two, okay. The interesting thing you've said, I'm gonna talk louder that you said that I'm focused on, let me back up, I don't want to forget that, okay. Your unconscious is like a three year old, five year old child happy, joyous, loving, sharing, curious, fearless and we got a civilize them because you can't run across streets and you've got to pay attention. You got to stay in that line, you can't grab the chicken drumstick off the table like. So you have to civilize some something. But a lot of times we forget that we have, we don't have to but we have to be in touch with that child like portion of us. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Because that's our unconscious and that's where so much comes from. That happy, wonderful five year old who can stop and look at a rainbow in awe. Who can say, I'm proud of really, I'm proud of me. Look how good are you. Okay. You said, so, so you've got, oh, some meaning almost there, almost there, I can see, you know that. Now, but you don't need me. You might want me and have it, that's good. But you don't need me. You know, who you need? 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I know, you know but this is a demonstration, if you were in my office, I'd just keep going. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:30
LILY Well, you know, I would say myself uh… 

00:27:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I love people. 

00:27:35
LILY Yeah. 

00:27:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Do you know? I would say one of the things that okay, I'm gonna digress but not really. 

00:27:50
LILY Now that I don't believe you. But it's okay. 

00:27:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON But it's kind of, you know, conversational gambit. 

00:28:00
LILY Yeah. 

00:28:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON One of the things that I do with clients because you know how in grad school, they tell you, you got to develop rapport yeah and trust and stuff like that. Okay and I'm a rather impatient person. I want to spend time. So I look at them and I'll do the whole thing with you, okay but then I'm going back directly to you. Now you're a demonstration of a demonstration. Okay, all right, is that okay. 

00:28:35
LILY Yes. 

00:28:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. I say, you know, Lily, I'm probably one of the most trustworthy people you are ever gonna meet. Oh, yeah, you did it and I always get this click in their eye where it's crystal clear they are thinking who are you to say that uh-huh, when you don't even know me? Okay, yeah because there is this little flicker in the eye. 

00:29:05
LILY Yeah. 

00:29:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And I'm gonna tell you and I'm gonna explain that, okay. I'm gonna tell you why. I got to talk on two levels. One is from my heart and one is from here, my brain. And from my heart you know, you know, I care, you know, I love all my clients. But up here, you know, I love you. Up here, I don't care. Win some, lose some. It doesn't matter. Even though you know I love you, I love all my patients, clients, I love people. But I don't care. I know what that gives you, do you know? That gives you freedom because I want nothing from you. I want it with you. I want it for you. But nothing from you. And that's why I'm trustworthy. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And since you're a demonstration of a demonstration, could you feel something with that? 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You don't have to come out of your trance. Okay. But I have to explain it to them. 

00:31:10
LILY Yeah. 

00:31:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay, so you could stay exactly where you want to be. When I say that, I'm probably one of the most trustworthy people you will ever meet. She heard, you heard naturally, okay, but yeah the patient usually hears, how can you say you are trustworthy. I didn't say that. I had three, four, disclaimers in that one short sentence. First of all, I had you know, nobody says, you know in a serious conversation. You take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? Yeah, you know, I do. Okay. I am probably, that's number two. Probably means there is a bigger wiggle room in there. One of, that again one of maybe one out of a thousand or more trustworthy than one out of two, you know. Bigger wiggle room in that. On the third one, you will ever meet which mean ever you're gonna meet lots of people more trustworthy than me. I'm saying without saying but I'm saying. Your conscious don't hear that and then I say the truth. The truth is I do love. I love people which by the way is a good way to tell your clients you love them because you can't say I love you unless you're really skilled at saying, because it's inappropriate but you can say, I love people. Well, if there are people, they are included and I love all my clients. I love all my demonstrations. So then I say the truth. I love, I love you and you know exactly what I mean because your unconscious does. And I want nothing from you. And you know that because I've been truthful. For you, with you and immediately without even knowing that it is done, the commonality of untrustworthy interactions is somebody wants something covert. I got a hidden agenda here. But I don't have a hidden agenda but that's the commonality of untrustworthy interactions and the commonality of trustworthy interactions is I want nothing from you. That isn't overt because I've never had a client say, well you want money from me, well that's obvious. That's part of the deal. I don't have to say that. And in all of the years I've done this, I had one client say, oh, you want something from me and I said what's that? And he said and I quote "You want knowledge and I'm a very interesting person." 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON That cog in the machine because I learn from everybody which again is the truth. So, you are really, I'm gonna come back to you directly but you really very helpful to the group demonstration subject because you allow me to digress but not really and you know the interesting thing that you said the first really interesting. 

00:35:40
LILY I feel wonder. 

00:35:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I'm not to back you. The first one was when I said do you praise yourself? And you said, well about other things I really do. Remember that? 

00:35:55
LILY Yes, yeah. 

00:36:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I say, I'm proud of you Lily. Isn't that interesting? And then unfortunately I've forgotten the second important one. But it was the same kind of walling off. 

00:36:25
LILY Oh! So, I didn't really even answer your question. 

00:36:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah, you did because I said to you praise yourself as a skill. 

00:36:35
LILY Oh, okay, yeah. 

00:36:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And you said yeah, I do truthfully. Yeah, but we both knew because you've been in and out of a trance what I was really asking to praise yourself for the progress, for the growth that you've made. That, you didn't answer it but so and you know, that's fine. You know, that however, whenever you learn this, at this point in your life, it's not as useful as you want it to be. You know that? 

00:37:45
LILY I'm not sure what you're saying is not as when you said it's not as useful as it used to be that what's not as useful as it used to be. 

00:37:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON To culturing, friendly, giving, loving interactions with other people as well, it's temporary and maybe, I need to pull back. Because I think because it's a very, that's a very useful trait to pull back. Very useful. When it's needed because our, I even practice. 

00:38:45
LILY Uh… don't practice therapy, I teach the Alexander technique. 

00:38:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Oh, yeah, I know that. 

00:38:50
LILY Yes. 

00:38:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON He was a remarkable guy. Okay because we all know the people there is a balance between oh he won't hit me again while your eyes widened in horror and no, I don't want the chocolate because you might want something from me later. It's a happy medium and that's the discernment that I'm not sure. That's why I say it's not useful because I think you go to, got to protect myself. 

00:39:40
LILY Yeah. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You're not protecting yourself from me. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You know that. 

00:40:10
LILY Yeah, I feel a lot psyche, I feel pretty psyche with you, not completely. But pretty psyche, really. 

00:40:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You are at the stage, expose to what 85 people here? You'd be nuts to consider yourself totally safe but it's 85 people out there and you're doing a really good job of being open enough. That's discernment, hurray for Lily. Do you know why it's discernment? 

00:41:05
LILY Because it's a way of reality, yeah. 

00:41:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON 85 strangers in the room, right or 80 strangers. Yeah, that's real reality. 

00:41:20
LILY Yeah. 

00:41:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON If we were alone, you know, we are connected. 

00:41:30
LILY Yeah. 

00:41:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And you know you've been in a trance and you know, you have looked inside and felt things. Does your life put you felt? 

00:41:55
[sil.] 

00:42:05
LILY A lot of the idea, yeah, not all of the idea, I still feel some of the then on guard or, you call it hyper-vigilant, I don't like that. 

00:42:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. 

00:42:15
LILY But I like alive. 

00:42:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. 

00:42:20
LILY Yeah. 

00:42:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON There is 85 people there. 

00:42:20
LILY Yeah. 

00:42:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Are you nuts? 

00:42:25
LILY Yeah. 

00:42:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON This is a prime example of discernment. Because I'll bet if you were in the office and relaxed your guard enough to really going in a trance which you want to do so why don't you do that? 

00:42:55
LILY You know. 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Because you can let my voice be a backdrop while you let your own wisdom flourish in a different way because it says as though, it's done a good job but you're not nurturing it sideways growth. 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And what I want you to consider, what I want you to consider is that this grown woman who's brave enough to volunteer, at first with a group in front of a group, of essentially total strangers and the paradox of her saying but you know, I don't really trust because like so many paradoxes, the trust that makes sense but not really because the only one I want you, there we go, very nice. The only one that, I want you to trust totally and not me. I mean too. Not the audience, there is too many of them is guess though, I don't want you to answer, I'm just asking a rhetorical question. The only one you really have to trust… 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And cherish. That's right. Because that's the bedrock and somehow some way, you didn't get, I think get the bedrock, the sturdius dirtiness of that bedrock. Because I have a day, it took cat would come home. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON But only you in the depths of a trance can hear your unconscious, now stay here please. Your unconscious response in a child like way. We all know people, well, yeah probably that's really good but part of that is child like. We all know people who are truly morbidly obese and they will even say it keeps people away from me. Well, they are so right. But that's a childish, not ish, child like response because your unconscious has such wisdom it can factor in adult wisdom which you have learnt and no child can have wisdom. Well, when you learn wisdom through pain. And the wisdom that you have learnt, the adult wisdom can factor in to unconscious and often you have to do is pay attention. 

00:48:30
[sil.] 

00:48:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON And then practice. And when you've really got that and… can say to yourself out loud because this group there is a lot of strangers in it but I see a lot of really nice faces. You can say, I did good in front of them. But you won't. And if you want, not if you want but I'm willing to do as I'm gonna give you, you know time is elastic. When I give you one minute of quiet time, oh, go back please. One minute of quiet time which will be all the internal time that you need to reorganize most of what you have just learnt and I'll tell you one minute of quiet time all the internal time you need is over beginning now. 

00:50:10
[sil.] 

00:51:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON It's almost over. The quiet time. What internal talk you have. Because you opened your eyes exactly, really and truly. 

00:51:25
[sil.] 

00:51:30
LILY You know, I wouldn't have wanted more time. I was just yeah. 

00:51:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON All the internal time you need. And you know you did good. And one of the wonderful things about doing good especially the way you did, you want to know what it is? 

00:51:50
LILY Yes, I do. 

00:51:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. You get, get to be surprised if you remember to say, well, woohoo there I am. 

00:52:10
LILY Well, woohoo. 

00:52:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Woohoo, yeah right, right Homer Simpson, woohoo, doughnuts. 

00:52:15
LILY Yeah. 

00:52:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Absolutely. Excellent, excellent. Now what I want, I really want from you because we got about five minutes left is I want you to know, to promise me nothing will change no matter what they ask or say or what I say, nothing good will change. Pinky promise. Pinky promise, nothing good will change. 

00:52:55
LILY Or it might get even better. 

00:53:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. 

00:53:05
LILY Yeah. 

00:53:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Perfect. 

00:53:05
LILY That it won't go. 

00:53:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Pinky promise. It won't go. Perfect. Okay, you were wonderful. Okay. Okay any questions? She was wonderful. 

00:53:30
[sil.] 

00:53:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Will you do me a big old favor, you when I say do it again because she didn't see you. I want her to see you. She did wonderful. 

00:53:45
LILY Oh, thank you. Thank you. 

00:53:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. Any questions? 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN Can you please repeat the three categories of feelings? 

00:54:05
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Oh, the one was that we make, we make a mark. Please repeat the three categories of feelings. The ones we, because we make up except for a very few. Uh… the kind that never hurt is that are kind of cute. My baby is cuter than your baby. Right, you know, I'm wrong, I know you're wrong. But is kind of cute. Okay. Situational ones where if I'm afraid of elevators in New York City, it's gonna hurt me. But if I'm in Dallas Texas, it's not gonna hurt me. Okay. I'm the ones that always hurt. I'm not good enough is a good example. Okay. Any other questions? 

00:54:55
[sil.] 

00:55:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Why did I not have questions for you? Why did, oh, you have questions, see how somebody is gonna rescue you? This is like in high school, you know, oh, would you explain that problem? 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN When you umm… when you told, told Lily about you, your heart and your head, I had that also as a metaphor. 

00:55:25
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON You heard… 

00:55:30
UNKNOWN I heard, I heard that as a metaphor for like trust, you can umm… leave people but part of you doesn't have to need anything from them. Was that just my interpretation or is that… 

00:55:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON That you can love people with this but what? 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN So when you were talking about… 

00:55:45
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. So at the end of the question. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN I wonder if it was uh… my friend John type of story where because I, I interpreted it as umm… I could be, I could be friendly with people but not, I could still protect myself. So I didn't know if you were doing on purpose? 

00:56:05
[sil.] 

00:56:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I have no recollection of that. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON But however anybody wants to interpret it, if it's useful, it's I'm happy with. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:20
[sil.] 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN I just had a quick about sort of how did you. 

00:56:30
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I can't hear you. 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN Sorry because it was a little more like the induction process a little bit and this sort of… 

00:56:35
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON A little more. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Can you hear me a little better now? Sorry, I need to speakers headed in our direction not yours. Can you hear me? 

00:56:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I can hear you but I'm not understanding the question. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN Sure so, how did you because it was a little more of an informal conversational type of hypnosis, how did uh… how did sort of the induction process work a little bit? How did you know that the trance was taking place? 

00:57:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Okay. I watched her. I watched your face very closely and then when I asked the audience because you said well yeah a little and then I asked the audience because I think well maybe I'm not interpreting and the audience is nodding their heads like this. Okay, I'm not gonna argue with you. And then eventually, you did such a great job. Because trance allows her to communicate with her unconscious and when we are just connected, when we are just connected, it's sort of my unconscious saying to your unconscious, come out and play. It doesn't make sense but you know what I mean. 

00:58:05
LILY Yeah. 

00:58:10
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah. Because in a trance that's a conversational trance, the connection like the best way, I can define it hey, my unconscious without words says to your unconscious. Hey, you want to go swing, you want to go play? And it's an invitation but it's hard to resist. You know, that oh yeah. 

00:58:45
LILY There is not a reason to resist. There is not a reason to resist. 

00:58:50
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah. Yeah. And you know the best thing about this when you learn to do this and are brave enough to do it and practice it? It's energizing because it's energizing. So you can get work done and it's not tiring. It's just, active, you feel it. Do you know what I mean when I say energize? 

00:59:20
LILY Oh, yes, yes. 

00:59:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Yeah, it's just energizing. So that's, listen to yourself girl. Okay, any other questions because it's just about one more question, it's all we got time for. 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN You, you mentioned a couple of times. 

00:59:40
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Put it this way. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN You mentioned at least a couple of times if I remember correctly that in your heart, you cared for all people but in your head… 

00:59:55
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON I love people. I didn't say I care for people. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN You love people but in your head it was different. 

01:00:00
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON Well, of course. 

01:00:05
UNKNOWN So am I correct in interpreting that as letting the person be free because you don't want, you don't expect anything from that person at that time? 

01:00:20
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON There, let me, let me answer this a good, because it's good I didn't make it clear. I do love people, okay. The commonality of untrustworthy interactions with your unconscious knows, yours does, mine knows is that I want something from you and I'm not being open and honest about it. I want to manipulate you, I want to get something, I want power, I want this, I want that. Okay, when I don't care when she, you're in my office now, Okay. When I don't care because she's in my office, I'm saying, win some, lose some. With clients, though I was saying that you but not to you. My clients, I want nothing from them. Except money. And that is freedom because if the only thing I want from you, we both know up front and this is, you go to a gas station, you stick the nozzle and you fill your car up for all you know it's water, milk or kerosene. You trust because most of our interactions, we trust because the other person wants nothing from us. At a green light, you go through because you trust they are gonna stop and the only thing you want from them, it's what's overt for them to stop. That's what I was communicating and that was with you but not with you, it's a useful thing with clients because you work for a week. Well you trust your boss is gonna pay you for all you know, he's gonna say haha, you don't get anything. Then, it's not the kind of inner, it's not a straight forward interaction. He wants something from you, free labor. McDonalds, they put a hamburger in there. Do you understand why most interactions when it's covert, when it's overt, it's stressful then. Covert never is or rarely except for birthday present. That didn’t count. Okay? Okay, because we got to go. You've been a wonderful audience and that's for you. 

01:03:15
LILY Oh, thank you, thank you. 

01:03:15
BETTY ALEX ERICKSON That's for you.
