These demonstrations are for professional training and for use in skills, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped.

Counseling/Coaching Applying professional coaching strategies to the counseling process Allen E. Ivey, EdD, ABPP Jennifer Figliozzi 

00:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Here, we integrate the idea of the coaching profession into the interview process. Counseling is definitely not coaching, but there are some dimensions of that area that we can really find helpful. Uh, we discuss this in our Intentional Interviewing and Counseling, and that is part of our training program. And, as we get into all these influencing skills, there really is a coaching process that goes along. Uh, and I'll turn to Jennifer. I'd like to explain to you a little bit more about coaching as we start. Uh, coaching really is a back and forth, uh, almost a more egalitarian relationship, but the focus is very much on your goals. We don't worry about theory, we, and there're some specific questions they ask, and I think it's going to be a little new to most people. So, I'm actually going to open the book, and I'd recommend that people will also (ph) make this available in a handout. People have, sort of, the structure of a, of a coaching session. Uh, the goal today is in about, you know, 15 minutes at most, to demonstrate a few of the basic principles of coaching. Needless to say, relationship is really essential to coaching, just like, uh, in counseling. And, uh, we're gonna have to assume, to move on a little faster, that we spent some time developing a relationship. And, we've talked. 

00:02:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. 

00:02:15
ALLEN E. IVEY We kind of know where we're going and how it is. 

00:02:15
This is a short demonstration of COACHING'S GROW MODEL. A full hour would be necessary for full exploration. Development MICROTRAINING

00:02:20
G: GOALS: Vision and meaning R: REALITY: Story and strengths O: OPTIONS: Maximize alternatives W: WAY FORWARD: Commitment to action immediately 

00:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh, you've also been kind enough to share the general issue that you'd like to work on. And, just as we, I think we really might begin with you sharing that issue, uh, that you'd like to explore from a coaching frame of reference. 

00:02:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Sure. I've been recently struggling with the, or wrestling, I should say, with the decision to either graduate with my masters and look for employment or move directly into a doctoral program. So that's a, a hefty decision, and, uh, one that I, I'm not taking lightly, but the time is, is approaching where I would either need to start looking at applications for a doctoral program or let things naturally play out for the job search process. 

00:03:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, in a counseling situation I really would draw out, at this point, uh, more of the issue between these two. Uh, but what coaching does, it tends to focus first of all, in the interview, goals. I'd like to know what are your goals? 

00:03:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, what I thought my goals were before entering the masters program have somewhat evolved. But, um, my goals still remain true to, to the initial thought of, of influencing children. I, I'd like to be a school counselor, and, uh, and bring what life experience I have and passion for diversity awareness to, to the schools. So, moving along- 

00:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I hear, I hear that passion for diversity awareness, that in-, that interest in kids, uh, as r-, and I even see a, I love it, your eyes light up in that process as we look at, really, what your goal is. And, uh, I think this is where coaching has some interesting things to say, is if we get an idea of where we want to go, uh, some of the things may fall. Uh, but why does this vision matter to you? 

00:04:30
Watch for coaching's 9 Powerful Questions 

00:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And, by the way, as people practice this particular first time, uh, if you're not comfortable, have the book with you or have a list of questions. But why does this vision of the future matter to you? The passion? 

00:04:40
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, because it will fuel both the drive for what I would pursue in a profession either influencing children or influencing others that may go into a profession with children. And, uh, I think that it's a, it's, it's contagious. When you feel passionate about something, and you love what you do, others, others find that energizing and are able to- 

00:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And I even get a little energy from you as I see, uh, the sparkle in your eyes and you see that vision and that goal. And that really helps me understand what you might want to do. So, that's what they call the goal. 

00:05:20
2. THE GROW MODEL: REALITY Development MICROTRAINING 

00:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And then that's called, and that's also, uh, called a grow model. What's the goal? Uh, let's look at reality. What strengths do you have that'll up you get to that goal? 

00:05:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Um. . . 

00:05:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Tell me about your strengths. 

00:05:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Sure, I think that my strength is, is relating to others, listening to others. 

00:05:45
ALLEN E. IVEY You're a good listener, you relate to others. 

00:05:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI And if I were to play those strengths in a school counseling role, I think that I would be quite an effective school counselor in, in a high school setting, which is what I'd th-, I'd pictured myself doing before I, I've become this far into my masters program. I also think that those could be beneficial pursuing a doctoral degree and, and influencing others in the future that will. 

00:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, a real part of your goal is kids, but you also want to influence others to be. I think you, I sense that same passion of not just you but to bring along other people with this. Aha. And you see that as one of your strengths. 

00:06:25
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I also think I, I, I find learning opportunities in places that aren't necessarily so conventional. 

00:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. And this is what the R of the Grow Model is, it's reality. So, part of the reality is the strengths. And notice, as we do the coaching model, we're not talking to the problem, we're starting with what's your vision, and then what are your strengths? And the next one in the, in the list here, literally, is what is the key challenge? 

00:06:50
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Moving forward for X number of years into a doctoral program or jumping, jumping into a school counseling profession. So, making that decision I'm wrestling with where do I see myself? I think that the, that the end result of either, either path would be drastically different. Although maintaining different components of things that I'm very interested and passionate about, I'd either be working in a school with high school students or I'd be pursuing my, my education further, and, and wherever that may take me in the research. Um, and profession. 

00:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, that you really feel a real strong, uh, strong feeling that this is it, but it still boils down to this decision. 

00:07:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI It does. 

00:07:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So, reality is strengths, uh, part of the reality too is the challenge of making this important decision. But, if we come from the vision, a point of vision and passion and excitement, caring for others and strength, uh, then, to work on the challenge. 

00:07:55
Positive Reframe 

00:07:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, this almost sounds to me more like an opportunity than a problem. How are you gonna actualize the opportunity? How does that sound to you? 

00:08:05
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I think that that, it, it, it is an opportunity depending on how I, I look at it. If I, if I don't view pursuing an education further, or into a doctoral program, as an absence of, um, the role that I see myself potentially playing in a high school, but rather as an opportunity, I think that that sounds invigorating. 

00:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Another reality concern that hits me as I think about you, is there a wrong decision that you could make between these two? 

00:08:40
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I mean, I think that there's time if I were to choose option A, which is what I thought I would, would be doing, uh, going into a school, there's always the option later to pursue a doctoral program. And, uh, and make sure that the fit is, is right and, uh, that I've got a little experience under my belt as well. If I were to go directly into a doctoral program without that experience, although I have life experience in other fields, um. . . 

00:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY But, on the other hand, (inaudible ) the coach, you get experience at internship in practicum. 

00:09:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Absolutely. Which I'm entering next week, and I'm so excited about. 

00:09:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So excited about it. So, that may be another part of your vision and reality is that we know this at this point, but we may know more at a later point, right? 

00:09:30
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Absolutely. 

00:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, maybe we won't finally decide today. 

00:09:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Right. 

00:09:35
3. THE GROW MODEL: OPTIONS Development MICROTRAINING 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I'll also say, from my counseling background, I often felt my best counseling was done, a student would come in with a question and we might resolve that question, but they went out with three more questions, because they saw even more possibilities for them. 

00:09:55
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Right. 

00:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, th-, there's more possibilities. Uh, what are workable strategies, next is O, options, the restoring part. But, what are some workable strategies we can apply to reach that vision, that goal that you have such passion for? 

00:10:10
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, I, I believe what you just mentioned with going into my, my practicum and internship experience, that's a, that's a, an opportunity to really ground truth my, my personal theory of, of what it will be like on the, on the job in a high school. 

00:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's an A number one strategy. What is another strategy that might occur to you, uh, to sort of look at this decision? 

00:10:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Um, speak to, speak to my mentors. 

00:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Aha. Speak to your mentor. And what about school observation? 

00:10:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Absolu-, going into a high school? Or, are you, are you referring to. . . 

00:10:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm talking about, I know that, uh, a lot of people can get a lot from shadowing somebody during the day. Have you ever thought about that possibility? 

00:11:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. Yes. I, uh, I've had one short shadowing opportunity. And, um, and I'll, I'll have more going forward after next week. 

00:11:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, we have several options there, then, for strategies that'll help you make the decision and then it will happen. Now, next one's the easy one for you. 

00:11:20
Explore degree of confidence 

00:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I think I've heard the answer. How confident are you you're gonna reach this vision? 

00:11:25
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yeah, I feel, I feel confident. 

00:11:25
4. THE GROW MODEL: WAY FORWARD Development MICROTRAINING 

00:11:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I don't even think I'm going to explore that any more than I think you've answered it. Just see me smiling. Uh, so we got the G-R-O, we move to W. It's called, "way forward and a will." Are you ready and committed? 

00:11:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I'm ready. Yes. 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And, if we were doing, if coaching weren't going so smoothly and quickly, which I'm glad, because we want to do this short demo, uh, we really would need to explore that issue of commitment. Uh, and, what is the nature of the commitment you have at this moment here and now? 

00:12:05
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Which may actually get at the nature of my dilemma. I, I feel a stronger commitment to my first goal of entering a high school as a school counselor. And I also feel a commitment to pursuing an education, although I'm not, my, my confidence is not, is not as strong in that, that area. So, I've got stronger commitment to high school and very strong commitment to my education currently. 

00:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I also heard another commitment, and that was a commitment to explore and not quite make the final decision til you ex-, explore just a little further, is that right? 

00:12:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. I'm completely committed to the process. 

00:12:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Completely committed to the process. Tell me a little bit more about that area where you're not quite so sure you're committed. 

00:12:50
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Um, about, it, well, the, I think it gets to the absence. I, I was so excited about the idea that this program was gonna take me X amount of time to get through, and when I'm through with my program, I get to enter a school and do the things that I've dreamt about doing. 

00:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:13:10
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Or put into motion some of the things that are happening, um, you know, in my thought process towards school counseling. Um. . . 

00:13:20
ALLEN E. IVEY (crosstalk)Yeah. (inaudible crosstalk ) Okay. I'd like to give you a little bit of what we call feedback, and that is that just listening to you, uh, gives me a feeling of, almost, in my body, a feeling of joy that a person, young person like you is entering our field with that much commitment and passion. I really wanna say that I got a good sense of your goals, I have a good sense of your passion, I got a good sense of your options. By the way, the coaching model, GROW, makes sense. You are in the process of growing. Uh, okay, number nine. 

00:13:50
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY We're almost done. We're gonna make our time, too. Will you do it tomorrow? 

00:14:00
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. This is where coaching is a little sharper, sometimes, than counseling. I make a big stress in counseling on generalization, homework, and you'll see a lot of those tapes on homework. There's this DVD on homework. 

00:14:10
Coaching asks for immediate action 

00:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY But, will you do it tomorrow is really critical. What are you gonna do tomorrow to start actualizing this vision, this passion, this goal? 

00:14:25
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, I actually have an opportunity that will come up, I've got a, a, a meeting with one of my mentoring professors tomorrow, so this is, uh, something that we can discuss in our, in our conversation. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, you're gonna start, right, by talking to your mentor. Uh, I'm gonna ask you for some feedback. What one thing might have stood out for you today from this short session? 

00:14:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I think realizing that it doesn't have to happen, uh, the decision doesn't have to happen tomorrow. That I've got a process that I can go through, opportunities that are coming right around the corner starting next week with shadowing and an internship next semester. So, realizing that the decision doesn't have to be immediate. And giving myself the, the, the time to feel comfortable with all of the different elements. 

00:15:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, now, even though I had the book in the hand and I was looking down, um, how did that feel for you? 

00:15:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Fine, natural. 

00:15:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Fine. 

00:15:20
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yeah. 

00:15:20
DEBRIEFING THE SESSION Development MICROTRAINING 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's really okay to have a piece of paper and you can share these questions with a client. And, uh, particularly until you're comfortable with them I think it's best to have them right there, ready to go. Uh, let's look at this just as two professionals. Uh, what did you notice, what skills, strategies do you see me using beyond this coaching, GROW model? 

00:15:45
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Well, I found that you were really reflecting my, my nonverbals. And I felt that you were very in tune with, with what I was saying and that, where I was coming from. 

00:16:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, in my, in my language I was using observation skills. Of course, it's easy to see the shine in your eyes. Um, when you smile it's easy for me to smile and we call that movement symmetry, is the jargon for that. Uh, did you notice that I used an awful lot of questions. 

00:16:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Yes. 

00:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY How'd you feel about those questions? 

00:16:15
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI I, I felt that they were probing me in the right direction. I felt that they were, I was comfortable with them. I, I, um, also felt that they, sort of, allowed me to see parts of my dilemma if I, if you will, in a, in a different light. I mean, you mentioned practicum and internship, and although that is starting for me next week, I don't think I viewed that as something as helping me towards making a decision. 

00:16:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, okay, good. So, w-, w-, what did, the thing I'd like to point out here is that, uh, I think it's very important for a counselor interviewer to be able to go through a whole interview without asking, um, but, but the total minimum of questions and no influencing skills really important. So listening, at the same time, I want to note the coaching is very heavily into questions. And, if used as an emphasis on a client, client-centered, if you will, uh, coaching can still help a client grow. Goals, goals, reality, which includes stories and strength. O, options, which is restoring, and we did a little bit of what we, in micro counseling, would call a little bit of the new story, a little bit of a new strategies. Way forward and will, W. Action. And you have some action planned tomorrow. 

00:17:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Tomorrow. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, thank you Jennifer. 

00:17:35
JENNIFER FIGLIOZZI Thank you. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY It was great fun working with you. 

00:17:40
