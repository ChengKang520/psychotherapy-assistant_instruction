SHANNON DERMER Welcome my name is Dr. Shannon Dermer. I am Chair of the Division of Psychology and Counseling at Governors State University and today I have Dr. Terri Christiansen joining me to talk about psychometric testing, what it really tells us, and to make it fun and exciting, something that probably a lot of students and counselors and therapist don't think is possible but you are going to help us with that right Dr. Christensen? 

00:00:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I will do my best to help everybody with that. 

00:00:50
SHANNON DERMER Tell us a little bit about yourself Terri. 

00:00:50

00:00:50
Assistant Professor, Governors State University 

00:00:50
Division of Psychology and Counseling 

00:00:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I am an assistant professor and I am also a dually licensed school and clinical psychologist and I have worked in that capacity for 18 years and then currently teacher at the university. 

00:01:05
SHANNON DERMER At Governors State University? 

00:01:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah at Governors State. 

00:01:10
SHANNON DERMER You got to get your university in there. You worked hard to be assistant professor. But for 18 years before that you were really focused a little bit more on clinical work and in your clinical work I imagine you do a lot of psychometric testing. 

00:01:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. That's a key part whether I have worked as an advocate in the schools or when I worked in the schools as a school psychologist right after I left graduate school and then certainly as part of my clinical practice that comes up as part of my work. 

00:01:40
SHANNON DERMER Well I know you also teach like research and statistics as well as a lot of clinical classes. You are one of those professors who does both, often you do one or the other, you teach a lot of the research and testing and things like that or you teach a lot of the clinical courses, but you teach both. So what is your usual reaction from your students about psychometric testing? 

00:02:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN The usual reaction is one of feeling overwhelmed and intimidated. I think when numbers come into the mix, there is a natural tendency to for those of us in the counseling or psychological profession to get a little bit of overwhelmed and intimidate, how do we interpret at, what do these numbers mean, we are dealing with numbers how. I think there was a study that was actually done looking at counselors and psychologists in training and how many of us often times put off our statistics course until the end because of the anxiety that we often feel around it. 

00:02:40
SHANNON DERMER Well you know it's been – I had remained in college many years ago who she was one of the few people who I knew who was really good at both. She was actually majoring in math education and was a psychology minor. She was great at the verbal stuff and that conceptual thinking like that and then also really good at the math skills, but not everyone can do both. They tend to be better at one of the other and I find that a lot of psychologist and therapist and counselors tend to be a little bit more at the verbal conceptualization part and not as a good at the math although there certainly are people who are good at both so yes sometimes there is a bit of fear and anxiety and procrastination when it comes to learning research methods and statistics which I think are both important to have basic knowledge in those in order to understand psychometric testing. So you want to give this test without understanding why and how it works. 

00:03:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. In terms of really being able to utilize those instruments and measures in ways that support our conceptualization and being able to I think look a these instruments that have been administered and what they are telling us and do those support ideas that we are seeing do they open up other avenues of thinking and our conceptualization or how we need to approach treatment and it can be a very helpful tool for moving forward and what it is we are doing. 

00:04:10
SHANNON DERMER Right so you don't do testing just to do testing, you do it as integrated part of assessment and intervention and also to see if you are achieving some of the goals that you want to achieve. It can be all parts of therapy account. 

00:04:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. There is different ways that we can use those instruments and it can be as formal as somebody going in for a full test battery. It can be as simple as somebody coming in with depression and measuring that depression within measure and then during the course of treatment revisiting that measure to see what's been happening in making the game. 

00:04:50
SHANNON DERMER Right. Okay. Good and so really it's not just like clinical psychologist or school psychologist who use psychometric testing that the typical counselor or the typical therapist can also integrate those into their work but they should know some basic ideas so if you teachers had on for a second what are the basic concepts that you think people should know in order to understand psychometric testing? 

00:05:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Some of the basics are being able to understand what those numbers mean also being able to as we think about selecting measures what measures we want to utilize, we need to be able to look at things along the lines of is this the measure that's going to get, that's a reliable and valid measure for example and being able to understand what is good reliability which maybe in that ballpark of looking at point 70 and when we are looking at those numbers in the manual we need to be looking at those pieces and saying standards have kind of been defined where we want to be up in the 0.8s and 0.9s to have good better and we can have adequate around points 7 but if we don't see those reliability it's probably a measure that we should not be considering to use. 

00:06:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Good. So there are lot of different measures out there and one of the first things you need to do is look at is this a reliable measure and it should have at least a 0.7 or higher but on reliability measures but 0.8 or 0.9 would be much better. And just real briefly what you mean when you say reliability? 

00:06:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN We are talking about when we think about reliability we can think about that in terms of our day-to-day use of reliability, am I reliable, does that mean you can count on me. Is it dependable, is it going to if I utilize this measure and then I retest again am I going to see a similar – is it going to hold. If I give the measure and you give the measure and we are both working with the same person, do we come up with the same type of score? Those are some of the considerations we are thinking about is just do we get a consistent score overtime. 

00:07:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay good and then you also mentioned valid I believe. What do you mean by validity? 

00:07:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So we want to make sure that if we are saying something measure something that it does in fact measure what we are saying it measures. So we want to be looking at if I am saying I want to be measuring for example intelligence I don't want it to be looking at something like their score achievement. Does this really measure intelligence in terms of how we think about intelligence and how it's defined according to a theory perhaps. 

00:07:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay so you are making the point that like maybe just because you don't perform well in school you don't high student achievement doesn't mean you are not intelligent. There are lot of intelligent people and we go to some famous examples Thomas Edison, I think Einstein all of them didn't necessarily perform well in school but were brilliant, very intelligent. 

00:08:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:08:00
SHANNON DERMER So you want to make sure test wasn't assessing school achievement versus intelligence if it says it's measuring intelligence. 

00:08:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think another things that's very important consideration and as counselors when we are using these measures another key thing to be thinking about is who was this task normed on. 

00:08:20
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So like say a little bit more about that. What does that mean? 

00:08:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So when tasks are developed and when we get our task there is always those little booklets that a lot of times we see a lot of language and number so maybe we try to tuck it away and we are not necessarily attending to it but it's very important if we are using a measure so that we are being culturally sensitive, so that we are – if we were measuring somebody who has a particular disability or challenge that the measure we are using is sensitive that it has been normed on others in the population. If it's been predominately normed on white individuals using that type of measure with a minor client would not be appropriate. It's telling some different things. It needs to be based in representative. 

00:09:10
SHANNON DERMER So it's not that it. I mean, it could be valid but we don't know if it's valid with groups that wasn't tested on. So you wouldn't want to use something that was normed on adolescence with elderly or older adults. It may or may not be valid on a different population so for lot of test you want to see that it was tested with a lot of different groups if you are going to use it with the general public and if not then you should really only be using it with the people it was normed on. 

00:09:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:09:40
SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:09:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That certainly I mean if we make a decision to utilize an instrument that wasn't normed on that group we need to be very, very cautious in our interpretation on what we are talking about based on how we are reading those numbers. 

00:09:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay. so it's not that you can't necessarily but you need to be very cautious and careful about interpreting the results if it hasn't been normed with that population. 

00:10:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:10:05
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Good. What else do they – so you said reliability and validity and who the measurement was normed on. What else are some basic researcher statistical concepts that the average counselors or therapist of psychologist should know? 

00:10:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think what we want to be thinking about are things like a lot of times the numbers that come up through the measures that we use are things like standard scores. We get percentile ranks. We make a great equivalence ad sometimes you hear that term based rate that – 

00:10:40
SHANNON DERMER I am sorry just checked all those statistical term not kidding. I was one of those people with the anxiety with statistics. But I have realized overtime how important it is so okay so breakdown what some of those mean. 

00:10:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Well those start to tell us when we are using we can talk a little bit about norm reference test and if a test is norm referenced or standardized actually if it's a more standardized test what we are seeing are we are pulling some specific scores and those scores help tell us how that individual compares to other individuals in their age group, or their grade level. It gives the specific information in terms of where they stand. Are they doing better than 75% of other. 

00:11:30
SHANNON DERMER A lot of school tests are like that you scored on the reading, you know, 75% of better, you know, 75% you scored higher than 75% of the rest of the third graders or something like that. And so that's normed based. It's comparing you to someone else at a similar level or age or experience. 

00:11:50
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. And I think those even those numbers can be very intimidating again going back to the dreaded technical manual often times those scores are defined within the context of the manual where we can see what exactly if I am looking at this range of scores is it what is it telling me. 

00:12:10
SHANNON DERMER So those are norm reference. What about the other scores that you talk? 

00:12:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So other types of we might be looking at for example a criterion reference test. A criterion reference test is different in terms of what we are looking at is does somebody, are they achieving a certain criterion. So for example if I say I am going to do an advance placement test those are often criterion types of test and what we are looking at is is that person actually achieving a certain criterion as oppose to how maybe they compare to other students. 

00:12:55
SHANNON DERMER Okay what criterion might be like a licensor exam or an advance placement test like you have to reach at least 80% of something like would that be a criterion? 

00:13:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. That would exactly. That's a good example. I think also looking at I can think of some of the scales that I have used with children where often times we look at certain developmental levels and those developmental levels where we might see that they have achieved this level and this is consistent with being at a certain age level. 

00:13:25
SHANNON DERMER Got you. So you know a two year old you have a certain number of words in his or her vocabulary if they are on typical development or three year old might have would have a different criterion of how many words should be in his or her vocabulary if they are on a typical development path. So that would be the criterion. 

00:13:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:13:45
SHANNON DERMER Okay. Great. What else? 

00:13:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think aside from, I think we can think about personality measures. Those are really interesting and often times we counselors and psychologists love to look at these personality measures and there is different types. There are object what we call, objective, personality measures and projective personality measures. 

00:14:10
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So an example of the objective personality measure? 

00:14:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN In objective test we can also are looking at the objective test if we see things like true/false, if we see a rating scale, if it's multiple choice and there is a standardized way to score it. So everybody is taking that that same way. A projective test is much more ambiguous and that might involve me the ones that's most common one we tend to think about and talk about is the Rorschach and where that's presented and it's a very unstructured approach I am not selecting… 

00:14:50
SHANNON DERMER It's like the ink blot, the ink blot where it's like some ink thrown on a piece of paper and I am supposed to tell you what I see when I look at it. 

00:14:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. 

00:14:55
SHANNON DERMER Projecting myself on to it. 

00:15:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN You are projecting yourself on to it whether it's a picture, whether it's an ambiguous type of ink blot and you might see a lady bug and I might see you know a dog eating a person. 

00:15:20
SHANNON DERMER You are projecting too much of this. So I don't need to be well trained on that one. So it's a much more it's not just true or false you know, it's more supposedly at the person and kind of who they are and what they are thinking rather than just being subjective and then you fit this pattern of other people who have these issues or these strings. 

00:15:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Scoring isn't quite as clean cut and there can be variability in terms because what we pull out of the person's responses can be based on what we are seeing the themes and patterns that stand out to us. 

00:15:55
SHANNON DERMER Now I believe it is inter-rater reliability important with more of those projective type test that like two people might come to similar conclusions if they are given the same results or answers on a projective test? 

00:16:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That becomes something very important to look at with those types of test. Often times we see lower levels of reliability and validity with those types of test because it can be impacted by where somebody is at on the given day and how they are responding. So we tend to see changes. And again because there becomes a bit more subjectivity in terms of how that test is interpreted or scored. 

00:16:40
SHANNON DERMER Like I am thinking for like school psychologist, they might go in and do observations of a child and one way to increase that I might see the same and come to the similar conclusions as you might if we are both observing the same thing is to do some training on that test and to try to increase our inter-rater reliability that if I see a kid hit another kid that we both rate that the same way. 

00:17:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:17:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. So that's one way to increase that is that through training so that we are defining and getting meaning to the things that we observe in similar way. 

00:17:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. I think it becomes really important obviously things that can affect test outcome and performance are… it's a two way street. It can be very much situational aspect of the person that we are testing. So if that person comes in fatigued or if there isn't a good report with the examiner there is various variables that can come into play with how they are working through the test and how they perform on it. Similarly… 

00:17:50
SHANNON DERMER So they are not perfectly objective. It could be that if they had a bad day and is performing worse on that test than he or she would otherwise. 

00:18:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. Similarly though another consideration becomes the examiner themselves and things that I talk about with students are becoming it's a process of becoming proficient and the administration of those test it requires a great deal of practice and training and ongoing practice and training because otherwise the measure is only as good as our effectiveness to utilize that. 

00:18:30
SHANNON DERMER So if it's something that you are giving the client not only does the test itself influence the outcome but the research or the person who is assessing it, the clinician is also part of that process, is also part of the measurement tool so I can depending on the instructions I give influence how someone does on the test depending on my attitude I can influence, but then also I think you are talking about in the interpretation the person who is interpreting it can also influence sometimes the test results. 

00:19:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Certainly. I think we want to really think about a lot of different variables when we are thinking about how we are interpreting those test scores. Not only was that adequate reflection, was the person performing in a way that we think we got the adequate or true snapshot of their functioning, but we also again I think want to be taking into consideration things like cultural or disability types of pieces that may come into play. If you have hearing difficulties and I give you a test that's very verbally loaded what I am assessing is not really your verbal ability I am assessing your hearing deficits. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER So great, yeah that's why it's important to do multiple types of assessment. So yeah if you are giving verbal ques like repeat back how I spell this test to my memory but I can't hear you very well then you are not testing my memory, you are testing the fact that I can't hear you very well or same thing with something visual if you give someone a puzzle to do and you are trying to see their abilities for what like special memory, you know, that you are not really testing that if they are having visual problems and can't see the picture on the puzzle. 

00:20:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah and I think as counselors or psychologist and a really key piece to be paying attention to when we are looking at a score that we are not using that single score as the definitive way that we are looking at that person. That can become very misleading and misguiding. We want to make sure that we are looking at multiple measures so that when we are drawing a conclusions that if somebody is saying "Well, I gave this depression scale and I believe so and so is depressed," how are we seeing that on observations what do we come up within our interviews, what are other measures possibly showing to support that. 

00:21:00
SHANNON DERMER Great. So multiple pieces of information I believe in research they call that like triangulation that if you do things in multiple methods with multiple ways, with multiple measurements and you come up to similar conclusions that you can have a lot more confidence in that conclusion. So it's never about giving someone just one measurement, it's about using your observation, it's about using multiple sources of information as well as maybe multiple measurement or psychometric test. 

00:21:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. I think when we are looking and that to me is the fun of doing the testing. I love the clinical work, but I love the opportunity to utilize that data to say, "Yes, this fits the picture that I have been forming or here is this interesting piece that I hadn't considered." I also think it can almost be a clinical intervention in of itself because often times when you are sharing results with clients or children telling them somebody who maybe has struggled with the learning disability that they are very intelligent. It becomes very much therapeutic type of moment where they are getting that information about themselves and having new insight. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER Yes so that can be an intervention in of itself. Well thank you so much for sharing that all the information. Hopefully that helped everyone and you will be doing a demonstration a little bit to help bring all of that home. 

00:22:20
ASSESSMENT & TESTING: 

00:22:20
PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS- WHAT DO THEY REALLY TELL US? 

00:22:20
SUPERVISION SESSION 

00:22:20
with Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:22:20
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:22:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Hi, Jahaan. 

00:22:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Hi. 

00:22:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I am glad you are able to come today so that we could have our supervision session and I know you have been a bad under the weather. 

00:22:35
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah sorry about that. 

00:22:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN You are feeling okay? 

00:22:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah. 

00:22:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. So soon you are going to be and starting on some opportunities to utilize some testing yourself and I know what we were talking about was looking at a sample report that I had written recently and giving you a chance to look at over a bit and ask some questions that you might have specifically around the testing process so that we could look at that as you are preparing to do that yourself. 

00:23:15
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah I do have a few questions. The first is how do you begin to prepare for the client? 

00:23:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. Well when I received the referral requesting the testing typically what I do is I obviously reach out to the client to schedule the appointment and the initial of the session that I set up with them is very much geared around the diagnostic interview where I can not only develop report with them but also get a sense of why they are coming in for the testing and what they are hoping to get out of it as well as educating them a little bit about what the testing process looks like, what they can expect from it and how they can best be prepared for it. umm… I also, once I have had an opportunity to meet with them well usually ask them to sign a consent for so that I can talk with the referral source and get a little bit more information specifically from them in terms of why they are referring the client for testing and what specifically they are looking to tease apart and for what purpose. That becomes really important information to making decisions about what instruments are going to given during the evaluation. And it's important I think again during that first meeting for some of the business aspects of things that maybe come into play whether it's understanding how much the evaluation would cost and handling some of those ethical components round the payment for the service and also just in terms of getting a sense of how I am going to get the best performance from that individual. Some people might prefer to come in and work straight through for a five hour window. Somebody else depending on what's going on may need shorter structured sessions so that when I am administering the test I am not testing their fatigue or their exhaustion. I am getting their ability on a particular measure that I am trying to get at. 

00:25:30
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Okay. Another question that I had was how do you choose the instrument that you are going to use with the particular client? 

00:25:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. Good question. In the case that you look to at and in every case for that matter part of it depends on what the referral source is looking for, what the client maybe looking for. In this particular case there were needs that the client presented with and there were needs that the referral source, the treating therapist had wondered about something's diagnostically that they were trying to tease apart and some of the issues that we were going on were does this client seemed to be presenting with a thought disorder or were some of the problems that we are going on related to substance use, or was it coming about as a result of some other types of issues, was it related to the depression that they were seeing in treating. So they had some diagnostic questions that they were looking to get a sense of. They also wanted to support the client in terms of this was an individual who was planning to go back to school after a departure and a long time I am not having been in educational setting. So they wanted to get a sense of what their thinking and reasoning skills were and what their academic skills were looking like specially in the complexity of what might be going on with these other emotional types of problems that we are presenting, getting a handle on that what types of support might that individual need when they get into the college setting so that it could be supportive that way. 

00:27:35
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Okay. Another question that I had was for people of color in assessments working with people of color and not just people of color, but minority and people who have not necessarily been normed with those assessments when you run into a situation like that could you maybe talk to me about how I could navigate that a little bit better. 

00:28:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah those are difficult circumstances. I mean, I think, our first task becomes to try and find assessments that actually have been normed on we have come a long way fortunately. That wasn't always the case but it's to try and find instrument that actually have been normed on people of color and that they have been included in the sample so that we are getting an accurate look. Now one of the things that I think is important to take into consideration is even if we do find an instrument that has been normed the other question becomes there still are in any testing situation, any therapy situation, there is always a bit of a power differential with the clinician having more power than the client that's how it's often felt. We work to resolve that but obviously in a testing situation, testing can feel very intimidating and somebody coming in and what their thoughts might be about their abilities in a certain area can often times begin to impact what they are thinking about themselves as they approach that. So very important becomes issues of building report in that respect using empowering language. Sometimes even thinking very carefully about the words that we might choose to talk about what the test is actually measuring so that we are not increasing a feeling of threat or vulnerability around this test taking task that can often times be so overwhelming for a lot of folks, 

00:29:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Yeah that was going to be my next question actually working with clients and how to help them to be a little bit more comfortable with the test taking process using empowering language. Would you suggest mirroring the language that they use to help them to feel little bit more comfortable? 

00:30:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely to the degree that it still creates a level of authenticity. 

00:30:20
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:30:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN But I think, I think it can be important often times what I will do in testing situations is I think back to circumstances where I have been in the position of being the examinee and that how the level of frustration and the concern about my perceived abilities are. So I will talk with people before hand and say, "You know, I want you to know these tests are geared in a way that nobody gets to get all of it correct." And what you are going to find is that some of these tasks are going to be very easy for you and it's going to be a natural and that you are also going to encounter some task that are going to be a little bit more difficult because it's tied in within an area of growth or challenge for you and that is typical of everybody. So when you find one of those areas try not to get too down on yourself, just keep doing your best. Eventually the way these tests are designed is that you are supposed to hit a ceiling where you can't go any further and you know, that's not reflective of you not being a really sharp cookie. 

00:31:40
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Okay. One other question that I had was when you have done the assessment and you are – when you have done the initial assessment and you are looking for an assessment tools to use what if you have determined that there are two or three really good assessments that might work well with the client, how would you best determine out of those which one to use? 

00:32:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Oh my goodness! Things that I typically do is I go back to looking at the reliability and the validity of the instrument and also who the test was normed on. So in other words, for example if I am wanting to do some personality assessment then one of the things I might want to look at is this somebody that's currently in treatment and is the group that this test has been normed on people who have also been in treatment. So those become considerations. Various test also have different degrees of reliability and validity. So a degree it can also become about which of these is the best in terms of it's technical adequacy. Another issue to think about becomes the client themselves and we may have the same type of test for example different personality measures and some of them are geared at six grade reading level, whereas another one maybe geared at an eighth grade reading level, one of them may take two hours to take and another one maybe able to be complete it within 30 minute window. So a lot of times what I will do is think about what I know about this client and if something that takes us as long as two hours possibly to complete is something where I am going to want to make sure the person is motivated and comfortable and that I am not going to start to tap into their frustration level or their distraction and shut down around that particular task. 

00:33:50
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Okay. That helped me. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. 

00:33:55
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN You are welcome. 

00:34:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH One other question that I had was working with individuals with differences. Is it okay to identify the difference and offer maybe solutions to taking being a part of that assessment for example, someone who is perhaps illiterate and that came out instead of playing to the… okay. you don't have to take this, you don't have to encouraging them saying, "I can read it to you, you could…" 

00:34:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN That's a great question too, Jahaan. So many of the test that we use are often times standard, what they call standardized test and standardized tests have to be administered in a very formal type of way in order to have the interpretation be reflective. So I love your question because part of it becomes we try to adhere to standardized procedure and once in a while because of a circumstance so that we encounter it maybe that we find that the individual isn't able to complete the measure at all and so we say okay we are unable to complete it. It maybe something where in the case of somebody who has a specific challenge and again maybe it's a visual impairment or something of that nature, part of it becomes how do I make some accommodations with the material and then it is a deviation… what they call it deviation from standardized administration, but it still becomes some useful information it just needs to be interpreted in a way that we are keeping in mind that we deviated that way. So we are including that information in our write up. But we are trying to take what we can get from that information. 

00:36:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. 

00:36:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah. I am wondering too did you get a chance to look at the recommendations in the report? 

00:36:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH I did get a chance to get a look at the recommendations. Some of them escaped me right at the moment but I wanted to find out how do the recommendations connect to the test results? 

00:36:25
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN So when we get back to this idea of looking at these numbers and what do these numbers mean and how do they fit together in terms of what we are conceptualizing is going on, part of what we want to do with that data is that data becomes very helpful information to connecting what the recommendations that we are looking at. So for example, in the particular case that you have reviewed, one of the things that was going on, there were multiple pieces that were identified in the testing process around the issue of depression, around the issue of possible thought disorder, and around the issue of substance. So in looking at the data there was you know, there was measures tended to suggest that all of those pieces were in fact going on for that individual and that drove specific recommendations and thinking about the hierarchy so to speak of what would become first in terms of importance to address. Obviously the issue of targeting substance issues is incredibly important with somebody who is experiencing a thought disorder because that can actually exacerbate the thought disorder and it makes it difficult in terms of you know, psychopharmacology management where we are looking at medication as a possible way to treat. So we are thinking about those recommendations in terms of the complexity that comes from those instruments and how that all fits together to support the therapist who is going to be utilizing that information to drive treatment. 

00:38:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Thank you. That was helpful because I was thinking when talking about recommendations with the client sometimes the client is focused on alleviating what they feel is most harmful or most uncomfortable at the time and unfortunately many don't think that substance abuse is a major contributor or something that needs to be dealt with first. Most people want to feel better, like I am feeling very very depressed, deal with that first. What would you suggest for me as a counselor to redirect the client to what is a better fit in terms of the order of what should be treated? 

00:39:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think very similar to what we do in the context of our sessions is a similar way that we integrate the results that come from an evaluation. So the client maybe very focused on, hey, I want to feel better in this regard and part of it becomes educating them around different variables that we have identified through the assessment that can be contributing to that. Looking at the realities of those pieces they still get to make those choices and decisions. Part of our job then becomes to help them understand how we may not be able to get where we need to go if we don't address certain things that are going to, you know, again medication isn't going to be effective when substance abuse is in place, it's going to render that ineffective and possibly make the condition that they are suffering from worse. 

00:40:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Indeed. Indeed. Thank you. That clears a lot of thing for me. 

00:40:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN The other thing that I want you to be thinking about is you are looking at some of the measures that you might be using with folks that you are counseling, Jahaan, is to think about even though you maybe administering a single instrument, I want you to keep in mind that that instrument in and of itself isn't the be all and done all as it were that it gives us some supportive information that we can use to umm… you know, bolster what your initial impressions were around that if it's something to include with the interview information with umm… you know, various pieces that maybe you have collected in other capacities reports from parent or something of that nature but we always want to keep in mind that we don't want to be driving a diagnosis or a decision just on a single measure. It's important to keep in mind that with testing it's a snapshot. It gives us a snapshot of a behavior and we can look at it as part of a larger puzzle and assembling that puzzle with different pieces of information that we have. 

00:41:25
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Got it. Would you suggest using more than one assessment with the client? 

00:41:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN I think sometimes we definitely do want to consider that depending on what the measure is and depending on, umm… you know, how uncertain we are about it in another capacity. It can certainly be helpful to pull in other measures to, to look and say do we get the same thing that we got previously and that can give us a little bit more confidence around a direction that we are heading. So I think were we feel fuzzy about something it's helpful to give multiple measures. 

00:42:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. Okay. 

00:42:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. 

00:42:10
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH And explaining to the client that this is just part of it, part of the bigger picture is something that can be reinforced throughout the process? 

00:42:20
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. And that I think it's also one other very important thing that I want to you hold on and walk away from the session with is this idea that we don't want these scores to define those person. Somebody who looks at their achievements scores and says okay this means I am only the smart and this is the best I can do, no, no, no. We want, we want our clients to know that we are capable of change in terms of everything from our thinking skills to whatever mood, types of challenges we might be experiencing. That is all open to change wit intervention and support. 

00:43:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH Okay. 

00:43:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. That sounds good? 

00:43:00
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It sounds great. Thank you so much. 

00:43:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN You are welcome. I hope that was helpful. 

00:43:05
JAHAAN R. ABDULLAH It was. 

00:43:05
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay great. 

00:43:10
ASSESSMENT & TESTING: 

00:43:10
PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS- WHAT DO THEY REALLY TELL US? 

00:43:10
WRAP UP 

00:43:10
with Terri Christiansen, Ph.D. 

00:43:10
Division of Psychology and Counseling, Governors State University 

00:43:15
SHANNON DERMER So, Terri, thank you. You did a little demonstration a marked session with a supervisory or someone who is playing supervisory and you were coming at it from a supervisor perspective of preparing someone to use kind of testing measurements in their work with clients. 

00:43:30
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Correct 

00:43:30
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So what was it that you wanted to get across your supervisory? What were the main points that you wanted her to learn from that supervision session? 

00:43:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Okay. I think some of the things that I felt were really important to drive home were considerations around testing for example the idea that if we utilize the test that we don't hang her hats so to speak in terms of driving treatment on just that single measure that we need to look at it in the context of a variety of information that we have gathered but utilize it as something important that can help guide us in a more objective way rather than just working off of our intuition. Another piece is thinking in terms of the types of measures that we select and being smart about using measures that are actually been used or normed on the population that we are going to be giving it to, you know, we don't want to be giving something to somebody who hasn't been part of the norming sample when the test was being standardized and developed. It's important that they be in that mix so that we can make some reliable judgment calls from it. Another consideration is thinking about ethical and cultural considerations from selecting our measures. For example if somebody has his specific challenge or disability we want to be sensitive about what it is we are giving them so that we are again staying true to what it is we are trying to measure as oppose to measuring something completely different such as their frustration level or that it's somehow, you know, sending a very insensitive message and something that's dis-empowering and possibly harmful. Those are three that come to mind. 

00:45:35
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So really you want to make sure that what because I think sometimes test hold this magical thing in our society in anyways here in the United States maybe in western society you know, like you will see testing cosmos and you will testing like all these sort of things and students think, "Well, oh if I take this we are now in Facebook and all of those things and take this test," which Disney personality are you, things like that. They hold this kind of magical quality for us and then specially in like some of the mental health fields where it's kind of driven home and some of the in CACREP standards but also the other ones while you need to know research and you need to know testing and measurement and reliability and validity and it's on their licensor exam some of those things that I think it takes on this quality of like what the test is it must be true but you are trying to drive home the point of a test you know psychometric measure is one piece of information that should be part of a much larger pool of information. 

00:46:40
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. It doesn't become the be all in all. It should not define it and it's something that we should be working with in terms of some of our own thought processes with the case that we are thinking about. A lot of times hopefully it's validating what we have been thinking already and if it's not then that becomes important for us to look at as to why was it the measure, did I miss-score it, what might be going on here, why does this look so different. 

00:47:10
SHANNON DERMER Or one hypothesis is that diagnosis that I was considering or the case conceptualization that I was considering was it off because this test doesn't fit in with it or maybe is there something off with the test because it's not fitting in with the other information that I have collected. So the other thing that you mentioned was kind of related to that of picking a good measurement, picking good test, I remember reading a long time ago that really about I think it was some astronomically high number like 98% of the measures that are out there have never been used more than once because people who use them in their dissertation or was in one study versus things that have been used for many years and many different people like the WISC, the WAIS, the MMPI, the Beck Depression Inventory, but you had to be just – you had to be careful of just pulling any old measure you want to make sure that it's been tested a lot with a lot of different people on appropriate populations. 

00:48:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. That's where we can say that taking some of the statistics courses comes in handy and as much as it make us nervous again part of it is just really going in and looking at those numbers to say are they following in this range of acceptability or how solid is it. You know, We are looking at certain numbers that's telling us this is adequate but… 

00:48:35
SHANNON DERMER It's reliability. 

00:48:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Yeah, yes, it's adequate but then there are others where we can say "We have got a good deal of confidence that this is going to reliably measure what it's saying it's going to." 

00:48:45
SHANNON DERMER So you want to look at reliability scores and make sure that those studies have been done with that measurement but also you want to make sure it's been done used with a large enough population, but also diversity so you can generalize it to a lot of different clients. 

00:49:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:49:00
SHANNON DERMER And even if it hasn't been that's doesn't mean it's not a good measure but you want to be more guarded with that, with how you… 

00:49:10
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN More cautious in terms of the conclusions that we are making based on that instrument. 

00:49:15
SHANNON DERMER Good and then I believe the final piece that you had said was you want to be careful with diversity, diversity if physical abilities, of mental abilities, with different populations in the values and experiences that they had that that whatever measurement you are using fits for them and is an accurate representation of whatever it is that you are measuring. 

00:49:35
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. There are some measures required as I mentioned in the demonstration at certain reading level and so giving something to somebody whose reading levels isn't quite there sets us up to really get some secured information. Also we want to be making sure that the language of the instruments is sensitive. Umm… that it's something that's really attuned to whoever it is we are going to be administering. 

00:50:10
SHANNON DERMER And then I think this is one that you mentioned when we were originally talking about test and measurement but you didn't mention a moment ago was that actually that the instrument is measuring what we intended it to measure as far as if it's something anger that you are actually measuring anger and not, I don't know frustration that those things may overlap in some ways or sometimes two things may not overlap and it's easy to assume that something that's measuring anger is actually doing that when they haven't had the research behind it actually maybe measuring something else. 

00:50:45
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Absolutely. 

00:50:45
SHANNON DERMER You have to be careful and then what about we really have a little bit of time left, but using your theoretical model to choose measurements and what measurements you should have, you want to say anything about that? 

00:51:00
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Umm… periodically that comes into place but I think buy and large at least based on my training, part of it's become I mean that may drive in terms of as I am conceptualizing the case and what type of information I need that may drive that the selection of the instruments a bit more but probably not as much the instruments themselves. Most of the instruments like if we are thinking the area of the intelligence we are talking about the WAIS or the WISC we are looking at instruments with which the examiner has familiarity that they have been trained on and that they are familiar within well equipped to use accurately that tends to be a bit more important I think… 

00:51:45
SHANNON DERMER Than their particular theoretical background unless it's something that like I don't for my theoretical background work with attachment I am not likely to choose an attachment measure however you had talked about I think that you had talked about that you are psycho-dynamic in nature and that you do look at attachment so it might be important for you to pick that measure when you are assessing someone versus if that was not a major thing for my background, theoretical background, I wouldn't pick to assess that. 

00:52:15
TERRI CHRISTIANSEN Right. I think exactly, I think that notion that are theoretical orientation can drive and sometimes that's where it's helpful to consult with colleagues who maybe looking at things from a different perspective and say here is something else that might be helpful to pull that type of information that you are looking at because otherwise we can be driving at bed instead of saying open to the information we are trying to gather. 

00:52:40
SHANNON DERMER Good. Well thank you so much for sharing at least I think it's important no matter what to know how to do testing, but it is important from accreditation standards also that we know how to look at a psychometric test and it's basic psychometric properties and that we know how to choose something, that we know how to do it in a respectful, meaning way to our counseling process or a therapy process and to our clients that we pay attention to their diversity and how our testing process may impact them. So thank you very much for sharing your knowledge. Thank you for all of you for joining us today for CACREP Essential Skills for Counseling Practice and I hope that you learned a lot about how to use test as one piece in an assessment package.
