CBT & Grief 

00:00:00
Dr Frank Wills 

00:00:05
FRANK WILLS My name is Frank Wills. I've been a psychological therapist for over 40 years now. And during the last 25 years or so, I have been practicing as a CBT therapist. As my practice has gone on and developed, I become interested in the, uh, Sometimes had criticism of CBT, that it does not have a very full approach to working with client's emotions. And I found it necessary to expand my view and my interest in order to work with client's emotions, in a way that I found more helpful and satisfying, and seem to work well with the clients as well. Well, one emotion that can come up or, or series of emotions are those surrounding grief and bereavement. And it's about those that I want to talk about today. And frankly, there has been comparatively little coverage of the issues around grief and bereavement in the CBT literature from my understanding of it, at least. And this is in more ways, a little bit surprising because umm… if we go to the theory of CBT, one of the great contributions that Aaron Beck made in particular was to establish various cognitive themes in issues like anxiety and depression. And in depression, the cognitive theme was held to be loss over defeat, so that would seem to naturally map on to, uh, grief. And indeed, there is an overlap between, uh, grief, grief and depression. So this morning, I want to, uh, think, think together with you through the ideas of how CBT might address the more complex emotions that can arise with, with grief. And umm… we'll be suggesting a sort of framework that we might begin to, uh, start to think about this. Uh, but past before we focus on the issue of grief per se. Just a quick word about the history of emotions and how we think about them in both psychology and, umm… as a psychological therapy. And there has been kind of been, umm… several movements in the history of ideas around this which have suggested slightly different relations between how people think and how they feel. And at some points in that history, the idea of mastering emotions by working on the way you think about things, the position we often associate, in particularly Stoic philosophy, and has been a strong tradition. And indeed, probably did influence the, the start of, uh, a CBT when, when that began to develop in the early 1970s. So, so the, the mastery model of emotions, you can be seen a little bit in the, umm… approach to depression. For example, we identify various negative thoughts that people have, say about themselves, you know, I'm rubbish, I'm useless. These are thoughts that seem to come up quite regularly with depressed people. And we seek to umm… teach the client to argue back against these, these ways of thinking. Uh, and in that way to kind of uh, master the, the feeling of depression or sadness which, which actually comes with them. But this, uh, arguing back against, uh, feelings and thoughts probably has some limit. So I think that became fairly obvious, relatively early in the history of CBT. So that the more nuanced approach to emotions has begun to develop. Uh, for example, with the idea of accepting emotions and that's particularly clear, umm… with something like anxiety because, umm… quite a lot of clients you will see when you, who are suffering from anxiety will be struggling to start try and suppress those feelings. And, uh, sadly, there seems to be a bit of a bounce back effect with that which actually enhances the feeling of, of anxiety. So sometimes, it's important to, sort of, talk back at, umm… emotions, in a sense argue with, argue with them. Uh, but also sometimes, it's, it's important to accept them as well and, and indeed those two steps are mutually, uh, exclusive. Yes and sometimes it's necessary to accept the feeling. And then, perhaps, a little later, begin to, you know, uh, question it or, or challenge it, uh, little bit more. So, and we can see how that could be problematic with something like grief. Because it's, it's an almost universal approach in grief that we encourage people to talk about and to recognize how sad they might feel and the loss they feel. And with even, uh, evidence in one of Shakespeare's plays Macbeth, where, umm… one carried the umm… urges another to give feeling words to express their feelings, or actually grief at the, at the loss of a son, in that, in that instance. So culturally, I think it's quite well accepted. So the idea that you would argue with your feelings and thoughts about loss and grief, you know, probably seen culturally counterproductive. And indeed can seem a bit disrespectful of the person's experience. And I certainly, in my role as a teacher in those times, umm… was aware of grieving, umm… your grieving clients go in to particular, uh, bereavement agencies. And, uh, sometimes the agencies would be very nervous about CBT therapist working there because they considered that that kind of approach could be, umm… disrespectful, umm… to, to their clients. So of course, umm… I've already referred to the (inaudible ), you know, I've been a therapist for many years. So I, I'm… although, uh, clients tend not to come to me with grief as the primary problem, I've obviously seen quite a fair number of clients, uh, who have, umm… had, had been through those experiences. And I'd like to talk about some of them. And to talk about a CBT approach, one of the few bits of… I… what I've found congenial writing about this, I… I've got a book. It's, uh, Overcoming Grief by Sue Morris. So it… What I'm gonna say, oh, it's quite a lot to, to have framework. So I'd like to begin just by talking about, umm… three clients that I've dealt with. And then I want to kind of introduce you to Sue Morris's framework. And then talk you through that framework with reference to these three clients that I've dealt with, some of them are actually relatively recently. So the first one is Peter. Now Peter was, umm… a psychiatric nurse, actually. And he was, umm… extremely laid back. Umm… and if I tell you that I work from home. And, uh, the first time, I greeted him at the door, I actually thought he was my window cleaner. Umm… so casually was he dressed? Uh, and umm… at the time I saw him, he, he lost his wife, Sharon, about a year before. And that first thing to cope, reasonably well with that, he said. Umm… but had become quite depressed around about by the time of the referral. He himself was around the mid '50s and Sharon, his, his, uh, deceased partner was slightly younger than him. And also quite a different personality. She'd been quite a fiery person and one could imagine that the mix of those two characters probably led to quite a lively, I think, sat… very satisfied marriage. Umm… she'd had a major illness. And in the end, she died rather suddenly. And the couple had three children aging between 17 and 22. And one of the things that was happening was, uh… there was a little bit of a problem in the house that the children were helping to look after things and they seem to me, that the whole family was kind of grieving in, basically, in their own rooms. So that was Peter. Umm… Vicky was, umm… a 30, a woman in her '30s. She was married and, and was, was actually expecting a baby and had, umm… at first, in her presentation, there was actually nothing to do with, uh, grief, whatsoever. It was a fairly typical case of OCD and worry. In particular, she had a lot of obsessions around, uh, sexual thoughts and she, she would, umm… spend a long time, uh, obsessing about various own sexual indiscretions she had over her life. And was very worried about whether it was going to lead to the breakdown of her marriage. Umm… and the issue of grief didn't really, uh, come up at all, until well into the therapy. And I'm going to mention that, little bit later. And finally Morris, Morris was a professional man and a, a lawyer. He was, umm… he just retired. In fact, he was in his early '60s. And, and at the time I saw him, his wife was alive and she was, she had a fairly serious, uh, a medical problem with cancer. And, and he was very anxious about health and about all kinds of other things that were going on in their life. And his present, presenting issue was how to handle this, umm… anxiety. And during, during, I actually saw him for about a year, in the end. I didn't see him weekly. And it's sort of the what periods, uh, of weekly therapy and then would be the gaps and so forth. Umm… and during this time, there were, there were a couple of periods where she'd been very ill. Uh, and then there was a remission. Umm… but actually, sadly, eventually, during that time that, uh, she, she died. And so I taught him both about the anxiety that she was going to die and then about the feelings he had around her actual death. Umm… so if we… And those are the, the three clients I want to talk about. Partly, 'cause they illustrate different things that I think I've learned from, from this kind of work. But let's just turn to, move into Sue Morris's, uh, fr… uh, framework. And what she does is she kind of takes some of the earlier approaches to grief. That's, umm… I'm sure many of you will be familiar with. And there have been basically two, umm… two strands, I want to focus on that. One is the idea of the stages of grief and this goes back quite a long way to the 1960s. People like Kubler-Ross, umm… and, uh, Colin Murray Parkes, except for to write and suggested there was a series of stages that people went through when they, umm… experienced grief. So typically there would be shock and numbness to begin with. Umm… followed by, umm… you can more, more sadness and depression. And then often a phase of anger, before finally moving towards more of a resolution state. So there was… and there were various variations of those. Umm… but, some they had a, sort of, commonality to them. And then there was another approach which was made particularly well-known by the writings of William Worden which suggested that there were tasks of grief which kind of matched, matched out with these, umm… three different stages of grief. So that the first thing… and anything was to accept the reality of the loss. Umm… and then later moving towards, moving on towards building a new life. And umm… what Sue Morris does, she used to kind of put these, umm… two things together into a series of tasks. One other thing that she would mention that too is that, umm… there's been a, a more recent, umm… series of ideas about grief which have suggested that perhaps we over did some aspects of the earlier theories. You know, particularly the ideas, it was necessary to, to talk a lot about grief and to kind of work it through. And what the newer approach has suggested is that is true for some people. But the other people actually manage, mange grief in a different way. And, you know, they, umm… manage it bit by becoming more engaged or more busy and so forth. And the problem with our original position was we intended to see those people as an, kind of, annoying a bit, whereas now I think, we see, well, there is a range of ways that people, uh, you know, uh, respond. Some people do find it really helpful to spend a lot of time working for the emotions. But others legitimately want to kind of get on with their life. And probably everyone has a balance of those two things. I think that was a helpful clarification actually in the sense of, it allowed us to allow people to deal with grief more in their, their own particular way. But the, the, umm… phases that Sue Morris mentions are these, first of all, it's important to, umm… help clients tell their stories of grief. Secondly, it's helpful for them to establish routines in the new situation, you may recall I mentioned, umm… Peter, the man with, uh, children, umm… living in the house, umm… and they found a routine. They have been rather lost because of the loss of their mother. So reestablishing something that can be a helpful, because it can act as a base around which to deal with other issues. And then there's the whole issue of dealing with barriers to grief. Umm… a lot some… All of us tend to have slightly different emotional rules. Some people, for example, think it's selfish to wallow in your grief and so forth and this can be a barrier to them, working through some of the feelings, uh, of it. So we think it's quite important to deal with those kind of barriers. And then umm… one thing that begins to happen is, uh, bereavements and situation move forward is that, uh, one tends to go through of… a series of situations that Sue Morris called firsts. You know, like the first one that I think, will mean, everyone will get in the first time you hear your partner's, your deceased partner's favorite song, for example, will be something which will have a big emotional impact on you. But there's also the first time you go out to places that you went out with them and this extends to, you know, the anniversary of the death and so forth. And we generally tend to think the first anniversary of death is quite an important period. Umm… and then finally, there's the whole idea of you build… slowly building up new perforation kind of moving on. And… but at the same time, perhaps, you know, retaining, umm… the grie… the, the lost person somewhere in your own life, you're, you're not, not, umm… totally erasing them depending on exact quality of the relationship you have with them. And so let's go to the first of those things that Sue Morris mentions, helping clients tell their, their stories of loss and grief. And, umm… I quite like the idea at which I've come across now in literature, the idea of the three part narrative. In the three part narrative, which is a very common strategy by playwrights, novelists and so forth, there's often a, a situation. We begin the story with a situation of equilibrium and then something happens which makes the equilibrium loss, so we have disequilibrium. And then the dis… the disequilibrium itself produces a process which results in a resolution as it worth. We get those three distinct phases. I think you can often see that quite clearly in many clients stories actually, but, but probably in, in grief, a lot. And, umm… I, I see some residents here with the interesting theories which have been developed around trial. Because I guess the loss of a partner, you know, could be defined as quite a traumatic event in many ways. And, umm… in, in trauma, we, we know that people become very disorientated for a while. Umm… and that, umm… what's often seems to help them is to, to be able to tell their story in a feeling way. Uh, uh, and there's a very famous trauma therapist called Bessel van der Kolk. And one of his most famous papers which is now been turned into a book is called "The Body Keeps the Score." So these memories are often, like, are kept in the body. Uh, and can be expressed through an emotional retelling of, of the trauma story. This is a very common feature and to, to actually all the approaches that we have to watch trauma and whether the cognitive behavioral psychodynamic or whatever. Their idea of telling the, the trauma story in a, in an emotionally, umm… grounded way. So, uh, one… I'm just telling that to the client Peter, I talked about earlier, the man who'd lost his, uh, wife and was having some problems with, uh, his children. And… As I, as I referred to earlier, he was very sort of laid back, uh, man and very pleasant and… Umm… but at one stage during while we were talking about the events that surrounded his, uh, his, umm… his wife's death, he expressed a number of quite angry thoughts about the way she'd been dealt with, by the medical system and some of her doctors. And he remembered, he himself was a, a nurse. So he had a particular understanding of, you know, that from both sides of the, the argument as it were. Umm… but as he talked about this, umm… and bearing in mind that, umm… he has actually also expressed some quite strong feelings of irritation with his children. He actually finished that section of, of, of therapy by saying, "Still, it's no use being angry. Is it?" And that to me signaled a bit of a… what we might call emotional schema. And when I asked him about it, he confounded by saying, "Yeah, I don't do anger." It's a, the, sort of, thing that people say quite often which kind of indicates that emotional rules to you. And I thought, I might suggest something else. And I suggested to him, perhaps there was some value in anger, sometimes. And indeed, within the theory of grief, it's sometimes been argued that when clients become angry, it's actually part of them moving on from the immobilized sadness, there's energy and movements in anger. Umm… and I was, uh, interested in his reactions. Because he was kind of like, a bit of an aha moments. You know that he… I could see this, that this had an impact on him, when he began to talk about his, his childhood experiences in relation to this. And it turned out that his father had been an extremely angry man. Umm… but his mother, as a way of coping with this, went to the other extreme, was very passive accepting. So one might think from that that maybe what he didn't have in his childhood experience was a, sort of, a model of reasonable anger. You know, the benefits of anger, using anger to be assertive and so forth. And so we began to talk about this. And, uh, it was something he seemed to move very quickly on. Uh, he began to talk about his children. And in my therapy room, I have a whiteboard. And I often find it's useful, you know, to get clients to write stuff out there that they're talking about or I will write up stuff that they are talking about. And it seems to allow a little bit of, uh, the, ability to see what you're talking about, you know. And maybe begin to develop a new relationship with it. And what we did on this board was, I, I drew an arrow from the top to the bottom and I was say that that's the grieving process, where would you put all your family including yourself on that. I mea, he was very quickly, did that. And basically, uh, he put his two sons right at the start of the process barely started, as it were. His daughter in the most advanced position and himself between, between the, the, the, the three of them. And so that, that just looked such an interesting, umm… map of where they were at. And I felt it, just in that moment, he was looking at that, the anger, sort of, found somewhere to go. And he kind of said to me, " You know, really, we're grieving about this separately. Aren't we? We should be helping each other with this. And from that discussion, I can't remember whether it was, whether it was actually achieved in that session, but soon thereafter, he moved to the idea of having a kind of a family meeting in which he put all this, umm… on the table. And indeed, uh, things started to move forward quite a long way and after that. So, uh, we can see from that then, that the family meeting might, where he might have been able to say things like, hey! Come on, you guys, you should be helping me out more on getting the house tidy. We should be eating together more, this kind of thing. That's because until the second area that, umm… Sue Morris mentions about routines. And we're talking about just very simple routines here. Umm… because after all, umm… you know, that even in our deepest grief, we still have to attend to some business, you know, getting dressed, eating and just generally trying to, umm… deal, deal with issues that that come up. In fact, I, I recently, umm… sadly attended a funeral of a relative of mine and I was talking to my, my cousin, that she is, wife afterwards. And she was telling me how difficult she found it to deal with the amount of paperwork which had been pushed out. And this was actually on the other day of the funeral, so not, not many days after the, uh, the death itself. There's a lot of kind of things that still have to be dealt with, no matter how you feel. So routines is helpful from there. And, and there is a, a good tradition within CBT, all of this, you know, that, umm… because there's a similar issue often with, uh, depression, you know. People get immobilized and they don't attend to things that they should be attending to and taken too extreme, they don't even get out of bed in the morning. Umm… and so there's a, there's a technique which is used that called activity scheduling, where well, you get the person to make a chart of their week and, and first of all look back at what they were doing before. Umm… and then try to slowly build up on that, slightly more step by step proactive engagement. Umm… and this was the reasoning that is very good because when people are depressed they become withdrawn. And I've already earlier said that one of the problems that goes with depression is the amount of negative thinking that people do. When they become withdrawn, in a sense, it just gives them an awful lot more time to do that thinking. So it's very good to, sort of, engage them in, uh, in your simple tasks. And it's quite a nice activity to do with a client. Just want to go to one of my other clients that I mentioned earlier, that was Morris. And, and I would say it was something that cropped up between him and I, where we actually saw something differently. Umm… and, umm… without being, I hope, overly directive, I actually put a, an alternative point of view to him about this. And this was that, umm… although he'd retired, he was still engaged in some very interesting, umm… educational work, you know, just on the part-time basis. Uh, and I got the feeling talking to him that, umm… this was quite a, a quite very close to his heart. And he, he'd actually set up a few things within this education which were very meaningful to him. Now at the height of this and I'm talking to him when his wife was actually still alive, his anxiety was so great that he wanted to give, give this up, at a time. He wanted to stop doing this work. And in essence, I wondered what the effect of that would be? I wondered if it might just dislocate him further and, uh, push him further into the feelings actually. And I suggested, maybe we, we should think about whether it might be possible to kind of hang on in but maybe reduce what he was doing. Umm… and as it turned out, it was, it was, it was quite an, uh, an important period because … In fact, he was actually on the process of, umm… winding down that work and had he completely stopped in the way that he wanted to, he would have, he would have not brought that work to a proper end. And so in the end, I, I did, I guess, persuade him to hang on in there. And it had a very good result because I mean, it resulted in, in a very nice (inaudible ) piece of work. And then in fact the people, uh, had their formal dinner to say thank you to him. And, umm… it was, you know, a nice feeling of completion of that work which I think was very helpful to him. So these, these kind of things, they have, you know, they can be… appear quite simple but they got a very deep meaning in, uh, in with them. The third, uh, stage in, uh, Sue Morris's approach is to deal with any barriers that they may be to grief. And at this stage, now I just want to turn straight to my clients, umm… Vicky, who, you remember, uh, was a, ostensibly presenting an issue of, uh, of OCD with the not uncommon, umm… aspect of, uh, of sexuality involved in that. And, umm… this is a time when I was really thinking very seriously in my own practice about emotions. And I, I had actually taken some ideas from some of the more emotional focused approaches actually. Umm… the ideas of emotional scheme as that I mentioned earlier, the emotional rules that people have. And I was trying to, umm… explain this to Vicky. And I was trying to explain the, umm… perspective that, of the fact that she was concerned about these sexual feelings that she had probably pointed to something that was very emotionally valued to her. Umm… and I was making the case that, umm… that although these emotions like worry, and anxiety, and sadness, and, and anger to some degree, can seem very negative. Actually, they probably have healing value within them. Uh, and I referred right to the start about how, umm… probably the most culturally accepted version of that, is of grief, you know, that we feel worried actually about people when they don't show signs of grief for this. And I thought that would be a good illustration. And so I merely said to her, umm… for example, if we think about grief and I'm not… I got no further than saying those few words to her, when she suddenly just absolutely burst out in tears, floods and floods of tears. And it took me quite a while to, sort of, bring her, bring around again. I'm not someone who wants to stop her crying but, you know, bring her to the point where she could open the dialogue with me again. Umm… and to tell me that she'd have these very serious losses, umm… which had dated back about three years. Umm… and this in fact, umm… the, the principal one, the loss of her mother, immediately preceded the onset of the OCD. So we were in very relevant territory here. And for a while, umm… we switch down to talking about obsessions and talked about her grief. Actually not very long, after in my memories, it was probably just a session or two. But I did feel that something was a little bit cleared for. And that, umm… and that it was connected with, with the, with the OCD in some way that I'm still not entirely clear how, but was pleased that we've been able to capture the range of emotions which were in that issue. I think the thing that I took from that, in terms of my own development, and again it's a point that's made, you know, in emotion focused therapy particularly by Les Greenberg who has written a lot about this and said, actually emotions tend to slip around alone, you know, we tend to have these tight categories that result in depression and so forth. Actually, they're slipping around a lot all the time. And I think, I think maybe in CBT, we particularly borrowed those tight categories and I think we have stuff to learn about how they can slip around and interact with each other. That, that was something which came to me, in that particular instance. Umm… a fourth element now, uh, that I referred to earlier was the issue of dealing with, umm… the first time that that things, uh, crop up. You know, like songs, umm… birthdays, Christmas, anniversaries of the loss of, of our, our close one. Obviously, one issue that is, whether the person ever started to think about another relationship. And that, actually this did come up in, in, umm… the, the two clients, who did actually lose their, their partners that time looked, looked at. Umm… so you remember, I was, umm… telling you about, umm… Peter, coming up to, umm… hold a family meeting and just before that time, which would have now been about two years after his wife's death, he kind of, uh, had an invite out, I guess on a date. I mean, it was quite a low key thing. It wasn't necessarily, very clearly, you know, aimed at establishing an intimate relationship. Umm… but there was a kind of slight twinkle in his eye, if I am right, put it that way. And I felt that some thing had, important had happened. Umm… but it was actually not long before the second anniversary of his wife, uh, death. And he told me that he felt, you know, sort of, uneasy and guilty about it, he wasn't sure whether to accept the invitation. He hadn't actually accepted at, at that, umm… stage. And the issue of what he did about it was one which I think very bravely, he decided in the end to include in his discussion with his children about what was going on with him. And the way it worked out was they were very, very affirming of it, of, you know, him actually, you know, going along with that, if he wanted to, they felt. And they expressed that their view that, that would have been what their mother would have felt, hence. Actually, so he did actually, eventually, not straight away, I think, it took him another month or so, before that actually happened. Umm… and indeed, I believe in the fullness of time that relationship has now developed into a, a partnership relationship. Another, umm… thing that along those lines, umm… which was very deeply moving thing, to me. And I think, shows, you know the kind of depth, that you can't actually reach in CBT which sometimes, umm… it can, it can appear stereotypically cold or not very emotional. But, umm… Morris told me at one stage, this is when he'll again, when his wife was still alive, that she'd actually said to him that she wanted him to kind of promise that he wouldn't have another relationship after she died. And, uh, he was, umm… older than Peter, he was 64. And, and he found this actually quite shocking and disturbing. And, umm… and yet when I was talking with him about it, I, I couldn't help but feel a, sort of, some admiration for his wife's fierceness as it was. I think as I put it to the time, just the fierceness of the, uh, a love that wanted someone to make that, that promise. I, I felt, I could understand that in some ways, that might have, not look admire it, not necessarily agree with it but there is something about to each of them, I found very deeply moving. And, umm… I, I felt that, I may, I instead of kind of I didn't want to be passive and just reflect back to what he had said to me and I actually, actually told him what I was really about it. And we had quite an interesting and quite deep discussion about that the nature of love and relationships. And it felt like something quite important to have been said there. Uh, and by the way, the end to the story was that, umm… eventually his wife did die. And he told me in the end that she, she actually released him from that promise. He did not own that. But I felt that was one of the moments, uh, you know, where, which I think many of you will recognize what you feel, just feel deeply privileged to witness that, uh, uh, of deep things going on in someone's life for all, you know, that, that life with their partner. And the, the final thing that that, uh, Sue Morris mentions is this idea about helping clients to, you know, build new pathways. But at the same time, you know, retaining that partner in their life in some kind of way. And we can already see that beginning to happen in the last two things that I, I've talked about where people where beginning to think about the possibilities of, of other relationships. Umm… and the reorganization that was going on within the family. And I think that our therapist role is not to tell people to do those things but to, to act as, as we often do. Umm… as a sounding board, I think the CBT perspective is very relevant to it because people may well have negative thoughts and expectations about, umm… about doing or about moving on. Some people feel guilty about moving on as if it's they're being disloyal to their, their partners. And, umm… people tend to happen to deal with that in different ways. Sometimes I've, umm… with other clients, not in these particular three I have been talking about today, but, umm… it's been helpful for the client to have some kind of ritual where they, you know, visited a grave or visit a spot. Umm… as, as part of, as part of that moving, moving on process of explaining to their partner, you know, an imagination about where they were at with their life and why they were going to sell the house or maybe engage in a new relationship or a new career or whatever it was. And I think, you know, having dealt with a number of clients, umm… who have been through that, I think, we can be in a very good, uh, position to help people think through the, the, the pros and cons of various options, checking the way they are thinking about it. And indeed, maybe try a little behavioral experiments, trying some things out, some in, in new kind of ways. Okay. So, uh, I hope there have been all to lay out, a kind of whole, umm… series of moves which can present a framework for dealing with people who are grieving or who are bereaved or suffering losses is probably expendable to, umm… to other situations of loss, as a matter of fact, I do some work with sports people. And quite often, I might be dealing with a problem where, uh, where the client is in a danger to the point where they may be having to give up the sport and they tend to go through. I see recent stats much along that lines, that we were taught. So it's probably quite a wide range of issues that could be, umm… thought about in this kind of way. And I think I've been able to show you, umm… both the stage and the task model, in fact the, the, the framework I have given you, combines, I think, the stages and the task in quite an interesting way. And I've, I've mapped that out in the article which I have, which goes along with this particular, uh, talk that I am giving. Umm… and I think the, the relevance of CBT has been demonstrated there in the sense of the (inaudible ) the ability to be sensitive to the negative beliefs that kind of rise in the process. And also, the, the, uh, behavioral tactics, which can be useful to enable moving through the processes and the moving on. Of course, what's missing there, in that the, the cognitive and the pavement is the emotion. Emotion is key, I think. And I think, I've been able to demonstrate how an emotional awareness, uh, is essential, really to, to making this process work really well. You know, the, the emotions I think, I want to make my, my final thoughts on this, to deal with those emotions actually. And to me, what's very evident, you know, looking back at the three clients I've described to you, is how crucial the emotions were around the turning point of, of the, the, umm… the helpful processes that were a part of the therapy with those three clients. So for example, recognizing and legitimating Peter's anger, and looking at a way of harnessing that anger, harnessing the energy that goes with anger into some kind of a, a more positive engagement with the situation which definitely to hit, happened as he began to, you know, sense demand a little bit more from his family in a, in a, in a legitimate way and recognize his own angry feelings. Uh, then, then we have the moment which was crucial in the evolution of the work with Vicky, where, was done simply, umm… dealing with anxiety, and obsession, and worry. Uh, to the point where I'd seen her for quite a while then and was not aware of her, her, her losses being significant and yet suddenly that being released into the session. The crucial emotion, which I think had been lurking around the edges of everything else, and when we allowed it to come into the room, when we allowed ourselves to look at it, then looking at that kind of lubricated the other one too. Finally, with, umm… Morris, uh, was the, the very interesting, umm… idea of, umm… that although I was looking at someone who was losing somebody and eventually lost them, during the time that I worked with them. And that the, the main focus was anxiety. And yet the anx… the loss was, it wasn't being anticipated as anxiety. What became evident to me in this, when we actually came to the loss and his reaction to that was very, I don't want to say positive, because it, umm… makes it sound wrong, but it was very healthy. And really, uh, we didn't have a lot of work to do at that stage. And he continued to see me for a while, just checking in but tended to report, uh, nice stories of the grief well, well conducted, you know, with his children, and his friends and so forth. And I believe that is because, in part because, we sort of because we'd anticipated that loss so much, in the earlier part of therapy dealing with anxiety. It actually facilitated the grief, in a way which it wouldn't had we not, not dealt with that. So again, umm… you remember I told him, uh, in the struggle my work with Vicky of how the emotions switch around and slip around. And that was another good example, I think, of how, umm… the, the, the emotions kind of slipped between anxiety and sadness and grief, in the case of Morris. So I think the conclusion to read from that is that we can have a systemized ways of using CBT methods even in something like grief, they can be very relevant. Dealing with the negative thoughts that arise dealing with the, with the be calm(ph) behaviors. And, uh, but we need to do so in a way that's emotionally ground. And that essentially has been my message to CBT therapists for so many years now, which may be, might be summarized as once again, but with more feeling this time.
