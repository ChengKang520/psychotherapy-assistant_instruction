ISSUES IN MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT A Microtraining Series Reflecting on Life Experience: Using Erikson's Model in the Interview African-American Perspective Onawumi Jean Moss interviewed by Allen E. Ivey This tape demonstrates Erikson's theory used to help client's understand how their past relates to the present. This tape is not therapy, but reflecting on life experience can be therapeutic. 

00:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Today, we have an incredible treat for you. We have Onawumi Jean Moss, Dean of students at Amherst College and a nationally known storyteller, is going to share with his, her reflections on her developmental past. In this particular series, we're interested in looking at how well does Erik Erikson's theory fit people from varying backgrounds. We have another tape in the series, for example, with Norma Jean's(ph) turn and explores with being a Jewish-American has met throughout her development. We're looking here at the individual. Erikson looks at the individual as kind of the be all and end all. Ah, this tape seeks to demonstrate, the series of tapes seeks to demonstrate the individual's development of families in cultural systems. These are people in context or selves in relation. We'd like to respect Erikson's theory but the same time suggest it doesn't always fit. There's a real need to bring in issues of gender, culture, and family history as well. Enough of me, I'm not trying to stay out of the way for the most parts of this tape. Onawumi Jean Moss. 

00:01:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Onawumi, it's totally a delight and honor to have you here today. We'll be looking at Erikson's tape, as you know. 

00:01:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, Erikson's theories and we're going to see how they fit and don't fit with people varying backgrounds. (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:01:35
Conconstructing the interview 

00:01:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah, we'll be making a transcript to this tape and, ah, anything that you say or, or rather, or rather, you'd rather have taken out of the tape, we will take out. 

00:01:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  So you're kind of the final control of this. People find this experience as useful for life reflection and looking at their own story of their life. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You are Onawumi a master storyteller. So we're really interested in learning some of the stories of your life, but I hope you allow us to, to relate a little bit to Erikson's theory along the way, which you know as well as I do. So, ah, any reactions to that before we start? 

00:02:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS No, I'm just very pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this. And, ah, going back to Erikson's theory, revisiting it as were visiting my own life,- (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - is, is an interesting thing to do because I've never have done it that way. 

00:02:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:02:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:02:25
Trust vs. Mistrust 

00:02:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, as, as you well know, the first stage is trust versus mistrust. 

00:02:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And one thing that we're suggesting in this, the individualism of a family in a cultural context as- (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - before we get into you personally, if you could just tell us a little bit about the family, ah, situation in cultural context in which you were born. 

00:02:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, just tell us a little bit about that. I mean, often as useful, not everybody has a birth story but birth stories are often important part of the trust versus mistrust issues. 

00:03:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I was gonna turn over to you and occasionally, I'll be asking questions. 

00:03:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uhm, I was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee. 

00:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmn. 

00:03:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I stayed there for the first 18 years of my life. 

00:03:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmn. 

00:03:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I was born in 1936. I have no qualms whatsoever about saying that today I'm 60 years old. 

00:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmn. 

00:03:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And uhm, was 60 back in, in, in December. And so, uhm, when I look back at my mama, my daddy. 

00:03:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmn. 

00:03:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uhm, and that was the beginning because my mama and my daddy were married after, ah, her last husband died. 

00:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:03:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So my oldest sibling at that time was 10 years older than I. 

00:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:03:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so I was the first of that union. 

00:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ah. 

00:03:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And, uhm, born in '36 in Tennessee was a precarious, ah, undertaking for Black family. And I could have been statistic because at my birth, I was unable to breathe - (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - independently. And, uhm, my sister, Gladys, who has, uhm, God bless her soul, was 20 years older. 

00:04:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:04:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, then I, ah, was there with momma and you couldn't be born in a hospital in Tennessee because we were colored. That's what was said at the time. We were colored, and coloreds couldn't go to the hospital at that time, so you're born at home. And, ah, doctor birthed me with the help of my sister and a midwife. And when it was discovered that I wasn't breathing and wasn't responding to the slaps on my bottom, ah, I still don't respond to slaps on my bottom but, - (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. (Laughing). 

00:04:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - he had to leave in December in the death of winter to go back to his office and get whatever medication was necessary. 

00:05:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS To start my breathing. In the meantime, my sister, Gladys, had to give me exercises so that I would keep the fluids going and hopes that it would save my life. 

00:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:05:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So that was my beginning in Jackson, Tennessee, and when you say, "Oh, what does that do?" It makes you ambivalent- (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - about a lot of things, but not about my sister Gladys. 

00:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:05:27
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My sister Gladys was my lifesaver at that time and so, uhm, she and she'd stayed a hero in my life for a long time. Uhm, so that was my beginning and whatever trauma. 

00:05:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:05:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, produced that, that respiratory problem, uhm, I seemed to have outgrown it. 

00:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  For the most part but from time to time would have breathing difficulty. 

00:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And nobody ever called it out as interesting. Nobody ever called it, ah, asthma. 

00:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ever. It's just that you are having some difficulty. 

00:06:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Interesting. 

00:06:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, I probably was, in some ways, marginally asthmatic. 

00:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, but it was never named then. Uhm, but there were times when you would just be very tentative about things and you were protected. I was protected, that you couldn't do this. Ah, no, she can't do that. No, no. You can't do the other, and when you hear can't a lot early on in your life, your, your inclination to be trusting. 

00:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  In a, in a sort of gentle natural way. 

00:06:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:06:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Is altered. And so, what I learned to be, though, when I wanted to do something was aggressive. 

00:06:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so I was that was how I persisted in getting some of things done that I wanted to get done, even as a little child. So I became a very, sort of, what some people would, would call precautious child. 

00:07:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You see, but I had to break through the "I can't." Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
Early patterns continue through life 

00:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, you said, so, in effect, the, the balancing of the trust and mistrust worked on the way one way for you being aggressive and yet- (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - you feel this tentativeness ah, sometimes, and you know. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. Absolutely, absolutely, I persisted for a long, long time. 

00:07:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And you're saying that, ah, your family was going through some very difficult economic times. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Oh, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Can you give me one example what was going on in your family at the time of your birth? 

00:07:35
Individuals develop in family/cultural context 

00:07:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, well, during that time, that was toward the end of what was, what is known as the "Great Depression." And, uhm, Blacks in Tennessee, my reading has, uhm, has found, my research has indicated that Blacks in Tennessee were mostly uneducated. About 900 people in the, the black people in the whole state would be, would get their high school di, diplomas, ah, per year, and there were plenty of Blacks in Tennessee but you, you didn't get an education very easily. The average pay of, for those who were working was three dollars a week. And the, the most prevalent jobs would that of servitude. 

00:08:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My mother was a domestic and a field worker. And she wasn't working in the houses of rich White people. She was working in the cotton fields or the strawberry patches. Wherever there was money to be made. And so, and my dad worked as a janitor in a lumber yard. Now, I didn't know at that time that he was a, a, a janitor. 

00:08:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Because just as it was never said that I might have had asthma, it was never said that Daddy was a janitor. 

00:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So some things were not said. So, in that time, the economic picture for Blacks was very, very bleak. 

00:09:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It's very bleak. And my family was an absolute reflection of that bleakness on the economic level. 

00:09:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Not at all are reflections of the bleak, bleakness, though, on certain spiritual levels. 

00:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm 

00:09:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You know, that's where the optimism was left intact was on the spiritual and religious level. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. So, so the trust and not just had some spiritual dimension to it. 

00:09:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It has so much spiritual dimension because you were taught early on that Jesus loved you. 

00:09:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And that became a kind of, a kind of mantra. 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS In your life. 

00:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Is that, that no matter what else was going on and whether you could, we came to the world breathing whether or not Jesus loved you. And, uhm, and that was where you put your trust. Early on, as a little child, you will say your prayers. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. As a prayer that none of us knew came from England from a time when children were so ill, there was nothing to guarantee that they would wake up. That prayer had made a transition into America. 

00:10:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And became a part of a little Black girl's life in Tennessee and a lot of colored children said that prayer. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, well am I-, I've couple of response of that I reminded of, ah, myself in Sunday School as a child that,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, as there was Jesus loving the children. 

00:10:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:10:30
ALLEN E. IVEY  Red and Yellow, Black and White,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS All of the children of the world. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - all the children in the world- (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That also, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - precious in his life. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Absolutely. 

00:10:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, for some reasons, that mantra I think was, I think, was real important one for me. 

00:10:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And I've always, I've always wondered on how churches can be churches when their children are raised of that particular song. 

00:10:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY His powerful dimension 

00:10:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS He's very powerful. 

00:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So trust comes from spirituality? That trust from your, sister. (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My sister, Gladys. (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  Your sister, Gladys. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Saving my life. Yeah. 

00:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And those are kind of emblematic of trust of, of the key foundation of trust in your life. 

00:11:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And the, and the extended family. 

00:11:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And extended family. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Extended family can and adopted can or so surrogate can. 

00:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:11:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  You know, so neighbors. Apparently, my whole street knew we lived at that time at 264 Westchester and it was lined on, once on both sides with houses with Black families in them. 

00:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And one of the Black families who, uhm, sort of took great interest in me was Mr. and Mrs. Finley(ph). They have no children. 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And Mrs. Finley(ph) called me Precious. 

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:11:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So the song, "They are precious in his sight." 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, how nice. 

00:11:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS She reinforced that by calling me "Precious." 

00:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uhm, and I grew up with that sense of being somehow special, one because I breathe when it was possible that I might have died. 

00:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And the other because for Mrs. Finley(ph) and others, I got this reaf-, reaffirming kind of approval. 

00:12:10
Trust develops in families and social context. Spirituality is often more important then recognized in counseling and therapy theory. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt 

00:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  I'd love it the more stories of trust and, and rather than stop, I think, a sort of flow in it becomes naturally- (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ALLEN E. IVEY 'Coz you are saying dealing with the, some of these issues became aggressive. Or Another way to say aggressive is autonomous. 

00:12:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And ah, Erikson's next stage, autonomous versus shame and doubt, and I'm sort of wondering it might exploit concept of autonomy, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - 'coz I know aggressive is one way to say it. 

00:12:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY But you also said aggressive in the sense of prides. 

00:12:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:12:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm wondering where that takes you because you started to introduce that Eriksonian stage. 

00:12:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uhm, When I looked at that stage and, and, ah, uhm, of my, of, of, just flowing, you know, from one stage to another and carrying with you baggage from all of those stages, uhm, my, my mother and father both had to work. They had to work and be away a lot. 

00:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uhm, early on, I was kept by two Black women, uhm, Aunt Maymie(ph) and Mama Edna, Aunt Mary(ph) and Mama Edna. Mama Edna was the tiniest little person and I think the oldest person in the world at, at that time, she seemed so old but she was, oh, so very, very kind. And we would be taken there to them and Mama Edna, who was not educated, took care of me in those early years. Now, what she would do is deal with my exuberance. 

00:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS By taking me up to the train track, which was just really at the front of their house across the street and teaching me about trains. 

00:14:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm. 

00:14:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS The IC Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, went through. And, uhm, that railroad track played a large role in our lives and Mr. Cavit(ph), one of my neighbors from Justice Street, was the engineman. He was the person who put the coal in the engine so that the steam would continue to go and the train could be powered. And she helped me to understand, when I wouldn't sleep. 

00:14:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And, (Laughing) and they, and they couldn't get me rested, she would help me understand when Mr. Cavit's(ph) train was coming in. 

00:14:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:14:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS When his engine was coming in and it was Engine No. 11. 

00:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:14:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, at long about dust when I needed to be resting and she couldn't get me settled down for anything and mama was off working, had come from the fields, perhaps and gone to work in the evenings. Mama Edna would walk me and I could say and right now, I can feel her jostling me on her tiny frame. 

00:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Trying to comfort me because I would rub my eyes to keep from going to sleep. So she taught me about the trains and I knew the train schedule and almost who was the person on that train. Who was the engineer, as well as who was the ah, person who was feeding the coal. That was at the, at her house, at home. I would turn anything into a project. 

00:15:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You couldn't run off and play very, very casually because everybody worked and there was strong rules about whose house you could and could not go to. Even Mr. and Mrs. Finley's house, I couldn't go to it because they didn't have children and there was fear I would break something because I was so nosy. I was whatever picking something up and looking it over and turning it around. And Mama didn't want the embarrassment of having me - 

00:15:55
Roots of creativity and autonomy 

00:15:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - going unsettling Mrs. Finley's(ph), absolutely, neat house. But I would take corrugated, ah, cardboard boxes and where the ideas came from now, I'm not entirely sure. We didn't have magazines, but I would make up houses-. 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and cut windows and I'd looked out the, the favorite houses on the street, of if we had gone driving with someone we didn't own a car and I'd say one of these days, I'll have a house like that. Whatever house that was, apparently, I would memorize it- (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and come back and reproduce it on this box. I would take all pieces of, broken pieces of crayon. 

00:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:16:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And draw flowers around the edge of the box so it would have a garden and I would, uhm, cut a door into the house and put knob, and windows and everything and put windows with shutters on this box and take odds and in, sometimes it wouldn't spools a thread, ah, uhm, bottles that I'd put corn silk in that made dolls and make a whole families for these houses. 

00:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So in- (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - your name, Onawuni, it means- (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It means one who is creative and loves creativity. 

00:17:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  So your name - 

00:17:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That Onawumi was working then (Laughing). 

00:17:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Working well. 

00:17:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, and so that I would do that sort of thing or, or we would create a store. We, we went to the store so you knew the store. 

00:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Come back home and create a general store. Only would have my name on it. This is Jean's store. 

00:17:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And make money out of paper and put the denominations of the money on it. Cut them out and with little blot scissors. 

00:17:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And have money and, and make change and just recreate life on a smaller scale. 

00:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, if, if I was taken to a movie, I would make up a play which, of course, look suspiciously similar to the one that I (Laughing) just seen. 

00:18:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:18:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS But nobody, ah, ah, ever, uhm, accused me of plagiarism but I just do those kinds of things that was not just common to me but it was common to other children but I seemed to have had the market on it on my street. 

00:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:18:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Because I was the one people would turn to if they wanted something made up. I'd be the one. 

00:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's almost like you're in a program created. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, it do-, it, it does feel that way. And, and, ah, but, the aggression, you know, the aggression was if, if I wasn't paid attention to or if, uhm, if, if, uhm, my work wasn't honored, I would really just throw a feet. 

00:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  You know, of sometimes. And that, I couldn't understand if somebody didn't. 

00:18:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Pay attention to it. And, uhm, my mother, I was forever sent to, to, to, to go to sleep or, or to sit down in a corner, be spanked. 

00:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, to, to let me know that I'd transgressed. 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah, very at time honored, ah, pol-, politeness rules. An-, (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet I, yet, I don't hear any shame and doubt there. I kinda just felt that you get the feeling- (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You- (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - you may never have much doubt about what you're doing? 

00:19:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You, you, ah, not early on. 

00:19:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Not early on. No. The, it's interesting because it, it was a latent kind of thing that emerged. 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Really later in my life, much later in my life. Uhm, and I think because I've, there was another other periods where I lapsed into a sense of not being co-, in control, I guess, ah, or not even really aware that I wasn't in control. Uhm, and also in competing with other children, other, my, my peers, my contemporaries in high school, in junior high school, kids who had a more middle class families that mine who didn't wear second-hand clothes, who had read, ah, more frequently than I and may have read a little more. I was a terror in that kind of situation, uhm, disruptive. Uhm, but it was a Sunday schoolteacher who read it as shame and doubt. Uhm, mama, Mama Edna read it as shame and doubt. Uhm, Aunt Mary(ph) treated me with love and compassion,- (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - uhm, and there were two Mama Ednas, the tiny one and the Sunday schoolteacher, Mama Edna. 

00:21:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Who, ah, took me under her wing and just kind of gently cared for me, ah, without ever sort of almost unnoticeably affirming me all of the time and saying, "You don't have to behave that way. Uhm, "you don't have to be, uhm, uncomfortable about not knowing something." 

00:21:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And she tried to help me with that. Uhm, I think as an adult, she recognized that I came from a difficult family situation because that family situation was riffed with, ah, all kinds of dynamics that were harsh dynamics. And so I've created in the eye of that storm my own space. 

00:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And when I was out and in that space, I seemed to I was the one that was in charge. I was doing the house, my make-believe things were, what, help me to feel in control. But in real life, where I had to come, uhm, and have to cooperate with other children, or ha-, I have to take my turn in line, I think I felt as, though, I was going to be overlooked because maybe, I really didn't have it whatever it was. So there were two things where- (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So that's the ambivalence you're talking earlier. (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That's the ambivalence. That's the ambivalence because in my family you are also teased unmercifully. 

00:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So whatever your flaws were, were amplified, let me tell you, Jurassic Park hasn't got a dinosaur as big as some of the doubts that could be put in your mind about being teased, about being too light skinned. 

00:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS To be in, in that particular family or to have feet that are too big or hands that are too big or whatever it was, ah, to have that teasing done and it was done unrelentingly because the siblings that I told you about, one of them was, ah, a boy. In fact, two were boys and two were girls: my older sister, Gladys, my second sister, uhm, Mary, who played a very low role in that, in that, at that time but my brother, Budd(ph), played a huge role. And he was a, a, a, a culprit when it came to teasing. And that really that was a profound thing. 

00:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS To have happened. So I would go back into the eye of that storm and create these marvelous other things. School, I was the schoolteacher. I was the storekeeper. I was the house maker and the doll maker. I was all of those things in the world that I created. And in that world, I was on good footing. But step out of that world and I was the kid that had a, a big head and, and big feet and big hands and, and that sort of thing. They all work well for me now but at that time,- 

00:24:05
Challenges continue through life 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY But one of the things- (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you know. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - you're really saying here you know, is how, you know, the development of the autonomy versus shame and doubt. 

00:24:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
ALLEN E. IVEY It isn't just within that one period, it continues on through,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Oh, it does. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - you, you, you build on that at original foundation- (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and you used the, the skills that you develop such along the way. 

00:24:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Well, Erikson says if it is not resolved within this stage, you're going to carry the baggage with you. 

00:24:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  And the good baggage? 

00:24:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And the good baggage is well but you're gonna carry both kinds of baggage with you. And I, uhm, ah, it, it always really bursts from me at adolescence. 

00:24:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uhm, that, uhm, it's sort of all turmoil. (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ) 

00:24:47
Industry vs. Inferiority 

00:24:47
ALLEN E. IVEY So you agreed on our last talk to look at initiative versus guilt, ah, and that's what should little child at age five or seven, and perhaps lied also into late childhood ages eight to 12 where the topic is industry versus inferiority. Ah, I know, I myself have an interesting thought. Here's autonomy, followed by initiative. 

00:25:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Following, followed by industry is very much a doing orientation. 

00:25:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Or something speaks to the Eurocentricity. 

00:25:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm, Erikson's work is a Eurocentric theory. And, so, we started discussing the good from this framework. This is, this is indeed itself can be some, some difficult as we may be missing other important things so we might keep this on our mind as we go around. As we have initiative, guilt, and we have industry versus inferiority, but - 

00:25:45
Family/economic context of developmental history 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - we also know now or back about 1941, '42. 

00:25:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY On to the period of the, of the, of the Second World War. 

00:25:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And economically, I think, had probably changed. But what was going on with your family background of that particular time in the early '40s? 

00:26:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uhm, well, my sister, Mary, got a job, uhm, on that period working in a place called Bemis, Tennessee where there was a, a plant making ornamentation out of ah, aluminum cans and all that sort of thing. And we have to save those things great recycling- (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - kind of period. And during that time, also, you got the, uhm, the rationing stamps and mom would get those. You didn't see an enormous change in my family as far as, uhm, economics was concerned. My sister, Mary, getting a job was, was very exciting because she didn't have to go to work in anybody's house. And she used to wear a black skirt and a white blouse and black shoes with thick rubber, a soles on them and white socks to this new job that she went to. She had to worked very hard but it was just, I was fascinated with the fact that she didn't have to go to anybody's house and work. I thought, well, we have really got something special going on here. And, uhm, so that was one change that I remember now. 

00:27:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS She was young. She was really quite young, uhm, and I think she lied about her age in order to get the job. But she did go, go to work during that period. Also during that period, the trains would come through with soldiers on them. And we would go out to the train tracks and they would throw money. And we get money from- (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - the soldiers. Uhm, mama seemed to have more work in houses than in the fields during that period. In fact, she had three families that she worked for. And so, she, so the money was happening, I suspect, but I didn't see it. 

00:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You know, I didn't see it. We always ate because in that middle house on 264 Westchester Street in the backyard was a chicken coup where my mother raised chickens. Behind that, ah, when, and next to the chicken coup was the outhouse, smokehouse, where my daddy smoked meat from the one hog he would raise. 

00:28:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Every year, raise it, slaughtered it, put the meat in the smokehouse, and next step was the woodshed. Behind that was a garden. 

00:28:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, in the smokehouse was also ah, canned vegetables that mama had made. So that kind of industry was all the way, always around us. And it kept us, it kept our bodies and souls together in a sense. Uhm, so, but I still was wearing hand me down cloths. Daddy had became quite good at packing shoes with newspaper, taking newspaper, cutting it to size of your shoes putting it between the sole that had the hole in it and the remaining inner sole of the shoe. And then taking bits of, of wire hanger and placing it around the top of that shoes to hold it together. And so, in the worse weather, you could get to school, ah, without having too wetter feet and so on. So we still had that going on, ah, even if that, if that time,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Time. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - uhm, ah, in terms of me, the initiatives that I took, I think, really, were just a natural flow out of what I saw happening around me. 

00:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uhm, there was all, Daddy was fixing shoes or, or finding other things to repair to make them more and I guess I found my own way to do that sort of thing. Being wasteful would produce the greatest amount of guilt or wanting things that you couldn't have. Ah, wanting things that would embarrass your parents because they couldn't get it for you. And, and, and momma was the guilt triple layer. She was good at that, ah, of saying to you, "Be grateful for, for what you have and you are an ingrate if you ask for all these things that you can't have." Uhm, ah, and she was fairly unscrupulous in getting the point across to you, that you are not to be greedy about- (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - wanting so many things. Uhm, ah, so that, that, that, as I, and even at the time, I didn't like that. If I wanted to spend an extra nickel on a cup cake, a hostess chocolate cupcake with white squiggles running through it and a white center. Why did I have to petition God, to get it. I've just wanted it. 

00:30:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I wanted it, and I would want to try and get it but that nickel, so that was a lot of money to commit for one child to have it. So, if you got it, one, you would have to have done a number of things to deserve, even to ask for it and if you got it, you had to share. 

00:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My next ah, strong layer of guilt was in being resistant about sharing. And then I get many stories from my mother about Jesus who shared everything, including his life, to make us all, ah, to, to save us from being sinful, and that, that I was being disappointing when I didn't do that. 

00:31:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS But those were some of the things that it was a part of the economic picture, it's a part of socializing us. It was a part of all of that. 

00:31:50
An inevitable tension in life-span development 

00:31:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  One thing kind of coming out of your saying is initiative versus, ah, the negative part and so forth is that, really, there are kind of, two things we kinda always have to look at these people. (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Absolutely. (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Do you want add something? Ah, you want something as an issue but that also inevitably can leave some maybe just, you did the right thing- (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - to have and am I an inferior person because I, I don't feel like of this. 

00:32:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:32:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, I think that's the tension we all live with. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, Erikson makes it functionally resolve this crisis,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - but we're kinda struggling the thing- (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS He almost makes it sound rather li-, linear. 

00:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You know? It's either, or. 

00:32:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:32:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS No it's all of it. It, it, it's both end, you know? 

00:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY You see a lot of good words. But then- (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:32:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  and the other thing that kinda stands up, too, is, you know, the sharing value. 

00:32:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, where those kind of ah, ah, inquisitive orientation,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, individualistic orientation to the, to the thing and,- (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - that you desired to be an individual that you're gonna get this cupcake, expected to share. 

00:33:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That's right, that to share because at, by that time I had a little sister and, ah, she was two years, two days younger than I and I was the oldest. It was expected that I would take care of her and see after her and so,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - I certainly wouldn't get a cupcake, something as lavish as that and have it all to myself, who did I think I was. 

00:33:20
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, it's a kind of wind up this section as and what about school for you at that particular time? You didn't mention the gist. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It was, it was a school was a haven. 

00:33:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS At school, I owe all these ideas that I had. I could play with those ideas and I could compete with people with those ideas and I could, uhm, outdo them with my ideas, you know? And so, school was a haven for me. Uhm, it was a social place. It was a place of learning. It was a place where other adults thought a lot of my mind. At, at that time, I just simply said they thought a lot of me and, uhm, and I was an acting out child all the time so my teachers were really very creative in the way they dealt with that because they saw me as a smart child. And Ms. Martin, I will never forget, and Ms. Aberly(ph) Robinson, I will never forget. Ms. Fanny(ph) ah, Ms. Fanny(ph) May Johnson, all these carry, all these teachers, ah, Ms. Robinson in particularly. She, uhm, I, I was then sixth, seventh, and eight grade, I was a terror. And so, uhm, because I was always attention getting and, and Ms. Robinson was the daughter of the, of the, the uhm, physician who had birthed me into the world, who had brought me into the world so she knew something of me and my family, and she was an only child of the physician,- (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and to have her as a teacher was a marvel because she was so smart and so ingenious at producing things. She was artistic as well as cavalry and everybody wanted to be in our class. Well, before I even got in her class, she'd sort of kept her eye on me and I would be kept out of school from, for any number of infections. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Ah, talking with someone else, was talking particularly in adult, ah, not paying attention and study halt to my lessons and so forth. She would keep me after school and my punishment would be to do something like draw the houses of parliament and, and then do a research on the main, give a background on the houses of parliament,- (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - know what the, the name of the river that was running by and all of those things. And then, she and ah, and not only what I draw it, but I had to color it. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So, I had, had a picture, of, of course, of it and I would do that. And she would post it- (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and so it would be on display. 

00:36:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm, your punishment becomes your reward. 

00:36:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It became my reward. And, uhm, and different things like that. Uhm, ah, we were studying ah, whatever we were studying, whether some kind of fish or whether, she would put to work and she'd used every creative possibility to do that. 

00:36:25
ALLEN E. IVEY More creative again. 

00:36:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. She were. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing I hear and I only to bring this section to a close is, ah, throughout, you've been mentioning models, your, your sister,- (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:36:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Gladys was your sister? (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. My sister Gladys early on, my sister Mary who went to work, momma, yeah, Momma Edna, both Edna's. 

00:36:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Your teacher. 

00:36:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  And really, and one thing, I think, missing from here is that there are really is importance of models- (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Yeah. 

00:36:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - 'coz these people seemed to be standout as I listen to you. 

00:36:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, no, that you don't, in Erickson's work, the implication is the child draws from the mother. You don't even get much of the father in it,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - implication as he draws from the mother but, no, there was, ah, and that the extended community and family. 

00:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So the child grows in family and everything(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:37:15
Identity vs. Role Confusion Is the linear sequence appropriate for all? 

00:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Okay, Jean, we're going to shift into, ah, probably the next stage was this puberty and adolescence and the issue of identity versus role confusion. And I do wanna say is that ah, our(ph) goal is gonna pointed out that maybe the issue of young adulthood, intimacy versus isolation, are for women often that really work through before the issue of personal identity, ah, or at least concurrently. And so, while in general plan is, ah, ah, identity versus role confusion, and intimacy versus isolation, uhm, see what happens but you did to say you want to just say something about this whole important move in your family, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Hmm. 

00:38:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - in which that was part of this issue of family background,- (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - you moved from puberty. 

00:38:15
Identity also comes from social context. 

00:38:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Well, when you ah, talk about identity and role confusion, you know, looking at the economic picture, ah, I guess I must have been, oh, gosh, 10 years old when we moved from 264 Westchester St. to Mary Lane Court. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And, as I think about it, that was ah, the, the clearest indication that something good was happening economically. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You didn't see it in the cloths you wear and even in, in how much a food chain each down a table but we moved- (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:38:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - from 264 Westchester St. to Mary Lane Court. Mary Lane Court was government housing but that wasn't emphasized just as the asthma wasn't emphasized- (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and my father's being a janitor wasn't emphasized. But we were moving because it was better. It was for, to live in a better place. And I got to, to 435 South Liberty. I think it's even wonderful that the street that we lived on was liberty- (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - because it meant, it meant freedom. Uhm, we got there. It was just amazing to me to look around Mary Lane Court. Rows and rows of brick housing, laid out in such a way that it was laid out in a rectangular pattern that probably covered the, the space of a football field. 

00:39:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And in the center, what would have been the playing field was our playground. 

00:39:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And the playground had, uhm, swings and, and seesaws,- (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:40:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and all kinds of, of things to climb on. And out in front of the building that set on a bit of a hill, just a little slope. Outside of that building were flower gardens and the whole playground was filled with grass. 

00:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And in front of the building, which was known as the office building, the Mary Lane Court office building, was a slab of concrete and two mountains of concrete- (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - with uhm, which in the afternoon was turned on, ah, the pipes let to it. I mean, it was turned on and it became like a fountain and so this great spray of water would come out and you could put on your shorts or whatever if you have a swimming suit and you could go and run in the heat of the day, in that afternoon under the spray, and you had to get a special privilege to go from your parents. So, I looked around at all of these marvelous place, grass growing everywhere. It was cut often. It was watered regularly. There were flowerbeds everywhere some tended by the ah, planted and tended by the families who lived in the houses, some just by the, the office itself had people hired just to go around and do, momma raised her own flowers. So, outside of our house was her flowerbed and it was, and was quite remarkable with gladiolas and, and petunias and, and geraniums and anything she wanted to plant. She could make it grow Irises, she could make it grow. (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So, I sat there in our first ah, we moved in the late spring so summer you could be outside and look around. I walked around, I looked around and I sat and I made a comparison to four, of 435 South Liberty to, to 264 Westchester. Well, and first of all when you go in house, you, you didn't have wooden floors that creaked. 

00:42:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  You had concrete floors- (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and you look upstairs instead of out the back door because 264 Westchester St. was a tenement house, double tenement and adjacent. People, families would live adjacent and in our case, it was always a family member. And when you walk out the back door straight through the house at the back door, there was that chicken coup and the outhouse and the smokehouse and, and the, ah, ah, woodshed. And ground was just ground. It was just dirt, black dirt which we swept to keep clean. And a hydrant that came up out of the ground with ashes around it to keep mud from building up and a black pot from momma washed, well at two's, it's 435 South Liberty Street, you washed inside. And momma even had a washing machine there and there was a bathroom inside with a bathtub. You didn't have to put a tin tub next to a hot stove and be afraid of burning yourself. Well, there were two bedrooms in that house and momma even had a bedroom of her own because she put her bed in the living room. We didn't know how to read that at the time but later on, I learned how to read that. Her bed was in the living room and daddy's bed was upstairs. But we had all these beds and all of these rooms, in all of the space. The kitchen had two sinks, a deep sink and a, and a shallow sink. So, you could wash your clothes in one side and rinse them in the other or wash dishes. And it was just fantastic. And there was a stove. All you had to do is put a match to it and came on. Well, I sat down and I put it altogether. Don't have to go outside, go to the store and buy groceries the way other people did. First in creak, no newspaper and the cracks of the wood on the wall. I just put it altogether and I figured it out. 

00:44:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:44:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And I rose up and ran through the house, momma, momma, momma, momma, momma, momma, momma. Mom was sitting outside with cousin Eloise(ph) and they were talking grown-up talking. You weren't allowed to be present to grown-up talks so I was really warning them, as well as taking momma my good news 'coz I knew she had mentioned what I was about to say and I, and I knew she'd be interested in knowing. Momma, momma, momma. She looked up she said, "What is wrong with you?" I said, Momma, we're rich, ain't we?" 

00:44:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:44:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My mother's mouth fell open. She looked out from under her glasses at me, not the expression I had hoped for, and she had been shelling peas. 

00:45:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS She pulled her apron up around the peas so as not to loose anyone she stood,- (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - she stood erect- (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
ALLEN E. IVEY - and she wasn't but 5'2" but whenever momma did that I always said she was like the Lord's train. She filled up the space she was in and she was filling it up pretty good. It wasn't the, the reaction I had wanted. And so, she said to me, "Young lady," and nodded her head for me to go back into the kitchen. When I walked into the kitchen and I thought this is not what I wanted, I want momma to be enthusiastic about this. She came in and took her apron off, put it on the table and said, "There is no such word as ain't." I was like momma is correcting my English while what I'm telling her this marvelous news. 

00:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY She said, "Well." And I knew what she meant. So I said, "Momma, we are rich aren't we?" And my mother said, "No, we are not." And she went on to talk about, to ask me to tell her what did "rich" mean and I told her about all these things. She said, "That's only one definition of rich. No, we don't have money. We are not rich that way. We are rich in blessings and we are rich in God's love and we are rich," and she named all the reasons why we were rich and then proceeded to tell me how I could become richer. And so, I now tell that as a story. And it's called, "Momma, we're rich, ain't we?" 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uhm, so that was the first indication of economic change. The other indication came later. And I then was, and this moves as a little bit. I was then about 16 years old and, ah, momma gave me and my sister a charge account at Fanny's Dress Shop. Fanny's Dress Shop was an exclusive dress, dress shop and we could go there after working and saving our money and put fine dresses on lay away and work and get them out. Now, that was really an indication. I just felt momma didn't understand that we were rich. That, that was an indication because we were now buying new clothes and not just getting hand me down clothes. 

00:47:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. The identity gets tied up in that pretty well, you know, how you look. Ah, through that you're able to say, "I gotta dress at Fanny's Dress Shop," you know, and even if you hadn't dubbed(ph) and even if it was a lay away, you acted as though you had it and people would say, "No, you didn't bring. You go and get it. When we're gonna see it?" I'm only gonna wear it to special places. I won't be wearing it to school. 

00:48:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You know, and you'd work hard to make that money happen because that was the only way you are going to, to get that dress. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. That's a wonderful story. Ah, the, I was wondering you are getting now into puberty, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - discovering sexuality, perhaps discovering boys, high school. Ah, how was that for you? 

00:48:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I think I had discovered boys early on and what I'm about to say now is something I've never talked about. I discovered boys early on when I didn't know that I didn't really love myself. 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And just as girls seek love in all the wrong places,- (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - petting, and kissing, and sexuality, all of that came into play much too soon in my life, most, much more soon that I had come into full recognition of myself. And this was all done at the end of basketball games, ah, if you could get a chance to go the, the kind of sneaking to, to get the boy that you loved or had a crush on, to pay attention to you, ah, and, and giving him liberties- (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - that really were seeking approval kind of liberties, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Wanting someone to think of you as pretty- (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and doing favors, letting someone kiss you, letting someone feel you in the wrong places just as the way of having, hopefully having someone say that you're pretty, that, that, that you're special, you see. (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So, that also was part of it. And so often I, and, and I'm saying this to you now because I, I think I have come to a place in my life that is a good place and- (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS -I can say this now without, ah, without any shame but with a more deeper understanding of who I am now and who I was then. 

00:50:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:50:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You see. But I didn't understand then because the, these things weren't talked about. The extrinsic defined you- (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY  Hmm. 

00:50:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and the older I got, the more of the extrinsic defined me. 

00:50:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS The approval that I wasn't getting in my family for being pretty,- (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - I was looking for it somewhere else. And of course the disappointments were great and sad. You see. 

00:51:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, that was ah, high school as a hard period for you then? (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It was difficult, it was difficult on those, on the sort of personal social level- (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and it was, uhm, ah, a triumph a, a, a, after a fashion on the scholastic intellectual level. I had threw myself into my books. That was the one place that I could be thought I was beautiful in getting my lessons and making good grades. And there was no, not much rivalry in, within the family, of, of, for me on that as sort of rule that area. Uhm, and, uhm, so, so I'm two different levels, two different things were happening. I was great in my books or at least a, yeah, I was, I think it was a safe grade. I finished 6th in my high school class and cried because I didn't finish one,- (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (laughing) 

00:51:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - but I didn't bite anybody on the ear. 

00:51:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You didn't bite anybody on the ear. 

00:51:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS The way Mike Tyson just did in his fight (laughing). 

00:52:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You did it on your own without knocking somebody else down. 

00:52:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY The, ah, strength, ah, that I hear that I like as it, it's really, a word "beauty" versus something that boys wouldn't have talked about,- (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh-uhm. 

00:52:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - the need of being beautiful. So the issue that really is a very gender specific thing. 

00:52:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:52:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Boys recognized often what they've done. (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:52:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Women, ah, for parents and looks. 

00:52:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That's right. So even though, I was absolutely prolific in my school work that beauty piece was a big piece and it wasn't, it wasn't, ah, it wasn't something that, uhm, that I certainly was, I'd ever been made to feel beautiful except by his family and my sister, Gladys, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
Intimacy vs. Isolation 

00:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  And, as we get that transition to ah, we got have what achieve that ah, star in schools, 6th in your high school class, then you moved to that sort of ah, late adolescents or early adulthood period, ah, and intimacy versus isolation. 

00:53:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:53:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And, ah, I suspect some of these things are playing themselves in ah, of the past. They're still there. How was that going? 

00:53:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  My life story and I'm writing it now and my memoirs, uhm, become really, really pretty. Ah, I don't want to, it's intense, it's desperate- (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:53:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - in some sense. I married at 19 and a half years old. (crosstalk) 

00:53:50
ALLEN E. IVEY All right, nineteen and a half. 

00:53:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And I wasn't pregnant. But I married because he was the only man who would ever treated me as though I was someone who is marriageable. 

00:54:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Then, he was six and a half years older and he was a noncommissioned officer and my criteria was that whoever it was I would marry would have to have a good job and he'd have to look very nice when he went to work. 

00:54:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And my husband certainly, ah, the young man that I married, ah, certainly did do that. He was a noncommissioned officer in the Air Force. And in four months, I was pregnant and our first child was born in July of '57. We married in '56 and our first child was born in July of '57. And 17 and a half months later, our second child was born. 

00:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh, uh-huh. I understand that we're desperate. (Laughs) 

00:54:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes and, and, uhm, and when our child was 22 months old, the 3rd child was born. And so, there I am, the Suez Canal Crisis came up in that period when I was still pregnant- (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:55:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and we will fear for that we will be invaded. And there, I was sitting, trying to figure what I would do with two small children and pregnant and husband off on secret missions and so forth. It was a desperate time. I moved away from my family and all of the, all of the unresolved- (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - became imminent in my life. And it was a very desperate end, and, in some ways, sad time. 

00:55:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Yeah. 

00:55:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, the joy of the children expect that it was, it was really being alone. 

00:55:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, two, it was, one is that there was not joy- (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:55:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - because there were secret missions that had to be flown and two young people who had married short time after meeting each other who didn't really know each other and a husband who was the oldest of 10 children of a Sheikh Rafah. 

00:56:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS We'd never talked about not having children. I just thought that's what we should, we would do. 

00:56:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Also I didn't know how not to have children, I was a Baptist child and I wasn't sexually active so I didn't know how not to have children. Ah, so, the children just came. And that when the third one came after the first one came, I used birth, birth control and then the second one came, and the third one and he used birth control. He had a vasectomy- (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:56:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and so that's why I never had other children. But, uhm, that is where all of those issues of, of attentions- (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - mounting and colliding and colluding. 

00:57:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  It's kinda like all of the life crisis arrived at once. (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS They all arrived. And when I needed really to been there for my children. And so, I was just trying to be there for them but then I left myself alone,- (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you see, in order to focus I'm being a mother. So, I was other during that period of about for I'd say a period of a good 15 years, I was other. 

00:57:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. And so there has been no identity and there's no intimacy. (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS No, no. Identity came as a result of what in a practical sense had to be done, of what in the crisis had to be done. I, I merged to giving people the perceptions of being a very strong woman when I was actually one of the most vulnerable women ever, you know? 

00:57:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS But I did what I had to be done as my mother had done, you know? 

00:57:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And as my father and my sister had done. I did what had to be done. That, that gives you a kind of veneer- (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:58:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - or as far as identity is concerned. 

00:58:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You have that. But to say that it is the deepest part of who you are. And it's the most conscious part of who you are. The most intentional part of who you are. (crosstalk) 

00:58:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It's not necessarily the case I found. 

00:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY So, there's really the long period there and you're used focusing on others- (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - rather than yourself.- (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

00:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Not that, well, you're focusing on others, but you need a balance - 

00:58:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

00:58:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - in relationship to yourself. I mean, you're living, ah, an army-based (inaudible ) from everybody else,- (crosstalk) 

00:58:42
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:58:42
ALLEN E. IVEY - making on your own. (crosstalk) 

00:58:42
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

00:58:42
ALLEN E. IVEY (inaudible ) no extended family at that point. And you're just there as a. 

00:58:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And not really, not really a nurturing relationship. 

00:58:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And your relationship with the husband (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:58:57
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It's interesting, because the nurturers that I mentioned earlier on mostly came from outside of my family. I married my family. 

00:59:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. You married your family. 

00:59:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS The expectation that I would be able to handle and do whatever needed to, to be done was there. But absent the opportunity to be deeply created,- (crosstalk) 

00:59:15
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:59:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - absent the opportunity to move in to the eye of the storm. I now was part of the storm. 

00:59:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And how long did that continue? (crosstalk) 

00:59:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  That went on my marriage lasted for nine years- (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and all three of the children were born, ah, during that period. And, uhm, the marriage discontinued. It was, that was a divorce and I've never said that because I held on in being other. I held on to the image of being a widow. My husband died of leukemia because somewhere in the course of flying those secret missions, it is thought he may have come in touch with some nuclear materials. 

01:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS But in his becoming ill, uhm, whatever his, I don't know what he was imagining at the time but whatever his imagination was causing him to think of leaving a young wife and children behind, it became dangerous in our household. 

01:00:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, uhm, there was divorce, and, and all of that, you know? You just, you just keep your balance as best you can because it's one way for things after the other. 

01:00:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  His one way of things after the other and, uhm, enough and, and, and to say I kept my balance throughout it all would be a great exaggeration,- (crosstalk) 

01:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you know. I did- (crosstalk) 

01:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Why is it? 

01:00:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS When you talk about ins, intimacy versus isolation, I was isolated. (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS No question about it, you know? 

01:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it kind of- (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And I would just say though that intimacy see, see to me, Erikson, Erikson errs in terms of being white and male. And again, thinking in a very linear way I'm thinking because it's either or for him all the way through. You're either intimate or you're isolated and I had some glimpses of intimacy, obviously, I did, and I don't mean just sexual. I thought I was in love,- (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:01:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you see. But that rela, that very relationship arose out of the fact that whereas I had been successful in Tennessee in my education. I've gotten to Illinois, to the University of Illinois from little-old Jackson, Tennessee, to a campus that was as big as my town- (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and was marginal, and just as it is- (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You went to college where? 

01:01:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - at the University of Illinois. 

01:01:50
ALLEN E. IVEY At the, at University of Illinois, and what years was it? 

01:01:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS '55. 

01:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY '55, so- (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS '55, '56, and I met my husband. (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Why, why you at your old? 

01:02:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I met my husband in '56- (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. 

01:02:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - married him in '56. 

01:02:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Did you stay at the U, UI or? (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS No. I didn't stay. You know, I've got through my freshman year,- (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
ALLEN E. IVEY That's it. Okay, okay. 

01:02:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - but I was fearful that if I went back, I wouldn't be successful at all,- (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:02:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - because I had been marginal, I made Cs, I never made Cs. Now, I know that I was doing well coming from the school that had secondhand books, coming from a school that had, ah, equipment that was left over mater, just it was handed, handed down close, it was handed down chemistry material, biology material, books, 20, sometimes 30 years old but we didn't know that. It wasn't emphasized, what was emphasized was to achieve. 

01:02:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS So, when I got to the University of Illinois, I thought that I had come from an even playing field. And when I was marginal, I was the absolute failure. 

01:02:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Absolute failure without question. And that sense of failure heightened other incompletes in my life. 

01:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:03:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It just, it's, everything just became larger than life and it was mostly not, not very much a complement. 

01:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-hmm. Okay. When did you head back to school? 

01:03:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I, I was married in, in '56 in June of '56. In fact, I was married on June 20th of 1956 and the marriage ended nine years later and three or four years later, perhaps four or five years later, I came back. So, I was 14 years out of, out of school. 

01:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-hmm. 

01:03:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And I came back to school right here at the School of Education. 

01:03:40
ALLEN E. IVEY  Nice. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. With all of the unresolved- (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY That's, that's 68 with all of the stuff on (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. 

01:03:50
Generativity vs. Stagnation Note how unresolved issues from the past appear later in life. Onawumi describes her life as a mosaic rather than as linear 

01:03:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Well, Jean, you've made it Onawumi(ph), excuse me I've known you as Jean in the past. (crosstalk) 

01:04:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I know. 

01:04:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm sorry. Ah, so-called next stage Erikson's theory is Generativity versus Stagnation. Adulthood 30 to 65, (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:04:15
ALLEN E. IVEY - and ah, it kinda left you with a, ah, in a state of crisis and, ah, I think he used the word "desperation", (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:04:20
ALLEN E. IVEY - and it was clear that very few of any of the Erikson issues were resolve. (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
ALLEN E. IVEY - I see you in here today, so. (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - ah, let's move to adulthood and ah, see what happened. 

01:04:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I, I love that, let's move to adult, adulthood. I think I just- (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm not looking forward for, to myself, I'm not at it yet. (crosstalk) 

01:04:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - ah, I, I think, I think, uhm, I think I've just maybe arrived at the doorstep of adulthood. Uhm, ah, ah, I worked in the War On Poverty Program I mentioned to you and when we're off-camera and, uhm, and in that period, that was when I started coming into my own again now I was there in Denver, working at the Eastside, ah, community center. That after having worked in a record shop, making a nickel commission on every 45 sold and a dime on every LP sold. Ah, they're at the Salmon(ph) a record shop and was discovered really at the Salmon(ph) Record Shop by the community workers that came in at War on Poverty program. The outside workers that came through and surveyed the community to look for people that they thought could relate to the community. 

01:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Now I'm gonna interrupt right here right now. I think one thing is really important for people to hear, we make jokes, we put down the war on poverty- (crosstalk) 

01:05:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:05:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - but known any number of people whose lives have been remarkably changed- (crosstalk) 

01:05:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Absolutely. 

01:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - by the Johnson years. 

01:05:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Absolutely. 

01:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  That is what the people off-camera watching- (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Oh yes. 

01:05:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - this to be aware of this, that this was external factors in each community,- (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:06:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - and they're government make a difference in the lives of people,- (crosstalk) 

01:06:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS They do. The War on pro, poverty Poverty program really set me in a, a fantastic direction, one that changed my life and for the better all around. So I was discovered standing at the record counter, this ah, blonde, blue-eyed young man, Roger, came in. I still remember his name. Roger came in and said, "We've heard about you and I wanted to talk to you." and I almost fainted standing there at the record shop. There were no customers at that time and he said, "I'm at the Eastside action center just up the street and we're looking for people who are resourceful people in the community and everyone, when we say we're looking for talent to run that center by, that center to be run by a community people you're name has come up a number of times." And so standing at that record shop in a short period of time, I had solved all kinds of problems standing there with the people. I never traveled very much before then and never been very far from the Baptist Church,- (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:07:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - from the choir stand, from the Sunday school, ah, lessons still I went to this record shop which I was sure that cast me at the Babylon. (crosstalk) 

01:07:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:07:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - And that I would be learning in hell sometime soon. But I did stand there and met, met a lot of people and helped a lot of people just by talking to them. So, Roger said, "We, we think that you will be a great candidate to apply for one of the community workers." I applied and I got the job. Now, I worked at the Community Action Center for, for about three years. Advocating for people on assistance, ah, advocating for the old, advocating for the young, ah, sometimes talking to the older man in the area, sometimes sending messages to the mayor and so on. The next person to come through, and no, not the next person but over the year, those three years, my life, my economic picture changed for the better, my self-esteem changed for the better. Ah, I'm still I was, other cause I'm advocating now- (crosstalk) 

01:08:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - for, really for other people but it changed for the better. My children, ah, weren't now children of, of, of, of, of with just ah, me, I was a single mom by this time and ah, and their father had died of leukemia. So now, I'm their sole support and they were flourishing in school. Uhm, so, in 1970, I started working for the Vote Technical Consulting Company, and I was a power professional consultant for them. (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And in that role I advised people who were in much higher positions- (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - on how to help communities to thrive, poor communities and poor people in community because we were the frontline work, workers. My work in that setting caught the attention of a young man whose name is John Warfield, and he's still alive, who have been asked to direct the first, uhm, Equal Educational Opportunity Program at Macalester College.(crosstalk) 

01:09:10
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:09:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And his brother saw me at work and told John he should hire me. And that was my first step into higher education. I felt a lot better about myself. I was taking care of myself and my family with great pride. Uhm, while at Macalester College, I did a fairly good job coming from really the stance of a novice. Remember I hadn't finished the University of Illinois. I'd gone to the Denver extension, Colorado, University of Colorado Denver Extension and made A's- (crosstalk) 

01:09:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:09:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - in my classes there while working at the War on Poverty Program. So that was reassuring for me to make- (crosstalk) 

01:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:10:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - A's at, at the college level was very reassuring but I was unrelenting when I got in my books. I really was back to the old way- (crosstalk) 

01:10:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and I studied very hard. So I had that to my credit. And, uhm, those, all of those things sort of built to give me the kind of profile that they were looking for. I'm, I was not, ah, had not completed college, they thought that with these young people coming to the Macalester, their families hadn't completed college first generation, ah, college students all around and that a pair of professional counselor would be the kind that could help them, someone who had worked with all kinds of populations- (crosstalk) 

01:10:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and I went and I, I was, fairly, fairly successful but I have become very militant by that time. (crosstalk) 

01:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Very, very, very militant. 

01:10:55
Cultural identity is an important part 

01:10:55
Of personal identity. 

01:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY  We're- (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Ah. 

01:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - also bringing in Bill Cross' cultural identity theory- (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Absolutely. 

01:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - under the issue of being an African-American- (crosstalk) 

01:11:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Absolutely. 

01:11:10
ALLEN E. IVEY became very central. 

01:11:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It became very central and, uhm, and so that came to play politically on the work that I did. They are, and I too, I became a kind of counselor cum, ah, community worker in, in that setting. Hubert Humphrey was at the, uhm, at Macalester at the time. And so was uhm, a, a gentleman who still now a great voice on servicing the aging, Arthur, uhm, I cannot think of his last name, but he's still alive and still doing marvelous work and I'll think of it before I'm finished I hope, but Art, Art was there. I never took advantage of getting to know Mr. Humphrey, though he was always a very pleasant person but I didn't want to be perceived as a "knuckle-tongue." So, I didn't take advantage of the opportunity to sit. Here was an advocate, I could have sat and talked with someone who had influence at the very top of the country but I didn't do it because of, of, of still so much turmoil but I stayed at Macalester for two years. And while there, I met Norma Jean Anderson and it became clear to me about the way I was being treated that I couldn't proceed without a degree. And she was just coming here, I believe, to the University and I followed that, and followed through and- (crosstalk) 

01:12:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And here at the University of Massachusetts. 

01:12:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - U, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and, ah, I followed through and came on here. Still with my personal issues, very much unresolved, very tumultuous. Still, I think that were tangent- (crosstalk) 

01:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY That we're around the time with the, the, the late '60s- (crosstalk) 

01:13:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - late '60s. 

01:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY - tumultuous as well. 

01:13:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes, yes. And, ah, but I was good with my students and some of them are still in touch with me. (crosstalk) 

01:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - Some of them have died and I was very sad, but many of them are very, very successful and some of those are in touch. Realizing that I didn't have a degree and still being more inclined to be achievement-oriented. (crosstalk) 

01:13:25
ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:13:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - To put achievement over resolution of personal issues. (crosstalk) 

01:13:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS To put achievement over even trying to figure out what those personal issues were. (crosstalk) 

01:13:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:13:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Uhm, that's where I was good and that's where, that's where I went, I went in that particular channel of things. 

01:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, in one sense you have carried through the childhood organization- (crosstalk) 

01:13:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah. 

01:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY - and so forth and regenerating new things. 

01:13:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That's right. 

01:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY But in an academic setting and tying it to work- (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS That's right. 

01:13:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - and in school. (crosstalk) 

01:13:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - trying it to work and school 'coz that's where, just as if it had been. (crosstalk) 

01:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Finding a place where you can use that thing. 

01:14:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Just the same way it had been in school in my early years. To excel in school was something that I could do. Personally, it had always been choppy waters. (crosstalk) 

01:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:14:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  It had always been difficult to navigate those waters, so, let me concentrate on that which I can do, and I did. My children were doing increasingly well because our economic situation was very dissent and, uhm, we owned our own home in Denver, I left at home and left it, ah, a rental and I went to live in college housing so that was the first college campus I'd lived on was at Macalester and it's a charming campus to live on. My children had access to Olympic, uhm, swimming coaches and all sorts of top-rate people. And so they were, they were doing much better but we ran into, ah, issues there, issues of race and culture clashing in that setting and I was too, I was like a bear, you know, taking care of her cubs in that setting so that aggressiveness that I have spoke off earlier was really at its height in that situation. Uhm, by the time I did get accepted here at the University of Massachusetts in fall of 1971, I think I was 33 or four years old and suddenly I was in adulthood but I, I say to you now and I know it to be the case that it was truly a traumatized adulthood and in some ways it was a very sort of, uhm, it was a very sort of flawed adulthood, really foremost stuck in adolescence. 

01:15:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:15:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  You see, much more stuck there, and, uhm, and so I flailed a lot, you know, I was telling to them not to do my work but I wasn't really focused because I was now a student and still focused on getting others to approve of me and then when they did, I didn't believe them. 

01:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Many people, ah, gave me high accolades but because I did not yet have my own resolution, I, I thought they are being fooled on somehow, ah, now, a, a kind of, of, of, of joke,- (crosstalk) 

01:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you know, because they didn't know, that I'd really didn't have it. This was my own- (crosstalk) 

01:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - as Erikson says, there are two voices talking,- (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:16:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - you know? And in, in that inner script, there were a lot of negative things that I was saying to myself. So, it was, uhm, it was a particularly debit. I remember calling my mother during that period and I said momma, I've come here to the University of Massachusetts. She said, "I know you have." (crosstalk) 

01:17:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Ahh. 

01:17:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And, ah, ahh, and I had shared it- (crosstalk) 

01:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - ah, just as I shared my cupcake I got my sister, my youngest sister, in here too. So, uhm, I said enough I'm here with people who know a lot more than I know, they've had better educations than I've had and, ah, I'm over my head and my mother's response was characteristically mama, mama's, mama's gotten through life, a hard life by putting her chin up, her shoulders back, setting her face and doing work she had to do and her response to me was along those lines and it was devastating because what I needed her to do was something she had never really done and that was to hug me and says it's gonna be alright. That's really what I needed. (crosstalk) 

01:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:17:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You see. And instead, she, she gave me what she knew to give me. 

01:18:00
ALLEN E. IVEY What's the same due(ph) that difficult time? 

01:18:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I don't know, I think just I've, I was in one of our, our group sessions when we used to do the T-group intensives- (crosstalk) 

01:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and in one of the exercises was to become an animal and I became a turtle. 

01:18:25
ALLEN E. IVEY A turtle? 

01:18:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - with a hard shell and then tender inside,- (crosstalk) 

01:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:18:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and I drew into my shell. And when it came time to come out, I came out very tentatively. (crosstalk) 

01:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And it's hard to come for you? 

01:18:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I came out very tentatively. I- (crosstalk) 

01:18:40
ALLEN E. IVEY You came out of the shell very tentatively? 

01:18:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - very, very tentatively and everybody was surprised that of all the animals I would become, would be that of a turtle. But in some ways, it was the absolute right metaphor for a tortoise has been here forever, and it's not very pretty to some as long as he's on land but you put it in his element- (crosstalk) 

01:19:05
ALLEN E. IVEY  Ahh. 

01:19:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and none is more graceful,- (crosstalk) 

01:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:19:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and it has endurance and persistence. (crosstalk) 

01:19:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:19:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, in some ways, I think I had that somewhere. I don't know where precisely it came from. I think it came partly from mama, partly from all of those role models that everybody gave me a piece of something that I, though I had not put it together in a tapestry that was easily recognizable I had all the parts that I needed somehow to inch my way, to sort of turtle my way on land in an awkward kind of way into certain kinds of successes, small successes, and I was in any success seem to have been enough for me. 

01:19:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Any success was enough. 

01:19:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, yeah. So I would just seem to go from one small success to another. 

01:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY  What part about the transition for you? (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:20:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You seem to be soaring now. 

01:20:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Well I think the experience at the school of education which was absolutely painful in a lot of ways but so enlightening trying so hard to, to become a doctoral, a really legitimate doctoral candidate, not knowing what it was and to embarrass, to really ask deeply into it, you see, but I stayed with it, and ah, Ron Frederickson, Don Carou(ph), Jack Wideman, you. So many people, ah, Norma, Norma Jean Anderson. Uhm, on and on, I could name the people,- (crosstalk) 

01:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:20:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - uhm, who I got a little something from everybody, no one could really get up on me, not really because I was by that time almost panicked, almost hysterical and my aggression was the thing that people most often experienced. (crosstalk) 

01:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:21:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And so, ah, but there was some comforting that was done. 

01:21:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I've got a challenger, this question a little bit. (crosstalk) 

01:21:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm. 

01:21:20
ALLEN E. IVEY In my experience, ah, with you has always been, first word comes in mind is gentleness. Ah, second one, I guess, is power, ahh, so I'm,- (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I think that you would have to say aloof, uhm- (crosstalk) 

01:21:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - You know I felt- (crosstalk) 

01:21:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - well may be not, may be not- (crosstalk) 

01:21:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - you aren't, coz I'm kind of aloof for distance, it's ok with me. (crosstalk) 

01:21:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, yeah, but, I, I, I know that I was aloof because again, I didn't want people to know that I really didn't have all they thought I had. 

01:21:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  So I've heard you saying that there are number of people that sort of almost surrounded you. (crosstalk) 

01:21:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  Had reached out. 

01:22:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And said you're cool, you're good, you're wonderful. (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, yeah. 

01:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - and then- (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS But I didn't. 

01:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I took at some point. 

01:22:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS I didn't. I, I- (crosstalk) 

01:22:05
ALLEN E. IVEY - when, how did it take? (crosstalk) 

01:22:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - couldn't say that. Well, I think what happened- (crosstalk) 

01:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Or it hasn't taken. 

01:22:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Well it, oh, yes, it has, ah, but I think it was after. 

01:22:15
ALLEN E. IVEY After. 

01:22:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS It was after the school event- (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
ALLEN E. IVEY This kind of- (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - when I was, uhm, when I left there and went to the counseling center then at, at Burkshire(ph) house, it was then known as the counseling center, the counseling inquiry development center- (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and I work there and that staff and that I'm still in touch with, Tets(ph) Logan(ph), whom I love. (crosstalk) 

01:22:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - uhm, uhm, all, all of the people there were very supportive. 

01:22:40
Note how unresolved issue from the past appear later in life. Onawumi describes her life as a mosaic rather than as linear. 

01:22:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - so constantly. (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS My awkwardness- (crosstalk) 

01:22:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - so sort of people plus seeing yourself doing that. 

01:22:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes, and being successful, but I could never be successful enough. It was almost like ah, an addiction, I need it more and more to prove to myself that I had something special. 

01:22:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:22:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  And, uhm, and so, and I, and I couldn't let my work at, be regularly critiqued in my doctoral because I was terrified that that critique met, I didn't have it. So I just was never fully successful, there are, I did a lot of work, I work with Erikson's theory, I worked with Super's theory. Made sense of them and, and found the limitations, did all of that stuff but never did bring it to closure. (crosstalk) 

01:23:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:23:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - I foreclosed on the doctoral dis, ah, ah, experience long before I left it and didn't know I had. 

01:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY It's still never too late. 

01:23:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS You see. Well, it's interesting, I'm not sure now that I even want it or need it. (crosstalk) 

01:23:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

01:23:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - Its ah, its amazing that way but anyway, uhm, so, so I did go through those, there, that was very, very tumultuous but I was, I was I mean, I, I, I was still going and I was still doing things and these things were making sense. Finally, I was actually recruited to the, to Amherst College where I'm now Associate Dean of students. (crosstalk) 

01:24:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:24:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS  That was terrifying, because now, as opposed to being a counselor where, which is what I was at Burkshire(ph) House, ah, if the counseling a career development center private, having these ma, ma, these, these successes with different students and sometimes adults, ah, graduate students as well as undergraduate, ah, now, I was going to be on their front, front lines open for all the world to see and I went to the director of the counseling and career development center and said to her, "Could I just go for a year and then come back if it doesn't work out?" she said, "No, you cannot come back. You have to go, and you have to face this because it's time and you are absolutely ready to do this. Since being at the college, ah, and I went in '85, July of '85 as Assistant Dean, I worked very hard, and what was to have been three years to get 10 turned it to nine months, in nine months I was made Associate Dean. Ah, because I had no administrative background to prove that I can do this, but in nine months, I was made Associate Dean and I have been Dean there for 12 years now. But in the course of this 12 years this one I came into my own. (crosstalk) 

01:25:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:25:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS When all of those pieces of support, when all of those overtures started to, started to come together as a marvelous mosaic, that is me. And, uhm, and I stopped being focused on other after having a heart attack in '87 and I started really being intentionally focused on myself. My children were by that time through college and successful in their various ways- (crosstalk) 

01:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:26:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and I started to focus on me and I found myself to be a woman in great need of focusing care and I started caring for myself and paying attention to myself and my prayer was to be present in my life at the moment, do not be stuck in the past with things that hadn't worked, or in the future with things I dreamed of working but to be in my present. I'd, I, I realized by that time how many times I have been blessed and missed the blessing because I was stuck either in the future in a dream of what could be or in the past in the nightmare of what had been and I just realized how many opportunities I have missed and I prayed to stay in the moment. I'm there, in the moment in my life and all of these journeys that I have taken, all of these paths that I have been on each one left me with part of what is the mosaic now that is me, and now I'm completing the mosaic and I'm completing it consciously, intentionally. The flaws are still there but that needing approval, that is still with me is now focused. I go before audiences, I perform my stories for them and sometimes they are jubilant- (crosstalk) 

01:27:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:27:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and very demonstrative. Sometimes, they're moderately jubilant but it's alright because the first line of approval, from me is always being provided by me. (crosstalk) 

01:27:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:27:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - And that is what I finally came to. It took a long, long journey to get here but I am never more pleased to say that I am well on my way to becoming an adult- (crosstalk) 

01:27:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:27:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - and into finding myself not in a state of despair, (crosstalk) 

01:28:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:28:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - no, but in a state of hopefulness and a state of looking forward and a state of celebration and, and that's where I am now. (crosstalk) 

01:28:10
ALLEN E. IVEY It's a mosaic rather than linear progression. 

01:28:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes, that's for me, that's what it has become. 

01:28:20
ALLEN E. IVEY There's a piece that, ah, you sort of come here to the end and you've said, ah, ahh, you're moving a little ahead of your time. (crosstalk) 

01:28:25
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

01:28:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You're talking about despair because he talks about old age 65 to death- (crosstalk) 

01:28:30
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

01:28:30
ALLEN E. IVEY - I think that's probably over certification to these very different stages. (crosstalk) 

01:28:35
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Sure. 

01:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY - Ah, the joy you're getting, in terms of your national recognition of a storyteller- (crosstalk) 

01:28:40
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

01:28:40
ALLEN E. IVEY - seem to be a very important part of your integration going to the (inaudible [01:28:46.916]) getting telling the story like you've shared with- (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh-huh. 

01:28:45
ALLEN E. IVEY - me with 2,000 or more people. Ah, working at the literally the number one of all arts college in the country,- (crosstalk) 

01:28:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - Amherst College, uhm, all of these must add up to some very, it's pretty hard to draw those change of self definition. 

01:29:05
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's amazing to me. It's still is amazing to me. You know, you know, wonderful not amazing I'm surprised but amazing that this journey has led in this direction to be number one, to- (crosstalk) 

01:29:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh huh. 

01:29:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - being a part of number one kinds of things. To being a part of, of a first level of fine things, fine art, fine education. The things that, ah, that I had aspired to. But I think that's the thing that makes me now awfully good at both these things, is that self-affirmation that I am good. If you took away Amherst College I'd still be good. If you took me off the stage I'd be sad, but I'd still be good. (crosstalk) 

01:30:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh huh. 

01:30:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - Uhm, Ray Charles was the first voice I heard after I said that I was going to become a professional storyteller. And I did say that, and I went to then the President of Amherst College, Peter Pouncey, who had now observed me from a number a years, from eight or nine or ten years,- (crosstalk) 

01:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:30:20
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - in my role as Associate Dean of students. And he had respect for me as he did for all of us in the Dean's office. Now, I went to Peter Pouncey and said I wanted to go into storytelling and asked him if he would fund me, if it was possible that he could fund me, so I could travel and go and see what the master tellers were doing, so I'd know what their conversations were about and I'd know what their presentations were about and I could sit at their feet and be educated by them. And without hesitation, without hesitation, he did that. And believe me, that was extraordinary. I couldn't get that done now, it's a different day. (crosstalk) 

01:31:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:31:00
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - It's a different time. But he did. And, uhm, he said, oh, you'll be famous, as did you know. And that's exactly what I was wanting to be, until I heard Ray Charles. And just a couple of nights before, I've had gone- (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:31:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - in to meet with Peter. And he said, what, what, what, what do you mean? And I said, Ray Charles was being interviewed. And the interviewer said to Ray Charles, "Ah, did you ever think you'd be as famous as you are? Ray Charles and his signature, Ray Charles held way his he, held his head back and behind his dark glasses and his big teeth showing and said, well I dare you. I, I, I thought about, ah, just being good- (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:31:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - at what I do. I, I, I, I know a, a lot of people aha, that are famous but they're not good. But I know a lot of people aha, that are good but they're not famous. I, I, I just wanted to be good and it's been my good fortune to also be famous.- (crosstalk) 

01:32:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:32:15
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS - That's what I told Peter Pouncey, I said I want to be a good storyteller. And if the fame comes, I'll take it, but I really, really want to be good. I set a goal for four years, it was then 1992, and 1995, I got a first, not a first hint because I had been working hard at small audiences, but I had a large audience of 2000, just give a standing ovation, after I told ah, an original story entitled "The Day, Destiny" called a parent-teacher meeting at the A&P grocery store. (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:32:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And that, I said, I wonder what Ray Charles would say. I suspect he said, "Well, ah, young lady, ah, he he, it seemed like to me, you're on your way to be good, but don't get caught up in the flame. (crosstalk) 

01:33:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh. 

01:33:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS And that's really what it's about to be true to the storytelling, to be, to not let wounded anything caused me to manipulate the storytelling, to get the adoration of the audience. But to stay true to it, and if there's any adoration to come, fine, but if it's not, fine if you're true to the crowd. And that's what I'm doing these days. And I think I'm truer to myself. 

01:33:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, this may be one place that Erickson's theory had something to say. It sounds like ego integrity to me. 

01:33:45
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes. Yes- (crosstalk) 

01:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY  And it feels good. 

01:33:50
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Yes, it does real good. 

01:33:50
Reflections on the interview. 

01:33:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Look, I think that wonderful example, ah, ah, ego integrity aren't related that way, you know. I might just ask you, what are your reflections ah, on our conversation? Ah, what stood up for you? Ah- (crosstalk) 

01:34:10
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Hmm, well, you always easy to talk me, that, that's what you do. And it's always easy to do. But I was so pleased to have you asked me to come, an, an honor to have you ask me to come. Because I wanted an opportunity to talk about this. My writing is still ah, something that terrifies me. And I'm writing now my memoirs entitled "No man cannot hinder me". And that title is salute to my mother. It comes from ah, the, the refrain of a gospel/spiritual, and it goes like this, "Ride on King Jesus, no man cannot hinder me, ride on King Jesus. No man cannot hinder me, no man cannot hinder me." And I guess, the reflections, is that simple people gave me a foundation that sought me over, some pretty trouble times, into this marvelous (inaudible [01:35:43.834]) that I now stand on. And look to a future that is promising and that I bring promise to. 

01:35:50
ALLEN E. IVEY  Thank you so much, and we all know- (crosstalk) 

01:35:55
ONAWUMI JEAN MOSS Thanks. 

01:35:55
ALLEN E. IVEY - wonderful.
