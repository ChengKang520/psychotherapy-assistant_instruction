TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:50
JAY HALEY This is one of the series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapists as well as to change clients since they must learn on how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussions since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem-focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going in to do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor, but the clients cannot.

Brief Strategic Therapy with Couples 

00:02:10
JAY HALEY This training film illustrates therapy techniques which can be used with marriages in distress. To use the approach, it is best to hypothesize that marital relationships are based upon sequences of behavior which follow rules. These rules can be inferred from observation of repeating behavior by a couple. They are comprehensive in a couple’s interaction and they range from small issues to major crisis. For example, a husband will routinely behave irresponsibly. The wife will behave responsibly, and she’ll complain about the husband being irresponsible. They will follow this rule whenever they communicate. A rule like that is evident even when they visit the therapist. The wife will responsibly bring them into therapy when they’re in trouble. The husband will come reluctantly, not taking responsibility for their problems. Symptoms are the expression of a conflict of rules. A couple can follow rules that lead to pleasant experiences or they can repeat rules that are appropriate for distress. Behavior causes how people feel. The rules of relationships are difficult to change and the intervention of a therapist can be necessary to change the rules and so relieve their distress. Difficult interchanges are not often relieved by insight, since being aware of a rule doesn’t change it. For example, a therapist might say to a wife, “have you noticed that you followed the rule that you complain and your husband defend himself in almost everything you say.” The wife says, “that’s true. He never pays any attention to me.” The husband responds, “she complains and is dissatisfied no matter what I do.” The communication interchange is complete. She complains, he defends himself and then he withdraws. A goal of the therapy is to change these rules and so the distress. The goal is not to stop following rules, which is impossible, but to stop following those which are stable and cause misery. Since some viewers are unfamiliar with the power of rule-directed behavior, a more subtle version can be described. Spouses can have a pattern where the wife initiates what happens and the husband responds. Or they are reversed and the husband does the initiating. Nothing happens unless the wife initiates it. The husband is willing to respond but not to initiate something happening. Sometimes this pattern has its origin in courtship days. At that time a wife courts a man and makes everything interesting. The man responds, pleased with the wife making things happening. After marriage the wife feels the burden of initiating everything that happens. She wants the husband to initiate what happens. But he follows the rule that they had established, that he is only to respond. She becomes frustrated and he is exasperated, feeling his contract with her is being violated. Other examples of couples behaving according to the rules can be described. A couple can communicate and always escalate a disagreement. They behave as equals. Or the spouse follows the rule that one spouse takes care of the other. They behave unequally whatever they do. This film would show some rules which couples are trapped in, and it will emphasize the therapy interventions which can help. The techniques will include paradoxical interventions, which are effective in changing distressing rules. A working-class couple in their 30s, was referred to therapy by another couple who had been pleased with their therapy outcome. This couple was angry at each other and unhappy. The man was Mexican American and the wife a tall blonde who was American. So there were ethnic differences. They were not married but living together and planning someday to get married. They had a history of both being addicted to drugs and alcohol. They went through the 12-step program and now are clean but still think of themselves as addicts. The supervisory group discuss what they knew about the case before the couple had come in for their first interview. 

00:06:30
What do you think about (inaudible ) couples? 

00:06:33
How do I usually start? That's how I usually start is usually they'll start talking and then I'll just do more focusing you know. So you know, how would you describe what brought you here? And you know I ask the other one and I just start kind of like that. Do you have a suggestion? 

00:06:55
PLANNING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY Well, it’s always nice to try something different. You could ask him (inaudible ). If you ask the wife why they were here, what would she say? 

00:07:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:10
JAY HALEY And vice versa. 

00:07:10
Right, right! I haven't got the opportunity to try that. I'll try that. 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY But what you wanna do is assuming it’s a marital problem, you haven’t noticed what this is. It’s often they come in with such bad feelings that when you ask each of them what's the problem… 

00:07:25
They say (inaudible ). 

00:07:26
JAY HALEY Just like they come up with different problems. 

00:07:30
(inaudible ). 

00:07:35
JAY HALEY Maybe you don’t have the case really, except for the first interview. Which would be nice, I think. Every therapist should shoot for one session. 

00:07:45
That one session. 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY But they don't need… they don't need it. 

00:07:50
Right, right! So… 

00:07:55
JAY HALEY People come in for so many reasons. They come into see what it’s like. 

00:07:55
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:00
JAY HALEY They come into for a check up to see if there are any (inaudible ). 

00:08:02
I was thinking about a couple’s therapy. 

00:08:05
We could almost do it now. 

00:08:05
Yeah, we could. 

00:08:05
JAY HALEY It would be interesting if it’s a group that all knew each other. 

00:08:10
Yeah. 

00:08:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:10
JAY HALEY Instead of the usual group in which a lot of them know each other. 

00:08:10
Ah…Uh… 

00:08:10
OBSERVING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:08:15
JAY HALEY The supervisor thought the couple could think of themselves in a more positive way if the therapist asked the couple to imagine that they had never had a problem with drugs or alcohol. Neither could imagine being cured. The context in which the rules of the couple were expressed was a framework of thinking of themselves as defective, because they had been addicted. They believed they were not normal like other couples. Their in-laws encouraged that view, because of their addict history and were not helpful. The woman complained that she was having trouble with their relationship. This is what brought them in. She said he didn’t communicate, didn’t want sex, and didn’t show her affection and he made her very jealous. The man complained that the woman constantly complained and didn’t recognize that he was busy. He was a construction worker and also a musician, so he worked night and day. To do something about the woman’s complaining, a paradox was proposed. They had asked them to do what they were already doing. It was evident that the rule they followed was that the woman complained about the man and he defended himself. That was the rule imbedded in their relationship. This was a direct suggestion to the couple to change their rules. It was not paradoxical. Then they began to argue about issues like normal couples do around the house. He said she would be less overwhelmed if she went back to school or got a job. Both seemed overwhelmed at the idea they were normal. A paradox was given to this proud couple. They were avoiding sex, and to help them get over this problem, they were instructed to avoid sex. The first interview ended with the therapist suggesting to expect more from each other as normal couples do. 

00:10:20
DISCUSSING THE FIRST LIVE INTERVIEW 

00:10:20
At the end I was little worried that they weren’t going to come back even though they hadn’t given me any indication. They convinced me they were coming back. 

00:10:30
It seems a little bit for a woman to participate. 

00:10:30
Yeah! I mean, they’re here. Next week they were like, “we will(ph)!” Because I said, “well you have the number if anything comes up”, just saying stuff like that and he’s said, “oh, well, we don’t have any excuses. We’ll be here.” 

00:10:40
You know I've decided that he was flirting with you. 

00:10:45
Well, was I (inaudible )? 

00:10:48
No! 

00:10:48
Okay, good! Oh god (inaudible ) oh bingo. 

00:10:52
JAY HALEY Why is that good? 

00:10:55
Because I would feel really weird about that. It’s not my style. It’ll surprise me if I was being flirtatious with someone. 

00:11:00
JAY HALEY When working with couples, all you have is yourself, you know. 

00:11:05
Okay! Well, I’m not attracted to him. How about that? 

00:11:10
JAY HALEY Well, you don’t need to be attracted to him, but you could say to him, “I’m sure you know how to please a woman.” 

00:11:15
Oh then… Well, I said I’m sure you know how to please her. 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY Right! 

00:11:20
Yeah! 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY But you could put the nail into it by adding that. 

00:11:25
That’s true, but I have no… 

00:11:25
JAY HALEY I mean, you should think. Whatever you have you use. If you’re a pretty girl, you use that. If you are an older woman, you use that. If you are a male, you use that with males. If you get a… If it’s a girl, 19 years old, dealing with couples 50 years old, then you get helpless, so they’ll help you to achieve something. 

00:11:45
(Inaudible ). 

00:11:48
Neutrality Can Be Inappropriate. 

00:11:50
JAY HALEY The rule that you should be neutral is a real handicap in therapy, or that you shouldn’t side with either one. 

00:11:55
Well, I felt like I was being genuine, and I felt like I was being true to myself. When she came in, I kind of wished you could have been in the hallway still. She was so pissed when she came back in the room from being out in the waiting room alone. I mean, you should have seen her coming down the hall. 

00:12:10
JAY HALEY She was smoking off. She’s a jealous woman. 

00:12:15
Hmm…Hmm… Did you see that it was a little hard for me to send her out first? So, I was glad you suggested that I do that, because it was… I would have had her stay just out of my own comfort not wanting to like rock(ph) it too hard. 

00:12:25
JAY HALEY Well, there isn’t… there’s also a reason for that. You know every couple has rules they follow. 

00:12:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:30
JAY HALEY And this one follows the rule that she complains and he defends himself, we’ve already discussed. 

00:12:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY So, she expects to come in first and complain and then he can come in and defend himself. 

00:12:40
Right! Right, yeah. 

00:12:45
JAY HALEY You know, it’s best to do with the other… If you’re trying to break up that pattern… 

00:12:45
You have to do the opposite of what you are used to. 

00:12:50
JAY HALEY You do whatever you can, yeah. 

00:12:50
So, for me, with my being a kind of intuitive, and that’s kind of my style, I should basically sometimes just go flip my… my intuition? 

00:13:00
Well if your intuitions work smooth, make it smooth, if you wanna… if you wanna really come down the system. 

00:13:05
Right! That’s what I mean. Not that I would always ignore my intuition, but if I had my sense… My sense was I would have kept her in the room. So I was aware of the rule. 

00:13:15
JAY HALEY You were changing your rules. 

00:13:20
Right! 

00:13:20
Every Couple Has Rules 

00:13:20
JAY HALEY What’s the penalty for them to change their rules, you give them? Let's say ah… It’s an interesting problem. If you study the tape of that, the way they turn everything into that. 

00:13:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY I mean, you ask him to criticize her, and he makes a brave try 

00:13:35
Yeah. 

00:13:35
JAY HALEY And she makes a brave try to restrain herself, but then she complains and then he defends himself. 

00:13:40
Yeah! I tried! I really tried to hold her back. It was hard. So, what is their problem? 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:13:50
I mean, that's it? 

00:13:55
JAY HALEY Well, that’s it. 

00:13:55
That… That way that they relate? 

00:13:55
JAY HALEY Or at least that’s something you want to change 

00:14:00
Right! 

00:14:00
JAY HALEY Because it makes them miserable. If… If they were… If they were happy with that, it wouldn’t matter. 

00:14:05
That was the another point why I thought (inaudible ) the couple is and I felt it when I was in there talking about it. Like I was in the room with that first couple because she says, “I want him to talk”, and as soon as he does, she can’t stand it. She just hates… She just has to start you know her part. 

00:14:20
JAY HALEY She has to complain. 

00:14:20
Yeah! And I feel like, wow! It’s like we are from here to a long ways for them to even be able to hear each other at all. 

00:14:30
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:14:30
I mean, of other couples I’ve seen and everything they are, I’d probably say the least able to hear with each other, of any couple I've seen. 

00:14:35
JAY HALEY They must have had quite a history of those things. 

00:14:40
I'm ready to (inaudible ) married. 

00:14:46
They are not married. 

00:14:46
No, they are not married. So, it’s just four years. 

00:14:46
They started talking about getting married about two years ago. 

00:14:50
Hmm… 

00:14:50
And they’d been together four years. 

00:14:50
No kids? 

00:14:55
There's a ten-year-old in the house. 

00:14:55
Oh! 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ) a couple gets mad at each other, will have somebody playing them off. 

00:15:00
Oh, that’s right. 

00:15:00
JAY HALEY Against each other, in someway. It's usually the mother-in-law. 

00:15:05
Yeah! Well, then the other thing was you know, he doesn’t want to marry me (inaudible ). You know now he won't… I’m not good enough for him to marry me. You know, that whole thing is in there. So you would just bring it in to talk about it or you would invite those people in? 

00:15:20
JAY HALEY I would the next time, but I would talk about it and then invite them in. 

00:15:20
Hmm… 

00:15:25
JAY HALEY Really some of the thing we’re doing (inaudible ) we talk about it and then bring her in. 

00:15:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:15:30
JAY HALEY But anytime when a couple is not married, it’s certainly something, some third person has to bring them out. Sometimes it's a therapist or a group or something. They react to giving up therapy I couldn't tell. 

00:15:45
Well the way I phrased I never chose getting that way you suggested, but ah… what it would take for this to be the last therapy, because that’s what you're talking about? Ah… He said she would trust me. And he elaborated a little bit on that. And she said he’d talk to me, he’d look at me, he’d trust me. Oh, respect was the big thing. Yeah, respect, and then she said trust and I was trying to bring it together and dealt so that we could end. That’s a trust. 

00:16:15
JAY HALEY (inaudible ), they really talk about it a little bit. What’s your plan? 

00:16:20
PLANNING THE SECOND INTERVIEW A WEEK LATER 

00:16:20
Well, I was hoping for a little more feedback from the group after the sessions that we've had so far. But my plan is to ask them. Actually, I feel like they’re just going to come in and tell me about the sex, whether they did or didn’t, because I told them not to… to abstain because of the tension and blah, blah, blah. Ah… That's… That’s what I had hypothesized will happen. 

00:16:45
JAY HALEY Oh! If you didn’t… You don’t wanna hear it, is that it? 

00:16:50
Yeah! I… I… I just think that they are just not going to have been able to resist the fact that I told them not to and they are just going to have sex this week which was one of the primary presenting problems. I mean, we've heard about that before they were even our clients. 

00:17:10
Hmm…Hmm… So that’s real progress if they have had some good sex. That’s great. 

00:17:15
Yeah. I mean, I’m still kind of surprised about the reaction, even though I understand theoretically how it works everything, I’m still, they just did exactly that. They just went against me like that. It was great. 

00:17:30
JAY HALEY If you wanted to carry that on, you could start by saying, one thing I’d rather not talked about your sex, because that’s a person’s private life. So let’s talk about something else. 

00:17:40
And then what? You think they’ll resist that? 

00:17:40
JAY HALEY Well, they would try to talk to you about sex. It’s the same principle. Well, what do you think you have to solve to be done with them? 

00:17:50
Well, that’s what I was wondering about too, because I remembered that sex was one of the main issues. The only other issue that they really presented was the criticisms. They didn’t even call it that, but he called it shutting down, that he would shut down and not talk, and she would say he won’t talk to me. That was the only real thing that they really put out there that they don’t like about their relationship, besides from sex. So, I just have to figure a way to go with that. Or ask them to, again, if I spend the first period of time with the sex issue saying, well, you don’t… let’s not talk about that, but then they do. 

00:18:35
JAY HALEY What you don’t want to do is reward them for cooperating with you about sex by dismissing them. 

00:18:40
Right, right! What do you mean just dismissing them? 

00:18:45
JAY HALEY Well, if you say, don’t you have any other problems, like you are through with them after they have just done what you wanted them to do. 

00:18:50
So what would be other response? 

00:18:50
JAY HALEY You could go at it a little differently and say that therapy is for people who can’t solve problems for themselves. And you solved this, you could probably solve other things yourselves. So you’re talking about them doing better rather than you rejecting them. 

00:19:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:15
JAY HALEY But I think it’s helpful to have clear goals. One of the clear goals was up there when she complains and he objects and then withdraws. 

00:19:20
The goal of therapy is to change the couple’s rules. It cannot be done by simple directives. 

00:19:25
I saw that he could function differently when I had told him to complain and I expected him not to do very well at it. He was quite good at complaining towards her. But that’s not the way they normally interact. So I'm not… I don't have a good idea about how it… 

00:19:40
JAY HALEY Which one do you think it’s worse of? 

00:19:45
Well, I feel like… I don't see you asked me that question before, some other time, because I think they’re both bad off in different ways. I think she is ah… more angry and has a lot of self-pity. Ah… She's pretty. I see her very selfish about it ah… what's going on there. And then I see him as… I see him as selfish too. He you know, well she needs to just get over it, if she’s (inaudible ) different then I’d be you know she thinks she's accepting the way I am and just things like that. 

00:20:15
JAY HALEY I don’t think that is a good way to think about it. You should have a different theory. 

00:20:20
Okay! What? 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY I don’t know, but a better one than that. That’s very negative, that they’re both selfish really. 

00:20:30
What do you mean when you say worse off? 

00:20:35
JAY HALEY Well, I mean, who do you think may not make it home tonight or should I see them alone because they seem in real trouble or something like that. 

00:20:45
I’d say to her. 

00:20:45
Protection Theory is Described 

00:20:45
JAY HALEY And I think that’s a better theory. It’s something to do with protection. That when she begins to fall apart, he does something that makes her angry and complaining, and then she pulls out of it and she’s human again for a while. I think she is unhappy in her life, generally, more than he is. And ah… I think he helps her by misbehaving. 

00:21:15
Because it gives her something to focus on or? 

00:21:15
JAY HALEY That’s not necessarily true. You need a theory to operate from, but it doesn’t have to be a true one. It’s you… These days there’s no truth. So you just need a good operational theory to make sure you get better and better (inaudible ). And I think that’s how she developed a career or something, he would relate to her differently because he wouldn’t have to hold her up. 

00:21:45
Because I think her following him to the club to hear him play music is… 

00:21:50
JAY HALEY Her respond to being called an artist. 

00:21:50
Yeah! I wanted to ask you more about ah… ‘cos I heard you to find it that way a couple of times where you know artists (inaudible ) we were with your client at that time. 

00:22:02
JAY HALEY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:02
She can think of him as an artist deserving respect instead of only irresponsible. 

00:22:05
Artists are different kind of people and just write that is you know that makes the unique situation for their relationship. I mean, I wanted to understand more why were you telling about that? 

00:22:15
JAY HALEY However they are defining him and it’s a wrong one, you're trying to renegotiate it into a different one. 

00:22:25
And you just found that artist works because they? 

00:22:25
JAY HALEY Well he’s an artist, he’s a drummer. We can do the same thing with a kid. Now he’s 12 years old and you can’t expect the same things from a 12-year-old you would a 13 or 11. So you have to treat the 12-year-old in a special way, because he is different from the other kids. 

00:22:40
Hmm…Hmm… I see what you are saying. 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY I mean, you just reclassify him. 

00:22:45
You just pick something that they already have as their identity. 

00:22:45
JAY HALEY That's right! And try to make it a positive thing you know. I guess that she was the group(ph) with him, she met him. 

00:22:55
She said she wasn't. She was not just one of those women. 

00:23:00
JAY HALEY Yeah! That she probably worries about all the time. 

00:23:00
Right! What you said is right. That’s right! 

00:23:05
So, I could get more into her what she does during the day? 

00:23:10
JAY HALEY Sure! 

00:23:10
 And I just felt that she does anything. She said she waits for him to come home. 

00:23:15
Let's not practice complain. (inaudible ) mastery without saying practice. 

00:23:21
Oh no, no, no she watches kids in her home. 

00:23:25
That's right. 

00:23:25
She watches kids in her home. 

00:23:25
That's right. 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY She can do better than that. She has the thought of I know you never did it in the way we(ph) go back to school or picking up ah… type of career or something. How we get into sort of lies(ph) of what she could do that would be more interesting than she is doing now. 

00:23:50
Knowing her and him knowing her and what does he think. 

00:23:50
I want you to bring that up, I want you to get to that. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY I would just say to him, you seem to be doing very well. What about your wife? What could she do more to make herself happier? Do it very straightforwardly. Because if you have a hypothesis that he is holding her up and it is distressing the way he does it to her, then you think of some other way she can get held up. You use yourself for one thing. She will think of you as a professional career woman. And you’ve got to use that without putting her down but while stirring her up that women these days are doing all sorts of things that you would never expect. Most women are dissatisfied unless they have something that really occupies them outside their home. Let’s just keep in mind she hears you saying that. 

00:24:50
Right! I understand. 

00:24:50
JAY HALEY And that you don’t want to put her down by saying I did and you are not. Are they here? 

00:25:05
They might be. 

00:25:05
JAY HALEY Well we'll see. 

00:25:10
They might be (inaudible ). 

00:25:11
OBSERVING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:25:11
JAY HALEY The therapist saw them together and also each alone. She did not complain but talked about the difficulties of life. They began to discuss her fears of being overwhelmed and relapsing. He was asked to complain and her to defend herself as a way of changing the rules. 

00:25:30
JAY HALEY She went 30 minutes without uttering a complaint against him. 

00:25:35
Yeah the first part. 

00:25:35
DISCUSSING THE SECOND INTERVIEW 

00:25:35
She went on almost over session until you brought that up. 

00:25:40
Yeah I know that's what I mean I was going to say that and in part it seemed like the first half or last half disappointed it that that was the end. I would have rather that been at the beginning. 

00:25:50
JAY HALEY But she was just not complaining. Actually, it was when could they be curable came up that she began to complain. 

00:26:00
She's not ready for… 

00:26:00
Well, he complained pretty darn harshly when I said, imagine that you don’t have drugs or alcohol as a problem. And he said, Well, that’s who I am. Well, I am you know I understood what you were saying, but he got he was really I mean he really took a stand on that more than I have heard him take a stand on some other topics. 

00:26:20
Usually with a dedicated 12-stepper you are really attacking their value system. 

00:26:25
Right. 

00:26:25
You really are. 

00:26:25
And I think of that 

00:26:30
JAY HALEY But the problem is that it’s two competing therapies. There are different ideologies, there are different expectations, and there’s a different approaches. And it’s like having a co-therapy with somebody that has a different ideology. 

00:26:40
No, I think if you, if you, if you take what they bring and use it, I think you can work it. 

00:26:50
What I am struggling with is I don’t know that 12 steps or whatever is the only way to get from A to B. 

00:26:55
It's not. What I’m suggesting is… 

00:26:55
She's not working on the program anyway. 

00:27:00
Yeah. 

00:27:00
JAY HALEY Well, that’s a question whether you should discuss Hispanic males to him. 

00:27:05
What could be you know… 

00:27:05
That's American. 

00:27:10
What’s it like for him to be one? 

00:27:10
Ethnicity Issue 

00:27:10
With his Hispanic background to have to deal with her points of view being American. Because I guess she didn’t grow up thinking you know that woman has to do this and that. 

00:27:20
She said she did grow up thinking that women has to do. That’s what she’s pushing. That’s why I got the feeling she’s pushing harder to be that traditional role of the woman in the home than he was. This man is saying, I’ll do the dishes. He was just saying, I’m not going to take control of the house and tell myself to go do it, but if you tell me to do it, I’ll do it. 

00:27:40
I actually think he was saying, I’ll do you this favor every once in a while if I am in a good mood. That I mean that’s that mindset. It’s not that he’s not going do it but every once in a while I will do that favor. I mean that's the mindset. 

00:27:55
That’s what my dad does. Once a month he’ll do the dishes, and we have to applaud him…. 

00:27:55
Exactly, yeah! 

00:28:00
Then he tells everybody I help out around the house. 

00:28:00
Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:05
I have a husband like that. No, he’s not Hispanic, but he’s got a cultural thing going there-traditional. 

00:28:15
JAY HALEY Of course. But it is a question whether to bring that up as an explanation. She must have put some thought on this too-that she’s involved with a Hispanic. 

00:28:25
So what… So… I wonder where I am going? 

00:28:30
JAY HALEY Well I would bring that up (inaudible ) because being Hispanic makes him a special person, and she can’t take it as personally as she does. When he does certain things it’s just a cultural thing. 

00:28:45
Hmm…Hmm…. So we are trying to build more acceptance in each of them? 

00:28:50
JAY HALEY Sure! To make her more tolerant of him because it isn’t a response to her-it’s in his nature. 

00:29:00
Right. 

00:29:00
JAY HALEY If you decide to go that way. 

00:29:00
I didn’t put it in words that they could… I wasn’t clear enough. 

00:29:05
JAY HALEY You want them to expect more of each other by expecting less of each other. 

00:29:10
Yes! Expect more of themselves, yes. But I couldn’t get that across in a way that they got a hold of. I got a feeling that they got really confused. 

00:29:20
JAY HALEY That’s okay! You know one thing they responded to you very well was you being positive-about them improving. 

00:29:25
Oh, their body language. 

00:29:25
JAY HALEY She looked delighted, really. She took it like a personal compliment. And I think she is thinking of therapy is a place where you go to improve, and I think he thinks it is place where you go because she says to go. 

00:29:40
Well, once he said, I don’t think you can ever please a woman, but if this will do it, okay. That’s right, he did say that. You can never please a woman. That was funny. 

00:29:50
JAY HALEY Is that Hispanic? 

00:29:50
Oh my gosh, no. 

00:29:55
Isn’t that male? 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
Was there anything different that I could say or you know, was I sitting okay? I don’t know. 

00:30:15
JAY HALEY Who has a mother? 

00:30:15
She does. 

00:30:20
JAY HALEY And the mother lives where? 

00:30:20
I didn’t ask. But she said we went walking. That's the first… That's why I was telling ohh… mother! 

00:30:25
JAY HALEY It’s an interesting question whether to bring her in. 

00:30:30
Oh, into the session? 

00:30:30
JAY HALEY If it’s not going the way you would like it to, you could bring somebody else in. But I think it is going well. You could do without it. But if you want to get further into a complicated cultural marriage, then she might help. I don’t know whether he could tolerate having both women in there jumping on him-and a female therapist at that. 

00:30:55
He would be out of it and looking down. 

00:30:55
JAY HALEY Well, let’s not bring in others next time. But I think they are improving. I was impressed with her lack of complaining. It was extraordinary. 

00:31:05
It’s a big change. 

00:31:05
Oh yeah! 

00:31:05
JAY HALEY I think it was good to bring them together complaining, in the sense that it came around to what is a very important issue, that is whether they are curable or not. Or whether they can ever be comfortable about ah… being overwhelmed or whatever. 

00:31:25
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:31:25
JAY HALEY I mean, that was a good way to put it-that if she gets overwhelmed she would turn to drinking. Because then she talks about all the ways she gets overwhelmed. But there is something that he doesn’t expect of her because she might blow it. And I think it’s the same with her. Once they are defined that way, they’re not going to expect as much. So anyhow I would start with them in some way to find out if this is their last session. 

00:31:50
Okay. 

00:31:55
JAY HALEY And one way to do it is, is the classical, what if this was our last session, what would you be worried about? 

00:32:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:00
PLANNING THE THIRD INTERVIEW Disengagement 

00:32:00
JAY HALEY And if they get upset and say, my last session? Then you say, well I didn’t say it was your last session, I just said what if it was. 

00:32:05
Hmm…Hmm… Hmm…Hmm… 

00:32:05
JAY HALEY But people go right to a problem, usually, if you do that. 

00:32:10
Yes we saw that happen. 

00:32:10
Yeah that's true! 

00:32:10
JAY HALEY It’s a classic. But if not that way, then you try to think of some other way to give them a chance to be normal. You could say, well, let’s have a session on how normal you are. 

00:32:25
We did that. I remember they couldn’t get into that normal concept very well. 

00:32:30
JAY HALEY Because… Id didn’t remember that. 

00:32:30
They identified themselves as recovered drug addicts. 

00:32:35
JAY HALEY Oh, that’s the problem. 

00:32:35
And that's they are proud of that being their identity, because they have overcome that. So, the whole normal thing was there. 

00:32:45
JAY HALEY Well there's a difficulty that I don’t know whether your clients will have. I’m not an enthusiast for an approach that says somebody is incurable and that they are going to be diseased the rest of their life. I don’t think that is a good thing to impose on people, but it’s the common way to treat addicts, and that the 12-step program and all. I would rather not work that way, because I think they are helped without being indicted. I mean, if a father in a family says, I’m an alcoholic and you ask him when he had a drink last, and he says, 14 years ago, that means his family has been with him as a patient or as a damaged person for 14 years, which I think is a thing you shouldn’t impose on people unless you have to. There are some alcoholics obviously that live with it day to day, and you hold them up and that’s it. But most of them I think can have a good outcome if you do something about their social situation-their families, their friends and so on. Now, with the issue that came up here-even if they could be perfectly normal, or they are always going to be abnormal. And that’s a problem, because ah… when we're not successful, that’s fine, but it often is not successful and you just have an unhappy person who feels they’re hopeless and they could stay off the booze but they are hopeless to ever do anything about it. Anyhow, it’s a mixture. That’s a therapy of it’s own that has a separate set of ideas and principles and steps. When you mix it with family therapy, you have a problem, because it’s a different set, you drink because you are involved with somebody who’s making you drink in family therapy theory. That the drinking is a… is a… is a product of the social situation, not just the individual’s weaknesses. And that’s a very different way of working. And it’s an awkward thing to collaborate. But you can do it. But I wouldn’t tell you… If somebody has stopped drinking and had difficulties stopping and is pleased to have stopped, the fact they call themselves diseased-I would let go. I mean, why not? Your goal is to keep them from drinking, really, and ruining their lives. They keep talking about the difficult life of the addicts. But the fact is they’ve got wives and they’ve got children and they’ve got in-laws and all the situations of addicts. And the family therapy has been pretty successful with addicts. I like to turn people lose when they are normal-as far as the problem they came in with. And this is the problem with them, because they can’t think of themselves as normal apparently. 

00:35:30
Right. 

00:35:30
JAY HALEY So, I am sure that one of you people has a solution for this. What do you recommend? I mean… You’re supposed to say to them, what if this was their last session? 

00:35:45
What they are doing is, they are… both are in need so that the other can take care of you know he… he… She’s very verbal about that her needs aren’t been met. And ah… Hence I’m not sure if that’s just to keep him with somebody that needs him you know. And then they did still… She still seemed to be complaining, although less about him. 

00:36:10
JAY HALEY What if they do say they need help and they want more therapy and they are not getting along? What’s the next possible step? 

00:36:20
Next possible step? 

00:36:25
JAY HALEY When we have a case where it’s not going the way you like it and your whole is little bigger? 

00:36:30
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:36:30
JAY HALEY I would think of bringing in his mother. 

00:36:30
Well, I was wondering about that. I was wondering about bringing… And there is a daughter in the picture we’ve never even discussed. 

00:36:35
JAY HALEY How old is the daughter? 

00:36:35
Ten. And there was the marriage issue. She mentioned that, too. You know, that they’re not married and that the mom, her mom wants him to get married. It was real similar to that first case. So, there’s a lot of stuff still out there. 

00:36:50
When Therapy is not Progressing Bring in More People 

00:36:50
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ). 

00:36:51
You know, I don’t know. 

00:36:51
JAY HALEY And ah… if you were going to bring in the mother which one would you bring in? 

00:36:55
Well I thought of hers, just because that's the one they've mentioned. But I don't even know anything about his mom and I've really not asked. 

00:37:00
JAY HALEY That would by now. 

00:37:05
Okay! What would you… For what purpose? I've gotto go and see for that(ph). 

00:37:10
JAY HALEY I would just say, ah… if they are still having problems, that you would like to see some more of the family. If one of their mothers comes in and advice you on how to help them. 

00:37:25
Tell them that? 

00:37:25
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:37:25
Oh cool, okay! Well I’m going to go see. They are probably here. They are usually pretty prompt. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:37:40
JAY HALEY Whatever they say is the problem, you should deal with it. 

00:37:40
So your relationship… You guys are still talking about the relationship on whether it will continue? 

00:37:45
JAY HALEY The therapist was surprised that the couple reported that things were going so well. After the discussion, she suggested they come back in six months, which was agreeable to them. 

00:38:00
JAY HALEY That was very good! 

00:38:05
That was of course. 

00:38:05
JAY HALEY Let’s talk about it. 

00:38:05
That was exciting to see how much they were changed. 

00:38:10
JAY HALEY It was extraordinary, really. 

00:38:10
I’m amazed. They were, they were moving… I mean they still did some of their same stuff. But I mean she’s backed off, and he’s stepped up and… How did that happen? It was so different. I mean, you should have seen them before. She was crying all the time. I mean, it was just completely different. I mean, they were smiling and everything. None of that- he goes mad and she was crying and… had him all time and he was shut down and I’m dripping(ph). I am! I’m just amazed that they were so happy. That was great. Thank you. And that works great. 

00:38:50
JAY HALEY You liked it? 

00:38:50
I do. I wouldn’t have thought that I did, but it was so easy. And then I could just insert it like right in the moment where it’s easy. 

00:38:55
JAY HALEY Yeah, there was one that was just in the flow of what you were saying. 

00:39:00
Yeah! It worked really good. 

00:39:00
What you think of it Jay? 

00:39:05
JAY HALEY I think it’s a good idea. I think it’s limited compared with the telephone, but an advantage (inaudible ). 

00:39:11
Sure, yeah! 

00:39:11
JAY HALEY You can get more ideas over in a telephone. 

00:39:15
Yeah. 

00:39:15
JAY HALEY You can do something and then say this is the reason for doing that. And that's hard to do here unless you either speak. 

00:39:20
Yeah. 

00:39:20
DISCUSSING THE THIRD INTERVIEW 

00:39:20
Well what I was thinking… What I liked about that being one sentence is that I could just literally look at it. See it I didn't have to you know read the text and try to comprehend and put it. It was just you know one liner. 

00:39:35
JAY HALEY That’s right! That would be like having a book and you… 

00:39:35
Right. 

00:39:35
JAY HALEY What gave you such confidence in six months? How were they behaving that you liked? 

00:39:45
I don’t know. Did I think of that on my own? 

00:39:45
JAY HALEY Yeah, you said six months. I was thinking three weeks. 

00:39:45
Because we were all surprised. I don’t know where I got that from. 

00:39:50
JAY HALEY Well, I would trust it. 

00:39:55
Maybe you were thinking in relation to how long you would be here? 

00:39:55
Yeah! Well, I guess I was thinking if that… that their faces would contort if that… I didn’t want to make it too short. So I’d rather make it long and make them go, oh or something. 

00:40:05
JAY HALEY Six months is really a cure. 

00:40:10
That is a really long time. It was obvious. You know what I mean? It wasn’t like I had to force them. 

00:40:15
JAY HALEY Well, it was not obvious here, but it’s an example of how the mirrors screen things out. You get a different picture back here than in there. 

00:40:20
And that’s why Jay said you should decide, because he said she's getting something different in there that we're not. 

00:40:25
Yeah! Well, I threw it out there, and she was like, we’ll call if we need you. 

00:40:30
JAY HALEY It’s the correct thing to do. He was a little hesitant. He was willing to come in six months. I think he likes you. 

00:40:40
I liked them. I thought they were nice people. 

00:40:45
JAY HALEY And she gets along with you very well, too. I mean, the transformation has been considerable. But anyhow, you can always give them a call on a week or month or six weeks or whenever you feel like it. 

00:40:55
Really? I don’t usually do that. 

00:41:00
JAY HALEY You should. Make sure things are okay. Sometimes they are okay and you have them in for one session or two and send them out again. 

00:41:05
Well, okay. 

00:41:10
JAY HALEY You should always do a follow-up to keep a record of your successes. 

00:41:15
Okay. I just don’t want to feel like I was putting myself in their lives. 

00:41:20
JAY HALEY If you see them in three months, they will be having trouble remembering you. Or if you see them in six months, certainly. 

00:41:30
Oh, I don’t know. I mean, do you feel like I kicked them out too soon? 

00:41:30
JAY HALEY No, no. I think you should always follow your impulses, and I think you were correct. I would have done it because of some other theory, that you should do it from two or three weeks then a month and then three months. But when they when they change, you take advantage of that. Because they feel so much better that you said six months you know then if you said three weeks they would have been partially feeling better. But also one of the things about therapies these days has changed. It used to be you should specialize, like in child therapy and never see an adult. But nowadays, because of the economic situation that’s one reason you really have to be able to handle any kind of a problem. And you should be able to handle kids’ problems and the parents’ problems of the kid and marital difficulties, and you should be able to do some sex therapy. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert on it, but you should read up on it to be able to participate with them in doing something that will start something a little different. 

00:42:30
Therapists Should be Generalists 

00:42:30
JAY HALEY That is, you shouldn’t just assume well I'll refer. We used to refer everything. Everybody has a specialist, and you refer everybody to that specialist. But now you have to be a generalist. 

00:42:45
Hmm…Hmm… They did want me to tell you all thank you. 

00:42:50
JAY HALEY Well, good. 

00:42:50
DISCUSSING OUTCOME 

00:42:55
JAY HALEY Take each case and say what is the outcome. Have I succeeded with this case or failed with this case? Or, on the scale of zero to ten, are they at zero and need improvement or are they at ten? And it’s fair, if you brought a case in, through the course of the case to either succeed or fail or halfway fail. But if you see them just once and you don’t see them again, it has to be a great interview. But I just thought you might be interested in looking at your own work and seeing how complicated it is to do a simple study- with whether somebody got over a problem or didn’t get over a problem. I think what’s happening in therapy, as you all know, is there is much more focus on problems and solving them in brief therapy and so on. And the research was complicated on the outcome when it was deep therapy that went on for months or years. And they never formulated a problem, so how could they study it and decide that there had been improvement? And now that you are forced to that the thinking is shifting to there is a problem and you have to formulate it, and you have to make an intervention, and you have to see if you’ve got a change. So the outcome research is changing now. 

00:44:15
Changing to what? 

00:44:20
JAY HALEY It’s changing now to a briefer… a better possibility of doing outcome study, because you formulate a clear problem, hopefully. You see them for a short period of time, so it isn’t a long period so that you have forgotten what they originally came for. And have a brief therapy. 

00:44:40
I don't know. I mean, they seemed… I know it’s funny, I think because it was the only case that I have had that was that brief, sometimes I still feel weird about it. 

00:44:50
They looked so happy. 

00:44:50
I know. 

00:44:50
And they chose six months to follow-up. 

00:44:50
Yeah. 

00:44:55
If she was hurting, she would have called you. She would have been on the phone. 

00:44:55
She said, If we need some work you know if we need any work, we will call. 

00:45:00
(inaudible ). 

00:45:05
So I… 

00:45:05
I have… I have to (inaudible ). 

00:45:06
I don’t know. 

00:45:10
JAY HALEY It’s up to you. 

00:45:10
Oh man! Ah… I’m trying to think they were having sex again, they were talking positively, she was smiling not crying. 

00:45:25
JAY HALEY That’s a big step. 

00:45:25
I know. She was… They were joking with each other and I guess I would give them a…. So I’ve got to give him like an eight or a nine. Okay, nine… Eight and a half. 

00:45:40
All right, we are up to nine. 

00:45:45
JAY HALEY When’s the next one? This training video has illustrated different intervention techniques within a social context. The couple came in with a history of being addicts. They were now recovered, but are influenced by that addict history. One effect of the scars of addiction included a fear that if they get upset they could relapse and be addicted again. Therefore they do not provoke each other to an extreme. Within that framework the therapy took place. The couple were seen together as well as individually. The therapist planned to see them briefly and began to disengage from the first interview. She completed the sessions in three interviews. This plan was based on the extensive therapy they had experienced, which contributed to their idea that they were defective in some way, because of their therapy history. They could not think of themselves as a normal couple. The therapy focused on the rules of the relationship which the couple followed, that left them exasperated with each other. The focus of the therapy was on changing those rules. The simple rule they followed was that she complained and he defended himself. She protested that he neglected her, and he defended himself by pointing out how hard he worked. She complained he was irresponsible. He said she was too responsible. She said he was avoiding her and neglecting her. He said he was too tired. The basic motivation of the couple was assumed to be protective. For example, the wife would become depressed and the husband would act up, and she would feel that he was at fault and so she would feel better. The interventions were simple and included both direct and indirect directives. The couple were seen separately as well as together. The wife responded with jealously when the husband was seen alone with the therapist. A directive was used that was direct. The husband was asked to criticize the wife and she was to defend herself. A paradoxical variation on this intervention was when the wife was asked to criticize the husband and he was to defend himself. This was their rule that they came in to get rid of, and it was paradoxical to ask them to do what they wished to stop doing. Another simple example was built on their avoidance of sex. The therapist told them that sex was forbidden for this week. Thus they were asked to avoid what they were avoiding. They responded appropriately. The rules in this case were simple ones and the interventions were simple. Improvement was measured in the last session. The therapist was pleased with the outcome when the couple reported their changes. She recessed them for a period of time. The changes apparently continued.
