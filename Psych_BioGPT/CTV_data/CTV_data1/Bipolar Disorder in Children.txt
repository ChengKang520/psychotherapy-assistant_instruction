00:00:25
WINNE KING One minute your child is giddy with laughter. The next, she is raging or crying, what’s going on. Find out next on keeping kids healthy.

Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:00:40
WINNIE KING, M.D. Hello, I’m Dr. Winnie King and I’m here with some experts on childhood mood disorders in the lobby of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. Now, your child is on top of the world laughing, excited, full of confidence. Next thing, you know, he’s talking about suicide that there might be tantrums, crying, even threats of violence, what could possibly be happening? Well, the answer might be bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depression that the diagnosis in children has increased in the past 10 years, but there are still some question about what exactly the symptoms are. Now, 12-year old Kevin has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and he told us what its like from the inside. 

00:01:25
[sil.] 

00:01:30
KEVIN REARDON Age 12 I go to cycling everyday. You start out happy at the top. You, you crash down to the bottom, go to the middle where its um, a normal and then you go real…got really happy then you crash down, and you do that over and over again. 

00:01:45
LORETTA REARDON Kevin’s Mother In first grade, that was the year that we got actually had him evaluated by a psychiatrist. That was the first time where he was actually banging his head against the wall um, saying that he wanted to be Dad, get me knife, ah… I want to stab myself um, and things like that. I mean the children just don’t say things like that. 

00:02:00
KEVIN REARDON For some reason, you mind tells you, “you don’t want to feel about it, you only feel this way that really, you don’t and you trying to want to get better , but your mind overcomes your whole body and tells you not to. When you’re angry, you don’t want anybody help you, you just gets so mad and you just want to destroy everything. 

00:02:20
LORETTA REARDON We have had problems with him in the public school umm…where he would kick his chair over, he would be defying to the teacher. He will say, you know, I know better than you and sometimes, he would umm…throw things. He came to a point where the school was not able to umm….have him in the classroom anymore. 

00:02:35
KEVIN REARDON I’ve done so many things. I’ve thrown things. I’ve picked up knives and threatened. I’ve punched people. I’ve, but I never actually really tried to actually hurt somebody. I wanna throw punches, (inaudible ) chest, so I don’t hurt people. I never go for the face and I tried to and scare people wise. I can be myself and calm down. 

00:03:00
LORETTA REARDON If he felt in anyway threatened by himself or if he felt angry in a way, sometimes he would pull out a knife. He’ll pick up a brick. Those are the scariest times. Umm…those are the times that I know umm…sometimes you can’t always talk him out of it. It sounds like he shuts down a little bit and he can’t think and it’s really that he needs you to stay away, go inside himself and figure out where he needs to go to get out of this feeling of anger. Umm….I don’t think he really intends to hurt anybody. I think he knows the difference between umm… this is wrong, but I don’t know el… anyway else how to do it. 

00:03:35
KEVIN REARDON You remember some parts and you remember the bad parts what you did, but you don’t remember how it started or like how it moved down. But it’s like a bad dream. 

00:03:50
LORETTA REARDON He can extremely giddy and happy and it gets to be overly happy. 

00:03:55
KEVIN REARDON It’s feeling better than you could ever feel before. You just feel a little like compassion of everything, everything around you, and then when you get mad, you feel like hating everything around you, but when you’re really, really happy, you can get mad even much easier, so you got, I’m really vulnerable and I’m really happy. 

00:04:05
LORETTA REARDON The mood swings with Kevin, and it happened pretty quickly. 

00:04:15
KEVIN REARDON It’s hard, it is…it’s like you know it’s going to happen, you don’t know when it’s gonna happen, but it just happens. It’s like having two different like your brain just spin up. One is in good side and one is in bad side and umm… one side is telling you, don’t get mad, and in those such time you get mad, so it’s a constant war in your head. I don’t really think about ah…what did happen that day, I just let see whether, how the days is going to go on. I just go with the day. 

00:04:45
LORETTA REARDON He such a bright kid. He loves the outdoors. He loves rocks and bugs and hiking and fishing and he is really is a type of person that finds so many wonderful joys of life and this is just a side of him that umm….,you know, he is learning to live with, we all are learning to live with it, it’s a daily struggle every day. 

00:05:00
WINNE KING Well, Kevin and his mom are here with us. And Kevin, do you feel like you’ve managed to get control over those explosions with time? 

00:05:10
KEVIN REARDON Well umm…no not everyone most of them really helps, but before I managed and it wouldn’t, I wasn’t control of anyone, anytime. 

00:05:20
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:05:20
KEVIN REARDON But now, if I managed and I’m in capable of controlling some of them. 

00:05:25
WINNE KING Some of them, but not all of them. 

00:05:25
KEVIN REARDON Not all of them. 

00:05:25
WINNE KING Yeah, you’re appreciated, you're being honest about that because we really won’t understand how this affects people. Well, I want you to meet Dr. Gay Carlson(ph). She teaches psychiatry in pediatrics at Stony Brook University of School of Medicine. And Gay(ph), you know we’ve seen what this looks like, but what exactly is bipolar disorder and how is it different in children? 

00:05:45
GABRIELLE CARLSON M.D. Stony Brook University School of Medicine Bipolar disorder is a diagnosis and for people that don’t understand what diagnosis means, it’s a group of signs, it’s of symptoms and behaviors that hang together in a consistent way that hopefully allows us to predict what kind of treatment and future the person will have. Bipolar disorder started out as way to classify depression, series depression, very sad low mood, ah…hating yourself, but having a real reason to do so, having no energy, wishing you’re dead, not being able to thing straight, because your thoughts were so slowed. Doctors began to realize that there were some people who had opposite parts with their depression. They had instead of a low mood are really high and elated mood, instead of low energy, excessive energy, instead of feeling terrible about themselves, they were grandiose, they felt supremely powerful instead of not ah…instead of sleeping all the time, they couldn’t sleep at all. And so that’s how this…this diagnosis of bipolar disorder got born. 

00:06:45
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:45
GABRIELLE CARLSON In adults, they have periods of depression, mania, and then they come back to normal. In those periods lasts for several weeks, even several months. 

00:06:50
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:55
GABRIELLE CARLSON In children, especially children below the age of 12, those episode seem like they’re much faster. 

00:07:00
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:07:00
GABRIELLE CARLSON They’re much shorter, ah…there are many other things for it to be confused with, which is part of the problem with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 

00:07:05
WINNE KING Well, is this something that kids are born with? 

00:07:10
GABRIELLE CARLSON Probably, it’s a… it seems it’s a genetic disorder and so the genes for it are gonna be present from birth. 

00:07:10
WINNE KING Well, I know there…there appears to be some controversy about this diagnosis in children and whether or not the rages represent ah…the, the extremes of emotion in bipolar right? 

00:07:25
GABRIELLE CARLSON Think of rages like a high fever. You can get a high fever in a number of different disorders. If you have high fever, it’s serious… 

00:07:30
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:30
GABRIELLE CARLSON …it doesn’t mean it’s a diagnosis. 

00:07:35
WINNE KING Right. 

00:07:35
GABRIELLE CARLSON The same thing is true for rages. People gonna have rages when they’re manic, they can have rages when they’re depressed. They can have rages when they’re anxious, they can have rages when they’re autistic, they can have rages when they’re oppositional defiant. They can have rages when they’re schizophrenic. 

00:07:45
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:45
GABRIELLE CARLSON So the fact is rages is a serious problem, but it does not necessarily mean the person’s bipolar. 

00:07:50
WINNE KING And ah…child that is bipolar can also have other diagnosis as well that can sort of co-exist at the same time. 

00:08:00
GABRIELLE CARLSON That’s right and that’s where the term comorbidity comes from. You can have… you can have a diagnosis that looks like bipolar disorder that isn’t, bipolar disorder can look like something else and you can have two disorders at the same time, one of which is bipolar disorder. 

00:08:15
WINNE KING Well that can be so confusing. 

00:08:15
GABRIELLE CARLSON Absolutely. 

00:08:15
WINNE KING And if a child with bipolar is misdiagnosed… 

00:08:15
GABRIELLE CARLSON Hmm… 

00:08:20
WINNE KING …and put on the wrong medication that can be a problem, right? 

00:08:20
GABRIELLE CARLSON In the…in the misdiagnosis can go both ways. You call somebody bipolar who isn’t, you prevent him from having medications and treatment he or she should have and the converse is true, if you don’t diagnosed when it’s there, you can withhold the appropriate treatments and the person will stay sicker longer. 

00:08:35
WINNE KING Well, Loretta we just heard Kevin say that he at least had some degree of control… 

00:08:40
LORETTA REARDON Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:40
WINNE KING … on the medication. Have you found that to be true just observing him before medication and after? 

00:08:45
LORETTA REARDON Absolutely umm…before medication, Kevin wouldn’t breakout into rages. Ah…with the medication, within several days, it was actually ah very quick for him and he even told me at the age of eight that he never knew what it was like not to feel angry before and it was and we saw a change of him right away. 

00:09:05
WINNE KING Well how…how could parents make sure that their children are wrongly diagnosed? 

00:09:05
GABRIELLE CARLSON That’s really important and not easy to answer question. But given all the complexes that we just talked about, a good doctor is going to spend time with the parent… 

00:09:15
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:15
GABRIELLE CARLSON Finding out the symptoms of mania and depression and all the other comorbidities; gonna spend time talking to the child and finding out how he feels, gonna get information from teachers, going to get passed evaluations from psychologists or ask for current evaluations because this impacts a child’s performance in school. It takes several hours to make a diagnosis. You may need to see the person several times and it’s sometimes, it’ll take several months or even several years before you can be certain of the diagnosis. 

00:09:45
WINNE KING So this is a very… 

00:09:45
GABRIELLE CARLSON This is not easy. 

00:09:45
WINNE KING …intense process. 

00:09:50
GABRIELLE CARLSON It is. 

00:09:50
WINNE KING Well, a 13-year-old Eva Kemp has also been diagnosed his bipolar, but she really doesn’t have the classic symptoms of mania or euphoria. Let’s take a look at her story. 

00:10:00
EVA KEMP Come on Bail. Bailey? 

00:10:00
BARBARA KEMP Eva’s Mother One of the teachers had asked me umm…did I ever think about ADHD with Eva. She faded, she’s not paying attention, she’s is not able to focus. She was diagnosed with ADHD and she was started on short-acting Ritalin at that point, ah…which we did get reports back from the teacher that you know, it seemed to be working. 

00:10:20
EVA KEMP Good girl, good girl… Got get. 

00:10:25
BARBARA KEMP And then, we started to see the depression and the high anxiety. She would cry very easily umm…you couldn’t look at her wrong and, and she would cry, so then we had to add the anti-depressants. 

00:10:35
EVA KEMP I think it’s when I was 7 umm… well when I was 7, when I started thinking about wanting to not be around. 

00:10:45
BARBARA KEMP Up in the morning, outside, argument with her sister, slamming doors, banging doors, crying, screaming, 10 minutes later back outside, having fun. We saw a lot of destruction in her bedroom. It’s just through the course of the day, they got exhausting. 

00:11:00
EVA KEMP I would stomp, slam doors, yell, scream. 

00:11:05
BARBARA KEMP And one of these crying jag, she got just before she was hospitalized, she got so bad that she just actually lied in my arms, not speaking, not able to speak, I don’t know how many times, you know I, my husband and I would look at each other like what we would do, do we take her to the hospital? Where do you go? 

00:11:20
WINNE KING School was difficult for Eva. 

00:11:25
EVA KEMP They would make fun of me, “Eva why you’re take medication, Oh I don’t like because you’re stupid.” One day after school, I had enough, I didn’t want, I just didn’t want to be around anymore and I knew that I needed to find a way. I was thinking if I jumped out of the tree without the trampoline what it would be like, but I really didn’t want to hurt myself. So, I put the trampoline there just for protection. So, I can’t get to the tree and...and went down. 

00:12:00
BARBARA KEMP She didn’t want to…wanna live. She asked me to put her sleep and she was eventually hospitalized at that time because it got so bad. You feel like you’re not a good parent, because your kid hurt so much and you feel like you know there’s got to be something I can do and why didn’t I see it sooner, why it did get so bad? 

00:12:15
WINNE KING Eva was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

00:12:20
BARBARA KEMP Takes…takes a long time to realize that you can’t control their thoughts and you…you just have to love him and work with him, but umm... that that whole process was extremely…extremely scary. It’s horrifying umm…just to see your child hurt that bad, so we…we started to look into the mood stabilizing drugs and it seems to be working well, the mood swings are there, but they’re not anywhere near what they were. 

00:12:45
EVA KEMP I don’t mean that I’ve been (inaudible ) meaning hit you. I just…I get frustrated. 

00:12:50
BARBARA KEMP Are you frustrated at her or something else? You never know from one minute to the next what’s gonna happen. You…you just you’ve to take it, you know not even one day at a he time, it’s hour by hour umm….it’s vey difficult…to…to try and keep peace. I can put a strain everywhere, puts a strain between mother and father umm…you know husbandand wife….out…outside relatives, you know they don’t… and friends, they don’t understand what you’re going through. 

00:13:20
WINNE KING Family therapy helps the Kemps work through their problems. 

00:13:25
BARBARA KEMP Do you get mad when…when…she gets all the attention? 

00:13:30
EVA KEMP No. Because I know she has got problem, I know she need attention. 

00:13:35
BARBARA KEMP And you know mummy and daddy are trying to help her, right? 

00:13:35
EVA KEMP Yeah. 

00:13:35
 And you know mom and dad are there for you too, right? 

00:13:40
EVA KEMP Yeah. 

00:13:40
WINNE KING Well, Eva and Barbara are here with us now. And you know Eva, it was really amazing we hear you talk about wanting to hurt yourself. Do you still have thoughts of suicide? 

00:13:50
EVA KEMP Umm…I do when I got frustrated, upset, angry, and I’m that way further a while umm…, but I don’t put a lot of thought into them as I did than. 

00:14:05
WINNE KING It’s not on your mind as much as… 

00:14:05
EVA KEMP No. 

00:14:05
WINNE KING ...it used be? You know Gay Eva’s story, you know this is a…a situation where she could have easily you know sort of have been misdiagnosis. How could other doctors have diagnosed her symptoms? 

00:14:15
GABRIELLE CARLSON One of the things that people are trying to come terms with…with bipolar is it’s… it’s a part of a spectrum. Remember, I told you about the depression, a fact that it’s started out being at people, but some people have depressions that’s all I ever have. The more manic symptoms that come into it, the more you fit into the bipolar spectrum. Some people are very conservative and say unless you have a full blown manic episode, you’re not bipolar. Other people say well, if you have just a little bit of giddiness or silliness that means you’re on the bipolar… 

00:14:50
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:50
GABRIELLE CARLSON …spectrum. So, I think that’s part of the confusion in that course, the difficulty is this what are the implications because if you’re very, very depressed, then you may need something to help that depression, but if that something is gonna flip you into a bipolar episode… 

00:15:00
WINNE KING Right. 

00:15:00
GABRIELLE CARLSON ...that’s where the difficulty comes with the implications of the diagnosis. 

00:15:05
WINNE KING Yeah. Well, Barb you know, we…we all heard you know about the…you know the emotional swings that Eva has being going through. What type of parenting tools did you use just sort of deal with that? 

00:15:15
BARBARA KEMP We work… we work closely with our therapist ah…on a regular basis and she gives us some choice. One of the things that we do with Eva is to get her to try and refocus. If they’re in a manic state, the kids have a hard time ah…focusing on what’s it hand. So breathing works withEva… 

00:15:35
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:35
BARBARA KEMP Um, if we can get her to look in our eyes and work with us to slow breath, it tends to help us to be able to work with her because it changes her thought process. 

00:15:45
WINNE KING Yeah, it kind of shifts her in a different direction. 

00:15:45
BARBARA KEMP Yes. 

00:15:45
WINNE KING What about you Loretta? 

00:15:45
LORETTA REARDON Umm… I find sometimes a natural instinct of a parent when a child is going through that is try to overly help them and you try to work with them and sometimes that too much attention, too much speaking to them during that time can actually hinder umm…getting them through it and what I find really is giving him more space. 

00:16:05
WINNE KING Hmm… 

00:16:05
LORETTA REARDON I’m actually letting him work through himself, I’m not being around him, when it be alone and let him calm himself down, it tends to work best. 

00:16:10
WINNE KING Yeah. Well Dr. Jill Goldberg Arnold is a psychologist who works with bipolar kids and is the author of “Raising a Moody Child” and boy what a great title for a book, right. Umm…what…what should parents be considering when they’re trying to discipline a child with this bipolar? 

00:16:25
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD Ph.D. Psychologist I’d like to talk about can’t behavior versus won’t behavior. So, can’t behavior is when a child can’t meet the expectations you’re asking them to meet. Like when a child’s energy level sky rockets later in the day, maybe they can’t sit still for dinner or they can’t serve them by that time. Won’t behavior is when the child can meet expectations, but refuses to. Like when a perfectly calm child is watching TV, you ask him to turn it off and they go into ragging. 

00:16:50
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:55
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD Once parents can separate out can’t from won’t, then they can make a game plan for dealing with each and that’s what the treatment even becomes really important in helping to make that plan. 

00:17:00
WINNE KING Yeah. Well, speaking of treatment, Gay as a medical doctor, what…what can you offer these kids? 

00:17:05
GABRIELLE CARLSON There are four things that I think you can…you should expect from it…at least a child psychiatrist, a good diagnosis. Once you make the diagnosis informing the parent and the child what the problems are, what they can expect in the future, good medication treatment. 

00:17:25
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:25
GABRIELLE CARLSON Umm… and coordinating the interdisciplinary team that’s really necessary to manage all the faces of this condition, which include the therapy aspect, not…not just doing, not necessarily doing, but knowing who to call… 

00:17:35
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:35
GABRIELLE CARLSON Getting the school involved, because the school is often ah… a necessary component of it. Umm…you…a good child psychiatrist needs to orchestrate all those parts. 

00:17:45
WINNE KING And I think also may be…be good and giving education to the family. 

00:17:50
GABRIELLE CARLSON That’s…that’s the educational piece of… 

00:17:50
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:50
GABRIELLE CARLSON …understanding what the condition is and what you can expect from it, which is also something that…that…Jill does with her… 

00:18:00
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:18:00
GABRIELLE CARLSON …therapy. 

00:18:00
WINNE KING Well, let’s talk about the Jill… 

00:18:00
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:00
WINNE KING What is a psychologist can you offer a bipolar child? 

00:18:05
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD Depending on where the family is. 

00:18:05
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:05
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD, Ph.D. Author, Raising a Moody Child So if a family comes to me and they are new to the diagnosis. The first thing I’m gonna do is get them educated. 

00:18:10
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:18:10
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD Because the more child and the family understand about, the illness and symptoms, and how to treat it, the better they’re able they are to see symptoms as problems that they can solve. 

00:18:20
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:20
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD For example, if they’re having a lot of trouble to sleep, which causes a immense family stress. 

00:18:25
WINNE KING Sure. 

00:18:25
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD There we could focus on that. When symptoms are more controlled, then treatment can shift to dealing with related problems like peer problem… 

00:18:30
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:30
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD …which are very common in this population, and then we might work one on one, we might do some coaching with parents, we might work with the school and then do a lot of things. 

00:18:40
WINNE KING Yeah. Well, Barb, Loretta therapy certainly was crucial for you guys, right? 

00:18:45
LORETTA REARDON Absolutely. 

00:18:45
BARBARA KEMP Yes. 

00:18:45
WINNE KING Yeah. Can you…can you expand on what it…what it meant to you? 

00:18:50
BARBARA KEMP Well, I think some…when someone enters with the therapist or someone that they’re gonna work through their feelings, they need to do what is a family unit. Everybody is a part and everybody has their things that they need to work with siblings. The child themselves and the parents as parents and the parents as a couple. 

00:19:05
WINNE KING Hmm...hmm...And Loretta perhaps to having an outside person like it sort of mediate as everybody has got their own emotions about this whole thing can be helpful. 

00:19:15
LORETTA REARDON Absolutely because you try to do what you can as a parent, but you also have certain emotions involved with that and I find that you know we always want to look at what happens on a daily basis. He is maturing, different ah…things happened in his life and different instances that he has to look at how to deal with those as he matures and grows. 

00:19:30
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:19:30
LORETTA REARDON And those are things that does nice to have an outside opinion as well. 

00:19:35
WINNE KING Yeah. Well, you know sometimes simply keeping your bipolar child alive is an accomplishment in itself put you to meet the Ross(ph) family 

00:19:40
 Parker came into the world with an intensity that surprised everybody in the delivery room. He a little really slugged the obstetrician on the way out. I described his tantrums well beyond what normal tantrums were. They were ah... prolonged. They were intense and even as young as three, my biggest fear was Parker killing himself. In third grade, he became suicidal. He started talking about I want to be dead. I would have hold him for hours at a time just to keep him from hurting himself. We had to lock every knife, every…every sharp object we had in the trunk of our car. The way we lived is just indescribable. We had to strip down his room to make it safe. He wrote me notes “I love you mommy, but I want to die.” At this eight, this was eight. 

00:20:35
 There was one time when he tried to jump out of the window… 

00:20:40
WINNE KING Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:40
 …of friend’s house and school when he was that young. 

00:20:45
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:20:45
 And that was a first shock for us. 

00:20:45
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:20:45
 I noticed umm…, he would get giddy and laugh a lot where his friends could stop laughing. He would laugh a lot longer. 

00:20:55
 Extremely hyper. 

00:20:55
 And inappropriately happy and giddy. His neurologist was the first to suggest that he might have pediatric bipolar disorder. 

00:21:05
 Parker was losing touch with reality. 

00:21:10
 He was hearing voices. We could not reach him. 

00:21:10
 Yeah. 

00:21:10
 And he would look at me and say “I’m gonna kill you. I’m going to kill you.” His art work was frightening. At 10th grade, Parker stopped taking his medication and we didn’t… 

00:21:20
 We didn’t know it. We would jump out of our skin every time the phone rang. I remember hearing a phone call once that Parker was arrested and to get home fast or else come home quickly, Parker cut himself. Umm…Come home quickly, Parker tried to jump off the bridge. 

00:21:40
 He did jump off the bridge. 

00:21:40
 Yeah. 

00:21:40
PARKER I guess when you feel a little too good and then you get a little excited, you get hyper and you got to be jumping around everywhere, doing stuff like jumping off bridges and stuff which is fun. I don’t know I guess I was kind of stupid to though. 

00:21:55
 Just see him punch a whole through the wall every time he got upset about something, it was very scary. 

00:22:00
 Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:00
 And I was just worried Lolly would be in danger. What happened was, it commentated(ph) into a nervous breakdown for me. and I remember driving down highway and I thought “God, if I just don’t turn the wheel, ah…my problems over”, you know, and then I of course, I thought about my family and stuff like that. 

00:22:20
PARKER I don’t know if I’m you know really frustrated and like I’m really worked up and I don’t really, I don’t really recognize them, you know upset like this I’ll be be…so focused on like you know, the situation. I you know hit things and throw things around and I kick things whenever it’s out of control. You know you don’t know little of what I know, hit whatever is close by you know yell at people. 

00:22:40
 We had to hospitalize him. This was all in 10th grade. That was the first before hospitalizations. They were very traumatic. Ah…that was first, the four arrests during ah...four months. The school has finally said us, he needs residential placement. So which was the saddest 16 months of our lives. 

00:23:05
 Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:10
PARKER Um, I was doing pretty bad and stuff a while ago and I just…its mainly just like was doing some friends and family, which mean you realize it, I mean I like on my last like, last chance… got to start like change what I’m doing now or get in trouble. 

00:23:25
 Hands up. And when you’re going to bend, your hands up. 

00:23:30
 And now, he has an incredible uh…boxing coach. He is probably the most therapeutic ah…person and activity that he could be doing right now. 

00:23:40
 So, Parker is learning self control. His self-esteem has just sky rocketed… 

00:23:45
PARKER You are controlling your mood sometimes can be hard. Half a way that I can control and a little more than half of it and some of it all…you know some of the medication on like helps me a little bit with it. Basically, it’s your choice like if you want to do something, you know you could definitely do it. If you don’t wanna do it though, you know and no one can really make you do it. 

00:24:05
 It’s been a very, very difficult road. 

00:24:10
WINNE KING Well, what a story. You know, among the many issues that Parker’s story raises is the impact that this has on parents. Jill, what can parents do to take care of themselves? 

00:24:20
JILL GOLDBERG ARNOLD The first and foremost, that means getting social support whether it’s difference in family or if its community agencies, online support, it’s the longhaul, it's marathon, it’s not a sprint. So taking care of themselves is critical and just make sure the sharing parental responsibilities, getting time with their spouse or with their partner, with their friends. And parents can engage in what we called free medicines. Things that are, they don’t have side effects, they don’t have monetary cost, good sleeping habits, good eating habits, good exercise habits. Umm…writing in a journal, accessing their spiritual sides and engaging their sense of humor. 

00:24:50
WINNE KING Ah…you know I would imagine about that this could be really tough as parent you’re… you’re parent, so you’re self focused on the baby, you know the child, you know, you want them to be well and you forget about yourself, did you…did you find yourself doing that sort of slipping into being such an advocate for the child you weren’t taking care of yourself. 

00:25:05
BARBARA KEMP Absolutely, especially in the beginning because you’re trying to work things out. 

00:25:10
WINNE KING Yeah. How about you Loretta? 

00:25:10
LORETTA REARDON Absolutely and you also, you worry about a lot of different aspects, you’re worried about you know siblings, you worried about your job and you worried about your child and sometimes you know, you feel the stress of that, so … 

00:25:20
WINNE KING Yeah. They can be really tough. We just got a few seconds left Gay, but I wanna just ask you briefly about the idea of using medications for bipolar. I mean parents are nervous about the putting their kids on drugs, you know can a child get through this without medication? 

00:25:35
GABRIELLE CARLSON Probably not. Um, and medication is an extremely important component that said, there is no free lunch, medications have side effects, parents need to be informed about the side effects. People misinterpret side effects of medications. They sometimes want to make a diagnosis depending on if the child has a bad response to medication. H.L. Mencken has a wonderful quote “Every complex problem has a simple solution, and it’s often wrong.” 

00:26:05
WINNE KING Yeah. 

00:26:05
GABRIELLE CARLSON So, people who have a glyph solution to bipolar disorder in children, I’ll give them wide birth.
