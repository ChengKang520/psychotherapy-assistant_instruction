07/17/13 

00:00:00
BOB Uh… so now, this is some kind of a uh… my uh… counseling office and umm… do they walk in sor, or, I mean, by that I mean uh… they self refer or are they uh… sent? 

00:00:15
UNKNOWN Which, which side of it? I mean, 'cause we need help. 

00:00:20
BOB So you, you came, you want court refer or uh… children's protective service or something like that? 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN We're trying to save out marriage. Uh… our, our oldest, our youngest kid, she left home. Yeah, and we have problems. I'm just void in her life and uh… you know, we, we have to re-up rise our relationship, you know, because we're starting to drift apart. 

00:00:35
BOB Okay. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN Kids, I wish to get at the normal there. 

00:00:40
BOB Is that right? 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Probably, it's right. 

00:00:45
BOB Okay, so now, what names you wanna go by? 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN "Elroy" 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Bob 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN "Judy" 

00:00:50
JUDY I'll be Judy 

00:00:50
BOB Judy? 

00:00:50
ELROY Elroy. 

00:00:55
BOB Elroy. Okay! Uh… now, let's see what all I know. What you just told me or any more. 

00:01:00
ELROY Yes. 

00:01:05
BOB Okay! So… all right, well, Judy and Elroy, uh… we've been through all the inform concern uh… information that you uh… read about, signed off on and etcetera. So uh… you came here and you said you wanted some kind of counseling. So, uh… I'm just wondering what you would like to have happen here in the next few minutes as we're talking. 

00:01:35
ELROY We'll go with you then. 

00:01:40
JUDY Uh… well, I'm here basically, because you seem to think there's something wrong with our marriage and in particular that I have some sort of trauma happening in my life, 'cause we have no children at home. He's diagnosing very well. Uh… he's been watching too many, you know, self help shows or something. He thinks I have empty nest syndrome 

00:02:00
BOB Empty nest, okay. 

00:02:05
JUDY Yeah! Any of that, some diagnosis that he could build an insurance, but… 

00:02:05
BOB Mm-hmm! Yeah. 

00:02:10
JUDY That's what he thinks. 

00:02:10
ELROY Well, no, no, it's not about reading, well, you told me that I needed the governing, because I have changed. And now that the kids weren't here that you're worrying about, you know, us breaking up and then you, you felt some crepitation about that. 

00:02:25
JUDY Right, because you are blaming me constantly for the deterioration of our marriage, because you think, I got empty nest syndrome. That's what you tell me about us, empty nest syndrome. 

00:02:35
ELROY Oh, it's just something that you pulled around, you know, these self-help groups. I mean, it was the Dr. Phill Shawn(ph)… 

00:02:45
BOB So you're having a little difficulty right now, agreeing instead why you are here? 

00:02:45
ELROY Screen play here. 

00:02:50
BOB Is that be accurate? 

00:02:50
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:02:50
BOB Accurate for you? Okay. So umm… now, do you wanna spend a lot of time discussing, why you're here and what problem is and you wanna get that out, be open or you wanna hide it? Which one? 

00:03:10
ELROY I don't know. 'Cause I, you know, I got things to do, I just soon uh… you know, was always quickly and get on to their lives. 

00:03:15
BOB Okay! 

00:03:20
JUDY Yeah, fine, this practice is good for me. 

00:03:20
BOB Practice good, okay. So, let me ask you this. Umm… just this far as what you want to have happen here? Do you want to solve a specific, clearly identifiable problem or do you want to solve, do you want to work on, it happened, some kind of a pattern of behavior or third, do you want to work on learning some skills that you can use regardless of whether you're in counseling about them? So that's kind of, I know that, that's a lot of think about, but something specific or a pattern or skills that would go beyond what we're talking about here. 

00:04:00
ELROY I'm pretty happy. My life, I mean, she's the one that has the problem. 

00:04:05
BOB Yeah, but try to, try to think about that question. 

00:04:10
ELROY Umm… what is it? You know, I'd come in here for you. 

00:04:15
JUDY I'd like to work on the pattern of behavior… 

00:04:15
BOB Pattern of behavior. 

00:04:15
JUDY …that was just exhibited by him by constantly pointing the finger at me… 

00:04:20
BOB Okay! 

00:04:20
JUDY …as if there's something wrong with me while he is perfectly happy with his life, paying out the joy everyday, begging on the wing, constantly pushing that in my face as if I have not been any kind of contributor to our family of all these years. 

00:04:35
BOB Okay, so, it is, it is… 

00:04:35
JUDY So , that's the pattern. 

00:04:40
BOB …what you're saying is, you wanna work on his pattern of behavior. 

00:04:40
JUDY Yes. 

00:04:40
BOB Okay. 

00:04:45
ELROY Seem, what I was doing… 

00:04:45
BOB So, why you wanna work on… 

00:04:45
ELROY What, what I was doing was fine before, you know, Lesley left… 

00:04:45
BOB Yeah. 

00:04:50
ELROY …and now she's got all these time, she's just nothing… 

00:04:50
BOB So, you might wanna work on her nagging and her pattern of behavior. 

00:04:55
ELROY Her pattern has changed. Well, it is. 

00:04:55
BOB Yeah, with her current pattern… 

00:04:55
ELROY Yes. 

00:05:00
BOB …behavior, is that what you're saying? 

00:05:00
ELROY I liked it before, where she was, she'd get something to do. 

00:05:05
BOB But, now you're, you use the word nag. 

00:05:05
ELROY Well, you heard it. That was nagging. 

00:05:10
BOB Well, I'm just asking. Is that, you wanna work on her behavior, her pattern, her way of dealing with… 

00:05:15
ELROY She isn't working on it. I can't tell her anything. 

00:05:15
BOB All right! You wanna work on his. 

00:05:20
JUDY Yes. 

00:05:20
ELROY She's trying to tell me that… 

00:05:20
BOB Now. 

00:05:20
ELROY I'm trying to tell her what to do. 

00:05:25
BOB Yeah. But, you didn't, well, okay. Umm… Almost looked into what I hear, you two doing which is argument. 

00:05:35
ELROY It's horrible. 

00:05:35
BOB Even I do it. 

00:05:35
ELROY Yeah! 

00:05:35
BOB I almost, I almost did it. I was tempted to argue like this. 

00:05:40
ELROY We never argue. 

00:05:40
BOB Well, what did I do when I was tempted to argue with, you dint even know that I was tempted to argue. I couldn't tell that now. Okay, could you tell? 

00:05:50
JUDY That you were tempted to arguing? 

00:05:50
BOB Yeah! 

00:05:50
JUDY No. 

00:05:55
BOB No. Now, do you think, if a councilor argues with people who come for help, what impact you think that has on the help that they're likely to get? 

00:06:05
ELROY Well, you're trained under it. 

00:06:05
BOB Yeah, I know. But, if I, if I did argue, what, what would happen? 

00:06:10
ELROY Well, you're gonna lose credibility. 

00:06:10
BOB Yeah, what do you say? 

00:06:10
JUDY I agree. 

00:06:15
BOB So you, you agree on him? 

00:06:15
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:06:15
BOB So, you're arguing about that? 

00:06:15
JUDY No, I think you'd… 

00:06:20
BOB Okay, okay. 

00:06:20
ELROY Yeah, we agree on that. 

00:06:20
BOB So, so, but the interesting thing and I didn't really think about this is that I felt the urge, argue. And I didn't and you're saying, I'm just trying to understand. If a third person doesn't argue, they have more credibility, they have more ability to, to connect with you both. Would that be true? 

00:06:50
ELROY Yeah! 

00:06:50
BOB So, let me ask you this. I know. Suppose you went to a store and you're gonna buy a fairly umm… substantial and you're going to make a fairly substantial investments like, like say, like, television set, you're going to buy it and the uh… sales person argues with you, you know, really, it's just kind of aggravating, what would happen as far as you really missed to buy that product? 

00:07:25
JUDY Oh, I had that happened one time, I walked out. 

00:07:25
BOB That day you walked out. 

00:07:25
ELROY I'll be less willing again. 

00:07:25
BOB You'll be less willing. So, let me ask you this. This is a long buildup to this question. If you do to demonstrate at home and in your life outside of this conversation, a kind of argumentative way to deal with each other, is that likely to bring pleasure in your life or pain? 

00:07:55
ELROY Well, what it does to me is, it brings me neither, it just closes me of. I just, I just want to get away. 

00:08:00
BOB Okay, when he closes of, does that bring you pleasure or pain? 

00:08:05
JUDY Yep! That brings me pleasure. 

00:08:05
BOB Oh, you're lying. 

00:08:10
JUDY I, I, I, when he, when he just closes off and he gets out of the room and leaves me alone and puts nagging at me. That feels much better. But, when he's in the room and he's constantly around my back… 

00:08:20
BOB Oh… 

00:08:20
ELROY That describes exactly how I feel. 

00:08:20
BOB So… 

00:08:25
ELROY You know, you start nagging me and you go away. 

00:08:25
JUDY Yeah! 

00:08:25
ELROY Then I have these… 

00:08:25
BOB Yeah. 

00:08:25
JUDY That's when the empty nest feels good. 

00:08:30
BOB Umm… okay. Well, maybe, may, maybe you two could make a pact not to talk to each other. Would that be the kind of pattern? Would that be the life you want? 

00:08:45
ELROY Oh, you, you know, we dint talk much when the kids are here and she was busy. 

00:08:50
BOB Yeah. Now on, is that a life you, where you'll not talk to each other? 

00:08:55
ELROY I'd like to have a good stimulating relationship with the women I live with.. 

00:09:00
BOB So, he's very willing to talk about that you can talk with him. He's not shutting down now. 

00:09:05
JUDY Now you're being argumentative towards me, because I feel like… 

00:09:05
BOB No. 

00:09:05
JUDY …you're saying that there's something wrong with me. You know… 

00:09:10
BOB No, I'm just trying, kind of filter what he said through my way of thinking. 

00:09:15
JUDY She's nagging really. 

00:09:15
BOB To you, you want, Judy, I pay uh… a life where you knock up through each other. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
JUDY No. 

00:09:30
BOB Well, you're little hesitative. 

00:09:35
JUDY Yeah, I think I've kind of worked out on our life. 

00:09:35
BOB oh, yeah? 

00:09:40
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:09:40
ELROY You're right. Here in door. 

00:09:40
BOB Now, let me ask you this. Let me ask you, how about our learning? I mean, you're burned out, be like a dead in there that's not capable of reuniting or would it be something you could, you think you could reunite? 

00:10:00
JUDY You know, I've seen umm… we used to have fires out in the backyard in a, in a fire pit and I've seen fires reuniting after few days… 

00:10:10
BOB Yeah. 

00:10:10
JUDY …something there. 

00:10:10
BOB Uh… 

00:10:15
JUDY But, it takes an often lot to reunite it. 

00:10:15
BOB Yes, it does. 

00:10:15
JUDY And it takes and often lot of energy and lot of patience, I'm afraid, my own, kind of tied it up right now. 

00:10:25
ELROY …some hard ways. May be, you know, I could lift, risk my life and start over. That might be fresh and interesting and you could do the same as I do. It's right, we just don't have anything left, neither kids we have one. 

00:10:30
BOB I though you could work on uh… pattern of behavior. You know, may be, it maybe is, maybe you've changed, maybe you had some specific behavior like, what lawyers are called. 

00:10:45
ELROY We have now, we wouldn't want to have a long(ph) divorce. We wanna agree, you know, 'cause we've seen our friends that had their divorces now. 

00:10:50
BOB Yeah, you could have a uh… very friendly divorce. You would be the first couple in history to have such a… 

00:11:00
ELROY Yes, 'cause the lawyers, they, they get at each others throat. They got mixed forms you can buy. You're in Kentucky and just do yourself and go down the court house. 

00:11:10
BOB I don't, dint meet them. 

00:11:10
ELROY Rather they're. We just agreed. I'm rather happy to give you half of every thing and you go your way and I'll go mine. We deserve what we got and we will get back here later on, down the road, but there's nothing left to you right now. You know, here I wanted to do anything and I'm not, you're burning down. The kids are gone. 

00:11:30
BOB He's certainty saying what he, you know, you just talked 'em a lot as… 

00:11:30
JUDY He always does. 

00:11:35
BOB So umm… what you wanna do? You wanna divorce or you wanna stay married? You want me to be, help you with the divorce? You want me to help you at least save marriage for a while? 

00:11:45
ELROY She ain't got my words. I mean, I'm fulfilled… 

00:11:45
BOB Try to answer that question Elroy. 

00:11:50
ELROY Hence, after her. I'm comfortable… …kids together. 

00:11:50
BOB Try to answer that question. 

00:11:55
ELROY Prose it again. 

00:11:55
BOB Do you want me to be a divorce councilor or a marriage councilor? 

00:12:00
ELROY I can go either way of that. What do you want to do? 

00:12:05
BOB Either way, if you went one way, which way would it be? 

00:12:05
ELROY Either way. I'm, I'm just , I can make a word. I'm a resilient, I can survive no matter what happens. She is the one that has a problem. 

00:12:10
BOB Judy, how about you? You want me to be a marriage councilor or divorce councilor? 

00:12:15
JUDY I'd like you to be a mediator councilor. 

00:12:15
BOB A mediator, oh… 

00:12:20
JUDY Yes, I, I, I, I think that's what I feel I want right now. I don't wanna give up on the relationship because of Lesley… 

00:12:25
BOB Okay. 

00:12:25
JUDY …our daughter. You know what I mean, she just left and I think this will pretty devastating for her. She's in college now. I think our divorce wouldn't be very helpful to her. I'm sure it's been hard enough to watch, for her to watch everything and I want her to do well in school and be happy. So, I guess for me, I don't, I don't know what the long term situation 's gonna be about the marriage, but I would mind mediating some, some sort of mutual ground where we can be more civil to each other and quit the finger pointing and the name calling and all that kind of stuff, 'cause I, I'm feeling it is hardened and crushed and burned out every single day. 

00:13:10
BOB Now… 

00:13:10
ELROY That's because she can't do anything. 

00:13:10
BOB …no, no. Don't say anything. Let me ask you this. you know what, when you heard her say, what she just said, I wished we could've gotten on, what do you think? Because I ask you to listen to it every day, but I like you to just tell what you heard, her, not what she said, but the kind of underlying tone of what she said. What that you hear about? 

00:13:40
ELROY It seems like she's living a life… 

00:13:45
BOB What did you hear? No, no, no… 

00:13:45
ELROY Quite, less provisions. 

00:13:50
BOB Oh! 

00:13:50
ELROY Quiet, less provisions. 

00:13:50
BOB Okay, that's it. That's it. What I… so you felt, that's what you heard. 

00:13:55
ELROY Yeah! 

00:13:55
BOB All right! Now, Judy, is that something that you believe that you expressed? 

00:14:05
JUDY No, I don't. Because, that terms were, when he said that, that pretty much help for yourself…. 

00:14:10
BOB Okay, when he said what he said, did you get any, anything, uh… kind of underlying that expression, not just the, not just the words, but is there anything coming from the heart? 

00:14:25
JUDY From him? 

00:14:25
BOB Mm-hmm! 

00:14:25
JUDY Uh… that truthfully is the kind of like, it chocks me all the time like, you're something lacking and all desperate and… 

00:14:30
BOB Yeah! Yeah! 

00:14:30
JUDY …and that were they and all those things and again, you know, because there's something missing in my life that he's been so lucky, because he has his work and, and everything is perfect for him. 

00:14:45
BOB Yeah, okay. Now, let me ask if this… 

00:14:50
ELROY She, she had to spend the… 

00:14:50
BOB Hold on, hold on. What would you like from him on an emotional gut love? Not intellectual stuff of here, but down here. What would you like… 

00:15:05
JUDY What does my gut say I want from him? 

00:15:05
BOB Yes, yes. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:15
JUDY I don't, you know what, I want him to behave like a friend. 

00:15:25
BOB Okay! Now, do you hear that? 

00:15:25
ELROY I'm her best friend. 

00:15:25
BOB Did you hear that? 

00:15:25
ELROY Yeah, I heard it. 

00:15:25
BOB So, all I'm gonna ask and I want you to answer, I wanna hear is that, whether or not you heard? 

00:15:30
ELROY I heard it. 

00:15:35
BOB Okay. Now, what will be a quality that a friend would demonstrate as a kind of a… on a habitual basis? 

00:15:45
JUDY Mm-hmm! You know what, a friend doesn't try and change. 

00:15:50
BOB So, what, what's the positive? 

00:15:50
JUDY The friend acceptional. 

00:15:50
BOB Acceptional and would they accept you and then grows like you? 

00:15:55
JUDY No! 

00:15:55
BOB Okay. 

00:16:00
ELROY I do accept her. 

00:16:00
BOB Did you hear that? you have to do that. 

00:16:00
ELROY I need to hold a mirror… 

00:16:00
BOB It isn't, it doesn't, it, it, it is not as important. What you're, what you believe. I'm just asking you, if you can understand what she believes? 

00:16:10
ELROY I understand exactly what she's saying, because that's how I feel. 

00:16:15
BOB Okay, okay. Well, that's what she wants from you now. Do you feel like you're getting it? 

00:16:15
JUDY No! 

00:16:20
BOB So, now let me ask you this. What do you want from Judy, in other way, on a gut, gut love? 

00:16:30
ELROY I want her to be happy. 

00:16:30
BOB No. What do you want for yourself? 

00:16:35
ELROY I want to be happy. 

00:16:35
BOB You wanna be happy. 

00:16:35
ELROY Yeah. 

00:16:35
BOB Okay. And what do you want from her that would help you to be happy? 

00:16:40
ELROY If she was happy… 

00:16:40
BOB On a gut love. 

00:16:40
ELROY …that would make me happy. Within, within reason, I mean, she kind of just taught me. 

00:16:50
BOB Okay, can you say that again with elder qualification? 

00:16:55
ELROY If she was happy, I would be happy. 

00:16:55
BOB Do you want her to be happy? 

00:17:00
ELROY Of course, I want everybody to be happy. 

00:17:00
BOB Okay, now, what could you give her that will help her to be happy? My gut love or… 

00:17:05
ELROY Ask her that. 

00:17:10
BOB No, no. I'm asking you. 

00:17:10
ELROY I don't know. 

00:17:15
BOB Whether you'd live with it. I think she said it. 

00:17:20
ELROY She said what? What she said? You know, she said a lot of things to me… 

00:17:25
BOB What did she say, what did she say that she'd like… 

00:17:25
ELROY She doesn't want me to nag her, but I don't know, because she nags me. 

00:17:35
BOB No, it wasn't nagging. Okay. 

00:17:35
ELROY Prose it again. 

00:17:35
BOB Wanna tell him again? 

00:17:40
JUDY I said, I want, I want to be accepted of who I am. 

00:17:45
ELROY I totally accept her, I do accept her from she is. 

00:17:50
BOB Do you agree with that? 

00:17:50
JUDY No! 

00:17:50
ELROY That's not an issue. 

00:17:50
BOB Say that again. 

00:17:50
ELROY I do accept the way you are. 

00:17:55
JUDY No, you don't. 

00:17:55
ELROY Yes, I do. So, ain't you calling me a lire? You're seeing what happens here? I tell her, I'm telling, I'm accepting her and I started to feel and she doesn't worry about it. 

00:18:00
JUDY I'm trying to be affirm with you and to tell you that in spite of what ever efforts you think you're making, to me, it's coming up for us that I'm not good enough to whether I am, that I got to change, that there's some problem I have and that's the message that I get from you every single day. 

00:18:20
ELROY Well, what are you… 

00:18:20
BOB Okay, okay. Now, you said that. You said that. I'm asking you both now, are you willing to take on board what the other person said? Because, what you said, Judy is that you want acceptance from him and what, what Elroy said was, "I already do accept her." Are you willing to give that some consideration? 

00:18:40
JUDY That he accepts me? 

00:18:40
BOB That he does accept you. And may be he accepts you the way he, the way he does. I mean, it's that, they're not the way you would like it. 

00:18:55
JUDY Well… 

00:18:55
BOB Are you willing to get some consideration to that? 

00:19:00
JUDY I, I agree that he accepts me the way he thinks he accepts me. 

00:19:05
BOB Yeah! 

00:19:05
JUDY Yeah. And that's… 

00:19:05
ELROY How it must be? I accept you. 

00:19:05
BOB All right! Okay. 

00:19:05
ELROY Except for that. 

00:19:10
JUDY Yeah, that's an outdated acceptance. 

00:19:10
BOB Well, then that might be something that I asked you of something. 

00:19:15
ELROY What, what is it that I can do that will shoe you that I accept you? 

00:19:20
JUDY Quit nagging me to be something different than what I am. 

00:19:20
BOB Okay, all right! Now, did you hear that? 

00:19:25
ELROY Yeah. 

00:19:25
BOB All right! Now, what would you want from her along those lines? 

00:19:30
ELROY To change that idea, because it's not true. 

00:19:35
BOB no, no. what else. That would be the first thing. 

00:19:40
ELROY You know, you know what the problem is? She doesn't have anything to do. That's the feeling she got. 

00:19:45
BOB All right! I'll talk with, I mean… 

00:19:45
ELROY You just asked me, what I want her to do… 

00:19:45
BOB No, no, what you wanted from her on a gut love? 

00:19:50
ELROY I want her to believe in then what I tell her is true. 

00:19:55
BOB Okay. Oh, so you want her to… 

00:19:55
ELROY I'm not lying her. 

00:19:55
BOB …believe her. 

00:20:00
ELROY Yeah! 

00:20:00
BOB She, you want her to believe. 

00:20:00
ELROY She is a female, I'm a male. We're different perceptions of what we're learning. 

00:20:05
BOB Did you hear what he said? He want's you to believe. 

00:20:05
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:20:05
ELROY Look at that face. You see that? She doubts me. 

00:20:10
JUDY Oh, God. Yeah. 

00:20:10
BOB but, you know one thing, one thing, he does see you. He can really read your, your non-verbals. 

00:20:15
ELROY Yeah, see. 

00:20:15
JUDY Yeah, well, I have other non verbals. You can't see them. 

00:20:20
BOB Oh, well. Oh, well. 

00:20:20
JUDY My arm is tucked right in my sleeves. 

00:20:25
BOB well, I can tell that. 

00:20:25
ELROY I wanna see your hands. 

00:20:30
JUDY That's' why I have my arms tucked in my sleeves. 

00:20:30
BOB Yeah! 

00:20:30
ELROY What is it… 

00:20:30
BOB What would you like to do with those hands. 

00:20:35
JUDY I don't think I wanna say that, because you… 

00:20:35
BOB You can say. 

00:20:40
JUDY …well, you said, you just like, you had a signed agreement when we came here about what you had to report and stuff. 

00:20:45
BOB yeah, yeah. I have owed and like to do. Not what you will to do. 

00:20:45
ELROY She got distracted. 

00:20:50
BOB Like to slap the shit out of him. 

00:20:55
JUDY Mm-hmm! Well, yeah, but that's not what I want to be today. 

00:20:55
BOB no! 

00:20:55
JUDY But, I, I wouldn't mind doing that sometimes. 

00:21:00
BOB Sure! Sure! 

00:21:00
ELROY If I, if I let you do that to me, would you feel better? Just slap the shit out of, how you want, you wanna get it out… 

00:21:05
JUDY No, no, because you know, wife doesn't want to change you. That doesn't mean I don't get you to do it sometimes. 

00:21:10
BOB Okay, so, so… 

00:21:15
ELROY Neither we're willing at a change… 

00:21:15
BOB Let me ask you this. Slapping is not, are you telling me both, both of you that slapping would not help this relationship. I mean, that's the impression I got… 

00:21:25
JUDY right, that's why I don't do it. 

00:21:25
BOB You agree with that? 

00:21:25
ELROY Yes I do agree… 

00:21:30
BOB Okay, so, how about verbal slapping? Is that gonna help through your relationship? 

00:21:35
ELROY But, actually, is, is, it is painful… 

00:21:35
BOB Does that, okay. So that's painful for you? 

00:21:35
ELROY Yeah! 

00:21:35
BOB It hurts? 

00:21:40
ELROY Yeah! Absolutely! 

00:21:40
BOB Where does it hurt in your body? 

00:21:40
ELROY My heart, right here. 

00:21:40
BOB Oh, uh… that's serious. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
BOB So, verbal slapping, what does that do for you? 

00:21:55
JUDY It also hurts, that you feel it out as talking about it. 

00:21:55
BOB Sure, all right, all right. Now, now, the question is for both of you. Do you wanna make that hurt worse or do you wanna make it better? One minute, don't too quick to answer. Just think about that. 

00:22:20
ELROY You're asking me to gain by wasting time. I know exactly. I can answer any question. 

00:22:25
BOB You wanna make it worse… 

00:22:25
ELROY I know where I'm, I'm at. 

00:22:25
BOB …you wanna make it worse or do you wanna make it better? 

00:22:30
ELROY I want to paint is all away. I want us just to have a happy, harmonious relationship. 

00:22:35
BOB So, are you saying, you wanna make it better? 

00:22:35
ELROY She's need either. 

00:22:35
BOB Or you wanna make, do you wanna make it better all way. 

00:22:35
ELROY Yes. 

00:22:35
JUDY Yes. 

00:22:35
BOB All right! You wanna make that hurt less and you wanna make it, make your self feel better. Now, I'm going to make a, a uh… a recommendation. Would you be willing to, to follow through on the recommends, fairer, easiest, not hard to do. 

00:22:55
ELROY What do you say? 

00:23:00
BOB No! I'm not gonna tell you until you agree either to do it or not to do it. 

00:23:00
ELROY Something like, price line… 

00:23:05
BOB Yes, it is, experiment price line. Because, this is, this relates not to or tell about your life. 

00:23:10
ELROY I'll, I'll agree if she agrees. 

00:23:15
BOB Yeah. Whether you agree or not agree independently of what the other person agrees. 

00:23:20
ELROY Sure, I agree. 

00:23:20
BOB Will you agree? 

00:23:25
JUDY Yes! 

00:23:25
BOB Okay. And it's very simple. I would like you to ask you each of your, to yourself personally, before I say this, I'm going to hold back and not say every thing I feel like saying, especially if that other person sees it as a verbal slap. Whether it's honest or dishonest or what ever it is, whether it's being open or closed, the question is, will the other person see it as a slap? Am I high intended? But, how the other person will see it… 

00:24:10
ELROY This requires in a, the vigilance. 

00:24:15
BOB Yeah! 

00:24:15
ELROY Well, this is a tough one. 

00:24:15
BOB Well, I think you're capable of it, both in here. You think you're capable enough? 

00:24:20
JUDY Yeah, I must say, just don't say anything… 

00:24:25
BOB Well! 

00:24:25
JUDY …by anyway. 

00:24:25
ELROY She just feels… 

00:24:25
BOB Okay, now, when you just said that, did you, did you, think about what I just said? You put it on hold. 

00:24:35
ELROY When does it start, right now? 

00:24:40
BOB Yeah, but you said, you were doing. 

00:24:40
ELROY Ready to do it. 

00:24:40
BOB You already said you would do it. 

00:24:45
ELROY Yes, this, this is the starting problem, are you starting then? 

00:24:50
BOB well, I asked you before, are you willing to do this? 

00:24:50
ELROY When, suicide ring? 

00:24:50
BOB Well, you're here and uh… I don't mean next week. I'm talking about at this moment. 

00:24:50
ELROY And what, what if I can do it and she can't do it? How would I react to that? Do I, do I hold it back again and again and again, if she just keeps going on? That's what we're doing. You think like school children? 

00:25:00
BOB What do you think? 

00:25:05
ELROY I wouldn't have tried anything. 

00:25:05
BOB All right! Normally he wouldn’t try anything. 

00:25:10
JUDY Sure. 

00:25:15
BOB And you want me to try it now? 

00:25:15
JUDY Yeah! 

00:25:15
BOB Now, what I suggested is, to hold back before you say anything. I noticed, I didn't say, don't say anything. I said, before you say something. So, are you willing to do that? 

00:25:35
ELROY Yes! 

00:25:35
BOB Now. 

00:25:35
JUDY Yes! 

00:25:35
BOB Okay, now, and we'll write it down. And I, I'll need you to call my office every other day between now and the time we meet again and give me a 10 second report. 

00:25:50
ELROY Yeah, pick it up. 

00:25:55
BOB Each of you, each of you. 

00:25:55
JUDY Have you got the list for that? 

00:25:55
BOB No, no. 

00:26:00
ELROY Don't worry. I'll pay for it. 

00:26:05
JUDY Did you think it for yourself then? 

00:26:10
BOB Oh… good question. 

00:26:10
ELROY Here I was paying my… 

00:26:10
BOB Did you hear that question? 

00:26:15
ELROY Did you think before you said that? 

00:26:15
BOB Did you hear that question? 

00:26:15
ELROY Yeah, I've heard it. 

00:26:15
BOB Okay. 

00:26:20
ELROY So rather we, she should offence to that. I was being like, manner less. 

00:26:20
BOB Yeah! 

00:26:20
ELROY So, it sounds like, so there's nothing I can say. 

00:26:25
BOB It isn't your intention, it's how the other person says it. Are you willing to think about that? It isn't your intention. It's how the other person says that. Sees, sees it. 

00:26:35
JUDY I'm sorry. Say that again, because I'm so pissed off right now. I could not hear you. 

00:26:40
BOB Okay, it isn't how the other person intends it. It's how the other person sees it. 

00:26:50
JUDY Okay! So, it really is gonna be tricky, because you never know how somebody's gonna take what you got. 

00:26:55
BOB Exactly! 

00:27:00
JUDY And it doesn't work, I'll, like me right now. I'm so pissed off right now… 

00:27:00
BOB All right then, who are you pissed of at? 

00:27:05
JUDY At him. That's really hard to have anything come through… 

00:27:10
BOB Yeah! 

00:27:10
JUDY …without a feeling like far more depth. 

00:27:15
BOB Yeah! 

00:27:15
ELROY Sweetie… 

00:27:15
BOB Don't say anything. Did you hear what she said? 

00:27:20
ELROY Yeah! 

00:27:20
BOB Okay, so… 

00:27:20
ELROY You're right. Thing to do is not say anything. Because there… 

00:27:25
BOB Will you? Will you? All right, that would be a good resolution, uh… resolution, but you'll never keep it. 

00:27:35
ELROY Well, I, I would keep it. But, you know what happens? She'll be knocking on my door with some kind of spot, because she gets, she gets upset of… 

00:27:40
BOB Now, are we going backwards or are we going forward right here? 

00:27:45
ELROY Okay, what ever you like to do, you're the boss. 

00:27:45
BOB Well, I'm suggesting you to do for me. what if you say everything that's on your mind, either of you without what I suggested. What impact is that going to have? 

00:28:00
ELROY And what if we slip, get it, get it, be like it, like the sake of words, we apologize. 

00:28:05
BOB What impact is that going to have on your relationship? That's the question and what impact is that going to have on the causing pain or pleasure, or at least not causing pain in the other person? This is not going to be easy. It's not going to be easy for you Judy, because of what you just said before. You said, you're pissed off and I think, under that is hurt. Am I right or wrong? 

00:28:35
JUDY That's true. 

00:28:35
BOB Okay! It's not gonna be easy for you Elroy, because you're, you'd like to say what's on your mind. I'm saying, I'm saying, hold back and if you can't do it, and if you can't do it, go to the lawyer room. 

00:28:50
ELROY Oh, the lawyer. 

00:28:50
BOB See the lawyer. 

00:28:50
ELROY So, this is the only strategy. It is, if we do this one exercise and doesn't work, we go to the lawyer. I mean, you got to stop the mouths? I mean… 

00:29:05
BOB Is this you are trained to do? 

00:29:05
ELROY no, it's just like a war. 

00:29:05
BOB Is it too hard? 

00:29:10
ELROY It's like a war. 

00:29:10
BOB Well, then don't do it. 

00:29:10
ELROY It doesn't solve, it doesn't solve the problem. 

00:29:10
BOB Go to the lawyer. 

00:29:15
ELROY The problem is, she needs to find something to do, gives her meaning that fulfills her life. 

00:29:20
BOB Okay! 

00:29:20
ELROY I've got that. I got my work, that's' gives her a lot, she is willing to do and she's, she's gonna wait there out for me to say something so she can misinterpret it and then climb up. Don't you think, her phone's gonna be ringing off, he said that, he said that, he said that. 

00:29:30
BOB Now, you went through that horizon and what in fact do you think that here is on your wife? 

00:29:40
ELROY I probably dint see, because that's raising the problem. 

00:29:45
BOB Yeah, you're right. You're good at that. 

00:29:45
ELROY I am. 

00:29:45
BOB In fact, it kind of pissed me off and I'm not even married to you. 

00:29:50
JUDY Are you married? 

00:29:55
BOB Not with him. 

00:29:55
ELROY Do you have any kids? 

00:30:00
BOB Well, we're not here for me. No, I've always hear and I'm thinking that it's essential. 

00:30:05
ELROY What if you had it? 

00:30:05
BOB Just bare what I said. 

00:30:10
ELROY You just don't say anything. You just make it into the other brain. 

00:30:10
BOB Yeah, asking me my self is just gonna help or hurt. This is gonna cause pain, this is gonna cause pleasure. What you impact will live here. 

00:30:20
ELROY So, basically, you have that cover it on yourself before you say anything, you run through those three folders… 

00:30:25
BOB Yeah! Yeah! 

00:30:25
ELROY There's a computer sign you say if it doesn't stop. 

00:30:30
BOB Like, Elroy, you're right on top. 

00:30:30
ELROY Wow! 

00:30:35
BOB Did you hear him, what he said? 

00:30:35
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:30:35
BOB Did you like what he said? 

00:30:35
JUDY Conception, yeah. 

00:30:40
BOB Okay! Well, that's what we're talking about. Now we went from the gut to the, would you tell him, "I like what you said." Could you just look him in the eye and tell him that? And you be quiet. 

00:30:50
JUDY I like what you said. 

00:30:55
BOB Could you say it again, with a little, kind of bring it down from your conceptual world and there it go, it's impossible. And so, you just breath, you breath, right there and it went down, one more deep breath. 

00:31:15
JUDY I like what you said. 

00:31:20
BOB Don't say anything. Now, can you say, "Thank you." 

00:31:25
ELROY Thank you. 

00:31:25
BOB Can you say it little more warm, with a little more warmth? 

00:31:30
ELROY Thank you, I really believe that you, you meant that. 

00:31:35
BOB Oh, did you notice anything in this tone of voice there. 

00:31:35
JUDY He sounded sincere. 

00:31:40
BOB Mm-hmm! She just said that, how did that feel to you? 

00:31:45
ELROY Well, I have tears. 

00:31:45
JUDY Me too. 

00:31:50
BOB Okay! Now, which is better? The 15 seconds of the 10 seconds that you just you, uh… 10seconds that you've experienced the different kind of communication. Which one is better? That 10 seconds or the 50 minutes of tough talk, not completely tough talk, but some tough talk uh… that you, you used until that moment, which is better? 

00:32:15
ELROY I feel, I feel the anger re united. 

00:32:20
BOB Mm-hmm! 

00:32:25
JUDY I can see the anger. 

00:32:30
BOB Okay, okay. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
BOB Now, would you be willing to call me when you leave here, wait, wait, wait, we keep a lot of cleanliness, it's our office. You want some clean, you look like, you're… 

00:32:55
ELROY Thank you Sweetie. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I think Bob needs the most. 

00:33:00
BOB Okay, now, uh… so, would you be willing to call me with in an hour after you leave here? 

00:33:15
ELROY While in the car? 

00:33:15
BOB Wherever you are in an hour. 

00:33:15
ELROY Sure! 

00:33:20
BOB That's all I'm, that's all I'm asking. Whatever you say is up to you, but just call and uh… my suggestion is don't talk too much about what we talked about here today. Is that okay? 

00:33:35
ELROY Yeah! 

00:33:40
JUDY I'd like to go get some ice-cream. 

00:33:40
ELROY Mm-hmm. Sounds good, what flavor would you like? 

00:33:45
JUDY We'll go to that. What's that place where they make anything you want, riders or something… 

00:33:50
BOB Riders. 

00:33:50
ELROY Yeah, that place. Yeah, let's go there. Sure, let's go. Well, thank you sir. 

00:33:55
BOB Okay! 

00:33:55
ELROY Thank you very much. 

00:33:55
BOB Thank you for coming. Uh… oh, I want you to switch your places. Go on, just switch. 

00:34:05
ELROY Give me a big hug Sweetie. 

00:34:10
BOB Okay! Aw…. Okay, all right! (inaudible ). All right, all right, let's… 

00:34:20
JUDY Do we still need to switch places? 

00:34:20
BOB No, no, no, you're doing better than that. Okay, let's talk about that for few minutes. 

00:34:25
ELROY Actor studio was… 

00:34:30
JUDY Yeah, no kidding, often we are. 

00:34:35
BOB Oh, yeah! 

00:34:35
ELROY Yeah. 

00:34:35
BOB Yeah. But, tell that you're, I'm not Judy. 

00:34:40
JUDY I'm not Judy. 

00:34:40
BOB And I'm not Elroy. 

00:34:40
ELROY No, I'm not. 

00:34:40
BOB All right! 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Yes, you are because… 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN I work with you man and I know your wife. 

00:35:00
BOB That's a good line. I hope you got that one now. 

00:35:00
ELROY Yeah, we got it. 

00:35:00
BOB Okay, let's talk about this. You maybe got a trouble off. 

00:35:10
ELROY No, I just wanna make sure that the camera is still… 

00:35:10
BOB Oh, it's still working. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN All right! That's, that's… 

00:35:15
BOB Let, let's talk about umm… what you observed and then what have our non Elroy and non Judy talk about. 

00:35:25
ELROY Well, we have observed that they… 

00:35:25
BOB We shall start with them. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN That was a tough one. We thought that is very, very typical, uh… maybe now people would come in, the people who are at home moving in. 

00:35:40
ELROY Yeah. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN I think one of the one of the big things that I'm served that was umm… very helpful for me umm… was something that we, we kind of talked about it as we've done little place here this week was. Right beginning in session you took your time to establish with each of them, what they wanted from coming to counseling. And I think that's something that as we all role played umm… during this time together. We've almost skipped over it or touched on it, but not taken enough time to fully develop it and jump right to the presenting problem. And then eventually, it trips you out later in the session if you haven't clearly defined that. And I really heard you taking the time to very clearly establish what was going to happen during this time together. What they each wanted? What they wanted for themselves? What they wanted from you? What they wanted from each other? And it really made the rest of the session and fall into place uh… because you could come back to where you said you wanted this. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN But, if that's not what you want anymore, then let's talk about that and when you don't take the time to set that up at the beginning of the session and the session starts to go off track, you don't have that that foundation to come back to you. So, it was, I think it was really helpful to see that… 

00:37:05
BOB Well, they can reflect on, do they want the second thing or do they want some thing different. Because, people, people do change what they want. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Right, right… 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN And it took you, took you long time to figure out, decide what they wanted. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN It was massive for me. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Well, for a while I dint think of what's so master full, but trust, trust the process and don't give up. I mean, if you wanna give up, to be honest, yeah, I felt like, I want to give up. But, uh… I knew, I knew better, I mean, I dint, I dint knew to that temptation, but umm… stay with it, something good happens. That's, that's what I learned from this. But, you know, okay, any other comments? 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN I really like the way moved in towards the plan. You give them that, the state of this code… 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN …very, very simple, very, very simple small step that you make both of them commit to it before you just told them what it was, so they wont have conditions on it. I liked that. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, I mean, it seems so simple, but it was so complex. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm! 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah! We are, okay, let's hear from you all now. 

00:38:30
JUDY Well, umm… I obviously got played, engrossed in this care turn. 

00:38:40
BOB That's true. 

00:38:40
JUDY I mean, seriously, umm… was really very interesting thing. I mean, it is just a study of total behavior, because when I was thinking those thoughts and doing those actions, I was feeling those feelings. I still feel it. 

00:38:55
BOB Mm-hmm! 

00:38:55
JUDY And my physiology, if you could have taken my temperature, oh, my God, I felt the anxiety and at one point, I thought I might have to say stop. Because, it was so strong. 

00:39:05
ELROY Yeah! 

00:39:10
JUDY And it's just a role play. But, you know, it's just like we were talking about during this week is that putting yourself into the position of somebody and understanding where that come from, helps you really to get what works and but then that's, then you feel at it and, and I definitely felt it, I mean, that, that last moment, where, might be it was real so… 

00:39:30
ELROY They were, they were. 

00:39:35
JUDY But, it just, it felt me, for, for anybody who is in a relationship. 

00:39:40
BOB Well, you're, you're uh… you got love or emotional level or it was, was I think, you're the evident, but I didn't want to, you know, there's glass that always says, " Fools rush in where angels fear to tread," I dint wanna get too much involved in that, because you just never know what's under uh… and how intense the feelings are that somebody hears it. And so I intentionally give not respond to and try to uh… encourage you to express that until the time was right. 

00:40:15
JUDY Mm-hmm! 

00:40:20
BOB And then I think, it was only uh… little bit of what, what was umm… and your gut love, I'm just guessing as, as, as observer, but… 

00:40:30
ELROY It shows how calm our engineering program is, you know. 

00:40:35
JUDY Well, the thing is umm… seriously when, when I said to you, how tough I was. 

00:40:40
BOB Yeah! 

00:40:40
JUDY That was like a pivotal thinking, but you dint say that as this point. 

00:40:40
BOB Yeah, I know. 

00:40:45
JUDY You know, because, and I, if I was, I couldn't even, I seriously could not even move forward until I said I'm so mad. 

00:40:50
BOB Yeah! 

00:40:50
JUDY I can, I could seize that, but then… 

00:40:50
ELROY And you were mad. 

00:40:50
JUDY …I couldn't, I was mad. 

00:40:55
ELROY You were mad. 

00:40:55
JUDY I was mad. I felt that very strongly for this point. 

00:40:55
ELROY Umm… I could see it. Yeah. 

00:40:55
BOB And I, I was hoping, you would say, you were not mad at me, but I wasn't… 

00:41:05
ELROY …and me, it is my character, right? 

00:41:05
BOB Yeah! 

00:41:05
JUDY That's right. 

00:41:05
ELROY Yeah! Sure, sure. 

00:41:10
JUDY Yeah, I mean, it's a role play… 

00:41:10
ELROY Yeah. 

00:41:10
BOB Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:10
JUDY We actually call it, it was a role play, but I always get that kind of, that I am. So… 

00:41:15
ELROY But, really you did it. Rest of the thing was certain things that actually happened to you, so you had some empathy there. 

00:41:20
JUDY Umm… 

00:41:20
ELROY All the people you've known or something that you drew from like method acting. 

00:41:25
JUDY just knowing people. 

00:41:25
ELROY Just knowing people. 

00:41:30
JUDY You know, I'll be in a council, I see, I see that all the time. 

00:41:30
BOB Yeah. 

00:41:30
JUDY I see it all the time and I, I get it. I understand that and umm… I'm very lucky to say, we have a good relationships and umm… but I, I, I see it and I understand it. So, it's not hard to really get into it… 

00:41:45
ELROY Right. 

00:41:45
BOB I tried to start off with a usual where you want out of this. I tried and I used something that I haven't really used it for, but which is taken from a book that will be published by John Karlson(ph), who is a colleague of Pats at Governor State University and three levels of change. One is, do you wanna work on the specific behavior? You wanna work on a pattern of behavior or do you wanna work on a ideas that are umm… transferable or I should say uh… usable without counseling. So, you might think about it, adding that to your uh… 

00:42:20
ELROY Repertory. 

00:42:25
BOB Repertory of what uh… as far as the clients want and you talked anything about that? 

00:42:30
JUDY No, but I just like kind of done that, because it was hard for me to kind of rep my head over… 

00:42:35
BOB Yeah, I… 

00:42:35
JUDY …it, it's, you know, being in as a client and being kind of on my back wheels and my emotional state. 

00:42:40
BOB Yeah! 

00:42:45
JUDY This is you know, it ain't the total behavior, because when I'm so much on my back wheels, it's very hard to think clearly, and that was little abstract. 

00:42:50
BOB You know, what I, I… 

00:42:50
ELROY It was too much, yeah, I, I spaced out there. 

00:42:55
BOB That's the first time I've done that and I think I, I was uh… as I was saying and I could kind of get a sense that this isn't uh… this isn't going anywhere, but what I, what I was, I was also trying to illustrate the, the technique and the skill. I went through the timing, it was right or whether they were quite ready for or rather than my expression of it was uh… secant enough that, that has opened for, may comment, but, but the point is, it's a good thing to think about and to utilize as, as you work, maybe I did it, I just… 

00:43:25
ELROY You made them too secant. 

00:43:25
BOB Yeah! 

00:43:30
ELROY You know, that space between the three elements… 

00:43:30
BOB Yeah! 

00:43:35
JUDY Well, when you said it the second time… 

00:43:35
BOB Yeah! 

00:43:35
JUDY …it, it was again just because of the emotion climate… 

00:43:35
BOB Yeah! 

00:43:35
JUDY …when you said the second time, then I was able to kind of take it and look at it differently… 

00:43:40
ELROY Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:40
JUDY …and there you were totally great, because it was about pattern of behavior and… 

00:43:45
BOB Yeah, you did naturally. 

00:43:45
JUDY Yeah, yeah. So… 

00:43:45
ELROY But, you ended up giving just one simple mechanism that we jump start the whole change. 

00:43:55
BOB Yeah! Well, I, I could see the doing, the doing plan, I just felt personally like, you'll always be wrong and you know, you could come up with other ideas. Doing plan at the end would, would not be uh… workable, but uh… if you could get them to just, just uh… use that mechanism of hesitating, before they set or they feel like saying spontaneously, that might be a good intervention with a, with a couple and then so… 

00:44:25
ELROY Burt, your patience over… 

00:44:25
BOB Yeah! 

00:44:25
ELROY …I mean, you just adapted us into your rhythm, you know, yeah, great. 

00:44:25
JUDY That was great, really… 

00:44:30
ELROY Yeah, what a great that was. 

00:44:35
BOB I'll take your word for that. 

00:44:35
ELROY no, I'm away with it. 

00:44:40
BOB Well, I tried to respond and oh, this, I know what I want to say uh… sometimes we get criticized and I've seen this a lot that we don't deal with the feelings or don't even talk about and I think that's uh… Romeo's uh… it seems to me that emotions are part of the true behavior and when someone for us and that's the most obvious part of their behavior, I think we have to respond to it. We can't ignore it and pretend it's not there. So, uh… respond to it and, and, and get it out in the open and it's okay and uh… we don't want necessarily having hit the pillow, you know, and, and all that kind of stuff, but uh… you must have think that's helpful, I don't know, but maybe this, who knows. But, but, but the point is that uh… respond that the gut love of the, the people haven't and maybe when there are so intellectualizing about things, just try to get them to be little warm on the gut love. Uh… so it, it was, you know, I think, it all straightly go up a number of point, little things that I was trying to touch on this counseling and uh… so, and then, and then we went from the problem solving and the griping and the criticism to a, this is a good thing to do in, in groups is to talk about their method of communication and bring it to the hearing now. Umm… as far as how did that sound to you and how did that sound to you? And could you respond in kind to that warm comment. In other words, uh… it's like, that's another part of, of this, I think is, when you feel like you're dead, going down dead on streets with people is to, is to focus on the umm… manner of communication, not just what they communicate. Otherwise, we're just solving problems which probably wont be solved until we deal with the total behavior. In this case, how are you talking to each other and what impact did it has on each other when you, when you say such and such development. 

00:46:50
ELROY Then you had us practice it one time… 

00:46:50
BOB Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:50
ELROY …which was good, so you leave on them something that it done before, sound like, they have to start fresh. 

00:46:55
BOB Yeah! 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:47:00
BOB Yes. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN When you are aware of your body language and gestures during that… 

00:47:05
BOB I think I was very much. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN …what, what did you do specifically to engage? 

00:47:10
BOB Umm… I tried to umm… no, maybe I wasn't. 

00:47:15
ELROY Did you notice it… 

00:47:20
BOB What was, what are your obstacles? 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN I'm lost. I mean, you, you and then, first of all you're in middle, okay. 

00:47:25
BOB Oh, yeah, I'm in the middle. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN And when you leaned over in front pat, in front of pan, it was like, you were protecting her from him. 

00:47:30
BOB Yeah! 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN You were a shield. That was my, from out here, this is what I saw. And then when you talked to him, you were directly in his face, you know, looking at him and saying, "Now, focus on what I'm saying. With, I want to go here and all the way down and back." That was, and then you were pushing out like that. 

00:47:50
BOB Yeah! 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN And umm… your tone and voice was always gentle and in control and yet firm, not exactly firm, but there was a boundary set by, by the voice and also by and so when they did real loud, you, "Oh…." You know, I, he went up with his hand, did you notice? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN And then uh… if you didn't like it, you pulled back and looked down and I love… 

00:48:20
BOB Oh, that part, I didn't know, but I do remember the part of, of kind of blocking their vision. 

00:48:25
ELROY He was kind of like a referee. Wasn't he? 

00:48:25
BOB So that… 

00:48:25
ELROY Yeah! 

00:48:30
BOB Yeah! To try to keep, keep them apart, not, not that that was needed physical, physically, but that it was needed, I thought emotionally at times. I think that, I do remember… 

00:48:40
ELROY But, it was a general touch. I remember, spotting was that, you would go, you don't know… 

00:48:40
BOB Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN But, that's the total picture, it's not just words…. 

00:48:45
BOB Yeah! Right, right. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN …it's not just communication, it's the whole… 

00:48:50
ELROY Yeah! 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN …the whole part. 

00:48:50
ELROY Right, right. 

00:48:55
BOB Well, they were a tough couple. I tell you. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, they were. I had a sense that… 

00:48:55
BOB They were in such, a different place in their, in their uh… total behavior. You know, that wasn't like they were, there was much unity in their, in their total behavior of, of actions and feelings. Uh… they're just, they just struck me as very different and oh, I know one thing I wanted to say, uh… in order to help them, I fought, have more control as I ask either, or, questions. One of the things that we hear about, we learn, don't ask either, or questions. Don't ask multiple choice questions. You ask open ended questions. Well, I ask a lot of either, or questions, because I don't think everybody is capable or at least willing uh… to do what is called diversion thinking which is uh… what do you wanna do today? You know, that's more than you got all these options, maybe they, may be they don't know what they are, but how about this, you wanna do this or you wanna do this? See, that, that gives a person a little bit more control over, over the thinking and over the possibilities and so that's what I was trying to do here is, keep it simple, either, or questions. Not that there's anything wrong with other types of questions, but I just wanted to illustrate the legitimacy of those kinds of interventions that you can make. 

00:50:20
ELROY She gave no choice as suppose to choose from the whole… 

00:50:25
BOB Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:25
ELROY …possible which may be cause… 

00:50:25
BOB Especially, especially, your character uh… if I did ask you some of the open ended questions, I'd have got more the same uh… kind of arrows uh… that's why I said, either one and, and, and you were both pretty good at arrows, but especially in the beginning, but, but the idea is uh… can you put the arrows in the griper for a few minutes and talk to each, each other without, without shooting, you know. 

00:50:55
ELROY Yeah! 

00:50:55
BOB And that was a tough , tough road to hold of it… 

00:50:55
ELROY Yeah! 

00:50:55
BOB …I felt really challenged. 

00:51:00
