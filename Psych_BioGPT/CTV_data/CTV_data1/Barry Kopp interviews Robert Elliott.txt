Barry Kopp interviews Robert Elliot 

00:00:15
BARRY KOPP So welcome Robert, umm… 

00:00:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Thank you. 

00:00:20
BARRY KOPP You're a professor at, umm… University of Strathclyde… 

00:00:20
ROBERT ELLIOT That's right. 

00:00:20
BARRY KOPP Umm… And I knew, you have a particular interest in research and how clients change… 

00:00:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-humm… 

00:00:25
BARRY KOPP And you've focused on personal-centered and emotional focus therapy. 

00:00:30
ROBERT ELLIOT That's right. 

00:00:35
BARRY KOPP May be to start if you could tell us a little bit more about yourself? 

00:00:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Well, You may tell from my accent that I'm, I'm an American. I was trained as a clinical psychologist in the United States. 

00:00:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:00:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And umm… I studied with a student of Carl Rogers uh… in the 1970s. 

00:00:50
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:00:50
ROBERT ELLIOT I was trained in quite broadly. 

00:00:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… 

00:00:55
ROBERT ELLIOT uh… in psychodynamic, behavior therapy, systemic therapy… 

00:00:55
BARRY KOPP Uh… hmm 

00:01:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Practiced eclectically for several years… 

00:01:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… 

00:01:00
ROBERT ELLIOT And then, umm… in 1985 I had a kind of crisis of contents… 

00:01:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:01:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And umm… came back, have, we had been on some bad economy in the United Kingdom. Umm… and I came back and started working with Les Greenberg and Laura Rice, whom I've had known for many years… 

00:01:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… 

00:01:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… To develop a therapy, which brought together, umm… the different strands of humanistic… 

00:01:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:01:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… therapy including person-centered gestalt, umm… experiential focusing oriented… 

00:01:35
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:01:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And so we began, umm… in the late 1980s developing, uh… this therapeutic approach with stress, we just called experiential, later we called it process experiential because it was… 

00:01:45
BARRY KOPP Uh… 

00:01:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Involved experience by… 

00:01:45
BARRY KOPP Uh… 

00:01:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And involved process… 

00:01:45
BARRY KOPP Absolutely. 

00:01:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Process is a series of steps… 

00:01:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:01:50
ROBERT ELLIOT And then, umm… by various sort of developments, umm… eventually it was re-branded as emotion-focus therapy… 

00:02:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:02:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… About 10 years ago or… 

00:02:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:02:05
ROBERT ELLIOT 10 to 15 years ago. Umm… but, you know, process experiential and emotion-focus therapy are the same thing… 

00:02:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:02:10
ROBERT ELLIOT They're just have names. 

00:02:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:02:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… so I came to the UK about a years ago, uh… I was, uh… took position as professor of counseling, as you said with University of Strathclyde in, in Glasgow. Umm… and I've really enjoyed being in the UK… 

00:02:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:02:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… for the opportunities and then learning and the development of the approach, the research we've been able to do… 

00:02:35
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:02:35
ROBERT ELLIOT So that's, that's where I am. 

00:02:35
BARRY KOPP And it almost sounds from what you're saying that the emotion is maybe at the center of, of what it is you're doing? I might be wrong in. And I'm sort of wondering, I am not sure, why you could, I mean, if you could tell us, what is emotional-focus therapy? 

00:02:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. So the first thing is, it's not the emotional freedom technique. 

00:02:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… right. 

00:03:00
ROBERT ELLIOT It's actually umm… someone shocked who is in training academically… 

00:03:00
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:03:00
ROBERT ELLIOT this summer thinking there was a course of, you know, emotion freedom technique, umm… and we're delighted a lot defined finally it was excellent on emotion-focus therapy. 

00:03:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:03:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… so umm… I mean, literally I pursuit a therapy that's focused on emotion. Umm… but uh… it's an acceptance based therapy. 

00:03:20
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:03:20
ROBERT ELLIOT A therapy that's based on, you know, accepting rather than pushing away emotions. 

00:03:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… Accepting those emotions that we have within us. 

00:03:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Rather than pushing them away. 

00:03:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, right. 

00:03:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Or getting stuck at then. 

00:03:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:03:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… And, umm… uh… it's also umm… this because we see emotion as a center of the change process. 

00:03:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:03:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Then it checks in our lives. We see human beings as fundamentally, emotionally uh… based, umm… creatures not just human beings, but other, you know, animals as well. Umm… and so, uh… emotion is both the center of the theory and also a center of practice. 

00:04:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:04:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… And one of my, I've a visitor he recently asked me, what's the difference between experiential therapy and emotion-focus therapy? 

00:04:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:04:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And what's the difference between experiencing emotion? right? 

00:04:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:04:15
ROBERT ELLIOT And then I said, well, you know, emotion is one kind of experience, there, there are other kinds of experiencing as well. Umm… and, umm… but we see emotion as a kind of organizing all the other experiences. 

00:04:25
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:04:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… sort of the center of people's being… 

00:04:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:04:30
ROBERT ELLIOT An existence. It organizes perceptions, it organizes bodily sensation. 

00:04:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:04:35
ROBERT ELLIOT It or coherences towards action and umm… then it gets symbolized. 

00:04:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:04:40
ROBERT ELLIOT I mean, sense of… 

00:04:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:04:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So kind of ties everything together. 

00:04:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:04:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Gives us a sense of fraternity as human beings. 

00:04:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:04:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… if we can learn how to use it, it gives us a direction for our lives… 

00:04:50
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:04:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… it gives us a reading if it's going on our lives. 

00:04:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:04:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, so that's, umm… 

00:04:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… 

00:05:00
ROBERT ELLIOT But of course people have difficulties with their emotions. 

00:05:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:05:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… They get stuck in their emotions, they get overwhelmed. 

00:05:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:05:05
ROBERT ELLIOT They get cut off from their emotions… 

00:05:05
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:05:05
ROBERT ELLIOT So umm… uh… you know, so we see emotion as kind of the base of being human uh… in the source of growth. But at the same time, umm… umm… also umm… the place where people get stuck… 

00:05:20
BARRY KOPP Right. 

00:05:20
ROBERT ELLIOT I think our clients don't come to this, usually because they got… 

00:05:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm 

00:05:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Good access to their emotions… 

00:05:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:05:25
ROBERT ELLIOT They come to us generally because they've got too much of an emotion that they find disorganizing or disregulating… 

00:05:35
BARRY KOPP Humans they're not understanding their emotions and why… 

00:05:40
ROBERT ELLIOT I Understanding… 

00:05:40
BARRY KOPP Like somehow I understand my emotions, I can somehow change that emotions… 

00:05:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Or I can get handle on them… 

00:05:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:05:40
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, I work lot of times social anxieties… 

00:05:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:05:45
BARRY KOPP So they come and they just get overwhelmed by their fear, by the people… 

00:05:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:05:50
ROBERT ELLIOT To the extent where it's destroying their lives… 

00:05:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:05:55
ROBERT ELLIOT So, so for them emotion is not their friend. 

00:05:55
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:05:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And, uh… so then we tried doing the therapy help the client to make use of their emotion… 

00:06:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:06:05
ROBERT ELLIOT And make it their friend basically. 

00:06:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:06:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… Yeah, yeah. 

00:06:10
BARRY KOPP Alright. Okay. So that's what is leading all the time. I am wondering, what the underlying philosophy of the approach? 

00:06:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Of course, that's gonna get us into jargon, right?. It's uh… I mean technically, literally the underlying philosophy something we call dialectical constructivism. 

00:06:25
BARRY KOPP Umm… what does that mean? 

00:06:25
ROBERT ELLIOT What does that mean? Right, exactly, right. Umm… so constructivism is a philosophy that says or in is interested in how people construct reality? 

00:06:35
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:06:35
ROBERT ELLIOT He appeared for PhD and his work on 

00:06:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:06:40
ROBERT ELLIOT on dev… on development. So constructivist and constructivism looks at the process of constructing ourselves on reality. 

00:06:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:06:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… EFT is umm… constructors, but it's also dialectical and that's basically a fancy word for dialogue… 

00:06:55
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:06:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Between two parts… 

00:07:00
BARRY KOPP Of ourselves? 

00:07:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… or between two people… 

00:07:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. 

00:07:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… Okay. 

00:07:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Two processes. 

00:07:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:07:05
ROBERT ELLIOT So, so their dialectics or dialogues… 

00:07:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Within the person and between persons. 

00:07:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and so we see change is coming out of these dialectical or dialogical processes… 

00:07:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:15
ROBERT ELLIOT And that, that we basically construct ourselves in dialogue… 

00:07:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
ROBERT ELLIOT With each other, that's the philosophy. That's an epistemology, it's a theory of knowledge… 

00:07:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Since how we come to know each other. 

00:07:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
ROBERT ELLIOT And say it in therapy… 

00:07:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:07:30
ROBERT ELLIOT How we come to know client?… 

00:07:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… But it's also a theory to self. 

00:07:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Because we see the self is being made of polarities… 

00:07:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:07:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and that we wanna help the client bring into dialogue with each other. 

00:07:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… constructive interaction. 

00:07:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:07:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… And so it's sort of there being, you know, so basically things come to be out of those… 

00:07:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:07:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Dialogical processes… 

00:07:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:07:50
ROBERT ELLIOT And we also come to know things in that way… 

00:07:55
BARRY KOPP Hmm… So in a sense of, yeah, in the sense, is that dialogue we have with other people or the environment around us… 

00:08:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh. 

00:08:00
BARRY KOPP And these different dialogues that we have within ourselves… 

00:08:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly, right. That's right. 

00:08:05
BARRY KOPP And that's sort of release to our understanding of, how we fit into the world in because I am emotional state to the world. 

00:08:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. Of course, one of the great dialogues in the percentage between the emotional, sort of bodily based emotional spirits. 

00:08:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:08:20
ROBERT ELLIOT And their more symbolic, rational, cultural parts. 

00:08:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, uh-huh… 

00:08:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… which they would get expressed its critical voices often or… 

00:08:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:08:30
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, voices appearance that we've internalized… 

00:08:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, Uh-huh. 

00:08:30
ROBERT ELLIOT And then, you know, sometimes try to shut down our emotions… 

00:08:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh. 

00:08:35
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, so those dialogues are really, really important. 

00:08:40
BARRY KOPP In a critics or… 

00:08:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Being critic and experience… 

00:08:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:08:40
ROBERT ELLIOT As we call it, right, that's right. 

00:08:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, uh-huh. So I wonder if we've just been talked about the philosophy. 

00:08:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh. 

00:08:45
BARRY KOPP But I wonder how EFTC's the person or maybe in particular emotions… 

00:08:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Hmm. 

00:08:55
BARRY KOPP I get the sort of release on, you know, may be what it started looking out. 

00:08:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. I mean, I guess, I mean, umm… all of those things… 

00:09:00
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:09:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… the self, the person, umm… the emotions, these are all umm… sort of constructed self organizing processes. 

00:09:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh, Uh-huh. 

00:09:10
ROBERT ELLIOT So it's all process from our point of view. 

00:09:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:09:15
ROBERT ELLIOT And these are self organizing process which means they continue to organize themselves. 

00:09:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm.. 

00:09:15
ROBERT ELLIOT As they are, umm… giving the impression of stability. 

00:09:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:09:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… to, it's really a kind of ongoing process. 

00:09:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:09:25
ROBERT ELLIOT So the self is never the same, you need to moments, right? 

00:09:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:09:30
ROBERT ELLIOT But we have the sense of self which has continuity over time. 

00:09:35
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:09:35
ROBERT ELLIOT So that's the self organizing process. And then, umm… and we have within us, what we call emotion schemes which are umm… 

00:09:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:09:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… sets of experiences which are organized around a key emotion. 

00:09:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:09:45
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, like it might be excitement being here in the interview. 

00:09:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:09:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Talking about emotion-focus therapy or it might be anxiety about, you know, umm… being, you know, on camering things like that umm… 

00:10:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:10:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… And so these emotions organize things around them… 

00:10:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:10:05
ROBERT ELLIOT And in a, umm… but there're processes… 

00:10:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:10:05
ROBERT ELLIOT They continue to self organizing… 

00:10:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:10:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And the kind of way they look stable or consistent over time. So they are consistent… 

00:10:10
BARRY KOPP Yeah, sort of it become a nice script that we, we have… 

00:10:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Kind of script… 

00:10:15
BARRY KOPP That we, we, we got, we got to buy into that we've created over time uh… 

00:10:20
ROBERT ELLIOT It is like we're continually writing the same script over and over again… 

00:10:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:10:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. Yeah. But it's, you know and maybe it'll like evolve a little bit or have variations, but it's basically the same… uh… variations in the same script… 

00:10:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:10:35
ROBERT ELLIOT That gets rewritten over and over. 

00:10:35
BARRY KOPP And we've get stuck into the script… 

00:10:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Absolutely. 

00:10:35
BARRY KOPP And emotions which can be positive all like that's right? 

00:10:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:40
BARRY KOPP So how would you see, how things get it wrong with the client or with the person? 

00:10:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, umm… so in various ways umm… I mean, they can go wrong if there is a problem with our emotion regulation because their, their optimal levels of emotions… 

00:11:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Such that if it's below that we don't have access… 

00:11:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:00
ROBERT ELLIOT We don't have access to the useful information that the… that the emotion has… 

00:11:05
BARRY KOPP Can I guess? Hold all, there's emotions that we're having, but we're not consciously aware of the… 

00:11:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Where they were… 

00:11:10
BARRY KOPP Suppressed. 

00:11:10
BARRY KOPP Suppressing. 

00:11:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:15
BARRY KOPP Resisting these emotions. 

00:11:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Pushing in the way, blocking them out, interrupting them… 

00:11:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… so that we don't have information. So that's over regulated… 

00:11:20
BARRY KOPP Right, right. 

00:11:25
ROBERT ELLIOT That can be a problem. 

00:11:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… And also the emotion can be under regulated, so that we can be overwhelmed by it, it's too much. 

00:11:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… It feels chaotic, we get overwhelmed. 

00:11:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Maybe, we even, umm… shut down because it's too much. 

00:11:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… to protect ourselves. 

00:11:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So there's a, there are problems with emotion regulation… 

00:11:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:45
ROBERT ELLIOT That's one kind of a problem the people have with their emotions. 

00:11:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:11:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Emotions also can be problematic, if they are not fully elaborated. So I not talked about how emotions bring all the different aspects of our experience together… 

00:11:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:11:55
ROBERT ELLIOT But kind of emotion it's not properly, adequately symbolize, it's hard to work with… 

00:12:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:00
ROBERT ELLIOT An emotion, which is not fully greater than body, it's not fully alive… 

00:12:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
ROBERT ELLIOT And emotion, which is not connected to its situation umm… , the, the situation, some situation a person's life with emotion merges from, uh… is not useful, uh… because if we loose the information value in emotion… 

00:12:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:20
ROBERT ELLIOT And an emotion that doesn't somehow connect to possible actions in the world also isn't serving us. 

00:12:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:12:25
ROBERT ELLIOT So emotions can be problematic if they are not fully elaborated… 

00:12:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:30
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, all their different complex Rigidness. 

00:12:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… emotions can also be problematic if one emotion covers up another emotion. 

00:12:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:12:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So we started to feel sad and then we get angry with the emotion… 

00:12:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… Which we call secondary react of emotion… 

00:12:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… so, uh… an emotion can also be, uh… problematic if, umm… it's really about some old thing that happened in our life… 

00:12:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:12:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Long time ago, all bad stuck feeling… 

00:13:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Like this is story of my life, people always let me down… 

00:13:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:05
ROBERT ELLIOT I am always going to be alone. 

00:13:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah, right. But Keeps replaying… 

00:13:05
ROBERT ELLIOT They keep replaying it. 

00:13:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:13:05
ROBERT ELLIOT And we see it, you know, in the current situation, you know… 

00:13:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… I have a little bit of a disagreement with my partner and I start feeling… 

00:13:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-hmm. 

00:13:15
ROBERT ELLIOT accessing the sense of a bad in meant or something in… 

00:13:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:20
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, I mean, we just disagreed with each other, right? 

00:13:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:20
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, that's not that she's a bad at me… 

00:13:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:20
ROBERT ELLIOT But you can feel like it. 

00:13:25
BARRY KOPP So it's a, it's a displaced emotion. 

00:13:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… displaced or we call it up "primary maladaptive emotion. 

00:13:30
BARRY KOPP Right, uh-huh. 

00:13:30
ROBERT ELLIOT First reaction… 

00:13:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:30
ROBERT ELLIOT But it doesn't fit the situation anymore. 

00:13:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And in person-centered terms these are all different incongruence… 

00:13:35
BARRY KOPP Yeah, right. 

00:13:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. So EFT kind of elaborates the notion incongruence and person-centered theory… 

00:13:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And it talks about different kinds of incongruence. 

00:13:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:45
ROBERT ELLIOT One of which is, you know, this emotion doesn't go off the situation. 

00:13:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:13:50
ROBERT ELLIOT By the old stuff. 

00:13:50
BARRY KOPP But it reminds go into the situation previously… 

00:13:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Old, the old situation. 

00:13:55
BARRY KOPP Yeah, but I learnt to use that emotion and now I am using it inappropriately. 

00:14:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. It's being a cute. 

00:14:00
BARRY KOPP Yeah, hmm. 

00:14:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Maybe, how? mean, I work with people's social anxiety… 

00:14:00
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:14:05
ROBERT ELLIOT So these folks have often histories of bullying or abuse… 

00:14:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:14:10
ROBERT ELLIOT And so now they look around as a people around them and they only look for frowny faces… 

00:14:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… they don't see anyone who's smiling at them. 

00:14:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Or looks like their places see them in. 

00:14:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:20
ROBERT ELLIOT They're, you know, they're so expecting to be judged and mistreated. 

00:14:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:25
ROBERT ELLIOT That they end up being afraid of people all the time. 

00:14:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. Whoever their self concept of protecting themselves, but trying to use… 

00:14:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:30
BARRY KOPP Stopping them. 

00:14:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly. 

00:14:35
BARRY KOPP In some way 

00:14:35
ROBERT ELLIOT This is a kind of part of them it's hurting them 

00:14:35
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:14:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Against these social dangerous… 

00:14:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… 

00:14:35
BARRY KOPP Which aren't necessarily vary anymore. 

00:14:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Anymore… 

00:14:40
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:14:40
ROBERT ELLIOT That's exactly right. Yeah, yeah. So that's another, the, that's, that's what I mean by primary maladaptive emotion response. 

00:14:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:14:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… something that's about, something that happened before… 

00:14:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:14:50
ROBERT ELLIOT But isn't about what's going on now… 

00:14:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:14:50
ROBERT ELLIOT So those are some of the different kinds of difficulties folks have, uh… as an, from an EFT point of view with their emotion. 

00:15:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… Yeah. 

00:15:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, Thank you. 

00:15:00
BARRY KOPP Fantastic. 

00:15:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:15:00
BARRY KOPP So, to leading onto that, I'm sort of wondering that for, you know, how… how you build therapeutic relationship with clients and actually maybe the long side that, how long you would expect to work for the clients? 

00:15:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. I mean so, I think, we follow generally lenient in terms of contact, before contract… 

00:15:20
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:15:20
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, so the first thing is always to make an emotional connection with the client umm… and umm… so the early part of the version therapeutic relationship is very much about bond… 

00:15:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:15:35
ROBERT ELLIOT emotional connection, the bond… 

00:15:35
BARRY KOPP Building that relationship… 

00:15:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Building that… yeah, building from emotional kind of ground. 

00:15:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:15:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And then we're gonna move it and look at, umm… where we're going with the therapy? 

00:15:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:15:45
ROBERT ELLIOT So uh… the goals and what, you know, and therapy is to try to get onboard with the client about… 

00:15:50
BARRY KOPP So you would be setting goals at that point? 

00:15:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… the therapy is going to try to get onboard with the clients goes off … 

00:15:55
BARRY KOPP Right. Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:15:55
ROBERT ELLIOT So the therapist doesn't set goals that, the therapist tries to find out… 

00:16:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:00
ROBERT ELLIOT And help the client to sharpen… 

00:16:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Or determine what they want to use the therapy for? 

00:16:05
BARRY KOPP And no longer want to be afraid of other people, for example… 

00:16:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly right, Yeah. 

00:16:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:10
ROBERT ELLIOT They wanna, I mean usually with social anxiety it set someone the person wants to get a job, have meaningful relationship, have kids… 

00:16:15
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:16:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Some important task in their life is not happening… 

00:16:20
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:16:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Because of their fear of other people… 

00:16:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:20
ROBERT ELLIOT So that they want it they go has to be able to get a job or… 

00:16:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Have a relationship. 

00:16:25
BARRY KOPP But they may not connect that immediately with, with because emotional… 

00:16:30
ROBERT ELLIOT That's true. You know. 

00:16:30
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:16:30
ROBERT ELLIOT But to do it, to do that they're gonna have to like, learn how to not to be so afraid of other people… 

00:16:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, okay. So then, so then we come into an agreement with the client about the goals of therapy. 

00:16:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:16:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And then we try, try to figure out, how we're gonna get there? 

00:16:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:16:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And EFT has a set of tasks, which are kinds of work… 

00:16:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:16:45
ROBERT ELLIOT That the client brings into session that feed into the larger goals. 

00:16:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. Work, is it homework? Kind of the other… 

00:16:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… work is in work in the session… 

00:16:55
BARRY KOPP Right. Okay. 

00:16:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Therapeutic work in the session, yeah. 

00:16:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, we don't, I mean, do much in the way homework actually… 

00:17:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… we might suggest the clients stay with a feeling that they may work in within a session, but… 

00:17:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:05
ROBERT ELLIOT We're not gonna assign homework but say … 

00:17:10
BARRY KOPP Yeah. Uh-huh… 

00:17:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Like that. Yeah, so… so the relationship then gets built in a forcefully emotional connection… 

00:17:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… 

00:17:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Then by helping the client find out what they goals are, then by, uh… beginning to work on the ways of getting near the tasks… 

00:17:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:25
ROBERT ELLIOT The kind of work… 

00:17:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:17:25
ROBERT ELLIOT We'll do that… 

00:17:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:17:25
ROBERT ELLIOT That's the EFT model relationship, which is based on the work of a man named Borden(ph)… 

00:17:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Which is psychodynamic therapist. Umm… and influenced by EFT also umm… and… and then we see the relationship as both curative in itself. 

00:17:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So the relationship is healing. 

00:17:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and uh… you know, it's deeply soothing and… and you know, someone said somewhat special with some one like social anxiety or depression… 

00:17:55
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:17:55
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, it's an antidote to the… 

00:17:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:17:55
ROBERT ELLIOT The conditions that brought the client to us. 

00:17:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:18:00
ROBERT ELLIOT But also the relationship makes it possible for us to do, uh… more difficult work with emotions… 

00:18:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:18:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Particularly, we start pulling in chairs and having people talk to furniture and things like… 

00:18:10
BARRY KOPP Right. 

00:18:10
ROBERT ELLIOT That requires quite a strong relationship. 

00:18:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. I am wondering, how that works? 

00:18:15
ROBERT ELLIOT How? 

00:18:15
BARRY KOPP How that works, meeting chairs, what do you mean? 

00:18:20
ROBERT ELLIOT So after client presents, for example uh… a piece of uh… they come to us with an unresolved grief with for example. 

00:18:25
BARRY KOPP Right, uh-hmm. 

00:18:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and umm… it feels as though there's something they haven't said… 

00:18:30
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:18:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Or something they needed from that person. 

00:18:35
BARRY KOPP Right. 

00:18:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and uh… they keep kind of blocking themselves from getting to it. 

00:18:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:18:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, they interrupt the emotion, a grief for whatever it is, the resentment umm… we'll pull up an empty chair another chair… 

00:18:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:18:50
ROBERT ELLIOT And how the client imagine that person present in the room? 

00:18:55
BARRY KOPP Alright. 

00:18:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And talk to them… 

00:18:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:18:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. And, you know, that's the way of helping the client access the deeper emotions. 

00:19:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and once the client accesses the deeper emotions, we call the core, their core pain… 

00:19:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… we ask them what that core pain needs, the part that hurts the most, with that needs? Umm… and then we work with that I mean that need. 

00:19:20
BARRY KOPP It sounds like always trusting that it's the client that knows, what about pain is? And what about pain need is? Not such as a therapist. 

00:19:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. You know, we don't, I mean, you know, we say that the client is the expert on their experience. 

00:19:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:30
ROBERT ELLIOT We know a lot about process is… 

00:19:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:35
ROBERT ELLIOT So we're kind of process expert… 

00:19:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:35
ROBERT ELLIOT But we don't even know which process is gonna that this client needs in this moment… 

00:19:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. So, but we have lots of things we can offer… 

00:19:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:19:45
ROBERT ELLIOT That's experimental things. 

00:19:45
BARRY KOPP So I am sort of wondering with that too, with us having that knowledge of the different processes that may or may not help… 

00:19:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:19:55
BARRY KOPP That something about offering, trying, but it's not working… 

00:20:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Try out something else… 

00:20:00
BARRY KOPP Try out something else that's not to mean doggedly, rigid to particular person. 

00:20:05
ROBERT ELLIOT I think, you know, one of the things people notice about EFT practices, how active we are. 

00:20:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:20:10
ROBERT ELLIOT We talk a lot, umm… we you know, we're actually quite active. 

00:20:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:15
ROBERT ELLIOT And, umm… you could say, we get a lot of things wrong. 

00:20:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:20
ROBERT ELLIOT You know that we've, we… 

00:20:20
BARRY KOPP Just a real relationship… 

00:20:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, yes, exactly. 

00:20:20
BARRY KOPP I am possibly knew what's right. 

00:20:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly. 

00:20:25
BARRY KOPP So I am just, I'm in this two way for you with you. 

00:20:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, so… 

00:20:25
BARRY KOPP And hopefully between us we can find… 

00:20:30
ROBERT ELLIOT That's right. 

00:20:30
BARRY KOPP I think we'll work. 

00:20:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Someone did a study recently possessed recently in which they found that client of EFT therapy disagree within more. 

00:20:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And, you know, what? That's really cool with us. 

00:20:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:40
ROBERT ELLIOT We like when our clients disagreeing. 

00:20:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… so we're, you know, in that act, activeness, we're, umm… do get things not quite right… 

00:20:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:50
ROBERT ELLIOT And were very, very quick to adjust, change directions… 

00:20:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:20:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And follow the client. 

00:20:55
BARRY KOPP And I guess with the client that having up how it seems like, you're getting wrong… 

00:21:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh. 

00:21:00
BARRY KOPP You know, that's not right, that require empowering and liberating for the client as well. 

00:21:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Absolutely, yeah, yeah. 

00:21:10
BARRY KOPP So how you mention the risks of chairs, I am wondering of type of techniques, you might go wrong? 

00:21:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Well, EFT has a whole set of different methods. 

00:21:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Lik we actually don't like to call them techniques. 

00:21:20
BARRY KOPP huh… 

00:21:20
ROBERT ELLIOT We call them tasks. Right Yeah. 

00:21:25
BARRY KOPP Tasks specialty. 

00:21:25
ROBERT ELLIOT But they, they're not mechanical I think… 

00:21:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… they're experiments more like… 

00:21:30
BARRY KOPP Right. Yeah. 

00:21:30
ROBERT ELLIOT And maybe, you could start sense.. 

00:21:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… so we use, uh… a two-chair, a two chair process for internal conflicts. 

00:21:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Say between a critical internal voice… 

00:21:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And apart that's been criticized… 

00:21:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And we'll call experience. 

00:21:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:21:45
ROBERT ELLIOT So we'll set up a dialogue… 

00:21:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:21:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… or have the client help, uh… having, have helped them have a dialogue between a critical voice… 

00:21:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:50
ROBERT ELLIOT And aparts that's being criticized. 

00:21:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:21:50
ROBERT ELLIOT So that's another one. We use focusing, so we have the clients slow down and turn their attention… 

00:22:00
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Access what's with them or… 

00:22:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:22:00
ROBERT ELLIOT What's maybe not so clear to the moment. 

00:22:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:22:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… we umm… if the client is feeling overwhelmed, that's, which is one of the forms disregulation… 

00:22:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-huh… 

00:22:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… we might help the client to, umm… clear the space 

00:22:15
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… by uh… naming and setting aside the different things that are bothering them… 

00:22:20
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… we use, umm… the most recent redeveloped technique or task, umm… is uh… called self-soothing. 

00:22:30
BARRY KOPP Huh. 

00:22:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Just when the client is feeling sort of wounded or highly vulnerable… 

00:22:35
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Or walk emotionally, umm… and we helped the client figure out what that rawness needs… 

00:22:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:22:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And then we have them come over and offer that to themselves… 

00:22:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Find some way, something in them. 

00:22:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:22:50
BARRY KOPP They can offer them. 

00:22:50
BARRY KOPP So finally what they need and finally how they're going to get it? 

00:22:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:22:55
BARRY KOPP I think some… 

00:22:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, comforting that way of that painful feeling, right. 

00:23:00
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:23:00
ROBERT ELLIOT That's the most recently developed EFT method… 

00:23:05
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:23:05
ROBERT ELLIOT We also use some methods for really helping people, re-experiencing, you know, like telling story and kind of going back into it if present tenses as if it's happening now in movie… 

00:23:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:23:15
ROBERT ELLIOT What we called unfolding. 

00:23:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and then processing difficulties in the relationship, all you know, so lots of different things… 

00:23:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:23:25
ROBERT ELLIOT We develop. 

00:23:25
BARRY KOPP So very, umm… rich, dynamic, umm… collect in use of different tasks and… 

00:23:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess, I am allergic to the word collector, but it's integrative… 

00:23:35
BARRY KOPP Integrative, yeah. 

00:23:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Right. Because it's just kind of a framework for bringing things in, in kind of logical organized. 

00:23:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm 

00:23:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And manner. 

00:23:45
BARRY KOPP I mean, let I do this framework, which make me draw different things… 

00:23:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly. 

00:23:50
BARRY KOPP Into that fills appropriated works. 

00:23:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah. 

00:23:50
BARRY KOPP Particular. 

00:23:55
ROBERT ELLIOT And yet Since have the whole thing, be a kind of whole… 

00:23:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:23:55
ROBERT ELLIOT In whole therapy… 

00:23:55
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:23:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Put together, yeah. 

00:24:00
BARRY KOPP And I am wondering, you've been in industry at day and night when sort of research is so important… 

00:24:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:24:10
BARRY KOPP Umm… I wonder how research or what research we thought in for client form research particularly way of work. 

00:24:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Well, EFT came out of research… 

00:24:15
BARRY KOPP Right. Uh-huh… 

00:24:15
ROBERT ELLIOT It was developed through, uh… research in the 1970s using a method called task analysis. 

00:24:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:24:25
ROBERT ELLIOT which was uh… taken from cognitive science. 

00:24:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:24:30
ROBERT ELLIOT And, umm… where, you know, researchers we're using to study how expert solve problems? 

00:24:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:24:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… and what Rice and Greenberg did, was they said, umm… let's see, let's see if we can study the client expertise? 

00:24:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:24:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh… So they got, example, they collected examples of clients resolving specific kinds of tasks like… 

00:24:45
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:24:50
ROBERT ELLIOT An internal conflict or… 

00:24:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:24:50
ROBERT ELLIOT Or unfinished business, they collected these examples and particularly with the clients resolve them, now where they got stuck. They took successful client performances and then essentially reverse engineered them. 

00:25:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:25:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Figured out how the client did that? 

00:25:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:25:05
ROBERT ELLIOT So then want to know how clients successfully resolve the task and therapy? As a therapist you can then provide them… 

00:25:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:25:10
ROBERT ELLIOT With resources to do that… 

00:25:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm.… So there always a back which helps you being successful in therapy… 

00:25:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Exactly. 

00:25:15
BARRY KOPP And was that… 

00:25:15
ROBERT ELLIOT They got you there. 

00:25:20
BARRY KOPP I got you that, so sort of like that locus umm… research from client, in fact is the, you know, that 80% of the clients thinks about what is the… 

00:25:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah, yeah, exactly. 

00:25:25
BARRY KOPP What is the client doing? I mean the therapist doing for the client? 

00:25:30
ROBERT ELLIOT In terms of the history of the development of the approach, umm… you know, in the person-centered, the person-centered kind of tree… 

00:25:35
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:25:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Kind of split into two main branches around 1960… 

00:25:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:25:40
ROBERT ELLIOT And, you know, there was a sort of part they've developed in the 1950s around therapeutic conditions more of them but they genuine as… 

00:25:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:25:50
ROBERT ELLIOT That was focused more on the therapist and then with the work of Gen Lind and his colleagues in the 1960s the work this is worth of land developed focusing… 

00:26:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:26:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… uh… There was more focus on the client. 

00:26:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm, Right. 

00:26:00
ROBERT ELLIOT What's the client's process? How the clients deepen their experience? How did they… 

00:26:05
BARRY KOPP Uh… 

00:26:05
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, access and include for sense putting them, you know, some pleasant, so there's more to focus on instead experiential branch of the person –centered tree that be, that EFT eventually grow out of. 

00:26:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm… this is not just the therapist, the therapy prepared in this condition that some think about more the client and what are the client's experiences? or what… 

00:26:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah I mean it's sense… it's sensually about the client. 

00:26:25
BARRY KOPP Yeah, alright. 

00:26:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Right, yeah, that… that I mean, and we're there to help the client to change themselves. 

00:26:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:26:35
ROBERT ELLIOT So we, you know, we've learned various things as I said for studying… 

00:26:40
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:26:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Successful client resolutions or we can offer… 

00:26:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:26:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… but we're really and the client is the active change agent, it's really, you know, getting onboard with the clients on agency… 

00:26:50
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:26:50
ROBERT ELLIOT To change themselves you know… 

00:26:55
BARRY KOPP Yeah. 

00:26:55
ROBERT ELLIOT So, so there was a, their recent initial research was just task analytical research successful you know, really process research studying our clients uh… resolve things. And then in 1980s we started looking at specific kinds of client experiences like… 

00:27:10
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:27:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Things that clients got out of the sessions, we called therapeutic reactions, we started, we were looking at therapists, which different kinds of therapists response modes, umm… and then we started doing outcome research, which before that… 

00:27:25
BARRY KOPP Hmm. 

00:27:25
ROBERT ELLIOT which before that we've thought was evil, right? 

00:27:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Then we were process researchers, umm… but… but we are particularly interested in change processes. 

00:27:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
ROBERT ELLIOT How do clients change in therapy? 

00:27:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And to do that we actually need to study change, need to see if there's change that'll happened. 

00:27:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:40
ROBERT ELLIOT So we started doing outcome research, we started studying depression. Umm… and then in the 1990s we started developing more and more sophisticated models of will client change process? 

00:27:50
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:50
ROBERT ELLIOT So today EFTs got a very strong base of outcome research… 

00:27:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:27:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… It's got its original foundation of process research. It's got research on change processes. 

00:28:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Things that predict outcome… 

00:28:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:00
ROBERT ELLIOT Specific events that happens. So it's actually very thoroughly evidence base therapy. 

00:28:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. And that was really important that… 

00:28:10
ROBERT ELLIOT It is. 

00:28:10
BARRY KOPP what, what, what you're doing is research and supported by the research with 30, 40 years… 

00:28:20
ROBERT ELLIOT That's right. Yeah, yeah, go back in the 1970s. 

00:28:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:28:25
BARRY KOPP A long time. 

00:28:25
ROBERT ELLIOT Yeah. 

00:28:25
BARRY KOPP So I am wondering umm… maybe finally why, why do you think EFT makeover in the future? 

00:28:35
ROBERT ELLIOT Well, EFT continually applies itself to new client groups. As I said, we started with depression… 

00:28:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:40
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and then in the 1990s we started studying trauma… 

00:28:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Post-trauma umm… and then when, about the time I moved to Scotland eight years ago uh… where our service began to look at anxiety… 

00:28:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:28:55
ROBERT ELLIOT Because we've been ignoring client again and again so different kinds of anxieties takes, so… so I've been talking about social anxiety, but I've got callings who's studying general anxiety… 

00:29:05
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:05
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and so at each time we do this, we develop the therapy further. 

00:29:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:10
ROBERT ELLIOT So now umm… we're looking at umm… umm… working with the clients with psychotic processes… 

00:29:15
BARRY KOPP Right. 

00:29:15
ROBERT ELLIOT So what is EFT look like with psychosis? 

00:29:20
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:20
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… clients with cancer. So, you know, the people dealing with chronic severe mental, medical conditions such as cancer. 

00:29:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:25
ROBERT ELLIOT What is EFT look like with cancer? Eating difficulties? 

00:29:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:30
ROBERT ELLIOT What is EFT look like? There's groups' working in all these areas now. 

00:29:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:35
ROBERT ELLIOT And as they do that, they developed the therapy further. 

00:29:35
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm, right. So there are subtle differences or big differences between different client groups? 

00:29:40
ROBERT ELLIOT There are big and subtle difference, both. 

00:29:45
BARRY KOPP yeah, uh-hmm, uh-hmm. 

00:29:45
ROBERT ELLIOT Umm… and yes and I mean one of part of the EFT philosophy is that when you were look at a particular client group, you wanna spend time really understanding… 

00:29:55
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:29:55
ROBERT ELLIOT how that group of clients, that population sees the world and kinds of wishes they bring… 

00:30:00
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:00
ROBERT ELLIOT You know, so, you know, even something like to share work you know, internal conflict, you know, working with a depart… uh… self criticism split or conflict and depression… 

00:30:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:10
ROBERT ELLIOT Is different from the social anxiety… 

00:30:10
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:15
ROBERT ELLIOT Conflicts I work with where people are making themselves freedom of the people… 

00:30:15
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:15
ROBERT ELLIOT So there are these differences in what the tasks look like between different client groups? And also there are different tasks… 

00:30:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:25
ROBERT ELLIOT That we come to using or so… 

00:30:25
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:25
ROBERT ELLIOT We started working with trauma, we started working with more narrative processes and, you know, meaning protests around… 

00:30:30
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:30
ROBERT ELLIOT Creation of meaning and things like that. Yeah, so that's sort of, so basically the future for EFT, I think is around developing the approach more tasks, differentiating existing tasks… 

00:30:40
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:45
ROBERT ELLIOT As we sort of look at different client groups. 

00:30:45
BARRY KOPP Uh-hmm. 

00:30:45
ROBERT ELLIOT And that's actually quite exciting and quite interesting for us. 

00:30:50
BARRY KOPP Had huge futures and the puff is not yet finished it, what? 

00:30:55
ROBERT ELLIOT By no means the way… 

00:30:55
BARRY KOPP Just starting umm… Well, thank you very much for your time and for sharing your knowledge and experiences over EFT. 

00:31:05
ROBERT ELLIOT You're welcome, it's a pleasure.
