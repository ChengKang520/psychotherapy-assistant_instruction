RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone, to our series on 21st century parenting skills. My name’s Rich Simon, I’m editor of Psychotherapy Networker. I’m your host for the series. So, in this series, we’re looking at the range of challenges that today’s parents face, and the realities that our traditional clinical training often does not prepare us to be as helpful as we might be with parents, given the changing nature of society and the challenges of child rearing. So one reality that's a part of all our lives is different, certainly when I was growing up, is that we have alot more stepfamilies. We have more divorce, we have more remarriage than we had back in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, and that's a reality of the world, and we’re just, as a society and as a profession, we’re catching up with those realities, and we have someone with us today who’s really going to help us catch up on these realities. Someone who’s specialized in working with stepfamilies over the decades in her own career, Patricia Papernow. Patricia, welcome. 

00:01:30
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Glad to be here. 

00:01:30
RICH SIMON So, let’s just, let’s start us off here. How did you get interested in stepfamilies? How did you become one of the, one of our field’s leading experts on stepfamily life? 

00:01:45
PATRICIA PAPERNOW By accident. I married somebody with two kids, they were five and nine when I met him, and a few years later I needed a dissertation, and my family had changed over the years, and it was probably that the kids were getting older, but there was something happening in the family, and so I did a dissertation on stages of development in stepfamilies. At that time, there was nothing to read, my lit review was a cinch. I'm now writing a second book, and the literature has exploded since then. So I was in that marriage for ten years, I was then single for ten years, I have had a little a girl from my first marriage, and then 15 years ago met my second husband, my daughter was at the perfect age for total disaster. She was 13. 

00:02:40
RICH SIMON Oh dear. Okay. 

00:02:40
PATRICIA PAPERNOW And she’d had a very painful relationship with her own dad, so it was a very hard start. My husband has three kids a little older than my daughter, and so now, 15 years down the road, my stepkids are all married, I have six stepgrandchildren, my kid has a boyfriend, so there’s alot of people when we have Thanksgiving. 

00:03:05
RICH SIMON So you're doing multigenerational research on stepfamily life. So, one of the things in our conversations that you refer to regularly is what you call blogger boo boos. Misconceptions about stepfamilies that are out there in the media. What do you mean by that? What are some of these misconceptions? 

00:03:25
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, it’s partly the fault of people like me who haven’t been writing for 15 years, but there’s been a huge gap in good information, and people have stepped into that gap, and now we have the internet, we can multiply this information exponentially. So the first thing is that stepfamilies and first time families are very different. First time families and stepfamilies build relationships on very different foundations. So the, in a first time family the adult couple has time alone together, they have time for a honeymoon. To ride that yummy river of attachment, and lull around each other and goggle at each other, but this kind of begins to work out some of their differences, to enjoy some of their similarities without interruption from kids. So in a first time family, kids join that sort of thickening web of connections between the adults, and everything changes when a kid is born, we all know that, however, in a first time family, there is already some sense of connection. You know, remember when we were close, we have figured out how to load the dishwasher without killing each other, and you have that to fall back on. The other thing is that kids, when things go well enough, are born hardwired to connect to parents and vice versa, not that it doesn’t always go perfectly, but that's the way we’re set up, and so over time, in a first time family, the sense of connection, if things are going well enough, deepens, the understandings about how we do things develop, everything from what we eat for breakfast, noise, how we do holidays. So by the time kids are say seven and ten, alot of things no longer need discussion, they're just accepted, even the differences are normal. In a stepfamily, if that family doesn't go well, and it breaks up, the stepfamily begins with the primary attachments between parents and kids, and the agreements about everything from what is the appropriate pair, cost of a pair of sneakers, I can’t tell you how many couples come in arguing over the cost of a pair of sneakers, and in my family, what is breakfast food? Is Grapenuts a breakfast food or a form of cardboard? We were on the breakfast food side, and my husband’s family was sure it was cardboard, because they ate sugar cereal. All of those agreements are between parents and kids, not between the adult couple, so the adult couple may be madly in love, but the deeply grooved attachments and the easy, easy agreements are between parents and kids. That’s a very, very different foundation, and that means every time a kids walks into the room or enters the conversation, parents and stepparents have a fundamentally different experience. The parent is a stuck insider, so you know, my kid doesn’t get invited to Yolanda’s birthday party, and she thought Yolanda was her best friend, so my kid gets off the bus, and she’s running home, meanwhile, my partner has finally garnered a moment alone with me, and we are having a conversation. My kid bursts into the door, and who does she want to talk to? Me. She comes flying at me sobbing, what do I do? I turn to my kid and put my arms around her, and what happens to my partner? He’s left like chopped meat, and it happens over and over and over again in stepfamilies. At the dinner table, all the time. So that means stepparents are stuck outsiders, and parents are stuck insiders, and just having that language, I just heard from somebody who’s been married for 15 years as well, she’d never heard that language. It was very comforting to her, because it’s an attachment break at a moment that you think you're on the same page you’re not, you're really not. You see things very, very differently. So that’s a totally different foundation for parenting, and now you can go back and kids come into a stepfamily very differently than a first time family. You know, the adults are thrilled, we finally found each other, I’d been alone for ten years when I met my second husband, but what is a wonderful gift for adults is often a whole nother set of losses for kids, and the way that I often describe this, I think I've described this to you before is that if you think about if you have a friend who just went gaga over a new love, and you're sitting at the table with them, and they’re eyeballing each other and snuggling, you feel like leftover meat, and do you really want to watch them kiss? Not really, and now imagine if you're a kid and one of those people who’s gone gaga is your parent, and there’s not another parent to turn to. Kids talk alot about the sense of loss, that they’ve lost their parent’s attention, that they now have to compete for attention, it’s real, and adults can help by getting that it’s real. Adults often say nothing has changed, and the research is that parents believe nothing has changed, and kids feel alot has changed, so just getting that can be very important. So that sets up a whole bunch of differences, one other thing, with kids, loyalty (inaudible ). If I care about my stepparent, I have betrayed my parent, and these happen even in pretty collaborative divorces. I think it’s genetic, and sometimes one kid is more distant than most, and that kid is often especially close to a parent in the other family, so it’s always helpful to ask if you hear a stepparent say, ‘She treats me like a piece of furniture, at best. Your other kid’s okay, but this kid isn’t.’ Ask if that kid is especially close to the parent in the other family, and often that’s true. Often that parent isn't even badmouthing, they’re just close, and in those cases, it’s very helpful just to release the parent and this kid, not to try to strain to get close, just give that kid a little more space. 

00:10:20
RICH SIMON So when you do your trainings, and you talk to your colleagues about stepfamilies who maybe don’t have that background, what is it that therapists, that we don't get, that secretly important in being as helpful as we can be to these families? 

00:10:40
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, I think one of the big blogger boo boos is that the step parent needs to be supported in a disciplinary role by the parent, and it makes logical sense, I mean what do adults do in families? They parent. But there are a bunch of problems with that, the first is that the research is pretty clear that, kids just aren't ready. They aren't ready for step parents to step into a disciplinary role. It works alot better when parents maintain the disciplinary role, and what I say to step parents is connection before correction. It’s actually helpful for parents, too, but for step parents, it’s pretty solid rule. And I think the thing that we can bring from the rest of our work is that the best parenting for kids is what we call authoritative parenting. Authoritative parenting is warm and connected and empathic and also makes clear realistic demands for kid behavior and follow through. The problem is, and this is something therapists will see alot in your office. You’ll see the step parents saying, ‘Your kid’s a slob, your kid’s manipulative, your kid’s rude,’ and the parents saying, ‘But she’s just a kid, you're too harsh, you're over reacting,’ and of course, the less the parent gets it, the more the step parent ups the ante. It’s very sometimes helpful, but certainly helpful that therapists know this kind of polarization is very normal, you hear it all the, in fact, I could give you a, you give me a dialogue, I’ll tell you who’s the parent and who’s the step parent. Turns out, of course, what’s best for kids, what I say to couples is, turns out you both have a piece of the truth. Kids need warmth, they need connection, they also need clarity about what the rules are, and what’s realistic, and that means step parents and parents have to influence each other, it works best, and this is another thing for therapists to know, if step parents have input, parents have final say. Out of kids’ earshot. Now here’s the dilemma, though, right? The parent is pulled to a more set of permissive style often, and the step parent is pulled to a more authoritarian style, and they polarize, and every conversation, I mean it’s amazing, it’s like you start out to do a waltz, and you end up in a tango on the floor over and over and over again. When couples start into this, I often say to them, “I'm believing you've had this conversation before. Am I right?’ I’ve never heard anybody say no, and I'm betting it goes the same way each time, ‘Am I right?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I bet you'd like to have it differently.’ ‘Yes.’ 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON So one of the things you say is this difference between parenting and step parenting, and so how do we help someone like myself, I have been a step parent, and continue after 20 years in some ways I am the step parent. What is it about, what’s the distinction here, between the parenting and step parenting? 

00:14:15
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, the parent has a relationship, the parent has the context and history, but most of all the parent has the relationship. So the parent knows more about what’s realistic, what the kid can and can't do. Like my kid had major learning disabilities, and my husband said, ‘Why can't she do her homework upstairs? Like a normal child.’ She can't, she needs to do it at the kitchen table where I can help her. The compromise was she would clean up the stuff after two hours of leaving it all there. So, that’s the first thing, that parents have the connection, they know who their kid is, and kids are open to discipline from the parents. They are not open to discipline from step parents in the beginning. Step parents really have to start by making a relationship, and that sometimes means tolerating being pushed away, and I always say to parents no matter how much you understand that the kids have a good reason to push you away, it’s hard, give your partner a hug, don’t tell them to be too sensitive, give them a hug. It’s hard when a child comes into the room and looks straight at you and doesn't look at your partner. I would say to step parents start to get to know your kid. Find some one to one time. Separate from the parents, doing something shoulder to shoulder. Now, I'm a therapist, I like it eyeball to eyeball, I want to get to know the kid, but the kid isn’t ready for that, shoulder to shoulder, do something together. My stepdaughter in my second marriage took me shopping, my, one of my boyfriends taught my daughter how to pitch and hit a ball, those kinds of things are really good step parent step kid things, and it’s a tough role, it’s not easy to be an adult where you don't have control. Kids do things that are irritating. You didn’t grow up with them. My kid leaves a mess in the kitchen, I’m just glad she made her own peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That is much more irritating for my husband than it is for me, because it’s not his kid, and step parents can, once they make a warm connection, they can sometimes move into an authoritative parenting role, warm and connected and firm and clear. Authoritarian, almost never works for a step parent. It’s not good parenting to start with, but with a step parent, it’s just too toxic. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON What about the variable of the kid’s age? How does that make a difference when you have (inaudible ) of a teenager? 

00:17:08
PATRICIA PAPERNOW (crosstalk)We do have, yeah it makes a big difference. Kids under nine tend to find it more easy, and kids, adolescents the hardest, preadolescent girls are the very hardest, and what we think is, alot of the stepfamilies that are studied are stepfather families, girls get very close to their mothers in single parent families. It’s often a very positive relationship, and then mom falls in love, and she becomes a lovesick teenager and turns very much away from her kid, so the shift into a stepfamily tends to be harder for girls, easier for boys, and especially preadolescent and adolescent girls. If you can ride through it, things do work out over time often. 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON Okay, so let’s move into, you’ve laid the groundwork and you've established some of the things you’ve discovered to be misconceptions about stepfamilies and step parenting. So when people, this is an audience, people who are working with kids and stepfamiles and working doing family therapy and child therapy and so on, so take us, when a stepfamily comes in, or if there’s a stepfamily sitation involved in a case that you're involved in, how is, how do you handle that any different than any other kind of family or child situation or any kind of therapeutic situation that you're seeing? What’s distinctive about that for you? 

00:18:45
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, the first thing is that meeting with the whole family, just like doing things with the whole family is often disastrous. There’s just too much going on. Their needs are too at odds, and the intensity is too high, and challenges are most intense. So, in work with stepfamilies, as in living in a stepfamily, work in subsystems, that’s the first thing. So you may want to meet with the adult couple, you may want to meet with parent kid, you probably save step parent and kid for late after things are better in the other relationship, and every now and then the step parent is the resource, every now and then the step parent is sort of the savior for the kid. Lots of times the step parent thinks they’re the savior, but the kid doesn't. When the kid, every now and then you have a situation like that that but usually, the step parent step kid relationship comes last, meet with the step sibs, and if you’re brave, and you have a good, firm hand, meet with the ex spouses, because that’s often critical for kids. 

00:19:50
RICH SIMON Okay, and so and then how, there’s a whole question I guess of giving folks a map of this territory, so how do you do this? There’s a certain element of psychoeducation in the way you work, as I understand it, isn't there? 

00:20:10
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Yeah, you know, some of us were trained as systems therapists, and we’re not supposed to pay attention to content, and the original Stepfamily Association of America paid attention to psychoeducation and didn't pay attention to any of the rest. Some of us who are interpsychically trained try to go there. The truth is, I think we have to work on three levels. All three levels. The first is psychoeducation, people need a map, and we know some things about what works and what doesn’t. The thing about psychoeducation is that it usually gets the therapist into spewing, they’re just so eager for people to have every bit of information, and very important to go, Sue Johnson calls it low and slow, one piece of information at a time, and what’s that like to hear from me? Can you do it? So there’s some skills involved in psychoeducation (inaudible ), passive information. So the first level is psychoed, the second is skills. We know that couples who are able to be more positive with each other do better, and that’s true in step families as well, but you can already hear there are many, many, many opportunities to make a mess, and it’s very helpful to people often to learn a few basic skills like even something as dumb to therapists as I messages as opposed to you messages, going a sentence or two at a time, taking a breath. Those things are very, very, very helpful, and then the third level is interpsychic. I have a thing I call (inaudible ) theory of feeling if you bang your arm in a place where it’s healthy, it hurts, and there’re lots of bruises in any family and stepfamilies, lots and lots of bumps and grinds, but if there’s already a bruise there, if you were hurt really badly there, and I even touch it, you're going to have what we call a trauma response. You're going to fight, flight, freeze, your triggering is going to be much more intense, so if you come into a step parent position, it’s not fun to be left out, it’s really not fun to sit there and have a kid come into a room and not look at you. It’s very difficult, and if in your family of origin you were the unfavored child, it was an alcoholic family where there wasn’t enough attention to go around, you were harassed by an uncle and there was nobody to tell about it, then being a step parent is just going to be blindingly, blindingly painful, and really important that we not start on that level. I mean, people walk into your office, it’s intense. These are my hardest couples, but you don't know how much of the intensity is the people are traveling difficult territory with the wrong map. I mean, have you ever been some place where you didn’t know the territory, and you had a wrong map or bad driving directions? I mean, how easy to pick a fight with your partner, you know? Things get tense, but if you have a really good map, it makes a difference, right? 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so how does that sound? So if would that first session, talk a little bit about who you might invite to such a first session, and what are the kinds of things that you will say to a stepfamily, whatever subsystems or however it is that you decide that you want to see them? 

00:23:55
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, I think the first thing is who you work with depends on your training. I'm actually mostly a couples therapist, so I do see alot of couples. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:05
PATRICIA PAPERNOW And, by the way, often, this is not answering your question, I will get back to it, often an adult will call and say, ‘I want help for my kid. My kid is not adjusting. My child is resisting.’ Very often in these families it’s the adult, you can help the kid by helping the adult. So, important to ask how fast is this going? Often times it’s going too fast for the kid. To see if the parent is attuned to the child, because often the parent will tell the parent story, which is ‘my child is being manipulative and resistant.’ The child story is there has been a ton of changes here, it’s way too much for me. If the parent can tell the parent story and the child story, that’s a little better, but if the parent sees the kid as behaving badly, often times parents need some help understanding what’s going on with the kids. So back to often what I have in my office is a couple, and the conversation often goes, the step parent says, ‘Every time your child is here, I’m invisible. I'm like a lump on a log. You pay total attention to your kids, and it’s like I don't exist.’ And the parent says, ‘What is your problem? They're my kids. You're too sensitive.’ And the step parent says, ‘But I'm your wife.’ And on and on and on. It’s a conversation I've heard over and over and over again. If it’s a couple, I don't let people tangle a whole lot in my office. I’ll let them go two or three sentences til I recognize the pattern. Now, I recognize the pattern really fast, because, but I don't want people to feel that they can make a mess in my office, because they already do that at home. So I’d be likely to stop them, and I probably start with psychoed, and I stop and say, ‘My hunch is you've had this conversation before,’ and they always say yes, and it’s not going well, am I right? And it goes poorly the same way each time? Yes. ‘Can I help you have it better? But before we do that, I want to tell you something about what’s making this difference between you, because my hunch is almost every conversation one of you says I'm left out and one of you says don't make me choose, right? It’s because you live in a stepfamily, and in a stepfamily parents are the stuck insiders. You started a relationship with your child, you guys have been through alot together, you have agreements on what you do with a wet towel, about noise, about food that started way before this new person, this new adult got here. So every time a child walks into the room, parent and kid are stuck, the parent is the stuck insider, and the step parent, you the step parent are a stuck outsider, and these positions have big feelings. People who are stuck outsiders often feel left out, they often feel invisible, and people who are stuck insiders often feel torn. Does that, what’s that like to hear from me?’ I say it’s alright. And that’s what I probably, at first I find out what it’s like to hear, because some people are relieved, some people are thrilled to have good information, and some people are really disappointed, so the first thing I want to find out where they are. Lots of times they're relieved. And then I, usually with a couple, would turn them to each other. You need to tell him what a relief it is to know that this outsider position is normal, even though it’s miserable. You tell her what a relief it is to hear that this position of being torn is not because something’s wrong with you, you're inadequate, you're not good enough. So that's the first piece, you do a little psychoed, and- 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)What’s the disappointment part? How does that- 

00:28:20
PATRICIA PAPERNOW (crosstalk)That I didn’t get married for this. I didn't get married to be left out. 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:28:25
PATRICIA PAPERNOW I'm going to guess there might be some trauma history there, but I don't know yet, I’m just going to start making a genogram. I might ask who are the people in the family you came from, who are the insiders and the outsiders, I probably would not go alot further at that point, because it’s too early, I'm just getting to know them, and they’re in difficult territory with the wrong map, so I might say, ‘You know, if you’re a step parent who came from a place where you were the outsider, it makes this tougher. We’ll get back to this another time. Meanwhile, partner, parent, can you get what that’s like for her? It’s a double whammy. Can you find, in your body, what you do understand about what that’s like for her, and can you tell her what you do understand?’ 

00:29:15
RICH SIMON So the first step for you is usually a normalizing. What people are bringing is you're putting it, and you're saying, ‘That’s the territory.’ 

00:29:25
PATRICIA PAPERNOW That’s right, although I think it’s really important to start with empathizing, because if you're really upset and I say it’s really normal that your kid is stepping on your toe, I mean, and I learned this by watching people role play, when I do a workshop and I see them say, ‘That’s normal,’ and the poor client, the person playing the client is like, ‘So?’ 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)To make sure that gets communicated, how does that part sound? How do you say it so not only are you saying this normalizing, but you're also getting with them and the immediacy of their experience. 

00:30:05
PATRICIA PAPERNOW That’s right. If I'm sitting with a couple, really important that I capture the feeling of both the insider and the outsider. If you're the stuck insider, and every time a kid walks into the room or the conversation, you are the stuck outsider, you feel left out, you feel invisible. You are the stuck insider, you feel torn, you feel like you can’t please all the people that you love, did I get that right? That’s the empathy piece. 

00:30:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:30:35
PATRICIA PAPERNOW And here’s a really important piece. I’m glad you asked this question, because if you are working with an individual, it’s a kind of compassion trap, because we’re compassionate people, right? So you’re the step parent, and you come to me. The story you're going to tell is of your outsider position, so you're going to tell me a story about how you were talking to your partner, his or her daughter came in, your partner allowed that child to interrupt you and didn't discipline the kid, and I'm your therapist, I'm a compassionate and empathic person, what am I going to say? ‘That’s terrible.’ Dads, weekend dads, they’re wimps. And then the next time you go back and get left out again, is your heart going to be more open? I don't think so, so it’s a real challenge, because you're listening as a therapist to hold your compassion for all the players in the system, and the worse things are, the more likely that you are only going to hear one story. You know, I might hear from the parent, the parent’s story is, ‘You know, my kid came in from school crying, and my wife was upset that I comforted her.’ Now, what a reactive idiot, right? So, as an individual therapist, really important to empathize without being demonizing, so empathize with the feeling, it’s really tough to be left out over and over again. 

00:32:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:10
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Really hard, and then once I feel like I’ve got a resonating connection with you, then I can say, ‘And these families, you're in a stuck position, and your partner is in a stuck position, it’s tough for both of you,’ but I want to leave the door open for connection rather than slam it, and it’s so easy. You know, we just like to empathize it feels good to us. 

00:32:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:40
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Oh, what an idiot. You don’t want to, you really want to watch that with these families, they’re already fragile. 

00:32:45
RICH SIMON So, part of it, as you were saying a moment ago, is these maps, and then partly there’s this other level where you’re focusing on what you're calling the skills. Another piece, so talk to us about that, and how do you go from this first stage, that initial focus to moving into looking at skills, and what are these relevant skills? 

00:33:10
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, a couple things. One is that, I’ll give a piece of psychoeducation, ask people what it was like to hear and have them turn to each other, and then what I'm really going to have them do is slow way down. I'm going to watch for a while. If things are going well, one will say, ‘Gee I feel left out,’ and the other will say, ‘Poor poopsie.’ I don't really see that very often in my office. Actually, every now and then, I get a couple who are basically in good shape, who just need a little education, and I get to tell them what to do, and then they go away. It’s great. 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON That’s right. 

00:33:45
PATRICIA PAPERNOW But that’s not usually how it goes. So I do a couple of things. One is something really, it sounds very simple, I call it joining. It’s sort of a little (inaudible ), I think. Very simple, but alot happens on the nonverbal level, and that is when people start to tangle, I put up a time out sign, and I say, ‘Can I help you? This isn’t going too well. I want to teach you something really simple that will help you make the connection,’ because I’ve already explored with them that this kind of a family puts parents and step parents in totally different positions, so you're trying to have a conversation, but you're not seeing the same thing. That's harder. It’s alot easier if we’re standing shoulder to shoulder and we’re seeing the same thing. It’s easier, right? So I want to help you see, help you have a conversation about a difference, and here’s what I want you to do. First, who wants to start? Okay, Rich, you want to start. Sentence or two? And if they’re particularly nasty fighter, I might say, ‘I’d like it to be an I statement.’ Simple stuff we learned long ago, but really important. I’d like it to be an I statement, so Rich, could you make a sentence or two an I statement. I’m having alot of trouble with your kid leaving a mess. Great. Alright, person B, your turn. Before you respond, I would like you to take a breath, I would like you to remember that you love this person, I would like you to find a place in your heart where you love them, you wouldn't be here otherwise, and notice I’m slowing my voice and slowing my pace, because I'm wanting to slow the heart rate down a little bit as I speak. Sue Johnson is so wonderful with her low and slow, if people’s heart rate is high, and you’re there chattering away, you're not going to make a connection. So before you respond, I would like you to tell Rich what you do understand about what he just said, what you do understand. Now, I’m going to repeat myself several times until the person looks like they’ve slowed a little bit. ‘Well, he just said da da da da.’ Great, you got it right, now, here’s what I want you to do. I want you to take a breath, turn to Rich, and I think you just landed that on his left toe, would you land that on his heart? Rich, I heard you say da da da da, is that right, Rich? Yeah, simple, but very, very, very, very slow, and about round three or four, if I’ve stayed, and you have to have a firm hand, I mean big heart, but a firm hand, about round three or four there’s going to start to be a sense of connection, and then I can say, ‘Can you see, guys, that you're starting to feel connected to each other? It is not from feeling the same way. Rich still feels,’ I forget if I made you a parent or step parent, I’ll make you a step parent, ‘Rich still feels the kid’s mess is intolerable, and you still think it’s okay, and you're connected.’ So that’s joining. I use that in my office alot to keep things from going wild and wooly. People cannot always do it at home, but what they can do at home is something I call soft hard soft. Operationalize John Galtman’s soft start up. How do you start to talk about something hard in a way that your partner can hear you? Because you may be right that these kids are slobs, and by the way, these skills are as important with individuals as with couples. So stepmom comes in and she says, ‘He doesn’t discipline his kids at all, and I try to tell him about it, and he just gets defensive.’ Now, how easy is it for the therapist to say, ‘Oh that’s terrible.’ But really what I'm going to ask is how do you tell him? ‘Oh, I tell him his kids are slobs. It’s the truth, isn’t it?’ Well, it turns out people don't like being criticized, and parents are really sensitive, really sensitive about their parenting and their kids. So I would probably say to her, ‘I'm sure that you would rather he listen, can I help you? Can I teach you how to say it to him so that he might get it?’ And oftentimes what I get back is ‘Why do I have to be so careful?’ and it’s a good question, and I usually say, ‘It would be nice if we didn’t have to be, wouldn’t it? It would be so much easier to say what you want to say,’ but as one of my mentors said ‘We’re made out of toothpicks and tissue paper.’ So it turns out people don’t like to hear criticism, but the choice is not shut your mouth or blurt, so here’s what I want to teach you. It’s called soft hard soft, it’s kind of a reverse Oreo cookie. Start with something soft, so take a minute, think of something hard you want to say, and now look for a soft. Now soft could be I care about you, it could be positive feedback, I know you're working with your kids to get them to clean up. It could be empathy, I know it’s really hard to make a limit with your ex spouse. Oh, we haven't talked about ex spouse, Rich, we have to talk about ex spouses. 

00:39:30
RICH SIMON We’ll get to them. 

00:39:30
PATRICIA PAPERNOW And, it could be, it’s very helpful to say to, to get your intention. You wouldn’t intent me to feel like a lump on a log. Those are soft. Find a couple of softs, and with that same soft energy, then first say the soft, and then with that same soft energy, say the hard and add another soft, and then I’ll make people practice. Find a soft, you want to tell him that his kids are slobs. Okay, find a soft, find two softs. Try the soft, the hard, and the soft. So that's soft hard soft. 

00:40:15
RICH SIMON Alright- 

00:40:15
PATRICIA PAPERNOW (crosstalk)Pretty concrete. most people can do that one. 

00:40:15
RICH SIMON And so, and then the, where do the, in terms of kid in the session with you, so you've already indicated you're by training a couples therapist, you often try to work with the different subsystems with the family. Under what circumstances would you have the child in the session with the step parents, the biological parent and the step parent or with either parent? 

00:40:45
PATRICIA PAPERNOW You know, I would usually start with the parent and the kid, and especially if the kids are having trouble, oftentimes the parents aren’t getting it, so if the kid is having trouble, I would be likely to meet individually with the kid and with the parent, just to get a sense of what’s happening. I want to help the kid articulate when they don't have language. We often have to guess about losses and loyalty lines. Parents don't say, ‘My child is feeling a sense of loss.’ What they will say is, ‘My kid is not behaving well.’ So kids often don’t have language for what’s happened, and it’s very, very helpful to give kids language, even the language loyalty sign. I interviewed a 32 year old stepkip, and I said that’s called a loyalty sign, and they said, ‘Really? I just thought I was a hateful child. I was always angry at my stepparent.’ And then I meet with the parents and try to talk a little bit about some of the things we've just talked about. About how parents and kids feel really differently, and I'm pretty gentle, careful about that, because it’s not easy to hear. You know, I often say if kids and parents have a really different experience as a stepfamily, if you can understand it, it will be helpful, but it may be painful to hear. That you are thrilled, but your kid’s not, and can I help you understand, and then I often will meet with the parent and the child and the first thing is I want to help parents attune. One of the first things kids need, we know this neurologically from Dan Segal’s work, all the wonderful interpersonal neurobiology that what helps kids is a sense that parents get their story, that parents get their feelings. It’s very hard for parents, the kid says, ‘I hate my step parent.’ What does the parent say? ‘She’s a nice person.’ or if they’re even worse, ‘You didn’t mean that.’ or, ‘I don't ever want to hear you say that.’ And I actually use the joining thing with parents. Take a breath, I know you love your child, can you find a place where you do understand what Johnny just said? Johnny just said this is hard. It’s hard for you to hear, can you give yourself a hug and take a breath and let Johnny know what you do understand. Johnny, do you get it? I do alot of that with parents and kids. I don't meet with the couple and the kid too often, unless things are really pretty solid. 

00:43:20
RICH SIMON So go back for a moment. The sound of this I find so useful, to hear your voice, and I really feel like I'm in the session with you as you're giving us these scenarios. So with the kids, I have a very clear sense of this very lovely way you have of warming things of up with the family and giving people this sense of being understood and then moving them towards things that may be difficult, more difficult for them to hear. So how does it sound with kids, so depending on the age of the kid, like let’s talk about the preteen girl client, for example, that you had mentioned earlier. Those are the ones who, often with the single mother, who have particular difficulty in stepfamilies. How do you begin a conversation with kids who may be feeling angry and having alot of trouble with this new family constellation? 

00:44:10
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, I think it’s again important to remember that there’s a compassion trap here. And especially for kid therapists, it is very hard. I look really hard for kid therapists who also hold their compassion for adults, because when you hear a kid say, ‘My stepfather doesn't let me sit next to my mother.’ Now, what’s the stepfather’s story? The stepfather’s story is I was sitting next to my partner, and her kid came and sat between us or interrupted us. So that’s the first thing. As the kid therapist to really hold onto the step parent as outsider status and how hard that is, and the parent is often torn. Torn between taking care of your kid and taking care of your partner, and then, can you hold your empathy for the kid without demonizing either or any of the others? That’s really tough. New stepfamilies are hard for people. Did you know that? Did you know it’s not just you? Sometimes that’s helpful to kids, and lots of time the grownups are really thrilled, and it’s really hard for the kids. It’s like you had a mom, and now you have a lovesick teenager, is that right? Yeah. So the first thing I'm going to do is make an empathic connection with the kid. Try not to demonize. Oftentimes what I’ll hear is about a step parent who is too harsh, has stepped in with discipline too quickly, and the parent, you know, the parent has a new relationship, they don't want to, it’s hard to know what to do. And again, I often think with kids, it’s harder with adolescents. The grownups are really important piece, so I will often, I don't work with kids alot, but when I do, and when I supervise people who work with kids, could we talk to the grownups about this? How would it be for you if I talked to the grownups about this? They won’t listen. Well, it might be kind of hard for them to listen, but I’d be willing to try. Let’s talk about what you want me to talk about and what you don't want me to talk about. Oftentimes the adults need some education about what’s going on. Kids really need somebody who gets it and so how do you be the person who gets it without trashing anybody? The other piece that we haven’t talked about is there are slightly lower outcomes, less good outcomes for kids in stepfamilies than first time families, however, the difference is not the structure, it’s process, and the two things are parenting, which we’ve been talking about, authoritative, warm and firm parenting, and no authoritarian parenting by the step parent, and the other thing that’s critical is conflict. The level of conflict, and it, ex spouse conflict and adult step couple conflict. Kids do much more poorly when there’s conflict, so one of the things that I teach all of my supervisees is this almost a public health issue. If you hear an adult say we had a fight, or I had a fight with my ex, I always ask were the children there? Did the kids overhear? Oh, it didn’t matter. You know, they’ve done some really interesting experiments where they’ve hooked kids up with stuff to see what their heart rate is, and you show a picture of the adults in conflict, and the kid looks fine, but then you look at the heart rate, very hard for kids. Even moderate tension turns out to be very, very difficult for kids, so one of the things I'm always monitoring is what’s the level of conflict and really helping adults understand that in very easy to fight in front of kids, it’s sometimes hard to stop fighting in front of kids, and for people who really don't get it, if they really haven't gotten it, one of the things I sometimes say is this is harsh, this’ll be hard to hear, I know you love your kids, here’s what conflict is like for a child. It’s like putting sulfuric acid in your kid’s system. I know that’s not what you want. Let’s talk about how you can stop it. 

00:48:50
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:48:55
PATRICIA PAPERNOW So just to change the subject here from kids. 

00:49:00
RICH SIMON That will definitely get people’s attention. 

00:49:05
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Sometimes people can’t do it, and then, I've had a bunch of guys, it’s very interesting, gasp, very triggered by their ex spouses, and again, this is another time where the dad says, ‘My kid has asthma, my ex wife smokes, the kid comes back reeking of smoke, we end up in the ER, we’ve called the Department of Children Services, but there’s nothing much is changing. I talk to my ex wife about this, and she hangs up on me.’ Well, what does an empathic therapist say, ‘Oh, that’s terrible,’ but as the guy’s talking to me the pace of his speech is very fast, and it gets faster and faster as he gets madder, and I’m wondering how overwhelming he is when he’s talking to his ex, and so, again, I’m going to start with psychoeducation and skills, you know. Can we talk about how you could be strategic with your ex? What do you end up saying to her, well, it turns out he’s criticizes her up down and sideways. Tells her that she’s a horrible mother, and she hangs up on him. How surprising. And then I found out some more, and I found out the ex wife prevented strategically, I have to learn some things about her, tell me about her, what was school like for her? School was terrible for her, this is a real case, turns out she has auditory processing issues, she doesn't process language well, she has two older sisters who were brilliant, she was picked on, and there is her ex husband talking a mile a minute and telling her she’s really bad. She hangs up, so I say to him, ‘Can I help you be more strategic? This so a woman that is going to need you to go a sentence at a time, let me teach you about soft hard soft.’ 

00:50:55
RICH SIMON Soft hard soft, yeah. 

00:50:55
PATRICIA PAPERNOW You know, it’s hard not to smoke, I get it. He gets the idea, he can do it for one and a half sentences, and then he blows. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:05
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Now, three or four cases like this, these guys were willing to do their own internal work, and in every case, the wife, the second wife said, ‘I can’t stand it. You are off the wall. You talk to your ex wife and we’re all miserable.’ I want you to do some work on this, and every single case, these guys had their own trauma histories. They had, I work in the internal family system model, it’s a really, really nice model for this. I can see what happens inside you when you talk to your wife, your ex wife, and it’s one of the things therapists need to learn to begin asking when somebody is triggered, and the other person’s behavior sounds terrible, we still want to know what’s happening inside you when your ex wife doesn't get it? What happened inside of you? And we did some wonderful work, all three of these guys, three or four of them, with their own, the guy I'm thinking of now has a 16 year old living in a box. His parents were alcoholic, and nobody knew, nobody knew, and so when his ex wife doesn't parent well, it’s incredibly triggering to him. Now, he’s absolutely right, you don’t smoke in front of the kid with asthma, however, until he could calm himself down enough to be strategic, he could not be effective, and once he had done some of his internal work, all of a sudden, he says, ‘I did it, Patricia, I went slow, I just said a sentence or two, I was so positive, and Patricia, she listened! She listened, she didn’t hang up!’ So those are fun cases, when you can do the work, you know, the internal work and untangle enough so people can be much more strategic and effective. 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON So that was what you were saying when you introduced all this, about these old bruises, that you don't go there prematurely, you move through these other levels, and then when you find that things aren't quite working as you might hope or expect, then you’ll, at that point focus on- 

00:53:25
PATRICIA PAPERNOW (crosstalk)We did that. The thing I talk about is a looping, looping, looping feeling, we have been over this before. A widowed dad says, ‘Why isn't my young adult daughter thrilled for me?’ I go through psychoed, we do it three or four times, and he comes back and says, ‘Why isn't she thrilled for me?’ Same with skills. It’s just like the guy I just talked about. He gets it in his head, but he can’t do it. So when skills don't stick, psychoed doesn't stick, you’ve tried a few times, and you find yourself, I have that straining feeling like I'm trying to do this, it just won’t go. That’s the clue to start turning inside, and some people won’t go inside. 

00:54:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, do you ever have in these we’re thinking here in the old fashioned family systems model, invite everybody into the session, so do you under some circumstances might you have an ex spouse come into the session with you? 

00:54:25
PATRICIA PAPERNOW I would certainly have ex spouses come into the other, but without kids. We don't want to expose kids to conflict. So if you have ex spouses who are in conflict, we don't want to expose kids to conflict. I have met with two couples, two step couples, the four of them. Dad and his new partner, mom and her new partner, and I use that joining thing, I go way slow, I keep a really firm hand, and I think if you have a capacity to do that, it can be incredibly helpful. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON And what would be the circumstances under which you might have such a well populated consulting room? 

00:55:10
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Alot of bravery on the part of the therapist. 

00:55:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Alright, that's characteristic. 

00:55:20
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Conflict over a couple of different things. Let’s see. Let me think of a particular, you know when there’s conflict between the exes, one of the things that I want everybody to get is that I understand the conflict, I understand you don't like each other, which is why you're divorced, and we've got to protect the kids. We must protect the kids from conflict. I can tell you some of the research. What can we do together to make sure kids are not caught in the middle? Can we give you some ways to communicate? Texting is fabulous for stepfamilies, because you can't say too much, here’s how you can communicate, you can use what the information that you each need. Texting’s also great for step parents and kids, because kids answer texts. 

00:56:20
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:56:20
PATRICIA PAPERNOW So what else do I have? I sometimes have a new couple that wants to, I call it circle the wagons, that they really want to make their own new family, and they're pulling the kid and extruding the other parent. Those are hard cases, because there’s often alot going on there. Sometimes some psychoeducation is enough, lots of times those are pretty long term, difficult, crazy cases. 

00:56:50
RICH SIMON Okay, so we’re, this is great, what a very vivid map. I’ll remember sulfuric acid, last with me for a long time to come, if you want to get people’s attention, get some- 

00:57:05
PATRICIA PAPERNOW (crosstalk)That’s to be said kindly. Very kindly. 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)I think you’ve demonstrated how you can say very difficult things in that soft voice of yours and really get through. So, it’s in the time we have, so if people are interested in finding out more about this way of working, more about your work, more about training resources for working with stepfamilies, where can they go? 

00:57:35
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Well, they can look for my book, which should I survive the process will be finished at the end of this year, Surviving and Thriving in Stepfamily Relationships, Rutledge. 

00:57:45
RICH SIMON In 2012, Rutledge, okay. 

00:57:50
PATRICIA PAPERNOW Yeah, and you know I don't have a website. It’s terrible, but I do alot of training, I come to the Networker every year, and do workshop, and I'm glad to do supervision on the phone, I'm glad, I cannot take another client, but I'm glad to Skype with people, do group supervision on the phone, and to help people do this work. It’s such important work, and there is no way that a few experts like me can possibly meet the needs. One out of two of us will be in a step relationship at some point in our lives. 

00:58:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So we’ll have to people, well maybe this leads us into the comment board, so those of you who have been listening to Patricia talk about her stepfamilies and her way of working with them, there’s a comment board on your screen. We’re very interested in having this, as always, having the conversation continue, so if you, whatever it is that stood out for you, that you learned, you had questions, if you have some inquiry about supervision, whatever it is, go up to the comment board, of which we will make Patricia aware and of this session and when there are comments, as the spirit moves her she may respond, but she has agreed to look at what occurs on the comment board, so that will be a way to communicate with her, so Patricia, this just really, just, you've communicated such an immediate sense of what it would be like, I feel like I've had an intervention with you as a long term step parent, all the things I wish I had known when I got into this process. Thank you so much, and thank you for the gift of your presence, it’s just really lovely to hear you describe your work. So that’s it from the Networker and our webcast from this afternoon, see you next time. Bye Bye.
