00:00:15
With Jon Carlson Psy. D., Ed. D. 

00:00:15
Pat Love, Ed. D. 

00:01:00
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson- 

00:01:00
PAT LOVE And I'm Pat love- 

00:01:05
JON CARLSON Welcome to 'Living Love.' In today's section- 

00:01:05
PAT LOVE Conscious communication. 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON We're gonna begin with a quiz that our audience is gonna get a chance to take- 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE I think it's only fair they take it, because when I took it, I didn't do that well, I don't know you. 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON Nor did I, and that's why I really look forward to the second part when we get a chance to have a discussion Harville Hendrix. He's gonna let us know about conscious communication. 

00:01:25
PAT LOVE And we're going to learn skills, we're going to learn literally how to consciously communicate, and we're going to have real couples with real issues to show that. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON And we can watch them, and then we can practice at home. 

00:01:35
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:01:35
JON CARLSON Great. 

00:01:35
Conscious Communication 

00:01:40
[sil.] 

00:01:40
featuring Harville Hendrix, Ph.D. 

00:01:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Exactly. It's like any skill. Riding a two-person bicycle, and riding it elegantly. And in fact, being an instance of unconscious communication. 

00:01:50
Living Love 1. I am known for my clear communication? True False 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Now it's time for you to test your knowledge of conscious communications, along with our studio couples. We have a 10 item quiz, get your pencils and paper ready, here's the first question: One, I'm known for my clear communication. 

00:02:15
PAT LOVE I have to say, so many of the difficulties I get in myself is when I'm not clear. It's like it's clear in my head, but somehow it doesn't get communicated to my partner. Or I make up what I think he means. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Ah, yeah. 

00:02:25
PAT LOVE I make up stuff. You know- 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Or she should know that. We've been together a long time. 

00:02:30
PAT LOVE Exactly, I, I mind read. I don't know if anyone else does that. Uh, true or false, two, I make a conscious effort to communicate clearly with my partner. 

00:02:40
Living Love 2. I make a conscious effort to communicate clearly with my partner. True False 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Um, I can go on and on and I know exactly what I'm saying, and I understand it. And then he will say, 'Wait, wait, wait,' and he'll throw me all off, you know, and then he'll want me to say it how he can understand it, and I still don't know how to do it. Because it's the way I know how to do it, and he has his way, and so he wants me to communicate it his way. You know, it's, it's really, it's really hard, and it's kinda, gets me angry and frustrated. 

00:03:10
Living Love 3. I pay close attention when my partner is communicating with me? True False 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON And often I'm on the wrong problem, 'member my wife saying to me, she's saying, you know, 'The kids are driving me nuts, I just gotta get outta here,' and I'm sayin' 'Well call a sitter,' and she says ' There are no sitters,' and I say, you know, 'We can find you a sitter, I know one, let me call one, let's get a sitter in here,' and, and, she just said, 'No, I know we can't get a sitter.' And I said, it seems to me you're upset about somethin' else,' and she said, 'Yeah, it's you, you should be home with the kids, not me.' Ooh, home run. Number three, I pay close attention when my partner is communicating with me. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN It goes in one ear, right through the other one. 

00:03:50
PAT LOVE Ooh! It's clear all right, it's clear in this ear, clear out the other- 

00:03:50
JON CARLSON Clear it's-, it's transparent. Yeah. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Yeah I just sit there nodding, 'Yes, I heard you, okay, I'm ready.' 

00:03:55
PAT LOVE What, what I realize, that when I don't hear, it's usually like I'm watchin' a movie in my own head. It's like, I, I'm really-, it is, it's like I'm watching this whole movie in my head, and, and my partner isn't in the movie. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, we find ourselves once in a wh-, once in a while, we get caught, and we're lying in bed, we'll start bringing up some problems that we're having, and, it's definitely not the place to start penting up some, uh, frustrations while you're lying in bed with your, uh, spouse. So, we have two kids, and it's definitely hard to find time to actually share feelings, and, to work on things that you need to work on. 

00:04:35
Living Love 4. I make a conscious effort to understand my partner's point of view when we differ. True False 

00:04:40
PAT LOVE The next one. I make a conscious effort to understand my partner's point of view when we differ. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN I, first reaction normally is, he doesn't get my point of view. 

00:04:55
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. Yes. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN You know it's that old sayin', the best defense is a good offense. 

00:05:00
Living Love 5. I can readily admit when I'm wrong. True False 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON Number five, I can readily admit when I'm wrong. 

00:05:05
PAT LOVE (inaudible ) 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN I never like to admit when I'm wrong. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN I can agree. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON Maybe it's a male thing, huh? 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN It is. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON It's a male thing? Got some support for that. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN I was gonna say I never applied, that, uh, I can readily admit when I'm wrong, but it doesn't happen very often. 

00:05:25
JON CARLSON Oh! You thought you made a mistake, but you were wrong, huh? 

00:05:30
PAT LOVE I can remember the first time, saying, when I said, 'You were right, and I was wrong.' It's like the word stuck in my throat. I had to practice it, almost like rehearse it. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON Yeah, aren't those the three words that are the, the more powerful than, uh, 'I love you'? 

00:05:45
PAT LOVE You are, yes, you right, and I was wrong. I share my feelings openly with my partner. 

00:05:55
Living Love 6. I share my feelings openly with my partner True False 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN That's a yes for sure. 

00:06:00
PAT LOVE That's a- 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN I share, uh, anger, frustration, and uh, resentments, openly. 

00:06:05
PAT LOVE Openly! Openly. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Ever got the feeling that the garage door needs to get fixed, and this needs to get fixed, sometimes when I ask for feelings and stuff, I get things that need to be done. You know. There seems to be- 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Diversion. A diversion. 

00:06:20
[sil.] 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN I'm 180 degrees. I clam up, I shut up, and I go out to the garage, or go out in the yard and cut the grass or somethin'. And I hold everything in, I don't share my feelings. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Sometimes it's hard to know what your feelings are. I mean, it's like, like you were saying sometimes you have to take a break, and I, come out and say, you know, 'Okay, I figured out what my feelings are, I'm hurt, scared, embarrassed, so here's my list, let's talk about it, so it takes some time to sorta sit with yourself and ask yourself, hey, what am I feeling?' 

00:06:50
Living Love 7. I am respectful with my partner's feelings. True False 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON Number seven is I'm respectful of my partner's feelings. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN I, I think for both of us, we work very hard on doing that, but it's so hard for me when, when, my partner is sharing her frustrations, and how she's angry with things, and, you know, I just, sometimes I just wanna make her feel better right away, and I know that's, when I do that, that's not being very respectful. Allowing her to be, to feel how she feels. 

00:07:25
[sil.] 

00:07:25
Living Love 8. I make a habit of stating my needs kindly. True False 

00:07:25
PAT LOVE Number eight, I make a habit of stating my needs kindly. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN No, because, I do like what you say, I, I expected him to mind-read and when he didn't get it, and he didn't read my mind, it's like, now I'm angry. I don't, you know, you should have known I have those needs. 

00:07:45
PAT LOVE And I have to tell you, I lived several decades before I was even clear about my own needs. I somehow expected my partner to know what I didn't know. I almost expected him to know something I didn't know about myself. 

00:08:00
Living Love 9. I am very clear and specific with my partner about my needs True False 

00:08:05
JON CARLSON Number nine, I am very clear and specific with my partner about my needs. 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN And she'll say, 'She said this, and then she said that, meaning it's two different people, but I don't know that.' 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. My pronoun, you know I tend to, to be, uh, I'm not specific. And so, she and a he, and then, he's like 'Whose he, and whose she?' 

00:08:25
Living Love 10. I am comfortable making requests of my partner True False 

00:08:30
PAT LOVE And the last one, I am comfortable making requests of my partner. I tell ya what was a breakthrough for me, one time I was taking care of a friend of mine in the hospital. And people kept coming in and saying, oh, you're such an angel, you're such an angel, taking care of her. And, I was incredulous, because I was getting such pleasure out of taking care of her, I really, I said, it's a privilege to take care of her. And, all of a sudden I had one of those TMM's. Temporary moment of maturity. You know. Where I got it. How I had robbed other people of the privilege. Of taking care of me. 

00:09:15
JON CARLSON You know what? I think we're all in the same boat. 

00:09:20
PAT LOVE I feel better. A little bit better because, uh, I was feeling miserable and misery does love company. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON I think we need to, to uh, talk to Harville Hendrix and, uh, find out, just how to do this conscious communication and improve on our answers. 

00:09:35
PAT LOVE Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON Let's welcome our guest, Harville Hendrix, and learn some more about conscious communication. 

00:09:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Thank you very much. 

00:09:45
JON CARLSON Why don't we start with a easy question. 

00:09:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. 

00:09:50
JON CARLSON What is conscious communication? 

00:09:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well, it's when you know what you're talkin' about. And you think about it ahead of time, and say what you mean to say, rather than finding yourself having said something you didn't mean. 

00:10:00
PAT LOVE That's why I get in trouble. I don't always know what I'm talking about. Literally, and I don't mean I'm not familiar with the subject, but you're right, when I think of the times I've gotten in trouble, I'm really not thinking about what I'm saying, or I'm not even aware of it, is that what you mean? 

00:10:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well it, it has another element, too, I call it intention. You, you have an intention for people to understand what you're saying, to get it. So they don't have to ask you questions. Or wonder what you mean. You're not being vague or defensive, or uh, elusive. You are being clear, you're being direct, you're being simple. Um, and people get what you're saying. But you also have an outcome that you want. You really want to, uh, relate to this person in some way, or communicate to them something. So, y-, there's an element of intention about it. You're conscious that you have this intention. Then you talk in such a way that what you want to get over, gets over. 

00:10:55
JON CARLSON Can you really be that conscious? Can you really be that aware, all the time? 

00:11:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Not all the time. Uh, I think none of us are that aware all the time. Uh, but, it is possible to be that aware some of the time. It's, um, possible also to become more and more and more aware, so that after a while you find there's a self-regulating, or self-satisfying feedback group. You're clear, you get over what you want, the world works better for you, so it becomes not only an enjoyable habit, but-, or an addictive habit, but a new way of life. 

00:11:30
PAT LOVE I would think- 

00:11:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX It can be that way. 

00:11:30
PAT LOVE Uh, after a time, I mean I would think in the beginning, I would have to be conscious, or think about it, and intentional, but then, it sounds like, over time, it would even take less energy. There would be fewer problems between the two of us if I communicated clearly, and you got it the first time. 

00:11:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Exactly, it's like any skill. When you start off with a skill, like in skiing, or the skill of meditating, you have to do it mechanically, you have to put in a lot of effort, you will do it wrong, and you try again, and after a while, you begin to get this feedback from the success, and your brain integrates it, you begin to feel, uh, connected to people, they like talking to you, they feel like you really are there when you talk, and so then the skill moves to a level of natural-ness and elegance and, then you're that kind of person. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON You're not born that way, you actually can learn- 

00:12:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX No, you're not born that way. 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON What does your earlier experiences have to do with this, and how we can communicate as adults? 

00:12:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well, early experiences are sources of models about how to communicate. You watch how your parents communicate, and not necessarily consciously noticing them, but you're around them, you absorb the way they communicate, you see what works for them, and what doesn't work for them, and unconsciously you internalize it, and replicate, reproduce in your relationship with other people the models of communication that you saw. That's one thing, is internalizing. The second thing is, that you also learn how it's possible to communicate around your parents. What is not possible to communicate. What part of yourself you can, uh, express, what part you can't. So not only do you model how to communicate from them, which you also learn, how you can communicate with them, and then, and b-, because everything that you're doing with your parents has to do with your survival, it has to do with your sense of safety, so you notice what happens that keeps me safe, what happens that urges my survival. Kids are not processing it, not thinkin' about it, but it's happening, and then you behave in such a way, and you communicate in such a way that you keep yourself safe and alive. 

00:13:35
PAT LOVE You know, at one point, I can remember having, uh, embarrassment, or um, shame associated with not knowing how to communicate effectively. Is that normal, to feel uncomfortable? I mean it seems like I oughta know how to do this. It's embarrassing when I, someone I love so much, that I can't somehow say what I wanna say, and, and it feels embarrassing. 

00:14:00
Harville Hendrix, Ph.D. 

00:14:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX It it, it's embarrassing when you experience yourself, if I'm hearing you right, not making the connection on communicating what you wanna know. And here's where the childhood stuff is chipped in, you've either have a model you're operating out of, which doesn't work in this particular situation, or there's an unconscious model about, uh, I don't know how to function here so that I can stay safe. And, in any case, when you-, when you're working out a dysfunctional models, or ineffective models, and a defense, or fear defense, uh, but you wanna communicate something, and those things are interfering, it does feel awkward, embarrassing, and you say, 'God I wish I could really say what I think, wish I could really say what I feel.' 

00:14:35
PAT LOVE Right, I look back on those times I think why didn't I say 'Why didn't I say that,' or 'Why didn't I say this?' But on the other side of this, the times when I feel closest to my partner or my children, or whomever, is when I'm really, really, heard. I mean- 

00:14:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX When you're heard. 

00:14:55
PAT LOVE My whole body, my whole body, I feel it insi-, I mean, I feel it in my body. It really does, I just relax, uh, it brings tears to my eyes. I mean it moves me so much when we are, it's almost like there's no blockage between us, there's a clarity, there's an energy, we're each feeling one another's energy. That's a peak moment. 

00:15:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Like two people riding a two-person bicycle. 

00:15:15
PAT LOVE Exactly. 

00:15:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And riding it elegantly. 

00:15:20
JON CARLSON I've heard you say that, that problems are actually a rupture of connection, and this is just the opposite of that. That's, y-, she really feels connected, and there are no problems. She feels heard. 

00:15:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, yes. And when you are feeling heard, you feel that flow back and forth, like two people on a bicycle. You do feel it organically. You feel it. You feel like things are all right with the world. And then when something happens, and a fear comes up, and you become defensive, and you say a self-protective thing, you rupture that. That's when you feel bad. Cause the, the rupture of connection is probably the most painful experience a child, or an adult can have. You know, we used to think there are only-, only children grow. And, uh, only children need to have supportive context. And now we know that adults grow, and that adults need supportive connectional context throughout their life. That attachment and connection is important for them. So whenever that occurs, the rupture occurs, is one of the most painful experiences there is. 

00:16:25
PAT LOVE For me, I know one thing that, that really helps, and this is important, it's like being heard is helping. 

00:16:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

00:16:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Oftentimes, my husband-, I know, he feels like he has to do something, and, and I, and I-, it took me a long time to help him to know, I just had to say time and again, when you listen, and you really hear me, that is helping- 

00:16:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

00:16:45
PAT LOVE And it's loving, it feels so loving. 

00:16:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Right. 

00:16:50
JON CARLSON Well I bet there are some of our viewers are, are watching and listening and saying, 'I'm a conscious communicator, but my partner isn't.' 

00:16:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. 

00:17:00
JON CARLSON 'How do I get them to be as conscious as I am?' 

00:17:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well I, I have a very short answer to that. Uh, be the best model you can, and they'll get it. 

00:17:10
JON CARLSON You mean I shouldn't criticize, or complain or point out their flaws? 

00:17:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well not if you want a different outcome. If you want your partners communication skills to decrease, uh, then tell them how awful they are as communicators. If you want them to increase, then appreciate the fact that they are there, and that they're trying to connect. And whenever they do anything that is connectional, anything right, say 'Wow!' In other words, be a model. Rather than a critic. It's amazing how fast and rapidly your partner would be willing to grow. 'Cause they don't really want to be disconnected from you, and they don't like this feeling of shame when they can't communicate what they want. And, but most partners don't have models. And the other thing I say is that the partner who says, 'I'm a conscious communicator, but I'm connected to somebody who's not a conscious communicator,' is in a self-delusion about the fact that they are a conscious communicator. Conscious communicators tend to produce growth and evolution and um, and connection in their environment. 

00:18:10
PAT LOVE Is it fair to say that even making the criticism, or even blaming your partner for not being a conscious communicator, or even a communicator, is a disconnecting activi-, eh, would that be one of the ruptures you were talking about earlier? 

00:18:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX That would be a rupture, and in fact, be an instance of being an unconscious communicator. That is, if I am criticizing you for being a poor communicator, then I clearly, uh, for not being a conscious communicator, I clearly am unconscious, an unconscious communicator, and I'm doing something that's going to sabotage what I really wanna connect with you, so. 

00:18:45
PAT LOVE Because if I were conscious, I would know that statement is gonna be disconnecting, not connecting. 

00:18:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Exactly. 

00:18:50
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:18:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Exactly. 

00:18:50
JON CARLSON Well what are the skills? What are this, these key skills that one needs to have to be a conscious communicator? 

00:18:55
Harville Hendrix, Ph.D. 

00:19:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well I, I think that the, the key skill is in being a conscious communicator something I call dialogue. 

00:19:05
JON CARLSON 'K. 

00:19:05
Conscious Communication 

00:19:05
Mirroring establish Contact Validation establish Connection Empathy establish Communion 

00:19:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that dialogue is a process of conscious connection, uh, which is broken down into three different parts. And those parts are mirroring, validation, and empathy. And they each are very specific, they can be demonstrated, they can be learned. Everybody can, it's not complicated at all, everybody can do this. And that once you do it, it's a skill, then it becomes integrated as a part of your life, and then you live, you live essentially in a different world. We call it, you live a dialogical existence. 

00:19:40
PAT LOVE So you're sorta living in connection. Now can we be connected when we're not physically connected? That's what I would like to know. 

00:19:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Oh, absolutely, the, the physical connection is, um, grounding experience, you know, sight, and touch and so forth, but connection is something that includes that, but also includes the sense of the presence of the other when they're absent. 

00:20:00
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:20:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Uh, the present in your memory, in your mind, in your heart, when they're far away. 

00:20:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:20:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And, they are present when you don't like them. When something has gone wrong, uh, there's a, a, uh, o-, an willingness to disconnect, even though there's been a disagreement. Or a disappointment. So that connection is, uh, not only a psycho-physical, but I think connection is, has spiritual qualities to it. That it's a larger thing. 

00:20:30
PAT LOVE I think my communication skills, and, and, proving and becoming what you're calling more conscious, has really helped me to feel connected to my partner, when he's not here, or when I'm on the road. Or when he's traveling, so forth, and that is such a secure feeling, and such a warm feeling, I love that about relationships. 

00:20:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Like you carry him inside you- 

00:20:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:20:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Somehow in your mind and heart while you're away. And then when you do reach him on the phone, my guess is there's a real energy- 

00:20:55
PAT LOVE Right. 

00:20:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX On the phone of connection, it's almost as though distance is not there, and time is not there. 

00:21:00
PAT LOVE Right, but it's funny, we can right sitting next to one another, and feel disconnected. 

00:21:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And totally out of connection, yes. 

00:21:05
PAT LOVE Not conscious. Gotta think about making- 

00:21:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX But that's a helpful thing to, I think to say, is that connection could look like, you know, something that's physically connected, and that that's only an indication, or one point of connection, that connection itself has to do with an almost undefinable quality of one-ness within which you're also two, but you're also one. And that there's a flow of energy, and that flow of energy is, while I'm with you, it's while I'm away from you, it's in my mind and heart. And somehow when I'm connected, I feel like I'm connected to something much bigger than I am, much bigger than us, it's sort of like that's the, that's what it's all about. That's what the essence of life is, is to experience that. 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON This communication's so powerful because it, it, defies, uh, physical limit. It sounds like- 

00:21:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. It defies physical limits. 

00:21:55
JON CARLSON We can be far apart and close together or close together and far apart. 

00:22:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX The thing I liked about what you just said, it made me relax, is I can be separate. 

00:22:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX I can be separate, yes. 

00:22:05
PAT LOVE You know, there's something about connection that I have to say, you know, makes me, I wanna make sure that I'm still a separate person. I don't have to be you, or think like you, or. And I can still be separate. 

00:22:15
Harville Hendrix, Ph.D. 

00:22:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Well I, I think in conscious connection, that's really one of the indicators of it. Is that I can be fully me, and I can be connected to you. And remain me. 

00:22:30
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:22:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And, that's what connection is, it's two different people who are separate, who have their own unique characteristics, in relationship. So that, that neither one loses themselves, and in the relationship, in fact, what happens is, both become larger selves. Because when you get mirrored, as we will talk about in the exercise, when you mirrored you get expanded. The experience of feeling and seeing yourself in the accurately reflected in the eyes of another, grounds one's own sense of self identity. Of who you are. And then you move that more deeply and say, not only do I see you, but you make sense! Which is the validation piece grounds you even deeper in your own confidence and when they also say, gosh, and I can also imagine how you must be feeling, they move into empathy, and you experience the whole universe expanding so that two people are in some sense, side by side, rather than either one occupying the center. And the world becomes a much softer and gentler place. 

00:23:30
JON CARLSON Well let's- 

00:23:30
PAT LOVE I'm ready. 

00:23:30
JON CARLSON Let's get on with it, let's find out how to do this mirroring, and validation, and- 

00:23:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, I'm ready to do it too. 

00:23:35
JON CARLSON Empathy, and become conscious communicators. 

00:23:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

00:23:40
Introduction: The Imago Process 

00:23:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX I wanna thank you again for coming, and uh, welcome you. Uh, to this, to this day. And, um, appreciate what you're going to contribute to other couples, and hope that in the process of making that contribution, you'll get something for yourself that will hopefully last a lifetime. Uh, I will have to say, though, it's like any skill, if you don't practice it, it only lasts as long as you practice it. And, so there's nothing magic about it. I was thinking how to start in the few minutes of oriented you to what we wanna do today. Um, so I think, here's, here's the thoughts that I have. One is to say that what we're going to demonstrate, and what you, what I'm gonna invite you to experience with me, is what we call imago relationship therapy. Which is, the, couples therapy bodality that I've, uh, evolved along with Helen, my partner, uh, is um, is the signature of that, uh, therapy, and of that theory of process, and it's called dialogue. That's the core, uh, methodology that's used in that system, because, as we work with couples over the years, we become aware of something very central. And that is that there's a common problem that goes across all couples experiences, which is what we're calling the rupture of connection. And that all problems seem to be, to arise out of that sense of ruptured connection. And that when couples are in connection, that they experience, in fact, uh, fewer problems, and if something does come up, then it's simply a problem to be solved, and not an issue to be argued about, you know, those long things you argue about for two or three hours, two or three days, two or three weeks, some two or three months. Some have been arguing about them for two or three years, that the fundamental thing, is the, is the rupture of connection. And therefore what we need is to, as couples, is to have a way to make, to make connection, and to maintain connection. And that if we can make connection and keep connection, then we in some sense are responding to what is seems to be a core human need. That's not just an option for us. Um, but, something that's fundamentally definitional of who we are as a human being. And that is, that we are connectional beings. And when that connection is ruptured, then we feel anxious, and we do very strange interesting things often that amplify the disconnection. But even that amplification, like conflict and fights, or in the service of tying to reconnect, which of course, because of the methods we use, disconnect, so that what we need to do, and what we wanna do today, is to spend some time with the details of a connectional process that we call dialogue. So before we do this, I'd like to tell you just a little brief story about how all this got started. I mentioned, um, Helen, my, uh, wife, and partner in the creation of imago. When we were dating, uh, we discovered we had, um, after about two years into the dating, we had a, a pattern, uh, of arguing that was pretty intense. Even at that time. And, uh, one day, in the middle of one of these, uh, arguments, do I need to describe what an argument is? Yall think you know what that is? So, you've been, you've been in one of those before. Where you, in two of those before. And it's, uh, or three maybe. Yeah. And everybody looks like they have a unique argument, but actually all arguments are the same. That is, both people are trying to win, while both are losing. Is that, does that make sense? I'm trying to get my way, you're trying to get your way, neither one of us is having our way. Uh, my way or, my way or no way. Um, well we were into one of these, and it was a, a pattern that we were noticing, and it was Helen who said, Harville, let's stop. Let's stop. And so I finally stopped. And she said, let's one person talk, and the other person listen. It was like, a rather revolutionary idea. She's a psychologist, I was, at that time, uh, doing marital therapy, already full time, and what, you know, but we weren't practicing at home. So, we did stop, and out of that stopping and looking at what we were doing, we began to think about, uh, a process by which couples could, hav-, bu-, actually it was a process by which we could be together. So that what we finally put together was a dialogue process which was, to mirror what your partner is saying, uh, as clearly and accurately as you can. A mirror means reflecting it back accurately. Flat mirror. See the partner's point of view. The logic inherent in their thinking. And, you don't have to agree with it, and then move to what it must feel like for your partner to live in that world, to have that experience. To be feeling those feelings, or having those thoughts. In other words, the empathic piece which puts you then in communion. And that's the exercise, and the process that we want to demonstrate with you today, and uh, which we hope you will learn and integrate into your lives. 

00:29:35
Exercise 1 Mirroring 

00:29:35
Mirroring Sender Receiver (Makes a short statement) "Let me see if I got that..." (Mirrors) "Did I get it?" 

00:29:35
"Yes or No" (if "no") What part of it didn't I get? 

00:29:35
"Yes" "Is there more about?" 

00:29:35
"Continues ...until" "Let me see if I got all that..." (Summarizes) "Did I get it all?" 

00:29:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So what we gonna teach now is the dialogue process, and particularly the first part of the dialogue, which is called mirroring. And I think the best way to think about this is that there is always a sender and a receiver. And the sender is the person who has something they need to say to their partner, the receiver is the person who is practicing mirroring. And so, when the sender says uh, could I have a dialogue, I'd like to talk with you about something that's important to me, the receiver says, uh, that they do have time, and they listen uh to what the sender is saying. There's certain sentence stems that are very helpful in doing the dialogue process. One is, after the sender has, uh, said something, sent their first message, the receiver says, "Uh, lemme see if I got that." And then they reflect back a mirror back, what they heard, and they check. "Did I get it?" The sender says, um, 'Yes or no'. Uh, if the sender says no, then the receiver says well, did you send the part I didn't get, and they keep doing that until the message is heard accurately. Then the receiver, the one getting the message, says, is there more about that. And the sender says, uh, yes, there is more, and they send more, and the receiver continues to mirror, and say, is there more until the person talking, sending the message, says there is no more. At that point, the receiver says, well let me see if I've got all of that. And then they do a summary of all that they've heard into a kind of condensed and hopefully elegant paraphrase, uh, after they have, uh said, let me see if I've got it all, and they do the paraphrase, they check, did I get it all? And the sender says yes or no. Uh, and if the sender says yes, then they say, then that is the end particularly of the mirroring process. Then you shift into the phases that come after that. Called validation. And, uh, empathy, which we'll talk about in a moment. Well let me see, I, your Sigh- 

00:31:40
SIGH Correct. 

00:31:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And your Kim. 

00:31:45
KIM Yes. 

00:31:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Um, and, um, what you're here to help, uh, me do, is to demonstrate, and for you to learn, uh, the dialogue process. And I wanna thank you for being here. And doing this with me. And for all of us. Um, and I believe in uh, in talking about it, you have decided that you have something you'd like to say. 

00:32:05
SIGH Yes. 

00:32:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so you're going to practice what we call sending. And you're going to listen, and practice what we call, uh, in the role of receiver, and practice mirroring, in order to make contact with what he's expressing. Okay? Okay. So, in doing this, I want you to look at each other, rather than at me, and so you might wanna turn and get a-, sort of a comfortable, uh, face on there. Um, and um, Sigh, would you start with what you want to say to Kim. 

00:32:35
SIGH Kim, punctuality is not one of your virtues. Regardless of where we're going, when we're goin', you're never ready on time. You're not a little bit late, you're five minutes late, 20 minutes late, today you were half an hour late. Why? I just don't understand why? 

00:32:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So now let me see if I've got that Sigh. 

00:32:55
KIM Let me see if I've got that, Sigh. You don't see punctuality as one of my virtues, and um, no matter where we go, I'm always late. And whether it's five minutes, 10 minutes, today being half an hour late, I'm always late. 

00:33:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that? 

00:33:15
SIGH Well she got most of it. 

00:33:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so, you say, did I get that? 

00:33:20
KIM Did I get that? 

00:33:20
SIGH You've got most of it, but ther-, there's other things that go along with that, you don't understand what's going on with me as you're puts-in around the kitchen. As you're signing papers, there's a lot goin' on, I'm gettin' hot because I have my coat on, we're burning gas in the car 'cause it's out there waiting for you. So you got most of it. 

00:33:40
KIM Okay, so- 

00:33:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I've got that. 

00:33:40
KIM Let me see if I have that. Um, in addition to being late, you're getting hot because your waiting with your coat on, there's gas burning in the car because you've got the car running, and all this time, I'm puts-ing around in the kitchen. 

00:33:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that? 

00:33:55
KIM Did I get all that? 

00:34:00
SIGH Yes. 

00:34:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

00:34:00
KIM Is there more? 

00:34:05
SIGH You have it, but what are you gonna do about it, I mean, i-, i-, it's easy to say, okay I'll be ready on time, but you have to do somethin' about it. You just can't keep sayin' yeah, okay, I'll be ready. Clock is constantly ticking and moving. 

00:34:20
KIM So what I hear you saying is, um, that even though I say I got it, I need to do something with it, and not to say I'll be on time, but actually do it in my actions, rather than just my words. And, the clock is constantly ticking. Did I get all that? 

00:34:40
SIGH Yes, you did get all of it this time. 

00:34:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

00:34:45
KIM Is there more? 

00:34:45
SIGH No, I'm happy with that. 

00:34:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so just stay with that, uh, I'm happy with that a minute, and but also stay inside your body and see if you can feel anything else coming up. That you would also like to say. Some more about that, about doing something about it, or what it's like to be late. Just stay with your body for a little bit and see what you feel. 

00:35:10
SIGH I'm not accustomed to bein' late. And I, I always get where I'm going, ahead of time. I like bein' there on time. It's very important to me to be punctual. 

00:35:20
KIM So I hear you saying that you're not accustomed to being late, and that being on time is very important to you. And, that, being punctual is something that is very important to you. Did I get all that? 

00:35:35
SIGH Yes you did. 

00:35:40
KIM Is there more? 

00:35:40
SIGH No, that's pretty much it. 

00:35:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, um, so now would you, um, say let me see if I've got all of that. And, uh, take all that he said and pull it into a real short summary statement. 

00:36:00
KIM Let me see if I've got all of that. Um, basically, when I'm late, it is really frustrating for you. And, it's not that I'm just late once, but it's all the time. It's like, habitual thing to, to me, and yet, just as it's habitual for me to be late, it's habitual for you to be early. So that's really difficult for you, when I'm always late. 

00:36:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it all? 

00:36:35
KIM Did I get it all? 

00:36:35
SIGH You gotta change it though. I guess I can say that you gotta change it. 

00:36:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so if I'm getting it, I've got what you said, but you're really concerned about my changing it. 

00:36:45
KIM Okay, so if I've got all of what you said- 

00:36:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX I'm also hearing- 

00:36:55
KIM I'm also hearing that you'd really like me to change that. 

00:36:55
SIGH Yes, I would. I'd like you to be on time. 

00:37:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX You'd like me to be on time. 

00:37:00
KIM You'd like me to be on time. 

00:37:05
SIGH Yes. 

00:37:05
Exercise 1 Mirroring 

00:37:05
UNKNOWN You're upset because you feel like you have to stand in place of my memory. That is, you have to be my memory for me sometimes. You have other obligations, they're your own. And, uh, being my memory is not one of them. Did I get all that? 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Is there more? Did I, did I miss part, the, your yes sounded like hesitating yes. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Yet now, because you've decided you wanted this other place, it's okay for us to have a 30 year mortgage, and I don't understand why I feel like you're always putting us in financial, it, it just, we're in a bind. I mean, we can make the payments, but now we have to, we don't have any breathing space. I need some breathing space financially. In our relationship. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN What I'm hearing you say is that you're- 

00:38:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I've got that. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN Let me see if I've got that. You're concerned about the cost of purchasing this new house, the cost of put-, implementing all the air-conditioning- 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN You are feeling kinda confused, and you weren't sure if it was more like a superficial problem, or something more serious. And, um, I, is that... I know there was more, but I, I'm just trying to really- 

00:38:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that? 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, did I get that? 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN Um, th, that was the first part, and then when- 

00:38:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Just send the second part again. So, say send the second part again. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Oh, would you send the second part again? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Uh, the second par tis that I was afraid the more you talked about your feelings, that the more you might get stuck in them. 

00:38:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX It often is, 'cause it often catalyzes an aspect of yourself. Another, you know, an issue that may be a complimentary frustration with her. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN Maybe I'll do that. Here's something I was thinkin about while you were talkin'. Can we go over that? 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Okay, uh. While you were discussin' some of the thoughts that you and about our conversations, and about how they sometimes, um, change focus, or get interrupted. It reminded me that, uh, oftentimes, when I'm talking about things with you, or with others, that, uh, sometimes there's a void in my thoughts. You know, uh, that I can get to a point where I lose the track of what my thought was, and it's very frustrating because I'm not sure what- 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN You know, we don't have, we don't have time together, 'cause we're so busy payin' for this life we're building that we can't enjoy. I mean, I don't, I don't wanna move into a place that's gonna put us in such a financial situation that we now have no life together, 'cause we're payin for this wonderful life. That we don't have. You know, we're living it separate. We're payin' for a house, but we're living the life separate, because we can-, we can't afford to be there together. 

00:40:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I'm getting all this. 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN Let me see if I'm getting all this. You're concerned about the total financial cost of purchasing a small house- 

00:40:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX ...what's going on so far, that he says, okay, so so far, it's bla bla bla bla bla, did I get that? Yeah, you got that, okay. So is there more? And you'll go down, and you get an overload again, little reaction inside, stomach turns, gut runs over, stop. Always stop at the point of a reaction. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN that's really good advice. 

00:40:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX After the reaction, you're not listening. So the, so the proc-, and he knows it. Or if you were sending, you would know it, you can feel the disturbance, when the other person's eyes, you can see the calculations going on, on a defensive posture- 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN And I wanna help you out, and I guess, then I'm doing- 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN Trying to, digest all of this, and trying to remember everything, and then the next thing is, you're shifting gears, and it's like there's more things I have to try to remember, and it's, big gaps between the last, let me get it, until the next one is-, you know I'm- 

00:41:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX You're gonna have a really big summary. Complete summary. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Just trying to remember everything- 

00:41:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, so just hold that, when you feel yourself slipping, just say, hold it a second, let me see if I've got it so far. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN What I'm doin' is I'm waiting until she's taking a breath- 

00:41:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And by that time, you've got three subjects- 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you can't hold 'em all. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN You know I'm, I'm from- 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN You're not, you're unsure where you're goin, but I think, I think you should, like I, I don't even know how I wanna, I know I wanna go through this that, I think I know where you're, where you wanna go, and I'm upset because you won't say it to me. Did I get that? 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Uh, right up till the last part. 

00:42:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So send that part again. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Would you send that part again, then? 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Um, sometimes I sense some frustration and anger on your part, and it's frustrating for me, it may get to a point where I- 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Can you tell me a little more? Is there more about that? 

00:42:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, good. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Okay, um, yeah, I don't wanna sound selfish, but, the more I heard you, talk about it, the more worried that I felt. I kinda felt like, um, you know, I don't wanna living with a woman whose always complaining, or about dad, and- 

00:42:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And she'll get frustrated 'cause it's not right. But if you stop, in that piece, and you have to let him stop, and then you get the next piece, then you stop again and get the next piece, then when you summarize it, you'll have it clear. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Because in, the shifting gears- 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Well I, I think- 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN You've got like 80 percent of it, or 90 percent of it, it's, there's a little, was, at the end, a little interpretation problem. See now I've just done one of those to myself. I get to the point where I have a thought and it's gone. And I can't- 

00:43:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so you had a thought, and it's gone now. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN So you had a thought, and it's gone now- 

00:43:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN Is there more about that? 

00:43:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So see the important thing is that whatever's happening with you is happening with you. Like, losing your memory right now. So she wants to know, is there more about that, losing memory. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN There is, it's where the frustration starts. 

00:43:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Inside of you. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Inside of me is where the frustration starts, because I want to continue, and can't find the starting place again. 

00:43:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And the summary is, uh, well let me see if I've got all of that. And you do it with some, you know, curiosity, and and humbleness. Well let me ask if you if I've got all of that. Instead of, let me see if I've got all of that, you, you want to not judge her. For her send. But to see if you've really got her send, because what you're wanting to do is, experience, who's this person, she lives over here. You know. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Take a, cleansing breath here, there's a lotta, lotta stuff in there. Lemme see if I have, uh, all of this. Um, you're very concerned about, uh, the purchase of this new house, um, concerned- 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Not really, that covers a lotta territory. 

00:44:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So that covers most of it. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN So that covers most of it? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN There's well, no it doesn't. 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN There's still more about that. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN There's a sense of not being able to fulfill an obliga-, uh, I don't know if it's, there's a sense that I can't fulfill an obligation that I have. Desire, or willingness to advance in the company. You know, and that kinda behavior that you said you see, and I kinda want, eh, doesn't really matter, you know, I'll be happy where I'm at, for right now. Uh, sometimes I wonder, with that sense of failure in conversations If I'm gonna be able to fulfill bigger obligations, like that, and so it makes me wanna shy away from- 

00:45:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Good work, keep going. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Well let's see if I got that. 

00:45:30
Please Pause Here & Practice 

00:45:30
Exercise 2 Validation 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:35
Validation Sender Receiver (Review Summary) "Let me see if I got all of that..." "Did I get it all?" 

00:45:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So now we'd like to pick up on the movement from mirroring to validation. Um, if you worked on mirroring, and taken a break, and come back to it, it's very important that you pick up with the summary. Which is, let me see if I've got all of that. It's important re-summarize what you've heard, you will get the whole message that's being sent. And more likely be able to experience the, the truth of what the partner is saying, or the logic of what the partner is saying as they have been talking to ya. So you say, let me see if I've got it all, and once you've checked with your partner that you've got it all, then you say well, um, I I can see the sense in that. It makes sense to me that you would feel that way because, this event occurred and I did that. Which is the validation piece. The partner, uh, hears you validate, and you know that you have validated your partner, when your partner uh, gives you some clue, usually in body clue, namely they experience some relaxation, or they may give you a verbal clue and say, that's my world, that's my experience. 

00:47:00
KIM Basically, what I'm late, it is really frustrating for you. And it's not that I'm just late once, but it's all the time. And it's like a habitual thing to, to me, and yet, just as it's habitual for me to be late, it's habitual for you to be early. So that's really difficult for you, when I'm always late. 

00:47:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it all? 

00:47:25
KIM Did I get it all? 

00:47:25
SIGH You gotta change it, though. Because I, can say it, but you gotta change. 

00:47:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so if I'm getting it, I've got what you said, but you're really concerned about my changing it. 

00:47:40
KIM Okay, so, if I've got all that you said- 

00:47:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX I'm also hearing. 

00:47:40
KIM I'm also hearing that you'd really like me to change that. 

00:47:45
SIGH Yes, I would. I'd like you to be on time. 

00:47:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX You'd like me to be on time. 

00:47:50
KIM You'd like me to be on time. 

00:47:55
SIGH Yes. 

00:47:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so, now, um, would you, would you say to him, um, a sentence that validates his reality. That is, you know, you make sense. Or, I can see the sense you're making. Send or pick one or the other of those, that comes up for you, in which you indicate you can see the sense that he's making. So, you make sense because. And you fill in the rest of the blanks. 

00:48:20
KIM I can see the point that you're making. Um, because, being early, or being on time is something that's always been important to you, and it's me that's making you late. And it's something that isn't a part of who you are as a person. And, it's something that you would really like for me to change, because it really frustrates you a lot. 

00:48:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that makes sense. 

00:48:50
KIM And that makes sense. 

00:48:50
SIGH Yes. 

00:48:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, does that feel like she got what you were saying? The real truth of it? 

00:49:00
SIGH Yes it does. She listened. 

00:49:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX She listened. Okay. 

00:49:05
Exercise 2 Validation 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Let me see if I got that. You feel frustrated and overwhelmed that I don't help enough on the chores, and on the house, and I don't help enough with the kids, but you're building up anger and resentment towards me, and that's also what is affecting our intimacy. Did I get that? 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Okay, you got some of it. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN What I miss? 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN I'm, I'm overwhelmed and I'm frustrated, taking care of the kids, and doing the chores. Not that you're not doing enough of them, that. I'm overwhelmed with what I'm doing. I'm frustrated with what I'm, for me. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN So you feel frustrated and overwhelmed with what you're doing, and you have anger and resentment towards me about our intimacy. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN No the anger and the resentment is about the frustration and the overwhelmed feelings. I keep saying it differently each time, so that's not helping at all. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Yes you do, it seems like. Um, so you're saying that you're angry and frustrated- 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN About being overwhelmed. I'm angry and resentful. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN You're angry and resentful- 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN About being frustrated-. Now do you have it? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yes. I should be asking her that, did I get all that? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I don't know, did you? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yes, I did. 

00:50:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so to check it out, why don't you say, well let me see if I've got it all. And you put it all together without your coaching. So if I've got all that. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Okay, lemme see if I got that. You're angry, and you're frustrated about how I'm not helping out enough with the chores- 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN I've not said that you don't do enough with the kids and with the chores, and keep telling me that I'm saying that. 

00:50:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, yeah, so- 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN I just keep telling that I'm overwhelmed and frustrated about what I'm doing with the kids and the chores. 

00:51:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Let me try again. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Alright, let me try again. Um, you feel that you're overwhelmed and frustrated by what you're doing with the kids. Did I get it all? Did I get it all? 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN You got it all. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN All right. We got it. Finally. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Now we can- 

00:51:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, uh, do, do you wanna try that again? 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Uh- 

00:51:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Without my coaching this time? 'Cause it's a very important message that she's sending, that you're shifting. And so it's very important that she get it, that you've got it. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:51:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX That little subtle shift. Which is, not you, not doing things, it's her doing too many things. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:51:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX It's either yes or no, and if I didn't get it, I'll have to do it again- 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN Well you just don't have it all. You just don't have it all. 

00:51:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So send me the piece again that I'm missing. Just that piece. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Just the piece that we're missing. I'm feeling, overwhelmed with what I'm doing. And I'm building up anger towards you. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN Angry towards me. And you feel that's at, affecting our, your intimacy, or our intimacy, together. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Right. Mmhmm. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Did I get that? 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN You got it. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Is there any more? 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN No. 

00:52:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so that's the summary? That's basically the message. 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN That's the summary, mmhmm. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN Okay, it makes sense to me that you're frustrated and angry because I should be helping out more with the kids, or I could be helping out more with the kids. 

00:52:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is it right? You know you've got it when you see her body relax. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Since her body didn't relax, too intense. So let's, can I hint ya some models? 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:52:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is that all right? Okay, so let-, let me just model it, and see if, if I can get it. 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:52:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Um, so, it makes sense to me that if you're frustrated at all of the things you're doing, and overwhelmed by them, it makes sense to me you'd be getting angry. And that it'd be getting angry at me. 'Cause I'm the one here. And, that being angry at me you, you wouldn't wanna be intimate with me. It would be affecting your intimacy. That really makes sense. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:53:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so, try that on. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Try that on- 

00:53:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX The thing is, that, that I'm hearing her uh, feeling non-validated about is you're including yourself in this as the problem. 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:53:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX And she is saying, if I'm hearing you right, you're not the problem. You may not be doing all this stuff she's talking about. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Okay, well this makes sense to me. That you're frustrated. And when you get frustrated, the things that you're doing, you get angry, and the angry, the anger is not letting you, wanting to be intimate with me. Did I get that right this time. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN You, you, you're gettin' there honey. You're gettin' there honey. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN The, the frustration and the overwhelmed feelings cause me- 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Well, because the breakfast is getting cold, I'm getting frustrated too. Because I put all the sufferin' into making a big omelet, and now it's getting cold, and then I have to try and keep it hot, and then sometimes it gets too stiff, and then I don't like to eat it. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN Okay. So, let me see if I got that right. Um, you feel that, you feel frustrated because um- Uh, as it would originally. 

00:54:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it all? 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN Did I get it all? 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So now's a sentence, uh, the validation sentence. So, that makes sense, I can see the sense in that. Uh, you make sense because, sort of pick which one seems to flow with your mind- 

00:55:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Well that makes sense. Because i can see that um, having a, a warm breakfast is very important, and I feel that, um, I can see the sense in, that you want, us to sit down to a warm breakfast, and not a re-warmed breakfast. 

00:55:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that you might be frustrated- 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN And that you, and I see that you are frustrated by that. 

00:55:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX When I go to take a shower instead of eat. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN And I see that you're frustrated that, um, I go take a shower, uh, instead of coming and eating. 

00:55:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that makes sense. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN And that makes sense. I can see why you're frustrated. 

00:55:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, that's right. I can see why you've-, can you feel the validation? 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX That like he got it- 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX 'Cause usually it's in your body. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I just feel like phew. 

00:55:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. That's it. So now, switch and do it again. 

00:55:55
[sil.] 

00:55:55
Please Pause Here & Practice 

00:55:55
Exercise 3 Empathy 

00:55:55
Validation Sender Receiver "Yes" "It makes sense to me that give your experience you would think and/or feel and/or act that way." 

00:55:55
Empathy Sender Receiver "And given your experience, I can imagine you might feel ______ Is that the feeling?" 

00:56:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, when you finish the validation, uh, inter-transaction, the next and very important piece is the communication of empathy. Which is the experience of communicating to your partner your experience of their feelings about the experience that they have had. If you've taken a break, uh, again, in the tape, and are coming back to it, it's important that you state the validation again. So that you can experience through tha, the, uh, empathy. So the validation is, you make sense to me because, given the experience you've had, you would have that response, that thought, and that feeling. And then you go on with the empa-, with the empathic piece, which is, and I can imagine, that given that experience, you must feel, or might feel, angry, sad, hurt, glad, mad, whatever feeling that you think is appropriate to that experience. Then you check with your partner, and say, is that the feeling? If your partner confirms that that is their feeling, then you know that you have, uh, expressed, uh, an empathic, you've made an empathic comment, you made an empathic connection. If your partner says no that's not the feeling, then you check, well then what was the feeling, and they say, well it wasn't anger, it was sadness, so then you correct, self-correct. So it wasn't anger that you were feeling, it was sadness that you were feeling, am I getting that right now? Yes. So I get it, it's sadness. And that makes sense. And so that completes the empathic piece. 

00:57:45
KIM And I can imagine, with what you've experienced, as far as me always being late, that you must feel extremely frustrated, and impatient. And, angry. 

00:58:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX And are those the feelings? 

00:58:00
KIM Are those the feelings you feel? 

00:58:00
SIGH Not so much angry, but definitely frustrated. Yes. 

00:58:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, rephrase, so not so much angry, just frustrated. 

00:58:10
KIM So not so much angry, but just frustrated. 

00:58:15
SIGH Yes. Those are my feelings. 

00:58:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And they make sense. 

00:58:20
KIM And they make sense. 

00:58:20
Exercise 3 Empathy 

00:58:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX And just when you're ready, you feel like you can shift into his role now- 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:58:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX But don't push yourself too quickly. If you were at home, I'd say take about an hour. At let's let this settle. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Mm-kay. Um, so, in, in summary, I hear you say that, um, when I have to set the alarm, and put it on snooze, an hour before I intend, or am able to get up, especially on the days that you have off, that that disturbs your sleep. That it's frustrating, that you feel less important when you have to nudge me to turn off the alarm clock, because your sleep's been disturbed. Am I gettin' it? 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Mmhmm. 

00:59:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX I can see the sense in that. 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN It makes sense. It's understandable. That, um, you should be able to have some more time to yourself- 

00:59:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX No that's, that's of, that's sympathy. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:59:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Stay with validation. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:59:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX It makes sense, that given when you're off, and you wanna sleep, and I have to set the alarm, you don't get to sleep, blah blah blah. 

01:00:05
UNKNOWN Okay. It makes sense that when you have a day off, that you shouldn't have to get up when my alarm clock goes off. Repeatedly. That, um, you should be able to have some extra time to yourself without being disturbed. 

01:00:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX That really makes sense. 

01:00:25
UNKNOWN And that does make sense. 

01:00:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I can empathize with that. 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN I can empathize with that. 

01:00:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX I can imagine you must feel- 

01:00:35
UNKNOWN I can imagine you must feel, frustrated. Um, less important. Maybe angry. 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN Mm-mm. Frustrated. 

01:00:50
UNKNOWN Frustrated. 

01:00:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that makes sense. 

01:00:50
UNKNOWN And that makes sense. 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN Hm. 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN Did I get it? 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN You got it. That's it. 

01:01:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Now, now you have to watch his face. 

01:01:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:01:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX It's not, uh, in here. He has a, little- 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN All in his face. Yeah. 

01:01:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX His chin drops. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, it does. 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN You got it. 

01:01:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you're relaxed. 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN I saw that before. 

01:01:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, there it is. Good work. 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:01:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX You've done both now. 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:01:25
[sil.] 

01:01:25
Please Pause Here & Practice 

01:01:40
JON CARLSON This was a very emotional experience for me to watch. Why don't we find out, and see what happened to the audience, and get some feedback from them? Who has some experiences with mirroring? 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN Well what happened for me in mirroring was, we started out with a fairly simple problem, and it just seemed to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and all of a sudden, um, there w-, you know, encompassed a lot of issues for us, and stuff like that, yeah. I was surprised. 

01:02:20
JON CARLSON You had one of those mirrors that made everything expand, huh? 

01:02:25
UNKNOWN Um, yeah, it, well, it was one of those, you know, things are not as close as they seem, and you know, 'cause it seemed to be ther- 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN I we had, I had the same experience where I think that I thought that the, the subject, the issue that I was gonna be sending, was pretty concise and, you know was a one type of thing, but it added up being so much more complex. 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN Encompassed a lot more than just, the one main focal point, you know, expect-, it seemed to be bringing in more family problems, and, and other things that were kinda like all related that you didn't really realize all were intertwined. You know, it's like, you're looking at one point, and the next thing you know, it's like, well wait a minute, all this is part of this, and then, oh, this is more this is part of it, too, and it's like you're building a wall, because you put a stop or something down, and a brick, and then everything is all kinda, you know, pins on one thing, but it's got the this upside-down pyramid to where it's all- 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN We start at the wrong end. 

01:03:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX I, I, I often re-, refer to that as, um, you, you, you thought had a tail, but it turned out there was a dog attached to it. 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:03:35
PAT LOVE See, this, this makes sense about that, that, that when you really have, uh, a listener, um, I know for me, that turns me on. I mean, if I had someone listening, it's like, oh, well while I have your attention, and also, while I'm feeling safe enough, knowing that you're going to mirror, instead of interrupt, or criticize, or rebut, or shoot-reload, that somehow it, it does start to flow. And, and again, uh, as I mentioned earlier, that I often think out loud. So I may start with one subject, but then I'm really discovering my mind, as you're reflecting back. I'm really hearing myself mirroring. Is one of the unique times in life where you get an experience of yourself. What it's like living with you. That's why it scares me to do that. I don't think I wanna go there. 

01:04:25
KIM I had a, um, you know, I was, I guess, seeing it more from the receiver's point of view, and, um, you know that's what, for me, it was, um, when he was telling me, you know, about like the issue of lateness, and everything, it was hard not to get my defenses up, and just to be there, and hold everything he was saying, the hardest words were, is there more? 'Cause I didn't want there to be more. Isn't this enough? But it was hard to go beyond that. And, you know, create that holding environment. 

01:05:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, and the, isn't there more piece um, wa-, was built in through the experience of that, y-, people do want, you-, you do want your partner to stop. Once they get into this negative crazy stuff of theirs. You know, you just want 'em to stop. Uh, and react then, or respond to it. And, but it's like Pat's saying, if you do say the is there more, then it's amazing what more comes, and how interconnected so many things are. And, you really have to say, it has nothing, in a sense, to do with me, I'm not creating this reality in him. I'm now just meeting it. And, and gonna hold it. And I wish it were different, and you know, so I can say, is there more, and he would say, being with you is so fantastic, is there more about that? But he's saying something different. Yeah, thank you for commenting on that, 'cause that is the growth point. In being the receiver, is to ask is there more. Can I hear more of that negative stuff? 

01:06:05
KIM It's almost as hard as, to say you're sorry. 

01:06:10
SIGH As being the receiver, it also makes you listen. Because, you're gonna bounce it back off her. Is this what you really mean? So you're forced to listen. 

01:06:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. 

01:06:25
UNKNOWN True. 

01:06:25
UNKNOWN And um, as, as I was listening and just keep telling myself, all I have to do is mirror back, and ask more, the listening became easier to do. 

01:06:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Mm-hm. 

01:06:35
UNKNOWN And even though the problem might go deeper and deeper, it was easier to hear. Because I knew that all I had to do, I didn't have to defend, I didn't have to agree, I didn't have to-, all I had to do is say, so what I hear you saying is that, or let me see if I've got that. So it became easier to, to listen to the problem. 

01:07:00
UNKNOWN It-, the mirroring was the listening part. I really had to try to focus, and the word I hated was, wasn't was, or any more, it was, did I get it right. Because, it was the repeating, you know, and then he'd have to say it back, because you know, then I'd try to mirror back, and did you get it right. Okay, I'll do this, you know. And I imagine, as we practice and practice, I'll get better at it, but I really need to focus on my listening skills. And that's what, mirroring helped me, you know. I have no problems expressing myself, and the listening was, a lotta work. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Can be. 

01:07:40
UNKNOWN Yeah I did, did you get it right part was strong, 'cause he was not gettin' it right. And, just because, I guess, of our lifestyle, um, we don't have a lot of time together, so, if I don't get it right the first time, I may not have a second time. So this was really powerful for me. That when he said, did I get it, I could say, no, you didn't get it. Listen to me again. And, that was real powerful. To have his absolute undivided attention for those few minutes. It was, that was pretty dynamic. We don't get that, so that was, real powerful. 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN It was tough not to be able to say, yeah but! It's just repeat what she said. 

01:08:30
PAT LOVE And it sounds like it touched you, and I mean the energy- 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN Deeper. 

01:08:35
PAT LOVE It loo-, the look on your face looks beautiful from here. 

01:08:40
JON CARLSON You know in this over-choiced world, it's nice to know now you have one more choice, that maybe you didn't have prior to this experience, that you can choose maybe to use your time a little differently. Yeah. How 'bout the process of validation? What was that like for you? 

01:09:00
UNKNOWN I guess my comment has to go with mirroring and validation, was, um, my partner and I couldn't move to validation because I couldn't get everything I wanted from the mirroring. Like, I had to have all of my words mirrored back. Every piece needed to be um, repeated back to me before we-, before I could feel validated. And it had to be done in the mirroring, and the validation, 'cause some of it was lost, or not there. 

01:09:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the validation for you was to have everything that you said, said. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX In the sense of all that. Be seen. 

01:09:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:40
UNKNOWN Every thing. 

01:09:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Every thing. 'Cause you wanted, you wanted the whole piece, the whole cloth. 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Not just kind of a, capsule of it, but the whole thing. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:09:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that was important for you. 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:09:55
JON CARLSON Don't thorough people, aren't they somehow attracted to people who are brief to? 

01:10:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX And sometimes a little vague. 

01:10:05
JON CARLSON And a little vague. Yeah, so there's kind of a draw, that they admire those qualities in one another. Yeah. 

01:10:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did you get the subliminal message in that question? 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Do you want us to run that back? 

01:10:25
UNKNOWN One of the parts, I think, of validation that's hardest, but maybe just because we're just starting this, is, uh, it, it seems insincere. When you do it the first few times, it's like very I think Harville used the word 'woodened'. You know, it's real structured and false and phony and, it feels put on, you know, and y-, and you think, geeze, this ain't workin'. And it makes you kinda wanna stop, you know. Or, or, or see it as insincere comin' from the other person. 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN You're trying' to paraphrase all this information into like a a short little validation that, you know, I do understand what you're saying, and try to say it with meaning, I mean it, it was awkward. Uh, I think that the more we try this, that the easier it'll get, but it just seems very, we're not used to it yet, it's kinda like a new- 

01:11:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Right, we're, none of us are used to, not only as couples, but in the collective society, none of us are used to the practice of saying, I can see what you're saying, and you make sense. Especially if I disagree with you. It's hard to say to another person. You make sense. You know, I can, you make sense. You're a Freudian, and I can see the sense a Freudian makes. You know, and, and not, and say that in such a way that the person who's the Freudian doesn't feel put down, patronized, but genuinely, I see there's logic in your thinking. Given this premise, this outcome makes sense. Now, I'm not a Freudian, I don't have to be one, to see that you make sense, being a Freudian. And that it's a valid reality. It's not just an arbitrary reality, it's a valid reality. You exist, you're not me. I often say to couples, it's really shocking to discover you live with another person. 

01:12:15
[sil.] 

01:12:20
JON CARLSON So more about validation? 

01:12:20
KIM Uh, yeah, I, thought, um, the, the whole experience of validation, it was so nice to really be heard. And really feel that, you know, my partner really understood what I was saying, because obviously, this isn't the first time we've spoke about this issue, you know, it's come up so many other times, but maybe it's the first time we've ever completed it. You know, as far as, both of us listening to each other, and saying our piece, and then it seemed, you know, like there was that shift. Where a common solution was kind of worked out without us even, addressing it. Because we both were able to understand exactly where the other person was coming from, and see everything on the table. Instead of just my side versus his side. 

01:13:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX That's lovely, see that's the magic in the paradox. If we both, if we become selves, honor each other's separate reality, which had been the base of our conflict, what happens is those two realities then, can then soften into a co-created new reality. That satisfies the needs in both. And without that, without that point of connection, there's no solution. Is that, am I tracking what made sense for you? 

01:13:35
KIM Oh yeah. 

01:13:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX And you all actually moved, um- 

01:13:40
KIM I feel we did. 

01:13:40
SIGH Yes. 

01:13:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Through an almost automatic- 

01:13:45
SIGH On that issue, on that issue. 

01:13:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX On that issue. 

01:13:50
SIGH While we were talking about that issue, you're talking about two becoming one. We had mentioned earlier where there are only winners, there are no losers. What happens when you come across an issue that, that's a cold fact, for instance, I wanna live where it's cold, she wants to live where it's warm. I really can't see why she wants to live where it's warm, no matter how hard I try, I have a problem with that validation. At some point, to end this discussion, does somebody just roll over, and say fine we'll live there? 

01:14:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX No, the, the, the dialogue needs to go deeper until you can actually experience her need for warmth. And see that as a valid place. And when you can walk in her shoes, feel her heart, feel what it is like for her to be in the cold, how her body aches, when the wind blows on it, and imagine that, uh, then you'll be in her space. And she has to be in your space as well. See what it's like, you know, to, to, to be in warm. I mean, how you just sweat, and, you know, it's just uncomfortable, and you just feel, you know, you wish you had an air conditioner built into your skin. She's gotta walk in, in your footsteps, and experience your reality. At that point, you see, you're connected. And the solution, then, will arise out of that connection. It'll probably be neither cold nor hot. But it'll be something that addresses, uh, the, the, the problem will be something that addresses a need in both of you. But what will have occurred is that the two of you will be in communion. And that's more important, ultimately, than where you live. 'Cause you can live where you want to, and be ruptured, and it's awful. Uh, but if you can stay in communion, you can almost live anywhere. But, more than likely, what'll arise is a creative process. In which you-, you'll move somewhere, or talk about, or have a solution that addresses some of what you need, and some of what you need, and it's okay. It's not a lose-lose. Or win-lose. It's a win-win. The win-win is, we are in contact, we are in connection, and we're experiencing communion. That's the win. Everything else will arise out of that. 

01:16:05
JON CARLSON So it isn't, the solution isn't as important as this process. 

01:16:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Absolutely not. And, I don't even have to help couples work on problems any more. 'Cause you can't solve a problem in the same consciousness with which you created the problem. You actually have to move out of that consciousness. And the way you move out is, become aware of another consciousness. Because most of us live as if we are the center, and others are on the periphery. What we have to do is to share the center with our partner. The dialogue process enables you to share the center. Now you have a bigger universe. You have a universe with two centers. That make sense? Out of that two-centered-ness, uh, you're not in another consciousness. So the problem you had, when there was one center, and one on the periphery, is gone. 'Cause the center's changed. You don't change the center, forget it. You can never solve a problem as long as the center remains the same. 

01:17:05
UNKNOWN What you're sayin' is, um, kinda somethin' that I experienced in-, when I was doin' the validation, I started just mouthing the words, and I didn't really-, and then all of a sudden my brain kicked in to, you know, this may be does make sense. And, um, and then I felt something shift in me, or something. 

01:17:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes! Yes, yes. When you see it, something happens to you. What? You have two realities now. And she does make sense. Everybody makes sense. That's so shocking. Everybody makes sense. Even the schizophrenic in the back wards of the worst mental hospital in Illinois makes sense. Everybody makes sense, including, for God's sakes, your partner! You live, you don't live with a crazy person. Or an insane person. But if you say to them, that didn't make any sense, you're really telling them they're crazy. Then what do they have to do? They have to tell you you're crazy. Or they have to prove they're not crazy. And then after a while, it all looks crazy. But your partner makes sense, and once that's felt, like you just talked about it, something happens in your consciousness. Now you're at another level. You can go up. 

01:18:20
JON CARLSON And, and speaking' of the feeling, get some feedback on that last piece, the empathy piece. 

01:18:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, what was that like? To express and experience empathy. 

01:18:30
UNKNOWN Uh, does the receiver necessarily have to know what the sender is feeling? 

01:18:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX No. No- 

01:18:40
UNKNOWN Is it my-, is it, is it the receiver's responsibility to know what the sender is feeling? 

01:18:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX No. 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:18:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX It's, um, it's the receiver's responsibility to be able to imagine that given that experience, one might be feeling a certain way. 

01:18:55
UNKNOWN And if the receiver does guess wrong is it up to the sender to tell that person. 

01:19:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes, and so what you do is always check out. 

01:19:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:19:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it? You were mad? Oh no, I wasn't mad. I was really sad. Oh, it wasn't mad, it was sad. So it was sad. Is there more about sad? 

01:19:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:19:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that makes sense. Yes. You-, if a person is expressing their feelings, and you say, I can see you're really, really angry, then you, you know, you say that. Because you see it, you can't miss it. It's anger. Ahh! You know, the person's doing it. or they're crying. I can see that you're sad about that. But, most of the time, the person's just communicating, wo-, what do you call it, a reported feeling, or sometimes they don't even report a feeling, they're just reporting an experience. So, it's, the empathy is the reach, then, into the feeling that must be there. And so it's a creative risk. And you have to allow your partner to do that. 'Cause what happens is you project your own feeling into it, your partner says, no, not mine, mine is this. Now what do we have. Clearer, two realities. One is, if I were in that situation, I'd feel this way. Oh, you don't feel that way? You feel this way. Oh my God. People can have that experience and feel different from me? Idn't that amazing? I live with another person! We are not, we are two in communion. Not two in fusion. 

01:20:25
UNKNOWN What it did, it, it clarified the other two steps for me.. because my feelings may have been different, and when I heard that he had a different feeling, if there was any thought left at all, in the mirroring, in the validation, by showing empathy, it cleared that up for me. Because now I-, okay, these are all the steps we went through, and he was feeling this way. 

01:20:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. 

01:20:50
UNKNOWN You know, and, this is the steps I would go, so, it would help me on the next issue, or whatever, to sort out, you know, these are the steps I go through, and this is how I feel, but then, you know, he goes through this stuff, and this is how he feels. Okay, so he doesn't feel like me all the time. 

01:21:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Never. 

01:21:10
UNKNOWN Oh! So you've talked to him, huh? 

01:21:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Isn't it wonderful that you don't live with yourself? In his body? 

01:21:20
UNKNOWN On some days. 

01:21:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And wouldn't it be great if they were just like us. 

01:21:25
UNKNOWN Sometimes. 

01:21:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Sometimes. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN Sometimes. 

01:21:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX But they never are. 

01:21:30
UNKNOWN No. 

01:21:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so that's the challenge of relationship. Is to live with another person. Really live with another person. Consciously. 

01:21:40
JON CARLSON I was just thinking that I'm learning about how to be a conscious communicator with these steps, with the mirroring, the validating, the empathy, now it's time to move on to seein' things change. 

01:21:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

01:21:55
JON CARLSON Can you show us how to do a behavior change request? 

01:21:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX I can, and I will. 

01:22:00
JON CARLSON Great. 

01:22:00
Exercise 4 Behavior Change Request 

01:22:00
Behavior Change Request Positive Say what is is you want, rather than what you don't want 

01:22:00
Behavior Change Request Measurable How many times a day, week or month 

01:22:00
Behavior Change Request Specific Exactly what and how you want it 

01:22:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, what we want to do now is to talk about what do you do after you have been in dialogue? Or, as a result of being in dialogue. Where can you go with the dialogue process? And what I'd like to, uh, however, say at the start is that once you deeply into a dialogical relationship, you will probably not go to this process. But until you get deeply into a dialogical process, you'll have the feeling of, what do we do, how can we get something going here, so, we want you to know about this process as a training and transitional process. Into a dialogical one. It's called the behavior change request process. Behavior change request like dialogue, uh, actually arose, also, a lotta this stuff arose out of mine and Helen's, uh, growth-filled relationship. I say that because we started growing as soon as we met. Uh, given that we met with some intensity, including attractive tension, and uh, splitting tension. And, uh, she has been so indispensable in this because she also came up with the idea that after we have one of us talk to, and the other one listened, the maybe, um, we should propose some solutions to the problem. And, what we discovered was that both of us always tended to ask for what the other person was least capable of giving in that moment. Uh, because, and what we learned out of that was that you always want what your partner is least capable of giving. That's why you married this person. Because just so you could repeat some experiences of childhood, but it's also another reason why you married the person is so that you would be the caller of them into their personal growth. If I want from you what you're least capable of giving, then in order to stretch and give that to me, which you do in the behavior change request process, you will then grow. So we want you to see how this process works. By which what your partner wants from you the most is what you're least capable of giving, but it's the point at which you need to grow the most. So your partner, in some sense, is a gift of nature to you. To faci-, to fu-, to facilitate, and activate your full potential. In the process, your partner gets healed, because you give them what they need, that they didn't get in childhood. In the process, you get to grow, into the part of you you didn't get to grow into in childhood. And so it involves, uh, basically the dialogue process. The difference is, you'll start off with a specific frustration. And, you'll state the frustration in a sentence, so that it's a really clear, not a whole long barrage, but just clear frustration. When you don't come home from work on time, I feel frustrated with, and want to do, so, so forth. So you state the frustration. Um, and then take that all the way through the, uh, mirror, the validation, and the empathy. At that point, we move then to action. In which the receiver is going to say, what can I do to help you with that? To heal that, or to help with that. And the sender then has to come up with, or is invited to come up with, three requests. Behavior change request. Three requests for behavior changes. They have to have a certain quality to them. They have to be specific, they have to be time-limited, they have to be do-able, uh, i.e., quantifiable. You have to be able to actually make something happen that can be measured. You get three requests. And then, uh, the sender, uh, having said the three requests, the res-, the, uh, receiver, picks from the three the one which they can do, uh, the best. That is, some of the three, as Helen and I learned, as we were doing this years ago, uh, among the three, is going to be that you gotta be feeling. Uh, there's no way in the world I could do that. Now, so you have to have three, because out of three, you always find there's one that do-able. Always, I've never seen a couple, in the thirty years of doing this, that couldn't do one of the three. Which means, you get started on change. So you make the specific request, would you come home on time, to uh, dinner, and if you're gonna be late, would you call me 30 minutes ahead of time, and let me know, and would you do that, uh, for, uh, twice a week. Every time you're late for the next three months. Um, and then you might add, uh, as somebody one time and when you are late, and you've called me, would you come home with, uh, a box of chocolates, and a rose. And when you come in the room, apologize profusely. And then, take me into the bedroom, and tell me how much you love me. And make wild passionate love to me and promise never to be late again. Think that's sort of, uh, a elegant one. But, briefly, it, it's that. Here's what I'd like you to do. Here's how, uh, when I'd like you do it, here's how often I'd like you to do it, and here's how long I'd like it to go on. Specificity. Time, place, quality. Once the three have been done, you pick the easiest one, and you give it to your partner as a gift. This is not a deal. This is not an exchange. It's not a quid-pro-quo. This is a gift. An unconditional gift, I will do this for you, um, without any conditions and without any requests back. And I'll do that, and we put it in this language because we've learned that only unconditional love heals. So you have to give a gift, it has to be a gift, and a gift is without conditions. You don't ask anything back when you give a gift. If you do, you've made a trade. And that neutralizes the power of the transaction. So you wanna give a gift. The person receives it as a gift, um, and then closes up with an appreciation. Which we'll walk you through. That's what we call a behavior change request. 

01:28:25
Exercise 4 Behavior Change Request 

01:28:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So which one of you a frustration that you'd like to use to practice this process with. 

01:28:30
ANGIE I'm gonna, I'm gonna use one of mine. 

01:28:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, Angie, you've got a frustration. 

01:28:35
ANGIE Yes. 

01:28:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, now here's the way this would work as a little different. You say, uh, can I have a dialogue with you about a frustration I have. So would yall turn and face each other a little more directly? And uh, keep eye contact with each other rather than with me. 

01:28:50
ANGIE Can I have a, dialogue with you about a frustration I have? 

01:28:55
UNKNOWN Yes you can. 

01:28:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, state the frustration in one sentence. 

01:29:00
ANGIE Um, I'm frustrated when you don't put your tools away after a pro-, after working on a project around the house. 

01:29:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So mirror that. If I've got this right- 

01:29:15
UNKNOWN If I've got this right, that you're frustrated at, when I complete a project, that I leave my tools laying around. Is that correct? 

01:29:20
ANGIE Yes it is. 

01:29:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that frustration? 

01:29:20
UNKNOWN Is there more about that frustration? 

01:29:25
ANGIE Um, yeah, I-, I feel like it, um, I have to function in clutter, that you've left after a project. That I can't get my projects done. 'Cause I'm working around yours. 

01:29:45
UNKNOWN So lemme get this straight, that, uh, your irritated because that, when I'm doin', when I get finished with a project, and when I leave my tools around, that it's a clutter that's in your way, so that you cannot do the projects that you need to do. Is that correct? 

01:30:00
ANGIE Yes. 

01:30:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

01:30:00
UNKNOWN So is there more about that? 

01:30:05
ANGIE Um, yeah, I feel like I have to clean up your, your stuff before I can start my stuff. So, it's like it adds to-, now it adds on to my load that I have to do. Because I have to finish something that you started. So now I'm doin' like your job and my job. 

01:30:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I got that. 

01:30:30
UNKNOWN So lemme see if I have that. That, you're frustrated because when I get done with a project, and if I leave my tools laying around, that you not only have to pick up my tools, and work around my clutter, that you have work that you have to do, which means it makes your job harder, because you're having to work around my clutter. 

01:30:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that? 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN Did I get that? 

01:30:55
ANGIE Yep. 

01:30:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN So is there more about that? 

01:31:00
ANGIE No. 

01:31:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So stay with the no, and with what that is, and would you say, and when you do that, it reminds me of, and then check your childhood, to see if there's a similar feeling. 

01:31:15
ANGIE W-, um, when you do that, it reminds me of, um, when I was a kid and maybe even a, like in my teens or somethin', I, throw requirements on me and my sisters were that we had to like take care of everything in the house, and get everything done before we could do anything enjoyable for ourselves. So we were-, you know, I's always cleanin' up for somebody else before I got a chance for myself. 

01:31:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I've got that. 

01:31:45
UNKNOWN So let me see if I've got that. This reminds you of when you were a child, that you and your sisters had to constantly clean up after your brothers and parents, and you had to do that before you could do anything for yourself. Is that correct? 

01:32:00
ANGIE Pretty close, yeah. It's, uh, my brothers were gone by that point, already, they were already adults, but, yeah we had to take care of the house before we could kinda like have a kid part of our life. 

01:32:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that made me feel... 

01:32:20
ANGIE Um, that made me feel like I was-, I couldn't be a kid. I couldn't just wake up and be a kid today, I had to wake up and think about what I had to do first before I could enjoy the day. You know. Couldn't just wake up to, and enjoy a day. 

01:32:40
UNKNOWN So let me, was that, me here- 

01:32:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Let's see if I got that- 

01:32:45
UNKNOWN Got that straight. Had-, you had to, every time you woke up, or when you woke up on a day that you had to look forward to cleaning and doing things around the house, you couldn't look forward to just being a kid. Is that correct? 

01:33:00
ANGIE Yes. It is. 

01:33:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

01:33:05
UNKNOWN So is there more about that? 

01:33:05
ANGIE No, that's what it was about. 

01:33:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so let me see if I've got all of that. 

01:33:15
UNKNOWN So let me see if I've got all of that. When I do my project, and if I leave my tools laying around, that the clutter that I create reminds you of when you were a child and had to wake up and clean the house before that you could be a kid, or do anything that you wanted to do. And, uh, is that correct? 

01:33:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it all? 

01:33:35
UNKNOWN Did I get it all? 

01:33:35
ANGIE Yup. Yes you did. 

01:33:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, you make sense, because. 

01:33:45
UNKNOWN You make sense because I should be- 

01:33:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Stay with just her truth. 

01:33:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:33:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX That makes sense to me because, when I leave my stuff around- 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN That makes sense to me because when I leave my stuff around, it is reminding you of when you were a child, and that you wanted to go out and have fun, or to be a kid, and I'm basically taking that away from you, by leaving my clutter in my messing around, that you have to go around and clean that up, so it reminds you of not a very fun time. 

01:34:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I can imagine that must make you feel. 

01:34:25
UNKNOWN I can imagine it must make you feel like you haven't grown up, or you haven't been able to play, so to speak. That you're constantly doing things for everybody else. And not been able to do anything for yourself. 

01:34:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that right? 

01:34:45
UNKNOWN Did I get that right? 

01:34:45
ANGIE Yes, you did. 

01:34:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, what could I do that would help heal all that? For you. 

01:34:55
UNKNOWN So what could I do that would help heal all that for you? 

01:35:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So now think about the frustration. And the behaviors that would remove the frustration for you. And think about three, don't have to think about three at once, but think about one, but we'll go to three, um, and state them in, uh specific, positive, behavioral, descriptive, quantitative terms. 

01:35:30
ANGIE Um, well one of the things I think you could do is, um- 

01:35:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Just make it as a request. 

01:35:30
ANGIE Uh, I would like you to complete a project from like, start to finish, put your tools away. Before you start another project. And, and just you know, put 'em back, put your tools back where you got 'em from. Not, leave 'em on the table so I have to move 'em five times a-, whatever, you know, I have to move 'em a lot. So, really, I just, I would like you to put your tools away. 

01:36:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so, summarize that again, when you have finished a project- 

01:36:10
ANGIE When you've, when you have finished a project, I would like you to put your tools away. 

01:36:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I'd like you to do that after you finish every project for how many months? Weeks, months, or years. 

01:36:20
ANGIE Um, I would li-, I would like you to do that, uh, after you finish every project for the next six weeks. 

01:36:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so let me see if I've got that right. 

01:36:35
UNKNOWN So lemme see if I've got that request. You'd like me to clean up my tools after, maybe not every project, but every day, because sometimes projects last longer than a day. But after every day, to pick up my tools, and put them away, for the next six weeks. Is that correct? 

01:36:50
ANGIE Um, I, I would like it to be, you know, at the end of the project, I don't expect it every day, because I do understand some projects go on. If I know that it's gonna be done at the end of the project, I can be okay with that. It's just that, once it's done, that it's not gonna sit there for six more weeks, and, until it's put away. 

01:37:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so let's work on this a bit. 'Cause it sounds like, could I try on a wish for you? It sounds like you're saying at the end of every project, uh, and we can put in a time line, for the next six months, I don't know how long projects run, uh, would you uh, put your tools away. Now also I'm thinking, that you might, this is just a fantasy, might want him to tell you when he starts the project. That I'm gonna start this project, when I finish, I'm gonna put my tools away, and then that he do that at the end of the project, and do that, for say the next three project. I'm making that up. Would that fit anything for you? 

01:37:55
ANGIE That, that would work, I'd also, would like, another possibility would be that if it's a big project, and if you need my help with uh, you know it's a, okay it's gonna take four days, but you know maybe we can keep it a little neater if you could help me do this. You know. 

01:38:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so maybe that could be a second request? Would that make sense? 

01:38:15
ANGIE That would work. 

01:38:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX The first one would work? Would the first one work for you as a request? 

01:38:20
ANGIE Yes. 

01:38:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay. So why don't we do one request at a time, and tell him again what the first one is. 

01:38:25
ANGIE Okay, um, I lost it. Uh, I would like for you to um, at the end of every project, to um, put your tools, clean up, and put everything away, and let me know that, that it's finished. That you know, I finished this project, it's completed, and now I can put everything away and move on. And I'd like you to do this for the next three months. So we have about three month's worth of projects. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN Let me get this straight. You would like me to pick up and clean up after my projects, and to let you know that when my projects are complete, so, that, it kinda puts a closure on everything, so that you know that I'm, I'm complete, and that I put all my tools away. 

01:39:25
ANGIE Yes. 

01:39:25
UNKNOWN Is that correct? 

01:39:25
ANGIE Yes. 

01:39:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX And my second request is, you may wanna restate the other one. 

01:39:30
ANGIE And my second request is that um, when you're starting a project, if you think that you're gonna need my help, you know, that you let me know. That, you know, this is, I, I'm gonna need some help with this cleanup. If it's something you can't do, that you requi-, ask for my assistance. Instead of leaving it. So that I ha-, I feel like I have to do it. So if you could ask for me to help you to clean up. That would be really nice. 

01:40:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Okay, so the second request. 

01:40:05
UNKNOWN The second request is that when I do start a project to let you know that if the project becomes large and I need to have some help cleaning up, or to let you know that I might need some help cleaning up, so that you can either help me, so that you don't feel like you have to clean up after all the projects. 

01:40:25
ANGIE Yeah. 

01:40:25
UNKNOWN Did I get that? 

01:40:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get that? 

01:40:25
ANGIE Yes. You got it. 

01:40:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, and your third request? 

01:40:35
ANGIE I don't know, I feel those are pretty good ones! 

01:40:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So just take it, just take a few seconds, and breathe, and um, let yourself be aware of your deepest wish around this issue. 

01:40:50
ANGIE Um, the third thing that-, that might help, is that if it-, if we are-, or we have some large projects we're doin' right now, that, um, maybe they can be done in stages. You know, that, that, a little bit better time planning, and management as far as, as uh, the completion of it, so that say it twelve tools, but you only need three of 'em at each stage, so it, maybe a little more system to it. So that, we don't have every tool out in the house at one time. We just have what we need out. 

01:41:30
UNKNOWN So let me see if I understand this correctly, that you'd like to have a little bit better planning as far as the length, and, and, uh, the amount of tools, or the tools needed to do different phases in a project that uh, I'm working on at any specific time. Is that correct? 

01:41:50
ANGIE Yes. 

01:41:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, now take a minute, and, um, sort of run those through your mind, and use this criteria, which one of these can I do, that will challenge me the most. I can do it, and it'll challenge me. It'll help me grow. And which one could I not do, so don't consider that one. Which one's the easiest, maybe let that one go. But the one that I can do that will challenge me the most. And then, state to her, uh, what you would give her as a gift. Either one, two, or three. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN I'll take, uh, door number three. Uh- 

01:42:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I wanna give you as a gift- 

01:42:35
UNKNOWN I'll give you as a gift, I will try to better plan my projects, and to a better time frame, and to try to do the projects in stages to where I don't have a total mess, and just take out the tools that I need for each individual phase. And try to do it in smaller chunks instead of tryin' to do in, a large project at one time. 

01:43:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So mirror that back, so the gift you're giving me. 

01:43:00
ANGIE Okay, the gift you're giving me is that, um, you will s-, take, uh, more time in planning your project, so that the, we don't have a lotta clutter, that all the tools aren't out at one time, and if it can be broken into stages, you'll break it up into stages, and keep the clutter at a minimum. 

01:43:25
UNKNOWN That's correct. 

01:43:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, say well, thank you for that, and then tell him how that would heal the childhood wound. 

01:43:35
ANGIE Um, thank you for that gift, and, um, it will help heal becau-, th-, th-, the child in me that feels that I have to take care of everything, that-, so I, it'll help me to not feel like I have to plan how we're gonna do it all. So it takes a little bit off of me, I guess. 

01:44:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that'll be different from my childhood- 

01:44:00
ANGIE And that, that'll be different from my childhood, when, you know, there was pretty much a list every day of all the things we had to do. So, it'll take a little bit away from that. 

01:44:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, that gift will- 

01:44:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX That gift will, I hope, uh, ease the tension that you have, in feeling that of having a list of, to have to clean everything every day, and to pick up my tools that I leave laying around because the project is not complete, and it will hopefully relieve some of the burden that you feel that you have to do. As far as my cleanup. 

01:44:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that'll help heal your childhood- 

01:44:45
UNKNOWN And that'll help heal your childhood to make me actually be more responsible for the things that I'm doing around the house, and not relying on you to be responsible, to pick up after me. 

01:44:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I wanna thank you for the request, because that will help me grow. Just try that on. 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN Uh, thank you for the request, it'll help me grow, and to helping me to better plan projects, and to take a little bit more responsibility on my part, and creating the clutter, and the mess in the house. 

01:45:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX You're welcome. 

01:45:25
ANGIE You're welcome, it feels good. 

01:45:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And at the end of a behavior change request process, it's, uh, useful, and connectional to make some sort of symbolic or ritual connection. Could be simple, like um, touching each other, hugging each other, having a laugh together, but some sort of coming together around having come to this point of mutual healing and growth. So what would you like to do to sort of connect at this point? 

01:45:55
UNKNOWN Give her a kiss. 

01:46:00
[sil.] 

01:46:00
Please Pause Here & Practice 

01:46:20
JON CARLSON Well I'd be interested in what this opportunity was like for you as couples. The behavior change requests. 

01:46:30
SIGH I thought it was fun, but I had problems coming up with three requests. Seemed to flow through the entire process, but when it came time for me to give her three behavior changes, I, one was you know, quite apparent, other two I had to reach for, but the third one I just, I struggled with coming up with the third request. 

01:46:50
JON CARLSON I was wonderin' about that too, why not just pick one? I mean start with, just with one? 

01:47:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Um, several reasons. One is, um, if you just leave it for one, many couples ask for things their partner can't do. So it makes it a failure experience. So we want three so that the partner can pick the easiest one. So this can be a winning experience. The reason it's really three, was a discovery. That the third one is always a creative one. Number one is A, number two is B, and they can be either-or, you know, it's like either do this or that, and either one would be okay, but what if I have to integrate that and that where's the mind stops, either to A or B. You know the brain seems to set up, to deal with polarities. But what if you can't deal with a polarity? What if you have to come up with something beyond the polarity. The third one, is most of the time, a creative alternative that goes above any of the other two options. 

01:47:50
JON CARLSON That's when you really go beyond and look at things differently. 

01:47:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

01:47:55
JON CARLSON And actively. 

01:47:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Right, there's an integrated synthesizing process is required. So that was a discovery, and therefore once I discovered that was happening, I built it as a requirement. 

01:48:05
PAT LOVE Also, I would imagine, for those of us who find it difficult to ask for anything, it would be an exercise in stretching and, and growth or developing my own character, and knowing that, gee, not only do I have to ask for one thing, I've gotta ask for three things. So I would think that that would be a part of that. 

01:48:25
UNKNOWN I just wanna say that maybe that would give you more confidence to ask for more, once you get through your first and second ones. 

01:48:30
PAT LOVE Good practice. 

01:48:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, and then maybe you could ask for a real tough one for your third one. 

01:48:35
PAT LOVE Well, you'd be on a roll! 

01:48:35
JON CARLSON What do you think of that, Frank? 

01:48:40
FRANK Well, I'm kinda glad she didn't. 

01:48:45
UNKNOWN You know, for me, I felt relieved to find that there was something I could do that would help the situation, and having the choices, it's like, well which one, 'cause you had mentioned, which one would be a bit of a challenge, and the last one, as you had just you know, signified, the last one was that I felt, it would be stretching, but it's attainable. So that's what I chose to do. 

01:49:05
PAT LOVE I loved your word attainable, because if they could see it's really important, even if you have to pick an easier one, to pick one you absolutely know you can do, there's no question in your mind. Because we're gonna, you're programming yourselves for success. And gifting. Instead of, but you said I knew it was attainable, it was a stretch, but I knew it was attainable. 

01:49:25
UNKNOWN One of the things that I find that sometimes I discount is when I have to tell him what I want, or what I need, and then, when I get it, I'd like, discount it, because I was forced to ask. One of the things I thought was neat about it was when he came back, or when I went back to him, and said, I'd like to give this to you as a gift. That is the neatest thing, because it, it takes that discount outta there. 

01:49:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Right. 

01:49:55
UNKNOWN It takes that disc-, it took that discount out for me. Ya know, all of a sudden, now I wasn't asking for it, he was givin' it to me as a gift. That was really cool. 

01:50:10
PAT LOVE Back in my mind-reading days, I used to even shoot myself in the foot by saying something uh, as immature as, well, if I have to ask, just forget it. It's like, talk about self-inflicted wound. You know, somehow making up that he would know my mind. So I was relating when you said that. 

01:50:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. And, and me too. What, and what, uh, what that reflects is the residue of infancy. Where, there is a sense, on the part of a child, that parents has to intuit what the child needs. And the child doesn't have to become cognitive or conscious of that. And, when that's transferred into a adult relationship, it then becomes very, very painful for both people involved, because nobody on earth can read your mind. And, you need to learn to, and you need to get in touch with what you want, and ask for it, that's what an adult does. And, but most of us are real-, still stuck. With some residual childhood, uh, psychologies. And also with some training. 

01:51:10
JON CARLSON Makes a lotta sense to me. 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN I was just gonna say what the, uh, um, giving the three actions, I thought that was very helpful, in that for myself personally, sometimes I'll wanna see a change in behavior, but I'm not sure how I want that change to happen. 

01:51:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yes. 

01:51:30
UNKNOWN So- 

01:51:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Just change, damnit. Yes. 

01:51:35
UNKNOWN Really! Yeah, really. And then when you say, um, in essence, you know, what is it that you want me to do, whoa, you know, you kinda are taken aback by, and you have to rethink what it is you really want to change. And give it some real, some real concrete verbal statement. And, um, I thought that was really very beneficial. For our relationship to be able to say, um, not only this is what I need changed, but this is how I need to see it change. So I thought that was very helpful. 

01:52:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the specificity was helpful for you. 

01:52:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:52:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX I want this three times a day for four weeks, standing on one leg. 

01:52:20
UNKNOWN But I always remember thinking about, not only that I'm right, a lot of the time, but what I'm bringing to the, the discussion, or the argument, whatever, was, all the good things that I'm trying to do, this has helped me to become more aware of the things that I'm pre-, that I'm doing to prevent the-, the communication from happening. The things that I do that get in the way. 

01:52:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX You're a winner. That's a transcendent awareness. 

01:52:50
UNKNOWN Wow, feels good to me. 

01:52:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Godlike. It's wonderful to discover how you prevent yourself from being in relationship, to even ask that question, is a transcendent, uh, state of consciousness. You're already almost into the kingdom. 

01:53:15
UNKNOWN Yo, God. 

01:53:15
JON CARLSON Oh wow. And, uh, you have to live with him! 

01:53:25
UNKNOWN How are ya, Dr. Spock? 

01:53:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, so thank you for sharing that. 'Cause I think until you can have that awareness, you really can't change. 

01:53:35
PAT LOVE That is a ma-, that's the consciousness that I believe you were talk- 

01:53:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX That's it, that's it. 

01:53:40
PAT LOVE That's conscious communica-, uh oh. I'm part of this. It's like, ah ha. 

01:53:45
ANGIE I really like the idea of the gift-, giving the gift of, you know, picking what-, because for me it wa-, what I found myself wanting to do after that, was appreciating the gift so much, that I wanted to like, turn and say okay, tell me your frustration, because I wanna be able to give you the same gift. I wanted to turn around and give it back to him. 

01:54:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Wow, wow. 

01:54:05
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

01:54:05
ANGIE You know, you've done this for me, what can I do for you. 

01:54:10
PAT LOVE And that's the energy that starts to flow, because gifting comes out of fullness. And it-, it's natural to be altruistic when you're feeling full. It's just an overflowing, and that's what, the beautiful part that starts feed-, you know, the energy between you, starts creating synergy. Then you-, there literally is more to the two of you. 

01:54:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And that thing Pat is doing is the Imago logo. Which is the infinity circle, as a circle in the middle, and two two circles on each end. And then the energy runs through those three circles. Through each person and into the, then into the relationship. Thank you for doing that, and this. It's the infinity symbol. 

01:54:50
JON CARLSON I gotta get with this stuff, you guys are just, you know- 

01:54:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX With this grooving. 

01:54:50
JON CARLSON Yeah, all this hand stuff, yeah- 

01:54:55
PAT LOVE And it's limitless. 

01:54:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX It's limitless, yes. 

01:55:00
JON CARLSON Well thank you all, this was a wonderful experience, I wanna thank Harville for being here with us and helping to bring communications to this level of consciousness. Thank you Harville.
