DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) What might limit your ability to be effective in your interactions with others? Well, if you are like most people you react to different types of people in different ways. You probably find yourself feeling at ease and comfortable with some people, but uncomfortable, tense and even anxious around others. You might find that your comfort level changes suddenly when certain kinds of issues come up. This could mean that we are less effective in dealing with this issues. The most limiting of all, however, are those situations or people who affect us strongly. In these situations we are unaware or at least not fully aware of what's happening, and how these situations or people are affecting our ability to be effective. Consider this. Effective Communication Skills will usually facilitate more open and honest interactions. Generally, people will be freer in sharing their thoughts and feelings with you. If you are like most of us, however, there are content areas and emotions you, yourself are uncomfortable with and would prefer to avoid. So if using the skills we have taught resulting your experiencing uncomfortable or painful or frightening feelings. What are you likely to do? You stop using the skills, yet who could blame you, but if we can help you become a bit more comfortable with the various topics and emotions that may come up between you and other people, if we can help you be better at staying with the topic and the emotion, then, there is a good chance you will become more comfortable and better at listening to and helping others. This next unit entitled affects simulation, is designed to help you better understand and deal with at least some of your more stressful reactions to situations and certain types of people, what Doctor Kagan referred to in the introductory film, as our interpersonal allergies to others. You may remember that interpersonal allergies were described essentially as powerful, automatic, knee-jerk adverse reactions to others. In describing this adverse reactions Doctor Kagan outlined the bottom line fears that we have had in one form or another most of our lives. You will hurt me, I will hurt you, you will engulf me, I will engulf you. The nature of this uncomfortable emotion seem to be very primitive, almost childlike in nature and were learned in childhood when we were small people, in a big persons world. The fascinating thing is that even when we know this fears are not based in reality, they still provoke powerful emotional reactions in us. In IPR sessions many of the concerns held by people are often express as, I know this doesn't make sense but I felt like I was going to be picked up and hurt or that somehow, the other person would walk out, abandon me and I wouldn't be able to survive on my own. Remember the first fear? You will hurt me. And other concern participants mentioned when viewing the vignettes was that some of the people on film seem so vulnerable, they said things like, " I was afraid I would hurt them," "Some of them actually made me angry, but I was afraid that if I didn't hide my anger I would hurt them somehow, and it would be all my fault." The second fear, "I will hurt you." In addition to the fears of you will hurt me and I will hurt you, past participants in IPR recall sessions had concerns about intimacy, sexuality, affection and stickiness, they would say things like, "I was leery of allowing that person to get to know me to well or to get to close or to let them get there way, like if that were to happen I would loss my identity, my separateness or my autonomy. The third fear, "You will engulf me." Our foremost concern voiced by participants, was that they would somehow be tempted to use the other for their own sexual curiosity, or intimacy needs like, "I might engulf them." These four bottom line fears formed the guidelines for creating the vignettes. See if these fears characterize any of your reactions to the different scenes. In this unit you will view a wide range of people in many different settings. Your task is to become aware of how you are affected by each vignette. The most important thing is to pretend that you are completely alone with the person on the screen and allow the vignettes to have an impact on you. Become aware of what emotion, thought or bodily reaction you experience. After each vignette, the instructor will stop the tape. You will be given a chance to think about and discuss your experience of the scene. Remember the purpose of this work is to help you become more effective in all your interpersonal interactions including those in which you feel specially uncomfortable or those you would ordinarily avoid ever getting into. As you view the vignettes keep these questions in mind; What did I feel? What did I think? What were my bodily reactions? When else in my life do I feel that way? What would I probably do? What would I really want to do? What did I think the person talking was feeling about me? What made him think that he could talk to me that way? That is, what did he see in me or think he saw in me that gave him the right? What did they think he or she really wanted me to do or really wanted to make me feel? Now, try to apply this exploratory probes to yourself as you watch each vignette. After you have worked with a few of the scenes, your instructor has chosen, we will tell you more about the use of this unit? 

00:07:10
  I know I can trust you to do what's right. I know you wouldn't do anything that I wouldn't approve off, I know I can trust you. 

00:07:30
 There are several basic ways in which the simulation exercises are usually used. The first thing to do is to view the stimulus vignettes as a group and share your reactions with your colleagues. This format allows you to learn that the variety of different reactions occur to the same stimulus, that people do indeed respond differently. Listening to your colleagues may also help you better identify and label your own reactions to a certain or the stimulated encounters. In other format permits a continuation of the sharing process but also allows for sub skill development. You are asked to form groups of four or five. One member of each group is ask to serve as facilitator. The vignette is played and the group facilitator leads the discussion. Other vignettes are shown so that each member of the group can have an opportunity to be the facilitator. Another format permits you to examine your reactions as well as to practice listening and responding to each other. You will be asked to form pairs, one person in each pair leaves the room while the Vignette is played. Upon their return, they listen too and explore their partners reactions to the scene. Another format involves the use of simultaneous video recording. As we watch the vignettes, you are video recorded, videotape played back, can then facilitate your recall of the impact the vignette had on you. You can see yourself, hear the voice of the actors and actresses and stop the videotape whenever you remember any thoughts or feelings that you were having. This format also serves as an introduction to the video equipment and to seeing yourself on the tape. Another approach is for you to watch the vignette and for videotape cameras to record not only your image but you physiological responses as well. You can then observe the videotape play back of what you're look like while also watching the recording of what your heart rate, sweat rate, breathing or other processes where at any moment. In one variation we can even record your current ongoing physiology, as we review the video played back with you. Your instructor will determine which of these formats will be used to get the most out of this experience try to forget about the surroundings you are currently in, and pretend that you are completely alone with the person on the screen. Don't rush, allow ample time to think about the meaning each vignette has had for you, and to share the impact with your colleagues. For most of you this is not a difficult task, but it does require that you use some effort and some imagination. In your mind let the person on the screen take you where they will, then ask yourself, "What are the dangers about such a journey? What assumptions do you make about your ability to cope with this dangers? Questions you might ask yourself are: What are my typical or most frequent emotional reactions? What would happen if I change, that this, if I stop being angry or guilty? What would I replace it with? What would my thoughts be like if I gave up anger, guilt, shame or fear. Our emotional expectations organized the world in a funny kind of way, don't they? Be aware also that just as language has subtle meanings so to emotions have overtones and other emotions are hidden within emotions. For example: Guilt turns to anger but sometimes covers over fear, and serves to protect us from anxiety. Well, then, as you go through this the most important thing is to allow your emotions to develop. Allow the person you are watching to have an impact on you. After each vignette your instructor has chosen you will be ask to talk about your reactions. Again, keep these questions in mind; What did they feel? What did I think? What were my bodily reactions? When else in my life do I feel that way? What would I probably do? What would I really want to do? What did I think the person talking was feeling about to me? What made him think that he could talk to me that way? What did he see in me or think he saw in me that gave him the right? What did I think he or she really wanted me to do or really wanted to make me feel?

  Well, we do need people to tell him, uhm, of course, if you have something else to do, ah, it gotta be alright too, but, I think we do need people to come.

00:16:05
  No one, is going to tell you, not to believe what you honestly believe. But I want you to re-examine the things that you believe, because most of us could not feel the way you do about things. Now, I want you to think about it, okay? Just think about it. 

00:16:45

00:16:45

00:17:50
  Oh, I, I don't really know how to say this because I, I've never said this to anyone before but, and you just turn me on. And if you don't come over here and touch me, I'm going to go out of my mind. 

00:18:25
9 

00:18:25
  You know, you really make me feel very, very special. I really, I look forward to, to having this time with you and that just being able to let the whole day melt away. I'm really glad your my friend, you really mean a lot to me, you really do. 

00:19:10

00:19:10
  I want you to settle down, and do the kind of job we both know your capable of. 

00:19:25
11 

00:19:25
  Your work has been excellent, the feed back, I knew has been terrific but unfortunately, we've had budget cuts, we're going to have to let you go. 

00:19:45
12 

00:19:45
  The reason I wanted you to stop by is ah, we've gotten into a bad situation. We just got a phone call, a little Snyder(ph) boy, his father was just in a car accident, killed instantly. I, I, I think it's best if you tell him. 

00:20:15
13 

00:20:15
  So, you got everything you want out of me and now you're going to throw me out. Now, that I'm old, after all I've given you. All I've done for you. You're gonna toss me out on the junk heap, you son of a bitch. 

00:20:45
14 

00:20:45
  Don't tell me about your day, you just wait until you hear what I had to put up with. A dog threw up all over the kitchen floor this morning, and then the washing machine went on the blink, you know, what? I called a repair man. The first thing he did, was to track mud all over the living room rug, and that washing machine still doesn't work. He had to send out the parts and who knows how long that's gonna take. And then, Tom's teacher called, he's in trouble at school again, those kids I just. 

00:21:15
15 

00:21:15
  I really like you. I really like being with you, uhm. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:40
 (titters) Do you have, do you have any idea what you do to me? I just wanna touch you, I just wanna reach out, and feel your warmth. I wanna smell you just like animals. 

00:22:15
16 

00:22:15
  What's the matter? Taken on more than you can handle? You know, over your head? Well, shit, grow up. 

00:22:50
17 

00:22:50
  What in the hell are you looking at. 

00:23:15
18 

00:23:15
  Why don't you let me be the fool of myself? 

00:23:30
[sil.] 

00:23:30
  Why? 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:35
  Why? 

00:23:40
19 

00:23:40
  (laughing) I could turn you on. I could really turn you on. (laughing) 

00:24:15
20 

00:24:15
  All right, I took your advice, your advice. Now, look at the mess I am in. Thank's a lot. 

00:24:45
21 

00:24:45
 (laughing) You are so fine. Well, just look at yourself sitting there. I, I mean, you don't take yourself seriously, do you? 

00:25:20
22 

00:25:20
  What do you think? You're in trouble, you're in real trouble. 

00:25:45
23 

00:25:45
  I don't know how to really say this to someone, ah, right across the table but, uhm, I don't like you very much. I don't want to do this but, you make me feel uncomfortable. Ah, nothing personal, you know, but I just don't like being around you. 

00:26:20
24 

00:26:20
  Can you give me a minute, something has been driving me frantic, for the last few years I've found myself thinking about little children, wanting to touch them, but I shouldn't. I know it's wrong, I know it's evil, I know it's unnatural, but I can't help myself. Please help me. You've got to help me. 

00:27:05
25 

00:27:05
  You know, what? You, you look better with your cloths on than off. 

00:27:25
26 

00:27:25
  I don't wanna talk to you. Just stay away. Just stay away! Just stay away! 

00:27:45
27 

00:27:45
  Are you in charge? Are you really in charge? Oh, my God hmm. 

00:28:05
28 

00:28:05
  Well, ah, I'd love too, but uhm. Well, it's just that I've been so busy lately and uhm, well, I've just been up to my eyebrows and work really I, uh, maybe some other time? 

00:28:35
29 

00:28:35
  You want me to level with you? All right, I'll level with you. Your just a slob, a goddamn slob. 

00:28:55
30 

00:28:55
  If only you people would stay in your place, there wouldn't be so much trouble around here. 

00:29:15
31 

00:29:15
  What, what are you? I mean, what, what's your background? Oh, you know what I mean. Ah, what are you? 

00:29:35
32 

00:29:35
  I've listened to you and I would like you to know that I don't like your ideas, one god damn bit. I think it's you and people like you that cause most of the misery, we have around us. And I'd like to go right over there and just bring your fucking teeth down your throat. 

00:30:20
33 

00:30:20
  Oh, your the doctor? Your so young, could I see someone, uhm, just a little older? 

00:30:55
34 

00:30:55
  The tests are in, ah, I don't have cancer, do I? I, I don't, I don't have cancer, do I? 

00:31:15
35 

00:31:15
  We've been to so many doctors who are just awful. But I'm sure you will be able to help us. 

00:31:45
36 

00:31:45
  You wanna talk to me? I don't wanna talk to you. I don't wanna talk to you! Leave me alone! Get away from me! Leave me alone! No, I don't wanna talk! No, leave me alone! No! (crying). 

00:32:15
37 

00:32:15
  This is very hard for me. This is hard for me to talk about, even that they think about, I feel that, oh God(ph)! 

00:32:45
38 

00:32:45
  Well, the student evaluations are in. How many years have you been teaching? 

00:33:10
39 

00:33:10
  Ah, I just wanted to come in and see you, and I wanted to tell you that, ah. Well, you're my favorite teacher. 

00:33:40
40 

00:33:40
  Huh, well, I tried so many things you suggested, but it was just as bored as ever. They laughed. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:10
  They laughed at me. Those sons of bitches laughed! 

00:34:20
41 

00:34:20
  You're a good teacher, but do you know Smith in English? Her classes are just great! I just love them. They're so enjoyable and, and so interesting. Your classes are good too. I really liked them. 

00:34:45
42 

00:34:45
  There was a time in this place when you could get away with that kind of stuff, huh, but not anymore. 

00:35:00
43 

00:35:00
 I've read your report it has some merit, really this isn't the final version, is it? Well, anyway I want you to redo it. 

00:35:25
44 

00:35:25
  You know, things have gone along very nicely for a very long time. Are you sure you don't want change? Just so that you can tell yourself you're different? 

00:35:50
DR.HENYA KAGAN Did you find that certain of the scenes were more difficult to get involved with than others? I wonder why? Isn't that fascinating that having been asked to pretend that you are alone with the person on the screen. For certain vignettes you are unable to do so. What do you suppose these means, poor acting? Or do you think something else might be going on. Possibly something to do with our reluctance to involve ourselves with certain types of people or situations? What do you think? Can looking at this potentially stressful interpersonal interactions help us overcome our fears? And if so how? Well as Doctor Kagan, said before. Finding labels or words to express what was previously vague thoughts or pre-language feelings helps us know ourselves better through language. We may literally be informing one part of the brain about the content of another. Transforming our fears or reactions into words makes them more manageable and less frightening. Again, the ferocious wolf on close examination is found to be very old and toothless. If you had to create a vignette, which would help you look at some of your own worst interpersonal nightmares, what would you create for yourself? If this unit has been useful to you, you will probably find that; You are less frightened or uncomfortable in what are usually difficult interpersonal situations for you. You have more awareness of the types of interactions that are specially difficult for you. You have learned to debrief yourself and others who have been the recipient of a stressful interpersonal encounter. You will have listened to others describe their reaction to this difficult situations and become aware of how we all can experience the same interpersonal encounter in very different ways. They should keep you from forming erroneous conclusions about how someone is thinking in the future.
