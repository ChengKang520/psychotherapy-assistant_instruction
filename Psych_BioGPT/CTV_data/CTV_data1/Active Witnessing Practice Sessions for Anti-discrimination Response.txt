I don't feel the way you do about children leaving home. My parents don't feel the way your parents do either." To this, Ashley interrupts Manuel by saying. 

00:02:45
ASHLEY  We're talking about ordinary people, you know. The people who grew up in this country, in a normal social environment. Maybe, you can learn something about our traditions by listening to our discussion instead of interrupting us.

  There are two bank machines, but one of them is out of order. An elderly man is trying to withdraw a cash. He keeps making mistakes in punching in numbers with his trembling finger. Also, his walking stick keeps falling on the floor even though he tries to lean it up against the bank machine. It takes a long time for him to pick up the cane from the floor and get back to his attempt to punch in the right number. There is a small lineup behind him. He is embarrassed and apologetic toward the people behind him. Lily and Joe have been waiting in line for the last five minutes and getting increasingly impatient. Lily whispers.

Sam turns to his male colleagues and says. 

00:22:35
SAM You know, I'm quite impressed with the new store manager. She looked at the circuit panel and said that we needed to replace the old breaker switches with higher capacity ones. Then an electrician came and said the exact same thing. For a woman, she's very good at fixing things.

They are surprised to learn that it's a woman in a wheelchair who is a visible minority member and speaks with a slight ethnic accent. They are told that she has an excellent reputation and solid administrative experience. After giving a short speech and shaking hands with everyone, she leaves. The workers gather and start talking about their impression. One of them whispers to several co-workers. 

00:24:55
HARRY Let's suppose of being a woman and being ethnic really helps in career progress in this era of employment equity. In her case, being in a wheelchair must have been an added bonus to help her get the position.

00:32:05
LYN SHACKLETON It's a Chinese kid. No wonder my daughter is doing so badly. Her partner is not Canadian. The kid probably doesn't even speak our language properly. Oh, Gordon? We have to deal with this.

DELIA DOMINACK (inaudible ) You know, there's gonna be a lot of people at this party. 

00:33:00
PEARL CHUANG (inaudible )? Who should we invite to Maya's get together? 

00:33:05
DELIA DOMINACK Hmm. 

00:33:05
PEARL CHUANG Do we want to invite the entire staff? I mean we're talking like 15 people in my tiny apartment. 

00:33:10
DELIA DOMINACK Well, I consider Maya a friend, not really a co-worker. After all, are we organizing a party? Let's just invite our friends. I can make molle(ph) and tres leches cake. Huh. Remember when you and Yoshi came over? 

00:33:30
PEARL CHUANG Of course, Yoshi. 

00:33:30
DELIA DOMINACK  Besides I wouldn't know what to cook for them. That blonde western food, huh, and I hate I have to deal with all those comments about my food being too spicy and exotic. You know what white people are alike. They only care to know about us in what they read in travel magazines. You know what I mean.

MICHAEL BELWOOD  Welcome back. You're listening to CKYY radio. All talk, all the time. The time is nine o' clock and it's a balmy 16 degrees outside of the studio. Our topic tonight for those of you just joining us is a controversial subject of welfare fraud. We've read about it, heard about it. Everyone's got an opinion. What's yours? Call us at 255-2727 and let us know what's your beef. Oh, I see we have a caller. So, I'll stop stealing the spotlight. Caller you're on the air. 

00:35:00
LAYDA GONGORA If we deported those new immigrants that come to Canada and soon go on welfare, we wouldn't have a problem. We could give money to our own people who deserve it. 

00:35:10
MICHAEL BELWOOD It seems not all our callers can have informed opinions. I just like to point out that according to statistics, new immigrants had come for only a small portion of welfare fraud cases. 

00:35:20
LAYDA GONGORA Oh, but those packies, they're not dumb, you know. They know the system, they're sneaky enough to cheat it. Huh(ph), I don't believe your statistics. 

00:35:30
MICHAEL BELWOOD Thanks for that opinion. I think it's time for some more music. I'd like to play you one of my favorites.

DELIA DOMINACK  It's been so great living in tonight(ph) Janis. Thanks for the lovely dinner. 

00:36:10
JANIS SUESS Yes, finally I can put a face to the voice I've heard for so long now. I make a point in meeting all Megan's good friends and, anyway, you guys are roommates. Megan, would you like some of the leftovers, I'll never finish them? 

00:36:20
MEGAN FERGUSSON  Mom, it, that's all right. We've got lots of our own leftovers back at the apartment. 

00:36:25
JANIS SUESS I know, but I'll never finish them. Just hold on a second, I'll go get them. 

00:36:30
DELIA DOMINACK Roommates? Roommates? I thought she knew. 

00:36:35
MEGAN FERGUSSON She does. Just give her some time. It's, it's awkward for everyone. 

00:36:40
DELIA DOMINACK  I'll wait for you in the car. 

00:36:45
MEGAN FERGUSSON Mom, what is this milk? 

00:36:50
JANIS SUESS You guys are so busy and anyway, I've got too much. She doesn't look like what I expected. 

00:36:55
MEGAN FERGUSSON  Why? Is because she's not white? 

00:37:00
JANIS SUESS Oh, come on Megan. I don't know, I just thought her hair might be shorter, no make-up. That sort of thing. 

00:37:05
MEGAN FERGUSSON What, she doesn't look gay enough? Come on mom, get over it.
