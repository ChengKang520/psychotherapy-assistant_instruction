Assertiveness Training: Developing an Action Story for Sexual Harassment Norma Gluckstern with Kathryn Bohn This is a follow-up from the Basic Listening Sequence Demonstration. The Five-stage interview adapted to assertiveness training is presented in a brief demonstration. Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring "Hello" 

00:00:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kathryn, I received a call from Dr. Ivey and he told me that ah, you are coming here for some assertiveness training to the women's center. He briefed, briefed me a little bit on the facts that ah, you've made a decision not to take any legal action against your boss but, but rather be able to talk to him about what he had done and how you felt about it. And so maybe I can give you a little bit ah, of a background, that one of the things that we're going to do here today is role play. I just want to know if you're comfortable, if you even know what role play means? 

00:00:45
KATHRYN BOHN  I think it would help if you explain it just a little bit more for me. 

00:00:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well in role-playing, I'm going to at sometime either play the part of your boss or maybe play your part... (crosstalk) 

00:00:55
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:00:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and then I'm gonna ask you to do like sort of, a, actually it's kinda of experiencing rather than just talking about the action. 

00:01:05
KATHRYN BOHN Okay, good. 

00:01:05
For demonstration purpose, Stage 1 has been made deliberately brief. Be sure you develop a working relationship with your client before moving on to Stage 2. Stage 2: Gathering information, defining the problem and identifying assets "What's your concern?" 

00:01:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  But before I do that, I wonder if you might give me a little bit background about exactly what happened and why, where in this point? 

00:01:20
KATHRYN BOHN  Well, uhm, it was a situation a couple of weeks ago now and I was, uhm, not confronted if you will but I was at the elevator waiting to ah, go for a run and boss just happened to be walking by and stopped and noticed I was in shorts and certainly that was different than office attire, and I've, ah, he said, "Wow, what great legs you have. I mean, It was so long and strong and lean and, well I wish my girlfriend have, could have legs like that." 

00:01:50
Kathryn's story 

00:01:50
KATHRYN BOHN  And I just was like, "Oh well, you know I, I guess you know but, you know well, you know I tried to keep in shape" for it, like almost making me feel kind of self-conscious. (crosstalk) 

00:02:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:02:05
KATHRYN BOHN And all of a sudden like you know, and then I apologized quickly for being in this attire. You know I said, "Well, you know I'm doing for one normally, I wouldn't be like dressed like this." "No, you look great I just love it, you know," and just kept on going on and uhm, I, I, I just and, and, and to talked about the detail and on top of that I mean, he was with a client there as well and I felt another male, you know, a gentleman and I just felt really like what if this other gentleman, you know, in a situation. What if I'm in the meeting with him next week? And all he's gonna think about is what this guy said about my legs and I'm not gonna have any sense of self or, or I'm not gonna feel empowered to be who I am or... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So I... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
KATHRYN BOHN ...who I wanna be. 

00:02:45
Reflection of feeling, confrontation 

00:02:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...So I hear you saying is ah, one level you felt very apologetic. He made you feel almost small and that took your professionalism away. You wouldn't comment on how he looked in the suit. (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
KATHRYN BOHN No. 

00:02:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And that made you feeling that you weren't going to be as effective actually when you work... (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. 

00:03:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and the other part is that you really are angry. 

00:03:00
KATHRYN BOHN I, I think I am, I think because it maybe, because I haven't said anything, uhm, you know, as of yet. And decide not to take legal action but, but because I haven't said anything and because I feel he shouldn't, he shouldn't be doing that, you know, he shouldn't be saying those things to me. 

00:03:15
Open question 

00:03:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uhm, one thing I want to ask you is, how do you feel about, ah, not taking legal action but actually being able to, to confront him, I say from the issue, how does that make you feel? Are you. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
KATHRYN BOHN  Well, I feel very, uhm, I mean, I almost feel, I feel strong about it, (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:03:30
KATHRYN BOHN uhm, I feel good about the decision, uhm, I feel that if, uhm, I think it's okay to take legal action, I think it's right in some situations but my situation I need to really gain an inner strength about myself and, and learn to work with him again and in the future and, and by doing that I need to, I need to talk to him and I need to be strong about myself first before anything. I mean, who knows? Maybe down the line but right now I need some work on how I interact with him and, and, and finding strength in myself to go on with this. 

00:04:05
Role-play concretize the story 

00:04:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  All right and the first thing we're gonna do and I think it might help and it will help me as well as you, is sort of role-play. 

00:04:15
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:04:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And what I thought I would like to do if it's comfortable with you is I'll role-play your boss. 

00:04:20
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:04:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And, ah, but you, but what we're really trying to do is that how are you gonna react and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:04:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and that's would be the first step. See your behavior and how you're gonna react and I'll be... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:04:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...playing your boss. Ah, what's his name by the way? 

00:04:30
KATHRYN BOHN What's his name? John. 

00:04:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay, then, then I'm, so I'm John, is there something you might tell me about John that might help me role play more realistically? 

00:04:40
KATHRYN BOHN  Uhm, he's, well I mean I can, ah, I think he's, he's very opinionated, uhm, uhm, he's very strong willed, uhm, he's very knowledgeable, very bright, very, very intellectual and sometimes, uhm, often disengaging. 

00:05:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Kathryn I'm gonna role play John now and what I want you to do is, is pretty much act the way you would normally in this interaction that you had with him on the elevator. So, we're on the elevator now and I say, "Wow, Kathryn you look pretty good, ah, those are some legs you have." 

00:05:20
KATHRYN BOHN Yup, ah, well you know, I try to work out quite a bit, uhm, and you know, stay in shape, it's important to me. 

00:05:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I just wish my girlfriend had legs like that, ah, just really something else. Hey, by the way you, you know Bill? He's one of your clients, isn't he? Aren't those great legs? 

00:05:45
Note speech hesitations and nonverbals 

00:05:45
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, yeah, like I said I mean it's, it's important for me to, to, uhm, you know stay healthy I, you know I, I, you know I wanna keep everything in moderation though and, and just, uhm, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN You know on Friday we have that day that you don't have to come all dressed, you ought to come looking like that when you come on the job and, ah, instead of bringing those slacks that you wear or, or the jeans. I think you're always wearing jeans, aren't you? 

00:06:05
KATHRYN BOHN Well, you know, I mean, it is kinda fall weather now but, but, uhm, yeah, I don't, no, I mean I, I don't know, I mean I, I like jeans, I, I'm comfortable in them. You know my office is kinda, kinda cool a little bit this days. 

00:06:20
Role plays clarify stories and behavior is observed directly Important to focus on feelings first 

00:06:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, Kathryn. Let's talk about how you're feeling right now. 

00:06:25
The story takes on immediacy 

00:06:25
KATHRYN BOHN  Uhm, God, I mean talk about flashback. Uhm, well first of all, you play a good John (laughs) and, uhm, but I mean everything from that day was, was, was just, just came right back. I mean he, you know the situation with the client, you know with, with continuing to comment on my legs, to, to, to bringing his girlfriend. I mean I just, it, I just, ah, I don't, I don't know. 

00:06:55
Stage 3: Determining Outcomes "What do you want to happen here?" 

00:06:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, well, let me share with you what I was observing and maybe this is the first step in assertiveness training, (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:07:05
Feedback on concrete story 

00:07:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Is that when I started talking the first that you did is you're looking down. You never once looked at me, with that I'm seeing no eye contact. And that was... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...almost like you were shrinking, I could see you shrinking, I could see you shrinking in that elevator. The other thing I watched is maybe you weren't conscious but it was almost like you were pulling your dress down, you rub it above your hands on... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...on your legs as if you were trying to hide. 

00:07:30
Behavioral instruction toward a new story 

00:07:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so one of the things that I think is really very important, a couple is that you begin, if, if you're gonna be assertive... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...as, and not only at women there's men but men I think, have an easier time one is eye contact. 

00:07:40
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:07:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Is when I can look at you if, if I look down what, what, how do I look when I'm looking down? 

00:07:45
KATHRYN BOHN Hmm. A little kind of, like maybe, uhm, you know like a little child, like embarrassed. 

00:07:55
Encourage, positive strength 

00:07:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Very good, very, very good. 

00:07:55
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, you know like, like a little girl not... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well... (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
KATHRYN BOHN ...not. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Even like that there like a little girl. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:08:00
Behavioral instruction 

00:08:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. So, one of the first thing is the eye contact. The other is also how you physically hold yourself I mean, it's this sort of, the, in, in communicating, it's not only, it's, it's visual... (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...it's also nonverbal. So one of your nonverbals is in fact, you know, sort of like this. 

00:08:15
Open question to involve client 

00:08:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Kind of, how does that look when I'm pulling my skirt down like that? 

00:08:20
KATHRYN BOHN You're conscious of something, like, like, or, or self conscious about something that, some things, I mean, I don't know maybe, I don't know I don't think it's bad though, I mean what, what, what is. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
Feedback 

00:08:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN But I think your, I think one of those things that, that you worry about being very self conscious. 

00:08:35
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:08:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so you should be somewhat conscious of how you're sitting, how are your hands, are they relaxed? And so I think these are two important things. 

00:08:40
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:08:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, let's sort of take a breathe now and kinda digest these things. 

00:08:45
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:08:45
Stage 3 Continued: Identifying goals for a new story after a short break 

00:08:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay, Kathryn. I think that you, we did have a good start talking about the nonverbals and how you're gonna come in to, what I'd like to do is talk about how you gonna come into the office. I've identified a couple of things for you, let me see how you can, now, you role play. 

00:09:05
KATHRYN BOHN So I'm, I'm, I'm myself? (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're coming in here, you're yourself but... 

00:09:10
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:09:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...you're coming in the office. I, I'm sitting behind my desk. 

00:09:10
KATHRYN BOHN Okay, and your John? Okay. 

00:09:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I'm John. 

00:09:15
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. Uhm, well maybe it's something I'm, I'm bringing him some work that I... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay. 

00:09:20
KATHRYN BOHN ...uhm, bringing you some work to show you that I've, I've done some work for you, and you have to take a look at it. And, uhm, I'm just talking to you and I'm showing you things and I'm, I'm looking at you. Uhm, I, uhm, my hands are not down at my body here but maybe down at my side or maybe they're just, there, there's, there's little stronger looking, uhm, they're not, ah, ah, touching my clothing or around it and, and conscious of what I'm wearing or how I'm looking. 

00:09:50
Kathryn has just summarized her behavioral goals for a new story. It takes longer in a real session-the client needs to internalize goals to ensure behavioral transfer. Let us listen to Kathryn's internalized goals again. 

00:09:50
KATHRYN BOHN  Well, maybe it's something I'm, I'm bringing him some work that I... (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:10:05
KATHRYN BOHN ...uhm, bringing you some work to show you that I, I've done some work for you and you have to take a look at it. And, uhm, I'm just talking to you and I'm showing you things and I'm, I'm looking at you, uhm, I, uhm, my hands are not down at my body here. But maybe down at my side or maybe they're just, there, there's, there's a little stronger-looking. Uhm, they're not touching my clothing or around it and, and conscious of what I'm wearing or how I'm looking. 

00:10:35
Goals are pushed a bit farther 

00:10:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN That's very good, but, with, what was interesting is you're talking about coming to the office and bringing him some work. And I'm talking about coming in the office and talking to him about what happened with your legs. So how are you gonna go about doing that? We've got the eye contact, we've got the, ah, nonverbals fairly comfortable. How are you going, what are you going to say to him? 

00:10:55
Stage 4: Exploring alternatives and Confronting incongruity "What are we going to do about it?" 

00:10:55
KATHRYN BOHN  I, I think I need to, ah, say you know, "John, can I have a few minutes of your time? Uhm, I need to have a conversation with you," uhm, and, you know, I, I suspect he'll, I, you know, I hope you'll say yes, you know, "Please sit down." Uhm, although I don't know- 

00:11:15
Clear, behavioral goals vital for story action 

00:11:15
KATHRYN BOHN - ah, maybe I will close the door, uhm, uhm, and I'll sit down and, and I'm gonna sit back a little bit. And, and I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna act like I care but same time, I'm not right in there, with my shoulders back, showing a, showing a little, little strength, maybe? Is that, what you think? (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, one of the things that I heard when you first started is you said, "John, can I have a little bit of your time?" But that, is that what you really want, is a little bit of time? What, what might be a more assertive or, way of verbalizing what you're saying? 

00:11:50
KATHRYN BOHN John, we need to talk about something. 

00:11:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:11:55
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. (laughs)Uhm, John, we need to talk about something and I think it would be only right if we do it right now. And if not right now, uhm, let's figure out a time when it's good for both of us. 

00:12:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, you know, I'm sort of busy now. And, ah, you know, is it that important, that you need to talk to? What is this about? I mean, I, we had no work to do right now. 

00:12:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, it is important. Uhm, it's important to me. Uhm, and I think it should be important to you. 

00:12:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What do you mean important to me? 

00:12:25
Practicing the new story 

00:12:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uhm, I wanna talk and well, I wanna talk about an incident that happened a couple, couple of days ago. And I was, we were, we were, we were talking, uhm, I was going to be taking a run. And, ah, we're waiting for the elevators and you, you know, you made a comment about how I looked. And he's like, "Yeah. Well, you looked great! So what? What's the big deal?" And maybe that's what you should've said but you didn't. You, you got into detail about my legs and, and I just don't think that's, that's appropriate. Uhm, in or out of the office. Ever. I, I don't know. I don't think it's appropriate. Is that something you feel the same about? 

00:13:05
Positive feedback 

00:13:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, I certainly think that you're doing a good job of your verbalizing 'coz that is certainly much ah, to the point. I, I really felt that you did a good job. Now, what you're gonna have to contend with, and maybe we can't really go into, if I reject this or I become- 

00:13:25
Confrontive open question 

00:13:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - what happens if I become defensive when you talk to me? 

00:13:25
KATHRYN BOHN  I think, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN How are you gonna handle that? Well, I don't understand why you're so upset about that, Kathryn. I mean, I just, ah, hey, you've got, you've got good legs. What am I gonna do? Great legs. Still I think you have good legs. You're just too sensitive, you know, it's very typical of women being, sensitive you know, with all this, that sexual harassment stuff going on. 

00:13:50
KATHRYN BOHN Well, it is sexual harassment, John. 

00:13:55
Story becomes action 

00:13:55
KATHRYN BOHN I mean, how can you make a comment about my legs, my good looks if, if it's not that? I mean, what other definition would you put on it? If it's not. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, most women like that! I mean, I thought you kinda liked that. 

00:14:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Look, I know how I feel. I know how I look. Uhm, there's enough of societal things out there that are telling me how I should look. Why do I need someone with whom I work, ah, with whom I, you know, interact with, whom I have to interact with in a very professional setting, making me feel conscious or being conscious about my legs? Why is that important to you? Why is it important to enter that conversation, into the workplace? 

00:14:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I would say, Kathryn, I'm, I'm out of, I'm not John. I'm Norma now. But it helps. 

00:14:40
KATHRYN BOHN I know. 

00:14:40
It does not always happen this easily, but the structure and method remain the same. Stage 5: Generalization and transfer of learning "Can you take the new story home?" 

00:14:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You could, if you can sustain with the way you reacted both verbally, non-verbally, and, ah, then I think that you can deal with John. Ah, what we need to be prepared for is, is, is whether you're gonna be able to sustain this kind of, ah, reaction if, in the real world. And before we go out and, I think one of the things that we might want to do is have another session. 

00:15:20
KATHRYN BOHN Uh-huh. 

00:15:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And sort of reflect on how you came across, which is very good, I mean you really did a superb job. 

00:15:25
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. 

00:15:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, and it, it does reflect, I think one of the things that Al told me is that you had a mother that was a very good role model and was able to take care of herself... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and stand up for herself... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and still give, and still be warm and giving... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...but on the same hand, being in control. 

00:15:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I liked what I saw, and I'd like to have one more session with you before we launch you. 

00:15:45
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. I... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It worked. 

00:15:45
KATHRYN BOHN  I think that's good though. I, I think that would be good but I. (crosstalk) 

00:15:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN How do you feel right now? 

00:15:50
KATHRYN BOHN I feel good. 

00:15:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, you feel good. Great! 

00:15:55
KATHRYN BOHN I feel there's like a, like a, like my back is straight and my, I'm, my, my chest is high and I feel really good that, that, that I can do this. But I also realize that, yeah, it is a very non-confrontational session, uhm, that you are sitting here with me and, and you're, and, and you are not John. And I, and I, I do need that practice. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN But I think you needed a practice... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and I do think that one of the things that you didn't come across is being aggressive. And I think it's one of the things that most businesswomen were able to come up aggressive, but you came, uhm, assertive, sure of yourself and in control. 

00:16:25
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And I liked what I saw. 

00:16:25
KATHRYN BOHN Okay. Well, it's good. Thanks. I hope it works again. 

00:16:25
End Assertive Training Teaching Microskills to Clients: Training as Treatment Norma Gluckstern with Allen Ivey 

00:16:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Al, we've been doing these tapes, it's hard to believe, since 1974. And since this is maybe our last tape, what do you think we've got to do with our finale? 

00:16:45
ALLEN IVEY  First of all, I thank those people out there for listening to us. Ah, what we're going to do in this one is focus on teaching other people the skills of interviewing. Now, we're not making them interviewers but what we're really looking at how you can, shhhh, just a quick, short interviewing strategy, teach somebody else attending behavior. I think it's a very, I find, I use it again and again and again as a therapeutic adjunct. Ah, if you (inaudible ) can panel(ph) over to me here for a moment, ah, I'd just start to tell you a brief story. Ah, back in, literally, ah, 1968, I was working with this college student that was depressed. And ah, he couldn't find any, he said, "I don't have any friends." And so, kind of on the spot, I did an informal training in attending behavior, eyes, eye contact, forward lean and so forth. And lo and behold, as he went back and, ah, he came back and said he'd found some friends. So, many of these skills were working on in here can be very useful as quick, short strategies to teach people some useful skills. So I'd like to think about the whole idea of teaching skills in counseling and therapy. 

00:17:55
Training as treatment Please note that skill teaching does move as fast as this demonstration. 

00:17:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You're pretty down. Could you, ah, talk a little bit about what's happening? 

00:18:05
Depressed clients focus internally on themselves 

00:18:05
ALLEN IVEY Well, yeah, I just feel kinda like there's, hmm, kinda hammers inside and I just feel really crummy. And the things are so bad and, ah, I, can't, my family doesn't, you know, doesn't listen to me and I've got so many problems and, I just don't feel like, like I can do much. 

00:18:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Al, I wonder if you like, kind of look at me, and that might help you. One of the things... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:18:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...is that, it might bring you a little bit is, is paying attention to, just look at someone else. 

00:18:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  How do you feel when you look at me? 

00:18:50
Focus moves slightly external 

00:18:50
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, well, I still feel down but, ah, you know, I do notice that, ah, you got a, a bright, ah, ah, ah, shirt on... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:19:05
ALLEN IVEY ...and, ah, and I, you know. 

00:19:05
Directive 

00:19:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN One of the things that it did is that it helped you think about something else besides yourself, and that's one of the things that we're going to try to do this afternoon, is help you maybe get out of yourself. 

00:19:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And one way we'll get out of ourselves is maybe to look at another person. 

00:19:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So, one of the first things, this is for you to do, is look at me. 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And you did, you observe. 

00:19:25
Reinforce even small positives 

00:19:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Now, one of the things that I want, is maybe you can come on back- 

00:19:30
Holding client focus externally can be difficult 

00:19:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - I'm losing you. 

00:19:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  'Coz you're, when you do that, it means you're getting back into yourself, now. 

00:19:35
ALLEN IVEY  Yeah, and I noticed that, I breathe a little freer when I'm up like this. 

00:19:40
Look for body changes 

00:19:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Okay. 

00:19:45
Directive 

00:19:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And now, what I'd like you to do... (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:19:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...is sort of look at me and think about something you might like to ask me, something you might like to know about me. 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY  Uhm, How old are you? 

00:20:00
Expect slow starts! 

00:20:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Oh, no, that's a good question. You know that I've been 50 holy for the last 20 years. 

00:20:05
ALLEN IVEY Uhm. 

00:20:05
Reinforce positives 

00:20:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I used, what made you smile when I said that? 

00:20:10
ALLEN IVEY Oh, dear. You're kinda funny person at times even though I do feel pretty sad, ah. 

00:20:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right. 

00:20:15
Allen gets the point 

00:20:15
ALLEN IVEY So, you see, the basic point is that ah, (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  The thing... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
ALLEN IVEY I'm thinking about my self too much. 

00:20:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. And what I think, I wanna try to do is sort of teach you some of what we call attending skills... (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...or active listening skills. 

00:20:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
Emphasize generalization to real life 

00:20:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And one of the reasons we do that is to help you get out of yourself. If you're concentrating how I feel, then how are you going to think about how you feel. 

00:20:40
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:20:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so, over the next few weeks, we're... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...gonna work on that, concentrating how somebody else... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:20:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...feels. And you do that by eye contact, by listening to their voice and vibe what they say. 

00:20:50
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:20:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so I think that's what we're gonna do. Well try it. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
ALLEN IVEY That won't hurt. 

00:20:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's not going to be easy. 

00:20:55
ALLEN IVEY It won't hurt. 

00:20:55
Debriefing the demonstration 

00:20:55
ALLEN IVEY  Basically, this is what I did in the, in the hospital, and done for years and, believe it or not, and it would take longer time, I'd often get video tapes and patients would see themselves... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
ALLEN IVEY ...moving back and forth. 

00:21:10
Training as treatment 

00:21:10
ALLEN IVEY  And just treatment in attending behavior and open questions were enough to get patients who'd been in the hospital, literally for 20 years, out. And, ah, it's quite amazing, ah, that this particular simple social skill isn't used more with depression. I don't claim it's a cure-all but I do say, it's one of those important pieces of counseling and therapy, ah, teaching people skills. 

00:21:40
Teach skill to peers and volunteers 

00:21:40
ALLEN IVEY The other piece, and you certainly done a lot with that, would like these people to talk about is that, you did some wonderful work and training, ah, community volunteers in these skills. And we hope, you know, a lot of people out there are going to be doing people, doing training of peer counselors, peer volunteers and so forth. And as sort as we wind up, Norma, if you could sort of tell them about some of your own experience in training groups using these skills. 

00:22:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Well, I think, my interest in communication came really because of Al. Ah, I had been inundated with theoretical aspects of, of counseling, ah, and, then I read ah, article which said, it really didn't matter what theory it was, what really mattered was the relationship that you as a counselor could establish with your client. And that's why I met Al. And what I found, is that he taught me how to communicate and that, and he taught me how to communicate as a counselor, and later, I communicate as just a person. I, I found that I know skills that I use as a counselor. I use more of the listening skills and I do the influencing skills. But that has, in fact, created for me ah, ah, a good feeling, pe, about people feel about me and so, ah, I as a therapist, don't really worry to which what my theory, what I really worry about is how can I con, how do I listen, how do I attend, how do I ask the right kind of questions and paraphrase. And sometimes that's all I need. Sometimes, I don't have to go on to the influencing skills, because you really do then, need to help your, ah, clients sort out, and get them moving. But its, but it's, what is most important, from my perspective, is how we communicate, because that's what I call the three V's. 

00:23:20
Three V's of attending 

00:23:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  How we visually look at somebody, how we vocally sound, and how verbally we sound. 

00:23:25
ALLEN IVEY  Hmm. And one of the things I really liked in your work is when you go out and train peer volunteers, basically, the same way people who are going in this class. 

00:23:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
ALLEN IVEY And you were the first person, I think you are the first person. You're the first person certainly to demonstrate that peer counselors could change what happens in the lives of their clients. 

00:23:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY And research is the first that anybody had done. And you basically took people through the same type of training that people in the class are, are, are getting. (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Absolutely. And, ah, it was, it was very rewarding for them as well for us... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and the fact that this was one of the first opportunities... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...to look at whether this was viable. 

00:24:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So one thing I- 

00:24:05
Training as treatment 

00:24:05
ALLEN IVEY - would like to say as we close, is think about yourself as a teacher of skills. One in the interview with, ah, normal clients, kinda watch what's going on, more severely distressed also can benefit this. And finally, think about the idea of going out and training peer volunteers, community volunteers and listening skills themselves, the counselor as a teacher of skills. I'll give you the final word Norma. 

00:24:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN No, I think you do it well. And thank you for listening to our tapes. 

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY Thanks Norma.

00:24:30
ALLEN IVEY  The core or the basic listening sequence, the influencing skills and the microskills theoretically is story, strength, re-story, action. And in this next tape, we're going to demonstrate some of these ideas, not the action ideas, via the skill of interpretation. Norma Gluckstern will work with Kathryn Bohn on listening to her story, finding some strengths and then moving to the issue of re-storying. We're not gonna worry about action at this point, the idea that is to find new ways to look at the story. And the skill of interpretation is perhaps the most important of all in re-storying. 

00:25:50
"Coming Home" 

00:25:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Kathryn, the last time we were here, you mentioned some of the problems you've had since you moved back home and(ph), ah, what I wonder is if you wanted to continue that conversation or if there was some other issue you'd like to talk about. 

00:26:05
KATHRYN BOHN I, I think I do, uhm, I've been away at school and, and then working, uhm, in another part of the country for a while and I'd move back closer to my folks, uhm, you know, couple, within a couple of hours and, ah, I was, uhm, anticipating kind of, you know, interacting with them as, and as, as an adult. I mean, I was an adult. I was in my, you know, my late 20s and I was looking forward to, you know, going to dinner with them or, you know, just kind of hanging out with them and interacting with them and, uhm, I just, I have to say I was sort of, uhm, shocked, uhm, by, ah, sort of the reaction or the welcome, uhm, that I received. 

00:26:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What do you mean by that you were- 

00:26:40
Open question, encourage 

00:26:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - shocked by the welcome you received? 

00:26:40
KATHRYN BOHN  Well, uhm, my dad and I used to work in the garden a lot and just, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:26:45
KATHRYN BOHN in the yard, and do different things and, uhm, I wanted to, I said, "Yeah, let's go work in the yard." It was so fun. I mean I used to admire him and his knowledge of, you know, the yard and the grass and the trees and ask him a lot of questions. And so I said, "You know, let's, let's do that." And we did one day and I, uhm, and it, it, uhm, I just wanted to, to sort of not be like old times, but just sort of work with him and, and maybe showing him my knowledge and what I had learned and, and instead it became a lesson, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hmm. 

00:27:15
KATHRYN BOHN he, he just said, "No, you're not doing it right." And, and maybe before when I was, you know, 16 or 15, I'd be like "Oh, okay, how do I do it?" But now I'm like, "Wait, wait a minute," ah, this was not a lesson. This is just us getting together, hanging out and it just took it, I mean I, I just didn't know how to react to that. 

00:27:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, what I hear you- 

00:27:35
Reflection of feeling 

00:27:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - say is that you're a little frustrated and, and angry about what's going on with you and your father right now and the way he's treating you. 

00:27:40
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, I, I just, uhm, I feel that, I mean in, instead of just hanging out and getting together, he treats everything as if we, ah, as if I was 16 or, or 15 and I'm, he almost like gets out this inner child in me and... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:27:55
KATHRYN BOHN ...you know, and when he, when he, when he, when he says, snaps and says, "I'm the teacher, it's a lesson now, let's learn." I'm like, "Hello, I, I've been, I'm not, I'm not gonna just become your pupil a, again or not gonna speak comments to people and come to your attention, I, you need to interact with me." 

00:28:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What I hear you- 

00:28:15
Summary of Story 

00:28:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - saying a little bit I think is that he's treating you in a, in a different timeframe that you're at, and that that's not where you are, you're an adult. 

00:28:20
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. 

00:28:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN You're not a little girl anymore. And the other thing I hear is you're saying that, ah, that you're acting sometimes like a little girl and that that's frustrating you too. So that you're, it's a, it's a, a double badger. And he's acting, he's treating you like a child and you're responding like a child. 

00:28:35
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. That, that's, that's right on the mark. I am responding like a child and I don't want to respond like a child. 

00:28:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Ah, I'm gonna ask you to do something- 

00:28:45
Positive asset search 

00:28:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - that may seem very difficult for you. And, and but could you reinterpret or reframe that story or rewrite the story in a more positive way? Can you find anything positive that's going on between you and your father? 

00:29:00
KATHRYN BOHN Well I think, uhm, I think what's positive about it is that I'm, I've, I have moved back home. I've decided to, that I wanted, I wanna get to know my, my parents again as, as an adult that, that he is taking the time to sort of interact with me and, uhm, you know, and then just be an adult, ah, with me. I... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You seemed kinda hesitant- 

00:29:25
Feedback 

00:29:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - that you're not totally convinced of what you're saying. 

00:29:30
KATHRYN BOHN ...well I, I, I wanna, I wanna, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Think a little 'coz this is really a hard task. I mean, you have a lot of, sort of negative feelings about this. And for me to ask you to give it a, as they say, (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
KATHRYN BOHN Positive spin. 

00:29:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN as they say a positive, positive spin. But, but think about it and maybe think in terms of how he might be thinking about you and, and what's going on in his mind that's he's treating you in this way. 

00:29:50
KATHRYN BOHN I don't think he knows. Ah, I, I think he's, I think it's been a long time for him. You know... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:29:55
KATHRYN BOHN ...it's been 10 years and I think while adults don't change that much, I mean, once you sort of go through puberty and become an adult and you're married, you're sort of settled in your ways and I think for me there's been a lot of change since... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:30:10
KATHRYN BOHN ...I was 16 and I, I don't think, and since he really wasn't a part of that, not because he wasn't involved but, you know, you're, you're away at school or you're working and you, you call your parents. You see them maybe once or twice a year but you don't, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
KATHRYN BOHN ...hang out with them. You're not there every day and you're not doing homework every night with them in the house and it's, I think that, I, I think he wasn't, he didn't know what to expect maybe. 

00:30:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so it sounds like he's falling back to his past behavior. 

00:30:30
KATHRYN BOHN To maybe to what he knows and he, he, (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:30:35
KATHRYN BOHN he's not sure how, "What do I say this, this woman?" you know, "She's a woman. She's not a little girl anymore. What, you know, what, do I ask her about her boyfriends?" I mean that just seems weird. Maybe, you know, he's not sure and so he... (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN (inaudible ). 

00:30:46
KATHRYN BOHN ...you know, we, we, we talked about, ah, we talked about stuff that, that he's used to talking about. But, but in a way, that doesn't make me feel very adult, doesn't make me feel like I've grown up. 

00:30:55
One route toward reframing is listing to the story and asking the client to describe or restory the situation in new ways. Reframe by questioning 

00:30:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  As you talk about him where he's coming from, how does that make you feel? I mean, how might you reframe or rename the story and what's going on? Is it any different than when you first started to talk? 

00:31:15
KATHRYN BOHN Ah, yeah, I mean, I think I- 

00:31:15
Kathryn takes a new perspective on the story 

00:31:15
KATHRYN BOHN - I've, I've sort of stepped back a little bit and said, "Well you know, there's a lot to digest for him." Uhm, I think that, that maybe he, maybe just, maybe he just needs to, you know, we need to both try a little bit. Uhm, and he needs to see where I'm coming from and I need to see where he's coming from and, and maybe I just need to take a step back and say, "Okay," and gradually work up to and in an, in an, an adult conversation and... 

00:31:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN It's such a, what I hear- 

00:31:45
Paraphrase of Kathryn's strength 

00:31:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - if, if I, if, if I can label this for you is that you've grown, and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. 

00:31:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...maybe he hasn't. 

00:31:50
KATHRYN BOHN Well, yeah, I think that is it maybe. I mean that he, he hasn't grown in, in, in a way. I mean that's not, I mean, that's not really positive but, uhm, I mean he stayed the same, I, I, I'm sure. And yet I've grown and I think he's, had sort of grabbing, trying to catch up with my growth. (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. Ok. 

00:32:10
Gathering more data: How does father tell the story? 

00:32:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Kathryn, if it's all right with you, I'd like you to sort of focus a little bit differently. I'd like to hear your, about your father. Tell me a little bit about him, what he's like, where he works, whatever. 

00:32:20
KATHRYN BOHN  He's, uhm, he's, I think in a pretty powerful position. Uhm, he's head of a organization, uhm, a company, uhm, small company but, you know, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
KATHRYN BOHN big company and, and a, he's in his, you know, late 50s, probably pretty settled in his ways, uh hmm, certainly. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  You're laughing. 

00:32:45
KATHRYN BOHN Well I hope he's not settled in his ways. Uhm, but I mean, I, that's, I mean, he's, you know, he's, he's been in the community for a while, has lived here for a while and people know him. He's, you know, well established, ah, both in his profession and, and I think in the community. 

00:33:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. Uhm, how do you think he might tell the story of your moving close to home again? 

00:33:05
KATHRYN BOHN Wow. Uhm, I would, I would think that he would, ah, be a little nervous at first, uhm, you know, "What's going on?" Maybe, "What's wrong? Why is she moving back home?" Maybe, ah, get excited but yet hang on out. "Does this mean you're moving in with us again?" And then, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
KATHRYN BOHN Not wanting that to happen. I mean and, and maybe, uhm, I'm not, you know, I, I would hope not too negative but I think a little hesitant, I think not sure, uhm, maybe unsure how to, how to interact with me. 

00:33:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Ah, so, so do you think his response to you of, of, if I were to ask you, after having told me this, is there something that's causing him to respond to you in this way, do you think? 

00:33:55
KATHRYN BOHN You mean like the way he did in the garden... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:33:55
KATHRYN BOHN ...that day? 

00:33:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  If he has those kind of feelings? 

00:34:00
KATHRYN BOHN Ah, I guess then it's a pretty natural reaction like... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Oh, yeah. 

00:34:05
KATHRYN BOHN ...that, that maybe, uhm, maybe I see it, maybe it is natural and he is, I have to, maybe I should ask him questions, "Well, how do you feel about this?" Or maybe, maybe start asking him not just to be involved in my life but maybe some way for me to be involved in his life that if I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN A more sharing relationship. 

00:34:20
New words frame the situation and goals differently 

00:34:20
KATHRYN BOHN ...a more sharing relationship maybe, and not so much me, me, me 'cause it, 'cause I guess that's how it was when I was younger. I mean, parents are your parents and they, they, they do everything for you, you know? They feed you, they clothe you, they pay for everything and I think he's... 

00:34:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Little child. 

00:34:40
KATHRYN BOHN Maybe a little afraid, a little afraid maybe that I'm gonna, that's gonna all come back and I want him to see that no, I mean I, I, I make my own living, I'm... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Right. 

00:34:45
KATHRYN BOHN ...I'm on my own and but, but maybe I need to see him in a different light. Maybe I need... (crosstalk) 

00:34:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yes. 

00:34:50
KATHRYN BOHN ...to see that. 

00:34:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Maybe you have to help him look at it from another perspective. 

00:34:50
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. Maybe that, that's what I need to do, yeah. 

00:34:55
Reframing from Intergenerational Family and Cultural Perspectives 

00:34:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Ah, another way of looking at this is is this really from a cultural point of view or an ethnic point of view? I wonder what your background is in terms of your own, ah, families or family origin? 

00:35:10
KATHRYN BOHN My, I was uhm 80 percent Swedish, a little bit of English and a little bit of German. Uhm. 

00:35:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Well, since I'm neither of those, maybe you could help me in, in, in how would a, a Swedish family react, ah, since that seems to be the strongest part of your background, to having someone come back who had been gone away for years, number of years, you've broken away, you know, cut the bound, bond... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...has separated the boundaries, how would they react, do you think, coming back of one of the, of one, back into the fold? 

00:35:40
KATHRYN BOHN I think there's one thing about Swedes and that is they're very polite and very gracious, uhm, people. Uhm, I mean, as my family is they're, they would welcome anybody into their home but like that I think though that like, like fish and guests(ph) stink after three days. I mean, you just, you, I mean, that, that they had done all the nurturing they could. I mean, they've, they've raised me, they've, you know, I've, I've become an adult. They've done the best they can and I think that, that their, they, they wanna see that continue. Uhm, I think that while they're happy to see me and they wanna interact with me that, that they wanna make sure that I'm still on my own, that I, I'm, I'm still growing and, and on my own living. And I, I think that's. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Does this give you an insight into what maybe going on with your returning home? 

00:36:25
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, it does. (laughing) 

00:36:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN What did you think of them? 

00:36:30
KATHRYN BOHN I think about it with, I mean with, with, you know, I mean, that they're, they're extremely gracious and they have been, uhm, they're, I mean, they've helped me, you know, move in but that they really wanna make sure that, that the growing process of becoming adult and be living, coming, you know, moving on your own is the process that continues, not that you revert back to eating every meal with them. And, ah, you know, I think it, I mean that's interesting, I, now that I think about it, they have sort of gone through the separation process of me leaving. I have, ah, and I think that, that needs to continue. 

00:37:00
"Coming Home" in many Northern European families can be a violation of cultural expectations for separation How might families from different cultures experience the same situation? 

00:37:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  It's interesting what you said about the fish and guest after three days stink or smell. Because it, my experience has been that that is a somewhat typical of maybe of, of the, of, more on Northern Europeans, and that their expectations is that you cut the boundaries. There's a certain point when you leave home and you mature and that's it. And you come back to visit but you don't come back to settle in, which in some ways- 

00:37:40
Reframe from cultural perspective 

00:37:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - is very different from my background, which is more Mediterranean. 

00:37:40
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Where if you leave home, people are very upset. And then when you come home, they are gracious and they open their arms and almost wanna to make you a child again so it's sort of interesting that they're, they also are making you a child but it's a different kind of way and that the same kind of resentment of, "Hey, I'm an adult but I'm coming home to live" is not dissimilar to the one that you're having. But the reaction or the reason for it is somewhat different from, ah, Northern Europeans and Southern or Mediterranean Europeans. 

00:38:10
KATHRYN BOHN That's interesting. That's really, yeah, I never thought about that way, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:38:15
KATHRYN BOHN But I think that's right. 

00:38:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And so, some of what you've experienced- 

00:38:15
Self-disclosure 

00:38:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - I think I have experienced also and... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN When I found myself having to come closer to home... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...and then fighting off my tradition, and you're trying to push- 

00:38:25
Interpretation 

00:38:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - your tradition the other way. 

00:38:25
KATHRYN BOHN Right. I want a little bit of your tradition and not... (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Correct. 

00:38:25
KATHRYN BOHN ...so much of mine and, yeah, that's, that's, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Yeah. 

00:38:30
KATHRYN BOHN That is interesting, I, I, yeah. 

00:38:30
Obtaining behavior specifics helps us understand and may lead to move effective reframing of client stories Concreteness and behavioral specifics 

00:38:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Ah, another way of looking at this that we'd like, I'd like to try it with you is perhaps you could describe to me what was happening when you went out in the garden with your father at first? 

00:38:50
KATHRYN BOHN  I- 

00:38:55
Formal operational, abstract response 

00:38:55
KATHRYN BOHN - think that we were, I thought we were just having a, kind of a good time, ah, sharing something we'd liked to do together. And I think for him it was kind of a reverting back to when we were 16. I think for him where he thought that he was gonna be teaching me something. 

00:39:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So he, what was his behavior then? 

00:39:10
KATHRYN BOHN He was- 

00:39:10
Behavioral specifics of relationship 

00:39:10
KATHRYN BOHN - I mean, I think, I don't know, I was planting something I remember and, and, and he was like, "No, no, no, not like this. Now let me teach you this." And I was like, lessons are over. Hah. I don't wanna be taught today or whatever and I, I mean, but I, I didn't say that. I, I, I, and I kick myself for not saying that I, I, I got really upset. I was like, "Well, what do you mean I'm doing it wrong? Why are you criticizing me? Why are you, why are you jumping all over my case?" And I mean, I just, I got really angry that he just blew up I mean 'cause I felt like he's blowing up at me for something so petty. 

00:39:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So his- 

00:39:45
Summary and reflection of feelings 

00:39:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - behavior was to treat you like teaching and the, well, and the consequences of that, it seems to me what you're saying is that you got angry, irritated, you were disappointed, and you just had a lot of re, you reacted immaturely. 

00:40:00
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah. 

00:40:00
Search for more specifics 

00:40:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN In fact, what did you say to him? 

00:40:05
KATHRYN BOHN Oh I just, I don't know, I went off and I said, you know, you have no right to do this. I am, this is not a lesson, you can't just expect me to be a teacher and that you'd be a teacher and I'd be a pupil. You know, I'm an adult, treat me like one. And I'm, and I was, you know, it's funny 'cause I was like screaming at him and like, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
KATHRYN BOHN getting all upset and angry and frustrated and I don't know if I started to cry then or what, but I was like, Oh, God, why am I... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  So. 

00:40:30
KATHRYN BOHN ...why am I reacting here? 

00:40:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN So if I ask you was it rational behavior? 

00:40:30
KATHRYN BOHN No, I think not when I think about it. No. I, I mean it probably wasn't. 

00:40:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And as you think about it (inaudible ) what was your feelings about it? 

00:40:40
KATHRYN BOHN Well, my feelings are that, I wanted him to treat me a certain way but he wasn't used to treating me that way. I mean, I wanted him to treat me like an adult like he would've if it was just, you know, doing it with a friend of his, a buddy or, you know, someone else, my mother. And he, uhm, instead he, you know, it was like I was a child again and... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN I asked you a question about your- 

00:41:00
Confrontation 

00:41:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - feelings but you're telling me about your behavior. So what were you feeling? 

00:41:05
KATHRYN BOHN I was upset. 

00:41:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Okay. 

00:41:05
KATHRYN BOHN  I was, uhm, I was frustrated. I, I would, I would put anger on it. 

00:41:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Hmm. So how would you change that scenario if I went back and said you're out there gardening with your father and he began to tell you what to do? How would you change the scenario? 

00:41:25
KATHRYN BOHN I think I would sort of maybe take a deep breath like I am now... (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:41:30
KATHRYN BOHN ...uhm, and ask him and say, 'You know this is not a lesson to me right now. I, I just wanna kind of work with you in the garden and," uhm, and, and just in a very calm voice, and not a very elevated, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Uh hmm. 

00:41:45
KATHRYN BOHN volume. Just say, "You know, if we can just work together that would be great. Uhm, just, you know, and not, not, don't look at it as a lesson and, and me doing it right or wrong but just, let's look at it as just two people planting flowers." 

00:41:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN  Now you think you could do it? 

00:42:00
KATHRYN BOHN Oh, gosh. 

00:42:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN Maybe what we need to do is, is the next session, talk about when this happens, how you've been doing it(ph) and it's a thing called assertive training. I think you did some of that work in the past... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN And what it would be like to- 

00:42:15
Moving to behavioral action via the new story or reframe 

00:42:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN - really assert yourself in, in bring the relationship between your father and yourself, which I think you want to be a good relationship... (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
KATHRYN BOHN Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN ...into a mature relationship of two adults. You've always be his daughter but I think that you can bring it to another level. 

00:42:25
KATHRYN BOHN Yeah, I, I think it's where it need to be. 

00:42:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN All right, so we'll do that next time you come. 

00:42:30
End Interpretation/Reframe Five-Stage Interview: Developing a New Vocational Story Allen E. Ivey with Mary Bradford Ivey 

00:42:30
ALLEN IVEY  Vital to the microskills framework is the five-stage structure of the interview. William Matthews of the University of Massachusetts and I engaged in a conversation some years ago and tried to figure out how could we, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions of an interview that works. And we came up with these five stages, which are now really foundational to basic influencing skills, ah, the book that we're working on here, certainly essential in basic attending skills. We can do, do a whole interview well structured just working on this. In this particular tape, we're going to do a kind of a remake of, ah, an interview that I did with Mary a few years ago for intentional interviewing and counseling. And one of the things all of us need to be able to do is work on issues of vocation, vocational choice. And the five-stage structure really basically is I first need to establish a reasonable relationship with Mary. 

00:43:35
Rapport and structure 

00:43:35
ALLEN IVEY The second stage is I need to draw their concern. Of course as part of that we need to look for the positive- 

00:43:45
Define issue and positive assets 

00:43:45
ALLEN IVEY - asset search, positive asset search, find strengths, strengths in their story. And then we move to what would Mary like to happen, have happened. Stage three ah give some specifics and goals because if you don't know where you're going, you may (inaudible ). You may end up somewhere else. If you don't know where you're going, you may end up somewhere else. The fourth stage of course is brainstorming- 

00:44:05
Generate alternatives 

00:44:05
ALLEN IVEY - and come up with ideas, new ways of looking at things. And it's this fourth stage that influencing skills are the most important. In this demonstration of vocational counseling interview, we'll have a few influencing skills as well. Stage five is generalization. If you don't take home what's happened in the interview, it's all a waste of time. So, vocational counseling is really structured like a problem-solving interview and you'll see a lot of define the problem, generate alternatives and can we act on the alternatives. Or hear the client's story, find the strength, develop a new story and then act on the new story. So, on to the five-stage structure of the interview. 

00:44:45
Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring "Hello" 

00:44:45
ALLEN IVEY  Hi, Mary. Nice to see you. How are you today? 

00:44:50
MARY IVEY  Well, fine. Hi, Allen. Nice to see you. 

00:44:55
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. I, I,- 

00:44:55
Relationship building Positive Assets 

00:44:55
ALLEN IVEY - I was looking at your file... (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
ALLEN IVEY ...and I said, "Gee, you've done a lot of interesting things ah, (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
MARY IVEY Hmm. 

00:45:00
ALLEN IVEY you've been a Phys Ed teacher and I said, hey, I noticed you put on honors and awards. You've done a lot of stuff as swimming. Can you tell me a little about that? 

00:45:10
MARY IVEY Oh, yeah. I, I've, uhm, and I just love swimming. It's one of my favorite things and, (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:15
MARY IVEY and uhm, I have done a lot of work with, actually, water ballet and, and synchronized swimming in college and... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:45:20
MARY IVEY ...have enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed, uhm, teaching girls this too. 

00:45:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, and apparently won some prizes I think? 

00:45:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. Yeah. It's so... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:45:25
MARY IVEY ...exciting. 

00:45:25
ALLEN IVEY  Could you tell me just a, a little bit about one? 

00:45:30
MARY IVEY Well, uhm, it was, it was for our whole... (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
MARY IVEY ...group in college, the group of women that worked together in entering a competition and it was quite exciting 'coz we all worked together very hard and, (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:45:40
MARY IVEY and put on a really nice, uhm,- 

00:45:40
Paraphrase with check-out focus on award and relationship 

00:45:40
MARY IVEY - show. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
ALLEN IVEY  Do I hear the compe. (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
MARY IVEY Ah, we've won an award. (crosstalk) 

00:45:45
ALLEN IVEY I see that the award was great but I also heard you really like working with your friends in... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
MARY IVEY Yeah, it was very fun. (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
ALLEN IVEY ...doing it. Is that right? 

00:45:50
Stage 2: Gathering information and identifying assets "What's you concern?" 

00:45:50
ALLEN IVEY  Well, I guess you're not here to talk about swimming, ah, what would you like to talk- 

00:46:00
Open question 

00:46:00
ALLEN IVEY - about today, Mary? 

00:46:00
MARY IVEY Well, Allen, uhm, you know I like swimming... (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
MARY IVEY ...and I,- 

00:46:05
Encourage 

00:46:05
MARY IVEY - you know, I've always liked modern dance but I'm a Phys Ed teacher and I really think that this is not- 

00:46:10
Mary's opening story 

00:46:10
MARY IVEY - the right place for me to be. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
MARY IVEY I don't like the soccer and the field hockey and the basketball particularly. I mean, I've always loved the swimming and the dance but that's not what I have to do all the time. I have to do these other things that I don't particularly enjoy. I've been... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:20
MARY IVEY ...doing it for three, four years now, well, four years now and I'm, I'm getting really kind of bored with it, frankly. 

00:46:25
ALLEN IVEY You're bored with it? 

00:46:25
MARY IVEY  Well, you know, with the same old thing over and over again and, and, you know if I'm not really enthusiastic about certain aspects of it, you know, then it's hard to make the girls enthusiastic, you know. I like parts of it but lots of the job... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
MARY IVEY ...I don't like. 

00:46:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. I sense that you feel- 

00:46:45
Reflection of Feeling 

00:46:45
ALLEN IVEY - a little bit frustrated in, in where you are right now. 

00:46:45
MARY IVEY Yeah, I am. 

00:46:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:46:45
MARY IVEY It's frustrating. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. What else is going on in your life, Mary? 

00:46:50
What else is going on in your life? We recommend the "what else" question to encourage disclosure of other possibly important information. 

00:46:50
MARY IVEY  Well, you know I have a relationship, ah, with a fellow and, uhm, and that's okay too. Uhm, but I'm mostly worried about what I wanna do. 

00:47:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
MARY IVEY You know, what, what I wanna do with my life and my career. 

00:47:10
Mary's second story 

00:47:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:10
MARY IVEY  Because it feels like I'm not really in the right field. 

00:47:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So you are- 

00:47:20
Paraphrase 

00:47:20
ALLEN IVEY - in a relationship but what's really serving you right for today really is what's going on in the job. 

00:47:25
MARY IVEY Yes. 

00:47:25
ALLEN IVEY Is that right? (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
MARY IVEY That's right. 

00:47:25
Check-out 

00:47:25
ALLEN IVEY And looking on to, to something else. 

00:47:30
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:47:30
Summary 

00:47:30
ALLEN IVEY Ah, so as we start this is I do hear that you're in Phys Ed. 

00:47:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
ALLEN IVEY And kinda like some other things... (crosstalk) 

00:47:40
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:47:40
ALLEN IVEY ...in it. I heard some of the activities you like. 

00:47:40
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:40
ALLEN IVEY But I also heard the sense of boredom and you sound like something that after four years, you'd like to find something else to do... (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
MARY IVEY Right. I don't wanna. (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, is that right? (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
MARY IVEY Yeah. I don't wanna be- 

00:47:50
Check-out 

00:47:50
MARY IVEY - doing this when I'm much older. I really don't. I, I wanna, (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
MARY IVEY this is, I just don't wanna be doing this for the rest of my life. 

00:47:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. What have been some of your fantasies- 

00:47:55
Open question 

00:47:55
ALLEN IVEY - for the, for the future? 

00:48:00
MARY IVEY Well, you know, uhm, the parts that I like about the job, I really like talking to the girls and they seem... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
MARY IVEY ...to come to me and, and share what they've done over the weekend or talking about... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
MARY IVEY ...their boyfriends and, and I like working with the colleagues. I like the women I work with, uhm, and the people. But that's a part that I like. I don't like teaching the skills... (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
MARY IVEY ...of basketball... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
MARY IVEY ...or the skills of field hockey or soccer. It's really not my thing... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
MARY IVEY ...and I guess it's the relationship that I really kinda like and I, you know, I like, you know, I think I can be pretty helpful to people. 

00:48:30
ALLEN IVEY So- 

00:48:30
Summary 

00:48:30
ALLEN IVEY - you keep talking about kids coming, talking to you with problems, (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:48:30
ALLEN IVEY you talk about relationships and I know this relationship was a word you used just when we first started talking about swimming. You like the swimming but your relationship seemed almost as important as the swimming. 

00:48:40
MARY IVEY Yes. 

00:48:40
ALLEN IVEY So that word "relationship" is a real key one for you. 

00:48:45
MARY IVEY Yeah. It really is. 

00:48:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. And what have you thought you might- 

00:48:45
Open question 

00:48:45
ALLEN IVEY - like to do with these relationships now? 

00:48:50
MARY IVEY Well, you know, I think, I, I would, I think I'd really like to go to school and, and train to be a counselor. 

00:48:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. You kind of like to be sitting in this chair,- 

00:48:55
Interpretation 

00:48:55
ALLEN IVEY - right? (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:48:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh.

00:49:00
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:49:00
Encourage 

00:49:00

00:49:05
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:49:05
ALLEN IVEY ...to look, look at something in the counseling- 

00:49:05
Reflection of feeling, paraphrase 

00:49:05
ALLEN IVEY - area. 

00:49:05
MARY IVEY Yeah. I'm thinking about that. (crosstalk) 

00:49:05
ALLEN IVEY Okay. I kinda got that general map- 

00:49:10
Structuring 

00:49:10
ALLEN IVEY - ah, I would like to get just a couple of more concretes about where you are right now... (crosstalk) 

00:49:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:15
ALLEN IVEY ...with all of this. I'd like to hear, could you give me a specific example- 

00:49:20
Open question further search for story strengths 

00:49:20
ALLEN IVEY - of a time when you really felt kinda high on the job. 

00:49:20
MARY IVEY  Well again it had to do with the one thing I like about the job, which is teaching swimming and putting together water ballet... (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
MARY IVEY ...uhm, and the kids are all working together and, and that's really about the only thing I really like about the actual work that I do. And that was fun as we, ah, developed ideas and, and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
MARY IVEY created, uhm, you know, the, (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ALLEN IVEY Well, now the, (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
MARY IVEY the music. 

00:49:45
ALLEN IVEY now, the word that kinda stands out for me- 

00:49:45
Confrontation 

00:49:45
ALLEN IVEY - Mary there is I get that enjoyment and excitement there, but you say it was the only thing that you've really enjoyed, is it? (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
MARY IVEY  Not really, you know, you know, like I said, there's a lot of it that's pretty boring. You teach exercise... (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:49:55
MARY IVEY ...class every day and soccer skills... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
MARY IVEY ...and basketball skills and you don't really like it then you wonder... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
MARY IVEY ...if this isn't, if this is the place that you should be. 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
MARY IVEY You know? So.(crosstalk) 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY So I hear the excitements- 

00:50:05
Summary of major discrepancy 

00:50:05
ALLEN IVEY - in relationship on one hand... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:50:10
ALLEN IVEY ...and I hear the boredom on the other hand... (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:50:10
ALLEN IVEY ...and this has kinda lead you to search for some new directions? 

00:50:15
MARY IVEY Right, right. 

00:50:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:50:18
MARY IVEY And there's a teacher, and there is a, another counselor in the school that I rather admired and, and it just seems so interesting the work that she does and, (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:25
MARY IVEY and, ah, she's kinda been an inspiration to me. (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:25
MARY IVEY I mean, I think that gee, I, I would like to do that kind of work. 

00:50:30
ALLEN IVEY So, she, you have a- 

00:50:30
Paraphrase 

00:50:30
ALLEN IVEY - teacher that's kind of an inspiration, huh? (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
MARY IVEY Yes. She actually, she became a counselor then and, and, uhm, she's been sort of my, a person that I look up to and admire and, and it just sounds like very interesting, the work she does every day. She will be working with people and... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:50:45
MARY IVEY ...helping them and I think that would be great. 

00:50:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay. Ah,- 

00:50:45
Focus on family story 

00:50:45
ALLEN IVEY - another thing that I think that you used to, used to look at, what is your family situation? Ah, you said you're in a relationship. Do you, ah, do you, and I also saw that you had a couple of children in the file. 

00:50:55
MARY IVEY Yup. 

00:50:55
ALLEN IVEY I'm not hearing anything about them or what's going on there? 

00:51:00
MARY IVEY Well, you know, they're in school and, and doing fine and, uhm, but the fellow I'm going with is not really excited about me going back to graduate school. 

00:51:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:51:05
MARY IVEY Not really at all, not particularly supportive, uhm, because it's, uhm, you know, we have a nice, I have a nice stable job and... 

00:51:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
MARY IVEY ...this will be sort of disruptive and, and, uhm, you know, and, and sort of a hassle. 

00:51:20
ALLEN IVEY So, it's a little bit of hassle... 

00:51:20
Reflection of feeling 

00:51:20
ALLEN IVEY If you're talking about moving on to something new. 

00:51:20
MARY IVEY Right. Yeah. 

00:51:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. And where are you... (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
MARY IVEY I mean really hard. 

00:51:20
ALLEN IVEY Where, were your kids on this? 

00:51:30
Open question 

00:51:30
MARY IVEY Oh, I think that they, whatever I wanna do, it's gonna be hard... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:51:30
MARY IVEY Though you've got kids and their activities going and it's gonna be hard to also... (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
MARY IVEY ...do graduate school. It's, it's gonna be a little bit challenging. 

00:51:35
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. So it sounds, I almost hear you- 

00:51:40
Interpretation leads to restorying 

00:51:40
ALLEN IVEY - like you kinda made sort of a tentative commitment to graduate school and counseling. Is that? 

00:51:45
MARY IVEY Well, I, I really feel like, you know, I just can't continue do, doing something... (crosstalk) 

00:51:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:45
MARY IVEY ...that doesn't feel right... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
MARY IVEY ...for me, that I wanna do something in where I feel like I can make a... (crosstalk) 

00:51:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:50
MARY IVEY ...contribution, and that would be more challenging and more exciting for me and... (crosstalk) 

00:51:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:51:55
MARY IVEY ...more fulfilling. 

00:51:55
ALLEN IVEY So the feedback- 

00:51:55
Summary with check - out 

00:51:55
ALLEN IVEY - I'd get, I'd give you at this point is that you really come across that very much that you'd liked to move on to something new.

MARY IVEY That would be great... (crosstalk) 

00:54:10

ALLEN IVEY ...as we go along. Another piece though is- 

00:54:25
Imagery directive "What is an ideal story?" 

00:54:25
ALLEN IVEY - I find it really helpful in, ah, vocational work is, could you close your eyes for a minute and just imagine yourself five years from now in a job that you might like and just say whatever comes across in your mind. 

00:54:40
MARY IVEY Well, the first thing that comes across my mind is I am sitting in my office, talking to people and I'm not outside on the field... (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:54:45
MARY IVEY ...uhm, dealing with 40 kids, 30 kids or whatever. I, I'm in an office, talking maybe to one student, or maybe a group of students, maybe even, uhm, a group of students, talking to them about college, just going to school or going to college or jobs... (crosstalk)

00:55:20
Confrontation 

00:55:20
ALLEN IVEY I kind of get a contrast 'coz I did feel a little bit of, uhm, I hear the boredom. I also sensed some kind of tension as you talk. 

00:55:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
ALLEN IVEY There's so, so, so basically in one hand where you are now gives you a little feeling of, but what would you say? But where would you (inaudible ) the feeling? In one hand, where you are now?

00:55:40
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:55:40
MARY IVEY  I'd feel like I'm doing something more challenging... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45

00:55:45
MARY IVEY ...and interesting. 

00:55:45

00:55:45
ALLEN IVEY  and the ideal here... (crosstalk) 

00:55:50

00:57:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
ALLEN IVEY ...and then I heard that you, there's a part of this is actually I heard you say you thought of going and visiting the State University, that the things that he said sort of kept you from going and I kinda wonder if you could... (crosstalk) 

00:57:55
MARY IVEY  He kinda discouraged me... (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
ALLEN IVEY ...share that a little bit more. (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
MARY IVEY ...because of this, the security of the job, I mean, and not to sort of ruin that... (crosstalk)

00:58:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:10

00:58:35
ALLEN IVEY ...to use, "scrambled?" 

00:58:35
MARY IVEY Yeah. I would say, uhm, you know, it's nice to have a supportive person but, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
Mary considers restorying 

00:58:40
MARY IVEY  In this area, it, you know, it's not there... (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:58:45
MARY IVEY And the... (crosstalk) 

00:58:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:58:45
MARY IVEY ...this feels like something I have to do on my own. 

00:58:45
ALLEN IVEY  I think what I might like to do- 

00:58:50
Gender focus, Directive for role play concretizing the story 

00:58:50
ALLEN IVEY - is, ah, something we sometimes call storytelling or, or, also particularly from a gender perspectives, I hear some male/female issues in here and could you sort of pretend for a minute that you're Bo... (crosstalk) 

00:59:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:05
ALLEN IVEY ...and sort of tell the story from his perspective what, with how he might be looking at you? Let's pretend you're Bo for a minute and tell me the story from his perspective. 

00:59:15
MARY IVEY Well, here's this very nice woman who's a, who's an excellent teacher, who gets great reviews, who the kids like and, and in a wonderful school system. Why, you know, why bother to change or do something different? 

00:59:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
MARY IVEY I mean why, uhm, upset the apple cart? Why make... (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
MARY IVEY More work for yourself. (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:59:30
MARY IVEY  To go to school? And, and you've got kids to raise and you know, if I could, you know, for me to be with, you know, I think he wants me to be with him. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
ALLEN IVEY And so you've, so Bo- 

00:59:45
Allen imagines Bo's story 

00:59:45
ALLEN IVEY - you really like to be with Mary more and not... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:59:45
ALLEN IVEY ...not have to lose her attention... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
MARY IVEY Right. 

00:59:45
ALLEN IVEY ...while she goes like that... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

00:59:45
ALLEN IVEY I'm pretending you're Bo... (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
MARY IVEY  Right. 

00:59:50
ALLEN IVEY I'm counseling Bo now. 

00:59:50
MARY IVEY Right. Yeah. It gets too much time, too much focus away from him. 

00:59:50
ALLEN IVEY  Okay, let's come back to you. How do you feel about the idea that Bo wants the- 

00:59:55
Open question 

00:59:55
ALLEN IVEY - focus on him? As we just do that, a little bit of, ah, sort of Gestalt type of exercise? (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
MARY IVEY It feels kinda selfish and it feels like, uhm, that's not, it's not really gonna work. 

01:00:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:05
MARY IVEY You know that relationship isn't gonna work... 

01:00:05
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
MARY IVEY ...and, uhm, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:00:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:10
MARY IVEY ...particularly if he can't be supportive in this area that I think is important. 

01:00:15
Confrontation 

01:00:15
ALLEN IVEY So I hear your saying that the two of you are seeing things differently, the relationship might not work and yet relationship, on the other hand, relationships are pretty important to you so. 

01:00:20
MARY IVEY Maybe that relationship- 

01:00:25
Mary is generating a new story line 

01:00:25
MARY IVEY - won't work or maybe other relationships will work. 

01:00:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
MARY IVEY Maybe there's somebody else. 

01:00:25
ALLEN IVEY So you're a little farther along that relationship- 

01:00:30
Confrontation 

01:00:30
ALLEN IVEY - uh, with Bo than I, that I kind of thought you were, ah, listening to you. Some points I heard you were saying that you really needed his support in relationship as you moved out into something new. And now, I hear you coming from a different space like you've, I get a little bit confused about where you are. 

01:00:45
MARY IVEY Well, ah, uhm, you know, you'll always feel a little bit, any change is always difficult... (crosstalk) 

01:00:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:50
MARY IVEY ...and, uhm, to leave something that's comfortable is gonna be- 

01:00:50
Mary changes on Confrontation Impact Scale as she explores a new story 

01:00:50
MARY IVEY  pretty hard but yet, uhm... (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
MARY IVEY ...if you feel like you wanna grow yourself and do something different... (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
MARY IVEY  you sometimes just have to take a risk... (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:00
MARY IVEY ...and taking a risk... (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:01:00
MARY IVEY ...is difficult. 

01:01:00
ALLEN IVEY I sense a- 

01:01:05
Reinforce strengths 

01:01:05
ALLEN IVEY - a lot of strength in yourself as you say that. I hear determination. If you're, you like, like Bo but you, it doesn't sound like, ah- 

01:01:10
Summary 

01:01:10
ALLEN IVEY - sound like you're gonna make your own decision... (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
MARY IVEY Well, I think so. I have... (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
ALLEN IVEY ...even though occasionally it appears now and then. 

01:01:15
MARY IVEY ...I, I've thought about it and I, I feel like it's time, you know, I can't do it later. It's gonna be time now and now is the time... (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:20
MARY IVEY ...not later. 

01:01:20
Stage 5: Generalization and transfer of learning "Can you take the new story home?" Open question 

01:01:20
ALLEN IVEY  Mary, ah, I kinda gone through some possibilities, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:30
ALLEN IVEY ...for going on in counseling. 

01:01:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:35
ALLEN IVEY Of all the things that I talked about, what kinda stood out for you from this sort of discussion about giving more information and follow-up in different places? 

01:01:40
MARY IVEY Well, I think it was helpful to get some specific information because you have to, you have to start some place and, and with good information, someone telling you... (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:50
MARY IVEY Giving you some direction, it really, ah, helps you to focus... (crosstalk) 

01:01:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:01:50
MARY IVEY ...on, on what needs to be done. 

01:01:55
ALLEN IVEY That's kinda general but what one thing- 

01:01:55
Open question 

01:01:55
ALLEN IVEY - stood out for you as I talked about, ah, the counseling and the things... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
MARY IVEY Well what you... (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
ALLEN IVEY ...you needed to do. 

01:02:00
MARY IVEY ...what you said, the one thing, you talked about, uhm, which gave me some encouragement, you said that, uhm, relationship, that I seemed to like relationships and that was one of the... (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:10
MARY IVEY ...critical things. So it gave me some confidence to think that I probably could really actually do this because... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
MARY IVEY ...I'm good, that relationships is important to me and... (crosstalk) 

01:02:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:15
MARY IVEY ...and, uhm, and that's one of the critical things in counseling. 

01:02:20
ALLEN IVEY So that theme is kinda- 

01:02:20
Summary 

01:02:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
ALLEN IVEY - shown right from, you talked about relationship being important in your, in your work or swimming. 

01:02:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:25
ALLEN IVEY This is, we started this session... (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
MARY IVEY Yeah. That's right. 

01:02:25
ALLEN IVEY And you talked about your relationships with the, with the teachers, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:02:30
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:30
ALLEN IVEY The colleagues, relationships with the kids... (crosstalk) 

01:02:35
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

01:02:35
ALLEN IVEY ...and the idea, using counseling as a way to use some of your relationship skills... (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
MARY IVEY Right. 

01:02:40
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, strikes you as really, really impressive. 

01:02:40
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

01:02:40
ALLEN IVEY Now the real crucial issue of course is action. 

01:02:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:02:45
ALLEN IVEY Now, I think we need to get a- 

01:02:45
Confrontation seeking action 

01:02:45
ALLEN IVEY  Specific commitment out of you to do something, and (inaudible ) we've done a lot of talking. 

01:02:53
MARY IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:02:55
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, a variety(ph) of things that could be done as you start thinking about this counseling field, they (inaudible ) for example, you really need to go on interview to these universities. 

01:03:01
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:03:05
Feedback, Advice 

01:03:05
ALLEN IVEY Ah, you really need to talk to counselors and learn a little bit more about what they do because you as I listened to you, you have kind of a... (crosstalk) 

01:03:10
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:10
ALLEN IVEY ...general idea. But I think you need to look for not everything in counseling is interesting. 

01:03:15
MARY IVEY So... (crosstalk) 

01:03:15
ALLEN IVEY There's, there's, there's a- 

01:03:15
Information/Advice 

01:03:15
ALLEN IVEY - can be a boredom factor there sometimes too, you know. 

01:03:15
MARY IVEY ...so you're not really... (crosstalk) 

01:03:15
ALLEN IVEY Watch out for a counseling job that just sets you down and, and never lets you see kids. Although sometimes though, they only let you do scheduling. 

01:03:25
MARY IVEY Right. So it'd be a good idea to interview counselors besides the one person I know. 

01:03:25
ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
MARY IVEY Yeah, I need to interview other counselors. 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:30
MARY IVEY And to see the difference. 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY So could we contract then- 

01:03:30
Aiming for concrete action and generalization 

01:03:30
ALLEN IVEY - for you to ah, before we follow up on this... (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:03:35
ALLEN IVEY ...is to go out and see somebody... (crosstalk) 

01:03:40
MARY IVEY Okay. 

01:03:40
ALLEN IVEY ...and also to visit, which university do you think you'd like to visit first? 

01:03:40
MARY IVEY Well, I think I'd like to go to the State University. I think that would be great. 

01:03:45
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:03:45
MARY IVEY I do think that would be closer and, you know, I think I'd like to do that... (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. And we found... (crosstalk) 

01:03:50
MARY IVEY ...is that a pretty good program? 

01:03:50
ALLEN IVEY It's a great program. 

01:03:50
Self-disclosure 

01:03:50
ALLEN IVEY I went there. 

01:03:50
MARY IVEY Oh. 

01:03:50
ALLEN IVEY  And I think that would really- 

01:03:55
Encourage 

01:03:55
ALLEN IVEY - go well. 

01:03:55
MARY IVEY Okay. 

01:03:55
ALLEN IVEY Ah, I'd like to, I think we've kind of got a good vocational plan. 

01:04:00
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay, well, are there any other issues that you wanna bring up today? 

01:04:05
MARY IVEY No, I think that's about it. 

01:04:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:05
MARY IVEY I'm ready to make some changes...(crosstalk) 

01:04:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
MARY IVEY ...in my career. 

01:04:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. Ah, so what I've heard in this interview- 

01:04:15
Summary, focus on key word 

01:04:15
ALLEN IVEY - so far, and, and I'd like to do one final thing as we... (crosstalk) 

01:04:15
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:15
ALLEN IVEY ...move toward the end is that I heard relationship, (crosstalk) 

01:04:20
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:20
ALLEN IVEY ...relationship, relationship. I heard that you hadn't been getting into looking in the counseling field. 

01:04:25
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah, partly because you've allowed yourself, ah, is that right, the right word? To let Bo make determinations to you and, ah, you haven't really said much about it, you're not, ah, you're, you're not really the person that comes across, ah, show as much (inaudible ) anger or frustration. You did use the word "frustration". 

01:04:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:04:45
ALLEN IVEY I got the feeling of frustration with you- 

01:04:45
Feedback 

01:04:45
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:45
ALLEN IVEY  ah, and ah, but- 

01:04:50
Summary of developing change in Mary's story 

01:04:50
ALLEN IVEY - I got the sense you moved along as you begin to say, "Oh, I'm gonna have to focus on me..." (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
ALLEN IVEY "And my needs..." 

01:04:55
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:04:55
ALLEN IVEY ..."And I really do wanna follow up and look at this counseling stuff more..." (crosstalk) 

01:05:00
MARY IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

01:05:00
ALLEN IVEY "And more." Is that kind of a... (crosstalk) 

01:05:00
MARY IVEY That's right, that's right. 

01:05:00
ALLEN IVEY ...okay. 

01:05:00

01:05:05
MARY IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
ALLEN IVEY ...ah, what stood out.- 

01:05:05
Open question 

01:05:05
ALLEN IVEY - for you of all the things that we've talked about, just any one thing? 

01:05:10
MARY IVEY Well- 

01:05:10
What one thing stands out for you from this session? Often a valuable way to end your conversation. 

01:05:10
MARY IVEY  -well, look, is it as I've said before, a relationship. And then I think the real commitment I have to do in something different and to move into counseling, (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
MARY IVEY ...and to move out of a field where I'm not as happy... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:05:25
MARY IVEY  and just do the right, I really expected to feel better about myself. 

01:05:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay we've got just about two or three minutes- 

01:05:35
Generalization 

01:05:35
ALLEN IVEY - left and, ah, look, we'll set another appointment... (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
MARY IVEY Yeah. 

01:05:40
ALLEN IVEY ...with the secretary on our way out but, ah, we talked, it's really important that some of the stuff that we do in here actually is followed through on. 

01:05:50
MARY IVEY Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:05:50
ALLEN IVEY And so, what do you plan to do next week?

01:05:55
ALLEN IVEY It's, I'll get you the literature, yeah. 

01:05:55
MARY IVEY ...all right. I'd like to explore the programs. Well, I think that I'd just soon go, you know, I'm probably pretty committed to that university and I'd like to get over there and maybe talk to some people there... (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:05
MARY IVEY ...about the program and I think I'd like to talk to some counselors in the field besides, well, this one friend of mine, you know, to get different perspectives... (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:10
MARY IVEY ...on what it's like and what aspect of counseling. Is it school counseling, is it a mental health counseling? What... (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
MARY IVEY ...kind of counseling do I wanna do and, and find out what's required and what, you know, and just even the details that... (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:20
MARY IVEY ...you know, do we have to send transcripts or what, what exactly do you have to do? Fill out applications? What are the steps that have to be followed to make all these... (crosstalk) 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:06:30
MARY IVEY ...happen? 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY And so rather- 

01:06:30
Paraphrase, self-disclosure 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY - you really sound like you're really ready to move on this. That makes me... (crosstalk) 

01:06:35

01:06:35
ALLEN IVEY ...pretty, feel really good to hear that... 

01:06:35
