UNKNOWN Okay, what I want to do in this session is to talk about the law and the way that the law impacts on counseling and psychotherapy. I think in the past, the law has been, ah, seen as something which is quite scary, it's almost as though it's something really outside the world of therapy. But what I would like to explore with you is the way is in which the law does impact on the work that we do as therapist. So, what I'm going to be talking about of the ways in which the law structured within UK as a whole and the different ways in which the law can have an impact, have an effect on the nature of therapeutic work that we do with our clients. So within this, I'm going to be talking about the, the structure of the law, the main divisions between the, the law and also looking at the way that ethics and the law interrelate. Certainly, what I would hope to convey to you is the notion that both ethics and the law have an important role to play, not necessarily that the law should be dominate but if we have a good working knowledge of the law then this can only help our day to day practice.

Boundaries of the legal system: Geographic Structural Key Divisions Origins and Language 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN Well, I would like to start is by looking at a content which I supposed as therapist we share with the legal system. And this is the, the notion of boundaries, obviously boundaries are very important within therapy. And this is a, a key part of structure in the work that we do. But also within the legal system, there are key boundaries which come into play. So for example there are significant boundaries or distinctions that apply to the different parts of the legal system within the United Kingdom and these are based on geographic differences. So for example, mainly what I'm gonna be talking about is the law relating to England and Wales. But, there's a separate legal system in Scotland and a separate legal system again in Northern Island. And increasingly there are differences that are emerging between the law within Wales and the law in England. One example would be for example, in Wales there is now a statutory provision for counseling within schools. So that-- although there are broad principles which applied across all four jurisdictions, then, there are significant differences where it's worth being aware of. One illustration of the way in which the law has this differential impact on counseling is that in producing guidance for counselors working in schools, it was necessary to produce separate guidance for counselors working in schools in Scotland, to counselors working in schools in Wales, to counselors working in schools in England. So that's one small example of the way that the, the law is structured differently within the UK. As I say, I'll be talking about broad principles that really apply across the different jurisdictions. There is another boundary which it's very important for us as therapist to, to be aware of and this is the way in which the law is structured. So for example, within the UK, most of the law that's-- I'll be talking about relates to what is known as common law. What is common law? Well, common law is a system of law that has grown up over a long period of time in a very incremental way, so this is really a law made by judges. And within the UK, within United States, within most of the common wealth countries. These are common law, systems law. Now, we might take that for granted but counter pose to that is another very different system of law. And this is where law is based on codes. So rather than looking at a series of decisions of precedence that might have been made by judges and individual cases, you go to a central, authoritative statement about the law and I supposed the origin of this would be in terms of Roman law and more recently Napoleonic law on the continent. And more recently still in terms of the kinds of European community directives that having impact on the UK law. Now, there is a quite a tension between common law system and codes of laws and we can see this in the current debates about the, the Human Rights Act for example and in terms of resistance to what is perceived to be Strasbourg imposing European law upon the UK. So, we-- those tensions are around. There are very different systems of law if we look for example at the European Convention on Human Rights and this was signed by the UK, 1951. And this translates into the Human Rights Act of 1998 if we look at the Data Protection Act 1998. Again, this can be traced back to European directive. So, there is this tension, this, this lack of easy fit if you like between common law systems which are generic, which are homegrown, and then attempts to, to centralized the system of law which come from, from Europe. The other main division that we do need to be aware of is the difference between criminal law and civil law. Again, most of what I will be talking about in this session, most of the law that is relevant to us as counselors and therapists, relates to civil law. And in terms of criminal law, we have a system where an individual is accused of committing an offense, they are innocent until proven guilty, and the result of a conviction could be a fine, it could be-- being sent to prison. So very serious sanctions applied by society. Most of us will be familiar with the standard of proof that's supplied in a criminal case. And this is that the case must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. What does that mean? Well, it means that no reasonable person would doubt that the accused individual has been guilty of the assault whether its fraud or whatever it is that they're accused of. It's a very high standard. Uhm, most of the law that relates to counselling and psychotherapy will be civil law. Civil law has very different structure and system to it. Within civil law, the purpose is really to, to regulate disputes between individuals. So for example, it relates to divorce, it relates to issues about contract, and it's really-- if you like a peaceful way of resolving disputes between different parties. So when a case is heard within a civil court, the case has to be proven not beyond reasonable doubt but on the balance of probabilities. What does this mean? This is a very important legal phase. And it's really that it is probably the case that this happened that for example this child was subject to abuse for example. If it's a civil case rather than a criminal case. So it's a very important distinction, it's a lower threshold because the, the consequences of a criminal conviction are that much more severe and long lasting in many cases. And then finally if we look in terms of some of the, the boundaries and divisions within the legal system. And we only have to look at the language that is used to perceive that this is a very multicultural layered cake of system. So for example, there are bits of law within UK that go back to Roman times. There is the, the Danelaw which came with the, the Danish occupation. There are very important bits of law which came with the Norman occupation, so we have reference to the notion of taught, or negligence. And then more recently, attempts following Woolf reforms of civil law to really bring the law into the 21st century. Now, what is interesting is if we unpack some of the language that is used within the legal system. We find traces of Latin, so there is reference to verdicts which comes from the Latin for verdicary(ph) which is to speak the truth or iuro: I swear. If we go back to Anglo-Saxon times, we have sheriff which comes from shire reeve. And if we really dig deep, then Latin phrases like pro bono which comes from pro bono publico for the public good. Then, we find traces of Roman genealogy. So one way of looking at the legal system is to really see it as quite multicultural, quite layered in terms of the various influences and strains and language that we can still find if we, if we care to look for it.

Broad streams of law: Common law Case law Statute 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN What I want to move on to is talking about different streams of law and I'm gonna suggest and this is very broad branch that effectively there are a three different streams of law that we need to-- at least have a working knowledge of as therapist. First of this is common law, as I've suggested, this is law which is law made judges, it's growing up empirically over a long period of time. A second stream of law is what is known as case law. Case law is where there are individual cases which have very contentious issues to be resolved and often this will work the way up the legal system so they go from one court to an appeal court, in appeal court they may end up in what used to be the House of Lords is now the Supreme Court. And these cases will decide very, very critical issues and in turn these cases become precedent. So, if there's a similar issue to be decided then judges will refer to these precedents in order to get some guidance as to how the case should be heard and decided. So, I'll be talking a bit about case law as it relates to counselling and psychotherapy. The third very broad stream of law is statute. And statute refers to acts of parliament. So this refers to aspects of the law which go through very public, very political process, which go through an initial set of ideas or policy proposals usually known as a Green Paper, the revised, it becomes a White Paper, it becomes a bill. It goes through those committee stages and House of Commons and then the House of Lords. And finally appears as an act of parliament. So this is a very substantial aspect of the law which is really quite distinct from law decided by judges. And again, there are tensions between these different broad streams. 

00:11:55
Common law: Confidence Contract Tort/negligence 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN We're gonna talk about a bit common law to start with. And in relation to common law, there are three main areas that do have an impact on the work that we do. The first of this is what is known as the law of confidence. I mean, we might refer to this as therapist as the law related to confidentiality. Solicitors and lawyers might refer to as the law of confidence, essentially it is the same thing, it is the same, ah, area. So there is within common law a whole series of decisions that have been made, uhm, which don't necessarily relate to acts of parliament but very clear principles that apply to what information as a therapist we may keep to ourselves what information we may have to pass on to, to others. The second border is in terms of contract. And in relation contract, again, we have a whole set of principles established over a long period of time which determine what a contract consist of, what the necessary conditions are, and what the implications are, if there is any kind of the breach of contract. I'm aware that as therapist we do tend to use the term contract as part of our therapeutic language and as a trainer I know that, ah, one sessions on the importance, the necessity of contract and clearly with the client. However, one I'm aware of is that if look at-- if we look at it from a, a narrowly legal point of view, there's-- you know, a very specific conditions that apply to a contract for it to be a legally binding agreement. So, it may will be that although we are working in an organization that we may refer to, to a contract, it may not be a contract in a legal sense. The, the terms and conditions that are required for a contract to exist are first of all that both parties have capacity that is that they are aged over 18, that they're sound mind. Secondly, there's a process of offer and acceptance. Thirdly, that there is an intention to form a legally binding agreement. And then finally, that there is consideration. Ah, consideration we might think is closely related to empathy. No, this is a, a legal concept. And essentially, it's where a service is exchanged usually for money of payment. And the implication of this is that in many situations that as therapist we will be using a term contract in a therapeutic sense but it's not a legally binding contract. So if we work in private practice as a supervisor, as a therapist, if we provide that service to payment then it's a contract. If we work from organization in the NHS, if we work in university or college, then, the chance is not-- it's not a contractual service if the client is not paying us. It's an important distinction because if there is a breach of contract then there is recourse to the small claims court say for example a client has paid for therapy and not received it. Uhm, supervisor has provided a supervision not being paid for then it's possible to, to gain readdressed in the small claims court. The third aspect of common law is that relating to tort which is a French word for wrong and this is the area of professional negligence. And this is, ah, an extreme important area but not one that other looking at in, in great detail in this particular session. 

00:15:45
Case law Werner (1961) Gillick (1985) Gaskin (1989) Tarasoff (1976) (US) Ramona (1994) (US) 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN If we turn to case law, then there are a number of cases which have an impact on us as counselors and psychotherapist. In fact, there are surprisingly few cases within English law if we look to the United States, and there is a vast and have a growing range of, of really quite dramatic cases which impact on the, the work of therapist. The key case that does relate to us within the UK is the case of Werner versus Landau which is talked about separately in this, ah, this DVD. And this was a case for professional negligence and in a nutshell, for a client to bring a case-- successful case for professional negligence they need establish a duty of care on the part of therapist, a breach of that duty of care by the therapist. And thirdly, the most difficult bit to prove is causation of foreseeable harm which is of psychiatric injury. So this is a fairly high threshold to, to establish and so you can imagine. Other case law that relates to us, well, if we work with the children, young people in England and Wales. Children, young people under the age of 16. Then, the key reference point is that of, of Gillick. And the Gillick was heard in 1985, and the effect of Gillick was to open the door to child-centered counselling because the, the Gillick case decided absolutely decisively that a young person under the age of 16 could seek and obtain confidential medical treatment from a health practitioner without having to gain consent of a parent. The wider the condition that supplied is that the young person needs to have sufficient understanding in the eyes of the health practitioner. What is sufficient understanding? You might ask. Well, it's really to have almost an adult understanding of the issues that are involved so to be able weigh the benefits, the disadvantages of a particular cause of treatment and to come to a reasoned decision. So in effect, Gillick has opened the door not just to medical treatment for under 16s but also to, to confidential counselling. Another case that's probably not well-known is that of Graham Gaskin. And I used to be a social worker, and as part of my work with the teenagers in care, very often they would be asking for why they came into care, could they access the file, and my response would always be to say, "Well, whatever you want to know just ask me and I can give you information." But they would often say, "Well, no, I want to read the file." And of course my response was, "In those days, you can't read the file, it's confidential." And it was behind this barrier of confidentiality that I and other social workers were able to practice in a way which may seemed quite strange and remote these days because the recording that went on in certainly in, in counselling records, in medical records was one where the professional could make statements about pa-- patients or clients, very secure in the knowledge that, that would never be read by the people concern. Now, what Graham Gaskin did was to challenge that in number different levels. Now, at one level he went to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and he partially won his case. And it is very interesting, it's roundabout that time that the UK government move from a position that confidentiality meant that these kinds of records could not be disclosed to in quick succession, we had access to social records, access to health records, and access to education records. Suddenly, this door which have been very firmly bolted swung open. And of course, since then we have a system whereby for medics, for nurses, for teachers, and for us as therapist, there is the expectation that if we like records on our times that these are in principle, accessible to those patients or clients. And there's nothing quite astonishes having that as a discipline. So Graham Gaskin and I think needs to be much better known as a very important piece of case law because effectively what you did was to open the door to access to health education and social records by clients and patients throughout the UK. This predates the Data Protection Act of 1998 and it does show that the, the power and effect of particular piece of case law can have and completely changing the terrain of the English legal system. Very briefly, other bits of case law, a couple of this relate to United States, the Tarasoff case, this is one real favor of most counselling tutors often referred to in the Tarasoff case there was client who made threats of harm against his former girlfriend, unfortunately, he acted upon this and murdered his formis-- former girlfriend. His former girlfriend's parents then sued not only him as a therapist but also his employer, the University of California. And the effect of this was produce what was known as the Tarasoff rule and this requires therapist in a number states in United States where threats are made of harm against the third party. There was a legal obligation on the therapist to, to warn this person that, ah, it may be at risk. Now, case law in United States does not immediately translate to case law in the UK and it's unlikely that Tarasoff rules would emerge or would apply, but it's a very important reference point and just considering the responsibility of the individual therapist for protecting individuals who are not party to therapy, third parties. And this might be parents or siblings or other family members or members of the public from harm threatened by a client. And the final case which again is important in the US context is the case of Ramona and this ties in with the very passionate debate in the early 1990s that False Memory Syndrome or Recovered Memory Syndrome. And in this particular case, an individual Holly Ramona was in therapy and the therapist brought in her father through the therapy and the daughter made various allegations or abuse. And so the, the father then sued the therapist for professional negligence and won his case. And again this entail real ripples and warning signs within the therapeutic community, within the states and to certain extent within the UK. But although it had a very profound effect in therapist in United States. There's be no similar kind of case law within the United Kingdom. The legal system in the UK for good or for real does seem to be quite conservative and quite resistant to accepting some of the wider types of litigation that are around in state. So simply because it happens in the states doesn't mean necessarily that it's going to impact on our practice here. 

00:23:40
Statute Mental Health Act 1983, 2007 Children Act 1989, 2004 Data Protection Act 1998 Human Rights Act 1998 Supply of Goods & Services Act 1982 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN In terms of statute moving onto the, the third area, then depending upon where we work, the setting in which we work depending upon the nature of the client group that we work with. Then, it's important that we be aware of different acts of parliament. So for example if we're working with mental health issues, if we work in a psychiatric setting, then we need to be aware of the Mental Health Act 1983, updated in 2007. If we work with children, clearly then we need a working knowledge of the Children Act 1989, 2004. All therapist need to get a grip to the Data Protection Act 1998. Now, this is not an easy task, it's a complex piece of legislation. Fortunately, usually where we have major act of parliament then there will be a code of practice, there will be if you like a working manual of how we understand and apply the acting practice. I know that very often as therapist that we might be tempted to, to look up the law often it's quite dense, it's written by lawyers, the parliamentarians, it's not an easy read. But in almost every case, there will be for example the code of practice with the Mental Health Act which will tell you in user friendly language what it is that you need to do working in the mental health sector. In the case of the Children Act, then, there was the document working together and again this is downloadable and it spells out in the kind of detail which will be useful to us as practitioners what it is that we need to be aware of and what we need to do. Other bits of legislation that we, we need to be aware of, the Human Rights Act. Again, this is important with regard to the clients right to, to privacy. And consumer legislations such as the Supply of Goods and Services Act. 

00:25:40
Ethical Principles: Autonomy Welfare (Beneficence) Avoiding Harm (Non-Maleficence) Trust (Fidelity) Justice Self-respect 

00:25:40
DR. KENNETH DUCKWORTH What I want to do is to move on to try to link together some of the, the key ethical principles relating to counselling and psychotherapy and see how this translate into the, the legal concepts that might be used within the kind of, ah, areas of conflict or difficulty or professional dilemmas that we, we might be facing. So within the BACP Ethical Framework, we have six ethical principles which are to, to guide and to, to reinforce our everyday practice. And the first of this is the notion of autonomy and this relates to-- if we want to use a person-centered language this would be the self-actualization of the client. This will be their, their right to be self-determining to make choices which is really at the heart of therapy. And a second principle is that all beneficence or might as well described as welfare so that whatever we do as the therapist hopefully will be for the well-being, the positive outcomes which relate to the individual client in front of us but also within society as a whole but therapy makes a positive contribution to the wider world in which we work and practice. Counterpose to this almost you know, the opposite side of the coin is the notion of avoiding harm. So we need to be cautious as therapist in terms of our interventions, in terms of our responses to be careful that what we do does not harm the individual client or indeed doesn't cause harm to the third parties outside the, the therapeutic frame. And the, uhm, the wider, the longer term to use is, is non-maleficence. So we have these two twin linked principles of welfare and avoiding harm. The, the fourth of the BACP Ethical Principles is that a trust and this relates to holding and maintaining confidence with the client, confidentiality so the therapist is the container if you like for the, the secret material, the, the personal, uhm, very meaningful material that the, the client discloses to them. And needs to work to, to earn that trust and to, to maintain relationship as far as possible. If we look at counselling within a wider social frame, then the fifth ethical principle of justice means that we should provide services then without, uhm, favor to particular individuals, we shouldn't discriminate against individuals on any particular grounds. And that we need to consider wider issues in terms of access to a counselling service or, uhm, equality of provision. Now the final principle is probably have been the most controversial and most contentious of all those added to this, this list and that is of self-respect. And this is the idea that as therapist we need to look after ourselves, that we need to take good care of our, our physical and mental health. We need to update our professional practice. We need to take part in CPD, Continuing Professional Development supervision, personal therapy, etcetera, etcetera. So these are the ethical principles which are highlighted in the ethical framework, they don't simply apply to BACP members, and this come from a biomedical background and they are seem to apply broadly across all the helping professions. 

00:29:40
Ethical Principles (BACP) Autonomy Welfare (Beneficence) Avoiding Harm (Non-Maleficence) Trust Justice Self Respect Legal Concepts Contract Informed Consent Duty of Care Standard of Care Duty of confidence Non-discrimination Pre-conditions necessary to fulfill duty to apply reasonable care and skill 

00:29:40
DR. KENNETH DUCKWORTH What I want to do in this final closing sequence is to try to link some of the ethical principles with the ways in which the law might look at therapeutic practice. So what are the pressure points? What are the areas where, ah, a working knowledge of law might be relevant and helpful to us as therapist. So, if we look at the notion of autonomy, then I would imagine from a legal point of view the two key concepts which would really be relevant here. First of all the notion of contract. So, within the, the concept of our, our contract from a legal sense, the individual, the client can make a choice as to whether or not they're going to engage in therapy, they can choose whether or not they're going to pay the therapist fee. And they can bring their decision-making to bear upon that. As I suggested earlier, it may well be that a number of us are using contract in a therapeutic sense rather than a strictly legal sense. But the same principles would, would broadly apply to the notion of, of client choice and self-determination. The other area is in relation to informed consent. Now, there isn't an established body of law within the, the English legal system that relates to this in great detail. But within the NHS, the notion of informed consent has become a critical importance in relation to the, the way that patients are able to, to access services. And informed consent really requires that an individual has information that they can look at the advantages and disadvantages of a certain course action and make a reasoned choice. So that broad expectation of informed consent would apply within the, the whole field of offering therapy to, to clients. In terms of welfare, the notion that we need to work for the positive outcomes of the therapy, the positive benefit of the individual client, the wider good within society. The ways that a solicitor for example might understand this or translate this to a legal concept would be in terms of the notion, the duty of care. What is a duty of care? Well, a duty care is in the legal sense to work to accepted professional standards relating to the area of practice. So the, the notion that duty of care is to work to-- sort of the expectations of perhaps the code of ethics, or code of conduct and to comply with competent respective professional opinion relating to that, that form of therapy. The, the third ethical principle is that of avoiding harm or non-maleficence. Now, looked that from a legal perspective. I think this relates to a number of different things. Firstly, there is the notion of the, the standard of care. To put it more bluntly, it is how bad does a therapist have to be before they fall foul of judgment of their, their competence in a legal sense. Now, the test that is applied is the Bolam test, this is taken from medical case law. And perhaps reassuringly the notion is that as a therapist, the therapist who is ordinarily competent, who works within the mainstream is above this particular threshold. So if somebody falls below the standard of care to be expected, the ordinary competent professional then they would be failing this test, the Bolam test. The other aspect that we do need to consider is whether or not as therapist in terms of avoiding harm, whether we have responsibility to, you know, just a client but also to third parties perhaps not in the counselling room, perhaps the siblings, parents, children who may be at risk. And this would be the whole area of whether or not we have a legal duty to warn others regarding risk by the client that we're working with. The fourth ethical principle is that of trust and I would see this is relating very strongly to the law of confidence as law as-- therapist we tend to talk more about the law relating to confidentiality. But this is our obligation to, to keep private, to keep contained and confidential. A very personal private material that is disclosed to us by our client. Obviously, there are exceptions to this and in some situations where we do have to pass information on or we can make particular choice. In terms of justice, it is important as counselors that we're aware that we work within a wider social frame and to avoid discriminating against clients on grounds of gender, age, sexual orientation, rights, and all the conditions that apply. But also that we are aware of potential discrimination against clients in terms of accessing the service. That we provide other individually or as an organization. So what I've been trying to do here is to try to translate the ethical principles that we're all very familiar with, with legal concepts which would be applied to a practice. The most difficult linkage for me and it-- this exercise has been in terms of the ethical principle of self-respect. This seems to be the, the hardest if you like to translate into, ah, a legal paradigm, a legal framework. The best example I can come up with is the notion that if we provide a counselling or psychotherapy service for payment, then we are obliged to do this with reasonable care and skill and this is under consumer protection legislation. So whether we're a plumber or whether we're a psychotherapist, then if we're offering our services for payment to the public, then we have to know what we're doing and we have to work to the accepted relevant standards. So this is for you to, to bring this session to a close but what I'm trying to do within this is to look at some of the ways in which the law impacts on our practice as therapist in covering everything from case law, common law, to statute and relating this to ethical principles. Thank you.
