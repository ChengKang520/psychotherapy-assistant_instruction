00:00:00
 Everyone if we could, ah, be, be quiet please. We're gonna begin our, our presentation, a dialogue between Christine Padesky and Martin Seligman. And it's gonna be about cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. 

00:00:15
 Louder, please. 

00:00:20
 Louder. 

00:00:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN Say it again. 

00:00:20
 They, they want it louder for them to hear it. 

00:00:20
 Okay. So, we need to raise the volume. Ah, hello everyone. Welcome to our presentation between Christine Padesky and Martin Seligman, a dialogue on der-- and between cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. So, please welcome them and we will begin. 

00:00:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hello, I'm-- well, let's see. 

00:00:50
 Would you like to take mine? Here. 

00:00:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Okay. 

00:00:50
 I can fix that. 

00:00:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hello. 

00:00:55
 Here. Take this and I'll help, help you fix this. 

00:01:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hello, I'm Christine Padesky and, ah, I'm representing kind of, ah, the mix between cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. 

00:01:10
 Hello. 

00:01:15
 Sound. 

00:01:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Can you hear me? 

00:01:15
 No. 

00:01:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Didn't-- get you get that one on? 

00:01:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN More, more volume, eh. 

00:01:15
 Yes, it strains the volume a little bit. 

00:01:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN Can you hear me? 

00:01:20
 Yes. 

00:01:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:01:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN Okay. 

00:01:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Okay. 

00:01:20
 Can you raise the volume for Chris? 

00:01:25
MARTIN SELIGMAN Can you raise your volume for Chris? 

00:01:25
 Yeah. 

00:01:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY All right. Thank you. Okay. Good. I actually started graduate school 40 years ago - 

00:01:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN No. 

00:01:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes, I did it, Marti. It's hard to believe. And, ah,-- maybe 39 and a half years ago. Does that make you feel any better? 

00:01:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:01:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Ah, when I started graduate school, they asked us in our first year what we wanted to study and what we-- to start thinking about our research for our-- prepare for dissertation quickly. And I was in UCLA and I said, "Well, what I'm most interested in is I wanna study coping cuz the question that interests me is why don't more people get depressed and anxious? Why do most people stay healthy?" And I got a blank stare from the faculty and no one would agree to work with me on that question. And so, I ended up partnering with Connie Herman and doing some research on depression because that was an acceptable topic and you can appreciate this because you at that time were doing learn helplessness research. So, it was a very, very different environment in psychology. And, fortunately, my work with her in depression led me a few years later to meet up Aaron T. Beck and that was very good because he was a cognitive-- he was starting cognitive therapy and you know Tim very well as I do. And he, he has always been interested in people's strengths and positive qualities and he has a very nice way of finding that in people. So, I found in cognitive therapy a home where I could really for look for the good people while I was doing psychotherapy and working on depression, anxiety, etcetera. And-- but my interest has continued over the years and so, when you really took the leadership role and starting to launch and make positive psychology very visible around the world, I was so excited because I thought now I can finally say why do most people, you know-- how do most people cope well and what do people do well. But, by this time, I was also very active as a cognitive behavioral therapist and I was already injecting a lot of interesting strengths in the cognitive therapy that I did. And about 20 years ago-- 15 or 20 years ago, Kathleen Mooney and I started saying, you know, the CBT methods that are so good for helping depression and anxiety maybe similar methods could be used to actually help create positive qualities. So, I started working on a model of how would you help someone become more resilient or more altruistic or more compassionate. And we've come up with a four-step model to do that that we can talk about if you like. And also, o-- over the years we've come up with-- ah, for the last 20 years, I've been very interested in working with personality disorders. But looking at personality disorders as not a pathology, ah, which that language implies, but looking at it as people are trying to cope and do, do-- they do things for good reasons. And if we can understand people's good reasons for doing things, maybe we could help to make shifts that are bigger than what psychotherapy usually expects. And so, we've developed a model for working with chronic difficulties where instead of trying to dismantle negative patterns, we instead help people imagine and visualize how they would like to be. And we find that if people really fully imagine how would they like to be that we can help them get their much more quickly we think, than by dismantling negative systems that you could just ignore the negative system and build toward something more positive. So, it's very interesting cuz I think what you've done Marti and the-- I'll let you comment on this as I think in some ways you have at a very big level looked at signatures or strengths in PERMA. And, and they're really broad, global, macro view of positive psychology. And in some ways, I've been approaching from another direction a very organic individual ground up. How do you work with an individual person and help them become aware of their strengths more and begin to bring their strengths more out in their daily life in a way that helps them to live a happier life? So, I'm-- I welcome having this dialogue with you - 

00:06:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN You know - 

00:06:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY - this evening. 

00:06:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN - that seems great be up here with you Chris after all the stuff you've done in the last 40 years. 

00:06:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:06:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN Ah, uhm, the question of the relationship of positive psychology to cognitive behavior therapy and the therapy general-- generally is a very interesting question. And, and, and it's gonna talk-- or I don't know the answer to it. I'll talk around it a bit. Ah, just to start off with my-- in the lecture history, ah, positive psychology was what I really always wanted to do but it didn't exist. And so, I went in the directions of the things that did exist. I-- ah, in my own life when I was, ah, 14 years old-- 12 years old, my sister brought home from college Freud's 24 introductory lectures and I read the part of that teeth falling out dreams. Do you remember, remember what they mean? Yeah, teeth falling. How many of you don't remember what Freud said teeth falling out dreams were? 

00:07:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY I do. 

00:07:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh, it was guilt over masturbation and, ah, the worry that you're father would castrate you in retaliation. So, I said, "How does he know me so well? Uhm, and so, I wanted to spend my life having insights like that. Ah, and, ah, indeed in high school I read, ah, Lindner's Fifty-Minute Hour - 

00:07:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:07:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and again, ah, this what I wanted to do. But it really wasn't quite what I wanted to do. You know, what I was after was what was positive in life and not just the absence of it. And, and it, it really as important not to gloss over this. So the model that we've worked in that Chris was been and I think struggling against and I've been struggling against is the Schopenhauer-Freud model which basically said that the best you could ever do in life was not to suffer. So, ah, success in life was holding miserably to zero. Now, I think that you is empirically false, morally insidious, and a therapeutic dead-end. Cuz I think when people come to us-- and by the way, the-- most of you in this room are much more of a therapist than I am so I do prevention and health and things like that these days. And so, when I talk about therapy, take it with a real grain of salt. But when I did therapy, it was common for people to come to me and say, "I wanna be happy." 

00:08:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:08:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN And I've been trained by Tim. I said, "Oh, you mean, you don't wanna be depressed?" That was an instance of, "Doctor, I hope you can cure what I have." "Oh, Mister, I hope you have what I can cure." So, the presence of happiness I've come to believe is not-- is much more than the absence of misery. And what draws me in this direction was to read about Freud's studies which actually correlated depression with happiness, life satisfaction, and other measures. I assume from Freud and Schopenhauer and the model in which we worked, pathology model, that the correlation was -1.0. Correlation is actually about -2.0 which is to say, ah, you, your client, your children can both be happy and depressed probably not at the same time. And what's more than that, I think the tools of well-being are much more and different from the tools of not being miserable. And so, I think, ah, well-being is a presence. And, for me as I envision, ah, if you will holistic therapy of the future, it's arming the people we love and clients both with the tools for combating dysphoria or thought disorder, but arming them with the tools for building positive emotions and engagement and great relationships and meaning. Those are two complementary jobs. And when real people come to us, they want both. 

00:10:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Exactly. I would agree with you Marti. And some people asked me because I'm very involved now on strengths-based CBT, why do I still teach you know, the evidence-based models for depression and anxiety? But the, the reason is those are very good models when people really are ailing. But I think that by-- one of the things that hasn't been explicitly done that a really good CBT therapist do-- I've worked a lot with Tim Beck over the years and I think he genuinely is interested in people's happiness and he always attended to that in therapy. But it's not been so explicitly written and so people don't understand that, that can be and is a legitimate and an important part of therapy. One of the things that we found is that if we identify positive interest in strengths in the very first session with people and we incorporate and ask about it and include these in the conversation of therapy throughout, that we really can't broaden the focus of therapy. So that the fo-- focus isn't just on if they do comment depress-- treating depression but it's really on improving their quality of life and finding out what would make them happy. And some-- with some people, we may purely be able to work on the constructing of happiness, ah, with other people we may need to work on getting rid of depression before we can work on constructing happiness. 

00:12:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. I, I think, I think mi-- misery trumps happiness. Ah, ah, we're bad weather animals. 

00:12:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:12:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN We, we evolved during a Pleistocene, ah, in which what really mattered was catastrophizing well. You know, it may look like a nice day in Anaheim today but, ah, the ice was coming. And, and that-- that's what our brain is about. If, if you think about your tongue, ah, the default motion of your tongue is to swish around your mouth 24 hours a day until it finds a cavity or a hole in the gum, ah, and then it-- where is it? Your tongue does not swish around the mouth until it finds up really nice tooth. And I think I'll spend the couple of minutes on the tooth. And the mind and emotion, because of our Pleistocene evolution, is about finding what's wrong. Now, I think that's fine if the Ice Age is coming but, in fact, it's gonna be a nice day in Anaheim tomorrow. And if we are so crippled by a Pleistocene in brain which can only see what's gonna go wrong, we can't have a positive emotion engagement, good relationships. I mean, we can't enjoy what is good in life. So, I think it's very important to recognize that the positive side of life is a real thing if not just the absence of a bad effect. And we've haven't been explicitly trained to work on the positive side of life. Uhm, now, clinicians and their wisdom have always worked on the positive side of life and have known that, but there are great advantages to having a theory, to having evidence-based, ah, moves that work into the measurement of the positive side of life. 

00:14:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:14:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN And I think that's, that's where come wholistic therapy will have to go. 

00:14:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. And I-- one of the things that I'd like to get your reflections on that we've observed that I find really interesting is when we've you know, worked-- and I've been working in CBT for many years and we've worked to develop models for understanding disorder like panic disorder, OCD, or depression, we end up having these pretty direct models. This leads to this, leads to this and you know, then you can have different models and test them out. But what's really exciting to me about positive-- developing positive qualities. Is there's no single pathway? Ah, for instance, for resilience, one person may become resilient through their spiritual faith and their commitment to helping other people and other person may-- maybe resilient because of their, ah, creative problem-solving or their sense of humor, and other person may use social relationships really well and that helps them in time of distress, bounce back and recover. So, one of the things that we found really important in our models for helping people develop resilience for us as therapists not to have a narrow idea of what resilience is. But instead to be able to look at people and help them look at their life and see how they are-- what's their natural form of resilience. And to accept that and, and that's very exciting. And I have to tell you one thing that we found that may link up to your research and I imagine that it does. Is that we found instead of looking it big things in people's like if you're gonna figure out what's your personal mode of resilience, you might think-- well, do you Marti tell me about some of the hardest time you faced and how did you go through them. But actually, we found the best place to helo uncover people's natural resilience is to ask about something they do everyday or nearly everyday that they look forward to doing. And we talked to them something that they enjoy and we then do and active search for strengths. The things that's nice about how life works is if you, for example, ah, you like to play bridge, are you? Yeah. I, I thought you're a bridge player. So, if you like to play bridge, and this is something you really have fun doing. I would interview you about that. And first, I would just show interest in your playing bridge so that you relax and start to get in to your bridge playing mind. And then, I would say to you, "Now, what are some of the difficulties you're running to when you're playing bridge?" And you might talk about or sometimes they get paired the partner who uses a different convention system than I do or sometimes... 

00:16:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh, you're a bridge player. 

00:16:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. Or so-- you know, might have something you know, different, ah, obstacles that you face. And I would say, "Marti, when that happens, how do you handle that? How did you get through that? What did you do?" Now, the interesting thing is when you're doing something you enjoy, you don't think about being resilient. You don't even pay much attention to obstacles cuz you're in-- you're so motivated. You naturally works your way through them. But in interviewing you, I could find out what you do in this kind of optimal areas of your life to handle obstacles cuz they'll always be there. And then we can develop what we called "personal model resilience" and then I might say, "Now, Marti, how can you use your bridge playing skills when you're on this other area where you have more struggles?" And we find that people get very engaged with that and they immediately starts clicking in and, uhm,-- so this is where I'm taking-- approaching this from another-- the other side of things from you as I'm looking it little organic everyday experiences that people don't even think as connected to strength. And yet strengths are embedded everywhere within them. 

00:17:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Good one. I, I finally found a difference in a way we think - 

00:17:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:17:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY - and it's around the word resilience. 

00:17:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:17:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, like you are, I also work on resilience as well. 

00:17:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:17:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN But resilience means coming back or compensating for something negative. 

00:17:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:17:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN Okay, so I'm trying to say there's a lot more to if I may presume, ah, therapy to your own life then just coming back from the negative. Now, there's not only a dashboard and many roots to resilience, but positive psychology in my hands is defined by what are the elements that people who aren't suffering choose, ah, that contribute to well-being and they're done for their own sake. So, for me, and these are not resilience terms, they're five of them, PERMA. Positive emotion, P, engagement, E, good relationships, R, meaning and purpose, M, and accomplishment, A. Now, t he same thing that you said-- here was something that we do agree on-- so - 

00:18:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:18:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN - I, I put a parenthesis around this. For me, you're not just trying to-- in your own life be better at coming back from bad stuff. You're actually trying to do good stuff - 

00:19:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:19:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Even if that doesn't involve coming back from anything at all. Ah, you know, pretty in line around that. The five elements that I think people choose that constitute well-being share the property of resilience and that there are many paths to it, P, E, R, M, and A. Ah, on an airplane dashboard, there are a whole bunch of gages. Ah, there's no one number that tells you how well the airplane is doing. It depends on the mission of the airplane. So, if it's trying to get from New York to Los Angeles and use as little fuel as possible, then headwinds and map are really important. If you're trying to make as comfortable a ride for your passengers as possible, then radar and going around thunderstorms are a bit important, ah, and so on and so forth. Well, the human phi-- the-- there's no one number that tells you how a human being is doing for well-being. There's no one PERMA number-- you're-- it's not the sum of P, E, R, M, and A. So, some people are hideous and their life is about pursuing pleasure. Ah, some people, ah, I'm one of those, ah, engagement people. So, for me, what really matters is being one with the music. Some people are relationship people. 

00:20:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:20:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN Ah, some people are very hype M people. So, the question is as a therapist, what is your role in this if you take seriously the notion of increasing your well-being or your patient's well-being? Well, I think it's to find out what they value. So, what their hideous. Your job is not to tell them you know, meaning is really a better of thing than pleasure seeking - 

00:21:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN - ah, but rather than to tell them that near bunch of tips on how you can have more pleasure in life. But you can also tell them the date of that, ah,-- I mean people tend tend in the long running to have more life satisfaction. Ah, so I think the bottom line of the way we engage a person as a client or a nation, so it is a big question about how you measure a nation's well-being has to do with what the values of the person are. 

00:21:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN And then our job is to help people implement their values - 

00:21:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and not change what their values are. Ah... 

00:21:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY I'm, I'm sorry Marti, I didn't hear in what you sai what you disagreed - 

00:21:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh. 

00:21:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY - on me on the resilience - 

00:21:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN So. 

00:21:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY - so... 

00:21:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Resilience is for me a term from psychology as usual. 

00:21:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:21:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, it's what we were trained to do. Now, those have positive stuff in it because you're going from minus A to minus three, but you're not going, you know, -- and when you lie in bed at night, you're generally not thinking about minus A to minus two. We're thinking about plus three to plus five in life. So, plus three to plus five in life. So, I measure my own PERMA and I discovered that if I spend an hour a day listening to the Berlin Philharmonic, they are just fantastic Berlin Philharmonic archive for 13-- $20 a month and it's wonderful. A whole, ah, I spent an hour a day listening to Berlin Philharmonic. My life went better. Ah, that wasn't resilience from anything, that was adding a positive element - 

00:22:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Right. 

00:22:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN - into my life. 

00:22:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Right. 

00:22:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN Assessing my life in that area. Yeah. 

00:22:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY I, I would agree that those are two separate things but I-- I'm not sure they're completely different. And that-- a-- and let's go back to you as a bridge player. 

00:22:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yes. 

00:22:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY If you start to develop this model of yourself as a bridge player, and then supposed there's some very unpleasant committee meetings at the university that you have to attend, and if you can then think about going into those committee meetings and approaching them as a bridge game, would that not increase your PERMA during those - 

00:23:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh. 

00:23:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY - meetings? 

00:23:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Ah, ah, I think it wouldn't decrease my misery in the committee. 

00:23:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY It wouldn't increase your PERMA. 

00:23:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN Well, I think it was an important distinction, so, ah, I'm interested in chronic pain - 

00:23:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and, ah, I'm interested in relationship of happiness to paying. 

00:23:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN And so we put undergraduates' feet in ice water and, ah, ah,-- well, let me preface it with bridge. So, the average age of bridge players in the United States is now my age, around 70. 

00:23:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:23:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, the people I play bridge with are in pain - 

00:23:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:23:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN - that they have arthritis and rheumatism and bad illnesses. They're not in pain when they play bridge. 

00:23:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN They are in pain between sections. 

00:23:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:23:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN We put undergraduates' feet ice water and we say, "When it becomes excruciating take your foot out." In the average undergraduate, it's about 80 seconds - 

00:23:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:23:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN - before the pain have—is excruciating. If you give them a video game to play - 

00:24:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:24:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN - they keep their feet on ice water for 4 minutes. 

00:24:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:24:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN Now, that's an example of resilience. That's where you using a positive technique as an end run around something nasty. And I'm all for that you know. 

00:24:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:24:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN I think it's a major ingredient of therapy in our own life. But there's also something else and that's increasing non-- non-resilient in ha-- increasing the level of PERMA in your life. 

00:24:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:24:25
MARTIN SELIGMAN - which I think is non-resilient. So, I think it's part of our job - 

00:24:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY I, ah, I do. 

00:24:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN - as therapists and educators. 

00:24:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY I would agree. I'll, I'll tell you a personal story about that one of the things that I have to do several times a week has go to the post office. And when we first moved our office about 13 years ago, the post office was one of the most miserable places in our city. Ah, the postal clerks were dower and the people were irritated. They had to wait in line. And so, at that time, we were developing some of the things we might get into talking about, about what therapists could do to - 

00:25:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:25:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY - help people develop positive ideas. And one of them is the therapeutic smile. So, I decided I would - 

00:25:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh. 

00:25:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY - test out some of my ideas in the post office. So, when I would go to the post office, I would walk in and I would you know, see someone I would smile. And I would-- the clerks have all their names so I would say to the clerk-- I'd say, "Hi, Ron, how are you today? My name is Christine." And I would to introduce myself. Well, the first week I did this, they were you know, looked at me in scans. Second week I did this, they slightly smiled back. The third week I did this, they were like-- I barely got in the door, "Hey, Christine! How are doing?" By the fourth week I did this, not only they were greeting me but everybody in the post office was smiling and talking to each other including the people in line. 

00:25:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Now, this really-- I thought this is really terrific. You know, we can have such powerful effect on our environment by such a tiny, tiny intervention and-- which cost us nothing and helps us feel good in the process. 

00:25:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN Uhm... 

00:26:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY So, this was-- so this to me is psychology in action as I'm very interested in it. 

00:26:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Well, i-- if I can presume and give a group like this, ah, some advice about therapy, let me try it, it's down this line. Ah, so, I've spent about a decade and probably about $5 million doing, ah, random assignments placebo-controlled tests of psychotherapy and drugs and different psychotherapeutic moves. And when-- that's what I used to before I started working on positive psychology. So I'm-- and then when I started working on positive psychology, I asked are there techniques of raising PERMA, ah, that do it reliably. And, by the way, just historically, one reason people from the therapeutic community like myself didn't work on happiness was the study by Phil Brickman when we were much younger and nearly 70s and which Phil followed 14 people who won the lottery in Illinois - 

00:27:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:27:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and measure their happiness and life satisfaction. And he found that for the first few months, it went up but then it reverted back to where it was. That led a lot of us to think that happiness and life satisfaction were fraught in the cappuccino. And what really, really wanted was - 

00:27:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:27:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN - to work on the cappuccino. Well, it turns out Phil was wrong. 

00:27:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:27:25
MARTIN SELIGMAN And it turns out that well-being, life satisfaction PERMA can be lastly increased. And so, I've spent a lot of time and money fi-- and-- what I mean, the upshot of that research program. Ah, you-- rigorously at evidence-based researches, there are about 12 techniques which reliably increase, ah, life satisfaction and decrease de-- depression and things like using your highest strength at work, ah, very much incorporated in what you do, making gratitude visits and the like, and that's nice. But there really only about 12 of this. So, where does that leave a therapist? Well, here's something new that I've been thinking about for the last year and it's the Adam Smith, ah, invisible hand argument. Ah, let's just think about how-- what this is and how you can use it in therapy. I'm gonna say that all, all PERMA is local and all interventions are local. And there are maybe 12 global interventions that work. But the real interventions are local. Now, I will give you the background on this. So, ah, ah, I'm on, ah, Prime Minister Cameron has measures the well-being of England and has said he will hold himself accountable for the success or failure of public policy not just by increases in GDP and unem-- unem--- employment but by increases in well-being. Okay. Well, that's very good. Uhm, and, ah, indeed I'm on statistical committee and we make I think 200,000 phone calls every three, three months and we ask people, ah, about their well-being. And so, so far so good. But what's really important about what they're doing is they're publishing data. Now, consider the following. Let's say you're measuring the PREMA, the well-being of cashiers in Boots and cashier in Sainsbury. And cashiers in Boots earn the same amount of money as cashiers in Sainsbury. But the well-being of the cashiers on Boots is significantly higher. What does Adam Smith tell us happens? 

00:29:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:29:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN The people in Sainsbury will say gonna have to make this job more fun. 

00:29:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:29:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN We're gonna have to do local things, Google-like things at Sainsbury to compete. It's not gonna be things like making gratitude visits, it can be things like ping-pong tables and free sushi and the like. Now bu-- here's the, the lesson here. Once you say that PERMA is a value in your life and you measure it. So, let say, you decide that your goal with your husband is to increases PERMA. And you're gonna measure it. So, you measure it in week one. You're gonna wi-- you know your husband a lot better than Chris or I could. You're gonna find he likes orchids. You're gonna find ways of increasing his PERMA. So, one should decide it to value and you measure it, then you do the local interventions to do it. So, what might a therapeutic measure meaning of that be? Not just gratitude visit but let 's measure your PERMA - 

00:30:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:30:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and when you come back next week, ah, I want your PERMA to be higher. I don't know how to do it. Ah, I did this in my undergrad-- my graduates' seminar two weeks ago. So, we measured everyone's PERMA, 20 of us, and I said, "Eh, when you come back next seminar in two weeks, I want your PERMA to be higher." 

00:31:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:31:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN And su-- sure, sure enough, you know, it's a no control group, but people-- you know, I found ways to listen to the Berlin Philharmonic more. So the lesson for me here is that the, the therapeutic alliance with the patient dreaming up the interventions and measuring that will produce increased PERMA. 

00:31:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yes. And I would agree with that. And, and what we found is that if your-- I think measurement is important because we know anything that measures-- that we measure is likely to increase - 

00:31:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:31:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY - if-- because people become aware of it and they - 

00:31:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:31:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY - think of it. The other thing that's really important that I wanna say to the therapists who were here today is that we found certain changes in therapists' behavior are really important. One of the worst things that we've been trained in as therapists is to be neutral in doing our therapy work with people, having a neutral face, being you know-- having neutral expressions. If we're talking to people about building in something new or something positive, a neutral face is, is actually a negative intervention. 

00:32:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:32:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY If I say to you, "Tell me something that you really want," and I say it to you that way, "Tell me something that you really want," versus if I say to you, "Tell me something you really want." 

00:32:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:32:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY One of the things that we are working in our training seminars with therapists on is how to genuinely smile and show curiosity and interest with enthusiasm to clients. Because when we ask clients, you know, "What do you envision? What would make you happy? What do you want?" If we ask that with a neutral face, we are-- the clients are gonna say, "I don't know." 

00:32:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:32:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY But if we encourage clients with a smile and curiosity and our own willingness to take a risk and you know, be a real human being and, and show some enthusiasm and actually say, "You know, I want you to get some of these things that you want in your life." 

00:33:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN Be... 

00:33:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY I'd like to work with you to get them. 

00:33:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:33:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY And some therapists get very uncomfortable at saying that sort of thing to people. 

00:33:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN We were taught that therapy is a serious business. It's about - 

00:33:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:33:25
MARTIN SELIGMAN - your alleviation and misery and suffering. 

00:33:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah, that's right. 

00:33:25
MARTIN SELIGMAN But it's not appropriate to laugh and smile. 

00:33:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY That's right. 

00:33:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN Now, this is maybe an important distinction between positive interventions and in-- or interventions as usual - 

00:33:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:33:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN - that i-- it might be hard for me to smile my way through getting you to talk about your most catastrophic thoughts. 

00:33:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY And that would be inappropriate. 

00:33:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Inappropriate. 

00:33:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. It would be. 

00:33:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN I mean, it's a serious business. 

00:33:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:33:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN But to talk about your ideal self, - 

00:33:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:33:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN - what your highest strengths are, the, the misery persona which is not appropriate. So, maybe that in-- you discovered a general thing. 

00:34:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:34:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, there are at least a dozen positive - 

00:34:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:34:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN - interventions. I wonder if they all don't work better smiling. 

00:34:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY I think they probably do. 

00:34:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah, I bet they do. 

00:34:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY I bet they do. 

00:34:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Could. 

00:34:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY We could do - 

00:34:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Good, good research - 

00:34:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Let's do a study on that. 

00:34:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - and we can do that. Yeah. I'm sure it having. 

00:34:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY That will be good - 

00:34:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:34:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY - because that would be exciting. Cuz I think that they do it in. And actually one of the bits of research that we discovered is kinda by happenstance but we-- it-- our belief in it, it has strengthen since-- I read a footnote in an article a number of years ago, ah, about the amygdala. And it was, you know, amygdala-- our amygdala get activated as a dangerous sensor. And when our amygdala are activated, we're not very open to new learning and creativity in our acts. We're on danger, you know, alert mode. And there-- it's-- once our amygdala gets activated, they, they quiet very slowly. But there are-- is one thing that we can do to quiet the amygdala a very quickly and it turns out it's the human smile. And it has to be a genuine smile. It can't just be the mouth going up, it has to be the eyes. 

00:34:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:34:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY I tell therapists smile with your eyes. Have a little-- feel the twinkle in your eye because that's what a genuine smile is. And when you genuinely smile at some of the twinkle in your eye, it takes the danger out of the situation and it opens people up to those more positive creative parts of themselves. 

00:35:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN It will, it will brings up the-- for 120 years, we've had this premise that if you can't get people to talk about what's wrong, their misery that somehow that was gonna make better. 

00:35:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:35:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN And you know, that's never been tested. 

00:35:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:35:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN And e-- even though it works, the control group of getting people to talk about what they're good at, what their ideal self is, what their strengths are, uhm, it-- we've somehow come to this notion that good therapeutic alliance is around misery. But if, if you went to a dance or a bar and you want to make friends with someone, to talk about what your most ashamed of, guilty about, that's not what the way you make friends. But people, people make frien-- people are m-- wh-- one thing true of, of all the negative, all the discourteous, are they close you. 

00:36:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:36:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN They're not good tools for learning. So, if you just think about when a baby is scared or screaming, ah, they don't explore the world. You pull back on what you already know. The evidence is really clear if you want people to learn something, you want them in a state of high well-being. Uhm, I, I mentioned just, ah, an hour ago that about four years ago I was consulting to the, ah, European Space Agency and planning, ah, three-year mission to Mars. There were 80 psychologists there. So, the question was, how do you have a successful six people co-ed crew, three-year 90-minute lead and communication to Mars? Seventy-nine of them were-- 79 of my colleagues were talking about mutiny, what do you if you wanna kill the captain, suicide in space, panic and fear? And I said, you know, in a space mission, the evidence is very clear that if you want people to work well, they work well when their well-being is high. And, you know, there's a difficulty if I wanna strangle the captain. You need 45 minutes to Houston and 45-- don't do that. That's not gonna help much. But the question of building well-being in space, ah, how you do that? Seem to me really and much or at least - 

00:37:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Absolutely. 

00:37:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN - as important as the, the, the therapeutic questions in space. 

00:37:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY I don't wanna be on the well-being flight. I don't wanna be - 

00:37:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY - on the strangled fight. Yeah. 

00:37:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, the question of sex opened up. 

00:37:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:37:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN And, ah... 

00:38:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY And love. 

00:38:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN Well, sex and love and playing poker and bridge - 

00:38:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:38:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN - in space. So, ah, apparently there have been huge disasters on missions like - 

00:38:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:38:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - Antarctic missions, Himalayan missions, ah, oversex and it's apparently a third rail issue - 

00:38:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:38:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN - at NASA and, ah, ah, I-- I've never seen a good discussion of sex in space. You know, three years or six, high testosterone people, what are you gonna do? 

00:38:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah, yeah. It sounds-- you, you get the most interesting - 

00:38:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN I do. 

00:38:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY - job as senators Marti. 

00:38:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:38:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Ah, yeah - 

00:38:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN I wonder, ah, cuz... 

00:38:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY - should we, should we open it up for - 

00:38:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:38:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY - the style. We can talk to each other when we're hugging, ah... 

00:38:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN And I'm better for you-- we open it up, come to a microphone. I will come out and join you. 

00:38:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:38:45
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 INNER CALIFORNIA NEVO2013 

00:38:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN If you have, have a question, just appear to microphone. 

00:38:55
 Tonight, can I ask the question? So, ah, things do reach? So, it's true right? 

00:39:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN I want you to introduce yourself. 

00:39:05
IMANUELLE Sorry. Ah, my name is Imanuelle(ph) from Texas. Sorry about it. For, for the... 

00:39:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY We don't mean to scare you, Imanuelle(ph). We're just gonna come up with a shock. 

00:39:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN You have mine. I got a really blooming one. Put it, please. 

00:39:20
IMANUELLE So, so my question is things do reach plateau, right? So, what do you do next when this sense of well-being reaches plateau? Ah, pa... 

00:39:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY When it reaches a, a plateau, the sense of well-being? 

00:39:35
IMANUELLE Thank you. 

00:39:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN What do you do when well-being reaches a plateau? 

00:39:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm, it's a good question. I think we should answer that more personally. You are-- are you talking about in therapy or you're talking about it personally? 

00:39:50
IMANUELLE For, for the clients and so with the therapy. 

00:39:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:39:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN I, I have an indirect answer to, - 

00:39:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. Go ahead. 

00:39:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN - to start us off. 

00:39:55
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:39:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN So, uhm, I taught a course with George Vaillant and Rick Summers, ah, few years ago called positive psychoanalysis. And, ah, they're actually-- amazingly, there is a positive psychiatry movement now - 

00:40:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:40:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - so the President Dilip has, ah, - 

00:40:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:40:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - his seminar with positive psychiatry. Uhm, so this was a course about termination and it came often as, "When do you stop therapy?" And I think the way we were taught about therapy termination, and I turned to you not a lot more, was when people are relatively conflict free. 

00:40:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:40:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN When you got the conflicts - 

00:40:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:40:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN - resolved and if, if you have a lot of time. But for my point of view, ah, having conflicts resolved that is having learned how to cope with sadness and not to be anxious and not to be angry brings you to zero. And people want well-being in their life as well. So, for me, termination would be a question of the building of PERMA as well as the reduction of conflict. And that's not the same as when - 

00:41:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:41:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN - PERMA reaches, ah, a plateau. 

00:41:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. I, I think part of what, what I would say about that if, if people reach a kind of plateau and if-- you know, I, I first of all ask them how happy are you? Would you like to be happier? And that-- that's a question. Would you like to be happier that you have to ask with a smile and with a real interest. 

00:41:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:41:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Because if you say, "Would you like to be happier?" you're gonna say, "No, I'm fine. I'm fine." But if you say, "Would you like to be happier?" Sometimes I, I say to clients things like, "Look, we're just imagining here what your life can be like. Let's shoot for the moon, you know? Let's imagine the best that we can imagine because why limit ourselves? You know, you may or you may not get it, but let's, let's imagine something." Because the one thing that I've discovered as a therapist is that people's lives could be much more positive that they ever imagined. And, and often, much more positive than we as therapists imagine. One of the difficulties that I found in doing work and training therapists is therapists get really nervous when clients set really high positive goals for themselves. Because as therapists, we've also been trained, oh, set therapy goals that are practical. Well, actually, we find sometimes, if you let clients set therapy goals that are impractical and widely, widely positive, clients are more motivated, they work harder and they achieve much more than we ever imagine that they could. 

00:42:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:42:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Thank you. Yeah. 

00:42:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN We'll, we'll do a couple in here and then go around there. 

00:42:45
LAUREN Uhm.. 

00:42:45
 Hmm, that side as well. 

00:42:50
LAUREN I'm, I'm Lauren(ph) and I'm from, ah, Barrow, Alaska at the moment, uhm, northern coast. 

00:42:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN Cold up there. 

00:42:55
LAUREN Yeah. Three hundred thirty miles below they are circles of, "Thank you for the sunshine." Yes. Uhm... 

00:43:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN Can, can you hear Lauren(ph)? 

00:43:00
 Stick your microphone please. 

00:43:00
LAUREN Uhm. 

00:43:00
 A little bit closer to you. 

00:43:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Take mine. 

00:43:05
LAUREN Thank you. Uhm, so, 20 years ago when I graduate-- when I was finished in graduate school, about five years after that I got pretty discourage about that the whole field is about, let's to figure out who to blame for what's - 

00:43:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hmm. 

00:43:20
LAUREN - going wrong in your life. And to start tracking with you and you know, and gra-- after graduate school was gu-- taking people from falling apart or functional. And what I really was interested in the seeking people from functional to fantastic. 

00:43:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:43:35
LAUREN And so, uhm, I just wanted to thank you for your pioneering in the field. And, uhm, and-- but right now it's we're on a healthcare-- well, in sick care really you know, ah, right, it's not, it's not about mental health like you said but it's really about mental sickness. 

00:43:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN Uh-hmm. 

00:43:55
LAUREN And how do we go from you know, impractical everyday life and practice? How do we get people not just from falling apart to functional but functional to fantastic when nobody wants to pay for it? 

00:44:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN Well, that's, ah, - 

00:44:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:44:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - uhm, ah, I'll comment and you probably have a good to say about that also. 

00:44:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Okay. Go ahead, Marti. 

00:44:15
MARTIN SELIGMAN Uhm, well, there are some techniques which are free, which we are - 

00:44:20
LAUREN Sure. 

00:44:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN - close to free, which we do anyway which-- how many of you are marital therapists or sex therapists? Ah, okay, well, I'm gonna offend you I'm afraid. Ah, and again, you know more about this and I do, but I have taught at some and have done it a bit. Ah, you probably the, the statistics for marital affair is the worst kind of therapy, that is the hardest form of therapy. The outcome statics are worst. People are lying to you. They are lying to each other. And, and when I thought this kind of thing, ah, and if you look at the manuals, what we're often to try to do is things like try to get people to fight more constructively. You know, I don't want people have the same damn fight every day in different guys. And in many ways, a lot of the techniques of marital therapy are the minus A to minus five techniques. So, I was thrilled when Shelly Gable and her colleagues, ah, started to work on Active Constructive Responding in marriage. So, the, the question here is, ah, what do you say to your spouse when she comes home from work with a victory? How do you celebrate it together? S o, it turns out there's a two by two table, active-passive, constructive-destructive. So, ah, ah, when I-- before the literature, what I did is I said, you know, "Congratulations. Mandy, you deserve it." That has zero effect. You might as-- yeah, to wallpaper. Ah, I work as some of you know with Drill Sergeants a lot. Drill Sergeants do active-destructive with their respect. You know what tax bracket that's gonna put us in? Ah, ah, passive-destructive is what's for dinner and the only thing that works which doesn't come naturally and is teachable is active-constructive. And that's, ah, ah-- you know, though I'd been reading the papers you wrote for, ah, the firm, ah, and that last paper you wrote on the pension plan was the best financial paper I've seen in my 25 years in business, now, ah, would you re-live the experience with me? You know, exactly what did your boss say to you and she tells you? And, exactly, where were you? And what do you think the real strengths you have that got you promoted are? And how can you use those strengths more at church with the kids? So, that's an example, I think of a simple technique that we get reimbursed for that's, uhm, are-- the evidences by the way that produces better sexuality, more love, lower divorce, higher commitment of-- a-- and, uh,-- so at least, that's, that's one example. Ah, Chris? 

00:47:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY I think you'd answered it well enough. I think we should get a few more - 

00:47:25
 Oh, yeah. 

00:47:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY - people and answer. I think that's good. 

00:47:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN Oh, I, I do wanna say one thing more Lauren(ph). Don't go away. 

00:47:30
LAUREN It's okay. 

00:47:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN The question of reimbursement is really a thorny one. 

00:47:40
LAUREN Yeah. Uhm, w-- it is in our blood to pay for the alleviation of misery, but somehow it doesn't seem to be the business of government or insurance companies to pay for the building of happiness. But all of us, you know-- I, I save money all year to take my kids on safari in Africa over Christmas. That's-- we'll willing to pay money to have better long lives. And it seems to me the-- that a-- if you will positive moves toward more PERMA in therapy is like taking your kids to Africa. Now, I don't know how to go from here to there, but I think we actually know ways to make people happier. And, ah, if we're effective at that and I think we are, ah, people should pay for it and pay for it. 

00:48:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 INNER CALIFORNIA NEVO2013 

00:48:35
CHRISTINE PADESKY And as we're walking over here, I encourage you that one way to help people pay for it more easily is to do this in groups. You don't have to do things individually. And, ah... 

00:48:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Could you-- can you, can you hear what Chris is saying? 

00:48:45
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. So, to do this in groups e-- because then it becomes more affordable to people and I agree. I think people will pay to have fantastic lives. 

00:48:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN In, in, in, in general, if you average over the entire outcome literature about groups versus individual therapy in general - 

00:49:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. 

00:49:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN - it looks to me that the outcomes are about - 

00:49:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY They're, they're very similar. Yeah. 

00:49:05
MARTIN SELIGMAN - same average over a very large literature. 

00:49:10
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. And none enough therapists do group therapy. Yeah. Yes. Hello. 

00:49:10
JACKIE Hi. Uhm, my name is Jackie(ph). I'm-- my name is Jackie(ph). I'm a graduate student and, ah, just finishing out. Uhm, sorry, I'm so excited to see you guys. It's hard to kind of control. 

00:49:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY I know. 

00:49:25
JACKIE And so, uhm, I was really interested when you started to talking about cultivating genius and cultivating positive institutions. Cuz it's really seems to imply that our client-based is gonna start to expand from just people with disorders to sort cultivating people on the other side of the spectrum. And I'm just wondering that you know, I've got a long time in this career. Moving forward, how you guys see that working for us as therapists? 

00:49:45
MARTIN SELIGMAN Uhm-- could you hear the question? Uhm, so, let me - 

00:49:55
JACKIE Yeah, sure. 

00:49:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN - do this. So, I'm not gonna do in the therapeutic contacts, but I tell you what I-- where I am these days and what I'm most excited about. Ah, so, I just got $5.5 million from the Templeton Foundation to work on imagination and creativity. Uhm, let me tell you the background of it and then what we're gonna do. And I don't know if I can say how it affects therapy but it's what I'm doing these days. So, uhm, belong that ground here is when I started to think about the omission of the positive in traditional psychology and clinical psychology. Ah, it seemed to me after a while, there was an even deeper omission and that was positive things by enlarging future. The bad thing is that if it happened to you or by in large in the past. You can't get away with a theoretical model in psychology in which you talk about the past and the present. But when you start to talk about the positive that people believe that things they want, you have to think about people's planning for the future. So, I wrote an article about a year ago with, ah, some really brilliant colleagues, Roy Baumeister, Chandra Sripada and Peter Railton about prospection in which we basically argued that we're not Homo Sapiens, we're homoperspectives. That what you're doing right now as I'm talking for nonlogically is you're not in your past. You're running mental simulations of what you can do in the future with what I'm saying. That is the normal form of mentation. Ah, at least 40% of mentation it turns out to be is in the future. So, we started to think about the question, could you make people better prospectors of the future? Could you make them better at mental simulations of what might happen and how to evaluate them. Ah, once you start thinking about prospection, then you start thinking about imagination and creativity. So, ah, for some of you that maybe interested in this, there are, there are requests for proposals we put out so that the deadline for the letter intent-- I hope you submit - 

00:52:10
JACKIE Hmm. 

00:52:10
MARTIN SELIGMAN - is January 1st. Ah, for people who, ah, the measurement of prospection, the mechanism of prospection, ah, the application of prospection and most important for therapy, ho-- how do you improve prospection? So, that's part one. But then the second part came along which was very much-- so we're gonna give, ah, $15,200 grants for people to do that. Ah, then, ah, Jack Templeton said, ah, he really like to be able to increase people's imagination. So, ah, next September we'll do a similar, ah, request for proposals. If you think you got a way to measure imagination, ah, intervention for teaching imagination and a group and a controlled group for measuring it's outcome. Now, what I'm really excited about though is something that were coined-- you know, I've read the literature on imagination and creativity. Ah, I'll probably gonna offense some people here. I think it's largely a non-starter. As best as I can see, no one has ever systematically made people consistently more creative or imaginative. So, we're gonna start again. So, I'm gonna conduct 12 genius weekends in which in 12 different disciplines, we bring together the four most imaginative people in the world. 

00:53:35
JACKIE Uh-hmm. 

00:53:35
MARTIN SELIGMAN And we asked them how they do it-- ah, what their wackiest ideas are. The foundation will be there to fund their wackiest ideas, ah, and how, how, how to improve it. The 12 disciplines are-- will be mathematics, cosmology, ah, psychology, film, novel, music, ah, the corporation, technology, ah, museums and there are couple of more. So, ah, for-- my future is very tied up into what you're in-- interested and as how to-- how in everyday life can we produce more imagination and even better, how we can produce more, more genuis. 

00:54:20
JACKIE Thank you. 

00:54:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Thank you. And pertinent to Marti's comment, just think about this. He's a psychologist - 

00:54:25
JACKIE Yeah. 

00:54:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY - and listen to what he's doing. And do you think he's impacting people's lives in a positive way? So, I think also as therapists, we need to re-imagine our role in what we do. I try to get therapists to re-imagine therapy even if it's in small ways like do know we sit your chair across from the person when you're doing therapy. Get up. Walk around. Look at things. You know, have experiences together as, as father for discussion relevant to whatever the clients there to talk to about. And, similarly, we don't have to do all our interventions that interest us in psychotherapy sitting in an office. We can get out into the public. We can do public lectures. We can, you know, set up things in our neighborhoods, in our communities. There's a lot of things that we can do. We can go to the post office and smile. So, there's a lot of things that we can do to put these ideas into a fact. And we will learn ourselves from doing these ideas in as many creative ways as we imagine. 

00:55:25
JACKIE Thank you. 

00:55:25
CHRISTINE PADESKY Thank you. 

00:55:30
DAVID SINCLAIR Hi. David, David Sinclair, ah, from Canada. And just in the past few years, we've had the fortune-- good fortune - 

00:55:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Hi, David. Good to see you again. 

00:55:40
DAVID SINCLAIR - to have both of you, ah, come and speak at our Feldman Lecture at the Grey Nuns Hospital. 

00:55:40
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:45
DAVID SINCLAIR My, my question is gonna be really mundane after all of these wonderful stuff. But when you talked earlier, you mentioned that, uhm, smiling and, and, and being, uhm, ah-- I guess humors, e-- talking about some of these catastrophic thoughts would not be appropriate. 

00:56:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yes. 

00:56:05
DAVID SINCLAIR It will be helpful. 

00:56:05
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:56:10
DAVID SINCLAIR So, I guess where I'm going is my concern because I'm really highly invested in using, uhm, humor in psychotherapy because we all know that people learn better - 

00:56:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Sure. 

00:56:20
DAVID SINCLAIR - when, when - 

00:56:20
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:56:20
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:56:20
DAVID SINCLAIR - when, when the message is delivered humorously or in a context. Maybe it's counterproductive. 

00:56:30
CHRISTINE PADESKY Le-- let me, let me a, a simple principle or guideline you can use, David, and everyone else as well. If you're helping, if you're trying to be emphatic and understand where someone is, and you're-- they're talking to you about something painful or difficult or whatever, ah, at that time, you wanna have a co-- you know, an interested, concern, compassionate - 

00:56:50
DAVID SINCLAIR Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

00:56:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY - look on your face. When you-- when it's appropriate and you think the time is right and you begin to switch to, now how would you like things to be different, what would you-- how would you like things to be - 

00:57:00
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah. 

00:57:00
CHRISTINE PADESKY - then you see a smile naturally comes on my face. So, when you start moving to the constructive, then a smile comes on. And then if the person says, "Well, I would really like this but oh, I'll never have that sort of thing in my life," then you have a therapeutic choice. As a therapist you can say, "Oh, so you feel discouraged, you'll never have that in your life. Or you can say, "Oh, I know it seems impossible but wouldn't it be something?" So that's how I would describe the, the interplay between compassionate, empathy and smiling and possibility. 

00:57:40
DAVID SINCLAIR Thank you. 

00:57:40
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. Thank you, David for the question. 

00:57:40
 Yeah. 

00:57:40
 We have, ah, one more question. 

00:57:45
TANIA It will be quick. Uhm, hi. This is Naville(ph) and I'm Tania(ph) and I'm from Mexico. 

00:57:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:57:50
TANIA Sorry. When I get nervous my - 

00:57:50
MARTIN SELIGMAN Can, can you hear it? 

00:57:50
TANIA - English gets really bad. 

00:57:50
CHRISTINE PADESKY Yeah. 

00:57:55
TANIA Uhm, so... 

00:57:55
MARTIN SELIGMAN I'm sorry. 

00:57:55
TANIA Ah, you talked about-- well, all for - 

00:58:00
 Yeah. 

00:58:00
TANIA - promotion of health and happiness, but sometimes when, when we emphasize the positive emotions people feel that then we have to avoid the negative emotions. Like you said, we learn better when we are in a positive state of mind and positive emotions, but sometimes being sad or being angry is helpful and necessary as well. So, how can you combine this emphasis on the positive without turning the negative into an enemy or something that needs to be avoided? 

00:58:30
MARTIN SELIGMAN Yeah, positive psychology is not advocate-- not dealing with negative. I've spent-- no, first three or five years of my life dealing with trauma and helplessness and depression. It's a submental to what we do. I mean, ah, I don't think the negative really needs advocates. It's there. Ah, but because of what I said about the tongue and being bad weather animals. What it really does need learning about-- what I've had to learn about in life was the positive and how to have more of it. So, I'm suggesting there's another arrow that we can add to our quiver as therapist, and that is to building of well-being in addition to the alleviation of misery. 

00:59:15
CHRISTINE PADESKY Uh-hmm. And if you think about doing an intake or someone who's in a lot of pain and difficulty, I think a nice way to do it is-- you know, of course, if they're coming to you and they're in a lot of pain and difficulty, you wanna hear that story and be emphatic and serious about witnessing and really hearing their story. But a nice thing to do then is before they leave that first appointment is to say to them, "I really appreciate you telling me about these struggles and it would-- you know, I'd like to know a little bit more about other areas of your life. Are there areas of your life right now where things are going a bit better for you?" And again, you see my smile starts to come up to communicate. This is safe to talk about as well cuz I'd like to know-- get the whole complete picture of your life. Because many times, clients also-- they have been socialized that therapy is just talking about problems, so you need to signal to them very assertively that it is also okay to talk about positive things in your life as well. 

01:00:20
 Thank you.
