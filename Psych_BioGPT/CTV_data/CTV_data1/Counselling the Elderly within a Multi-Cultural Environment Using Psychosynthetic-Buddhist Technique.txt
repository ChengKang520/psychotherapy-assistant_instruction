JEFFREY PO It's me here, Jeffrey Po, nonpartisan brown color, black eyes, white hair, and no hair, that's me. 

00:00:10
 Absolute disguise. 

00:00:15
JEFFREY PO Disguise, yeah. I'm supposed to do the -- this presentation tomorrow, but then, yesterday morning, Philip caught me and says, Jeffy, could you mind swapping with a guy who's missed his plane. I said, okay. Alright then, then, we swapped. So, anyway he assured me that you're all informed and so, here we are, okay. My apologies for those who have got -- who don't have my notes because before I came, I wrote in to the organizer, to ask the organizer, you know, how many participants are -- will be coming to this workshop and he said -- they said 20. So, okay. I printed 25 notes, with extra five and I was surprised that there is more of you here then, yeah? So, I'm sorry. I think -- but those who want the PowerPoint presentation, after the workshop, you could leave your email, address or whatever address you have, and I'll make sure that, you know, you get the notes, alright? Okay, now I've to be up there, in which I don't quite like to be, up here, because you know, when I lecture, I prefer to be down with the group and all that. I mean, here, it makes me a sort of an -- an actor. So, not ah -- I prefer to be me. Okay, anyway, welcome again. And my name is Jeffrey. I'm from Singapore. And my workshop today is counseling the elderly within a multicultural environment using psychosynthetic-Buddhist technique, quite a mouthful, but I think each one has got some meaning there. The Psychosynthetic-Buddhist technique is something which I personally developed over the last year or so because I deal a lot with elderlies in Singapore. And I deal with them in a home -- not in a home settings, but rather in institutional settings. And as I go along, I'll explain, you know, how is it done in Singapore. And you'll find that some of this -- that the old folks that I deal with, they are really in a -- I don't know, I used the word, you know, commerce pathetic stage because many of them are immigrants that came from China, from India, from Indonesia, 80 years ago, 70 years ago thinking that Singapore is a land of milk and honey. You know, they came to -- hoping to set a business, hoping to do many things. Many of them came without any family hoping to start families in Singapore. And after 80 years, 85 years, 70 years, many of them were quite disappointed. And today, many of them are in old-folks home and you know, the sadness that they're feeling there is not a very good feeling, and I deal with them because for one thing, death is approaching, and I think they should, you know, at least come to terms with themselves to be able to meet the situation when the time comes then, alright? Okay, shall we start now?

00:04:05
JEFFREY PO Okay, this presentation, the parameters is within Singapore setting. The research was done in Singapore and I counsel in Singapore. It's within Singapore multicultural, multiracial and multireligious mix. I think as you know, Singapore is very multiracial, multicultural and multireligious. You could -- it's quite normal to find a temple in one side, a mosque opposite the road, and a church somewhere, you know, just walking distance away again. It's beautiful because I think in that sense, we get a sort of an interaction within the various religion and within the various cultures. I mean, if -- if I tell you what my mom did -- usually do, I think you'll probably get a shock or something. During the first day of Chinese New Year, it is traditional that we visit a temple, pay respects to our, you know, forefathers and so forth. And, after that, we'll go to Roman Catholic Church to give thanks and to say,'hi, Jesus Christ, thank you so much for the last one year, and please look after us for the next one year', and after that, then we'll pop in into a Hindu temple and you know, go along with the fire ceremony. The only thing that we don't do is to go to a mosque because they're not open and you know, and there are some restrictions. So, we're not familiar with the procedures there. But, excuse me. But, other than that I think the three others , the Buddhist temple, Taoist Temple; the church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Hindu temple, I mean, we're quite familiar with what was going on there. So, there you are, in there, Singapore. I deal a lot with elderly for the last two or three years. Before that I was doing a lot of marriage counseling, counseling for adolescence, you know, students of -- with high risk. But I find that normally, that elderly are much better lot because they don't question so much. So, when you tell them, I say, 'sir, breathe'. I mean, he breathe. When you tell a young -- a teenager, I say, 'okay breathe', 'What for?'. So, I mean, so -- and okay. And it is within institutional environment, I explained just now. And the method is a psychosynthetic-Buddhist therapeutic technique. It is a secular approach, alright. 

00:07:00
The Singapore setting 

00:07:00
One of the fastest growing ageing population 

00:07:00
Problems in intergenerational living concept 

00:07:00
Singapore government's effort 

00:07:00
- Three tier family 

00:07:00
- Homes for immobile 

00:07:00
- Homes for those mobile 

00:07:00
- Day care centres 

00:07:00
- Senior Citizen Activities centre 

00:07:00
JEFFREY PO Now, there are several features in Singapore. Some of you are familiar. It's one of the fastest growing ageing population. And, now we know about this, I think, about 20 years ago. Twenty, 25 years ago, the government has already warned us that in time, Singapore is gonna have a sort of a inverted pyramid sort of a structure, you know. And it's true, it's coming that, we all know. But the problem is that within those 20 years, they didn't do very much, but now they panic because our senior ministers are getting old, our minister mentor is getting older, our whatever ministers are getting old also. So, they've just pressed the red button and it's now the ministers' sons who's got to look after the minister father. Now, so their problems are intergenerational living concept, in a sense that, because of a lot of, you know, today's youth, they're very well-informed. They go to the Internet, they -- they surf the Internet and so forth. And what they find is that they want only for their own, alright. And even, you know, my son, when he was 18, he tells me that, 'okay dad, you better get prepared'. I said, prepared for what?. I'm gonna move out. I said, when you're gonna move out? When I get married. I said, when you're getting married? When I find a girlfriend. When you're gonna find a girlfriend? Can you find one for me? I said, no, you find your own girlfriend, I'm not gonna find a girlfriend for you. So, okay -- I mean, we know and he's moved out and I think as you all know that if you do counseling, you know that it is that emptiness syndrome that comes in, but of course we were prepared for that emptiness syndrome. I didn't replace the emptiness syndrome with a dog, or a cat or a cockroach, so on. You know, it's okay, we accepted that. So, the government is trying very hard to maintain the three-tier family, but it doesn't always look that way. And so, we built homes for those immobile. And especially we've got a number of homes that is -- cater especially for stroke patients, and they go there for certain activities, for certain rehabilitation activities and all that. We've got homes for those who are mobile, who are okay, but going along with walking sticks and some walking aids. We've got day care centres where -- about 15 years ago, we developed day care centres for children because the working mothers and working parents have got to dump their children somewhere. Today, we have day centres for the old folks and -- because the working parents will not only dump their children in day care centre, they will dump the old folks in the day care centre also, alright. And we've got Senior Citizens Activity centre where they come down for a day to some activity and they go back at night. 

00:10:20
Ethnic, cultural, religious mix 

00:10:20
Big Headache!!! 

00:10:20
Ethnicity - immigrants from Malaysia, 

00:10:20
Indonesia, India, China, Middle 

00:10:20
east, Pakistan, Sri Lanka 

00:10:20
Cultural - a melting pot 

00:10:20
Religion - Buddhist, Taoists, Muslims, 

00:10:20
Hindus, Christians, Parsees, Jains 

00:10:20
Folk beliefs - mediums and bomohs 

00:10:20
JEFFREY PO So, in terms of ethnic, cultural and religious mix, at Singapore, we've got a big headache. And I think as counselors, I've got a greater headache because as I said, we've got many immigrants come from Malaysia, Indonesia, India, China, Middle-east, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and whatever, but they're all from Earth. So, no problem. Okay, even from Malaysia, you'd be surprised that those from South Malaysia, from Johor, their cultural practice is slightly different from those from North Malaysia, from Terengganu Klang area, alright? And when -- from Indonesia, we've got Minangkabaus we've got Bataks, we've got those from Bangka Island those from Sulawesi, those from Manado and so forth. So -- And each has got their own different variation of culture. India, mainly the South Indians from, the southern part of India, from the Malabar, and all that, but we do get a lot -- many Indians coming from the north. And that is why when you get down to Singapore, and when you get down to the Little India, don't just order Indian food. You got to specify you want North Indian food or South Indian food, alright? The North Indian food are more of the Pakistani type of, you know, the tandooris and all that, but the South Indian is more spicy; Sri Lanka and so forth. So, it's a cultural melting pot. So, being a cultural melting pot, sometimes when we do counseling, you know, our head is got to be a melting pot also. Fortunately, we don't melt down. In religion, we got Buddhist, Taoism, Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Parsees, Jains. I don't know whether you have Jainism or not, Jains. They are special sect of Hinduism, alright. Parsees are from Persia. They have the tradition from Zoroastrianism alright? And there are many Parsees that are from Persia, they went into Pakistan, into North India, and then they came down to Singapore. Christians, fair enough. Also, we've got Roman Catholics, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Bethesda, whatever it is, whole lot of them, okay. And then, you've got one interesting group, are the folk belief, the mediums, the bomohs; they believe in genes and spirits and where you can, you know, call a spirit, put them in a bottle and you know, when you uncork them, the spirit will come up and all that. And it became a very interesting in terms of counseling, in the sense that, I attended a workshop that was organized by the Association for Muslim Professionals in Singapore. And there they come with this question, they say, there are many Muslims there who still believe in this, you know, folk belief, and in mediums and bomohs and genes and all that, and you know, what do you do with them then? I mean, you can't -- it's difficult, I mean to apply Freud's psychoanalytical theory. It's difficult to, you know, use a western style, sometimes. And finally after the workshop, they all agreed that work with the belief of that guy then, if the guy believes that a check can fly,(ph) fair enough then the check can fly,(ph) and just try to treat him then, forget about the whys behind it, that's not what you know, hurt the guy who says,(ph) forget about the wise, just go on, and move on. 

00:14:20
The elderly - senior citizens 

00:14:20
Big problem!!! 

00:14:20
Ministry of Community Youth and Sports - 50 

00:14:20
Retirement age 55...60...62 

00:14:20
Withdrawal of Central Provident Funds - 55 

00:14:20
Ministry of Transport - 62 

00:14:20
Counsellors psychologists, psychotherapist, psychiatrists, 

00:14:20
social workers, physicians, medical doctors, TCM... 

00:14:20
Big confusion!!! 

00:14:20
JEFFREY PO Now, and there is a greater problem in Singapore when it becomes to define what is old aging. For the Ministry of Community Development and Sports, when you're 50, you're considered as the aged. I'm 65. So, I'm no longer in the aged group, I'm in the ancient group, alright? And when you get to the 80s, you become the antique group. And when you go into the 90s, then you become a museum piece. Anyway, they did define the elderly as 50 and above. But, in the retirement age, that's why we retire from work, government says 55. Now, they've increased to 60, and now they've increased to 62. So, but -- withdrawal of Central Provident Fund is 55, you're considered as old, and the Ministry of Transport, before we get, what we known as an easy link, bus cut and all that, they say 62 then, then you're old. So, even in Singapore, I mean, when we become to the elderly, we are not that quite sure of, you know, trying to find out what is elderly. So, some counselors, psychologists, psychotherapist, psychiatrists, social workers, physicians, medical doctors and TCM, these are the traditional medical practitioners with herbs and all that; very big confusion!

00:15:45
Mainly Public Assistance recipients 

00:15:45
Exhibited symptoms of mild depression, social isolation, 

00:15:45
dysfunctional family relations, abandoned, destitute, etc. 

00:15:45
JEFFREY PO Now, okay, what initiated me to do -- get into this, the elderly people and all that, and to use a psychosynthetic Buddhist therapy onto them. 

00:16:00
Thong Kheng Senior Citizen Activity Centre 

00:16:00
2009 - Resident counselor 

00:16:00
500 seniors - one room flat 

00:16:00
Chinese - early immigrants 

00:16:00
Mainly mandarin and dialect speaking 

00:16:00
Mainly Public Assistance recipients 

00:16:00
Exhibited symptoms of mild depression, social isolation, 

00:16:00
dysfunctional family relations, abandoned, destitute, etc. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY PO When we started about a year-and-a-half, two years ago, when I was engaged as a sort of a consultant and counselor to a senior citizen home, that is called the Thong Kheng Senior Citizen Activity Centre, they've got about, it was in 2009. I was a Resident Counselor there. They've got about 500 seniors who are staying in one room flat, okay. And these are the Chinese, early Chinese immigrants, mainly mandarin speaking and dialect speaking. And that is also a problem because when it comes -- when you ask them things like, you know, words like worry and anxiety, it's difficult to translate down into dialects, alright? So, sometimes if -- for them, worry and anxiety means the same thing, alright? And they don't know the difference. And sometimes when you ask them, you know, in the last few days, are you worried around? Yeah, of course I'm worried. Why you're worried? Oh, because I bought a lottery and the number did not come in then, that's why I was worried. You know, sometime they give that sort of reason. Now, and they are mainly on Public Assistance recipients, that means, they get a sort of a monthly allowance from the government. And they exhibited symptoms of mild depression, social isolation, dysfunctional family relations and abandoned and they are destitute; these people there. 

00:17:30
The Initiator - 2 

00:17:30
Issues over impending death event 

00:17:30
Not overtly concern about life after death issues 

00:17:30
Explore their emotional expressions over concept 

00:17:30
of "Hell regions" 

00:17:30
Many not concerned over issues of life after death 

00:17:30
Many concerned over death rituals and "sending 

00:17:30
off" Photographs 

00:17:30
JEFFREY PO And I found that the main complaint was there's this number of old folks who were depressed. And after talking to them, I found that, you know, they were -- in fact they were more -- the issues over impending death events. They're not so much concerned about death, but they're more concerned about the -- what's going to happen, the rituals that's going to happens when they die because these old folks have got nobody to look after them. So, when you talk to them about life after death, they say, why worry? When I die, my eyes close, that's all. But then, when my eyes close, what's going to happen to my body then? So, you know, in Taoism, there is this hell regions and all that, and they're bit afraid of going down to the various hell regions. But, you'll find that they're -- all of them are concerned, you know, with one thing, a photograph of themselves. That's what they want, because during the funeral rights, usually in front of the casket, you'll put a photograph of the deceased person, and they got no money to buy the photograph, and nobody has come to take photograph for them, okay. So, I had to arrange with the centre to get this thing done, and to assure them that when you die, I mean, if you are a Taoist, okay, we'll get a monk or priest to come, if you're a Christian, we'll get a priest to come in and do some sort of rituals. After that, no more depression. Okay, they were all happy. We -- so, the photograph cost $5, the frame cost another $2. So, for $7, they're quite happy now, alright. And, you know, if these people were to be diagnosed by a psychologist or a psychiatrist, they'd be probably be given medication, alright? So, that is -- I think the importance of the counselor at that time where you step into to find out what is actually, you know, bothering them.

Senior citizen exercise activity 

00:19:50
JEFFREY PO  You find some of the senior citizens there doing the exercises. 

00:20:00
Difficulties 

00:20:00
Language translations 

00:20:00
Meanings 

00:20:00
Symbols - images 

00:20:00
JEFFREY PO Now, like I said just now, the difficulty in talking to these dialect people is that, there is language translation, meanings and symbols and images, where sometimes they will -- for instance a cross, say again. 

00:20:20
 (inaudible ). 

00:20:25
JEFFREY PO Oh, the symbols, yeah. To a Christian, a cross would mean a different thing than for a Taoist, alright? So, you've got to be careful when you talk to these people and you got to find out sometime that their religious affiliation are their religious background, a little bit, yeah.

00:21:15
JEFFREY PO Ah...again, another scene. So, 500 elderly residents living in one room apartments again. And, you know, one room apartment serves as everything, that is the kitchen, the hall, the sleeping area, is all in that one room there. They've got toilet facilities. Again, mainly mandarin speaking, financial issues and, many of them have got unpaid rentals to the government. So, they owe the government money.

00:22:50
Survey - 1 

00:22:50
Aim of survey - personal 

00:22:50
Questionnaires - designed towards 

00:22:50
topic on death (not dying) 

00:22:50
To gauge respondents feelings 

00:22:50
General result 

00:22:50
JEFFREY PO Now, so with those homes, I was fortunate enough to conduct a sort of a survey, to ask them about, and of life issues. 

00:23:05
Survey - 2 

00:23:05
(contd): 

00:23:05
Considerations 

00:23:05
-Not a formal research 

00:23:05
-No literature review 

00:23:05
-No discussions 

00:23:05
JEFFREY PO And I've got some of the results there, okay. But, it's just a general survey and is not a very specific survey, with no control group and so forth. We'll go through the survey results later on. So, it is not a formal research. There is no literature review and no discussions. And, no, it's not a formal sort of presentation. 

00:23:30
Survey - 3 

00:23:30
Findings of survey: 

00:23:30
Survey Analysis - General 

00:23:30
JEFFREY PO Now, the interesting thing is that I found was, when the question was asked, the statement, I'm aware of my death is approaching. A lot majority admitted that they are aware. But, many of them don't think about it, alright? But then, about 50% of the respondents want to know something about it. So, what I found in that, and then, you know, that death education is lacking in Singapore. Many say that life is meaningful, but if you were to -- and you are not sure there, you find about 50-50 that life for them in the past has not been meaningful. Again, about 60-40% say that they've not been happy with their life. And, about 50-50 believe that there is something else after death. Another 50% believe that, you know, end of life means end of life. Lonely, if you add that, again 50-50, they've been lonely there. But, again surprisingly, not many are afraid of their death there. Okay now, coming back to the -- the subject proper. 

00:25:10
Why Psychosynthetic Buddhist approach? 

00:25:10
A synthesis of Assagioli's psychosynthesis therapy 

00:25:10
Buddhist psychotherapy 

00:25:10
JEFFREY PO What is Psychosynthetic Buddhist approach? Actually, it is a synthesis of Assagioli's psychosynthesis therapy and Buddhist psychotherapy. 

00:25:15
Psychosynthesis - 1 

00:25:15
-Attempts to unify and harmonize various 

00:25:15
components of the unconscious, such as 

00:25:15
dreams, fantasies and instinctual drives with 

00:25:15
the rest of personality. 

00:25:15
-Principle advocated by Carl Jung 

00:25:15
-Seen as constructive approach as opposed to 

00:25:15
Sigmund Freud's reductive approach 

00:25:15
-Ray Corsini 

00:25:15
(The Dictionary of Psychology) 

00:25:15
JEFFREY PO  Now, so, this technique is an attempt to unify and harmonize various components of the unconscious states, such as dream, fantasies and instinctual drives with the rest of personality. The principle was first advocated by Jung. I think you all might have certainly known Carl Jung. And it is seen as a constructive approach as opposes to Sigmund Freud's reductive approach. I think -- okay, we have got to acknowledge Freud as the father of psychoanalysis, trying to -- getting involved with mental health, mental disease and all that. But today, I think Freud is not being used very much because it is tedious, too long. And, if you ask the old folks about their dreams, and you get all sorts of, you know, stories coming from them. And they will get a problem with their dreaming application. An Indian dreaming of banana might mean different from a Chinese dreaming of banana, okay? So, it becomes bit difficult. So, -- and I think that's one of the weakness of Freud's, what do you call that, theory and, as a therapy, okay.

Psychosynthesis - 2 

00:26:40
-As psychotherapy - a system built upon The 

00:26:40
foundation of psychoanalysis 

00:26:40
-However, it is further than psychoanalysis 

00:26:40
and tries to finish what psychoanalysis 

00:26:40
started 

00:26:40
-One essential aspect is its philosophical 

00:26:40
emphasis on values 

00:26:40
-Roberto Assagioli 

00:26:40
JEFFREY PO Now, -- so, psychotherapy is a system built upon foundation of psychoanalysis. However, it is further -- try to start -- now, psychosynthesis, now -- so, Roberto Assagioli, he was in fact a student of Freud, and he was very keen on what Freud has done, and in fact what happened was that, he started psychoanalytical or psychoanalysis in Italy. Now, Jung and Freud was so elegant, they're so happy that they said, at last we've got somebody in Italy to do something, you know, on this therapeuting. But, surprisingly our good friend Roberto Assagioli, when he was doing his Ph.D., he decided and he said that now, Freud's has got a lot of limitation, because for one thing he mentioned that, Freud looks at the person's past, but Freud doesn't look at the person's future, which to him is very important also because the future do influence a person's current condition. And he also said that, you know, there is a spiritual power of the person then, the transpersonal part of the person, which one would have to consider, whereas Freud is very structured. Now, in about that time to, Jung came in with his concept of the unconscious, and Assagioli co-operated very well, collaborated very well with Jung and he developed what is known as the egg diagram, alright, to say that as human, we've got the lower unconscious, the middle unconscious, and the higher unconscious, and that all these, you know, if they can connect it, there is a well-being of the person then. And he gives a several systems, several techniques of how to connect this, this various unconscious, alright?

Psychosynthesis - 3 

00:28:45
-It has close ties to the theories of Alfred 

00:28:45
Adler and to Freudian revisionist such as 

00:28:45
Karen Honey 

00:28:45
-It consists elements of existentialism and 

00:28:45
humanism. 

00:28:45
JEFFREY PO Now, psychosynthesis has got a close ties to the theories of Alfred Adler and to Freudian revisionist such as Karen Honey. It contains elements of existentialism and humanism. So, (inaudible ) modern sense. 

00:29:00
Buddhist psychotherapy - 1 

00:29:00
-Employment of the fourfold mindfulness 

00:29:00
(sati) of the body (kaya), sensation 

00:29:00
(vedana), the mind (citta) and phenomena 

00:29:00
(dhamma). 

00:29:00
-Akin to psychoanalysis 

00:29:00
-But it goes one step further 

00:29:00
-It proceeds to a higher synthesis or 

00:29:00
intensification of consciousness through the 

00:29:00
process of concentration (samadhi). 

00:29:00
-Lama Anagarika Govinda 

00:29:00
JEFFREY PO Now, coming to Buddhist psychotherapy, now -- it was only quite recent, about 100 years ago that people began to realize that Buddhism is actually not philosophical based, but rather it is psychological based. And if you read very closely the texts of what the Buddha has been taught or his discussions, you'll find that it deals a lot with the consciousness, with the mind, and we've personality, we've identity and so forth then, alright. The only problem was that all these causes had not been translated until quite recently by the British Epileptic Society. And so, the world at large is not aware of the existence of these documents. 

00:30:00
The common ground - 1 

00:30:00
Both recognizes the significance of the "higher self" 

00:30:00
and the importance of engaging the person's "will" 

00:30:00
Assagioli sees the will as performing the following 

00:30:00
important function: 

00:30:00
-Goal, evaluation, motivation 

00:30:00
-Deliberation 

00:30:00
-Decision 

00:30:00
-Affirmation 

00:30:00
-Planning 

00:30:00
-Direction of the execution 

00:30:00
JEFFREY PO Buddhism actually has got three groups of teaching. One is the discussions of Buddha. One -- next one is the rules and regulations of the -- that governs the members of the order. And the third one is -- which is called abhidhamma, translate that is higher dhamma and some people translate it as Buddhist psychology. Now, not many people have studied Buddhist psychology, I mean, even Buddhists, because it is very dry, very tedious subject. And they're not interested. And because in that topic, they discuss about the mind, consciousness, about the -- they discuss about things, tension, will, mindfulness, awareness, and all other moral values that has been discussed on here. So -- but the important things is fore foundation of mindfulness known as the Satipatthana Sutta and here I've taken that part out to use it as a treatment for as a therapy for these old people, for these old folks there. Now, you'll find that -- oops, actually all this is meditation techniques, all right. Now, but to the old folks, I mean, to the elderly when I meet them, you can't tell them, okay, could you please your eyes and meditate? First thing they come back to me and say, why do you want me to close my eyes? What are you going to do to me? I said, no, you know, can you just please close your eyes then. Now, so it's not easy, because they're suspicious and that's why dealing with the old people, with the old folks, I've got to start with, you know what Rogers like Rogers, you know, building empathy, building trust, building honesty and whatever, whatever until a time comes when you say, close your eyes, they will, you know, very quietly just close their eyes. Now, so but you all might ask, what is this got to do with you know, meditation and how is it going to affect the elderly? We'll go through later on -- in later slides, I'll explain to you. So it is keen to psychoanalysis because there is this part here where you become mindful of phenomena, the dhamma, this is slightly a psychoanalytical now, because that old folk or that elderly person would have gotten flanked upon meaning of lives, importance of their life and things like asking existential questions, they've come with the say obvious, so much hopes, so much faith and things went wrong. What is the meaning of this thing that went wrong, or what is the meaning that now they're landed themselves in an old age home with nobody. All right. Uh, and so it pushes the higher synthesis or intensification of consciousness through the process of concentration, so you'll find that in all these, in the mind, you get concentration, and from there you go where they will look into their own lives. Because many of these old people, they've been working and working and working as laborers in the valves, in the docks and all that where they've got no time to think about themselves. Alright. And then what I found is that when -- in the end, when they are put into the old age home, there is certain anger in them, there is certain sense of frustration, certain sense of unfulfilment of certain desires, certain wish, certain dreams. When they came from China, 19, 20 years old, they were full of all hopes and dreams at Singapore, one baby, a paradise and all that, but some or other after 70, 80 years, their dreams was not fulfilled and so they have this sense of loss -- sense of loss of one life. 

00:34:45
The common ground - 2 

00:34:45
Psychosynthesis connects the conscious self (the 

00:34:45
"I") to the Higher Self 

00:34:45
Buddhist psychotherapy integrates the mental 

00:34:45
(nama) and physical (rupa) into a single entity. 

00:34:45
JEFFREY PO  Now, the similarity between psychosynthesis and the Buddhist psychotherapy is that, both recognizes the significance of the higher self and the importance of engaging the person's will. Each of us has got this aspect of our self, which is known as the will, it's a functional aspect and it's not will power, but it is the will that drives us to do what we want to drive -- what we want to do and behind will, there is motivation, there is enthusiasm, keenness and that sort of thing. Uh, so again, when dealing with the old people, obviously the elderly people, I try to get them to be enthusiastic again, I try to get them to have that zest of life, although -- I know sometimes it may not -- it's not successful, but to put in that zest again for them to just to live a more enriching life for the years that they have. Now, so in -- according to Assagioli, will will consist of this thing, how you have a goal, you evaluate, you motivate, but then when it comes to actual counseling, I don't sit down to put all these into paper and go through step by step with the elderly people. So -- but when I do it, this is at the back of my mind.

00:36:20
Meditative techniques: 

00:36:20
Psychosynthetic approach 

00:36:20
Buddhist approach 

00:36:20
JEFFREY PO  Now, psychosynthesis connects the consciousness self, the "I" to the Higher Self, that is aim of Assagioli. In Buddhist psychotherapy, one integrates the mental nama and physical self into single entity. So both system are holistic, alright. Now, today, we learn -- we hear a lot about the mind method relationship and through these relationship, if you want to connect them, you got to use a process, which is called mindfulness and awareness of the self and so forth, awareness of the body. 

00:37:00
Technique used - 1 

00:37:00
Commences with relaxation exercises to 

00:37:00
ensure physical and mental calmness 

00:37:00
JEFFREY PO  Now, and both uses meditative techniques for treatment. Surprisingly, when I read Assagioli, I found that in his book, there are many western psychotherapist at that time, people like Schulz, Happich, they used visualization, they used meditative techniques also as a method of therapy, but they were dealing more with this institutionalized mental patients whereas in my case, we're not using -- I'm not dealing with mental patients, but just the senior citizens, the old people.

Kretschmer (1951) 

00:37:45
JEFFREY PO  Now, so what we normally do? Okay. Now, when I meet the client, the old folk, usually I will tell the people in the center , in the home, the managers that, not to introduce me as a counselor because when they hear the word counselor, the first thing that come to their mind is, you know, (inaudible ) that means, government people, alright. So counselor means, government people, government people means, shut up, shut up means, don't say anything, you know, alright. Government people means, I want some more money, government people means, complain, food not nice and you know that sort of thing. So I say, don't say I'm a counselor, just say, I'm a friend that has come to talk to you and to see you know, whatever issues you have and we just get them from their end, okay and that's what we do. Alright. So we -- I'll start with the relationship building first, you know, the trust. And you know, to these old people, the -- in Singapore, the mind is, the mentality is food, food. So to these more folks, after you get to know them and all that and I just ask, what would you like to eat? I know the -- I mean, in counseling practice, it's not ethical to be coming to this sort of relationship, I mean, that is a proper counseling setting in a counseling group and so forth then. But these old folks you know they get sick of the food provided by the home. Morning coffee, two slices of bread, butter and jam or something, a porridge or something like that. Lunch time. Again, being old, you know, the center people assume that these old folks need soft rice, so they give porridge and some people cannot take porridge, they want hot rice, they don't want soft rice, so you get all of these complaints coming up and the complaints means, you know, they get to heightened level of anxiety, because they quarrel with the staff there and staff there once the quarrel starts or misunderstanding starts and staff would say, oh, this is a naughty patient and try to deprive the patient from supplying from certain privileges and all that and that creates more anxiety and finally depression comes in and anger and so forth comes in. Okay, so I'll ask, say, what would you like to eat, I say, next time I come, I'll get you something, and they will say, no, they would like to eat some fried noodles from which they've not eaten for the last three or four years, you know, that's how I build this rapport with them. Uhm, some has got a earning coffee, you believe it or not, they say the coffee in the home is terrible, they want to drink a coffee from the coffee shop, a local coffee, not Nescafe, alright, okay, just a bucket of coffee, that starts the ball rolling then after about one or two sessions, three sessions, they're okay. So to those who has gotten some anxiety problem, some problem, sometimes you want to get with talk a bit difficult, so we would say, okay, let's practice something, let's do something, okay, why don't you close your eyes and I close my eyes and just be quiet.

Yoga Nidra - mind passive 

00:41:30
Mindfulness of in-out breathing 

00:41:30
(anapanasati) - mind active 

00:41:30
JEFFREY PO How long? I say five minutes, okay five minutes. Okay, five minutes. Then after that, no. But first few session is a bit difficult also, because not even after 30 seconds they will open their eyes and see, trying to find out what is happening and whether have I brought a gun to shoot them, they're very suspicious, I said, close your eyes, okay, close the eyes, and then he opens up again, I said close your eyes, okay, I'll close my eyes. Then he said, when I close my eyes, what am I to do? I said nothing. But how can nothing. I said, never mind, just close your eyes. If -- I said, if you need to do something, just listen to your breathing, okay. How can I listen to my breathing? Okay, never mind, then listen to your heart beat, alright. Listen to the dub dub, oh, very frightening, alright. I said, that's your heart, it's inside there. And it beats, you know, it's been beating for the last 70, 80 years then and you're afraid of the beat. So you know, in that technique you get them into the first stage of being aware of the body, the physical. Before that they were not aware, they are just living from moment to moment then. Then we reach a situation of calmness when you get to -- you can talk to them and they know the trust has been created and they will come with lots of stories, you know, when I came here, I was like this, like this, you know, then this is not happen. I got a girlfriend and it was -- you know, then the girlfriend ran away with somebody and all that. Okay. So, in fact, Kretschmer, he says that, he does what is known as passivity of respiration. Kretschmer is a European, what to call, a medical doctor and he used to treat his patients with relaxation techniques also. And he again, he mentions about breathing. Now you'll find that in all meditation techniques, in relaxation techniques, breathing is important and one will have to slowly master the art of breathing. Although, there are so many types of breathing techniques, and if you got -- if you learn yoga, there is a lot of them, breath through the right nose and out the left nose, breath through the left nose, out through the right nose, breath in, count four times, hold eight times and breath out 10 times, you count 10 or whatever or breath in and don't breath out also can -- but not the last one, if you breath in and don't breath out, then you got to get a better a better medic ready or an oxygen tank ready. Okay, so -- but Buddhist meditation is easy. It's just a calm breathing, inhalation, exhalation, okay, a regular and observe your breathing and that's what I get 'em to do sometimes. I say, okay, observe your breathing. What for? I said, just observe your breathing. I breath one. I know you breath, okay, but can you observe the breathing? What do I do? Okay, if it's a fast breathe, then the observe is the fast breathe, if it's a slow breathe, then you observe is slow, if it is a deep, say it's deep, if it is a shallow, say shallow, if it is, you know, what to call it, prolonged, say prolonged and so you begin to observe your breathe whether it's a deep breathing, shallow breathing, and you know, they become more calm, they become more relaxed, alright. And that is when after they reached a stage, you can ask them a lot of personal questions, which they do not want to reveal to the center people, the staff there and all that.

water 

00:45:40
-Happich (1962) 

00:45:40
JEFFREY PO  Now, so in progressive relaxation, that's what Jacoberg does I think in some practices, what he will do is that he will ask the client to sit down, okay, or lie down on the floor, but I don't think they lie down on a floor, but sit down and from there to relax to tense up your muscle, okay, then release and you tense up your muscle again, you release, okay then you go up to your forearm, tense up the forearm, release and tense up, release, go to your shoulder, tense up your shoulder, release and you'll find that the person becomes quite relaxed then. Now, Yoga Nidra also -- they -- you'll create a passive mind after some time where you ask a person to lie down okay, in the corpse position, you can lie down with the back on the floor or a bed with your hand either -- palms up or palms down, okay and starting from your feet, your left feet, focus your attention until your toes, the big toe, second toe, third toe, small, the soul of your left feet, the heels, the ankle, the knees, and slowly you progress up to the abdomen, alright, then do it with your right leg and then do it with your right hand, left hand, the head, the hair, the eyes, the eyeball, the eyebrow, the nose, the nostril, the ears, inside the ears, you will be surprised. How many of you have ever focused into what's inside the ear? Never? Try it, you'll find a lot of different frequencies, real different sounds coming in. Okay. You'll begin to hear that your blood gushing around here, the back of ear then. When you do it at night, you'll find about three or four type of different sounds, one is the noises made by the cricket, alright, one is your own blood gushing and one is if you're a little bit with alcohol, then the cochlea there where -- also some frequencies which you tend to hear, but it got very interesting. Of course, I mean, do it without marijuana or heroin or whatever, okay. Alright. Then in mindfulness of in-out breathing anapanasati, uhm, you get the mind to be active then, because in anapanasati, your focus, your mind is, what to call that, fully concentrated. And if anapanasati is done well, it leads to what is known as very calm, very relaxed stage and in partition of anapanasati, they can bring themselves to an ultrastate of consciousness also, which in Buddhism we call it the different jhaning levels, different jhanas. Anyways, the word jhana is a Pali word from that word jhana, then later on when Buddhism went into China, there is a huge movement called jhan movement in Buddhist and from there it went into -- through Korea into Japan that we popularly know today as Zen Buddhism. Okay, so Zen Buddhism is of course origin on India with the word jhana there. Okay, the Zen word is actually, the root word is jhana. And jhana means, to be elevated to a different state of consciousness, okay. Now, okay, anyway just as a matter of interest, anapanasati, anapana means in-out and sati means mindfulness. So mindfulness of in-out breathing. 

00:49:55
The psychological exercises - 2 

00:49:55
Buddhist approach: 

00:49:55
Evoking sensation originating from the physical 

00:49:55
body and the mental aspect of the person. 

00:49:55
JEFFREY PO Now Happich in 1962 uses a western approach. He will get his clients or patients to visualize, meadows, mountains, chapel, sitting on a bench by an old fountain and listening to murmur of the waters. Unfortunately in Singapore, we got very little meadows, we got grasses, so usually I don't ask the old people to visualize on meadows and all that. Mountain, we've got one mountain called Bukit Timah and that's 500 feet high, okay, and that's all, so I don't use mountain, chapel or temple, sometimes yes, I do. And listening -- sitting on a bench listening to fountain waters, we've got very little fountains, when you talk to you a 85 year old men about fountain, he will ask you what is a fountain, okay. Now, but here you'll find that in Happich system, he walks through with them, with the patients or the client, when he asked them to meditate around these topics then. For instance, he will ask the client to close the eye, thereafter once the client is relaxed to visualize a meadow, alright and he will ask the client to describe what he sees in a meadow, the grass, is it fresh, or is it brown, is it green, are there flowers, what type of flowers, the color of the flowers, you know and he describes and from there Happich will analyze the mental frame of mind of that person at that time. And also from there, he will interpret what has happened, because if that guy keeps on saying that I see a burn of grass and all blank and all that, so it's all very negative and then he proceeds further treatment and slowly he -- as he goes on, he does his therapy, he will from a meadow, he will ask the client, okay, if the client is improving. Okay, from now, close your eyes, don't visualize the meadow anymore, visualize a mountain, and from that meadow, the path up the mountain, and along the path, a couple of sign post, now those sign posts are events of your life, can you describe. Can you tell me the story, what are your emotions involved, how do you feel and he uses a lot of emotion languages, not thinking languages, okay. Now in the Buddhist approach, okay, there is evoking on sensation originating from the physical body to the mental aspect of the person. So this is just what I mentioned to you about the mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of the breathe, mindfulness of consciousness and so forth. So we proceed bit by bit. But I do more on the consciousness being aware of the body first, alright. Because to get the elderly people relax, you got to get 'em to be aware of the body, so that their focusing and their concentration becomes more centered. 

00:53:45
The psychological exercises - 3 

00:53:45
Buddhist approach: 

00:53:45
Mindfulness of body 

00:53:45
sensations 

00:53:45
Mindfulness of feeling 

00:53:45
sensations 

00:53:45
Mindfulness of consciousness 

00:53:45
Mindfulness of 

00:53:45
"existentialims" 

00:53:45
JEFFREY PO Now, so we start with the mindfulness of the body sensation, mindfulness of feeling sensations, mindfulness of consciousness, mindfulness of existential topics. Now I did use this one case, there was this gentlemen, aged about 50. You know, he was a construction site supervisor before he had stroke, alright. And you know, as a construction site supervisor, you have to be a very active person, alright, giving directions to the electrical contractor, giving -- ordering the civil engineers and all sort of thing, so he is always shouting here, shouting there and you know giving instructions, giving orders everywhere. Now what happened was that one night, he had a stroke and he didn't know, it was a silence stroke and he couldn't get up the next morning then, okay. Finally, the family members found that he had a stroke, so send him to hospital and unfortunately it was not massive, but he was -- you know, the left hand side was paralyzed and he became wheelchair bound and sent to the Toa Payoh Rehab Center. Now, so I was -- after that I was -- they told me that this guy was depressed, didn't want to talk much, didn't want to get himself engaged with the others, you know, he meets them or not, so okay, I said, okay let me talk to him. So again, the first one or two sessions, there was this mistrust there, he was very suspicious of me and so forth because I'm in this speaking base and he is again direct speaking base, alright. Finally, I got to know what was bothering him and you know, he said, you know, the thing that bothered me was that I want to know why this happened to me and not the next-door neighbor or somebody else then. Why must be -- why must it happen to me? I'm so active, I'm a good guy, yes of course, I drink little bit, I go to Karaoke and all that, but you know, I don't womanize, I don't smoke, but why? So went into his religious background and I found out that he was a Christian, a Roman Catholic. I said, what about the church, did you ever discuss it with your priest or not. Ah, he says, yeah, he is useless. I said, what do you mean by useless? No, I asked him why it got, you know, me this way? I said, what did the priest say? He said, don't ask questions, carry on. He said, that's not the answer I want. And I said, okay, what happened after that? He said, every week, I'll ask the priest the same question and every week the priest will tell me the same -- give me the same answer then, don't ask too many questions, just carry on. Alright. Then -- okay, that makes him angry. He wants to know. So after that, then I say, okay, after a couple of sessions and I got him to do the -- to relax and he wasn't progressing very well, you know, his left hand. So I got him to do a visualization of his left hand and get him to imagine that his left hand is moving, alright, and you know, after three or four weeks he told me that, you know, he could feel some sensation on his left hand then, okay, and that is I think this morning when you heard about neuroplasticity, that's what's happening then, that neuropath has been -- as he visualize, he closes his eyes and keep on visualizing, visualizing, you're connecting by that neuropath. What happened is that, the dendrite will grow, okay, the spines, they're called the dendritic spines and these spines will somehow contact back with the synapse of the other neurons and slowly this path is moved. You know, you just like when -- when there is a grass there and when you walk through the grass again and again and again, slowly the footpath will be formed and that is you know what's happening in brain plasticity, so he felt encouraged. I said, look here, I mean, you could feel some sensation now, okay and because the rehab part wasn't you know helping him at all that much and they asked him to squeeze a ball, he can't squeeze a ball and he is paralyzed, you know and they ask him to try and lift and try and lift, he says, I tried, but he can't move them. So with that visualization technique, he felt encouraged. Then after that, I again, I spoke to him about asking the priest and all that and he says, yes, I'm still asking the priest and the priest cannot give me an answer. So one day I brought up some pictures of those African children, who are starving with big belly, all bones and all that and again pictures of men crawling totally nude, you know starving and all that. Then I showed and I said, would you prefer to be here or in the wheelchair? Then he started thinking, you know, then keep on looking at the pictures and I could see that tears were forming in his eyes and he said, I'd rather be me here than to be there. I said, so do you want move on again or do you still want to ask questions? I said, now you're getting some sensation, isn't it as we move on and on, I mean, you should be okay then. Then he says, yes, I think, I'll move on, alright and thereafter he did not ask any question anymore, alright, he didn't ask the priest. I said, okay. Then as we went through the consciousness, consciousness, I skipped consciousness, then about existential topics.

And finally, one day he told me yes, yeah, I think I have -- I have overdone, overdriven myself physically by shouting here, shouting there, being a supervisor, you know, and getting angry with people and all that. So I think, I said you are, your body is trying to tell you to slow down a little bit, you know and because you didn't slowdown, then you know this thing happened. But I mean, you are lucky that you didn't die. You were trying to say something. 

01:00:45
 (inaudible ). 

01:00:50
JEFFREY PO Okay. All right. So, so you see for -- through that system, I brought in from the body sensation to the feeling sensation and to essential topics then. But it took me about 15 sessions to go through with him, it was about once in two weeks or it took quite some time. 

01:01:15
The psychological exercises - 4 

01:01:15
The sublimation (transformation) of 

01:01:15
negative energies to positive energies 

01:01:15
JEFFREY PO Now, and again when you are doing the Psychosynthetic-Buddhist method, when you go into the person's mind, you can explore for yourself flashbulb memories, I spoke to old folks, old folks have got all the flashbulb memories, autobiography memories and what I'm trying to reminisce, past memories, good and bad. Many of them has got many past -- I mean very bad past memories. And you've got to work up those issues with them. But most of the time, I say, look here, what is past is past, I mean there is nothing that we can do. All right. In fact, if we look at things in a proper perspective, we humans, we don't own anything, we -- we come to Earth and we've taken everything from Mother Nature, Mother Earth. I mean the shirt I am wearing, the shoes, the cloth, the whatever it is, the spectacle, it's actually from -- from nature. But each of us, the only that we own, which we can rightfully call our own are our memories, which nobody can take away from us. All right. So there are good memories, there are bad memories. And for these old folks, I think when you talk to them, for them, many of them have got bad memories, which they own. All right. Slowly you've got to get them to you know, try to reduce the bad memories and get them to look forward to -- to whatever remaining years they have of their life.

JEFFREY PO Now, so in the technique, you'll find that there is a sublimation or transformation of negative energies to positive energies. Sublimation I think is a -- a Freudian language where you -- you move that energy from negative to positive, of one to another.

01:03:25

01:03:25
JEFFREY PO Now, so at a social level, many of them are abandoned, they are destitute, they are socially disengaged, they got social isolation and loneliness. Now you'll be surprised that although they live together, there's plenty of them that live together, but they don't talk to each other. And is difficult to get them -- get them to engage. I think there is a mistrust which is either or they've got this hypothetic what I call it, attitude. When you get them to see, why don't you talk to that -- the other guy there or the other (inaudible ) there. What for, there is no point. But you know that you know, if you don't get them socially engaged back into the community or into their home setting with the people there, they could drain themselves more slowly, you know, they -- what we call eating into your hearts, your own hearts. You go down, and down and down. Okay, tell me, I mean what is that here. We get up seven o' clock, bathe, they change the bed sheet, breakfast at ten o'clock and nine o'clock, we go down, we eat, go back to bed. 12 o'clock lunch, after one hour, go back to the ward, go back to the rooms. So there is -- there is no hardly any meaning there, but we are trying. And I try to get them into sort of a buddy system, I say look here and this is difficult because you want them to get into a buddy system where they say, they tell me that okay, I think I like this madam so and so, or I think I can get myself engaged with Mr. so and so then. Then you know, we'll I've to have to ask them, okay, then would you like so and so to share room with you or not because in one ward, there is six occupants, six beds there as if to share rooms. And I say, I don't mind because sometimes you know the roommates don't agree with each other and in the one room, you can have quarrels and shouting you know. There was one -- another inmate who complains to me each time he switches on the fan, somebody come in, come in, he switches off the fan, somebody else come in, you know and does that. So, then I have to discuss with the center manager, say look here, I mean this lady and this lady, they think they can become friends, can we put them together and I mean, and they can take care of each other also. If this lady falls down, at least there is somebody there to look after her, if she falls down, because many of them also have got weak legs, weak knees and all in.

01:06:15
JEFFREY PO Now again, many of them are emotionally drained, there is a sense of apathy ambivalent to events and situation, there is exhibition of frustration and irritation. So sometimes small issue will flare up. I will tell you one incident where there was this -- this 85-year old man, but he is mobile, 85-year old man, he is mobile, very sharp, still connectively very sharp, balanced well. Only thing is poor sight. But abandoned by the family. He has got one son, but it was the daughter-in-law who did not want him to be in the house. So because the son was married and the son favored the wife, so they finally put him to the home there. And he felt, you know, he felt very hurt that the son did not want him. So he always very angry and he's got his -- he is very irritated and there was one occasion where he asked the security guard to be let out of the home because he wanted to buy some food from the hawker center which is quite near. So she said, she cannot, if you want, you have to ask the superintendent to give a paper of release, then I'll open the door. Then they started a quarrel, I mean a sort of a, you know, some heated words and then follow a silly thing that the security guard says that, you know, don't talk too much, you talk too much, I'll -- I'm going to report you. Then he replied, if you report me, I'm going to hit you with my umbrella. All right. Then she replied, go ahead, you want them, he did boom!. So she went groggy she fell down. We have to call the police and all sort of things. So it does happen. And there was one more lady in the home, we call her the gangster lady, there was one incident where she doesn't like another lady, she just bumped through her. So the other lady, an 85-year old frail looking lady fell down, broke her hips and had to be hospitalized. So then I asked her, why did you hit her then, why did you push her. Oh, she never bathe, she's very smelly. So these are the small, small reasons that something and some incident would happen. Then we got to do a lot of anger management with these old folks, but it's tough when you know, trying to do anger management with old people because there's a lot of frustration, irritation there. The psychological levels, suicidal thoughts. Now, these suicidal thoughts sometimes, I am a bit also weary because being at that age, one has got to distinguish whether the thoughts are suicidal or merely thinking of death. You know, they are two things there. Now I mean in all fairness, I mean most of us think of death also, one way or the other because it is something that is an event that will happen. But suicidal thoughts are different. They will not only think of the death, they will plan for it, they will, you know, try to do something to -- to take away their life then. So although you know in this depression test and all that, sometimes you get psychologists coming on or medical doctors coming in and doing this medical, I don't know this depression screening and ask the question, do you have suicidal thoughts then. Now an old person just cannot distinguish, I mean those direct speaking, what is suicidal and what is just thinking of death. So you've got to be translate that, do you think of death, obviously they will say yes then. Okay, so the moment they say yes, in the report, client has got suicidal tendency, suicidal thoughts then. No. And there are number of times I had to intervene, and I said, no, no, no, she's not, she's not -- don't worry, she's not going to commit suicide, but she has thought about death. So these are the two different things. Anxieties over death issue, they've got low self esteem, low self valuation and a set of sense of hopelessness as are no direction.

Psychosynthesis: The formation or 

01:10:55
reconstruction of the personality around 

01:10:55
the new centre 

01:10:55
JEFFREY PO Now, so application to the elderly now, you've got the goal, you've got to know the detail knowledge of the one's personality. So usually before I start, I have to read the case history of the client. Then once I know about something about the client, we got -- I've got to do something to get the client to evoke another personality because if the client has got a lot of anger issues, a lot of anxiety issues, a lot of irritation issues, so low valuation, low self esteem, then the client has got to recognize that then, if the client does not recognize that, it become a bit difficult to proceed further. Now, so in using the psychosynthetic technique, the formation or reconstruction of the personality around a new center, now what this means is that, very simply, very often we associate an emotion to ourself, with ourself. I'm an angry person, I'm a loving person, okay. Now, if it is a negative emotion, it's not so good. If it's a positive, I'm a loving person, okay, not so bad, then. But the moment when you say I'm an angry person, you associate anger with yourself. All right. So anger is part of self of you. Now, in psychosynthesis, what they tried to do, or what Assagioli tried to do is that, separate anger from self. So instead of saying that I'm an angry person, you tell that guys, no, you are not angry person, you are okay, there's nothing wrong with you. But it is anger that made you angry. So if the person, the client can be convinced that it is anger that made the person angry, that made he or she angry, all right, then the thing that --. 

01:13:00
 Separating behaviors from the -- 

01:13:00
JEFFREY PO From the --, yeah, that's right. You separate it out then so and then that becomes easier to manage. Then I say okay, anger has made you angry. Can we talk to anger then. Okay, let's have a chat with anger. Okay. Then you know, then slowly the person will have their self awareness to find out what actually has happened inside the body then. Okay, this is what I mean is that, you -- this process of disidentification with an emotion okay is being separated so that that person builds up a new personality, a new identification. Now I use the word personality as a sort of a generator total, now but if you look into later developments of psychosynthetic thoughts, they will talk about a lot of sub-personalities. Okay, in a human, we've got many sub-personalities; okay, shy, timid, and all whatever it is(ph) will look upon it as traits. It's about the same, it's that language has to fill this all. And is because this sub-personalities that is in us that goes up and down and we are not able to manage, that's where began the problem. 

01:14:25
 Sir, how do you get into realizing upon one's true self? 

01:14:30
JEFFREY PO Say again. 

01:14:35
 You've got the third point down, realizing one's true self. How do you help to explore that? 

01:14:45
JEFFREY PO By getting them to realize and to accept the fact that they had to position there. All right. Now the true self, I should put the word true inverted commas then, all right. Now, it means that accept the situation that they are in a home, and the true self is that it's all that is in, that circle is there. Don't try to think that you want to do this or you want to do that or you want to get out or you want to do, you know. So now, but the true self in let's say in philosophical terms or in spiritual terms mean different thing then. 

01:15:30
 Yeah. 

01:15:30
JEFFREY PO Yeah. It's a different meaning -- 

01:15:30
 It's the same acceptance and situation but because you are going through the disassociating behaviors of personality and then you got disassociating personality itself, who you are beyond your roles, essence, is that what you mean? 

01:15:45
JEFFREY PO Yeah, that's right. 

01:15:50
 How do you engage that you know really? 

01:15:55
JEFFREY PO Uh, I don't go through that much in getting there because this becomes a philosophical, you know a sort of a higher level than you know, not so much elderly. So these are just historical background then. Okay, when we take into the elderly, when I get into the elderly, and especially with language difficulties, I don't go into this aspect a lot, small but practical aspect of get them to carry on with their life and to accept what position they have in their life. These are just -- 

01:16:30
 Then how do you get them to be set and derive? 

01:16:35
JEFFREY PO Bring them back to the real situation that relative -- this is apart of relative therapy then, then okay, you are 85 years old, all right. This is your situation, you've got no money, you've got no house, what else do you want then? Okay, that you are given three meals a day, four meals a day, you've got friends that you know, there is a choice, I mean there is a certain choice there, I mean at least they enjoy certain choices better than those in custody, the prisoners. The prisoners have no choice, but these at least in the old folks home, they have certain choices, they can decide what time go to bed, they can decide what sort of clothing they want to wear, you know, and they can decide whether they want to eat or they didn't want to eat, or some time they can decide to have a second cup of coffee or second cup of tea, which prisoners don't enjoy. So -- yeah. 

01:17:30
 (inaudible ). 

01:17:35
JEFFREY PO Yeah, that's right. And so you tell them, say, look here, I mean even they say you want to get out from this place, where do you go. Same as the -- I was also helping out in one of the mental home, but it's a home for you know the outpatients and 90% of them are on drugs already, on medication. And yet everyone wants to leave the home. I say, where do you go. So bring back him to reality and to tell him that the true situation is this and your true self is that you cannot, you cannot cope when you go out. You cannot manage yourself when you go out. Okay, some of us becomes a bit aggressive and you know, you then say look here. 

01:18:35
 (inaudible ). 

01:18:40
JEFFREY PO Yeah, there is betrayal and all that. 

01:18:50
 (inaudible ). 

01:18:55
JEFFREY PO  Okay, again, just now, I think there is this thing about individual society and collective society. Yes, in the collective system, I mean there is this family that looks after the elders or whatever, whatever that, but in Singapore, things are breaking down, you know and there are lots of young people who don't want the older to be around, they say they are a nuisance, they are a hindrance, and all that is very exciting. 

01:19:45
 (inaudible )How I'm hearing this is that finding that true self. You're helping them look for a different kind of freedom and to fre-create that new freedom within where- where they now are. As opposed to the freedom that they had before they went in there. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY PO Okay. Now, again it's a bit difficult for the old people. For the private client it's okay. When you talk about freedom of the mind and so forth, you can talk about spirituality, you can talk about religious values and where they defined the meaning of the true self and all that because they've got more options when they are private client, not in the home. But in the home setting, they've got less options. So finally I'll have to bring them to a level where again I see acceptance, and sometimes it's a bit difficult, acceptance that your own death is approaching, all right. So and I'll try to introduce some religious value to them, I say have you thought of you know, taking up some, some religious practices. If you are a Muslim, it's okay, but then if they are things like Taoist, then I say, okay, would you like to continue further, you know more about Taoism or become a Buddhist or become a Hindu or go to Church, or go to whatever it is then. So this is a spiritual part that is element that is being added in, but not to many people, just a few people. But I say I should have used the word true in inverted commas because that what true is with ambiguous or you know, debatable. All right, you can go on and on for arguing.

01:21:50

01:21:50
JEFFREY PO Now the so to control the various elements of the personality, we use the -- I use the anapanasati again. Then explore the negative elements of anger, regrets, discontentment, disidentify I mentioned. Then energy is set free.

Creation of a unifying centre: 

01:22:10
Setting up of "ideal model" 

01:22:10
JEFFREY PO Now creation of the unifying center. This is again back to Assagioli. He says that to set up an ideal model, meaning that within the confined sort of setting there, let's say, in an old age home, I say okay, what is your model, how would you project yourself as being living with acceptance in this old age home. How would you know, you know, think or how would you feel then? Then they were saying that okay, if -- if I'm here, it is what I would like to do, it is what I want, it is what I like to be here. I want some more freedom, I want this, I want that and so forth, a sort of an ideal thing. All right. Then I will have to you know probably tell them, okay, this you can't because there's restriction here, this cannot because of governmental regulations, you know and so forth.

Monitor and coordinate those 

01:23:10
energies 

01:23:10
JEFFREY PO So in psychosynthesis, you -- actually is transformation of the inner energies, we -- I use evocations, autosuggestion, creative affirmations or memory imaging. Then monitor and coordinate those energies. Autosuggestions, yeah, as we converse, we discuss, sometimes we can suggest or tell things to do them, sometimes, sometimes, they accept, sometimes, they don't accept them. But I think within a constraint of the home, with not much choices around, they would accept them. Memory imagination, what I try to do is try to evoke worth good memories because I think in their life, not everything is negative, there are moments of -- there are good moments of their life in the past. It's bound to be, which they may have forgotten, so I get them to reminisce and try to evoke that good situation or talk about their dreams when did it first came, what were their expectation, their dreams, their hopes and all that. Okay. Sometimes it is good to bring them back into a dream line, you know, they sort of have inside their head.

Karuna - Compassion 

01:24:35
Mudita - Sympathetic joy 

01:24:35
Uppekkha - Equanimity 

01:24:35
JEFFREY PO Now, then there is one Buddhist concept, which I found it very useful after that sort of maintenance then. This is what is known as a Braham Vihara or a sublime abode is to cultivate -- get into practice and to cultivate loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. 

01:25:00
The Brahama Vihara (The Sublime Abode) 

01:25:00
JEFFREY PO Now, I say there is a lot of anger, there is a lot of anxiety, there is a lot of frustration, there are a lot of irritation that goes on within the home, you know that. Even in a day care center in Toa Payoh it is wheelchair bound patients and yet when you go there, you can sense atmosphere of tenseness because they don't talk to each other and they are just waiting for time 5 o'clock for ambulance to come and pick them back and bring them home then. Now so as I deal with clients, one at a time, I will try to get them to do these to put them sort of back into their nature and usually from the Buddhist point of view, metta, karuna, mudita and uppekkha starts with the self. Now for instance, if I'm asking them to show some sympathy, some loving kindness to the your next door guy or to your some of the inmates down there. I'll have to start and I ask them, I say, first of all, do you love yourself? Many of them say, no, because you know I'm paralyzed, I can't move, I can't do this, I hate myself, people look down on me, you know, I have to depend on people. So these are first thing that we got to start with to love yourself, appreciate yourself and say at least you are lucky you are here. You are lucky that you are still -- there are still people who is willing to -- there is ambulance to take you back, there is people paying for you to come here although it is subsidized rate. Subsidized means there is still payment, the only difference is that payment comes from a taxpayer's money, not from the family, isn't it? It comes from the government and the government takes money from people like me and I say, look I am paying for your meal, so you don't. All right. You may say that oh, I pay $50 a month, but then the actual fee is about $1,000 a month to maintain you here, and who is paying the other $950? It's the taxpayers, people like me, they are supporting you here. So appreciate that you are here, appreciate your body, appreciate that you are still alive, appreciate that you are still breathing, love yourself. And so again, have compassion for yourself because without all these, without starting yourself, if you -- if a person cannot love himself or herself, if a person cannot be compassionate to himself or herself or have some sympathetic joy, I will explain that one, how do you show love and compassion to other people, isn't it? Now, this was mudita, sympathetic joy, is very deep. It means that -- 

01:28:00
 (inaudible )passion. If they're not loving themselves. Its very hard to find love in passion with someone else. You know? So what do you do to engage that love in self, and that compassion? 

01:28:10
JEFFREY PO  Uh, now again love is very wide generic word. Usually I would say -- 

01:28:25
 Love or passion. 

01:28:25
JEFFREY PO Yeah, no, no. That love is defined as altruistic love or love where of a mother who will go through the stage of giving her life up to save the child, unconditional, that's okay. Now, so this client whoever you are talking to need to be able to love himself first, of herself, appreciate that this body is doing the work that is supposed to do although you are paralyzed fair, I mean fair enough, but then your heart is still beating, your blood is still circulating, you are still able to talk to me, you are still able to think. So appreciate that you still can think, appreciate that you -- you still can eat and you don't have tubes around your throat to where doctors will have to pour in your liquid, appreciate that then, appreciate that you can hear me. All right. 

01:29:25
 Gratitude, gratitude. 

01:29:25
JEFFREY PO Yeah. And I mean love encompasses all that, I think all those qualities. Compassion, have some sympathy for yourself, all right. Okay, I tend to carry on then. Your lunch is coming. I've got still Singapore time here, it's 9:38 in Singapore. So I mean, just after breakfast. 

01:29:50
 Breakfast. 

01:29:50
JEFFREY PO Yeah. Okay, then let's get in. So see Appendix C, okay, I've got write up in Appendix D of this thing. Thank you and good night.
