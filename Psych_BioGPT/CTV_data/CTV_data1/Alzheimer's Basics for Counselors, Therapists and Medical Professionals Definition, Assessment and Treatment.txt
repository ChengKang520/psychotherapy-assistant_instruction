Introduction and Interview Conducted by Allen E. Ivey, EdD, ABPP Preface: Who is Dr. Alireza Atri? 

00:00:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Welcome. I'm Dr. Allen Ivey and I'm going to be interviewing Dr. Alireza Atri. 

00:00:40
Alireza Atri, M.D., Ph.D. Harvard Medical School Massachusetts General Hospital MGH Memory Disorders Unit 

00:00:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Ah, an outstanding cognitive, neurologist and you're going to find an awful lot about memory disorders, Alzheimer's and related issues in an incredible person and I think we're very lucky to have him here today. Before ah, you see him on the screen, I'm gonna show you ah, a little bit about his background. Ah, you'll see on the screen now, that in 1988, he graduated from UCLA ah, at 19, age of 19 in Mathematics. By 1997, ah, he had his Medical Doctor and simultaneously a doctor in Biomathematics. Ah, he is on the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. So, he has one incredible academic background and he obviously did it very early and very quickly. Ah, as we turn to the next slide ah, just to give you some facts about him. He's instructor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, he's got clinical appointments at the famed ah, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospitals and frankly many other clinical appointments. He's had at least 19 fellowships, awards and reached, research grants and we'll hear a little bit about some of his work. Over 70 articles and abstracts and that is continuing ah, endlessly. So, we're going to see a lot more from, from this ah, ah, young physician. 

00:02:10
Age 19: BS, Mathematics, UCLA Age 21: MS, Biomathematics, UCLA Age 24: Ph.D., Biomathematics, UCLA Age 28: M.D., UCSF Memory Disorders Unit and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Hospital Dept. of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience, Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), VA Bedford Medical Center MGH Memory Disorders Unit 

00:02:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY I find this very exciting ah, it's critical as we face an aging society that counselors and therapists realize that we are on the front line as far as the allied team, allied health team working with this issues. So, I welcome you to an immensely informative and I think incredibly important presentation. 

00:02:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Dr. Alireza Atri, it is a real honor for myself and the helping professions to have you with us today. Ah, I'm really looking forward to this session. I'll be sitting off camera and asking a few questions. Now, let's start with something really critical as we begin. You entered college at the age of 15 and by 27 you have both a Ph.D. in Biomath and an M.D. degree ah, at 27. Ah, this is a very different life than most people watching this video have had. Ah, how is this quick in academia and professional life been for you? In terms of your personal development and as a scholar, scientist and medical practitioner? We're very lucky to hear about you, first as a person... (crosstalk) 

00:03:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Hmm. 

00:03:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...then we'll get on with your presentation. 

00:03:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, Professor Ivey it's, it's ah, it's a pleasure for me to be here and ah, to talk to you and, and counselors, therapists and students ah, ah, about dementia Alzheimer's. Uhm, I appreciate your question. I ah, uhm, ah, I think I just feel very blessed. I'm a, I'm an immigrant ah, to this country. I, I left Iran uhm, after the rev, revolution when I was about 12. we went to England for a few years and then moved to Orange County California, so that's where I went to high school for a few years. And uhm, for us to be able to get out of Iran ah, during that difficult time, for us to all be together and for me to have this opportunity to uhm, that I think many people around the world don't have who are in many ways much more gifted and, and ah, but never get to develop. I felt very strongly that I've been given a ah, ah, a chance do and it was sort of my, my duty to ah, to this. And you know, for me it's, it's ah, it's been ah, uhm, it's a way of finding sort of meaning and purpose to my life. For me it's been to, try to integrate mathematics into ah, medical sciences and you know, my, my research involves understanding memory systems and how they may be affected uhm, in dementing(ph), illnesses and in aging. And then to use that to ah, hopefully detect changes very early so that when you do have medications that ah, change the processes ah, we'll be able to you know, affecting as most. 

00:05:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY But one thing that ah, really impresses when you think about your background and math and somebody so deep in academia and publication, you just see this as very distant people but Dr. Ali, I know you as a very nice guy. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI (laughs) Yeah. 

00:05:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Ah, could you tell us a bit about your family and your commitment to students at Harvard Med. And let's, mentorship is incredibly important in counseling and you have the mentorship award here- 

00:05:25
Hospital Mentor Award 

00:05:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY - from ah, Mass General. And you've also got the pictures of your beautiful children here. So, just tell us a little bit about ah, your family and your commitment to your students. 

00:05:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Well, I think it, it all comes back you know, what I derive, I think my passion for, from is, is people and I, I understood that very early on. Uhm, so I was, I did a undergraduate degree in Math. Ah, always my life experiences brought me back to understanding that uhm, you know, my- 

00:05:55
Passion for people and service 

00:05:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  -contribution would be also with people and to make this link. Uhm, and uhm, yeah, very, very few things give me ah, that, that much, that much ah, satisfaction and it you know, it involves ah, every interaction I have with, with anyone in it and any sort of walk of life. I think any interaction is a, is a, is a, is a opportunity to somehow impart good and do, and do, and do good. And uhm, and I think you know, growing gap actually, I remember in college I think to myself, well, what, what do I have to offer. There are all these you know, there, throughout history and it's very easy actually to feel sort of small. And I, at, at that young age actually I had to in some ways change my perspective about, about life and I thought to myself, "Well, you know everyday I'm gonna ah, as a mathematician think about [00:06:53.723]Delta I," and I called it "Delta Improvement" and I thought at the end of the day I'm going to think about what I've done today that it improved the world just a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...on, on the margin. Not thinking about the global sense that's you know, 

00:07:05
What have I done today for others? 

00:07:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI - ah, what I'm doing is not globally making a huge difference. I thought that Delta I and then I maybe ah, thought to myself that maybe my circle of influence in some ways over time ah, will grow as I you know, as I interact with people and learn from them and hopefully they can ah, you know, they can take something positive away from me and uhm, uhm, for me this is a very important to feel because I, I grew up, my father was in his 50's when I was born and I'm very fortunate that, that he actually uhm, we lived together with my family. He is in his 90's, his mid-90's and uhm, you know for me, ah, ah, it's a passion to understand aging and dementia and uhm, and obviously this doesn't happen in a vacuum. You need uhm, your family and, and, and loved ones to support you to do this. And ah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Wow. I, I love the sense of connection. Now, I think as you probably know one of my major interests in ah, academia is multiculturalism. Ah, how has that been for you as a Persian, as an Iranian coming to this country. 

00:08:10
Multiculturalism has an impact 

00:08:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY I think it's uhm, really important to state that you left ah, Iran because of the political situation. (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. Correct. 

00:08:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY And yet now, you, sometimes may run into issues being from Iran. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

00:08:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY How has that been for you and your family? 

00:08:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Right. Well, it's been challenging and I think there's ah, uhm, I think in all issues I, I'd, I'd later on and in the presentation I talked about how it feel like there is, there is ah, there is dementia same as agism that prevents us sometimes from realizing that, that uhm, people are undergoing their dementing process and from diagnosing them and treating them a certain way. And I think all, in my mind all prejudice comes from ah, lack of understanding, lack of knowledge, lack of ex, exposure uhm, sometimes insecurity and fear. And uhm, so I'm very upfront, I would say I'm Iranian-American. I'm a US citizen. Uhm, I came here because ah, you know, we had difficulties in our country and, and uhm, and ah, uhm, yes, sometimes you, you face ah, barriers here. Uhm, and ah, all, all , one can do is they just connect and ah, for them to realize that ah, at the core we're all the same. We're the same people, we want the same things and ah, so (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Can you give just one example or that you might have run into ah, or your family just one concrete example. 

00:09:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Oh, uhm, uhm, I could tell you that I, uhm, uhm, sometimes ah, at the airports or even my father coming in just a little while ago uhm, or actually my cousin who was born and raised in England, he's actually British came over to, to visit us a little while ago. He was held up for about two hours... (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...because of his name. Uhm, and uhm, but I, I, I'd sometimes uhm, I've been in situations that uhm, sometimes at meetings, even with very educated people and not realizing where I'm from uhm, they'll say something. Uhm, yeah, and ah, it's difficult but I think that again is an opportunity where one can, one can educate. Uhm, you know, there are misunderstandings about ah, uhm, about what goes on sometimes and ah, what the people want I think. The differences are between governments not between people. (crosstalk) 

00:10:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:10:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And I think that's, that's what people should understand. 

00:10:35
Chapter 1: Introduction 

00:10:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  So, we have a little presentation here today, ah, for you on, on Alzheimer's and Dementia uhm, and ah, as, as Professor Ivey ah, mentioned ah, I'm a cognitive neurologist so ah, this is what I do, this is my passion. I, I work in the Memory Disorders Unit at Mass General and at Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Uhm, I teach the Harvard Medical School, which(ph) I direct the, the second year neurology, Neurology course for them and uhm, 24/7 is basically what I, as I take care of patients and families with, with dementing illnesses and, and teaching, and, and research on this. And uhm, and, and hopefully we'll talk a little bit today about uhm, what is cognitive aging. How is ah, dementia different from that and what are the approaches that, that we should have as far as supporting people ah, and particularly ah, for you as counselors and therapists. Uhm, I usually, I'm gonna refer to some of my slides. Usually I disclose- 

00:11:40
See Dr. Alireza's professional disclosures in Chapter 12 

00:11:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI -that I'm involved in ah, a number of ah, things that with education and research including with the NIH pharmaceutical companies and, and I'm very proud of that. Uhm, uhm, ah, we need a, an alliance that, that, that, to cure I think Alzheimer's Disease and dementia which I think is gonna be a process, it's gonna occur for the next... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah(ph). 

00:12:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Thirty or 40 years so I'm, I'm very uhm, confident in the next five to seven years we'll have some disease modifying drugs that will actually work in the disease process, but they would have to probably get them very early. Uhm, so my first slide here, I actually start with a quote usually and I say, "Here as us to cure sometimes, to help often, to console always." And this has been attributed to many different people for hundreds of years, but particularly to a Canadian uhm, physician who treated tuberculosis and at that time they certainly didn't uhm, treat tuberculosis. (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Hmm. 

00:12:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And I use it as, as, as an inspiration in many ways. That uhm, certainly a lot of things we do in, in medicine and uhm, counseling and therapy are chronic things that uhm, can't be cured at this moment, but there's always an opportunity to help them and, and consult them, (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah(ph). 

00:12:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI we shouldn't forget that. Ah, ah, then I will also use ah, some humorous slide- 

00:13:00
Where are the cartoons? Copyrighted, they cannot be shown here--sorry, they are fun. He'll describe them Use your imagination! 

00:13:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI -which I'll describe to this one as ah, a gentleman talking to a duck and ah, so as you know, as [non-English narration] and then quack, quack, quack and, and hopefully ah, we'll be able ah, speak the same language at the end. 

00:13:15
Chapter 2: The Scope of the AD Tragedy 

00:13:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  The scope of the AD, Alzheimer's Disease Tragedy and I have a graphic here, ah, a pie chart that is a forecast by the Alzheimer's Association. Uhm, ah, that currently estimates about five million people as having Alzheimer's disease in the United States, and as you can see over the next uhm, 30 to 40 years the estimates grow up to 7.7 million in to, to 2030 and 16 million in 2050. And the biggest chunk as you can see from the graph here is uhm, 85, 85 plus years old. Ah, and that's because ah, people are living longer and ah, uhm, ah, the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and dementia is still age. Uhm, and ah, you know, with our baby-boom generation coming to that age ah, of high risk uhm, unless something's done, you know, we are gonna have a lot of Alzheimer's disease. Uhm, (clears throat) here's a graph that shows the Incidence of Dementia as a function of age, as you can see many different studies uhm, really the risk starts to take-off in, in people at 70's. And uhm, ah, I sort of bro, uhm, broken it down here but the prevalence of dementia is roughly doubled every five years after age 65. So, the general estimates are maybe one to two percents of ah, 60 something years old and by the time 65 is four to five percent. 

00:14:55
90 year olds: >50% For comparison in Native Chinese prevalence in 60+ year olds is 2-3% (illegible text) 

00:14:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI So that's you know, that's not ah, uhm, that's not a small prevalence so four to five percent, one out of 20 in many ways. And of 70 year olds about 10 to 15 percent, 80 year olds probably 20 to 30 percent and 85 plus years olds 40 to 50 percent. So uhm, that's the bad news maybe but what, and there's also good news in this, you know, that means it actually then you know, over half of 85 plus, plus year olds don't have dementia. Ah, even though probably they had changes in the brain that are uhm, ah, consistent with Alzheimer's disease, for some reason we don't understand why, some people are more resistant to that. Uhm, and, I, I will try to make in this presentation today a distinction between disease, Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's Dementia. Ah, when I say Alzheimer's disease ah, many more people actually probably have the disease because you don't catch this overnight.(crosstalk) 

00:15:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:15:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI It's something that develops over, we understand now over five or 10 years or more. This are changes that are happening in the brain uhm, they are ah, probably toxic proteins that are going around and destroying synapses, the connections of neurons in the brain. And at some point, they've be five, 10 years down the line depending on how much kinds of reserve one has, one will show symptoms. But that just like heart disease, it didn't happen overnight, you know, the minute one has the heart attack isn't necessarily the minute one developed Atherosclerosis in, in, in the heart vessels. Uhm, so, ah, so in that sense uhm, ah, you know, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to, to hopefully ah, understand and intervene early. Ah, once we have also disease modifying drugs and to actually modify risk factors for Dementia, we'll talk about that. But I like to use this quote from John Donne which I'll read for you says, "No man is an island, entire of itself. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." And I think that's ah, ah, very uhm, ah, important uhm, thought and the truth. Uhm, very few of us are gonna escape this uhm, personally ah, professionally certainly ah, as counselors and therapists uhm, you'll be a ah, faced with ah, behaviors and thoughts and feelings uhm, anxieties, depressive symptoms uhm, that very much will ah, affect people's behaviors and, and, and emotional states. Ah, in especially in older, older people one has to think that could this be the beginning of, of, of, of a neurogenic process. Ah, but the fact that the bell tolls for all of us, uhm, ah, means that if, even if one is fortunate enough not to have it one's family or have had friends who were affected, ah, the next slides shows the cost of Alzheimer's disease to society which are estimated to be about 150 billion dollars per year and to put that in, in perspective that's above what we spent at this moment uhm, probably in the war in, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. It's a lot of, that's, that's a lot and, and most of this still borne out by their family members. And uhm, and the estimates are that uhm, ah, by 2015 it's gonna be maybe $190 billion and by 2030 maybe even a trillion dollars. It's just staggering. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:18:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And when you think about the cost of nursing home placement. (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:18:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI In 2003, the, the cost was about $55,000 an average and that doesn't include medications uhm, around the Boston area where we are, the cost is about $6-9000 a month. And, so it's a big public health issue too, so anything we can do certainly to, to have people be supported at home, ah, before they're, they're, they're placed in nursing homes and to, to delay that it's gonna actually uhm, save society a lot ah, economically. 

00:18:50
Chapter 3: Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Overview 

00:18:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Ah, as an overview of Alzheimer's Disease I, I'd like to talk about uhm, why early diagnosis and treatments ah, and standards of care and should be. Uhm, talk about early treatments and the focus being non-pharmacological things uhm, that you can do as therapists and counselors. Uhm, ah, o, a, are very important. Uhm, as, as clinicians uhm, I think one of the things we wanna is to eliminate and avoid unnecessary medications. Uhm, and we like to teach people about behavioral inte, interventions things like redirection, reassurance uhm, and, and generally to promotes uhm, you know, good mental, physical and social activity and general health. (crosstalk) 

00:19:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY I think the important thing here you're saying is that, even though we are not physicians, the counselor, the therapist can have a very significant role in helping people stay on their own, dealing with things to (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:19:59
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely, absolutely. Our team is uhm, the multi-dissimilarity team. Uhm, I consider ah, my colleagues I worked with, uhm, social workers, therapist, counselors, uhm, our office staff has been really the front lines and uhm, uhm, this is a condition dementia ah, and kind of impairments, a condition that doesn't just affect the patient but also affects the broader community and, and family. And uhm, uhm, studies have shown that, that interventions that are social interventions, behavioral interventions, ah, emotional interventions have effect sizes... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...that are similar to some of the medications we give. Uhm, and that makes sense. And the role of therapists and counselors is very important in supporting and promoting the emotional health of patient and caregivers. We talked about what sort of things will actually allow patients to, to stay at home longer. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:20:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and so I have shown you take care of the caregivers and people can stay at home longer. (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and it's also very, very important what therapists and counselors do is actually to assess uhm, the environment, the patient's environment as far as uhm, safety and uhm, ah, and, and, the fact that the, this are vulnerable individuals. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, they can be taken advantage of. Uhm, so that's very important. It's not ah, well, I, I, as you know, ah, I'm very passionate about this. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And ah, ah, sometimes I can be provocative and then(ph) later on I, I have a question that I posed. Ah, and I'll posed it to, to ah, to the audience uhm, as far as you know, what group of people recognized dementia first. Ah, and my answer may, may surprise you, it's, it's mentally provocative but that's a place where the intervention of, of therapists and counselors would be very, very important to prevent people from being harmed. Uhm, and, and ultimately it's very important for people to ah, to be able to, to understand uhm, not just their disease but their illness. (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI How the disease affects them and how you know, early on what their wishes would be... (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...as far as for future care needs and medically, legally and personal things. And I think that those are the things that uhm, that ah, clinicians can help with and, and, and counselor and therapist can help with even more. 

00:22:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY And this is one of the points or the real reasons we have here is typically counseling and therapy have not paid much attention to older people but finally now, we are waking up. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

00:22:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY And the issue is Alzheimer's have been something out there totally medical and yet when it come to treatment and support ah, counselors and therapists are very central. 

00:22:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. Uhm, because one of the take home things that I would like people to, to take from this video is that, is that I think of uhm, dementia as affecting four things really, four main domains. And traditionally, it's been cognition that's been... (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:23:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...sort of you know, memory and language function and reasoning ability... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and vision and spatial skills that have dominated our, our thoughts about dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  But really what affects people, is not whether they can do calculus backwards in their head ah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:23:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI but really how they function at home and, and in that community. 

00:23:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI How they behave... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...ah, you know, with their family members uhm, in their quality of life. And, and how, how that affects you know, their environment and, and family. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:23:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI So as you can see you know, (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Very protection(ph).(crosstalk) 

00:23:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  At least three out of those four things or things that are uhm, as certainly in the domain of, of, of counselors and therapists to be able to effect very much. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm, yeah. The sense, ah, some counselors will end up being assistant case managers. 

00:23:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  That's right. 

00:23:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:23:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right. Uhm, and, (clears throat) to continue the, the overview we'll talk a little about what our pharmacological treatments options are now uhm, and the fact that ah, you know, in 2008, what we have for the most part are symptomatic ah, therapies that worked on symptoms to slow... (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:24:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...sort of the decline of symptoms overtime. And you know, unfortunately the, the paradigm of treatment right now, is that uhm, eventual decline is part of the treatment. And so there are a lot of myths right now about Alzheimer's disease, about the treatments, that you know, the treatments only work for six months or a year, (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI they only work for some people. Uhm, the studies haven't really pointed that out, I mean that the, the medications for groups uhm, really work at, at all the different stages uhm, it's just that the disease progresses. And uhm, uhm, and, and, and you know people will decline despite treatments. 

00:24:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:24:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, as a very quick, quick overview it's, it's, it's always interesting to understand where we came from as far as understanding of dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. Here's a picture here of Professor Alzheimer who actually was a psychiatrist. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, and you know, I, I think there's an artificial divide between psychiatrist, psychology and neurology I think of it all as ah, one. 

00:25:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:25:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And uhm, and just like Alois Alzheimer was ah, psychiatrist for, he was a neurologist. (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:25:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Ah, and this is Professor Alzheimer who in 1902, uhm, this woman here August D, who (clears throat) was only 51 at that time and was admitted to a mental insti, ah, hospital. Again not because of the fact that she was just forgetful which she was but because she was paranoid, she had delusions, she had hallucinations, she had erratic behavior. And those are the kind of things that get people into nursing homes and, and, and ah, ah, hospitals like that. And uhm, Alzheimer's was getting into pathology and, and, and looking at the brain at that time and unfortunately, she died so this was 1901, 1906 she died and he examined the brain and describe this you know, plaques and tangles and, and atherosclerotic changes in the brain. And by 1910, time this was coined Alzheimer's Disease but it was coined as a pre-senile dementia. Just even that word, senile how dementia has a certain sort of connotation that biased to it in some ways. (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and sort of you know, the, the thought that ah, the thought that you know, as one ages equating aging with senility. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:26:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, it turns out until you know, this is 19, 1901, 1906. In 1960's, the textbooks of neurology are still talking about ah, Senile Dementia being caused by hardening of the arteries, atherosclerosis and you see, so, so the progress is slow. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Slow. 

00:26:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Slow and it wasn't until the 70's and the 80's when people started realizing hold on, this thing we thought that was you know, ah, pre-senile dementia, Alzheimer's Disease is probably the main cause of senile, ah, senile dementia too. And we better do something about it 'coz the baby boomers is gonna get, gonna get to that age. And uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Wow. 

00:27:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI and uhm, and so, the, so the pendulum kinda swung to more Alzheimer's Disease being the main culprit and it's probably as well we'll talk you know, a counselor about only 60 to 70 percent of neurogenic dementias in the elderly. (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Ah, but you know, the brain doesn't live outside the body, it's, lives inside the body. It's connected with the blood vessels and so everything that affects the blood vessels is gonna effect uhm, you know, the, the brain itself. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And our understanding currently is that there's, there's not just an additive effect of having Atherosclerosis and difficulty with poor functioning vessels in the brain and Alzheimer's Disease, but actually, there's a synergistic effect, so, that if you have one, and you have the other, uhm, they really synergize to make things much worse. 

00:27:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and so this is our opportunity again uhm, as clinicians, counselors or therapists to promote uhm, healthy lifestyles including ah, physical activity. 

00:28:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, I maybe misunderstanding just a little bit here 'coz I thought hardening of the arteries and ah, that its actually it sounds me like a different word for that is that really is this plaques building up in, in the, in the, in the blood vessels of the brain ah, which really is di, a far, a far different issue from ah, (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. 

00:28:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY the tangles and tubulars and so forth. You know (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. The plaques, that's right, so you, you, you, you, you got it exactly right. So, the plaques that we usually find in the blood vessels uhm, that most people think about asthero, atherosclerotic plaque this was more a cholesterol lipid. Uhm, so the plaques that we talk about that I'll show are of this amyloid protein that for some reason uhm, doesn't get ah, cleared way or gets made too much and the deposits in the ah, brain parenchyma between the nerve cells and we call those amyloid plaques. Some of those same types of amyloid, not the same one, but some, some of that same type also deposits in, in the, in the wall of the blood vessels. Making them also very dysfunctional, friable (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:29:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI they can leak, they can give little, little ah, hemorrhages what people don't know, having a little stroke for example. Uhm, and together ah, both the, the disease of the, the blood vessels and the, the, the plaques and tangles that, that accumulate in, in the brain... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  ah, act synergistically in many ways to cause. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Ah, so you really describing a more systemic approach and ah, most of us including myself had thought about, "Okay." 

00:29:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right and I feel the pendulum is, is swinging back again to understand that it's not just one or the other. 

00:29:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. 

00:29:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, so anyhow I ah, I as mentioned to you, ah, I, I'd like to use humor a little bit so ah, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:29:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ah, I have a cartoon to here, it, it depicts ah, (clears throat) a man in a red cape and ah, ah, and, and, and blue outfits ah, standing outside on a window ledge. Ah, he looks quite old and ah, there's an older woman next to him and the gentleman's kind of, on the window ledge basically about to jump out of the window and he says, "Dang, now, where was I going?" (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

00:30:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And the... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY But I, I gotta say because of copyright issue we cannot show the cartoon but they are hilarious. (laughing) And I see this guy lookin' out of the window. I'm now figurin' out, "Why," it's kind of like ah, me going to a room and say, "No." Why did I go into that room? And it's... (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right, right. So, so (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...there goes this, this exaggerates the... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Exaggerates that. (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah? 

00:30:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right, that tough feeling we've all had. 

00:30:35
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:30:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  It says, "Dang, now, where was I going?" And then, and then the caption says this is superman in his later years. (laughing) And ah, again you know, I, I used this, this exa, this exaggeration to make a point that uhm, actually Superman uhm, didn't get to this point overnight. 

00:30:55
AD is a gradual process - NOT a sudden event 

00:30:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI He didn't you know, catch ah, dementia or Alzheimer's overnight and uhm, uhm, and I, I make this point to you know, students or residents and fellows, and, and fellow clinician and colleagues that this is a process that occurs. And that you know, sometimes actually it's very, very difficult to recognized early signs of, of dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. Ah, and people with, with high intelligence, high functioning, a high education, uhm, they can go on for years before, before people recognize this as a, as it's(ph) actual symptoms. Uhm, and here are the graph showing ah, that ah, that you know, this, this is a process that occurs in years and ah, you know, on the Y-axis whatever measure you would like you know, cognition, function, behavior. Ah, we understand that there's probably some trajectory that's different from normal aging. Uhm, you know, that, that Alzheimer's Disease you know, overtime, what happens is that you ultimately, you know, when you are down here, in this range uhm, you know, finally we get, we recognize that there's dementia. But probably for years before that, people are going through intermediate stages which were now called, "Cognitive Impairments or Mild Cognitive Impairment."(crosstalk) 

00:32:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And the, particularly the amnestic type. The one where memory is, is, is involved very early and prominently. This are people who are functioning very you know, quite well. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Ah, but if you test them, they may have complaint but if you test them, they will... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...score on tests of memory and, and cognitive function. The lower they should based on other previous... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah(ph). 

00:32:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...ah, baseline or known education or, or intelligence levels. And yet, they're functioning well in society. And we know that people, you know, usually go through that and those intermediate stages for years before we understand ah, you know, and, and something happens with the checkbook or with the car or ah, that can be ignored by their family. 

00:33:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:33:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, these are the plaques and tangles I talked about. These are uhm, these are (clears throat) plaques right there, these are amyloid plaques, they're deposited between nerve cells. These are these tangles we talked about. So, the amyloid plaques are made up of these toxics proteins, amyloid protein and uhm, the tangles are inside ah, the nerve cells. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And in some ways they sort of strangle the nerve cells. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

00:33:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, by disrupting the, the cyto, cytoskeleton, the architecture that allows food and nutrients and things to go down ah, that the length of the, the neurons. And they come later so these are, these are called tangles... (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:33:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...made by po, tap(ph) proteins. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Now, I assumed that's ah, ah, post-death ah, slide, is that right or? 

00:33:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, this one is, that's right. 

00:33:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Are you able to get to that low of detail now with ah, MRI's and so forth? 

00:33:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Ah, we're not quite there yet, but we'll talk a little about how we're as, ah, from research methods uhm, there are things using Positron Emission Tomography... (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...where uhm, researchers are labeling uhm, compounds that are (clears throat) going into the brain and, and hopefully ah, getting to some of these amyloid and maybe some, to some of the tangles. I have, (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY So, we are heading toward ah, (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI We are all heading to that towards the...(crosstalk) 

00:34:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY ah, objective diagnosis. 

00:34:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. And in, in some ways we'll, ah, I'll talk about clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and that's, it's another ah, myth that comes out where people say, "Well, you know what, you, you, you can't diagnose Alzheimer's Disease until your dead or you have tissue. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And uhm, well, uhm, for 20 something years we've actually had clinical criteria. So, we have clinical criteria of depth in Alzheimer's Disease, probable Alzheimer's disease, possible Alzheimer's Disease. 

00:34:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:34:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And the probable Alzheimer's Disease diagnose it doesn't mean, you probably have it, it means actually, you know, you know, the patient fits the clinical criteria for it and... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY  Yeah. 

00:35:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and someone like myself, maybe a surgeon or a specialist, is about 95 percent correct. Uhm, the five percent that we're not, ah, it's usually a cousin of Alzheimer's Disease or Frontotemporal Dementia, Lewy Body variant of Alzheimer's Disease. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Ah, it's not something else that is, is outside the rail, realm incurable. And, and the clinical criteria allow us actually to move forward during life so we can actually... (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  give the treatments. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:35:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI and actually isolate tissue by itself. It cannot make the diagnosis, with pathologist now after death. And when the report comes back, it doesn't say Alzheimer's Disease, this brain you know, it says there's uhm, ah, there's uhm, ah, you know, broke(ph) and broke(ph) stage five out of six or six out of six, (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:35:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI meaning that there, there's so many neurons that are involved and this areas it's have plaques and tangles, and they'll say clinical correlation during life. So, you need to have, that also during life to get the, the definite diagnosis. 

00:36:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I think one thing I'll put in the leader guide and I'll put together from your... (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Sure. 

00:36:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...talk is ah, I think that there's eight stages of Alzheimer's that you've identified and I think it might be useful to have that for handout for therapy and various(ph) reference. (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Sure, sure. Ah, to know, understanding that, you know, with, with the caveat that, that not everybody goes in the same stages (laughing) and if, if you break him, you know, if you... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Sure. 

00:36:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...break him down to our function and behavior... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:36:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and cognition and how it affects family members ah, people can be at various stages. There are people who can perform very well on cognitive tests and really not behave very well and function very well at home. Ah, and alt, and there are people who do very poorly on cognitive sense(ph) and sliding and the other behavior is very good and they function quite well in their own regimented, ah, environment with support. Uhm, but, but to understand the general uhm, symptoms and as they progress I think would be helpful as a guide. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:36:55
Causes of AD 

00:36:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, I won't go very much into, you know, the hypothesis of, of what, you know, we think currently involves uhm, the, the seed and cause of Alzheimer's disease. Ardent to, to tell you that age is a big risk factor. And these amyloid proteins that we don't completely understand the function of, that we, we make at some time either we make to much uhm, or we don't clear ah, the, the toxic kind and (clears throat) ultimately what happens is that uhm, whether it's our age, environmental factors or genetic predisposition uhm, involves this altered metabolism of both these amyloid protein and this tau protein and we end up getting, you know, dysfunction and ultimately distraction of synapses which, which are connections in the brain... (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and then ultimately networks. Networks in the brain that support memory function, language function, major spatial function, executive function, organizing, planning, uhm, multitasking and, and ultimately leads to, leads to cell death but uhm, you know, as you can see in this, in the slide ah, a lot of the stuff is happening years, years before. We actually you know, get down... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:38:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...here and show symptoms and, and probably our genetic predisposition ah, plays at least 40, 50 percent ah, uhm, ah, risk, you know, you know, ah, accounts for that and, and, and probably I think years from now we'll understand that it's probably even much greater than that. 

00:38:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Is there ever a test for those gene shot? 

00:38:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI We don't. We, we only have test for ah, you know, handful of genes uhm, that are involved uhm, in ah, you know, relatively few, only a few percents of, of, of cases. Ah, but for the most part it's really only the ti, tip of the iceberg and, and there's probably this interaction between, you know, you, it could be age and genetic disposition and some of them are the factors. 

00:38:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  So picking back here on the, on the question as far as, you know, what are the changes in the brain that we may see. Ah, here's a slide that, that shows that, you know, by the time that people uhm, get diagnosed ah, with Alzheimer's disease and oftentimes that's in the mild or moderate stages. Uhm, looking at their brain, the blue areas here uhm, show basically tangles and the, the tangle tends to start in the mediotemporal lobe and hippocampus area this is an important area that integrates new knowledge, (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI makes associations. It's not necessarily where the memories are stored uhm, but it's where, you know, ah, sort of divergent ah, stimuli come to get ah, coalesced. (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And then, and then sent out to be stored at different parts of the brain. Well that time ah, as you can see there's, there's a, you know, blue all over it, so tangles all over. And they get to spread out to all other areas. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And some of the areas that are really spared until late are sensory motor areas. Uhm, and often time later in the, in the disease uhm, it's not that patients are week it's actually they forget how, the motor program how to coordinate things together. 

00:40:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:40:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI But taking the clock back and you can see from this uhm, from the slide even in the stage of mild cognitive impairment where people only showing, you know, maybe changes subjectively or on tests... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...in performing less than they should be ah, already there's widespread damage and tangles. And pre-symptomatic AD is, is well we, you know, folks that uhm, probably even before that. That they're not really showing any major changes that we can detect ah, and yet you know, some people think that the, you know, the first two tangles you get is, is already a, a sign that you're on the path uhm, and so. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And we would have an immense number of people that basically passed away from cancer, heart attacks, et cetera. (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. 

00:41:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, we actually have more Alzheimer's going on than, (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Disease. 

00:41:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Correct. Ah, than really ah, in terms of the numbers... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. 

00:41:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...the deaths. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI So, it's the tis, tip of the iceberg what, the statistics we're showing... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...you because again making that distinction between the disease in the brain, (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:41:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ah, and having the dementia almost like, you know, just to say we're dying of, of uhm, ah, folks who died in their 20 to 30's and, you know, motorcycle accidents or, or something else or trauma, and...(crosstalk) 

00:41:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:41:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...seeing that they were already developing ah, ah, you know, coronary and artery(ph) disease and atherosclerosis. (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:41:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, so this, this will be akin to that, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I see. Now in the first slide ah, the blue areas that hit first are. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Are uhm, the Mediotemporal lobe. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mediotemporal lobe. 

00:41:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Mediotemporal lobe the ah, areas around the hippocampus... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY The hippocampus, okay. 

00:41:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and ah, ah, around it's running(ph) on. (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY They're just strained(ph) on? 

00:41:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Yes. 

00:41:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI So again uhm, once we do have therapies that will change the course, it's imperative that we, we catch it earlier, you know. 

00:42:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:42:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, I have another slide here, a little cartoon and ah, it's a, it's a person on a desert island ah, there's only one, one, one tree, it looks like and uhm, it's a palm tree and he sort of raising his hands up like this and sees, and he's written on, on the ah, ah, on the beach there H-E-L-F, helf. And then we have this pilot looking down from the plane at, at the sky and he's looking on the radio and saying, "Wait, wait cancel that I guess he says health(ph)." So, you know, you could hardly blame this poor guy in the desert island. He's starving... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Right, uh hmm. 

00:42:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and he's, you know, he's misspelled clearly there's a problem here with, (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI uhm, connection, understanding the, (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:42:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  the context of what's going on that, you know, the problem is with the pilot. (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:42:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI It's not just the language problem here that is going. And I put that in there uhm, to be, to touch and make a point. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY  Uh hmm. 

00:43:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and usually at this point I, I asked folks uhm, " You know what, what segment of society do you feel ah, recognizes dementia and, and others first?" Uhm, and I'm being provocative here I'm not necessarily right but I'm, I'm being provo, provocative to make a point. And then you know, typical answers are actually is, many people will say actually that the patient himself may, may notice something. But in a more on, more on answer, usually it's the spouse or caregiver or children uhm, some people will say clinicians, you know, and uhm, but I, I said those are all, all wrong. Uhm, and I'm being provocative by saying that the group that diagnoses and recognizes the dementia first are unscrupulous telemarketers. Why do I say that? Now, usually people will shake their heads and says, " I'll get it." Because dementia isn't just forgetting new experiences, memory loss, it's also lack of judgment, lack of insight, and this is my point that people can prey ah, on the elderly and that's a big business to prey on the el, elderly uhm, because I think some of these unscrupulous folks who are into defraud, the elderly, understand the epidemiology of dementia and Alzheimer's better than we do as clinicians. They know that, "Okay well, you know, study show that ten percent of people on, you know, in their early 70's have, have dementia." So if they have a list of your call list of 100 70 plus year olds. They're gonna call them up and, you know, by chance they're gonna get ten, ten who were potentially demented and maybe they'll get two or three of them... (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY  Oh. 

00:44:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...to buy a trinket for a few dollars and then they'll send them some, you know, 50 dollars for shipping and handling, next thing you know, they'll be on every, everyone else's ah, lists and they'll get their bank account numbers. And sometimes they can get money out. And I have data to support this in some sense. Ah, here we, we show that ah, at every stage of dementia uhm, unfortunately only about 60 percent or so ah, of people get diagnosed and even less get treated pharmacologically. Uhm, and it's unbelievable, I mean to, to understand why that, that should be because the one, the first thing you wanna do is to prevent people from being harmed ah, and be taken advantage of. And, and I, in, in, in the part, in the severe, I mean the severe, severe stage of dementia I mean it should be obvious that someone is demented. Why aren't people, again(ph) diagnosed and treated then. I mean what are the factors that are, are there cultural factors, are there patient-centered factors, family-centered factors, are there clinician-centered factors, and I think all those has go in to that. I think again part of dementias and agism could, works into that to that you know, so and so, and he's senile now and he's older we can't do anything but that's the way it should be... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, what I, (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...which I would argue is not the case. 

00:45:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY hear really is a social justice dimension of how can we as therapists, it isn't just doing therapy... (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right. 

00:46:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...it's looking at the ah, sometimes where I would, the word I'd use is repressive(ph) society I, I know ah, I do, I never really saw ah, my wife's mother as demented but I do know probably from the time she was in her early 70's we really tried to watch when she had have a new air conditioner, et cetera because we never really knew ah, whether or not we're given a straight story and even now here in my, in my own retirement in Sarasota, is when I get a large bill and am I getting ripped-off because they know I don't know what I'm talking about particularly because I'm a Northerner down there. (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, so it, it is an important issue that you, (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI It's a huge issue and, (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY A huge issue. 

00:46:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI A huge issue, and again I have some data and I've a slide here from the New York Times that says, that saying a very, very big, big bank was, was found ah, guilty and ah, will actually settle, it says, "The settlement ends a Federal investigation to the accusations that the bank allowed telemarketers to use its accounts to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims." And ah, there's a picture of this gentleman here sitting here with, with, I would presume a son here. And this, this elder gentleman actually died before he received any, any, any ah, any compensation. Uhm, and you know, the settlement look was, was ah, as much as hard earned 144 million dollars. And they were allowing the telemarketers actually, you know, once they get the routing number sometimes of the checks and they will just withdraw ah, continue withdraw money and, and ah, it's tough. And that's, as one of the things that again at the front lines therapists and counselors are, are many times at the front lines when people are starting to, to have neuropsychiatric and behavioral and emotional symptoms that are ah, likely due to ah, a impending dementia. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Then of course the stress dealing with that increases their, the rate of dementia. 

00:47:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Correct. That it, it, it's ah, certainly affects ah, their, their, their symptoms uhm, absolutely and maybe even underlying pathology. 

00:48:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

00:48:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, so I've, I've a, ah, a little picture here that there's a gentleman at, at a cocktail party. Ah, his (laughing) outstretched hand to another gentleman they're both in suits and the one guy says to other one says, "Hi, I'm, I'm, I'm, you'll have to forgive me I'm terrible with names." Okay so an exaggeration usually people don't forget their own names but uhm, it is a very, very common complaint. Ah, maybe one of the most common complaints of, of people as they get older having difficulty retrieving people's names. And ah, it's a difficult task and we're all louts some of that. And uhm, uhm, you know I ah, ah, I just turned 40 a few days ago and ah, I'm not immune to ah, having some retrieval difficulties now particularly when I don't sleep or if I'm more stressed, or if I have a lot of things going on my mind ah, so all of us can be affected and uhm, ah, but usually ah, you know, ah, 

00:49:00
Multitasking has an impact 

00:49:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI - most people their problem ah, is, is multitasking too much, not paying attention to things. 

00:49:05
Chapter 4: Memory for Faces Test 

00:49:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And I put this in here just to have, have a little fun ah, and this is gonna lead to somewhere but it turns out that actually ah, learning a name and a face and putting them together is a difficult task. You're taking information that's verbal that you may or may not have ah, a template for, a place for in the brain, but it's a very noble(ph) name it's a different story but you know, most people have known Ed or John or Jack or ah, but in the face it's usually unique and they actually go to different parts of the brain. They get processed differently, they usually get processed in a la, in a language usually in left hemisphere, you know, and, and, and, and visual things on the right hemisphere and they all have to be integrated by the hippocampus and the mediotemporal lobe and then they have to be stored. And, so we, I should take ah, advantage of this fact in our research uhm, but just for fun I want you as the audience to do this. I'm gonna show you some faces and names and just for fun I want you to look at them make it a purely emotional judgment ah, subjective judgment whether the name and face go well together and then try to remember the name and face. Here we go, do with the first one, 

00:50:10
Susan 

00:50:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  second one, 

00:50:15

00:50:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI - third one,

00:50:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI - fourth one, 

00:50:15
Earl 

00:50:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  okay. Whoa! Well, we'll come back to that. (laughing) 

00:50:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:50:25
Chapter 5: Dementia Defined 

00:50:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  I'll shift gears here ah, and let me just give you the def, definition of dementia. We, we, we define dementia as an acquired ah, and substantial decline in, in one of those functions, cognitive, behavior, personality ah, to the point where it's affecting your activities and your functioning. And it's really a syndrome meaning that uhm, you know, people often ask, you know, what's the difference between dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Well, dementia doesn't really specify the cause. We know that Alzheimer's disease is probably the major cause along with vascular disease. And if there's another take home points from, from this, if people usually can only take maybe five important things please take, take away that aging is not sufficient. Ah, and you know as a lead into that it's very natural to, to think well, what, what does happen? What are the kinds(ph) of changes as you age? How does it affect your thinking, and memory, and things like that. And, well let's, let's get into that. I like to give the example of a computer. Uhm, it really turns out that on average as people get older uhm, they have psychomotor slowing which means that there's a decrease in mental perception, processing, and response speed. Your ability to sort of take in information, manipulate it, respond to it uhm, slows down which translates into a, a lower rate of learning per time, okay. And sometimes it also, you know, affects a slower retrieval of information, okay. Uhm, but really the information shouldn't be lost. The information should get in, and should be stored. So, even if you can't recall it that very moment, you know, surely(ph) you should be able to recognize it showing that, that, that the information went in. So as an example I, I say you know if we have a group of 80 year olds on one side of that room and you have a group of 20 year olds on the other side. And if I give everybody ten minutes to learn a whole list of words, on average as a group the 80 year olds are gonna learn less per that ten minutes than the, the 20 year olds. Although it would, individually differences, right? I mean some 80 year old may do much better than some 20 year olds to begin but as a group there, they learn less just because they're slower at acquiring the information, okay. But if I test them again in five minutes, two hours or two days the proportion of what the group learned if they're, if they're actually healthy, non demented 80 year olds and we have normal 20 year old, the proportion of what they learned, in what they later remember and recognize uhm, should be no different between that 80 year olds. So let's say on average they, you know, they learned ten words for, as a group and later on they, you know, at, at, two days later they could recall and, and re, recognized five of them, so 50 percent decline. Uhm, the, the 20 year olds as a group may have learned let's say 14 uhm, in that time or 16 but then you know, two days later they would've recognized or remembered, you know, half of that so it's seven out of 14. So really ah, forgetting, true forgetting is not part of aging and uhm, so we'd call this diminished "fluid intelligence" but it turns out there are some things as we get older that we get better at, vocabulary actually improves. And ah, we, we, we say that crystallized intelligence improves and ah, that goes along with basically greater experience in wisdom resulting in more sophisticated practical and effective strategies uhm, that affect, you know, real-world skills and performance. And the analogy is that, you know every computer that you buy, every, every so often in a few years time, the process gets faster and faster. Uhm, but as you age really, it's true that percep, process are maybe slower but that RAM should still be working and you should be able to write to the hard disk. The hard disk make it nicked here and there but for the most part stu, you know, information should be able to get stored and should be able to get it out. But what happens with aging is that you get more sophisticated programs, software, difference between hardware and software. So you have, the, the young kids in their 20's they maybe ah, super computer with how fast they are ah, but if they don't have the right programs soft, the right, right software on there, you know, they, they may not be even, even do word processing if they don't have, you know, word or something like that. Uhm, so that's kinds of aging uhm, it allows people ah, I mean, well into their 80's, 90's to, to perf, perform very, very well and ah, uhm, ah, and again the take home is that aging is insufficient. Uhm, if people, people's functions are being affected as they're older and it's not because of a physical cause like osteoporosis or, you know, osteoarthritis or something like that if their functions is being affected because their mental capacity have diminished then that's really not normal. Uhm, the good news is that we learned now as opposed to 30 years ago when we didn't really, you know, that, that, that paradigm wasn't true, we understand that the brain actually ah, has plasticity, it means that it retains a lifelong capacity to adapt and reorganize itself. Uhm, and it allows essentially to make new connections, stronger connections, you know, we have, you know, billions of connections, the synapses, billions and billions and ah, and you know, you make more and you make more efficient connections then you may have many different ways of getting to the same information. So let's say a process comes along the dementing process even head trauma or something like that then you may lose some of those pathways of getting into information but if you have more of them, there are many more ways to get at it and that's one of the nice things about sort of ah, ah, understanding that, that experience still induces learning throughout life. So 'd like to say that, you know, it's not true that you can't teach an old dog new tricks but ah, you know, it ju, it just takes longer ah, to teach an old dog ah, new tricks if the dog is not demented. So. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, and I think one part of this is (inaudible) ah, clearer point that the brain is holistic... (crosstalk) 

00:56:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

00:56:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...rather than, we, we break it down and describe this part and that part and so forth... (crosstalk) 

00:56:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right. 

00:56:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...but, its incredible ability of resiliency and ability to store things in different places... (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

00:56:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...or even different sides of the brain sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely, absolutely. And what we see in dementia and Alzheimer's disease, by the time people come to us and they're way down the path what we're seeing is what we're seeing organ failure for the brain. We're seeing some networks in the brain, memory networks, language networks, you know, frontal networks uhm, they've already exhausted many, many of these pathways and they're finally ah, you know, not functioning like they should and it's way far, ah, farther, you know, down, down the line. Uhm, but, I mean that, that, that is good news ah, and, and, so that's why, you know, promoting ah, physical activity, social activity, mental activity ah, is, is very, very important. 

00:57:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Okay. So Alzheimer's disease ah, again I have a little picture here, it shows ah, it's late at night, we have ah, we have a chair with ah, ah, some trousers on it, we have some, looks like some gnomes and one of the gnomes is taking the ah, the key out of a pocket of the ah, trousers and the other one is pointing to put it underneath the ah, ah, in, in the couch and so the car-key gnomes. And the idea is that, you know, this is what happens at, at night that, you know, this is why I have to run home usually three times a week ah, to get something. Ah, so does that mean because of my family history I'm, you know, I'm already developing ah, the Alzheimer's disease? Who knows, ah, however, probably more likely from most of us uhm, if we're forgetful it's because we're multitasking too much. (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Atri you solved my problem and I realized gnomes, that's, (crosstalk) 

00:58:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  It's the gnome that's right. (laughing) 

00:58:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY hiding my keys and glasses. Ah-ha! 

00:58:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  You see what happens is that as, as I'm running out the door I'm thinking about the 50 things that I have to do that day that, 30 of them were on my list from the day before (laughs) and uhm, and I'm not really paying attention, 

00:58:45
Pay attention to what you're doing in the here and now 

00:58:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI - you need attention to remember, and even emotional things, stressors uhm, very, very much as you take up ah, computational processes in the brain and ah, so I'm at the door thinking about some multitasking and I'm not paying enough attention to what I'm doing at that moment. Uhm, so simplifying ones life is a good strategy, uhm, stress reduction is a good strategy, good sleep is good strategy ah, and really focusing on the moments uhm, is good strategy also. 

00:59:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Right. And, and the multi, that you've mentioned multitasking several times in which... (crosstalk) 

00:59:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Yeah. 

00:59:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...reading about a recent study that found that if they just turned TV on and while, and children had to take things to play with... (crosstalk) 

00:59:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uh-huh, uh hmm. 

00:59:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, with the TV on- 

00:59:35
Negative effects of background TV 

00:59:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY - and is something that wasn't interesting to the kids ah, their play level, their interaction with others were, were lower than it would be without the TV on. (crosstalk) 

00:59:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

00:59:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And so even this level of multitasking is apparently damaging and it leads me just to raise the question of ah, our society basically demand multitasking. I look at my ah, granddaughter with, (laughs) with two iPods and a speaker and her cellphone, (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Texting at the same time and yet. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Texting at the same time and so forth, and... (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right, right. 

01:00:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...ah, I'm beginning to wonder really and, and I think I'm student in the class, probably there's something in this class who's working on their computer while they're listening to you. 

01:00:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:00:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, I'm beginning to think that multitasking is really a more serious problem in our society then ah, I, that I used to be proud of my ability to multi task, (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. 

01:00:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY and now, you don't know or don't I have to. (crosstalk) 

01:00:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Just like everything else in life it's about balance, right? 

01:00:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:00:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And knowing when to do what and how much. And ah, in our counter paradigms when we test young, very bright college students, graduate students and we liked to decrease their ah, performance on cognitive test, their memory uhm, their learning abilities. What we do we di, we divide their attention, we get them to do a couple of things at once. And you can just see their performance go like this. So people feel like a lot of time when they're multitasking. They're being, you know, they're getting many, many things done and for very low level stuff that maybe okay. Uhm, but really what they're doing is that, they're processing at a very cursory level and we understand that actually if you wanna really remember something the more deeply you processed the more, the more connections you make between things, the more associations you make uhm, the more, the stronger ah, that memory is going to be... (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So then the, (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and the more effective that learning is going to be. 

01:01:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So basic, of course one of things I focus on in my own writing and research is attending, attending behavior and attention, and so I'm really focusing on attention. I remember in, in college, ah, particularly if I had a class I didn't like I sat in the front row so I didn't dare fall asleep and took, took the notes and tried to hang in with it because I've, I wanted to pass that course and ah, force yourself to focus on the critical issues. 

01:01:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right, right. And, and that's that, it all starts with attention really. Uhm, so ah, so yes, that's, that's one strategy we can all use. Uhm, so as far as Alzheimer's, we've, we've already talked about as the most common ah, dementia, it's really a clinical diagnosis so, again I don't have anything ah, so I really can say, "Oh, gosh. I'm gonna take, you know, the blood level here, and your dementia index just went up." And, and, you know, this is, this is, it gives you the full proof diagnosis and we're very far from, from having anything like that. Uhm, and as I mention the diagnosis does not require tissue, it's really a clinical diagnosis. Uhm, and there are other things I mentioned that, that, that ah, can cause dementia by far, probably Alzheimer's and with Mixed Dementia, Alzheimer's and Vascular-Ischemic ah, brain injury uhm, and impairment are probably the most ah, common uhm, pure Vascular-Ischemic Dementia what we used to call Multi-Infarct demert, Dementia is, is pretty ah, uncommon uhm, by as an isolated cause maybe, you know, five, ten percent at the most. And then there's this, this entity of diffuse Lewy Body Dementia that I'll take just a minute to talk about. Uhm, which is something between Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease where ah, Parkinson's disease is, is, had, has mostly been thought of as a motor condition giving you short tremor, and problems with reflexes and slowness and uhm, and, and, and, and rigidity but it's also, we understand it as a, a very much a, a, a cognitive ah, has a, you know, has cognitive mas, manifestations also. And, and most focused with, with Parkinson's disease eventually will show some symptoms of dementia ah, over time. Mostly in, in doing frontal things again multitasking, attention, working memory, ah, things like that but Lewy Body Dementia is something that, in, in-between, it, it has characteristics of both you know, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in many ways. And uhm, basically people have Parkinsonism but not Parkinson's disease uhm, meaning that they may look a little rigid and they may look, they may have a little ah, falls(ph) or problems with, with, with balance and then there's prominent hallucinations and this is something that's really, really important because as therapists and counselors many of these folks may, may have hallucinations at night for years and years before they have any problems but they don't tell anybody 'coz they actually realize a lot of times that this is not, that not right. Uhm, and then, then their attention and their behavior and their cognitive function waxes and wanes very, very quickly sometimes in a matter of minutes where patients will come in and their wife brings him in and says, you know, this is going on and he'll come in and sit in my office and do very, very well but really is, is really cycling very, very quickly at home. So, it's very under, under, under-diagnosed. Oftentimes people think it's psychiatric or, or, or they think it's Alzheimer's disease and, and rarely though they'll think it's Parkinson's. Then there are things like ah, the focal atrophies like Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia uhm, ah, these are things that oftentimes are very prominent ah, used to also be called Pick's disease uhm, very prominent language or behavior manifestations so I could give an example somebody who, you know, has been ah, upright member of society, you know, very, let's say religious, very ah, sensitive, suddenly becomes very insensitive, does things that are, are really out of character, you know, uhm, will, will go into the bank and, you know, empty, and a bunch of cookies in his pocket and will, you know, you know, be very inappropriate with people physically or, or otherwise, and, and again thinking that dementia doesn't just involve memory. It, it should, you know, you should think about if somebody is, is, is older it, it shouldn't think about "Gosh well, you know what, maybe they're just, you know, they're, they're, they're getting eccentric as they get older." Well, you know, some people are always eccentric and, and, and then it maybe heightened but a lot of odd behaviors in older people should be ah, really investigated. Number one we always think about our call on drugs and everybody, right? But in older people we should always, also think about ah, at the neurodegenerative process. Uhm, a recent example is uhm, and it's, it's public is ah, Pete Domenici, the senator who uhm, ah, who recently ah, said that he's gonna be stepping down in the fall and he's been diagnosed with, with Frontotemporal Dementia. 

01:06:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:06:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, and ah, as you recall ah, last year there were some issues with uhm, they were thinking maybe judgment have been evolved, people made some calls to a U.S. attorney during the uhm, during investigation things like that and again I, I, I used that as a, as an example I think because ah, Senator Domenici has come out and actually he said that this is, this is what I have. Uhm, that people can learn from this, in the sense that if, if people sometimes may, may or, you know, show changes in their behavior or judgment uhm, in an, an older person ah, you may, you may think about ah, other things other than, other than just ah, eccentricity... (crosstalk) 

01:06:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY That's right. 

01:06:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...or, or, or drugs or alcohol. 

01:06:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. 

01:06:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, so that's a broad overview uhm, as I mentioned Alzheimer's in late stage is pretty easy but in, in, in early ah, stages especially in, in highly intelligent functional people it can be very, very difficult uhm, very difficult. And uhm, uhm, I have a cartoon here and ah, again this one shows a living room, it shows a TV and a bunch of ah, looks like pillows from the couch and an older woman is, is standing next to the, next to these pillows that are put in and sort of a ah, shape of a fort almost and looks like an older person sitting actually in the fort like the kids play, you know, and, and like my kids play in living room for example. And the woman saying to the man, says, " Well, you can just rebuild the fort later Harold, Fritz(ph) and Shirley are coming over, I'll need the cushions." So, you know, this type of behavior I mean if this was the you know, the ah, you know, suddenly ah, I, I wanna highlight that, that, you know, this odd behavior or this withdrawal uhm, ah, this, you know, sometimes ah, can be due to something else than, than just clinical depression and that's something that's very, very important for counselor and therapist to know that, I remember medical school, you know, I, we were trained not to miss ah, depression. And uhm, to understand what the, you know, what, what are the symptoms of anxiety, what are the symptoms of depression not to, not to miss that. And they usually teaches about what, what they called pseudodementia that an older patients sometimes uhm, really they may act confused and demented but really they're just clinically depressed. (crosstalk) 

01:08:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:08:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And, and really I would say if you think about that think about really also pseudo-depression that's really not, really clinical depression that it really could be apathy or withdrawal or lack of initiative and motivation that, that, that happens to, to happen very, very early in many, many patients with Alzheimer's disease usually years before the diagnosis is is made. And here's, here's, here's some data to show that, (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, so clinically ah, when you have an older person with depression ah, bring out the Alzheimer's checklist and... (crosstalk) 

01:09:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI That's right. 

01:09:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...talk to the family and make sure that they seek(ph) with another referral to, a medical referral maybe necessary. 

01:09:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Absolutely, absolutely. And talk, you, you nailed, nailed it talk to the family, get collateral history, and, and, and have it on your radar that if there's anxiety and depression in older person then, uhm, yes you're gonna, you're, you're gonna address that but you're also going to do a, a little review of systems and check for, for a potential dementia. Uhm, uhm, so that's, that's, that's quite important. Uhm, ah, and here's another, another one. It says, "Well, Emily is out like a light, just can't resist pulling that little sun of yours, can you Earl?" And he says, you know, there's Earl sitting on a ah, in the living room and he's had this thing where his head's puffing off, he's got, you know, some kind of a, a dummy there and he's clearly, you know, sort of a uhm, maybe a, being a prankster ah, in an appropriate way, and so again I, I say that of, of those with high risk of dementia not all this inhibited behavior can be rationalized it's, it's people being eccentric. So again... (crosstalk) 

01:10:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

01:10:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...think about your checklist. 

01:10:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:10:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Yeah. 

01:10:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Unusual behavior, blowing up ah, ah, being extra frightened, any number of things that are different from the norm. (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Very different. Change that's the most important thing. (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Change. 

01:10:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Everything I say is changed. Think about when, when people say, "Oh, I don't remember this." Well, guess what maybe they never re, remembered names. I mean maybe that's not just a difference for them in their life, you know, but when you are looking at things it's really the change that's important. It's, (crosstalk) 

01:10:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. 

01:10:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI you know, and that's what you have, have to tease out. And, and that's why you know, getting the perspective of the patient is important but also getting collateral history is very important. (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, like good with numbers then suddenly he can't... (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Can't. 

01:10:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...or rationally can't handle a checkbook. 

01:10:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct, all the, the, ah, exactly. And uhm, and you know the perception is that patients don't always perceive it sometimes they perceived it early themselves and, and, and they may get more anxious about it. But as time goes on a lot of people don't perceive that they have a problem. I mean you know, the brain certainly is the same organ that perceives the environment and perceives inter, mind(ph) and internal states too. So ah, they may not be aware that they don't remember or they don't, they're having problems and ah, ah, he may not be as concerned about it and so they, you know, you need to have that checklist. 

01:11:15
Chapter 6: Basic Dementia Work-up 

01:11:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  So, the basic work-up that we, we suggest is, you know, anybody probably in, you know, probably 65, 70 ah, one can do a, do a screening just in a very simple ah, conversation. Uhm, so you know, well, you know ah, aging is a risk factor and, you know, on how do you feel your memory is, you know, is it as good as it's always been for, you know, recent events, conversations, names? Not what happened 34 years ago. You know I have patients coming in and give and they have, relatively advanced Alzheimer's disease and dementia. And they can recite poems and, you know, of events 34 years ago really well but they, they don't know what they did yesterday morning. And because again, the systems that are involved early uhm, are, are for new learning, and new memory, recent advance, short term. The things from years ago are very well rehearsed and they're stored in different parts of the brain that are affected ah, ah, much later. Ah, any, you know, you should ask people, are you, have difficulty recalling words or names. Uhm, how about doing task? Task you've commonly, easily done in past like, you know, are they taking much longer to do or to organize like doing their taxes, cooking large meals during holidays, having to resort a lot more to recipes the way you didn't before. Again, this doesn't label somebody as having dementia but, you know, it's, it's part of a, uhm, ah, you know, your clues about what maybe going on and that, that, you know, the red flag should go up that there, there maybe something going on that requires more attention. And ah, I put this here, this is ah, this is called the AD8 and it's, it's available, uhm, uhm, the senior author is John Morris uhm, in Saint Louis at, at, ah, Washington University and James Galvin is, is, is the first author. It's a brief informant interview to detect dementia. The nice thing about this is, it's very simple, it could be sent actually home for the ah, family members to do ah, and actually even the patient can do it, too. And, and really what it does is, it asks a series of eight questions and uhm, as you can see ah, mostly it says, you know, remember, it says a 'Yes, change,' indicates that there is been a changed in the last several years caused by cognitive, thinking and memory problems. So, one is not attributing cause, that's the most important thing, not to attribute cause because uhm, basically a lot of people will, will say things like, well, you know, yes, he doesn't, you know, he's less interested in hobbies and activity, but you know he's retired. Or, you know, yes, it's because, he has arthritis or yes, because so and so died. Uhm, people will always attribute cause and the nice thing about this is that you're asked to say whether there's been a change or not but really not to attribute the cause. And the questions are, are there problems with judgments, making decisions, bad, making bad financial decisions, ah, loosing interest, repeating the same stories, ah, having trouble learning new, new things that using new tools, forgetting the correct month or year, uhm, you know, ah, you know, trouble handling complicated financial affairs, like balancing their checkbook, trouble remembering appointments, and really daily problems with thinking or memory. And if way two or more of those are positive as, as, as a 'Yes, change' then uhm, you know, that person is quite high risk ah, for, for having a, a dementia uhm, so, 85 percent or more. Uhm, and so, you know, it's appropriate to, to look further and, and, to have a referral like that. 

01:14:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY But what about those who can't figure out HDTV? 

01:14:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI (laughing) Ah, you get, maybe you, maybe you get one point for that but ah, (laughing) that's not gonna be two points. You know, people often ask me wha, what, what, you know, if you wanna do something to just to do a quick screen, what should we do? So, so, I would say, certainly uhm, uhm, you should ask him about, you know, the date, time, and, and where, where you are at that point. And as you get to know more and more, you become a, a more, a tougher grader. Uhm, and you won't that, let things slide as much because you'll say to yourself, "Oh, gosh! You know, well, it's true I, I, I don't remember sometimes what date is and what the correct date." But guess what, if they came to see you as a clinician, as a therapist, as a counselor, at some point in time, they knew the date and the time to show up and they knew where to go. And so, the, the, the sort of the excuse or the, the rationalization, the reason of, "Oh, you know, I'm retired, I don't keep track of those things." It shouldn't really apply as much. I'm not saying, just brand somebody demented because they don't, you now, remember the, the exact dates. But again, you take that as, as one components of a clue that there maybe something going on. (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:16:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And uhm, so, so, you, you know, you may use uhm, some of those clues and ah, some of those questions. And then usually I would say, give them something to remember. You give them a, a name and address like from that blessed-dementia scale. So I usually tell people to remember rep, and I said, "Repeat after me. John Brown." "John Brown." "42 West Street." "42 West Street." "Cambridge." And I say that to them three times. I really want them to remember that. So, three times they repeat this to me. I say, "Well, remember that, and my job is to then, distract you." So, immediately from that, I move on to doing something that involves ah, working memory so they're not rehearsing. So, I tell them, "Well, please, tell me the, the, the months that you are backwards." And you can actually be fairly advanced in Alzheimer's disease and Dementia and do thing, be able to do things like the months or years backwards, counting from twenty down to one, subtracting seven from a hundred and going back, subtracting three from twenty and going back, continue to do that. And again some of those are educationally ah, based, you know, spelling the world backwards, things like that, uhm, ah, because early on, the front parts of the brain and, and the parts that are, that are manipulating uhm, you know, working memory aren't usually ah, affected us much. If you don't like the name and address, you can make something else, like you know, I can also make up things like red ball, mailman, sunrise, and honesty. And in that list, you know, as you notice from red ball, mailman, sunrise, honesty, I went from something that was apparent associate that you can hang on to two things of, you know, the red or the ball and relatively concrete, relatively high frequency and daily use to things that are much more abstract like sunrise and honesty, and making it more difficult. And, and, and again uhm, you wanna give them ah, these items and then distract them, use, use some sort of a uhm, a task like as I mentioned here months backwards worlds, world backwards. And again, also drawing your clock and uhm, drawing a clock is very interesting it's not in test for memory but it's a very good test actually for vision and spatial function, planning uhm, and understanding directions. So, and, and it's the clock hands(ph) that should be, has to be done this way. I usually say, "Here's a piece of paper. Please draw, draw a large round clock face and put the numbers on it." And uhm, and then after they do that, I say, "Okay, now, just like this. Draw in the hands of the clock to show ten minutes past eleven," just like that, ten minutes past eleven. Then actually, requires people to think, ten minutes past eleven, that the small hand has to be just past uhm, ah, eleven and the, and the longer hand has to be just, you know, a, a, at two. And tsk, when they're doing this, I'm looking to see as they're drawing the clock, how are they spacing the numbers. Is the spacing off? Uhm, do they have to restart again? And as you know more and more, you become a more difficult grader for this because most of us, I mean, we know, all of us, clocks are something's that we, we, we grow up with, so that's not difficult. Uhm, but it's a very, very sensitive task for, for, for the front parts of the brain. They are often times affected in vascular changes and I've given this challenge to probably thousands of primary care doctors and I say, if you do this, or clinicians, in your next 100 consecutive 70 year olds and older, that you have no idea, you don't suspect that although they have any kind of dementia or any problems. And if your mouth does not just fall wide open of at least one of them that has a lot of problems on, on doing this task that you, you would never suspected, then I will, tell me about it, show me your data that it's consecutive and ah, I'll, I'll ah, I'll, I, either come and take you to a, to a dinner and you place your choice (laughs) or I'll send you the money but I can tell you that, that, that uhm, a lot of people have, have, have told that, that ah, it's amazing how sensitive it is for, for, for early things even though it, it sounds, sounds simple. And guess what, you've done something like that, you can do a few other things if you like but by this time, it's ah, and you can go on and, and have a conversation about how they're feeling and their mood, and, and ah, uhm, and, and ah, then, what happens is that ah, I usually have a question for folks and, and the most common memory problem in a clinician's office is what? It's actually the clinician forgetting to remember, you know, to ask those questions so, (laughing) 

01:20:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:20:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  so, if, if the person leaves and say is that, you know, "Don't you want me to, you know, tell me those, those, that address again?" Then, then probably they're doing okay. Uhm, but remember that, to ask them ah, tho, those, those questions again. Uhm, and guess what if they, if they forget one, it's okay. (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So the delayed recall... (crosstalk) 

01:20:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Comes after. 

01:20:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...come bri, all(ph) you've done all of that. 

01:20:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Well, I, I have some suggestions that you could do, you could be a heck(ph) or give him ah, nor do a complex figure or have him name things, you know, that are, that are less ah, less frequent, you know, and uhm, you can, you can ask them, you know, what is this? You know, thumb, nail, cuticle, uhm, so very easy wa, you know, watch, band, clasp, uhm, and, you know, sometimes as they have troubled, you know, with retrieving the words they'll, they'll say, "Yeah." They'll describe it. They can't, can't come up with the word. Again, you're not branding them as demented but, you know, it's again another clue and, you know, if they're really missing some things on that, on that name and, and, and address, or in those items. You know, if they're missing one that's okay. If they're starting to miss two or three of those things then, you know, something maybe going on and it still could be attention but, you know. So, that's a very simple sort of ah, a review that you can do uhm, and then, you know, in, in the clinic, we, we send for some blood work, we oftentimes look at, things like Vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function and, you know. Ah, many of this things really are not gonna cause the dementia but there are common(ph) in older, older ah, patients and they can contribute to the symptoms and they're treatable. Uhm, and then oftentimes we'll, we'll do one, one imaging, a study and usually we do an MRI. And, uhm, and, and we look for, for shrinking (crosstalk) 

01:22:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I hope(ph) you better say what is an MRI. 

01:22:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Hah! An MRI ah, basically Magnes, Magnetic Resonance uhm, Imaging uhm, does not actually involve ah, any exposure to radiation, you go into this magnetic fields, so, you know if you don't, you know, ah, if you have that pacemaker that you can go in there. If you don't shut(ph) off(ph) your eye you can't go, 'coz the most people can't go in there, there's a checklist. Uhm, and, and basically it, it provides us very nice images of structure of the brain. It doesn't tell us how things are functioning ah, PET scan maybe able to do them. We'll talk about Positron Emission Tomography there but it's a way for us to get some clues to make su, to see to what degree uhm, has there been vascular changes in the brain. We have some clues and I'll show some pictures of that. Is there, are there mini strokes that the patient has been having. There are some that we, that, that people didn't know about and that is not that uncommon. So then with those folks, you wanna be very uhm, aggressive about treating their vascular risk factors, their blood pressure, their glucose, ah, their lipids. I'm getting amount of, of aspirin if they, they have no problems of bleeding. Ah, having them to smo, stop smoking, you know promoting uhm, you know, exercise and other kinds of health uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Now, this is a relatively new system. Is it available throughout the country now or is it uhm, is there... (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI MRI's are uhm, are widely available... (crosstalk) 

01:23:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...proof. 

01:23:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  and they're actually as a, as a part of a ah, ah, work out for memory loss or dementia and ah, the American Academy Neurology Guidelines say that the imaging study is appropriate. Uhm, Cat Scan or MRI but ah, you know, most of us uhm, will endorse getting an MRI because of the uhm, tsk, ah, better ability to, to look at structure uhm, and also to see if a vascular changes have occurred. 

01:24:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And will be covered by Medicaid and by (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:24:04
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  It is covered by all the insurance by Medicaid, it's an appropriate indication for... (crosstalk) 

01:24:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

01:24:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...for somebody had been complaining their memory problems or language or any kind of dementia. 

01:24:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY This is not an issue for a counselor but this thing... (crosstalk) 

01:24:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Correct. 

01:24:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...is good for a counselor to understand. 

01:24:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And it's not invasive. It's not that they're going... (crosstalk) 

01:24:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY No. 

01:24:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...to, you know, uhm, you know, take tissue from them or, you know. Uhm, so, you know, you'd ask what(ph) we're getting closer to seeing these plaques and tangles. And ah, we don't see direct evidence completely yet except on, on the research protocols that we, we can talk about. But the indirect evi, evidence that we see are things like this, shrinkage of the brain. So, here on the left, we have uhm, a brain ah, at autopsy that that has been cut in a coronal way. So, uhm, ah, this is the mid-section and uhm, you can see on the right, there's a brain that's severely atrophied, shrunken. And with aging, we understand that, that the brain for most folks will shrink some ah, but that is very, very ah, distinct in this case and we can get clues of this by looking at MRI's. For example, the red areas here that I've marked in a quote, unquote normal brain versus a (clears throat) moderately athrophied ah, hippocampus. So, this is really the mediotemporal area here, that area we talked about that was sort of ram(ph) shaped in many ways of the brain ah, the integrator ah, of new information tsk, and uhm, and, you know, clinicians and radiologists can take a look and get a sense of what maybe out of, you know, atrophy that is out of proportion to the rest of the brain or for age. Again, it does not, an MRI does not diagnose Alzheimer's disease. It's a clinical diagnoses including history from family members, to patient, doing the test, uhm, looking at this things, and if things are congruent then, then, one can give that clinical diagnoses. Tsk, uhm, here again shows an MRI of a healthy older adult and someone with Alzheimer's disease. And you can see here for example uhm, the gray stuff is, is the, the brain parenchyma and you can see in the top picture, ah, that's an axil view, we can actually see a cut, the, the eyes, you could see the eyes and the nose uhm, and all the black stuff is really fluid inside the brain. And when the brain shrinks uhm, well, there's nothing else to replace it but fluid and so, you can see in this case, in Alzheimer's case, it's much more of this black stuff which is really fluid, that's replacing troubled brain. Uhm, tsk, and, and here's, here's a picture again coronally showing, going from that a patient who is ah, control subject, he was healthy at that time uhm, is going normally at ah, you know, doing Neuropsychological testing, IQ testing, concept testing, memory testing, uhm, and as time goes on stage of mild cognitive impairment have, actually Alzheimer's disease, you can see how much the black fluid's bases increase. And particularly, this is the hippocampus area here and this the mediotemporal lobe right there. And you can look at this water way here, the dark part, it's called a ventricle and you can see how big that is here by this stage. And uhm, ah, and also everywhere else the cortex, the gray matter has shrunk. So again, congruent ah, you know, evidence that, that this is out of proportion. Here is another MRI and in this MRI, you notice all this white stuff. Well, you see the normal grape brain parenchyma, this white stuff is basically damage to the, the myelin sheath, this is a, this the a basically a fat layer that basically covers all the process of our neurons, that a, al, allows the electro impulses to go very quickly. (crosstalk) 

01:28:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY No. 

01:28:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Without it and when it's damaged, you know, communication between brain cells slows down. And, and because of years and years of basically micro vessel disease, problems with local regulation of the vessels in the brain because of smoking, high blood pressure, glucose, lipids, uhm, we can see signs of this damage and it's, it's solitude(ph) to most people in their 60s and 70s have a little bit, but this, this is an illustration of a fair bet. And all things being equal the more you have ah, the worst that counter function is going to be, you know, and that's why that's(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:28:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY But how can this be different from multiple sclerosis, MS? 

01:28:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI So that's a very, very good question uhm, so MS also affects uhm, uhm, the white matter and the, the, this myelin sheath. Uhm, and so, what we do is we look for the pattern and we also uhm, ah, you know, MS tends to be ah, a condition that affects much younger people ah, as opposed to older people. It's, it's less common really for people in their 70s or 80s to develop multiple sclerosis. And the plaques that, that, again they called those MS plaques which we again, sorry about the terminology, but ah, the damage that occurs there happens very characteristically and we have additional tests uhm, with MRI's and other things to look for those and to see that, that there is clear inflammation going on, that this is a very acute inflammatory effect as opposed to the blood vessels. Uhm, here, here is another thing that can happen that MRI's can help with, here's a study that, that we did a few years ago, uhm, unbeknownst to us, uhm, ah, basically we took people who came on our Memory Disorders Unit here and we took away anybody who had a history of any kind of stroke or have blood thinners, and we'll just look to them in a special MRI sequence and we looked for signs of old blood. So, these blacks dots here are basically old hemorrhages here and the blood is gone 'coz the, 'coz it gets resolved after time. What's left over is the iron from the red blood cell, the hemosiderin. And it left, leaves a little ar, artifact that we can pick up and this are folks that, that basically came in with the complaints, cardio complaint or memory complaint, and lo and behold between 15 to 20 percent of them have microhemorrhages in their brain, who've had in the past. And uhm, uhm, in our case, it was 15 percent and we showed ah, sorry about the pun, it's a no brainer, that the more you have, the more it actually affects your cognitive function and increases your risk factors for, for dementia. Uhm, but in other studies that have been published since uhm, you know, that percentage maybe as, as high as uhm, 20 percent of people. And that, that's something that's important because ag, again when you, you, (inaudible ) remem, remember things by associating with them and very well known person with this problem was Ariel Sharon ah, of Israel, who had a stroke and ah, the stroke wasn't by, because of this, uhm, they thought he had a low clot that went through the heart and they give him blood thinners, the doctors did. And unfortunately, people who, who bleed with microhemorrhages are probably gonna bleed again. And when their blood's made thin, they may bleed even more. So unfortunately, the day before he, they were gonna close this little hole in his heart, he had a massive hemorrhage. And what really did the man was that hemorrhage, uhm, so, this is, this is why it's also important for us to, to understand these things. Uhm, ah, because action may cha, may change management in some folks. And uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:31:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY This is a (inaudible ) 

01:31:47
DR. ALIREZA ATRI and, and Ariel Sharon had this, so it turns out that when they had done the MRI before they'd seen evidence for many, many of this microhemorrhages in his past. (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Ah, this is original work, discovery that you made then, I gather? 

01:31:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, this is a paper, yes, that we, that we published a few years ago that had not been done before and uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:32:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Wow. 

01:32:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI that's not the main thrust to my research but uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:32:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Do that with your little finger while you're doing the other things, (crosstalk) 

01:32:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Well, no, no, no. 

01:32:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY it still makes this(ph) at (inaudible ) little finger I see it.(crosstalk) 

01:32:12
DR. ALIREZA ATRI No, no, I thought(ph) it's ah, (laughs) ah, it's, it's, it's more sort of uhm, ah, that the more we understand this interplay between vascular changes in Alzheimer's disease, I think we're, we're better off. It turns out that this is an important issue in clinical trials now also, that may, may in, increased ah, hemorrhages. Some of the, some of the therapies that we're using experimentally to draw amyloid out of the brain may put us at more increased ah, risk for hemorrhages. So, protocols like this are now have been put into the(ph) clinical trials. To, (crosstalk) 

01:32:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, really? 

01:32:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI to, to, to catch people in the clinical trials that may have more hemorrhages because of it. So, 

01:32:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Oh. 

01:32:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI in that sense uhm, I think that's good. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:32:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY You know, it's kind of a major contribution... (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY But, (crosstalk) 

01:32:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY ...with the little finger. 

01:32:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI but, no, but ah, but, you know, going back again to, to, to, to Ariel Sharon, a lot of people in the literature ah, have, have speculated ah, about uhm, whether a change in his behavior over the few, last few years, may have had to do with, with, with this. Again, that's all speculation but people who thought about whether that's, that's possible because, you know, he was a public, accumulating microhemorrhages uhm, while, while he was ah, you know, uhm, ah, still in office. So, uhm, I don't have a, it's actually if you go on in the Internet you can find a fair bit about this. So, I have another slide that actually talks about this in the literature and all the stuff that's published since about this. 

01:33:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY That makes you want to have an MRI of all our presidential candidates. 

01:33:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Well, I'll, I'll get to that, interesting enough. (laughs) I'm, I'm, I believe that there should not be, I think that, that age should not restrict anything. I mean, I think people should in many ways, ignore their age and go, go, go about ah, their business li, living well and age should not preclude anybody from doing anything. Uhm, I think competence is issue but I think one needs to, at the highest offices, ah, needs to, needs to just like, you know, having a, a physical checkup should have very, very good mental checkups and kind of health checkups. I mean there's a reason why, for example uhm, ah, pilots are, are not allowed to actually fly commer, commercial airliners after a certain age because the reaction time, the psychomotor is slowing, the reaction times fall, right? And again, I think that, that should be a matter of competence as opposed to ah, strict age limit but, but it's, it, it, I think it's ironic a little bit that it's okay, (laughing) there ail, age limits for that but there's, there's nothing else at, at the higher offices. 

01:34:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Those are people making all(ph) our life decisions? 

01:34:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. 

01:34:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:34:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct, and we'll talk actually about President Reagan. I actually bring that up when, when we talk about uhm, (crosstalk) 

01:34:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:34:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI about how, how people can have Alzheimer's disease in the brain. Even to show, show symptoms and, and still function at, at certain levels and, and maybe even go under the radar of, of many people. So, I had mentioned that the Positron Emission Tomography, the PET, uhm, that is something actually also that it's available now even clinically in a cer, certain cases where frontotemporal Lewy(ph) body(ph) generation is suspected, actually Medicare and insurance pays for this type of test. Uhm, we shouldn't do this on everybody, we suspect have Alzheimer's disease. It's expensive task, it requires a little bit of uhm, actually ah, radio activity. Uhm, and basically what, what they do is they, they tag a glucose molecule and everywhere that's red is basically the cortex and it shows that it, it has appropriate ah, and symmetric ah, uptake of this glucose, which means blood flow is good and, you know, nerve cells and neurons are using energy and there, you know, and, and therefore that's appropriate. But in early Alzheimer's disease, we see patterns that are different, in the parietal lobes, in the temporal lobes, we find the color drop out here. So, they're not hot red anymore, they start to be more of this yellowish or even blue. And again, this doesn't, not, no test that we have is a hundred percent sensitive or specific, in the sense that most of the tests we have are about 85 to 90 percent, you know, cross sectionally ah, ah, sensitive and specific because again, there's such an overlap between, between, between different people. And uhm, overtime though uhm, you know, we can probably separate this populations and uhm, so this is something that, that occasionally, you know, we'll do, we do a lot of this in the research realm but occasionally I'll, I'll do this a few times a year, especially in people who are young, uhm, you know, ah, late 40s, early 50s with Alzheimer's disease, uhm, to make sure that, that nothing else. Uhm, the other thing that, that we do nowadays uhm, you know, in, in some people again the younger people oftentimes are if, if ah, the diagnosis is, is unsure again ah, we do a PET and we may also get spinal fluid. And actually look for the ratio of this toxic amyloid and the tau proteins. And again, somewhere between 85 to 90 per, 90 percent or so spen, sensitivity and specificity. Ah, so again, it gives a another clue along with the MRI with the testing, with the blood work, with the PET scan in difficult cases, unusual cases, young, young people uhm, so we can make the diagnosis, and people can move on to clinical trials if they want to, for example. 

01:37:35
Chapter 7: FDA Approved Treatments for AD 

01:37:35
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, a, a very quick note about ah, pharmacological treatments, I have a, ah, slide here again. We have a whole bunch of people with red coats, around someone on the bed, there's ah, IV, and the patient doesn't look so good but they're kinda pointing and they're all laughing at him like this. And it says, "Testing with the laughter is the best medicine." So ah, you know, our, our human, ah, research ah, board wouldn't approve of this, this test and, and, ah, I'd like to say that our treatments now are, are better than that. Uhm, so over the last uhm, decade or so, we have ah, some medications, three of them are in a class chol, Cholinesterase inhibitors. Basically, what they're doing is they're boosting the level of acetylcholine which primes a lot of ah, different neurons in the brain uhm, and is involved with attention and arousal and even memory. Uhm, and we know the levels of that chemical drop as there's, ah, this destruction of, of the brain. And what does this medicines do, they try to uhm, decrease the amount of breakdown with that chemical on the brain, boosting the level that's available uhm, ah, and then there's another medication that's uhm, available for the later stages and moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease that works on the glutamate pathway which is again another ah, neuron chemical on the brain, that's very much involve with ah, memory and learning. Uhm, and ah, the bottom line is that, is that overtime, people will usually get on uhm, you know, one medicine and then a combination of the medications. And ah, really I have a slide here that I made myself that, that shows that ah, if you have efficacy trials, the ones that ah, you know, pharmaceutical companies do the show that their medicines have, have uhm, you know, some efficacy and, and to understand some of the safety issues. Ah, for groups of patients, whether you're measuring some cognitive measure, performance on memory test or function, or behavior. And the time for this, for this studies are usually limited six months or twelve months but they're, they're well designed, they're randomized, they're double blinded, they're placebo controlled. Usually for a group, what you get, you get the separation between those on placebo and those who have been on a drug ah, for the group. Now, the in, for individual patients this may completely vary and, you know, you can't predict for an individual level but the bottom line is that, is that uhm, uhm, you know, the, the, the best evidence now is that they have effects that let, let, that even go on beyond this but you see for the most part, the groups will decline and the expectation really isn't that people are gonna get much better. It's really to slow down the decline of the symptoms. And uhm, and uhm, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll sort of ah, people ask me, how do you, how do you identify the transition from mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and I have this ah, slide again and, and it's a little ah, spider that's sitting there on a, on a leaf and looking at, at, at ah, the web, and the web is, is really not constructed very well. And ah, and, and, and in, in wonderments the, the spider saying, "Whoa, that can't be right." And, and I think that's a good analogy in some ways. Uhm, where people ah, are doing something that is very important to their functioning, that they've done for a long time, they're not just quite doing it right anymore. And that's really affecting their function, I think that's, you know, you're, you're probably transitioning from, from, from, you know, you know, on the stages of mild to moderate. Ah, (crosstalk) 

01:41:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm. The spider, the normal spider produces the beautiful web and I, I, and I see here just ah, partial good web and then a kind of a random type of collection and ah, (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right, right. 

01:41:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I can imagine ah, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:41:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  And again. 

01:41:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I, I can't help but think of ah, a very prominent psychologist that probably the most people I'd admire the most and really clear. And yet, he eventually died of Alzheimer's and the, the transition that you present here on that slide really well, actually I guess you(ph) could say that it affects me. It's, it's, it's difficult. 

01:41:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Yup. Right. Yup, and, and, you know, again uhm, it happens overtime and uhm, people can still produce very good work at times and, you know, this trends can be very preserved at times but it become, the fluctuations and the reserve, and the variability in the product becomes much more(ph). The work product. 

01:42:15
Chapter 8: A Practical Guide to Care and Treatment (i.e.,"What I Do and Why") 

01:42:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Ah, this is just a practical guide of what I do and why. Uhm, and my approach really is, even though I'm a cognitive neurologist, I approach things more like a geriatrician. I, I look at improving quality of life by maximizing function and really minimizing ah, behavioral problems. And really, the first thing I do is to look at uhm, this thing called Beers List which is available uhm, B-E-R-S. Uhm, it's published every few years uhm, and, I, I think it's Annals of Internal Medicine and these are the medications that are uhm, should be used with(ph) caution to elderly patients. Oftentimes, they have anticholinergic effects, so, decreasing or blocking that ah, that, that ah, chemical on the brain, acetylcholine. And people can accumulate medications overtime and elderly people do oftentimes and nobody really ah, you know, they just add the medications but nobody sets back to say, " Gosh! Do we need this things," and, you know, ah, can we simplify and take them off. Ah, ah, it could be that they, they accumulate five different medicines, each one with small amounts of, of anticholinergic properties. Or people will take for example uhm, ah, medications to go to bed at night, not realizing that they have a diphenhydramine in it, Benadryl. So, they take Tylenol PM for example, nothing against Tylenol PM it's just that the Benadryl part of it that is sedating can also cause major problems for, for people who are kind of (inaudible ) susceptible. So, you know, and again, I, I just go by the best clinical evidence and for me, that, you know, randomize double binucleate(ph) controlled, ah, placebo controlled studies, if you have them. Otherwise, you look at observational studies and things like that. But every intervention, whether it's ah, you know, talking to somebody, or counseling them, that's an innervate intervention. Uhm, I, I look at with the, with the eye of, the eyes of sort of ah, safety first. And ah, so primum non nocere, above all do no harm, the first tenet of medical ethics. And then I think about tolerability, how is this gonna affect them uhm, and everything I do is low, slowly. Uhm, you know, I, I, the, the, the bottom line is to start doing something uhm, but if you gonna give medications or doing things like that, then you have to start a low and go slowly because I can tell you that, they may not remember uhm, if they had, you know, what they have for breakfast in the morning, but if Dr. Atri makes them sick they'll remember that. And that, that affects the therapeutic alliance and whether, you know, and their trust and wanting to do things with me again and uhm, and uhm, I only change one thing at a time because I'm not smart enough to know if one thing is, you know, giving the, the side effect, what's giving the effect. Uhm, I really try to promote, you know, healthy practices, nutrition, physical exercise, mental activities, social engagement, sleep hygiene, sleep is very, very, very important memory consolidation. Uhm, you know, people have, may have, ostrup, obstructive sleep apnea and not know it, a lot of snoring at night. Ah, where at periods where they're not getting good oxygen. And ah, and the blood vessels are constricting because of high, high carbon dioxide ah, and also stress reduction. Long term stress affects ah, the hippocampus and parts of the brain, we're not, we were not built to have long term stress. So, you know, if this saber-toothed tiger came and we need to get that pump of adrenaline and get the cursorial(ph) up, that, that allows to do things and get the cardiovascular response, that was good. But to have that as a prolonged effects in our culture now. Uhm, that causes other severe problems including, we understand, you know, decreasing neurogenesis, new nerves, ah, new, new synapses and nerves being, being made in the hippocampus and, and uhm, so, so that's very important. 

01:46:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. And, and the thing is that ah, part of our series is ah, I think one of things that counselors and therapists really can do is to give them a lot more attention to assessment of stress and stress management. In fact, in our series of probably now for videos at least at this point ah, we have ah, major one on stress management. And as part of the treatment process ah, Dr. Ali, ah Dr. Atri ah, the therapist spends about 10 minutes since the beginning interview explaining what happens to the brain during stress and the rest of the body. 

01:46:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. Correct. 

01:46:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, stress management is really a central ah, in the treatment. And I think your quality of life. But go ahead (crosstalk) 

01:46:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

01:46:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I'm sorry. 

01:46:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. No, no, that, that's, that's, that's... (crosstalk) 

01:46:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I had to hit that point, really. (crosstalk) 

01:46:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...that's a very important point actually to, to take home. And also supporting and promoting the emotional health of a patient and the caregivers, it's, it's extremely important in, and really the quality of life and where they end up. Uhm, and, it, it, affects, you know, their health, actually it's a public health issue in many ways. Uhm, and ah, and also economically what happens in, in the future, as far as what medications they go on or not and when they go into a nursing home(ph). And I always try to bring it back to medical ethics, we will talk about at the end a little bit. Really what I do Professor Ivey, is not ah, it's not rocket science that, you know, the (inaudible ) is not brain surgery. Uhm, what I do is educate and try to educate patient and family members, and this can be done by anybody who's knowledgeable, who cares enough about this. And so, it can be extremely done very, very well by, by therapists and counselors and I like to you know, educate them about Alzheimer's disease uhm, about, you know, what to expect, what, what, what are the different options for therapy, what are the expectation. Ah, oftentimes we refer them to the Alzheimer's Association site both on, on the web and also their pamphlets and their help lines. Uhm, and uhm, that really, really makes a difference in people's lives. As far as the medications ah, I, I usually explain to them that they you know ah, the idea really is uhm, ah, decreasing a decline overtime and only, you know 15, 10-15 percent of people after six months do the family member say really, "Gosh you know there, there, they're, they're, they're doing things that they didn't do before, better" I mean they've gone back, we've taken the clock back. Uhm, uhm, and some measure of function, behavior ah, you know constant measure or, or, or, or just a gist of what's goin' on. Ah, about 50 percent stay about the same over six months to a year and about you know 20-30 percent or so decline over that initial period. Now, if you follow those folks long term uhm, that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't plateau uhm, there have been studies they've, they've done where the fo, fo, the folks that decline, they took 'em off the medications. They decline even faster, they put them on, they actually slow the decline again. So, ah, sometimes again ah, the benefits aren't that visible because the effect sizes are small. They're very modest for the most part, from those people as a group. Uhm, and the other things, is that, is that if you put people on, on the combination therapies early enough, you sort of decrease a likelihood of the emergence of the frequency and severity of, of behavioral disturbances that we expect will emerge overtime like delusions or paranoia, wandering, agitation, reversal of nights ah, night and day sleep. And, you know when, when, when in a multi sort of ah, disciplinary way and, and ah, if you approach things with educatin' the family members as far as what to do when, when people are agitated ah, at nights. How do you redirect them. How do you reassure them. Uhm, uhm, and ah, you know what to watch out for during the day as far as engaging in a certain way so they're not sitting there and falling asleep during the day and then getting up at night and be coming agitated. Uhm, all of these things actually will ah, will help in preventing people reaching for antipsychotics later on which we know carry ah, risks in the elderly population. Those risk have to be balanced with you know the risk and also them getting hurt going outside breaking a hip ah, hurting somebody else by being agitated but the, the, they're not insignificant risk of actually ah, that they carry. And you, you know we can sedate people with this antipyshotics to buy basically some behavioral management... (crosstalk) 

01:50:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

01:50:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...but we then sacrifice oftentimes cognition, function and even movement. So, so I, I, I can't stress that enough uhm, and I, I talk about it but there's no cure and that I explain to, and then I expect decline over, over a year despite treatment and that I can't predict the rate, nobody can do that. Uhm, I tell them about President Reagan when I talked about you know the President being ah, President till 1989 and by '94 ah, having difficulty with ah, with ah, you know recognizing family members uhm, and, and now understandin' that in the last years of his office ah, that he was affected. And ah, (crosstalk) 

01:51:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY Had difficulty in recognizing family members while he is still President? 

01:51:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI No, later on. (crosstalk) 

01:51:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY No, later on. Okay. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:51:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Later on, by '94. But, but the point is that, that he didn't, this didn't happen overnight. And uhm, and ah, you know ah, and, and, and Reagan you know was ah, you know President Reagan didn't pass, pass away until few years ago, years ago but it just again goes to show that people with high social intelligence and President Reagan was somebody who, who make connections with folks and had, had very high social intelligence uhm, can really go under the radar in many ways. And uhm, and you know there were certainly difficulties we know now at the last few years of his presidency with his memory and other functions. Uhm, and uhm, ah, you know so, there are lots of people who are very hive(ph), high functioning positions now, uhm, that ah, that, that may have Alzheimer's disease in the brain or may have early symptoms. And I think it is important to actually ah, understand ah, both as ah, as ah, as a health policy ah, reason you know ah, if people are having difficulties but also for, for, for future planning. Uhm, so I, I, I talk about those things I, I try to paint a realistic picture but I never take away hope. That's just not something that ah, ah, that I can do and I think I wouldn't recommend that because there's a difference between explaining and being realistic in saying there's no hope because you know people can really still ah, get meaning from illness and in some, in some cases diagnosed early enough, allow people then to make plans for the rest of their life about how, how they wanna prioritize things and what they wanna do and what they want, they wanna achieve personally and I tell them not to defer dreams and to, to really enjoy life now. And ah, I usually start things like vitamin E and vitamin C and fish oil and uhm, you know ah, ah, unli, unless they have a big problem with bleeding or major heart disease or things like that. And I usually start the first medication cholinesterase inhibitor and you know I, I bring the dose up very slowly over a number of weeks and, and did, unless they, they have some kind of medical di, condition that, that, that would prevent that uhm, then I you know add the, the, the other medication ah, o, on which is uhm, the glutamine antagonists and, and here actually I have some slides here that, that, there are some practice guidelines that, that, that talk about the difference in evidence you know and how much support there is for, for each inter, intervention. Uhm, but ultimately what I do is a lot of patients would(ph) also get a baby aspirin and coated aspirin ah, after I make sure they haven't been having problems with bleeding in the brain and things like that or, or GI bleeding or stomach bleeding. I try to be aggressive about managing uhm, other cardiovascular risk factors including lipids uhm, ah, and looking for uhm, any problems with vitamin B12 deficiency uhm, just as, as, as we as I mentioned that, that anxiety and depression should raise your red flag about ah, dementia ah, we screen for depression and anxiety a lot. Uhm, that, that is a (inaudible ) that occurs and you know it could be that they, they just have the apathy and some, sometimes the medications you know, again the expectation for medications isn't that their gonna go back to the way five years ago. It's not gonna bring back their memory functioning to a high level again. By that point, the memory structures and networks are so disrupted that we could hardly really have an effects on that oftentimes we may make attention a bit better. Preserve function a little bit more. Make them more fluent or less apathetic so they take more initiative for things in doing things. Uhm, and ah, so, so I do screen for depression in some cases, we'll, we'll give them uhm, some SSRIs you know some ah, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or things like that for, both for anxiety and depression ah, and uhm, and really, really trying to promote behavioral interventions. Ah, if I have to at the very, very end, I may sometimes uhm, use low dose ah, atypical antipsychotics with, I've exhausted everything else and I've made sure that they don't have a urine infection that's making them agitated. I make that's not a stressor, it's not the sleep-wake cycle, it's not that they're in pain and they can't ah, verbalize that that's causing them to be agitated or have, have other behaviors. After I've done all those things and, and still we can't manage things I may, I may have to ah, resort to that. I rarely will use ah, ah, a benzodiazepine. Ah, it can have paradoxical ah, agitation in, in, in elderly patients and, patients with Dementia and rarely use any stimulants. 

01:56:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Now, in terms of what you're saying in there, it also says that working with the older people, you'd better be up to date with the latest ah, counseling, cognitive behavior or other approaches... (crosstalk) 

01:56:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

01:56:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY  in handling depression because that can go both in the caregiver and in, and in the person and then the general anxiety issue is just the word styles(ph) anxiety. 

01:56:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:56:25
DR. ALLEN IVEY And so clearly being ready to handle anxiety disorders or anxiety traumas... (crosstalk) 

01:56:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

01:56:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...is really a central issue, again both for caregiver and for them. So, these are places where counselors can really help. Ah, I got a list of things here that ah, I picked up somewhere ah, recently, well, actually ah, from my own study about literature and ah, exercising could be real helpful for blood flow to the brain... (crosstalk) 

01:56:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:56:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...is an evidence of ah, relationships. Maintaining the relationship ...(crosstalk) 

01:57:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Absolutely. 

01:57:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...and not may mean the client's own way. Ah, and by the way your gonna find ah, ah, the viewer, they're gonna find this silent(ph) just like ah, heart center because it is maintaining weight, appropriate diet, (crosstalk) 

01:57:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:57:15
A healthy, socially-active lifestyle MAY delay the onset of symptoms 

01:57:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY get to sleep which you've already mentioned, (crosstalk) 

01:57:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:57:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY ah, mental stimulation, education, new task ah, basically it's the same as a healthy lifestyle. 

01:57:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI It is, it is and, and ah, uhm, all those ah, you know there's a, there's a, expanding literature on how basically uhm, you can decrease your Dementia risk factors by doing those things. Now, I won't say you can prevent the Alzheimer's disease itself in the brain but you may become much more resistant to the symptoms by basically uhm, you know making new connections, having better efficient pathways in the brain uhm, you know the bottom line is, is, is not the pathology in the brain. It's, it's, it's, how you cope with it. And... (crosstalk) 

01:58:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Would adhere to the multitasking is... (crosstalk) 

01:58:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right. 

01:58:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...and I, I was so impressed by Thoreau's ah, out here in Walden Pond... (crosstalk) 

01:58:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Simplifies, simplifies. 

01:58:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...it simplify and do what you do well but let's not do everything at a certain(ph) time. 

01:58:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Right, right, right. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

01:58:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY So what's next? 

01:58:20
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, yes so, yes, so all, all those things that your mentioning actually they're, they're, they're doing studies and they have small to medium effect sizes and, and you can imagine the, the goal would be at this time since we doin', don't have disease modifying drugs and we don't have medications that are highly sym, symptomatically beneficial you know, high effect sizes. Then you take all these things little by little and if you're gonna eke out just a little bit more ah, efficacy from each one of those things, why not? Uhm, ah, certainly they, they, they promote ah, better quality of life for folks. Uhm, the other important thing that has to be addressed and, and you know, we have social workers, ourselves, counselors ah, they can do this as, as addressing medico-legal issues ah, and legal issues. Ah, dual(ph) power of ah, attorney for health care and legal affairs uhm, you know planning for future care needs uhm, and uhm, uhm, genetic counseling as I mentioned that we, we do offer that to, to people we, we so, you know, we talk about it and if, if people wanted they can you know, ah, go that route but you know the, the, the, vast majority of people ah, we, we we're not gonna have ah, genetic test ah, we don't have that, for that yet. Uhm, and you know ah, in, in fam, in families that are very, very highly affected generation after generation ah, or early onset we have some markers for that. Uhm, and I can tell you that you know ah, after I've done the initial interview and, and you know at the end of it we talk about uhm, you know I, I mention when they first come in that you know I'm, I'm a cognitive neurologist. You're here because, other than yourself or someone in your family has recognized some change in you. Ah, it could be memory, it could be something else and everyone is worried about Alzheimer's disease, I always mention that word. I always mention Alzheimer's disease. Ah, because ever, it's on everybody's mind that I say, "Well yes, that's ah, that's an inappropriate concern from those people because of age." And I, I, I explain to them what the epidemiology is. That you know by time in your 70s you know 10, 20, 30 percent. Eighties you know, ah 80 you know 50 percent, 40, 40 to 50 percent ah, but again that, that you know, people can also have all this other processes going on that can contribute and then we do have some therapies and you know I, I said to them you know, by the end of this we'll get a sense of whether we should do more or not. So, after I do some of this testing I usually will say you know ah, it, it looks like I think I'm suspicious that, that this may not be normal aging and so when they go and actually do the test and come back and I, and I sit down to review with them the MRI, the blood work, the more expansive neuropsych(ph) testing of memory and language and things like that. And if, if, if it comes out that that's what it is, Alzheimer's disease I, I tell them the, the diagnosis. Ah, and it can be done in a kind and a compassionate manner and I'm humbled that people will come up to me and hug me at the end of that telling me its okay. And, and, and studies have shown that people actually on, that most people wanna know and it, and, and the, the old perceptions that, "Oh, you shouldn't diagnose it because your gonna throw the, throw everybody in a tizzy and you're gonna have, you're gonna you know make their quality of life worse" ah, it doesn't bare(ph) else. Uhm, just in the same way that you can't you know, if someone has cancer you can't, not diagnose them or give them chemotherapy without their consent. And uhm, ah, or say "Gosh, well, let's wait until it metastasizes until we give you, you know, all the different therapies for it." And uhm, so I'm humbled by the fact that they you know, you know, people can do well with that. But one thing I can tell you and I, and I, and I in, initially always make an assessment of, of, of driving safety, home safety. But in early stages most people can do well and studies have shown that patients with sort of early and mild Alzheimer's disease when dri, driving for a long time an, ah, and, and have pretty good you know, attention uhm, ah, in speed psychomotor speed ah, and visuospatial ah, orientation, their risk of actually getting in to car accidents is on average about this per mile driven is about the same or even maybe even less than teenage drivers. So, you know the independence of, of driving is a very important thing also. But I do address it and we do you know, some people need to get tested for that uhm, but I always say you have to minimize at least your chances and try to you know stick with, with local and familiar routes, ah, good weather conditions, not to go out on highways at nights and places you can get lost. But I can also tell you that, that when it, when it comes, time to, to sometimes you know really putting the foot down I don't get hugs when I, when I talk about driving and stopping it in some cases but it's something we have to do, it's very, very important. You see every, so often a story about somebody you know, who go to, goes on the wrong way ah, an elderly person going on a sidewalk killing many, many people, hurting people and uhm, it's something that, that really, really needs to be addressed and again counselors and therapists are in the front lines to recognize this things and talk about this things. And, it's a public health issue, it's, it's a uhm, caring about your patients issue and it's ah, it's a medical legal issue that needs to be addressed. Uhm, so that's something that I, that I, I talk about it. I have a whole slide here about why you admit, a, a, admis, a, a, a, a, a, you know addressee driving and, and uhm, you know to balance that, the risk of driving with the benefits of activity and maintaining in, in, in, independence and avoiding isolation and house arrest and if you have to refer for driving evaluation. And this is the big thing, caring for the caregivers again. Uhm, you know 50 percent of caregivers are probably clinically depressed at some point. Anxiety extremely externally high. Uhm, and again you know ah, ah, there, there's a, there's a quote uhm, ah, well lots of from a Persian poet that talks about you know huma, human beings being all parts of the same body. And if you know, if, if, if you know one part is in pain, you don't recognize that and you don't do something about it that we know, we don't deserve to be called human beings and, and this is, this is a major part of you know I, I see myself as somebody who cares not just for the patient but for the whole family and this is, this is a, a place where one can really uhm, help people who are in need and who are hurting. And so caring for the caregiver is to monitor for anxiety and depression ah, to give support, respite care, dare, day care for the ah, you know that stage appropriate for the patients is very, very important. So, and I have here when to treat well as soon as possible and, and here I go back to why. And bring it back to the principles of medical ethics. Uhm, why, why diagnose and treat early as possible? It gives you the greatest opportunity to care for patient's families for, for a long course(ph). Uhm, potentially the pathways in the brain are most viable early on. So why do you, why do you gonna wait until later. That doesn't make sense. Uhm, there are proven clinically significant benefits in populations of patients. Or(ph) behavioral interventions for ah, pharmacological treatments. And also allows the patient to make their own life de, decisions when they're most able to, regarding medical issues, (crosstalk) 

02:05:40
DR. ALLEN IVEY ...uh hmm. 

02:05:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  legal issues, financial issues, social issues you know psychological issues and to make beneficial lifestyle changes early on. 

02:05:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:05:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Uhm, it also allows people to have the possibility of entering clinical trials... (crosstalk) 

02:05:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:05:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...ah, if they want to. And, and very, very importantly it minimizes the potential for being exploited or abused because they're vulnerable and uhm, economically it's overall advantageous because uhm, well it depends on who's paying for it. But ah, but overall uhm, ah, it's really make sense to, to, to you know, delay the burden of, of them going to the nursing home and the cost. And ethically I say, you know the number one tenet is, is primum non nocere, "Above all do no harm" and you know, there's, there's safety in giving counseling to people. Show them interventions and, and there's a, there's a long track record for these, some you know, these medications in Alzheimer's disease. Uhm, there has been, bene, beneficence because of the efficacy data ah, there is non-maleficence because you can prevent them from, from, from, from harm and exploitation and then there is the principle of ja, of autonomy that patients and family should be master of their own fate. And we shouldn't be ah, paternalistic to decide whether you know, we think it's important for them you know ah, and we decide whether we tell them or not. I mean it has just has to be done in a culturally sensitive way in sa, in some cultures it's very difficult, they don't wanna know well, you work with them. But in general you know ah, autonomy means that they you know if, ah, they should know if they want to. And, and then it comes back to social justice. Justice is a, is a, is a principle of medical you know, it's one of the principles of medical ethics that you know this care should be available to everybody. It shouldn't just be available to, to people coming to see me in, in clinic and MGH or, or people like me. It should be available to everybody and so, this is why we, I think it's important to, to diagnose and treat early.

Chapter 9 Memory for Faces Test Revisited 

02:07:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  I have this little slide to remind me that we're coming back again to something and here I have a slide that shows uhm, kinda like ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, a slave galley ship like the Ben-Hur, if you saw that movie and we have this big football players on one side basically and we have this really skinny folks on the other side. Ah, and basically we have two guys saying I, I've got it too, or(ph) my strange feeling like we've been going in circles and then you know, these people are paddling on one side are stronger obviously so they probably taking the ship like this and so ah, and probably a, a lack of judgments on this par, on their part at problem solving but I put that in there because we're back to something and here we go. I had you a long time ago. See this person's name? So see if you can remember who she was. Okay? There we go, that's right. That's Lauren. That's ah, Earl you're right. 

02:08:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Hmm. 

02:08:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Usually people, some people say you now, some people would say Susan and other people say, she wasn't in, in the slide and yes, that's right. She wasn't in the slide, that was a lure. I never showed you this picture. Susan is actually younger person, so I threw that in there, okay and this one Lenny. Very good. Okay. So I put that in there because, this is a very difficult task and we do this both with the younger people and older people, even people with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. We put glasses on them, goggles on them, we put them in the fMRI scanner. An fMRI is something that uhm, is a neuro-technology that doesn't just look at structure but also looks at function. So it looks at how blood oxygens(ph) and levels change in the areas of the brain where there is synaptic activity and basically we can see a correlate(ph) of synaptic activity, if what, networks in the brain are more active when we're doing something like learning a new face and name. So some of the pictures we show over and over again like Susan over and over and over again and some pictures we only use, show once. And basically what we do is we do a contrast. We can do basically look at the times when they're seeing a patient a, a, a, a face and name once or repeatedly. So this n is a novel and r is to repeat it and sometimes we just show them fixation crosses. And basically we could, we show that there is synoptic activity that's much more in this hippocampus. When they see a novel picture, face and name versus when they see just a fixation cross versus when they see repeated picture. So the hippocampus likes novelty and I guess(ph) habituated(ph) kind of early in the sense that the activity goes down if you continue to see something. But for novel thing boom! It activate because it was trying to remember and put that name and face together, bind it together. Right(ph) here, he, here on, on the left of this coronal sections again, cross sections of the brain and, and basically what you're seeing here in, in colored pictures is the, the, the degree of activity when you see a novel picture versus a repeated picture. And in, in young people there's a lot more activity in the hippocampus. In older people we actually, there's, there's some, there's a fair bit and early Alzheimer's patients you can see or mild Alzheimer's down here for example, you see that almost there's, it's almost on the level of noise, almost. There's maybe a hint more activity during novel than on repeated but it, it starts to get really, 'coz(ph) the signal and noise end up being a little bit corrupted and, and, and kind of running it together. So we use this technology. We're trying to use some of this things as one of the other ways to, to hopefully understand memory systems... (crosstalk) 

02:11:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:11:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...and how to detect people early and see if, if medications can help and it's, it's and it's very specific so it's not, so this is the hippocampus right that's being affected. But here on this slide, this is the fusiform face area. This is the fusiform gyrus where ah, this area of the brain have a lot of synaptic activity when faces are shown. And as you can see in young patients, old patients were normal in Alzheimer's patients you have a very good activation there. So it's very specific, it's not that every part of the brain is affected. Not every area and every node is affected. But certainly the epicenters of memory networks seemed to be affected much more earlier. 

02:11:50
Chapter 10: Future of Diagnosis and Treatment 

02:11:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  So the future of the diagnosis and treatment that you want me to touch on a little bit... (crosstalk) 

02:12:00
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

02:12:00
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...is that we're gonna hopefully see uhm, some, not only the, the, the plaques and tangles ah, but more than anything we're understanding that before they get in to, to being plaques uhm, you know these, these amyloid proteins that are, that tend to be sticky and toxic are going around, stuck together in pairs of two or three or more and they are directly uhm, affecting synapses and destroying them. So by the time we actually see plaques, this maybe ten years down the line and so, where can we see this stuff? Where we can see the effects, well, were probably gonna need multi-modal imaging. We'll(ph) probably need some genetics information, probably need some structural(ph) information from an MRI or a functional information from fMRI or some other kinds of functional information about ah, with, with, with, with glucose PET or maybe even with things that directly are showing if there's, there's actually ah, amyloid in the brain or not. So here, this is a very standard slide from ah, ah, doing ah, Pittsburgh Compound-B PIB. This is a compound that's it, is still experimental and red here is bad. Basically, their tagging this compound PIB and it's going into, into the brain and the more red it is, it means that there's probably more amyloid in the blood vessels in the, the blood vessel walls and probably around the blood vessel walls, in the parenchyma of the brain. And you can see ah, ah, of, of, ah, a nicely chosen example from Alzheimer's patients shows tons of, of, of the uptake of this PIB tracer in the brain. Whereas a nice control person, healthy doesn't have any. Now, you may ask, "Why don't we have this?" well it's because we're finding that there are people right now who are healthy, are pure healthy and yet have some PIB in the brain. (crosstalk) 

02:13:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:13:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI And, and, and, and some of my colleagues here, like Dr. Keith Johnson, Reisa Sperling and uhm, and Randy Buckner, they are following these people for years now to see what happens to them. It can just be used as ba, as ah, biomarker and, and ah, certainly the Pittsburgh group uhm, ah, who won a, a major award for this this year. Uhm, so ah, Dr. Matheson(ph) Clark(ph) so uhm, here is an example of how, maybe in the future we can use a combination of things with functional imaging, structural imaging, PET both glucose PET and, and, and things like Pittsburgh Compound-B, amyloid imaging and, to combine things early on to get a picture of how this things work together. Where you know somebody, in the, in NC, MCI stage who doesn't have PIB in the brain uhm, is acting a certain way on, on fMRI uhm, ah, and, and yet here is somebody with actual familial Alzheimer's disease has the gene, we know... (crosstalk) 

02:14:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

02:14:50
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...he's gonna be, he's gonna convert yet doing, ver, you know, doing well at this stage but already showing PIB in the brain. Showing decreases here in the FDG PET and the glucose and showing very bad patterns of activation, poor activation and deactivation in the brain on fMRI so almost... (crosstalk) 

02:15:10
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:15:10
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...showing as a, as a signature or a marker that there's go, there's gonna be impending uhm, ah, you know ah, dysfunction of the, of the memories systems... (crosstalk) 

02:15:15
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

02:15:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  even though they're not showing clinical signs as much. (crosstalk) 

02:15:20
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yet(ph), people on that bottom road might not be showing clinical sign. 

02:15:25
DR. ALIREZA ATRI Correct. We're trying to figure out you know, how early can you catch this things. So, hopefully in the next ten years or so we'll understand this much better because well, once we have this, this modifying medications we need to, we need to be able to tell somebody at, at age 50 let's say, "Gosh you know, I think based on all this different things you may have a 95 percent chance that in the next ten years you may develop Dementia and here is a medicine you take daily that has maybe ah, one to two percent increase, let's say risk of stroke to go along with it." Uhm, this is the, (clears throat) this is the decision analysis and what would you, what would you do. 'Coz we can't certainly take, do we take everybody and vaccinate them or give them the drugs after age 50, we don't know this things. So, these are the things that are gonna be actually big public health issues. Uhm, so the next generation of treatments really are aimed at underlying pathology and mechanisms including amyloid and, and tau and the hope is that they'll slow, slow down progression and I won't go in, go into but there are number of them are getting into ah, the later phase of phase two and phase three. Uhm, and ah, you know we have to understand one of the risk involved, do they efficacy uhm, really ah, if can we bind them and get rid of them ah, uhm, and would that help. So the, this are the things that are, are going on. 

02:16:40
Chapter 11 Conclusions 

02:16:40
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Ah, so in conclusion I want to sort of talk about that ah, that prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Dementia is gonna triple over the next 30, 40 years. The standard of care really is to diagnose and treat ah, ah, Alzheimer's disease early uhm, that aging really is not sufficient that to know the, isn't synonymous with, with the aging. Uhm, that there are things we can do to, to really modify our, our, ah, risk for Dementia even though you know the disease in the brain may pro, pro, pro, progress we maybe more resistant to showing this symptoms by promoting the, a, a, a, a, healthy lifestyle. Physical exercise, mental activity, social engagement, sleep hygiene, decreasing stress, uhm, ah, you know losing weight ah, maybe even a low calo, calorie, restricted diet perhaps, who knows. Uhm, ah, but that really it's important to diagnose and treat people because and, and this is again important for counselors and, and therapists 'coz, 'coz you know you, you are actually in the, in, in the front lines. You're gonna see a lot of people, elderly with, with uhm, changes in their behavior with anxiety depressive symptoms and this could be ah, ah, heralding sign of an impending ah, ah, ah, Dementia and the, the, diagnosis delayed really is, is, is, is delayed care. Uhm, and it's denying care, it's denying autonomy, denying just(ph) justice. Uhm, and so you know, knowing when to refer is very important about, based on some of the things we talked about today. Uhm, the, you know we have both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments ah, including you know two different class of medications that are FDA approved uhm, that you know the treatments all of them, you know have a small to moderate effect sizes that are not mutually exclusive so in some ways you can add them together ah, including the pharmacological treatments that there is good safety and tolerability profile certainly for you know care or giving care to people and, and, and educating them and giving them counseling but also for the medications. It has very impa, it's imperative to, to provide support to the patients and families uhm, to prevent further harm to them and to society and to the families and there is a really of great need to educate ah, people ah, about the course of Alzheimer's, about moderating expectations, planning for the future uhm, and all these can be done really uhm, very much in a multi-disciplinary(ph) way ah, with, with counselors and therapists being ah, really, really an integral part of this. Uhm, and here I have a ah, another cartoon that's basically has ah, ah, the scope, the gun scope there with the target like this and someone's looking down the barrel and looking at the scope and it has two barrels in the wilderness and one of them is ah, even though the target's on, on him, he's going like this so the other barrel is saying you know get this one. And I, and I have here sa, sa, the, the, this, our need to hit the right target and uhm, and ah, you know the real, the, the target being that, has to be in our radar and uhm, and uhm, in conclusion I have ah, quote here uhm, that ah, my, my colleague Jim Allison actually used ah, the water slide that I, that I like to use, (inaudible ) actually and ah, this quote that I like ah, it says, "Where there is no hope there can be no endeavor" by Samuel Johnson and I, I really think the glass is more ah, than half full ah, it depends on your perspective and this is my, my card, my license plate if you see me it says "CUREAD", so it's not CU READ, it's actually CURE AD and ah, it's certainly this is something I, I feel very strongly about and ah, hopefully ah, my lifetime ah, that will be something we can affect. I wanna really acknowledge the patients and families that, that have contributed to my understanding ah, of this condition who volunteer for our studies uhm, who donate their time and their efforts and, and their ah, their knowledge with us and their money uhm, and my colleagues and my family certainly who, who I've learned a lot from and, and supports me and, and again I have the, the last slide here uhm, of ah, (laughing) that says Midvale School for the Gifted I think you know that is, there's ah, it's a student going in and the door says "Pull" on it and, and he's trying to push it open and this is exactly how I feel everyday uhm, and ah, hopefully one day ah, we'll be able to, to pull the door open and, and ah, effect also a cure. Uhm, okay I, I leave you here with a quote from Marsel Mesulam. 

02:21:15
"Few prospects are as frightening as the gradual dissolution of mental faculties. The affectionate ties to family and friends, a lifetime's accumulation of passionate likes and dislikes, the complex fabric of individual remembrances are all gradually blurred and distorted as the patient is left with a body that appears healthy but a consciousness that is gradually stripped of its content. The toll that this process takes on the patient and family members is incalculable." -M. -Marsel Mesulam, M.D. Chapter 12: Final Thoughts and Disclosures 

02:21:15
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Well, I think it's just very important for, for us to understand this as, a as a public health issue and problem and uhm, in my current(ph) research you know, I'm I, I'm involved in clinical trials ah, as a matter to understand what's going on as far as how we can detect it early on and ah, and a service for my patient. My work is, is much more on early detection and trying to use this fMRI technology and integrate it with other types of maybe genetic information uhm, poor dynamic(ph) information ah, biomarkers from the blood, cognitive testing results uhm, maybe things like uhm, fancy EEG's that, that give you brainwave studies. (crosstalk) 

02:22:30
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:22:30
DR. ALIREZA ATRI  Uhm, structural(ph) MRI, looking at the structure of the brain and to combine these things using mathematical models to understand ah, hopefully to be able to, to, in ten years time be able to say something on the individual level. (crosstalk) 

02:22:45
DR. ALLEN IVEY Oh. 

02:22:45
DR. ALIREZA ATRI 'Coz right now, it's all in the group level and it's very difficult when they say, "can you tell me something about what to expect?" I can say something generally, but really what we need to do is to have personalized(ph) medicine in the future... (crosstalk) 

02:22:55
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:22:55
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...to be able, to be able to, to use restratification and this involves probably some math and... (crosstalk) 

02:23:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

02:23:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...probably some modeling and some integration of, of, of various types and knowledge and uhm, so I'm hoping to, to do that and ah, and so that's sort of our uhm, my, my approach and ah, uhm, over the next year I'm, I'm starting a lab at the VA actually the Veterd, Veterans ah, Administration and staying up at, at MGH also but uhm, we're, we're starting the ah, ah, Center for Translation kind of Neuroscience that try to effect some of these things from the lab all the way to the patients and uhm, and ah, ah, so, yes and, and I get the Alzheimer's Conferences coming up that happens every two years. Ah, I'm presenting uhm, some, some studies on basically functional imaging and whether uhm, ah, ah, it, it, it can be used in clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease to, to identify uhm, direct candidates quickly uhm, because we probably have drugs that are sitting somewhere ah, they can help us but... (crosstalk) 

02:24:05
DR. ALLEN IVEY Uh hmm. 

02:24:05
DR. ALIREZA ATRI ...what most people don't appreciate, and it, it took me a, a long time to appreciate this. How difficult, trial(ph) development(ph), and how costly it is and how it's important to very quickly identify candidates so people can you know, companies can, can focus on, on, on sort of the, the, the, the drugs that are most promising as opposed to you know, putting their money down in doing trials, need to be two or three years long involving thousands of patients and at the end to figure out that, that, that you know it didn't work or that the design wasn't right. So, those are the kind of things that I'm, I'm hoping to help with and ah, and uhm, and I appreciate you know, you, you're giving me this opportunity to uhm, to you know to, to bring this important issue to all counselors and therapists and ah, and for your support. 

02:24:50
DR. ALLEN IVEY Yeah.
