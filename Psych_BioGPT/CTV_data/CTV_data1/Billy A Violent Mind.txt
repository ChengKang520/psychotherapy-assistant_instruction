BILLY Walked down the road I see these shadows getting closer and closer. Two people walk in front of me and try and block my way. I push past them. I know when they're gonna kick in. I'm weary of the knifes or they got any knives on them. Two fellows block me off again. Ah, I don't hesitate this time. I just-- I put one straight in the face and punched him off. As he goes down I kicked him in the buttocks. A lot of them runs across the road and laughed at him, attack him. I really wanna kill this bastard and kick his fucking face in. And I really got that down on his face, got his hair and I (inaudible ) his face and I mean, I wanna just kick his fucking face to the back of his head. I've had enough. I just wanna be left alone. I'm banging his head on the floor, his blood splattered everywhere and then this voice says, "So did you kill him? Did you kill him?" I remember looking at my eyes and so I has-- to blow them my hands and then I ran and just 

00:01:30
BILLY a violent mind 

00:01:35
VERONIKA HYKS Billy is afraid. He lives in fear of killing people in an act of uncontrollable rage. He has good reason to worry for Billy has a violent past. Both as a soldier and Liverpudlian gangland thug. He's never been convicted of a criminal offense and now the violence has stopped but Billy is left with a debilitating obsession. 

00:02:00
KIM MILLER He's a 43-year-old gentleman whose single, unemployed, form Liverpool. His main problem is a 24-year fear of going berserk and harming people who have been-- who are unable to defend themselves. Thought to care anytime, anywhere and whether he's alone or with a group of people. The impact on, ah, his life is obviously being very severe. It's affected his relationship with his ex-partner and his daughter Heather. He's got several ways of reassuring himself. The handcuffs, the mobile phone and the van are major physical reassurances. He pays bodyguards to go with him when he's leaving the house and he gave up employment because he felt that whilst in employment, he was having lots of money to spend on bodyguards and it was just reinforcing this problem. His mood dropped drastically on the absence of... 

00:02:50
BILLY Body guards were there because I used to think I was gonna go out and I used to feel that they would hold me down a lot somebody stop me from going insane. People see me with these people all the time, thought that I was a (inaudible ). I used to make enough money to keep my obsession going. I have my own building corporation, ah, it has to do in property. 

00:03:15
BILLY One particular week as we settle on £52, 32 pints. And, you know, it's 32 pints that annoyed me. They're being kept in the council but I'm saying that when you're that fearful and terrified you'd pay anything. What triggers my problems are people. Whenever I see people I become anxious, tense, neurotic, obsessive, uhm, they are the trigger to my obsessions. When I see people, I just want a room and if safe, the institute asked me to go on a tube station in London I would feel that I was going mad and that's-- it anybody got in my way then I'd them, you know, kick them and panic and scream. The crazy thing about it is that if I carry these in the streets I feel secure and if the worse comes to the worst then I just-- I could be subdued with a gun (inaudible ). I didn't have to. I felt sorely out of control. I'd feel like go berserk and go mad. I almost scared any person, anybody. With myself I'm scared and that's the problem. With having a violent, uhm, past I've seen what violence does to people and, ah, I know what I've done to people, you know. Uhm, and in my head, the damage that I've done to people I feel that would do to people around me. Looking back, I can see I was very aggressive, ah, violent. People were scared of me. 

00:04:45
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's sanctuary is his mobile home. During the last 9 years, he's often retreated here even when he visits his young daughter who lives with his former partner Billy stays overnight in his van. 

00:05:00
BILLY Well I have a, a 3-year-old daughter I've been not able to take care of or go anywhere with. But she's, ah, quite some. She's, ah, very precious. Both the compulsion and the phase actually stop me. Form a deep relationship with her and had a panic attack. I'd be stuck with this 3-year-old baby so it's not her that I'm scared of. I'm scared of my reaction. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN I wanna get out. This one. 

00:05:35
BILLY Well, I mean I just kind of build up a normal relationship with, ah, with anybody so it's-- it affects every single area of my life. 

00:05:50
BILLY Okay. Call me. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:05:55
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's obsession has made him suicidal. He's decided to seek help at London's top psychiatric hospital, the Maudsley but Billy dreads the journey south. 

00:06:05
BILLY I feel like sailing back because, uhm, I feel anxious and I know that I've got 3 months of treatment ahead of me and I've journeyed 240 miles. 

00:06:15
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's fear of people means that's he's only willing to travel as night and he always avoids major roads. But to leave Liverpool, he must enter the Mersey Tunnel. 

00:06:25
BILLY It's a situation I can't just leave so I'm trapped. And the symptoms you get is tightness in the chest, sweats tells me I'm gonna go mad, ah, (inaudible ) like that, any situation that I cannot just leave makes me obsessive. Now I'm on a toll on-- you see these cars coming down to where we go. When I become upset with the thing I'm gonna deliberately crash into them, wanna jump out the vehicle and then tear 'em back. In the past, what I've done is I actually stopped and got one of the Mersey side tunnel policemen to drive through it. The worst time I had is when I was coming off drugs. I was hallucinating quite by then. I got into the tunnel and, ah, I tried to jump out the vehicle. I was really that bad. They had to hold me down and they sort of tie me up. 

00:07:20
VERONIKA HYKS Billy has come to a unique unit at the Maudsley which specializes in phobias and obsessions. A team of psychiatrists and nurses will devise a treatment program for him but its success depends on how much he wants to be cured. 

00:07:35
KIM MILLER This room here, right and this is your key. 

00:07:40
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's nurse therapist is Kim Miller. 

00:07:40
KIM MILLER Mission and I actually let you into the fund and this is worse. And this room, uhm, This is... 

00:07:50
BILLY Well, it's all right. 

00:07:50
KIM MILLER This is your inn. 

00:07:50
BILLY Yeah, nice.. 

00:07:50
KIM MILLER Ah, and this room will be your room even when you're going home late. 

00:07:55
BILLY Yeah. 

00:07:55
KIM MILLER You just take the key will you. 

00:08:00
BILLY It's in the horizon. 

00:08:00
KIM MILLER It's quite nice. 

00:08:00
BILLY Beautiful. 

00:08:00
KIM MILLER Now you're responsible for changing your own bed linen - 

00:08:05
BILLY Yeah. 

00:08:05
KIM MILLER - and there is a living cupboard so you help yourself anytime whenever you feel the need to train you. 

00:08:10
BILLY Okay, fine. 

00:08:10
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's fellow patients at the 11 bed unit suffer from a wide range of severe obsessions. Fear if dirt, fear of vomit, fear of imperfection, fear of colors, even a fear of Jack the Ripper. All of the patients are here for face their fears. 

00:08:30
BILLY I can only do what I can do and, you know, that got to just, ah, keep telling myself, ah, that I'm not gonna be, ah, super violent. I'm not gonna be home secure, you know what I mean. It is an improvement, that's great. 

00:08:40
Week I 

00:08:45
VERONIKA HYKS The unit wants Billy to confront his fears without the supporting props he's come to rely upon. He's already left his bodyguards behind in Liverpool. Now he must try to let go of his mobile phone, his handcuffs and his van. 

00:08:55
KIM MILLER What we're gonna do today, we'll be looking at your, uhm, goals to treatment, your long term goal to treatment. We've been looking at what you'd like to achieve at the end of treatment and that doesn't mean just when you leave here you're going into follow up for a year so we're looking at what you'd like to be achieving in about 6 months to a year from now. What I usually think, uhm, advise you to do is think about the impact of problems having on your life and if you could do these things, your life would improve drastically. That's the way to look at it. 

00:09:30
BILLY Oh. Public transport, ah, going into city center. 

00:09:35
KIM MILLER Go on. 

00:09:40
BILLY I want to change. 

00:09:40
KIM MILLER So you'd like to go to a gallery or a cinema and museum, you like too. 

00:09:45
BILLY Museum is not rough. 

00:09:45
KIM MILLER Oh, all right. Spending time with people and then the other big thing here is that we're sticking out one paper is about daylight hours. 

00:09:55
BILLY Mmm. 

00:09:55
KIM MILLER But at the moment, you avoid traveling when its light. 

00:10:05
BILLY When you see them black and white it, it really-- it's-- I realize, ah, I see before that I am, uhm, handicapped. You know what I mean. 

00:10:15
KIM MILLER Your life in-- 

00:10:15
BILLY Yeah. 

00:10:15
KIM MILLER But you know what? It's as you said, it's come across before. Your way of coping with things almost to laughing it off or block things out and get on with life. 

00:10:25
BILLY Yeah. 

00:10:25
KIM MILLER And you've got quite good at that but unfortunately by cutting it out we're talking about... 

00:10:30
BILLY (inaudible ). 

00:10:31
KIM MILLER We're focusing on it. We can't block it out. I'm not allowing you to block it out and that's why it's so difficult for you. 

00:10:35
BILLY Mmm. 

00:10:40
VERONIKA HYKS Treatment of the unit requires patients to set themselves daily tasks which expose them to their fears. The theory is that if they do this repeatedly and for long enough, their panic attacks will subside. Billy is writing out his daily task sheet in which he must grade his anxiety level before, during and after each task. From zero for no stress to 8 for real terror. 

00:11:05
BILLY Part of my program is to, is to carry a knife. They want me to carry knives, ah, with me because I don't particularly like violence. Uhm, then they make me carry a knife. This is a Swiss army knife. Rounding units(ph) after cutting or handle I should say, uhm, a carving knife, uhm, because these are symbols of violence and that's, you know, they want me to sort of chop melons up and things like that. There has to be other people around when I do this and, ah, I bought myself a melon and I've been chopping it up. 

00:11:45
Professor Isaac Marks Head of Behaviour Psychotherapy Unit 

00:11:50
ISAAC MARKS The philosophy behind the therapy is, ah, called exposure therapy. The idea being the sufferer from obsessive-compulsive disorder or phobias, other anxiety problems, expose themselves to those things which bring on their problems. Then the fear that it induces gradually dies down, subsides. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN We don't actually know for sure the causes are. Sometimes, I mean, obviously certain people-- you can l link it to a specific event. Ah, something bad happened to them and after that event they developed these behaviors. But in other people, it seems just sort of insidiously creep up on them and for no apparent reason. As that was... 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN With me it was, ah, I saw the dead body first time in my life - 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN - when I was about, ah, 26. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN And, ah, it was the horrible I ever saw in my life. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN So what did you start doing after that experience. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN I was scared. I was really scared to live in the house even in the day time. And then, ah, I think I started, ah, uhm, you know, gaining a few habits. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, what sort of things did you start to do? 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Washing hands and then washing clothes in, ah, ah, particular ways. 

00:13:25
BILLY Uhm, my initial task is just to mix with people in this group, in this unit. Like yesterday, I walked past a patient and talked to them. As he went up the wall he was nearly crying, you know, and contaminated that and, you know, I mean I just walked past that. I just brushed against that. And it was like he's ever tried to vapor, you know, she's crying and she's upset and she had to go and change her clothes and things like that. So, ah, it's not so easy in this place. You have to really be aware of about people's problems. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN I'm not afraid that I'm gonna pick up germs. I just feel contaminated whenever I'm, uhm, physically in contact with other people cuz I've worked in the hospital for 15 years and I never had a fear of infection when I worked there. I do feel contaminated all day long but I cannot contaminate certain parts of my clothing even though I know my, my-- I'm contaminating myself. 

00:14:20
BILLY Most of these people are, are scared of being contaminated by people and mostly the way around, you know. I, I think that I'm gonna bash you on, like, the face or whatever, you know. 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:30
BILLY So I, I couldn't possible walk up to the other thing and punch you in the face. And you just, you know, you gone a mile. 

00:14:35
SALLY Probably, as you probably saw last night, ah, when we watched, ah, watched the film last night I do have rather problems with my behavior in films that I find difficult. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN Try and tell the group about most did you-- you're frightened frightened of Sally. 

00:14:50
SALLY Frightened of anything supernatural happening after I've watched supernatural type video. If you hear sort of screaming noise, you will have it coming from the video room. I try not to but... 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN So what you're saying is that when you're doing-- and the videos are part of your exposure. 

00:15:10
SALLY Yes. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN And when you watch these videos, your anxiety - 

00:15:15
SALLY Is eight. 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN - is eight and that's... 

00:15:15
SALLY Yeah, 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN That makes you scream. 

00:15:20
SALLY Yes, right. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN And. 

00:15:20
SALLY Ah, so whatever I do-- I, I mean I don't hog video room and I think, well I'll put a little note on the door, Sally doing exposure. 

00:15:30
BILLY The people that I'm sort of looking back, ah, with all respect to them, you know, I mean obsession is obsession. You know the, there's never any conversation of and I think intellectual. It's always forget obsessions, obsessions, obsessions. How many-- close your ears, I, I, I, I, I, me, me, me, me, me, me. 

00:15:55
BILLY See, Sally reads the newspaper. 

00:16:00
SALLY Here(ph). 

00:16:00
BILLY Okay, well. 

00:16:00
SALLY All right, now look. I mean look at all this. This is the stuff I picked up from London yesterday. 

00:16:05
BILLY Could you have looked at this a few weeks ago? 

00:16:05
SALLY No. 

00:16:05
BILLY Well, how's it feels a few weeks ago. 

00:16:10
SALLY I screamed. I mean, it's not to say one day goes by without me thinking there, a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper and I'm terrified basically. 

00:16:15
BILLY Yes. So how many times did your fears come true. 

00:16:20
SALLY Uhm, with all the things have gone wrong in my life. 

00:16:25
BILLY No, I'm asking when was the last time you possessed-- when was the last time a bolt of lightning hit you? 

00:16:30
SALLY Well it's missed me so far. 

00:16:30
BILLY So what-- why is it gonna happen tomorrow? 

00:16:35
SALLY I don't know if it's gonna happen tomorrow. I, I don't know when it's gonna happen. That's the frightening thing. 

00:16:40
BILLY But also... 

00:16:40
SALLY That's the frightening thing. 

00:16:40
BILLY Why, why should the devil pick you? Why won't it pick Margaret Thacher? 

00:16:45
SALLY Why should it pick me? Because... 

00:16:45
BILLY Don't agree. 

00:16:45
SALLY I don't know. I mean... 

00:16:45
BILLY Stop being so arrogant. 

00:16:50
SALLY I mean, I don't particularly want to be here. I don't-- be one of the chosen and I could do without-- I could really do without it all. 

00:17:00
BILLY I'll tell you what Sal that the little bit I know about that but I know about that. 

00:17:00
SALLY Mmm. 

00:17:00
BILLY Maybe in the back of the (inaudible ) when it comes to being possessed. 

00:17:10
Week 2 

00:17:15
[music] 

00:17:20
KIM MILLER All you've done up to now is you spend up to two and half hours with a group of people. You haven't been outside the hospital grounds alone and you haven't been on public transport alone and you can call it the hospital bus but it doesn't matter. It's still a bus and its really no different than being on public transport. And in fact it can be more difficult because that bus will not stop. Remember, your anxiety up 'til now has been threes and fours. That might be eight. It's about feeling confident and getting trusting and being confident about doing exposures. What's your anxiety like thinking about it? 

00:17:55
BILLY Ah, butterflies. 

00:17:55
KIM MILLER You have butterflies. 

00:17:55
BILLY Yeah, and you know, butterflies. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN I mean, getting the bust on his groin, you know, the average person would think, Well what the big deal about that? But for me it's, ah, if the other person can imagine jumping off a cliff, well that's what it feels like for me. I get on a bus and go and see in the Castle tube station. 

00:18:25
[music] 

00:18:40
BILLY That's the first time I've done something like this for years. The attitude was bullocks too. I get, ah, obsessive part which tell me to jump off, get off the bus. If I get off the bus I would go berserk, if you stay on the bus you'll go berserk. 

00:19:05
BILLY I don't mind them seeing them seeing me on a bus, sweating, shaking because I'm not gonna see them again. I'm, I'm not bothered at all, that's the point. Don't wanna-- don't wanna be there. Jumping up, strangling someone. With books or kicking someone in the balls. I mean they're the sort thoughts that go through me at and I'm just gonna start lashing out. I mean, do you imagine, ah, me sitting on a bus and decides a little old lady influence me. I feel like punching your head. I mean can you imagine that, (inaudible ) that shock? So you, you don't off load your fears and put feelings with other people. I wouldn't dream of it. 

00:19:40
BILLY Last year when this boat started I was in the backyard, I was by myself and, ah, (inaudible ) kill those two kids next door. 

00:19:50
KIM MILLER Right. Did you have any-- in what way did you think you're gonna harm them. 

00:20:00
BILLY Stab them. 

00:20:00
KIM MILLER Stab them. How did you cope? 

00:20:05
BILLY There was agony. I don't complaint it and, ah, she said, "You're just having a panic attack." But it wasn't. I've never experienced, ah, the, ah, the force, the allergy sets-- whatever. So bad that my legs would buckle and I couldn't even stand up. 

00:20:20
KIM MILLER So it probably was a panic attack but it was an extreme one and the thoughts were so intense at the time - 

00:20:25
BILLY Oh, yeah. 

00:20:25
KIM MILLER - that you probably... 

00:20:25
BILLY The telephone. 

00:20:25
KIM MILLER Yeah, that's why it's awful but that was an extreme panic attack. 

00:20:25
BILLY Yeah, I'd never had one like that. That, that was the worse. Normally if that would have happened that would have gone only (inaudible ) away." 

00:20:35
KIM MILLER Oh. 

00:20:35
BILLY But it was that bad I couldn't even do that. I looked out in the streets and there was sort of the kids playing on the street. I was almost trapped. 

00:20:40
Week 4 

00:20:40
VERONIKA HYKS The only way Billy can really confront many of his fears is by returning to Liverpool. He must visit the places he normally avoids, places that remind him of his violent past. 

00:20:55
BILLY A gang had been hustling me and I went out there and he was standing on the corner. I jumped and grabbed one of them and I threw him over the boot of the car and I stuck this gun on the back of his neck, the nape of his neck and actually I took the first press on the trigger. Uhm, he was about a 64th of an inch at the back of his head blown through his face and I just ended up, pistol whipping and kicking his other. This particular house here, number three, Vallery road is where I used to live and in August '82 I was taken and it took a it and I stopped taking. I started drinking again after 8 years and what happened is it literally went of my head. What it was I don't know, there was nothing in my mind, nothing like that. I just need to be shot down so-- and I blasted the bathroom door through, blasted the ceilings through. The staircase, the front door, the whole lot. Unless they're being really pissed off with everything that has happened. All the violence is just never ending and I had the weapons and, ah, a shotgun. A .22 semi- automatic pistol, semi-automatic rifle and AR-7. I'll have hand grenades and things like that and what I did is I went down a police station and it's just from these goals on account. I was sent to a secure unit in Reno(ph) Mental Hospital. While I got there, they said to me, "If you're not martyr just don't drink. Don't drink and you'll be okay." Uhm, but then what started in the-- and that's what I-- from the particular time that's when I want, I want violence behind me. I really had enough. It was just a matter of time before I kill someone, you know. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:45
BILLY This is (inaudible ) street from days before I lived here and in the street I was, ah, stabbed. I was stabbed in the head. I was with people whose, ah, I've got no good memories at all of actually being in the street. 

00:23:05
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's mother had five children and she was often ill and exhausted. She had a violent temper and Billy was frequently beaten. 

00:23:10
BILLY Well, I was really scared of my mom and she was very aggressive and violent. Really, she was aggressive with me. I was the only one at the house and the others were sick, you know, the are-- Program boxing, TV. Mom was institutionalized so I got the shit. I have compassion for it at all and the patient. Again, until, ultimately, it was controlled, you know people. Hatred's too painful, horrible. Well I was prayer singing when she died. I think I cry and then she only, ah, ah, need mourning and so. At the funeral, all the kids from my class and Eddie's class were there and, uhm, as we walked down I think we just burst out crying. I remember thinking, why can't Michael? 

00:24:10
KIM MILLER So what stopped you from crying? 

00:24:15
BILLY I've never cried. 

00:24:15
KIM MILLER You control it. It's okay to cry. I'm not gonna stop you. 

00:24:30
BILLY I wish I could kill. I know that my problem is all bottled up shit, you know, bottled up emotions, years and years. I can see that so clearly now but at the time I couldn't. And then I never ever associated my past with the present states of mind. 

00:24:50
KIM MILLER We cope with things in the best way possible at the time and sometimes the best ways to suppress feelings and emotion and painful memories and blocking them out which you've done. In that way you haven't had to break down. You might have felt like a tiny need to tears but you can distract yourself and there's lots of other things you've done probably so you haven't come to state of breaking down behind tears. But I can see it in your face today. It's definitely a sadness. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
BILLY Until I was good and (inaudible ). 

00:25:35
KIM MILLER I don't get one. You apply yourself when you talk about things, I think you apply yourself. What you say that Billy? 

00:25:45
BILLY I wanted to slay the army. 

00:25:50
VERONIKA HYKS Billy joined the army when he was 18. He was sent to Northern Ireland just weeks before bloody Sunday when British troops shot dead 13 protestors. 

00:26:00
BILLY I get flashbacks to Bloody Sunday. And we were there at that operation and the palace(ph) got withdrawn and we had take on the flak and stake off the people. It was awful. People spit in our faces, you know, attacking us. You know, I was quite, ah, quite a referee. Seeing bodies, people being shot in the head, things like that. It's, it's things that I'll remember for the rest of my life and the heartbeat(ph). 

00:26:25
KIM MILLER What other facial limiters that you're actually getting? 

00:26:30
BILLY One particular one was a fellow who was shot through the, through the head. 

00:26:30
KIM MILLER Fine. 

00:26:30
BILLY Ah, he was, ah, dragged at the back of a wagon. He was still alive, he, he'd peer out this, ah, like hole in his head and he was dragged at the back of this wagon and head's hit the floor 5 foot below and they just dragged him away by his ankles. The Monday after Bloody Sunday I was standing outside a factory and, ah, this girl came out and so it's a winter and she cracked off and she scratched on my face and she called me a murderer, you know, spitting on my face. In fact he was (inaudible )at all and the next thing you know I cried, then I was... 

00:27:05
KIM MILLER Right. 

00:27:05
BILLY I got five other bullets and do it on her and, ah, we started-- had to launch this entry and, ah, the crowd start to disperse. But one of the old (inaudible ) hit in the face with his rifle butt. 

00:27:20
KIM MILLER Yeah, so you witnessed that. Did you feel at risk yourself at that time? 

00:27:25
BILLY Christ, yeah, yeah. And I went berserk. 

00:27:25
Week 5 

00:27:30
KIM MILLER The van. We need to make some decision. You're smiling. Why is that? 

00:27:35
BILLY I know what you want to say. 

00:27:40
KIM MILLER Right. What am I gonna say now Billy? 

00:27:40
BILLY You're gonna say greater possible one on the side streets. 

00:27:45
KIM MILLER So when are you gonna do that Billy? 

00:27:45
BILLY Until the weekend. 

00:27:50
KIM MILLER Okay. Why are you putting it off to the weekend? 

00:27:55
BILLY Something tells me you want me to do it tonight. 

00:28:00
KIM MILLER It's not what I want. In a way that's a reassurance you see. So you've still got that there and I think that by-- as I have said to you before, the most important thing is to let go of your reassurances first before you even start doing your targets. So you've still got your van there which is a safety net for you. 

00:28:15
BILLY See, if my van goes, that I'm totally dependent on outside things such as buses, taxis, ah, hospital transport and so on. So, ah, it's in a sense I feel like (inaudible ) feel very, very trapped, isolated. If I was told to leave because of the van, then I would leave-- I wouldn't sort of give in and say, "Well, let's gonna leave the van to someone else. The van is very important to me, uhm, It's my last escape mode. 

00:28:55
VERONIKA HYKS Half way through his treatment, Billy meets Professor Marks and the entire psychiatric team to review his progress. 

00:29:00
ISAAC MARKS Thank you for coming in. 

00:29:00
VERONIKA HYKS Kim's report is positive. He's managed to give up his bodyguards, the mobile phone, even the handcuffs but he clings to the one remaining prop which is undermining his treatment. He can still run back to his van. 

00:29:15
ISAAC MARKS There is one other thing I believe you need to give up so. 

00:29:15
BILLY Motorhome. 

00:29:20
ISAAC MARKS Yup. And, ah, it's not allowed really to be in the hospital grounds. So what are you going to do about that? 

00:29:30
BILLY Well, I did go on to this house and stay to see I'm gonna park this back there but (inaudible ) then all, ah, pretty taken so I'll have to stay with this. 

00:29:40
ISAAC MARKS Ah, I'm afraid not from hospital regulations and so you're gonna have to find somewhere else for it. 

00:29:45
BILLY Yeah. 

00:29:45
ISAAC MARKS So I know you're going to be doing something. 

00:29:50
BILLY I've been told today. Came to me with a (inaudible ). 

00:29:55
ISAAC MARKS So you're going to be doing that today? 

00:29:55
BILLY Yeah. 

00:29:55
ISAAC MARKS Okay. All right, I'm afraid that's a condition of your continuous gamble. 

00:30:00
BILLY Yeah brought it up. 

00:30:00
BILLY The van could jeopardize the rest of my treatment but I really don't give a toast(ph) in a while. I'll leave that van when I feel like it. 

00:30:15
VERONIKA HYKS Billy does not move the van. Instead, he prefers to face the ordeal of a crowded shopping center. 

00:30:20
BILLY the last time I was in a city center like this, it was in 1969. Imagine it's 20-25 years. My palms are sweating, my hands go. I'm feeling I wanna explode. I'm surrounded by potential targets. I feel very uneasy and I just wanna leave. Well I'm thinking of exploding. I gotta get away from this, this situation. I feel a failure really. Normal people don't have to lose situations, still. I wouldn't pat myself on the back of doing so that I'm a normal person. Just thinks most of them. My level of anxiety now is broadened and, and I certainly sort of panic so I wanna get out of here before I panic. I just wanna get back in the (inaudible ). 

00:31:10
[music] 

00:31:10
Week 8 

00:31:15
BILLY Kim wants me to, ah, sit at 11 o'clock. I have a feeling that see myself (inaudible ) and she's been away for 2 weeks so she wanna know what I've been doing for 2 weeks. I happen to be doing the things that I'm supposed to do. 

00:31:40
KIM MILLER Now the only thing that concerns me is what I assume is a problem, otherwise it would be moot as a van which is sitting outside a long cold house. 

00:31:45
BILLY Oh, is it? 

00:31:45
KIM MILLER Really. Is it-- it seems sitting out there. 

00:31:50
BILLY Oh (inaudible ). 

00:31:51
KIM MILLER Yes it is isn't it and what it was last night however you moved it was... 

00:31:55
BILLY No, it still, ah, this morning. 

00:31:55
KIM MILLER Okay. So I think the first step before you even talk about going on the circle on, I'm trying it's that van. 

00:32:00
BILLY Mmm. 

00:32:00
KIM MILLER That van needs to be moved Billy. But I think I'd got to be quite firm now but I think it will just show me total commitment to treatment if you can remove that van and it was also approved that you're ready to take the next step and do the more risky thing that you could but I want you to and I want to help you. I think it's the anxiety, it's the fear. So perhaps now we've talked about it, you need to do it but what I would say Billy is act upon this, what we've talked about soon. If you leave it till five, six, seven in the evening you're gonna keep putting it off. Your anticipation and anxiety will increase and it would impossible or more difficult to do. 

00:32:40
BILLY (inaudible ). 

00:32:41
KIM MILLER All right. 

00:32:45
VERONIKA HYKS Two hours later, Billy finally moves the van but only a hundred yards away to the street outside the hospital. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
BILLY Leaving my van behind feels, ah, right now rather strange. I feel like a child shirt. 

00:33:10
KIM MILLER And do your-- are you gonna leave it there? 

00:33:15
BILLY Yeah. (inaudible ). She doesn't wanna leave it there. I'll be out all the time checking it though security wise. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:25
Week 9 

00:33:30
BILLY I'm starting to feel tired all the time, sort of pissed off. I've been doing things that I haven't done for years like they told me to cry last night, uhm, which is something that I couldn't do last year but I am. Part of me worried that I have to succeed, uhm, I think it's put pressure on me, that I've got to succeed for Prof. Marks and the unit so it's been a pressure on me there. So, ah, what I've been told to do is you say bullocks to me and just try my best. 

00:34:10
[music] 

00:34:10
BILLY (inaudible ) working. 

00:34:20
VERONIKA HYKS The London underground is one of Billy's greatest terrors. Trapped below the surface with no apparent escape, the panic can be overwhelming. It took Billy hours to pluck up the courage to get this far. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN That's a lot. 

00:34:30
BILLY Yeah. 

00:34:30
VERONIKA HYKS Finding it impossible to confront alone, he's brought along a fellow patient for support. 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:34:45
BILLY And my mouth's been dry. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Yeah and it's gone, you're having a the lift. 

00:34:50
[sil.] 

00:34:55
BILLY My ma would say, "If you wanna go ma, just anchor yourself to the, ah, safety." Ah, I'll just press the emergency stop and let the police take me away to the nearest (inaudible ). I was bored and on panic. Just wanting-- dread. Just want to get away from the situation, you know. But actually the problem is, is that I, I was thinking I could get off the next stop but I didn't know where the next stop was and I didn't know where I would be or how to get back to my vehicle now. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN To wait, huh. 

00:35:30
BILLY One of my fucking cramps, there's no crowds. 

00:35:35
BILLY I found it typical that I've done it, you know, and, uhm, going there was harder than coming back. I've never been to the place before and it's-- I don't know how to get out on. It's, it's a panic attack for further, you know, but coming back wasn't as bad. 

00:35:50
BILLY Okay now. Oh, fuck yeah. Fuck me. 

00:36:00
BILLY I'd say it was the hardest so far, yeah. 

00:36:05
[sil.] 

00:36:10
BILLY I'm just surprised that I actually got on the underground. I didn't think I'd do that. It wasn't a nice experience but it, it's an, it's an experience that you're on, you know, with the old memory (inaudible ) say, "But you got on the train that day." So (inaudible ) afraid for the situation. I'll just send you on the train that day and now it gives you courage. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN And we took him out. 

00:36:35
SALLY I came out of Baker Street Station and nobody told me there was three entrances to ba-- three exits, Baker Street. I came out the wrong exit and went down and ended up a mile from Camerontown. Uhm, we did the trip and the things... 

00:36:50
BILLY It was then he triggers there. 

00:36:50
SALLY Oh? 

00:36:50
BILLY And each triggers I think made him scared. 

00:36:55
SALLY Mmm, thousands. 

00:36:55
BILLY Such as? 

00:36:55
SALLY Sherlock Holmes museum. Actually saw 221 with Baker Street and then played just as a Victorian policeman and, ah... 

00:37:05
BILLY Yeah. Has he gone to of the, ah, Jack the Ripper places? 

00:37:10
SALLY No I didn't. (inaudible ). 

00:37:11
BILLY Why is that? 

00:37:15
SALLY I'm too scared to cross the road. I, I, I, I can't believe I actually done the entire-- I didn't plan to do it. 

00:37:20
BILLY Mmm. 

00:37:20
SALLY I'm not being down there for 21 years. I've never been down there at all and the idea of that-- and I-- and the idea of treading on his territory. I mean, I was actually-- I mean do you re-- do you real... 

00:37:35
BILLY Oh, of whose, ah, of whose of his territory? 

00:37:40
SALLY Do you realize I could have been-- do you realized I could, ah... 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN Are you making coffee Martha? 

00:37:40
SALLY Realize I could've been... 

00:37:40
MARTHA I don't want any. 

00:37:45
BILLY What? 

00:37:45
SALLY Do you realize? No, not gonna panic. 

00:37:50
BILLY But if he was okay with it, to cope. 

00:37:50
SALLY Mm-hmm. 

00:37:55
SALLY Well done. 

00:38:00
VERONIKA HYKS Billy goes back to Liverpool again in the van and as usual, at night. The train is still an impossibility. But today, Billy tackles a new obstacle. This is the first time he's felt able to take his daughter out to a public place, the first time he's been to a supermarket for 20 years. 

00:38:20
BILLY I haven't had her with me. It's the first, you know, ah-- she's a lovely kid and, uhm, I won't let her to grow up not knowing that I have a problem otherwise we'll be able to take it out. Take her to the park, take her to (inaudible ), take her to McDonalds and wherever she wants to go without being complications. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Let me go. 

00:38:45
BILLY I don't exactly like this work because (inaudible ) look at the car bay, to see that its full so I know it's gonna be packed on the inside. As I'm walking down there and look at the queues and, ah, I just felt that when I, when it comes to me getting down there that there's, there's (inaudible ). But I'm saying that if Kim was here now with me, she tell me to walk into the biggest kid as practice for the patients and tell them what's wrong. And all the theory is put into practice. It's very painful. 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:25
BILLY I'm glad of coming here today because, ah, it's another notch. Let me just step down going to the galleria. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN My room, sit. 

00:39:40
BILLY Don't wanna help daddy now. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN I wanna drive. 

00:39:40
BILLY You wanna drive? 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:40
BILLY I thought they ever let you do that. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Man. 

00:39:45
BILLY This time I looked what I am doing more to monitor in the bus. You know, that's, that's of course evidence. My relationship with my daughter, uhm, I feel yet that I am becoming closer to her. But that's true, I-- yeah, I'm feeling a lot closer to her. Well I think when you're obsessed with yourself you're obviously thinking about yourself all the time so I think it was the obsessions have dropped a great deal. Then he start to look at things around, ah, at the, you know, sort of things we enjoy. 

00:40:15
BILLY You're gonna drive a wheel yet. 

00:40:15
Week 11 

00:40:20
BILLY This week I just felt like best that I would cry. All week I've been like that. I feel tears welling up and you don't wanna internalize. Just, uhm, what occurs, I don't know. I mean, right now I mean, that's something you'll have to be a million pounds, sort of, ah, excitement. Perhaps you'd often be a motor hole bring as far I'm finish. If I got to do the task we just got no strength the task, I just got no strength, you know. Uhm it's not a depression, it's, it's just tireless. Constantly bloody tired. I can't do it. 

00:41:05
[sil.] 

00:41:10
VERONIKA HYKS The big test, to Liverpool by train but Billy has had to battle with his fears all morning just to get to the station. 

00:41:20
BILLY Once I'm on a train I'm trapped. I can't leave it. Uhm, Perhaps if I try that and fail they might be putting back all together Even if I attempt to approach it, I would, I would feel the anxiety go hard and I wouldn't be able do it. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
BILLY When will I get on this ride? But it won't be today. That's how it is. 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
BILLY I do feel a sense of-- I have not accomplished everything but they're to get another failure. I ge-- I am and I'm not. I'm not working myself with this, this (inaudible ) feeling that I, you know, that I, that I haven't accomplished everything I'm set out to do. So it is, ah, Or I-- I'd like to get on a train, I'd like to go with them but I couldn't do it today. 

00:42:20
KIM MILLER If I'm honest, I'm disappointed for Billy that he hasn't taken the risk, that he hasn't experienced, he hasn't tried to stay there for longer because I believe that if he had, he would get-- be more confident and therefore he would have progressed so much quicker. 

00:42:40
BILLY If I was to do everything, really everything they said I wouldn't have a problem. You know, everybody have-- somebody has to make it on the bottom and get on. It was my problem. I haven't got a problem. I cause a lot of bloody problem. 

00:42:50
Week 14 

00:42:55
VERONIKA HYKS Billy's quality of life has improved. He can now mix more easily with people but his exposure to crowds has been limited. the trips to the city center and the tube were won off events. Discouraged, he contemplates return to an old refuge, an isolated Buddhism monastery in Scotland where he's found solace in the past. 

00:43:15
BILLY I actually look at Ireland people and I think that do I really wanna be part of this. I'm torn between whether I actually wanna be part of the so-called human race or whether I wanna go on living-- live with this monastery. I wonder if life's events take over whether I'll end up going to be a hermit in Scotland. 

00:43:30
BILLY This this realization about the sense of being here. That it's not, it's not the train that's the problem. It's not to boost the problem. The bleeding people, aren't they? That's the problem for me. 

00:43:40
KIM MILLER Yeah. 

00:43:40
BILLY That's the problem for that. You know, I have this fear of failure. 

00:43:40
KIM MILLER And. 

00:43:45
BILLY Which is engraved (inaudible ). Under the fate of these things, there's always the, there's always the fear of, you know what I mean? Yeah. 

00:43:50
KIM MILLER The fear of-- oh, okay. And how could that affect you when you leave here, having these thoughts? 

00:43:55
BILLY Well, the best way not to fail is not to try 

00:44:00
BILLY If I was to go to Scotland and a big sign in the sky said, "You're never gonna see the prayers for the rest of your life." I thought they would be really disappointed. 

00:44:05
Week 15 

00:44:10
KIM MILLER Treatment hasn't been particularly been easy. There actually has been quite a few difficulties. I feel that it is about 35% improved. There are a few problems. He's going to Scotland so this afternoon we're gonna devise a program because I feel that he's going to avoid thing by staying at monastery. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Can I ask why you're keen to go up Scotland? 

00:44:30
BILLY What are you hinting at? You're hinting at, at certain. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Well, I'm hinting at-- I think I'm going out to Scotland is partly avoiding Liverpool. I mean... 

00:44:35
BILLY Mmm (inaudible ). 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN One of the most important things is to continue the program stra-- straight away, not to actually do a kind of major avoidance by going up Scotland. You've actually done very well here. I think the main thing to remember though is that, uhm, just because you're leaving here doesn't mean that the treatment's finished. 

00:45:05
BILLY I actually feel a little bit (inaudible ) This is sorely sort of just doing (inaudible ) wishing these people aren't gonna see you again and they're being quite good. I mean, ah, they mostly say that I'm-- I have a very close friendship with the likes of Sally and, uhm, Alison. You know, we got on great so I'll miss them. And the crew as well, the film crew. They'd be no credit. Pains in the eyes to tell them. 

00:45:30
SALLY Oh. 

00:45:35
BILLY Oh, put it out. 

00:45:35
SALLY It's simply a van and locked doors. 

00:45:35
BILLY This is come-- we have a new, a new motor home. 

00:45:40
SALLY A new motor home, yeah. You open the door, it's locked. 

00:45:40
BILLY Well, the (inaudible ) it's owner. 

00:45:44
SALLY Fully kitted. Even got your fully kitted van. 

00:45:45
BILLY That's so (inaudible ). 

00:45:50
[music] 

00:46:00
BILLY I can see that these obsessions are tied to life events. So part of me says, you know, the next time someone dies, you know, things like that really upsets and get worse. We'll die, I'll never know. Only time will tell 'em. 

00:46:20
[music] 

00:46:35
VERONIKA HYKS Billy has rejected the advice of the Maudsley. He didn't want to settle back in Liverpool where he would undergo a prolonged exposure to his fears. Instead, he's come to Scotland to the Samye Ling Buddhist Monastery near Lockerbie. Here he hopes he'll find the sense of security that he craves. 

00:46:55
BILLY Hi Phil. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:46:58
BILLY How's it going mate. 

00:46:58
UNKNOWN How are you mate? 

00:47:00
BILLY All right. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:47:02
BILLY How do you do mate? 

00:47:02
UNKNOWN It's good to see you. 

00:47:02
BILLY How's things? Nice things. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
BILLY This is the, the temple of Samye Ling. What I like about Samye Ling is that you don't have to be a Buddhist to come here and really, I don't want religion. What I want is the meditation skills and they know that and the guys accept that. So there'd never been any pressure on (inaudible ) a Buddhist as such. Also I respect this place. I mean, what's the point of going to live if I'm going to be miserable. When I can come up free, I'd still do my treatment. I mean, driving these past (inaudible ) I couldn't do that one time. And-- now I don't think I'm avoiding anything. If anything, I think I must be facing it because, ah, when I first come up here I couldn't even sit then. I was scared of the people. You know, to them I can go (inaudible ) do what I want. I could see myself staying here indefinitely. You know, I'm aware that if I stay here it'd be difficult to get back into society so that I will do my treatment every few days or whatever. The thing I ask myself, "Have I ran away?" It could be that I found what I've been looking for and that's just peace and quiet and decent people.
