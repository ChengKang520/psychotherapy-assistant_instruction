ALLEN E. IVEY Welcome, I'm Dr. Allen Ivey, I really want to share some stuff that I worked on for many, many years but, I've also helped more than 50 people, made concrete changes and applications. Students have been exceptionally important in this development and I hope that you'll spot things that you would like to add to improve, criticize or always open to movement and you're gonna see that this is a microskills hierarchy which is built over time, built over time, you're gonna see the foundation skill of attending behavior and let's look at this in more, little more detail now. This is the original counseling skills program. This was the first program to bring video to counseling. Uh… not only is original program, more than a 1,000 universities. There's 20 translations worldwide and is the most research counseling skills program. So specifically, I think it can be helpful to you in this way. First of all, we're going to define specific skills of helping with a big emphasis on listening, listening, listening. Paul Tillich, talked about listening as love and listening is the foundation of love, listening is a foundation of this program. Also you find yourself able to predict client responses in relationship to what you say in the interview. It's not just chance, you can make specific things happen by the way you behave in the interview. It's important to practice immediately. Because this, this videotapes, we're rather proud of and we think can be helpful. But, it's only meaningful if you practice and take the skills home. Practice, practice, practice, that's what makes the difference. It's what you do with this program, how you adapt it, it's gonna make the biggest difference of all. So, you'll be able to assess your competence through the use of this and perhaps, most important empathy, your ability to communicate with interest love and caring for your clients and it is not always as love, sometimes there's tough love, sometimes there's corrective love but, other hand, unless we learn to love and care for our clients, no matter how troublesome they are, we're not going to be able to help them. The more challenging a client, the more we're going to have to find the positive things in ourself to work with others. Well, let's look at what's going to happen in this program. Here's the microscales hierarchy. Notice, the critical emphasis as we listen, is to listen for strengths to build resilience. One of my, anathemas in the counseling and therapy profession is a over emphasis on problems and difficulties. Leona E. Tyler, former president of the American Psychological Association, says in her books and said to me personally, "We don't solve problems from our weaknesses, we solve them from our strengths." And that has been a central focus of my life ever since. So Leona E. Tyler deserves a lot of credit for positive psychology resilience. This, she was one of the first women president of American Psychological Association, a very caring person, a superior scholar, who early on and even in the 1930s was aware of multicultural issues. The microscales hierarchy is based on ethics, multicultural competence, wellness and by the way, now, neuroscience. We'll get a little bit of talk about neuroscience and this is an emphasis in our latest book. But, the first skill that you're going to see a videotape on is attending behavior: appropriate eye contact, body language, vocal tone and verbal following. This will be the first thing in the microskills hierarchy. This is really the basis of listening and empathy. Now, beyond that, I'll show you what happens next, there's a, what we call the basic listening sequence and there we have open and close questions. You're going to see a tape, a video, a D.V.D. of uh… superior counselor showing how to use open and close questions. Again, you'll watch Seria demonstrate open and close questions. You'll have a chance to evaluate it. There's going to be little feedback for you to watch, to see about the strength and weaknesses of open and close questions and then practice, practice, practice. Following that and by the whole process, client observation skills. That's where video comes in. Look at yourself and learn how to observe what's happening with the client. You'll see examples of that, sometimes rewind the tape and look for nonverbal communication. Next comes Carlos Zalaquett with encouraging, paraphrasing, and summarization. These are skills which are very important in cognitive and understanding. A cognitive understanding, very critical in cognitive behavioral therapy and really important of all types but, how does a client think about and make decisions? This occurs in the prefrontal cortex and we work with cognitive stuff, we work with paraphrasing or primary work with the prefrontal cortex. Then we move on to reflection of feeling with Mary Ivey and here we move a little deeper into the brain to the limbic system and here resides the basis of our emotions, the sad, mad, glad, angry and we, if we reflect feeling, we start finding that some of the deeper things that are going on with our client, every cognition is related to an emotion. Jean Piaget once said, there is no emotion without cognition and by the way, no cognition without emotion. One thing is missing from some of C.B. T. therapy, they've missed Piaget's critical statement. Unfortunately, C. B. T now is starting to realize that empathy is basic to getting people to participate in C. B. T and empathy and listening are now increasing and much more central than they used to be seen in some of these more traditional forms of therapy. If you don't listen, not much is going to happen. If you don't have a relationship, you're not much is going to happen. Next is a five stage interview and here we see a relationship repport structuring. We have defining the problem. I don't really like the word problem so much anymore, I really update it defining, start drawing out stories of the clients of their concerns and issues. Think about the problem with the word problem. Problem can be solved and issue, you're always trying to solve and fix something and issue is something we're always going to live with, we're all going to have concerns. Uh… there also is the issue of thinking about defining a challenge. One of the, what's the challenge behind this story. So we're very big into drawing out stories also again focus on strengths to build resilience. Real critical part now of the microskills hierarchy, this is one of the things that is added really since the beginning is strength, positive assets, positive psychology, wellness. We don't solve our problems, our concerns, our issues, our challenges. Why? What's wrong with us? What's right with us? And I would recommend strongly, don't do any, don't continue any farther than this until you identify several strengths in the client. Think about a client, I mean talk to, already, you see they're a little unbalanced and you get, you talk about the problems, that doesn't help them get balanced but you establish a relationship, their feet go to the ground and you're establishing balance and balance is relationship, we want to establish solid relationship with our clients. Uh… once you've gone through the strengths and their issues and I spend, I suggest spending more time on strength than on their issues. Define the goal, if you don't know where you're going, you're likely to end up somewhere else. A lot of counseling and therapy go on with no specific goal. That's a good way to continue with clients over 20, 25 interviews, where the goal is not clear. You can define a goal right from the very beginning. The client will benefit and have specific objectives. Define a goal for that session and later on define goals for the counseling psychotherapy. Counseling and psychotherapy without a goal from my perspective is empty but highly profitable. Uh… fourthly, we move then to basically, brainstorming, explore, exploration, looking at alternatives, finding out what on earth we can do. You're going to see some exploration in my interview. You're also going to see me deviating at times. I'm sorry, uh… and bringing a little bit of feedback, a little bit of interpretation, a little bit of reframing. These are done in the idea of listening first before you bring in any type of influence and skills as such as those. So, watch me in that interview, it's a little grain of salt. Finally, really critical and this is most of us by this time we're tired. Not, I shouldn't have said most of us, many of us are tired and we stop at stage four and we let the client go because the client is tired and we are. This is the most important stage in a way is planning for action, generalization, the action phase of the interview. We need to get specific plans for tomorrow, for next week and as you go on with counseling and therapy, plans for the future. How can we generalize learning? If you don't generalize, nothing's going to happen. You have to help the client plan for the future and use what they've learned but ultimately, you will be aware that difference theories use different skills. Different situations require different skills and different cultural groups respond differently to different skills and actually, we could go back to the microskills hierarchy. A pyramid for building cultural intentionality, a pyramid for building cultural intentionality, each individual that comes to us, comes from a culture. Paul Peterson says, each interview clients, each client that comes to an interview, brings in many voices. Our parents, our family, our community and that's one of the things I'll be demonstrating the many voices that are kind of culture that client brings to an interview. How can we look at each client as a cultural being? There's just, not just white culture, Black culture and so forth, each of us has a unique experiential background and a unique culture. We need to think constantly of multicultural issues along with that of course, comes social justice, equality for all. That's a lot of this, it's about the moral values of our program basic attending skills is listening, being with people and helpful in becoming more of what they are within the cultural social context. 

00:11:30
Attending Skills 

00:11:30
Negative Example 

00:11:30
In this first demonstration, you will see a negative attending example. Notice the counselor's lack of eye contact, body language, and general lack of good attending skills. 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Good morning. 

00:11:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Good morning. 

00:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY How are you today? 

00:11:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I'm okay. How are you? 

00:11:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Good. Uh… what do you want to talk about today? 

00:11:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So… this semester, I've been feeling like very burned out and it's also my last semester of classes so… it's just been like overwhelming in a sense. 

00:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's good that you're almost done then. That's, that's really nice. 

00:12:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN It doesn't seem like it though. 

00:12:10
ALLEN E. IVEY It doesn't. Yeah, but you'll make it, no problem, no problem. How are other, what else is happeninsg besides that? 

00:12:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… that's really like a lot of what's going on now. 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Umm… are you working hard? 

00:12:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:12:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Umm… did you tell me more about what, what's hard for you? Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me a minute here, I'm sorry. Hello, oops! Got to answer, okay, got it. I'm sorry, I'm, I'm wound up right now but I'll call you later sorry. Excuse me, that happens as you know. Uh… so, you've been working hard, you're a little concerned about a few things, what would be the central thing you'd like to talk about today? 

00:13:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… probably just like, trying to manage it all. 

00:13:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm, that's tough. I see, I, I'd like to make some suggestions but what, what you do, you think that works for you? 

00:13:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So I started back exercising that usually seems to work umm… but, it's not like, because of my schedule, it just doesn't feel realistic. 

00:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah I like to exercise too. I, I was at the gym this morning and I actually moved the uh… treadmill up to the highest level I had… 

00:13:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY That's really, that really felt good, it's really nice. What other exercises do you do? 

00:13:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… just like cardio abs, a lot some lifting not a lot like, some lifting. 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You do lifting? 

00:14:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I was doing lifting this morning too and it's kind of hard for me and how about you? 

00:14:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN It's okay, I just use the amount of weights that I need to use. 

00:14:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, that isn't really what it came in the talk about, is it or is it? 

00:14:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No… 

00:14:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Not about it, it didn't come in that, all about exercise? 

00:14:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No… it's more so like trying to… like manage it. So trying to just like, wrap my head around where I'm at right now. 

00:14:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. So, wrap your head around. So, how you've been thinking? 

00:14:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Like, I have some positive thoughts in regards to where I'm at, like I'm excited to be here but then at the same time, it's still very overwhelming. A lot of the times it's just me like, I'm the only one. 

00:14:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, that's not a lot of fun. Well, I think that's bad enough, don't you? 

00:14:55
Attending Skills 

00:14:55
Positive Example 

00:14:55
In this second demonstration, you will see a positive attending example. Look for effective attending behavior including eye contact, forward trunk lean, and maintaining focus on the client and topics. 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hi Dominiqua. 

00:15:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Hi! How are you? 

00:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Thanks for coming in. Before we do anything at all, it's important for me to say, this is being videotaped. If anything happens in here that you don't want to keep doing, we'll stop the tape immediately. 

00:15:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY you're in charge okay? 

00:15:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:15:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, I thought that's most important thing and say at the beginning. Now, I've been looking a little bit about your background and I see that you're from the Bronx. 

00:15:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I see that you're a graduate student in counseling. 

00:15:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:15:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And… it looks like you're heading towards your doctorate and say that's great. Okay, so I kind of know a little bit about you but I also know you came in and we're willing to share something, what's going on. But, before we get to that, uh… I am a white person, you're an African, African American, is that reasonable? 

00:16:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh…How does it feel talking to a person like me? 

00:16:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Pretty comfortable umm… because I'm here like at a P.W. I. [Predominantly White Institution] I'm pretty comfortable with talking to white people in… in my previous experiences so, that's fine. 

00:16:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Are there any questions, you want to ask me? 

00:16:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… no. 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY If there are just do. 

00:16:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

00:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. Uh… I appreciate that. So could you share what you might want to talk about today, I understand you have a concern. 

00:16:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, so there was an incident umm… I was telling you about, how I feel really burned out at this point umm… this, I guess this point in the semester since it's towards the end but, there was a situation where someone that I was working with just kept saying, how articulate I am and it just reminded me of like why, why would you think I would not be articulate as a third year doctoral candidate. 

00:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY As a third year doctoral student they're still saying, ‘my goodness, you're articulate.' I can, I can understand that really, what happened to you when that, when they said you, what was going on inside. 

00:17:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, so it made it very difficult in the moment but I still like, handled the situation well, I would say. 

00:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, what did you do? Just ignored it or… 

00:17:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I just ignored it umm… but then like, when I went home, it was something that kept coming back to me and I kept thinking about it. So, I talked about it with my family as well and some of my friends. 

00:17:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Just a small incident like you know, what we call that, we call that a microaggression and you're familiar with that term? 

00:17:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:17:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Definitely, a microaggression, and unintentional a bit but it's there. 

00:18:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, like it was passed off as a compliment but, it really wasn't because there are other things that could be said about me so. 

00:18:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I can really understand umm…I have a close African-American friend and because of those microaggressions, he says that, any situation he goes into, he feels he needs to be cautious. Does that make sense to you? 

00:18:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, very much so. 

00:18:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's, it's a very real issue. 

00:18:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:18:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I also had a graduate student that she, she could tell the stresses of microaggressions during the week, by the number of phone calls she made home, you know… 

00:18:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, Yeah. 

00:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So that really… 

00:18:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I speak to my family every single day. 

00:18:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So the family supports are really important. 

00:18:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:18:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You know like… 

00:18:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

00:18:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I can understand that, have you run in, you could ever run in the other situation like that? Can you share another one? 

00:19:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… 

00:19:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Maybe when you're younger and particularly painful one. 

00:19:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, when I was younger uh… maybe like in, in undergrad. 

00:19:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Wherever, high school, elementary… 

00:19:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, in undergrad, I would say, there was an incident one time umm… someone that I was working with actually, it was a, it was like a not an R.A. position like, a resident adviser but we worked together umm… as orientation aides. So similar like, helping the students transition like, the new students transition and… 

00:19:35
ALLEN E. IVEY You're working together helping transition, yeah. 

00:19:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. Umm… so, we would hang out in the, you know, on the job and then uh… you know, off the job… 

00:19:45
ALLEN E. IVEY hangout easy relationship. 

00:19:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Right. 

00:19:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

00:19:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, and there was a time when, it was a white male actually. He was like, ‘oh shut up B' and said the B word like, called me a bitch. 

00:20:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh! 

00:20:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, umm… that's something that just like popped up in my head, when we were having this conversation. Uh… so… that was very direct in a sense, and… 

00:20:15
ALLEN E. IVEY very direct. 

00:20:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …and when I said like, do not do that. 

00:20:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Do not do that. 

00:20:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah like that's inappropriate umm… and had a conversation with him. I wasn't. I wasn't composed at that moment, I was… 

00:20:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You weren't composed… 

00:20:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …upset. 

00:20:30
ALLEN E. IVEY …But you were angry inside. 

00:20:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, definitely and like, how I was speaking to him, I was definitely very angry but he was just like, ‘oh, you know, the women that I hang out with like it's nothing to say that' and I was just like I don't know, who you hang out with because I could never see someone else just accepting that. 

00:20:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Even right now, I see a little fire in your eyes. 

00:20:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I'm getting upset… 

00:20:55
ALLEN E. IVEY it's still there. 

00:20:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:21:00
ALLEN E. IVEY It's still there, I can understand. Those movements hang in with this. It's small but they kind of build over time and so that's the type of thing you run into periodically. It's kind of tough to deal with. Uh… so I've got a general picture of your story and the issue. I like to switch just a little bit. I heard you say, Dominiqua, that you dealt with it. Now, how do you deal with that? Could you tell us, how you deal with that? Because that's an important part of uh… the whole issue of living in a society that sometimes gives these racist insults or sexist insults as well I guess. 

00:21:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, yes. Uh… so, just having the conversation or being in spaces where I can talk to someone freely, that has been helpful umm… talking to my friends, our family like, other Black students, saw the students of color that have gone through, similar situations. Umm… but then, even still it's kind of like this idea of, ‘oh you can get over it' like, it's okay, just keep moving but it's like no that's not what I need in the moment. Umm… sometimes… 

00:22:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You need to be listened to. 

00:22:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:22:15
ALLEN E. IVEY It's kind of like, if something happens, we often need just to say, ‘what happened' and then somebody gives you advice, it doesn't work so well. Is that Right? 

00:22:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Right, yeah, yeah. 

00:22:25
ALLEN E. IVEY How did you feel when you talk to people what happened inside when you talk to them and that they didn't quite get it? 

00:22:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN It was frustrating. Umm… and even still like that happens with different situation. So it's like, trying to get the support you need but then not really being able to find it in anyone, so having to find it in myself in a sense. 

00:22:50
ALLEN E. IVEY You see my commitment and working as a counselor is to, the word ‘resilience' you look you have to get a laugh, you look like a very resilient person. Okay and so… 

00:23:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Thank you. 

00:23:00
ALLEN E. IVEY … what is it you have that makes you resilient? Can you tell me some of your strengths? 

00:23:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Some of my strength… umm… I'm usually a very positive person and very optimistic in terms of outlook and supportive of other people. So being able to feel I think, a strength of mine is that I'm able to feel things very deeply. 

00:23:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You feel things deeply. 

00:23:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah. Umm… and like that… 

00:23:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Very empathic. 

00:23:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, yes, very much so. Umm… and like the ability to relate to others and just like have that conversation with them so… 

00:23:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Sound like you got the basis for a very effective counselor. 

00:23:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I hope so. 

00:23:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you tell me just one example of a situation where you were able to do that? 

00:23:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, umm… talking with some of my… some of the women that are in like, my cohort. Uh… some of the situations that they have gone through as being an immigrant student umm… and… trying to navigate academia. Umm… and like relationships with professors and things like that or even in the work studying, on internships and stuff uh… listening to their stories and still being able to connect with them and help them in a sense like, just being there, being present. 

00:24:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I get the sense that, maybe one of your great strengths of resilience is your ability to listen. 

00:24:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:24:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Not bad, not bad, but even if you listen, if you get attacked or still that thing so that business ‘oh my God, there it comes again.' 

00:24:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:24:45
ALLEN E. IVEY One way to deal with that, apparently you've done it is just let it go, that's painful. At the same time, what are some personal strengths you have to, to deal with it, other than letting it go? 

00:24:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Sitting with it. 

00:25:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Sitting with it. 

00:25:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, so… if I'm upset about something then I kind of just sit with that and like, let myself be upset umm… 

00:25:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm going to make an interpretations is that, you've got a pretty strong self concept. 

00:25:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:25:15
ALLEN E. IVEY That helps. 

00:25:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:25:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That helps. Uh… I get a good sense of, where you're coming from. So I heard the microaggression. Uh… one thing we didn't talk about was people, we said last stuff in the media about safe spaces. 

00:25:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:25:35
ALLEN E. IVEY When it actually, a safe space is when you go and talk to friends you can trust. 

00:25:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:25:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And you said that, they tended to be in the African American community. 

00:25:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:25:45
ALLEN E. IVEY And if you're, this is stuff I've picked up along the way, I want to see how accurate I am. 

00:25:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:25:55
ALLEN E. IVEY If you pick that up along the way, uh… it's something to value that safe space and when, when, when they attack with that word, they're missing you. 

00:26:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

00:26:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And so isn't avoidance you're doing was good for you. How does that sound? 

00:26:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN It's true, umm… doing what's good for me. Uh… like really thinking about it like, this is what's good for me in the moment and this moment umm… and allowing myself to do so… 

00:26:25
ALLEN E. IVEY That it gives you strength to go out and deal with it again. 

00:26:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, because it's like you know, it's going to happen again. Well, I know it's going to happen again. 

00:26:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. So, you have a lot of strength and power and that's belief in yourself which is really critical to resilience. Well, we're going to have to stop today for the first interview, you want to give me any comments or questions as we, as we wind up today? 

00:26:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No, I don't have any questions. 

00:26:55
ALLEN E. IVEY What stood out for you from our conversation. 

00:26:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, this is helpful because like, just made enable to talk about it openly. Umm… and hear my thoughts out loud, uh… usually that's very helpful for me so even being here is… 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So you're a good listener and you felt listened to. 

00:27:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:27:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you. Okay, thank you. 

00:27:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Thank you. 

00:27:15
Attending Sessions Debrief 

00:27:15
Allen, Dominiqua, and Seria 

00:27:20
SERIA CHATTERS Hello, Dominiqua and Allen. First of all, I wanted to thank you for that, those wonderful demonstrations of the negative and positive attending skills. So I wanted to ask both of you a few questions on to kind of get a little bit about, how it felt to go through the process? And also get your kind of you know, thoughts as to, how a client may feel or a counselor may feel? So umm… Dominiqua, I want to start with you. So tell me a little bit about, how you felt during the negative attending scale example? 

00:27:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, so I felt uncomfortable… 

00:27:50
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:27:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …because I did not feel like I was being listened to. 

00:27:55
SERIA CHATTERS Um-hmm. 

00:27:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Then he started talking about going to the gym and I was like the focus is definitely not there uh… 

00:28:05
SERIA CHATTERS Yes, yes. 

00:28:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …if anything, it's on the experience of being burned out uh… so far along in the program. Umm… and then… like the microaggression, like dealing with you know, subtle issues that come up so… 

00:28:20
SERIA CHATTERS So it definitely sounds like, you were feeling frustrated… 

00:28:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:28:20
SERIA CHATTERS …Throughout the process? 

00:28:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, yes. 

00:28:25
SERIA CHATTERS So that can, that can be very frustrating if someone, you really feel like someone is not listening to you. 

00:28:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

00:28:30
SERIA CHATTERS So, Allen from the perspective of the counselor, how did you feel through that negative attending scale example? 

00:28:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Interesting, the first word that comes to mind is alienated. Even though, even though I knew was doing it deliberately. 

00:28:45
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:28:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh… definitely did not feel in touch. Uh… and you may have noticed, I had kind of some difficulty in knowing what to say next. 

00:28:55
SERIA CHATTERS Yes, yeah. 

00:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So that was, that was real. That was not played. I mean, when you start screwing up, uh… you get puzzled on what to do? 

00:29:05
SERIA CHATTERS Yes, absolutely. So it sounds like from the client and the counselor perspective, it put distance between the two of you and it impaired the therapeutic relationship. 

00:29:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:29:15
SERIA CHATTERS So… I, I want to switch to a positives uh… the positive side of things because the positive attending skill example seem to go excellently. So from uh… from the client's perceptive Dominiqua, what kind of feelings were you, were going through you and if you could explain a little bit about how you felt during that process of the positive attending scale example? 

00:29:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, so I felt validated, especially when I was talking about the experience of being an African-American woman and having to deal with these microaggressions umm… and then like knowing that he… even though it's not his personal experience, knowing that he was familiar with it… 

00:29:50
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:29:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …and not like knowledgeable of the subject uh… that made me feel like, validated in that moment. So I felt comfortable and I felt like I could share more. 

00:30:05
SERIA CHATTERS Absolutely! So you felt heard and supported. 

00:30:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:30:05
SERIA CHATTERS And from the counselor perspective Allen, tell me a little bit more about how you felt through that positive attending scale example? 

00:30:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Very much in the moment, I really wasn't… thinking a lot about what I was going to say, I just tried to be umm… like Yogi Ram Das says, "be here now." I wanted to be present, the best I could. I didn't consciously think that but in other words, it went very, very fast for me. Umm… in terms of internal feelings, I kind of feel your hurt. I really do and in my own gut. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:50
SERIA CHATTERS So, it felt like the, it sounds to me like the therapeutic relationship was not also enhanced, but there was also a strengthening of that empathic relationship between counselor and client as well. Umm… and I think that, that is something that's absolutely necessary for the entire counseling process. So often times we know that, that feedback is really important in the counseling process from a client perspective and a counselor perspective and sometimes when a counselor may be, let's say doing negative attending skills and they're not aware of it. They may not be able to hear from their client on any advice, you know, as because sometimes what, what happen is the client just doesn't come back. So I would say Dominiqua, if you were to be speaking to a counselor out there umm… what are some things that you think may be a result of a session that is full of negative attending skills from a, from the client's perspective? 

00:31:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would like, I'm sorry umm… I don't think, I have a clear understanding. 

00:31:50
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, well, you know, I could restate the question. So, for instance and if you were in a session and with a counselor and the entire session was full of the negative attending skills, what would be the result? Some of the results of that session from you? 

00:32:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would, so going, moving into the next session. 

00:32:10
SERIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:32:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN If I were to come back like, I would feel like, I would have to be very upfront and say, what was present for me during that time like, I did not feel comfortable, I did not feel supported or listen to umm… or like I don't think that he understood what I was talking about initially so… 

00:32:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, this is what produces client drop out. 

00:32:35
SERIA CHATTERS Yes, yes, absolutely. And I want to go back to that key statement, ‘if I come back' that is really important because it sounds you know, you're speaking from the perspective of let's say, a very assertive client but some clients may not feel assertive and you know, may feel as if they just need to drop out and not come back. So from a counselor perspective Allen, what advice would you have for a counselor in order to kind of regain the ground that they may have lost if they, unless they had a session that was full of negative attending skills. How could they switch it up? 

00:33:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Help! Regaining ground, that's a, that's a toughie. Uh… I think to say, okay, I was looking back at it, last time we got together and I think, I got to tell you, I was not in a good place and I think I was not, not and not helpful and apologies don't help, so I better change. Uh… and maybe better tell me some of your feelings that. Maybe you're feeling, maybe I rewind it, after all I screw up I've done, are you willing to share some of the things you felt about me during that. That I was asking you to be very open but you seem very strong. 

00:33:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, so I would definitely feel comfortable sharing that information with you umm… 

00:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Wouldn't mind shouting at me. 

00:34:00
SERIA CHATTERS That is, that is wonderful because, just as we want our clients to be open and honest you were just open and honest as the counselor said, I was looking back on it and I messed up. So… umm… let's try this again and… 

00:34:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And it got very genuine and… 

00:34:10
SERIA CHATTERS Absolutely! 

00:34:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I'm reminded of my plumber who once said, ‘it's not the mistakes you make, it's your ability to correct them.' 

00:34:20
SERIA CHATTERS Yes, yes. 

00:34:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Nobody can do be perfect, I hope nobody makes the size mistake I did. That, it is they're not going to, you're not going to come back after that, no way. But you will make a little mistakes. 

00:34:35
SERIA CHATTERS Absolutely, and we all make mistakes as counselors and I think that's something important for novice counselors to know that even experience counselors make mistakes as well so absolutely. 

00:34:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

00:34:45
SERIA CHATTERS Well, thank you so much for sharing more about both of your experiences. I really appreciate it. 

00:34:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Great questions. 

00:34:50
SERIA CHATTERS Thank you. 

00:34:55
Open and Closed Questions 

00:35:00
Seria Chatters, PhD 

00:35:00
Penn State University 

00:35:00
SERIA CHATTERS Open and close questions can provide a systematic framework to guide any counseling session and/or interview. Strategic questions, when properly is can open new areas for discussion, clarify and pinpoint issues, help the client with self exploration and also help guide the client through self-awareness. Improper use of questions however, can close your client down, it can also with a novice counselor prevent them from being able to use the basic listening sequence and also cause the client to feel as if they are not heard. Researchers have varying opinions about the use of questions in an interview. Some researchers find that questions are not even necessary whenever providing counseling. However, many other researchers feel that questions are necessary to guide and interview. Questions however when improperly used by a novice counselor can cause the power to shift within the therapeutic relationship. In addition to that, clients have found that when a counselor improperly uses questions that they don't feel as if they're able to properly connect with their counselor. Now, when we're talking about open ended questions, those questions start with words such as, ‘how' or ‘could' or for instance like, open question would be, ‘tell me a little bit more about how you've been feeling? How are you feeling today? Open questions can open up an interview, it can help the client to be able to go deeper into an issue. Close ended questions also have their purpose within an interviewer counseling session. Closed questions can help to direct an interview. It can help to guide an interview and for instance, close down client talk. Now, interestingly enough, an opening quote ended question uh… sentence starters such as ‘why' oftentimes counselors like to use a why question in counseling. However, especially when working with adolescent clients, starting a question with why can often elicit in answer of I don't know. So whenever you're using a why question, you need to make sure that you are explaining the question and also allowing the client to be able to give you an in-depth answer. Thank you so much for your time today and you're getting ready to watch a session with a client and a counselor using closed and open ended questions. 

00:37:30
Closed Questions 

00:37:30
Seria and Kevin 

00:37:30
In this brief demonstration, pay attention to Dr. Chatters' use of closed questions, including "who" and "what" 

00:37:40
SERIA CHATTERS Welcome Kevin, thank you for coming in today. So in our previous intake session, you were telling me a little bit about a break up that you had just experience and that it may be something that you wanted to continue talking about so, I just had a couple of questions about that breakup. So, when did it happen? 

00:38:00
KEVIN About four months ago. 

00:38:00
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, and is it something that you think that, you want to talk about over the next couple of sessions? 

00:38:05
KEVIN Yeah, I think so. Yeah it's definitely the biggest thing on my mind right now. 

00:38:10
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, so who do you think was at fault for the break up? 

00:38:15
KEVIN Umm… we just kind of grew apart, I guess I was really, was really one person. 

00:38:20
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, so… when the breakup happened and umm… you were basically kind of figured out that you and her were no longer going to be together, tell me a little bit more about you know, what exactly you did immediately after the breakup? 

00:38:35
KEVIN I think, I think at first I just like, didn't believe it was actually happening so I kind of just tried to go about my life as normal. Umm… yeah, so I guess I just, didn't really do anything different, continued my days like they normally were. 

00:38:50
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, so do you, do you feel as if, this is something that you know, umm… you're going to be able to get over soon or, or is it going to be something that's going to take a long time? 

00:39:05
KEVIN Umm… I don't know, I think, I, I think, I'll eventually get over it. It's just right now it's, I don't feel like myself just because I, I'm sad. 

00:39:10
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, thank you so much for sharing that information with me. It's really important for me to know those you know, those things before we continue. 

00:39:20
How did Dr. Chatters' use of closed questions affect her conservation with her client? 

00:39:30
Open Questions 

00:39:30
Seria and Kevin 

00:39:30
In this brief demonstration, pay attention to Dr. Chatters' use of open questions, including "how", "could", and "for instance" 

00:39:35
SERIA CHATTERS Hello Kavin, thank you so much for coming in today and in our previous session you were telling me a little bit about a breakup that you had experienced and that sounded like it was really upsetting. So, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what happened? 

00:39:55
KEVIN Umm… I guess, it was a long distance relationship. So uh… we just, we would talk pretty frequently but we didn't see each other a lot. I think I end up going off to school and we just kind of grew apart and it felt like… and around we were in is frequent contact with each other and then it was almost never and then eventually just kind of this doesn't, this isn't working. 

00:40:15
SERIA CHATTERS Um-hmm. So it sounds like things kind of naturally fell away. So you say that, you are feeling sad. Tell me a little bit more about that sadness explain it to me? 

00:40:30
KEVIN I think it's like a feeling of like, I don't know what I did or if there was anything I could have done differently. So it's kind of like rethinking everything and being like, where did it, where did it go wrong? Right and then, I think I'll start thinking like, well, maybe it's something about me or am I inadequate or something I couldn't make her happy and then, I don't know it just kind of, it doesn't, it just feels crappy. 

00:40:55
SERIA CHATTERS Yeah, yes. Well, break ups, they feel horrible because it's a part of your life, a person that you had in your life and they were part of everything and now they have dropped away so it's kind of like losing a limb so to speak. 

00:41:05
KEVIN Yeah. 

00:41:05
SERIA CHATTERS So, I want to go back and explore something that you said, you said that you have all of these feelings running through you. Was it you? Is there something that you could have done differently? Let's explore that a little bit more so, what is it that you feel that you could have done differently? 

00:41:20
KEVIN I think, I got comfortable with it being long distance so, I wouldn't like make a time for it because it was like, not on the backburner but it wasn't in the forefront of my mind because I had a lot of stuff in my immediate kinda environment going on. So, I think I should have made a better effort to make it part of my daily like, to make her part of my daily routine and, and not take for granted the fact that we were together. 

00:41:50
SERIA CHATTERS Right, so let's say that you did that. What do you think the result may have been? 

00:41:55
KEVIN I don't know, I mean, I imagine we'd probably still be together but I don't, I don't know because, because there was also, it wasn't just me. You know, there was also, she didn't make me a part of her daily routine either so… 

00:42:10
SERIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:42:10
KEVIN …I'm not sure what it would be? 

00:42:15
SERIA CHATTERS Because relationships are two way streets right, so even if you may have changed, if things may not have changed on her end, things could be different and could not be different. 

00:42:20
KEVIN Yeah. 

00:42:25
SERIA CHATTERS So you said that, you have been thinking a little bit about could, are there some things about yourself that you could have changed and you know, I, I am a person, I believe that with every experience we can learn something umm… and so it maybe some things that you couldn't change but what are some things that you have learned from this experience, this relationship? 

00:42:45
KEVIN I think, that's a good question. I think being willing to open up, I think I'm pretty guarded emotionally, I don't talk a lot about how I'm feeling so sometimes our conversation, she'd try to probe more of like, how I was feeling, I just was like, I'm fine. So, I think one of the things I learned is just, I don't know, opening up more letting myself be vulnerable but I don't know if I actually, would actually do that or it's easy to say but umm… because right now… 

00:43:15
SERIA CHATTERS But you're doing it right now. 

00:43:20
KEVIN Yeah and it's… 

00:43:20
SERIA CHATTERS You're doing it right now. Yeah, so something that you learn from the relationship, first of all, you're in this office right now and you're talking to this person that you've only met for an intake session this is our second session and you're telling me how sad you feel so it sounds as if you're actually acting on some of those things that you learned. 

00:43:40
KEVIN Just wish I had like, a way to go back in time right and know it before so it wasn't where I am now you know. 

00:43:45
SERIA CHATTERS Absolutely! But the interesting thing about, about things in life sometimes is those life lessons sometimes can prepare us for the future but feeling sad right now is a good thing and I don't, I want to be careful in saying that because you're feeling something and this is something that you said previously you may not have felt. So in the sadness, I want to ask you, how has the sadness been affecting your everyday life in your every day functioning? 

00:44:10
KEVIN I think is just like it's always an underlying feeling so I'm, I don't think my behavior is like, I don't do anything differently I don't like, I just feel it's always there so everything just kind of has like a tent of sadness to it like I feel like, I don't enjoy things as much as I did. 

00:44:25
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:44:30
KEVIN umm… I feel like, I pretty much do the same things but I just, it's always present with me and I'm always thinking about I feel like I'm kind of, in my own head a lot more as a result. 

00:44:35
SERIA CHATTERS So how long have you been feeling this way post breakup? 

00:44:40
KEVIN I think it started probably, about a week after the breakup is when I realized it was going to be permanent umm… and it's been about four months. So probably, that whole time it's been about four months of feeling like, I'm not quite there, I'm not quite myself like I used to be. 

00:45:00
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, okay, and have you had any contact with her? Umm… post breakup? 

00:45:05
KEVIN I have, we still text. So, I think that's part of it because there's still somewhat of a connection but it's, I know it's not the same as it was so there's still like our relationship not like a romantic relationship. 

00:45:15
SERIA CHATTERS Right, so what are your hopes for where things will be let's say four months from now? For you and how you feel? 

00:45:25
KEVIN Yeah. I think, I want to feel like myself like I want to feel like, I'm excited to you know, go out with my friends and stuff like that so, I think I want to be okay being alone. 

00:45:35
SERIA CHATTERS Okay, okay, that's an excellent goal for counseling and that's something we can work on here together. Thank you so much for sharing this with me Kevin. This is definitely a journey that we can take together. 

00:45:50
KEVIN Thank you for listening. 

00:45:55
How did Dr. Chatters' use of open questions affect her conservation with her client? 

00:46:00
Open & Closed Questions Debrief 

00:46:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Seria, Kevin, thank you for letting me sit in with you. I'd like to know a little bit about how things went for you during the session. Uh… first of all Kevin, how are, how was it for you during the close questions? 

00:46:20
KEVIN I felt like a, like a firing squad almost. 

00:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY A firing squad. 

00:46:20
KEVIN Yeah. 

00:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh no! 

00:46:20
KEVIN Just one right after the other. Umm… there were times I thought, I couldn't answer the question fully before she jumped in with another question. 

00:46:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You really didn't feel too heard. You just boom, boom, boom. 

00:46:30
KEVIN Yeah like a checklister. Yeah. 

00:46:35
ALLEN E. IVEY How was it for you? 

00:46:35
SERIA CHATTERS It was uncomfortable. Umm… it was really uncomfortable because it felt like, before I knew it, I was coming time for me to have to ask another question because they, close questions provides such little time for feedback… 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Force you to think or do you think. 

00:46:50
SERIA CHATTERS Right, exactly, yeah. 

00:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It was a time Seria, where you slipped and ask kind of a open question. You recall that? Could you remember what you said? 

00:47:00
SERIA CHATTERS I don't remember what I said but I do know that I slipped and I asked one and it actually allowed him to talk a little bit more and I think that it was so difficult to stay on those close questions because I did you know, I naturally wanted to know more so… I, I did, I, I do remember I said that was an open question, that wasn't a close question. 

00:47:20
ALLEN E. IVEY In a way that, illustrates it all more clearly, the difference between the two. 

00:47:25
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:47:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Do you recall that open question? 

00:47:25
KEVIN I don't. 

00:47:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You don't uh… you felt mainly, at the end of the firing squad. 

00:47:30
KEVIN Okay, that's appropriate. 

00:47:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, how was that with, how was it for you when she took open questions and spent more time drawing out your story? 

00:47:40
KEVIN It was awesome. Yeah, I liked it a lot. I felt really hurt and I, she also before she'd ask a question, she kind of like paraphrase what I had said and it was like yes. That's exactly it and then I can kind of go deeper so, I felt like there were check ins along the way and I knew she was like, following me. 

00:47:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So it wasn't just a question, it was also the follow up to show that she heard you. 

00:48:00
KEVIN Yeah. 

00:48:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Wasn't question, question, question, it was she could build along that question. Okay, what might you have, did you learn anything new in that particular set of open questions and… 

00:48:10
KEVIN Umm… I think, the importance of allowing space because there were times where sometimes I wouldn't know how to answer the question and rather than trying to like clarify or say it differently she just let me have space which was really nice umm… because I could kind of just explode, okay, how do I want to say this? How do I want to answer this? I thought that was a really umm… yeah, I like that. 

00:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So, we got the story out. Thank you. How about you? How did you feel in the opening question? What was going on for you? 

00:48:35
SERIA CHATTERS It felt like a real counseling session umm… and I felt that I was able to sit back, relax and work on connecting with my client and really getting a good understanding of his story and what he wanted out of the counseling process as well. 

00:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, the open questions are really a great way to draw out the client story. 

00:49:00
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY At the same time, as you know some theoreticians object to the use of questions at all. 

00:49:05
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:49:05
ALLEN E. IVEY What are your thoughts about that Seria? 

00:49:05
SERIA CHATTERS Well, I would be on the side of umm… actually for some open questions. Especially, I tend to like, cognitive therapy and cognitive therapy I believe uses quite a few questions to kind of guide the session. Umm… I do understand from a person centered perspective and also using that just you could actually do an entire session just using the basic listening sequence for instance and not really getting too deep into questioning but, umm… I feel as you move forward into using more specific therapeutic interventions that questions are necessary so… 

00:49:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I also was you know, a shout out for close questions to sometimes those close questions that there's not bang, bang, bang, shotgun. 

00:49:55
SERIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:49:55
ALLEN E. IVEY But bring out very important specifics. The other thing is happens for me at times is, I may ask a close question by happened to hit the client just right, it acts just like an open question right. Now, that's, that also happens, I thought that was a terrific demonstration of the, of the two skills. I appreciate your participation and feedback and good luck and thank you both. 

00:50:15
SERIA CHATTERS Thank you.

Empathic Encouraging, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing 

00:50:25
Carlos P. Zalaquett: PhD 

00:50:25
Taylor Bigelow, 

00:50:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Empathic encouraging paraphrasing and summarizing are active listening skills that communicate to the client that they have been heard. They also help the client expand, distill, or clarify what they have said. This clarification leads to more effective executive functioning, which in turn leads to improve cognitive understanding, organization of issues and decision making. Without organization of their stories, clients will continue to leave in indecision and confusion. This listening skills are the cognitive center of the basic listening sequence and our key in building the empathic relationship. When clients sense that their story is heard, they open up and become more ready for change. Encouraging uses verbal and nonverbal expressions to prompt clients to continue talking. Encouragers include minimal verbal expressions such as, um-hmm and ah-huh, head nods, open handed gestures and possibly facial expressions. A restatement is an extended encouraging in which you repeat short statements two or more words excitedly as used by the client such as, you had trouble getting along on your last job. Paraphrasing is slightly more complex than encouraging. It covers more of what the client as just said usually, several sentences. Paraphrasing catches and distills the essence of what the client has said and helps clarify a confusing story. An accurate paraphrase usually consist of four dimensions. First, a sentence stem sometimes using the client's name or the specifics of the situation. For example, "Janet, I hear you saying..." or "Luciano sounds like.." or "looks like the situation is..." and you complete then the sentence with what? With the second main element keywords, key words used by the client to describe the situation or person. It may include main ideas and some of the exact words that come from clients. For example, John, your concern about your daughter who wants to work even though you give her a good allowance and you have had a terrible argument. The essence of what the clients has said in briefer and clearer form is the third element. Identify, clarify and feedback the client sometime confused or lengthy talk into succinct and meaningful statement. Last number four, a checkout for accuracy, or what is sometimes referred to as perception check. Here, you ask the client for feedback on whether the paraphrase was correct and useful? Is this right? Did I hear you correctly? Are examples of check out. Of course, checkouts are useful with all the kills. Summarizing encompasses a longer period of conversation than paraphrasing. At times you may cover an entire interview or even issues discussed by the client over several interviews. In summarizing, we attend to verbal and nonverbal comment from the client over a period of time and selectively attend to key concepts and dimensions, restating them for the client as accurately as possible. Of course, a checkout at the end for accuracy is a key part of summarizing. Clients will feel heard and discover how their complex and even fragmented stories are integrated. This summary helps clients make sense of their lives and facilities are more centered and focus discussion. The summary also provides a good transition from one topic to the next or may provide a way to begin and end a full session. Remember that accurate empathy, listening skills meaning, Accurate Empathic Listening Skills are not that common nor as easy as it may sound, but they have a profound effect. Listening is a communication process that requires intentional participation, decision making and responding. What we listen to and respond to greatly influences how clients talk to us about their concerns. When a client shares with us a lot of information all at once and talk very rapidly, we confine our self confusion, even overwhelmed by the complexity of the story. We need to hear the client accurately and often slow the narrative down a little. So in a sense, our accurate listening in turn leads to client understanding and synthesis providing clients with a clearer picture of their own stories. What you will see next is the demonstration of the leasing skills of encouraging, paraphrasing, summarizing and check outs. That begin with a negative demonstration but be very careful because that demonstration begins with a great summary. So pay attention and then follow with the positive demonstration.

Negative Example of Encouraging, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing Carols and Taylor 

00:56:30
Summary of previous session and homework completions. 

00:56:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Taylor, good to see you again, glad that you came back. 

00:56:30
TAYLOR Thank you. 

00:56:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT I am also, I'm glad to hear that you were able to complete the homework we discussed last time and but, I remember that by the end of the last session, you mentioned that you had some sort of a secret something that you wanted to share that you, you haven't talked to anybody about that, tell, tell me about that. 

00:56:55
TAYLOR Absolutely! So, last week we talked about you know, just, what brings me and we don't really get to it umm… and I'm here really because I'm struggling with umm… you know, my major in figuring out what I want to do. I came into college thinking you know, I really want to be a bio chemistry major and upon starting school, I got into my chemistry classes and into my biology classes and I'm just realizing I really don't like them. Umm… so my freshman year you know, now I'm a junior and I'm really just stressed and concerned that it's not really what I want to do anymore. 

00:57:30
Negative use of closed-ended questions. Critical tone invalidates client's story/experience 

00:57:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So you don't want to be a bio major? 

00:57:30
TAYLOR Exactly, yeah, I don't think I wanna be… 

00:57:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT What kind of biology major do you, did you mention? 

00:57:35
TAYLOR Umm… biochemistry. 

00:57:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT A biochemistry, you don't like chemistry either? 

00:57:40
TAYLOR No, so I'm realizing, I think I want to switch my major to, you know, just a different field to be in the helping professions. Originally I thought I wanted to maybe be a medical doctor and I'm realizing that's just not the path for me. Umm… so I'm thinking about like, maybe social worker counseling or psychology instead. 

00:57:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Okay, chemistry is not the path for you? 

00:58:00
Questions with invalidating tone. 

00:58:00
TAYLOR Umm… it's not the best. No. 

00:58:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT What's wrong with bio chemistry? 

00:58:05
TAYLOR Umm… I'm just realizing, I don't like working in a lab. It's not what I expected it to be. I come in and currently I'm working in a botany lab where I'm pipetting algae and it just doesn't feel like the best way to help people. I wanted to be a biochemistry major to go to med school. Everyone suggested that's the best way to get there is to start with really… 

00:58:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT You wanna go to med school? 

00:58:25
Questions again - interrupt and invalidate. 

00:58:25
TAYLOR Yeah, to start with the hard major to get into med school umm… and I just really don't like it but I'm a junior now and I'm realizing it's kind of late in the game to change my major and I'm just feeling, you know, I haven't told anybody about it because I'm feeling kind of like I don't belong or people won't believe me that it's the right decision. I just feel really confused about where to go and I think my parents would be really upset if I changed my major this late in my academic career. So, I'm really concerned about that. 

00:58:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So you feel confused and what about medical school? 

00:58:55
Attempt to reflect, but quickly turn into a question. 

00:58:55
TAYLOR Umm… yes, I wanted to go to medical school umm… but I don't anymore. I thought, I wanted to go and work as maybe like an O.B.G.Y.N. like, deliver babies and work with families and women's health. Umm… but right now, it just doesn't feel like, my major is getting me there. It's really frustrating and I just feel really lost. 

00:59:10
Counselor again misses an important feeling and questions client instead. 

00:59:15
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, you don't want to continue study by your chemistry major and you don't wanna go to medical school either? 

00:59:25
TAYLOR Yeah, like I said before, I really I don't think that's the best path for me. I think, I'd rather be in a different helping profession like counseling or psychology or maybe social work, something like that. 

00:59:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So you're thinking about a different profession. 

00:59:35
TAYLOR Yes. 

00:59:40
Counselor continued use of questions: missing clients experience. 

00:59:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT How about your grades? 

00:59:45
TAYLOR Umm… it's also the other part and that's part of the secret too is my grades aren't great. So… umm… in high school I did really, really well at things like biology and chemistry so, I thought oh cool. So I'll be a great major and then when I got started freshman year was okay, I got you know, decent grades and then sophomore year I wasn't doing so well in things like bio chemistry or solid molecular biology. Umm… Now my G.P.A. is pretty low. 

01:00:10
Counselor passes major judgment on client's skills without evidence 

01:00:10
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So you, you realize that you don't have enough study skills to do well on chemistry and maths. 

01:00:15
TAYLOR Umm… I don't know, if it was study skills. I think, I'm just not interested in it so, I haven't been trying as hard as I might, what something I do find is really interesting. 

01:00:30
Carlos implies that client may have a learning disability 

01:00:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT But your great are low. 

01:00:30
TAYLOR Yes, my grades are low. 

01:00:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Have you done any testing to see… if you have any math issues or any difficult skills on that prospect? 

01:00:40
TAYLOR Like, taking a test to see if I'm like, good at math? 

01:00:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

01:00:45
TAYLOR No, I haven't. Is that something you think I should do? 

01:00:50
In spite of any evidence counselor insists that client gets tested 

01:00:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yeah, why don't we schedule that for our next session and then we'll talk about that because I'm really concerned about your willingness to change careers. But, if you're not good at math, uh… well, that could be a problem. 

01:01:05
TAYLOR It could be a problem that I'm not good at math? 

01:01:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

01:01:05
TAYLOR Even if I change my major? 

01:01:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Um-hmm. 

01:01:05
TAYLOR Like, as if you say so. 

01:01:10
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Good, let's skill you that for next time. 

01:01:10
TAYLOR Okay. 

01:01:15
The negative example illustrates a profoundly negative interaction between a client who is trying to decide what's best for her career, and a counselor who insists on "blaming" the client, suggesting she may suffering from a learning disability. The concerns and emotions expressed by the client are systematically questioned, criticized, and invalidated. Client is not heard nor encouraged to explore her issues. 

01:01:40
Positive Example of Encouraging, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing Carlos and Taylor 

01:01:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Taylor, good to see you again. 

01:01:45
TAYLOR Good to see you again. 

01:01:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Welcome back. 

01:01:45
TAYLOR Thank you. 

01:01:55
Summary of previous session 

01:01:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Uh… so, I remember you working on your homework and I, I'm glad to umm… see that you brought your homework with you, we just review it. How did it go? 

01:02:00
TAYLOR It went really well, I felt really supported as we went through the homework assignment together and glad we were able to talk about a little bit. Umm… but there's actually something else I was really hoping to get you today and talk about. 

01:02:15
Summary and invitation to explain new issue 

01:02:15
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very well, since we really cover our first part, this would be a very good time to discuss something uh… that is important to you. 

01:02:20
TAYLOR That sounds really great. So, I guess, I'll just start from the beginning and give you a whole picture. Umm… so I am currently a junior in college. 

01:02:30
Restatement 

01:02:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT A junior in college? 

01:02:35
Non-verbal encourager 

01:02:35
TAYLOR Yes and I started umm… you know, freshman year as a bio chemistry major and I'm currently a bio chemistry major. So, in high school I was really, really good at my subjects of biology and chemistry and when I was looking at colleges I thought, hey that would be a great place to start. I was thinking I wanted to go into medical school maybe, you know, help people that way. Umm… so, I picked this major. I heard from other people that that's the, it's a challenging major, it's a good place to start if you do want to pursue a difficult degree like a medical degree. Umm… so I picked it and I've been in it for two and a half years umm… and I'm just finding, I really don't like it as much as I thought I did. Umm… the classes are really challenging, I'm finding my grades aren't as good as they used to be and I'm just feeling really lost because I think, I want to switch my major. 

01:03:20
Paraphrase 

01:03:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So… you went to bio chemistry as a stepping stone to medical school. 

01:03:25
TAYLOR Yes. 

01:03:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT But now after a year or two into that path, you, you don't feel that it is the path for you. 

01:03:30
TAYLOR Exactly, like, I'm feeling like, it's too late to switch but I really just don't think, it's right for me. I feel like I'm just kind of going through the motions. 

01:03:40
Restatement 

01:03:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Going through the motions. 

01:03:40
TAYLOR Yeah, for instance, I work in a lab right now where it's a botanical sciences lab. So, I work with algae and plants umm… but I don't get a lot of interaction with people and the work is not related to med school at all. So, I'm working with plants like, I guess that could maybe be related like pharmacy or something but it has nothing to do with medical science or pre medical science. 

01:04:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Um-hmm. 

01:04:00
TAYLOR So I'm just feeling like, I'm just going through the motions of this. 

01:04:05
Summary 

01:04:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, the medical sciences and the biochemistry are not longer as appealing to you? 

01:04:15
TAYLOR Umm… yeah, I mean the helping people part is appealing to me but you're right, yeah, you said it really well like, they're just not what I was hoping for that is appealing. 

01:04:20
Paraphrases client's goal 

01:04:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT But you still would like to help people. 

01:04:25
TAYLOR Yes, I think this in a different way. So, I've been looking at like, a psychology major for instance, to maybe pursue like you know, counseling degree or social worker like, clinical psychology something like that. Umm… but there's some pressure from my family too because they're helping me pay for my undergraduate degree and they were really hoping I would go to medical school. So I'm just feeling like I'm keeping a secret but I'm unhappy and again just like I'm going through the motions of this work when I really don't like it as much as I thought I would. 

01:04:55
Summary of the way the clients feel 

01:04:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So if I understand you correctly, you are now clearly in a change of heart or position regarding your career. 

01:05:00
TAYLOR Yeah. 

01:05:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT But you are concerned about, how your family will take the situation. 

01:05:05
TAYLOR Yes. I'm extremely concerned about, how they'll react because I think for them like, me being a doctor like aspiring to that was a big deal for them too umm… and I want to honor that but it's just not what I want to do anymore. I would still want to help people but just not in that way. 

01:05:25
Restatement 

01:05:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT You do want to help people but in different ways. 

01:05:25
TAYLOR Yes. 

01:05:25
Encourager "Tell me more" 

01:05:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Tell me about the, the different ways. 

01:05:30
TAYLOR Yeah, so, I took a psychology class as part of umm… just like an extra class to see if I liked it before I potentially switch this late in the game umm… and it was just, it was an intro to psychology and you learn about all the different helping professions and how you can still help people but not in a medical way, you can help their mental health. Currently, I'm interning at a counseling center like I just, I volunteer in some shelters and I'm doing some work for like women's resource centers and I'm just finding, I really enjoy that work, working with other people but then when I'm in the lab working on you know, the studies in the research that we're doing there's nobody. There's nobody there. So, I'm just feeling really isolated and like the contrast of volunteering and helping people and interning versus working in this research lab. I just don't find it as appealing. 

01:06:15
Summary 

01:06:15
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, you, you're not longer really interested in a career, in a lab nor in the medical field. You are looking into mental health, where it is psychology counseling social work. 

01:06:25
TAYLOR Yeah, that's exactly right. 

01:06:30
Good use of questions 

01:06:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT And among those options, any particular one that seems interesting to you because you are doing an internship, is that helping you decide? 

01:06:35
TAYLOR Yeah, I kind of, so I'm an intern in a counseling center and we do like outreach. Umm… so it's like that's like health promotion. So like, still has it's kind of the, the place couples with like um, with P. A's and medical doctor so, it's mental health counselors and doctors together working to like, promote health across the college campus. So I like both of those aspects. So, I'm not really sure where I want to go, I just don't think it's possible for me to be a doctor. So I'm kind of letting go of that dream umm… but I think probably some clinical work like I, may be clinical mental health counseling or something like that. 

01:07:10
Paraphrase followed by a check-out to assess accuracy 

01:07:10
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So Taylor, I think, I understood you umm… in the sense that you, you really don't want to pursue your bio chemistry, make over path, you really want to find an alternative way to work helping people. We talk about some options. Am I understanding you correctly? 

01:07:25
TAYLOR Yeah, you are. I think figuring out what that next steps are going to be is going to be really important. 

01:07:35
Paraphrase of key aspects of client's concern 

01:07:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Which is wonderful to hear but at the same time you did mention that you were very concerned about letting your parents know, letting your mom and dad that you are not longer pursuing… 

01:07:45
TAYLOR Yeah. 

01:07:50
Encouraging 

01:07:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT …a career that they were hoping you will pursue. Tell me little bit more about that. 

01:07:55
Encourager 

01:07:55
TAYLOR Yeah, so I come from pretty humble means. It took a lot for my parents to invest in my education and I've been really grateful and appreciative of that umm… and I know their hopes were for me to become a medical doctor, have a doctor in the family. Umm… so for me to come to them and say, actually, I think I'm going to switch my major and do something completely different. I think they're going to be shocked and surprised and I don't know how they'll quite react to that. 

01:08:20
Restatement 

01:08:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT It would be a shocking surprise and you don't know how they will react. 

01:08:20
TAYLOR Exactly yeah. I just don't know if they'll, if they'll continue to support me, if they'll be proud or excited or have a lot of questions. Probably, all of those things but I'm worried that they could act anger, out of anger and feel disappointed or I don't know like I'm letting them down. 

01:08:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So your concern about them, becoming disappointed and also you letting them down. 

01:08:40
TAYLOR Um-hmm. 

01:08:45
Summary and acknowledgment of client strengths 

01:08:45
Asset search or skill to address client's concern with parents 

01:08:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Okay, that those are important feelings on important issues to talk about also. But on the other hand I do feel and have to say this to you, this is a very difficult decision and I get the sense that it took a lot of strength just to bring it to the conversation here because this is a difficult moment in your life. But on the other hand, you have the strength to really address this. Umm… what other strength do you have that may help you in engaging in this conversation with your parents? 

01:09:20
TAYLOR Well, I appreciate you saying it so straight because right now it doesn't feel that way I'm really nervous about it. Umm… I guess, the strength is coming here and this is my first time in counseling because it feels like, I need that support and this it's also like you know, saying goodbye to a dream which is a big deal. Umm… but I guess another strength is just being vulnerable and taking a risk and talking with you about this, it's really hard for me. 

01:09:45
Non-verbal encourager, restatement, and check-out 

01:09:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Being vulnerable and speaking about it that is a strength. Am I understand you well. 

01:09:50
TAYLOR Yeah. 

01:09:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very good. 

01:09:50
TAYLOR Hopefully, you feel the same way. 

01:09:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yes. 

01:09:55
TAYLOR It feels like a strength. 

01:10:00
Summary on possible options and plans to move forward towards client's goal 

01:10:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yes actually, I feel the same way. Now, this is what I will suggest. So on one hand, we need to talk about what to do and what would be sort of the best way for you to use those strengths to speak with your parents about this. That's an important conversation to have. On the other hand, we also need to engage in discussion about what alternative plans, then you can engage in and it could make sense that we will discuss about the options. So you will have a better plan to offer to your parents. So they will understand that even if you're not going for the initial option you still have a viable plan and a reasonable way to move forward. 

01:10:40
TAYLOR Um-hmm, that's definitely the hope. It's just to have my ducks in a row, so if they have any questions, I can say here's the answer to that question and hopefully calm their nerves a little bit as well as my own. 

01:10:50
Paraphrase 

01:10:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT It makes a sense, you would like to have a plan and have a way to calm down your own nerves and I think that that's what we should be working on decisions ahead. 

01:11:05
TAYLOR it sounds really great. 

01:11:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very good. We'll do it. 

01:11:05
TAYLOR Cool. 

01:11:10
Encouraging, Paraphrasing and Summarizing Debrief Carlos, Taylor and Allen 

01:11:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Hey, you two, that was a fabulous demonstration of the positive and the negative. Really, crystal clear, I've really enjoyed watching you. Let's debrief first, the uh… the negative one, less positive one. How was that for you? 

01:11:35
TAYLOR It was really uncomfortable for me. 

01:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I see. 

01:11:40
TAYLOR Yeah, I felt like I wasn't being heard as well as in the other vignette, but this was, it was just uncomfortable. I don't have a better word than that. He wasn't hearing me out and I felt like I was repeating myself a lot. It was uncomfortable for sure. 

01:11:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It was very interesting to watch you cause you kept going no matter how bad he got. 

01:11:55
TAYLOR I think, it might have been nerves trying to fill the space. 

01:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I see, it's sort of… 

01:12:00
TAYLOR Like, he's not gonna say something, I'm going to say… 

01:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You're taking care of the counselor. 

01:12:05
TAYLOR Um-hmm. 

01:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Really, so really, it was kind of uncomfortable, but you helped him. You hoped that by making him more comfortable things will be better for you. That's interesting, I bet you that happens a lot in counseling. How was that first one for you Carlos? 

01:12:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT That-you know, I have to say this. It's much easier to do the negative demonstration than the positive demonstration always. Because we can really mess up pretty easily but, we have to be very intentional in the way we do demonstrations. So, I'm trying to be negative and as you said, my client Taylor is trying to help me out to get it right. I still wanted to say, no, I'm not really buying your story, you are afraid of math and sciences and you are in a sense, the innuendo was maybe, you have a difficul- a lack of competency and you need to look into that before you make any decisions and obviously, that was not the case because she even mentioned in the negative segment that, she did good in high school in math and chemistry and I still insisted that they may be some sort of like, competency lagging. 

01:13:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So you also indicate you weren't listening well. 

01:13:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Well, now we are processing from our perspective taking thing out, but in reality that in session, you are not listening. You are really, even when you are paraphrasing or summarizing, you are adding your own slant into it. Instead of helping the client, get a clearer picture and a better understanding of self, the counselor is imposing. He saw her worldview in this case my take on whatever was happening to you, as opposed to understanding, how did it happen to you? 

01:14:00
TAYLOR Um-hmm. 

01:14:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Did that sound similar to what you… 

01:14:00
TAYLOR Absolutely! I felt it and when Dr. Zalaquett suggested, I take a test for my intelligence in my mathematics. I was really offended but also didn't know how to respond to it and I was like, what does he think I'm you know, unintelligent, or not capable and again I was really, really uncomfortable. 

01:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Let's move to the positive interview. How did that go for you? 

01:14:25
TAYLOR Much better, umm… it felt like he was really listening to what I was saying, I remember hearing myself say like, ‘oh you've got it' it's totally right you're hearing you're hearing me and you know where I'm coming from and I felt really supported when Dr. Zalaquett would chime in and paraphrase it correctly umm… and it didn't really feel like you were putting your slant on it, I felt like you were just hearing me out for what I was really trying to, to say. 

01:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I think a good example of what is going right in a, in a paraphrase or reflection of feeling, when the person comes back and says exactly, ‘aha, you've got it' and that's a good measure. If you don't got that as a counselor, you're probably not fully with them. It's very common to see what you did with him, that was not planned, that just happened. 

01:15:05
TAYLOR Um-hmm, no, it was not planned. You really got what I was saying which is, it felt good. 

01:15:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Exactly, I feel you really got it. 

01:15:10
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Exactly. 

01:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, how is that for you? 

01:15:15
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT It, it feels much, like, being in a happier place. In other words you're working with somebody and you're trying to really understand them from within, in this case understanding what Taylor situation was. So, using the checkout, is my way to make sure that whatever I said to her you know, seem to fit. But an, another type of check out is what you just mentioned. Which is when they, the person will say, yeah that's exactly the way or yes that, that's how I, I'm feeling now and you see, and it helps you to continue refocusing. As opposite to struggling to be out of the here and now wondering where did I get lost. So, her reactions were almost like an additional type of check out that helped me navigate more closely to her experience in terms of comment and all that so that, that was a very good thing for myself as a counselor also. Make me feel that we were moving in the appropriate direction, yeah. 

01:16:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I, I forgot one important thing in this discussion and going back to the negative, Carlos started out with a very good summary which is one of the skills were also seeking to teach and that good summary, I think made it a little more difficult to do a negative session, because you felt heard at the beginning and the problem, maybe you were expecting to continue to be heard. 

01:16:50
TAYLOR Yeah, I think so. He seemed to get it in the beginning and then towards the end I was like wait, what happened that we missed each other somewhere. 

01:16:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So right there, we see a very superb summary and then we see how you can screw up from there but we also see the importance of the summary as a skill and you've got an accurate summary going back exactly keeps moving, so well done again, the negative keep in mind folks that the negative began with an excellent summary. Thank you both. 

01:17:20
TAYLOR Thank you. 

01:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I think, that was very well done. I really appreciate it and I enjoyed watching you two here. Thanks. 

01:17:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Thank you. 

01:17:25
TAYLOR Thank you. 

01:17:30
Reflection of Feeling 

01:17:35
Mary Bradford Ivey, EdD, NCC 

01:17:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Emotions and feelings often underlie cognitions. Emotions are also the engines of change. Without the support of our feelings cognitive change is nearly impossible. Reflecting feelings is recognized by many as the most significant listening skill after tending behavior and it is central to emotional regulation. In the interview, it's important to identify the underlying feelings of a client and feed them back in order to clarify the client's emotional experience. Reflection of feeling is often combined with paraphrasing and summarization. A reflection of feeling often includes, one, listening to the client and observing their non-verbal behavior, body language, facial expression and vocal tone. A sentence stem for example, I sense your feeling or I hear you saying. Naming the feeling and placing that feeling into context. It sounds like you feel sad when your partner talks to you that way. Here and now reflections in the session are often very effective for example, right now you're feeling frustrated. Checking out your reflection of accuracy, is that right? Is what I'm saying close to what you're feeling and experiencing? Finally, don't just reflect negative feelings, also search for stories of strengths and positive. It may take a shift in direction and even a question but always balance negative emotion with clients strengths. We don't really solve our problem with discussion of problems, a strength based approach is what will make a difference. 

01:19:20
Negative Example Reflection of Feeling Mary and Geraldine 

01:19:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, hi Geraldine, how are you doing? 

01:19:30
GERALDINE I'm doing okay. 

01:19:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good, good. You said, you wanted to see me and I have been seeing all the students at not only high school before they umm… go on to their career or to college and what would you like to talk about today? 

01:19:40
GERALDINE Yeah, I'm super worried about going off to college and I don't know, I'll do well, I'm just very worried. 

01:19:50
Denial of feelings 

01:19:50
Talking too much 

01:19:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY you're worried, how could you be worried? How could you be worried Geraldine? Honest to goodness, you're on the top of your class, I would think you'd be really confident you know, you you've proven yourself here and it was hard getting here but you've proven yourself. I've, being worried, oh my goodness. I think you should be feeling terrific about being accepted and being able to go to Penn State, such a good school. 

01:20:10
GERALDINE Yeah, I'm just, I'm so just really scared, I don't know, if I do well… 

01:20:15
Denial of feelings, not listening and telling client how she should feel 

01:20:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Scared, oh, why be scared. I mean, you have to be self-confident in these situations. I mean, really… 

01:20:15
GERALDINE Yeah, I guess... 

01:20:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You've shown yourself, you know, that to be self-confident here at school and you'll do the same thing when you get to Penn State. You just take over the skills you had here and you'll bring them to Penn State and do the same thing again. 

01:20:30
Note how client disagrees with Mary 

01:20:30
GERALDINE I just don't know, if I can do, I don't know if I can do that. 

01:20:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, I, you can, you know what, if you think you can, you can, you can just do it. If you say, I can do it, I can do it and you're just going and do it. Don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, we're all behind you here and you should be able to do it. No worries. 

01:20:45
GERALDINE I, I don't know. 

01:20:50
This is almost attacking 

01:20:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You don't know, what do you mean you don't know? How could you not know that you would be absolutely wonderful there, I am, my goodness sakes. 

01:20:55
GERALDINE It's just college is so hard and so far away. 

01:21:00
Denial of feelings 

01:21:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh it's, it's not that far away, only four hours and how do you know it's hard? Might be easy, who knows, it might even be kind of fun, who knows. I can't, can't imagine you'll have a difficult time. 

01:21:10
GERALDINE I, I guess, I don't know. 

01:21:15
Positive Example Reflection of Feeling 

01:21:15
Mary and Geraldine 

01:21:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Geraldine, how are you? 

01:21:15
GERALDINE I'm doing okay. 

01:21:20
Warm greeting and smiling 

01:21:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good, good, as you know I'm seeing all the seniors in high school and of course you're one of my special, special seniors this year and I know you wanted to talk a bit, so umm… this is a big year for you. How are you doing? 

01:21:35
GERALDINE Yeah, it is. I'm doing okay, it's been hard to have all my classes and apply to college and having those feelings of "will I get in?" and then recalling again, how I felt when I first got to Nutley and… 

01:21:50
Paraphrase 

01:21:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So here you are. 

01:21:50
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:21:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Soon you are starting to feel like you felt back then, so you feeling the difficulty of moving to a new place and the challenge of a getting in… 

01:22:00
GERALDINE I'm so scared of having that feeling again of changing a new place. 

01:22:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Changing. 

01:22:05
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:22:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Where did you come- why don't you give us a little back- a little background of where you came from… 

01:22:10
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:22:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Remind me. 

01:22:10
GERALDINE I grew up in Union City until about seventh grade. Umm… Union City is a Latin town, very close to New York City and there's a lot of people who look like me and we spoke the same language… 

01:22:25
Reflecting of feeling 

01:22:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So it felt very comfortable for you to be there. 

01:22:25
GERALDINE …yeah, of course. 

01:22:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Near to your family and everybody look like you, and talk like you and… 

01:22:30
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:22:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Eat like you're good food. 

01:22:30
GERALDINE Yes, they did. 

01:22:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, what was it like to come to Nutley high school? 

01:22:35
GERALDINE Umm… it was very, very hard to continually have to explain, umm… why my hair is curly or why I eat certain things at lunchtime and why sometimes I speak to my mom in Spanish. 

01:22:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So sometimes you felt a little bit left out a little bit… 

01:22:55
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:23:00
Open question 

01:23:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …not comfortable like you didn't back home and, and how did you handle that even in eighth grade? How did you, how did you have the strength to even get beyond eighth grade to hear you are senior? 

01:23:05
GERALDINE Yeah, umm… well, I kind of just you know, tried to continue on with my studies and be driven and put myself out there at the best that I could and… 

01:23:20
Reflection of feeling focus on resilience and strength 

01:23:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you had a lot of drive and you wanted to, you just had a drive and wanted to make it. 

01:23:20
GERALDINE Yeah, I did, I, I really wanted to show them that, I was no different than anybody. 

01:23:30
Open question focus on feeling 

01:23:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Uh-huh, and how does it feel during that time when you're trying to fit in and be one of them and yet trying to move ahead yourself and still be yourself, how did that feel? 

01:23:40
Note how Geraldine has moved from worry about college to focus on strength and power. 

01:23:40
GERALDINE It felt hard at times but also… powerful in a way. 

01:23:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Powerful, yeah. 

01:23:45
GERALDINE I felt like, I had the strength to do anything and help people understand that I'm no different than anybody. 

01:23:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you felt empowered in all this. 

01:23:50
GERALDINE Yeah, I did. 

01:23:55
Reflection of feeling 

01:23:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You could even teach them something. 

01:23:55
GERALDINE Yeah, yeah, I did. 

01:23:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And they could learn from you and so that was the eighth grade, you sort of got through eighth grade and then what happened in the other grades before going on? 

01:24:05
GERALDINE Yeah, so as a went through high school, it's been okay, I've been at the top of my classes and doing well and then here I am in my senior year and I'm just… 

01:24:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Started, started to feel… 

01:24:15
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:24:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …this feelings that you had when you came. 

01:24:15
GERALDINE Yeah, I do. 

01:24:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You had in the beginning and what, where are you applying? 

01:24:20
GERALDINE So my top choice is, Penn State University. It's about four hours from here. 

01:24:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh great! 

01:24:30
GERALDINE Umm… then some of my other choices are some colleges in New York, Syracuse umm… I applied to some schools in New Jersey as well, Rutgers, and I really hope I get into Penn State. 

01:24:40
Open question 

01:24:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What, how did you feel about, what it, why is Penn State so attractive to you? 

01:24:45
GERALDINE Umm… well, I think that, I… it sounds confusing but although I, I am scared of changing, I do want to change again and I feel that at Penn State umm… they are aiming for more diversity and I feel like that would be a great experience for me and I, when I went to visit I saw a lot of people that look like me and I feel like that would be great. 

01:25:10
Reflection of feeling 

01:25:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So that felt even more comfortable than here at Nutley high school ‘cause there aren't very many Latinos here. 

01:25:10
GERALDINE Yeah, there's none. 

01:25:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And have you been able to find friends here even though we're not a very diverse umm… high school? 

01:25:20
GERALDINE Yeah, I've been able to find a few which has been very comforting and I hope the same happens in college. 

01:25:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And do they accept, they accept you here and… 

01:25:25
GERALDINE Yeah, I think they have and I think it's been and a good experience and… 

01:25:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And you've been be able to teach them and then you felt empowered. 

01:25:40
Note big smile 

01:25:40
GERALDINE Yeah, I did. It was good feeling. 

01:25:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That's good and now you're going on to bigger things. Now, what will happen if you don't get into Penn state? What kind of feeling would you have? 

01:25:45
GERALDINE Oh man, I'm afraid of not being successful. 

01:25:50
Restatement 

01:25:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Not having success. You're afraid of not being successful. 

01:25:50
GERALDINE Probably, my biggest fear of this whole process. 

01:25:55
Reflection of feeling 

01:25:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Fear of failure, fear of failure. 

01:25:55
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:25:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Not quite making up, quite doing what you feel like you can do, because you've really got lots of strengths and you have lots to give and so far… 

01:26:05
GERALDINE Yeah, exactly. 

01:26:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And so maybe they all see that in the interview process and they will then say, yes, you are the person we want. 

01:26:10
GERALDINE I hope so that would be great. 

01:26:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I hope so. 

01:26:10
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:26:15
10 minutes pass and we pick back up to Mary focusing on Geraldine's feelings about moving away to college. 

01:26:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Geraldine, you talked a bit about coming to Penn State now and we think that's going to happen. 

01:26:25
GERALDINE Yes. 

01:26:30
Open question focus on feelings 

01:26:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Now, tell me more about your feelings about, about coming into someplace new. Going to someplace new and how you feel about, how your family feels about it? 

01:26:35
GERALDINE Yeah, so I, I'm ready but I'm scared. I'm, I'm worried that, well, I might not fit in here and… 

01:26:45
Reflection of feeling 

01:26:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you're both scared and worried and not fitting in and how does it feel? 

01:26:50
GERALDINE It feels super overwhelming. 

01:26:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Sort of overwhelming with these feelings of worry and… 

01:27:00
GERALDINE Yeah, like, I just want to stop it and not go and but then I, I feel like I'd be great at that school and it is my dream. 

01:27:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It is your dream to go there but on the other hand you just feel like, overwhelmed with these feelings of I'm not going to fit in, I'm too far from home. 

01:27:20
GERALDINE Yeah, and I'm worried that a school like Penn State going to be too hard for me. 

01:27:25
Paraphrase 

01:27:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, it's gonna be a lot different than it's, it is the big university and this is going to be tougher than it was here and in Nutley high school. You're able to handle it here but what is it could be like in Penn State and how does it feel? 

01:27:35
GERALDINE Yeah, it feels rough. I… I, don't know where, what's going to be like there and I think that, that idea of not knowing… 

01:27:50
Reflection of feeling 

01:27:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's sort of the fear of the unknown. So, what your fear is, what's unknown, we don't know what it's going to be like. Is it going to be like moving from Union City to Nutley? Is it going to be like, what's it going to be like? 

01:28:00
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:28:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know, this is the big time, and can you make it? 

01:28:05
GERALDINE And sort of my parents you know, going away and the distance, I've never been away from them. I'm just so worried about like losing touch with my family and you know, you look at the movies and when that kid goes away to college, they make their, that kid's room into storage and I'm just, I don't want to lose that connection… 

01:28:25
Summary 

01:28:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You don't want to lose that wonderful close connection you have with your family because you've been with them and they've been supportive of you and you've been together and now it's four hours away and you fear that they might even change the room and make it a den or something else and when you come home and they wouldn't be the same, they won't be the same. What's it going to feel like? 

01:28:45
GERALDINE It makes me feel really sad. 

01:28:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That makes you feel sad. to even think of leaving them. 

01:28:50
GERALDINE Yeah, I just don't want to be forgotten. 

01:28:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You don't want to be forgotten, you want to be a very much a part of their lives the whole time. 

01:29:00
Notice Geraldine's eyes sparkle when she says proud 

01:29:00
GERALDINE But I also want them to be proud of me and just you know, I'll be the first person to go away to college outside of New Jersey from my family so, yeah… 

01:29:10
Mary's next lead is a reflection of mixed feelings and summary of what is going on 

01:29:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you have these mixed feelings sort of like, fear of leaving home but yet, you want them to be proud of you that you can be the first one in your family to actually leave home and go away to school, to a big school, name school and follow your dreams sort of more independent than maybe the rest of the family has been. So you're that drive it to… 

01:29:35
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:29:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That you've had is going to take you this far away from home but yet, the feeling of a little bit of insecurity. 

01:29:40
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:29:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Fearing a fear of failure and being afraid of what's, what's next? What's going to happen to me? 

01:29:50
GERALDINE Yeah, that, I do feel insecure and unsure of my ability and sort of unsure of like, every aspect of my life right now like, with my friends and my family. I know our bond is close now but time changes a lot of things. 

01:30:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What is it going to be like because you've been very, very close and you've had your friends and your family everybody around you and now you're leaving all that comfort of all that and you're moving on. 

01:30:15
GERALDINE Yes. 

01:30:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY To do your own independent thing and going to this biggest school and that… 

01:30:20
GERALDINE Yeah, yeah, that comfortability, I'm like afraid of, I'm like willing to change it but I'm also, what am I going to do to gain it back in a new place? 

01:30:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, so you, like the feeling that this part of you that wants once to move on and this party is just really likes it with your family and with everybody else, it's just so comfortable. 

01:30:40
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:30:45
GERALDINE Yeah, I'm really scared… 

01:30:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, so it is very fearful. 

01:30:50
Having explored mixed feelings and fears about leaving, Mary now focuses on positive feelings and strengths. Don't get caught with only the negative. 

01:30:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What uh…, what strengths do you think you have and your family have to help you to move forward or to get through this period of time? 

01:31:05
GERALDINE I think that my family really loves me and that they…although, it's going to be difficult being four hours. I know that they're going to support me no matter what I choose to do and within myself, I think that, I am smart and I've done well in high school and I can only hope to have the same intelligence in college. 

01:31:25
Summary with focus on strengths 

01:31:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah so, so they love you and they're going to be there and you're going to do as well probably, there as you did in Nutley high school and you came in feeling scared and worried and I'm sure of yourself, when you first came here and look what happened, you're graduating, top your class and ready to move on. 

01:31:40
GERALDINE Um-hmm. 

01:31:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So… 

01:31:45
GERALDINE Yeah, that in itself is a great feeling and just… 

01:31:50
Positive reflection of feeling 

01:31:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That gives you some more strength, doesn't it? To feel like… 

01:31:50
GERALDINE It does. 

01:31:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …I've done well, okay, I can do well again. 

01:31:50
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:31:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY …and you'll carry that with you and maybe you'll carry your family and your friends with you too. They'll be part of you in your heart. You know, be with you. 

01:32:00
GERALDINE Yeah, and I hope that I can make friends there as well that are similar to me and yeah. 

01:32:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You will reach out to other people and make friends with them too, just like you've done here. Well, I think, I wish you great luck. 

01:32:10
GERALDINE Thank you. 

01:32:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I think, there's only positive things ahead. 

01:32:15
GERALDINE Yeah, I hope so. 

01:32:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It's great talking to you today Geraldine. 

01:32:15
GERALDINE Same. 

01:32:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Thank you.

Reflection of Feeling Debrief Mary, Geraldine and Carlos 

01:32:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Geraldine and Mary, uh… thank you for the opportunity to join in. I, I have a special affection for reflection of feelings because it's at the core of our counseling skills and counseling process. 

01:32:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Certainly it is, it certainly is yeah. 

01:32:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT And you did two good demonstrations, one, the negative way of working with feelings and, and then followed by a positive one. Let's focus on the first one and on the client. 

01:32:55
GERALDINE Okay. 

01:32:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So how did you feel umm… when you were trying to express your feelings and Mary was addressing that? 

01:33:05
GERALDINE Umm… well it was, it was hard, I was trying to get what I wanted to say across and she just kind a shut me out and said, no, this is, you shouldn't be feeling this. Umm… un-validating my feelings. 

01:33:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT invalidating. 

01:33:20
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:33:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT How interesting because, because a number of times when we work with feelings uh… people we know, it could be too emotional and yet the person who's experiencing the feelings or trying to express, they feel that they see that you never been addressing someway of form. 

01:33:40
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:33:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So that's the way you felt. 

01:33:40
GERALDINE Yes, I did feel like that. 

01:33:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT How did you feel as a counselor? 

01:33:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well, I, it's hard to do this but you know I thought, I'm you know, I wasn't paying attention, I was denying her feelings, I was kind of preachy. Almost like a mother saying you know, "you don't need to worry about going to college, you'll be great." I mean, you know, almost go for it like, Nike go for it. I mean, I was doing everything wrong and really denying those feelings really. Not letting them come out naturally. 

01:34:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT You were not letting the feeling to come forward and also denying them but I, I, I found your metaphor like the Nike, just do it. 

01:34:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY just do it, you can do it, you can go for it. Not even wanted to talk about the feelings. 

01:34:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT And you said, "well, it was difficult but…" 

01:34:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. 

01:34:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Is it that difficult to, to, overlook feelings or, or try to tell people what to do? 

01:34:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well for, for me it is. When I'm in a counseling relationship, I think it's really important to get into somebody's feelings. I was trained at the University of Wisconsin just after Carl Rogers had left there and all we did was reflect feelings so, feelings to me is one of the most important skills besides listening at getting at people's deeper feelings, our cognitions everything is based on those deeper feelings and so it's very important to get at all levels and to be able to reflect those feelings and to be able to talk about it and feel comfortable talking about it and bring them up in the sessions, they're important. 

01:35:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, that led me to the other side, meaning the second demonstration on the, the positive reflection of feeling. So, how did you feel on that segment? 

01:35:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, I love to do that. I felt much more comfortable, much more comfortable and she's a wonderful client, she had lots of feelings. I was able to express those, you know feed those feelings back to her and then she nodded so she recognized that they were, I think it was on target. 

01:35:30
GERALDINE Yeah, I think so too. 

01:35:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, so how did you feel in that segment? 

01:35:30
GERALDINE Yeah, in, in that one, I did feel validated and I felt like, she understood what I was going through and that's important. I feel like, it gives me a sense of wanting to talk more and opening up more about different feelings and explore my feelings more when I know that she can understand. 

01:35:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So a sense of aknowledg-being acknowledged, acknowledgment, exploration of feelings, wanting to be involved in the process, which is exactly the opposite you felt on the first segment. 

01:36:00
GERALDINE Yeah. 

01:36:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT But she also ask you for umm… some of your personal strength. Did you notice that and if you did how did that uh… sort of feels like? 

01:36:15
GERALDINE Yeah, I noticed that and I thought, it was a great skill that she used it. It gave me a sense of, well these feelings are happening now but you know, I was able to conquer them before and that was a good thing to look back at because when you have negative feelings or feelings of fear, you're unable to really think of the positives before a time where you overcame those feelings. 

01:36:35
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT And you did that intentionally. 

01:36:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, yes. We want to build resilience in clients. We want them to have strengths to overcome their problems and if we do want to leave, we do not leave clients just with the problems, just talking about problems because that brings them down. We want to show them that they you know, yes, they have all these things but they also have strengths to, to work at solving the problems and she has lots of strengths and so I was kind of be abler to you know, go through and think about her strengths and family and how she's overcome several difficulties here at Nutley high school and, and she will go on to do the same thing. 

01:37:15
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Which is an interesting point because you, you, you were very skilled in pinpointing the feelings deepening on some of them but also always keeping in mind opportunities for doing better and not to let the person feel that they didn't have options or strengths to bring to the situation. Is that they… 

01:37:35
GERALDINE Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think she did a great job about that. 

01:37:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT I, I believe so. Thank you so much. 

01:37:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Thank you. 

01:37:40
GERALDINE Thank you. 

01:37:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT It was a pleasure to watch you in action. 

01:37:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Thank you Carlos. 

01:37:50
Identify the Feeling 

01:37:50
In the following short segments, try to identify the feelings of each person 

01:37:55
UNKNOWN I think, I've been struggling with lately is uh… I found one of my friends died recently just getting the call and recognizing that I'm not going to get a chance to ever talk to him again that this is forever that, this is part of my new reality. I can't call him and just check and see how the semester is going, anything like that and the feeling of kind of sadness and emptiness that comes with that is, it's been hard and it doesn't feel like myself. 

01:38:25
Let's watch that again… 

01:38:25
UNKNOWN I think, what I've been struggling with lately is uh… I found one of my friends died recently just getting the call and recognizing that I'm not going to get a chance to ever talk to him again that, this is forever that this is part of my new reality. I can't call him and just check and see how the semester is going, anything like that and the feeling of kind of sadness and emptiness that comes with that is, it's been hard and it doesn't feel like myself. 

01:38:50
UNKNOWN It was about 10 years ago, when we were, I was dealing with the impending loss of my mother and uh… we were sitting, my family sitting in the hospital room surrounded by a lot of pain, sickness and illness waiting to hear the update from the doctor of what's going to happen with our mother. So, we found that doctor finally came and he calls in the conference room and he said, these are not looking good. You have to make a decision and we have to decide, do we keep our mother on life support or not? And as we're talking about it, this big fear and feeling came over me, where it's like, I'm going to lose my mother. I'm losing my best friend and I'm actually gonna have to be an adult from this point forward and to this day I still feel that, even though it happened over ten years ago but it just brings it back to a place of just unbearable pain. 

01:39:55
Let's watch that again… 

01:40:00
UNKNOWN It was about 10 years ago when we were, I was dealing with the, the impending loss of my mother and uh… we were sitting, my family sitting in the hospital room surrounded by a lot of pain, sickness and illness waiting to hear the update from the doctor of what's going to happen with our mother.

01:41:00
UNKNOWN So I have to tell you, I'm really angry and anger isn't something I'm entirely used to feeling but I am sick of being taken advantage of. So, I have this friend who constantly uses me to her benefit. If she needs someone to listen, I'm there. If she needs a ride, she calls me. If she's short on cash, she knows I'll give it to her. But then, when I need someone to be there for me, she isn't and then she's constantly asking me for my advice and then does the exact opposite. It's like, she's not even listening to me like, why ask me for my advice if you're not even going to listen to it? Then every once in a while when I want to, vent to her, ask her for advice, she's to busy for me, she's nowhere to be found. It's like, I don't even matter like, my feelings don't even matter. I'm so frustrated and angry with her that sometimes, I just want to scream. 

01:41:50

01:42:50
UNKNOWN So, I work with kids and I, I've always love working with kids, I work in schools but I never saw myself as a parent you know, I saw something better working with students then actually being a parent. So, I never considered being a parent. But then my brother had my niece and my nephew and they just completely changed my view on the world. You know, every time I see them and we meet because we live apart, my niece comes running into my arms, no matter how big she's getting, she's 10 now and my nephew is right behind her you know, trailing her and they just run into my arms and I get absolute joy and elation, every time they do that. Since, she was little to now and they got me thinking this is some of the most happiest times of my life to seeing them every time we don't see each other. That's what I think of myself maybe, I should consider thinking about having kids instead of just working with them.

01:44:45
UNKNOWN I just got a new job, which is really my dream job but it's about three hours away from home and I'm extremely excited but also anxious to be leaving home and venturing off on my own. I'm unsure about what will happen and how I will handle being on my own but I'm also looking forward to the change.

01:45:35
Allen E. Ivey 

01:45:35
and 

01:45:35
Dominiqua Monica Griffin 

01:45:40
What is a Community Genogram? 

01:45:40
Developed by the client to provide data on family, environmental, and cultural background. 

01:45:45
Clients can generate their own visual model using their own style. 

01:45:50
Counselor listens to client descriptions and highlights significant issues. 

01:46:00
Emphasis is always on strengths, positive assets, and what the client can do, rather than cant do. 

01:46:05
These resources from a positive base on which clients can resolve issues. 

01:46:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Hey Dominiqua, nice to see you again. 

01:46:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Hello! Nice to see you too. 

01:46:15
ALLEN E. IVEY We're going to have a couple sessions today we agreed right? 

01:46:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, but I do want to begin as always with saying, we are recording and if you want us to stop at any point that's fine. 

01:46:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

01:46:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I don't want. Well, we're going to do today is we agreed is that, you brought in the community Genogram. 

01:46:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:46:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I really don't like to work with a client unless I understand where they're coming from? Who they are in a broader context? 

01:46:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

01:46:40
ALLEN E. IVEY That means, your conception of your own community where you grew up or what's community is important to you. Dominiqua, I really like to see here, what all you have in your community Genogram, okay. 

01:46:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, so a lot of the parts are interconnected. 

01:46:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

01:47:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN My family is very religious umm… so I put the church here because that has definitely influenced my upbringing. Umm… actually, my grandfather is a Preacher, so going to church every Sunday was, is the norm. Umm… now that I don't live at home, that's been problematic for them that I don't go to church every Sunday. Umm… but, I still have the faith like, I still believe in God and other thing. 

01:47:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Your faith is still there. 

01:47:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes, and I still have the relationship, umm… with God. So… with my family, umm… I grew up mainly with maternal side of my family, with my mother, umm… she was a teen mom. So, I pretty much grew up in a "village" in terms of with my grandparents and then her siblings. So, she has three other sisters, they, my grandparents have four girls, all four years apart actually. 

01:48:00
ALLEN E. IVEY All play together. 

01:48:05
Notice Allen listening, clarifying and encouraging There are many minimal encourages 

01:48:05
Note Dominiqua's strengths: family, culture, and spirituality 

01:48:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, so I grew up in the household with my mom and her siblings so that's why when I refer to the village that has raised me, it's mainly her side of the family. Umm… so my grandmother is actually from Barbados originally uh… so and my grandfather is from south from, from the south, from Pensacola, Florida. So, I grew up with the best of both worlds, I always refer to it as in terms of the cultures that were inside of the house uh… but then right here when I refer to home, I'm referring to the Bronx New York, which is where my family like, is currently and where everyone was raised at umm… in the Bronx and the area itself is predominantly Caribbean umm… that's the majority of the people that live there mainly from Jamaica, Trinidad, so being in that environment that had an influence on me as well. 

01:48:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So the home actually also represents a community within itself. 

01:49:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:49:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

01:49:00
Notice Allen's use of minimal encourages. The client directs the conversation. 

01:49:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, and… if you look, you'll see some of the lines are colored in because of, or bigger, so in this aspect like the family arrow is much bigger than all of the of the arrow… 

01:49:15
ALLEN E. IVEY That makes sense. 

01:49:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN … that are pointing to me and then the one's that I've shaded in are the ones that at the end of the day, if all things were to just fall to pieces. I know that this is what has influenced me. 

01:49:25
Community and family from a foundation for our individual clients 

01:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY These are your foundation. 

01:49:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, definitely. 

01:49:30
ALLEN E. IVEY That's helpful, thank you. 

01:49:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, and then we get to this end umm… now more it's a little… 

01:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Little different. 

01:49:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, definitely. Uh… these are more like external influences in terms of school so, I went to public school in New York City in the Bronx and then I went to school actually in El Barrio for high school umm… which is the, considered Spanish Harlem umm… but basically in the top of my classes and when we think about tracking, I was definitely in the top classes all the way through. Umm… which helped me get into University of Buffalo and I received a scholarship there, then I went to Howard for my master's degree and now I'm here at Penn State. So, that has definitely been and influence because of what I've learned along the way and the people that I've come into contact with uh… getting different opportunities but mainly through school. So, my family is really big on education uh…and I'm actually not the first person in my family to start a PhD. Program, my mom she has her master's degree, my grandparents they started school as well. So, it's pretty much then norm. One of my other cousin started his PhD. 

01:50:45
ALLEN E. IVEY A real family tradition. 

01:50:50
Family pressure to succeed 

01:50:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, so umm… it's like the pressure that I feel from them because this is like okay. 

01:50:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Family tradition is now… 

01:50:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Each generation is pretty much supposed to… 

01:50:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Expectations. 

01:51:00
Desire to serve others 

01:51:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …yes, propel itself forward so… that's been a huge impact and then I put this in terms of news and media, which is something that's currently influencing me, which refers back to the session that we had previously in terms of like the burn out and dealing with different microaggressions umm… with the, with the Black Lives Matter movement and having to see a lot of police brutality on camera now and on social media. So, that's like the news and media aspect because I'm like still internalizing it and processing and trying to figure out well, what can I do for my community umm… what, in what ways can I give back not just to my community, to other communities as well, in terms of helping us to move forward. 

01:51:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I hear a lot of concern and trouble but I also hear, ‘I'm going to do something.' 

01:51:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes. 

01:51:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, that gives me a quick overview. 

01:51:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

01:52:00
Identifying specific strengths 

01:52:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Going back to your family, I'd like to identify a specific strength or two that you feel you gain from your family. 

01:52:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

01:52:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And what, what occurs to you? 

01:52:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would say… the relationship that I have with God, umm… in terms of the religious aspect, my family knows the Bible like the back of their hands and that has definitely brought them together in terms of when difficulties or when situations arise they're able to fall back on that relationship and help them get through and that was something that was definitely instilled in me. So, whenever I have an issue or I, you know, when I go to them, they'll be able to pray for me or pray with me and talk to me about you know, like different stories and that would definitely help me get through which it has in the past. 

01:52:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So very, very close connection. 

01:53:00
Open Question 

01:53:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:53:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Can you come up with a specific image of a time when the connection was particularly strong and helpful? 

01:53:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. Umm… I speak to them every single day, it's so… a time when the relationship was really strong, I would have to say… going back to undergrad, when after, well, it was actually during my freshman year. I wanted to change my major, I started off as a biomedical sciences major and… I wanted to be an, an eye doctor, an optometrist and then I realized you know what, I don't really think that this is for me. Uh… so, having to process that with them, they really helped me get through that. Yeah, yeah. 

01:53:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So, processing that with them was really helpful. 

01:53:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I would, I remember walking across campus crying like thinking about it. Umm… I'm smiling now but that wasn't the case then. 

01:53:55
Reflection of feeling 

01:53:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So there was a lot of mixed feelings and I'm living up to I'm supposed to be, is it all right. 

01:53:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:54:00
ALLEN E. IVEY At the same time so, that you got a great comfort from, from communicating with them about that issue. 

01:54:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:54:10
Body anchoring -Locating positive feelings/memories in the body that can be used at moments of stress 

01:54:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, as you think about that feeling of comfort and support, where might you, you may want to close your eyes or where do you feel it in your body, that comfort and support from God and your family? 

01:54:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Probably like, in my arms. 

01:54:20
ALLEN E. IVEY In your arms, okay. 

01:54:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

01:54:25
ALLEN E. IVEY And what do you get out of that feeling and what do you get out of that feeling in your arms? 

01:54:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Like a warm sensation. 

01:54:35
ALLEN E. IVEY A warm sensation, protective? 

01:54:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that right? 

01:54:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I would definitely say like this… 

01:54:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Warm sensation. 

01:54:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN This covering or… 

01:54:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm, so encircled. 

01:54:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN like a comfort, um-hmm. 

01:54:50
Family support provides comfort and strength 

01:54:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So, it's kind of a feeling and that I gather is always with you. 

01:54:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY The warmth and comfort. 

01:54:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

01:54:55
ALLEN E. IVEY You relay on a pretty regular, I hear. 

01:55:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, yes. 

01:55:00
ALLEN E. IVEY okay, it's helpful. 

01:55:05
Question about community strengths. 

01:55:05
ALLEN E. IVEY What about the whole community? Can you think of an image in the community that might come as a particularly positive time or specific? 

01:55:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I would have to say… I can think back to different moments in school. 

01:55:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. Here, so we're on the school. 

01:55:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Oh yeah, well. 

01:55:30
ALLEN E. IVEY It's okay, stay there. 

01:55:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Well, those, those two kind of go hand in hand for me. 

01:55:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm, okay. 

01:55:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So… just like, relaxing outside I would say from home. Umm… I remember growing up in the Bronx and going outside playing, double dutch with my friends. 

01:55:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

01:55:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And that's a very like, positive image that I have now when I see my godsons and my little cousins outside it just, it's very nostalgic and in terms of remembering what my childhood was like. 

01:56:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I see a kind of smile, when you talk about the, about the double dutch. Can you put it in a feeling of that within your body? 

01:56:10
Anchoring good feeling in gut 

01:56:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I felt that one in my stomach definitely. 

01:56:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Summary, a good feeling in the gut, that's kind of nice. 

01:56:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

01:56:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So you have a good feeling in your gut, you can… 

01:56:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:56:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And the same thing happened at school, is that it is? 

01:56:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:56:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Basically, back and forth to school. 

01:56:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, umm… but then, school is a little bit different because of the different like, neighbor, one that neighborhoods but umm… cities that I've been in for school. Uh… so, in the Bronx, the last time I went to school in the Bronx was for my freshman year of high school but since then, I was in Harlem for the rest the remainder of high school and then Buffalo, D.C. and now here in State College. So, that is a little bit different umm… but I would say, because of those locations, I've definitely grown to love each of the areas uh… and like those cities and they are much slower than living in New York. 

01:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, it is. 

01:57:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So… 

01:57:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I can understand that. 

01:57:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, when I go home sometimes, I feel overwhelmed. Umm… so… living in these other cities has helped me to really appreciate like a much slower pace. Umm… yeah. 

01:57:35
Paraphrase 

01:57:35
ALLEN E. IVEY So, kind of two feelings, you love New York, occasionally overwhelmed, then that here at Penn, here in Happy Valley, Penn State, a little more a little slower. 

01:57:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

01:57:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Again, I kind of like to ask, I guess we have to get kinda down to two feelings the overwhelmed uh… feeling in New York, what comes to your mind there? 

01:57:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN In terms of an image or…? 

01:57:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:57:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… just like the traffic. 

01:58:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, it gets me too. 

01:58:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I mean, then like, just the hustle and bustle of it all like the constant, I have to keep moving, I have to keep moving umm… where as in, like a place like state college is more relaxed and a lot more greenery and like things that I would do for fun here, I definitely don't do it for fun in New York. So like, being able to go hiking, umm… and just have a more access to the outdoors in a sense. 

01:58:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

01:58:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Uh… yeah, yeah. 

01:58:30
ALLEN E. IVEY We've got the, the overwhelmed and maybe even little excited feeling in the city and that kind of-where does that hit you and where does the other one hit you as well in the body? 

01:58:40
New York body feelings 

01:58:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I may need to close my eyes for this one. 

01:58:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, fine. Thank you, please do. 

01:58:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So when I think about New York, it's more in this area, yeah, that was, what I was drawn to like the thigh, leg area. 

01:59:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And what type of feeling is that? 

01:59:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… more tense than… 

01:59:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Tense. 

01:59:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …the other area. 

01:59:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

01:59:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

01:59:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You're more tense, okay, and what, what, what about Happy Valley? 

01:59:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN umm… 

01:59:20
ALLEN E. IVEY An image in Happy Valley. 

01:59:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, I don't know, somewhere like in this area. 

01:59:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, any other place… 

01:59:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

01:59:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Buffalo, I think, stand in the snow. 

01:59:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… more so like in this area. 

01:59:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, oh, I see in this, in the neck. 

01:59:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah like, coming down in this area… 

01:59:35
ALLEN E. IVEY What does that feel like? 

01:59:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN It's not tense like, my legs were tense for a second when thinking about New York but, in here, this is something different. I don't quite know yet. 

01:59:50
Moving from tension to relaxed 

01:59:50
ALLEN E. IVEY I heard, having you say, it was coming down. 

01:59:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

01:59:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Where would it come down to? 

02:00:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… probably like around the stomach area. 

02:00:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Kind of, almost fulfilling? Not quite. 

02:00:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I don't know, if I would say fulfilling. 

02:00:10
ALLEN E. IVEY If you can, would you apply a word to that, other way? 

02:00:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… 

02:00:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You're hiking, you're here in Happy Valley. 

02:00:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, more of a… but still not, I wouldn't say more of a relaxed feeling like, being in Happy Valley is not necessarily relaxing but… 

02:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY I can see that too. 

02:00:35
Positive emotions can control and overrule negative emotions 

02:00:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN But the area helps me to process it a little bit more. So, I guess like that, like a, like a, insightful kind of… 

02:00:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh… 

02:00:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, like being able to really think and reflect and yeah. 

02:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Oh really. 

02:00:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:00:50
Interpretation with checkout 

02:00:50
ALLEN E. IVEY It's almost like, in one sense being here helps put yourself together, is that true? 

02:00:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:00:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Interesting. 

02:00:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:01:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Impressive. So, the reason I go through this, by the way, is there anything, we have not done a specific one in the church or you just, there's a need for another one beyond the church? 

02:01:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No, no. Umm… so the church was higher, sorry the church was higher because of like, it's like the relationship that I have with God is really influencing it all, so that's why it's higher than all of these because it has like a direct impact on all of them. 

02:01:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I don't want to lay anything on you but I also heard, I sense the feeling of pride. 

02:01:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:01:40
Pride from family and community 

02:01:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that right? I see your smile, I kind of caught. I sense that behind, that the feeling of pride. 

02:01:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:01:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Could you tell me a little bit more about that feeling of pride? 

02:01:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, umm… it's definitely stems from my family and what they have instilled in me umm… just, being very sure of myself, umm… and growing up have been the access and ability to do different things. 

02:01:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

02:02:00
Pride as integrative to self 

02:02:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I would stay, even though I grew up in the Bronx, I was definitely very sheltered uh… because of like, and when people think of the Bronx or living in New York, they automatically think oh you lived in an apartment or… umm… you know, like, an apartment building or something like that but my family has owned a house that they, that we live in since the ‘70s but late ‘70s umm… right from when I was born umm… so it was always this kind of like, not an obvious uh… difference but it was a clear like you know, you had, you, you are different but, not different in terms of being better but just different like, my experiences are different. So the exposure that I had and ability to do different things is not the same that I would say for everyone living in that, in the area, in the community that I grew up in. 

02:02:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So the pride and background from the family… 

02:03:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN More so blessed. 

02:03:00
ALLEN E. IVEY More blessed? 

02:03:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

02:03:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, I'll take that. Okay, blessed is a nicer word than pride, I'm glad I asked about pride. We got that something important. 

02:03:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:03:10
ALLEN E. IVEY That's nice, makes me feel good. Okay, umm… just very, very briefly uh… what happens to you when you get into the news and the media, Black Lives Matter uh… the attack on them, etc. all of this awful stuff that happens. 

02:03:35
Relying on her strengths 

02:03:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, umm… just like know, knowing that I've been blessed with this opportunity and trying to figure out, well, what would my… what would my role be in this entire process? 

02:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

02:03:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN So… I know that, I can't be on the front lines protesting every single day. 

02:03:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Troublesome. 

02:04:00
Dominiqua reframes what she can do 

02:04:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, umm… but in… terms of like, what I do in academia making sure that what I do has a positive impact on the community in which I've grown up in and then other areas as well. So the students that I've helped in D.C. and now I'm working in the school and State collage… 

02:04:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, so that's, that's interesting. So you've taken a negative issue and turned it into a positive action. 

02:04:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:04:30
Person-in-community 

02:04:30
ALLEN E. IVEY When you think about your standing up for what you believe uh… what occurs to you? What image do you have that, of yourself, I see strength in your eyes right now. That's interesting since actually can see strength in your eyes. So, what comes to your mind around the strength to deal with all this crap? 

02:04:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I… I don't feel like I'm… at the top of anything and, and I would say, I'm probably like in a circle like, if I had an image, it would be me like, in a circle like, working with people, not necessarily working on behalf of them or for them… 

02:05:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Working with. 

02:05:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah. 

02:05:10
ALLEN E. IVEY This all, well, I noticed some of the same movements when you talked about your church and family. 

02:05:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And certainly… 

02:05:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN The same, Um-hmm. 

02:05:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that kind of the same thing? 

02:05:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yes. 

02:05:20
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I hear a very strong desire for community relationship and I also, and this is my word, I also see strength… 

02:05:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:05:30
ALLEN E. IVEY …to do these things. Okay, I think we might call it for now with us. We got some things we can use in the next session. 

02:05:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

02:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you very much. 

02:05:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, thank you. 

02:05:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

02:05:45
Community Genogram 

02:05:45
Commitment to Action and Change 

02:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Hi again, we've agreed you and I together that we will demonstrate a little bit more, what could be done with the final and most important phase of the interview. Uh… so much of counseling and psychotherapy stops at the exploration stage and doesn't deal with commitment to action. 

02:06:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:06:15
Summary 

02:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And we got into commitment to action uh… with the idea that you are, going to journal a little more specific time for yourself, which probably I ought to do uh… that you are going to make more effort to separate the work from the fun and I always see you smile when you think about having fun and also, I heard you say that, maybe my work, if I reframe it a bit, can be a bit more fun. 

02:06:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, definitely. 

02:06:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And what might I have missed in that kind of summary of where we've been so far? 

02:06:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I think that's pretty much it, just making sure that I take care of myself. 

02:06:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Yes, self positive, self talk. 

02:06:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:06:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

02:06:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And actively do so, lifeline, actively do so, self… 

02:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Actively do so. 

02:07:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:07:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And we talked about a commitment for tomorrow and that commitment sound like at least to go for a week or two uh… so I'd like to do a little more long term… 

02:07:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

02:07:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh… commitment to action and the thing is that unless there's something happens after the interview, why bother with an interview, okay, I'm pretty well convinced that something will happen uh… but what we're going to do is a little more long term planning and there's always a danger in long term planning, it puts more pressure on you. 

02:07:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:07:45
Open question 

02:07:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So we're fantasizing, it's not reality, okay? So, we've got plan for the next, uh… tomorrow, we're going to plan for the next week, a plan to get by the exams and I plan to go get to the gym. What about the next, the time between now and Christmas and then how it's going to be at home in New York for Christmas for you? How can we make that better for you? 

02:08:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay, uh… so I'll be starting the exam on the 19th, still then…I, since I won't be in classes, I'll make sure that I'm able to get to the gym, umm… at least maybe, four times, four or five times during the week. 

02:08:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

02:08:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And then… that's pretty much, it, I could increase, you mentioned like meditating and praying, umm… trying to incorporate that and I give myself a few minutes to do so, maybe in the morning or before bed umm… that seems realistic. 

02:08:50
ALLEN E. IVEY One thing that's been helpful for me, I've just recently got into breathing, have you done any work in breathing? 

02:08:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:09:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Breathing from the stomach. 

02:09:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Uh-hmm. 

02:09:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And that is a nice way to meditate and even on the gym this morning, I was focusing on breathing and, and rhythm so that I wasn't just, a lot of people exercise, I got it and that makes my exercise more relaxing. How, how are you when it comes to that? 

02:09:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I'm more aware of it when I'm on the treadmill, uh… trying to focus on breathing. 

02:09:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You are already, okay, so your breathing got, so I say continue breathing. 

02:09:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay, yes. 

02:09:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And that's not a bad thing to do in stress either. Is it, maybe even during the exam. 

02:09:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, that's what I need to do tomorrow. 

02:09:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So that's one way we can do a lot to care for ourselves uh… so then there's at home and you'll enjoy your family. 

02:09:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:10:00
Open question 

02:10:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And then you're back again, now let's fantasize some of your longer term actions, what you would like to make happen in this world? 

02:10:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Uh… I would say for starters, just creating a space where people can come in and talk that would probably be more umm… like immediate, like within the next semester, so… the organization that I'm a part of, we would like to create like a space for umm… the graduate students, the Black graduate students to come in and umm… openly talk about what's happening with them after the election umm… and how everyone is responding to that and then… like making sure, I guess, like advocating I guess in a sense. Umm… for my students as well, so when my students come in they want to bring out issues. 

02:10:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Safe spaces, advocating. 

02:11:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, that would be like more immediate umm… in terms of things that would happen within like the next semester. 

02:11:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I want to build on the, so there actually, this actually isn't happening right now in the Black community either. A place that really sit there and debrief what's gone on. 

02:11:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:11:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I see, one of the things that happens in our society at least in the media, you know, these people, uh… they're making jokes about safe spaces. 

02:11:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:11:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet, safe spaces are when we feel safe to talk. 

02:11:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

02:11:35
ALLEN E. IVEY White folks have all kinds of safe spaces. 

02:11:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:11:40
ALLEN E. IVEY White folks of all kinds of safe spaces. Gated communities, uh… the rotary, uh… the business club, white life is full of safe spaces and yet they wrote that the idea of African Americans or Mexicans or somebody others having safe spaces. 

02:12:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I think, it scares them. 

02:12:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:12:00
ALLEN E. IVEY It scares them. 

02:12:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:12:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And so I think, your idea of safe spaces, I kind of put that name on it, but I and maybe better not put a name on it. The next day you'll be in the paper. But that's really what it is and… 

02:12:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Like just, be unable to have that open and authentic conversation and really like both sides being able to hear each other because I feel like it's a lot of talking umm… but it's more still like pointing the blame on the other side and it's like no this is what's true for this person and this is what's true for this other person, so knowing like multiple truths exist and a really, really accepting that part of it. So, if I could create my space or be in a space where that's happening umm… then I feel like, it would be more of a safe space. 

02:12:55
Paraphrase 

02:12:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So you'd like to see more listening along with talking. 

02:12:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes, definitely. 

02:13:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You imagine, you need to do some little bit of monitoring or help because once you start talking, it's a lot of anger comes out. 

02:13:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, um-hmm. 

02:13:10
ALLEN E. IVEY And… 

02:13:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, I'm still trying to navigate what, what my role would be in that space because, I don't know if that would be, if it would be a safe space for me but I would also be still in counselor mode like, okay, no, well, let's, let's listen, let's make sure, you know, that all sides are being heard. 

02:13:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So you really want more than complaining, it's a lot of room to complain. 

02:13:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah, but you like them to listen to where they're hurt and also I think you'd like them to listen to where they might take action. 

02:13:45
DP: Um-hmm, yes. 

02:13:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I think that's an underlying agenda. 

02:13:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:13:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So, that's a, that's a real project. It's very serious, will you have help in that project? 

02:13:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, um-hmm, there's quite a few members that are interested in, in being in the space like that. 

02:14:00
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's a little different than separate tables, it's really, let's get together. 

02:14:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And like care for each other, but also like care for ourselves. 

02:14:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, I think almost some of the early days of the uh… Civil rights movement, there was a lot of listening and caring and not just anger but listening and caring for each other which was needed during that difficult process and we have another difficult process. So, that's a good foundation for later on. I admire that, I think it's a good plan. 

02:14:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Thank you. 

02:14:45
ALLEN E. IVEY This is not listening but I'll just share, just briefly, uh… I've been in the group recently, where… the, it's an all white group. Where several members got off on their anger about political correctness, safe spaces and I've never seen people so angry in my life. 

02:15:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:15:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I find it, I found it very scary. In a group, in a group session, supposed to be supportive, I felt very unsafe, very frightened, very angry and… I think that, some sharing stuff like that is important. Then the group went on, they're talking about guns and one of the members of the group had some fellow come on our property and she shot him in the ankle and she-she got a lot of support from the group, sheriff came and said that's okay, this is Florida, she says, I'm lucky I wasn't in, I wasn't in Chicago because then the police would have made a fuss and then the group all end up supporting her again there am I. So, I really have a deep feeling for the importance of safe spaces and listening… 

02:16:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Were you the, the councilor in that space or? 

02:16:05
ALLEN E. IVEY No, I was just a member. 

02:16:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Oh my goodness. 

02:16:10
ALLEN E. IVEY This sort of saying that… helpless and you try to speak up but you're not heard even if you try to be reasonable. 

02:16:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:16:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's, you can see how, I have some feeling how painful it can be at times. I don't know if you've experienced anything quite that. Well, you must have experienced some similar things. 

02:16:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:16:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And so, probably, a lot more than I have, let's face it. 

02:16:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:16:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, yes, definitely. But so, I don't mean to say, I really understand, but I have a partial understanding of the importance of what you're doing and… then, the idea of, I also hear the encircling thing that's that you're, so important part to you that you want to share… 

02:16:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:17:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Bringing a sense of community. 

02:17:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:17:05
Summary 

02:17:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So when your real long term goals for action is to take this idea of a circle moment and step one, is taking care of yourself and finding joy where you are, helping this group uh… you'd like to go getting support but also taking joy in each other. 

02:17:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:17:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And then thinking about things that they can do and then, that's kind of not a bad model for the future is it? 

02:17:30
Long-term goals 

02:17:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Right, no, not at all. 

02:17:30
ALLEN E. IVEY What are your fantasies for the longer term future? 

02:17:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, long term, I would say… in relation to my career goals, it would be umm… to help develop or improve school counseling in different countries like I want to be the go-to a person umm… that countries can talk to about you know, how they can improve school counseling umm… but then that relates to really help and the children umm… be able to express themselves and receive socio, emotional learning, umm… support… 

02:18:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So, this is kind of taking this whole thing to the schools and to the children and making it global. 

02:18:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:18:15
ALLEN E. IVEY That's very ambitious goal. You know what, I think, maybe you can do it. 

02:18:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:18:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you so much. 

02:18:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, think you. 

02:18:25
What happened in this session? 

02:18:30
Dominiqua solidified and became more aware of her strengths to live with the pressure and committed to balancing her life more carefully. 

02:18:35
With this, she is able to look to the future and anticipate what she can do for the world. 

02:18:45
Build on strengths and resources. 

02:18:45
We resolve issues with our strengths, not through just handling problems. 

02:18:55
Community Genogram Debrief 

02:18:55
Allen, Dominiqua, and Carlos 

02:19:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Dominiqua and Allen, uh… what a pleasure to see you in action and working with the community Genogram and the community genogram has been a stable of umm… much of our work, uh… especially with the basic attending skills, it provides a great tool but, I always wonder, how helpful it is for the person involved in doing it. So, share with us your experience with the community Genogram. 

02:19:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I really enjoyed working on the Genogram. At first, I was like, okay, what am I going to include on it. Uh… but then, once I started working on it, it was just easy because I was like, oh, Oh, okay, yes, I can include this in a lot of like, memories started coming back from my childhood and it was interesting because I've lived in so many different locations. Now, in my adult life uh… being able to see how that relates back to growing up in the Bronx with my family and understanding like the connection that they still have and the influence that they still have on my life even though I'm an adult. So, I really enjoyed the project and I feel like from like, working with him, he was able to pick up on things because I've shared so much already on the community Genogram, uh… that it would take a while to get to umm… but be unable to get to it immediately was helpful in starting the conversation because it tied into like what I want, what I came in for initially so… 

02:20:40
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, it gave you a chance to recapture part of your own background and history also to focus on the present and also to sort of work on the issues that brought you here in the first place. 

02:20:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes. 

02:20:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very good. Allen, you, you're a master in using the community Genogram and I really enjoy every time I see you're using it. But help us understand why it's so important? 

02:21:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Carols, one of my deepest commitment is that the person grows in community, work upon here. The person and community, I am a child of the community, I'm a child of the family. Uh… I think family Genogram are just fine but they still fail to look at the community. Now, fortunately, Sandra Rigazio-DiGilio, a superior and well known family therapist and some other people in family therapy are really picking up on the community Genogram more than the counseling field. The counseling field from my perspective, which is probably offensive to some, is so entwined with individual counseling. They forget the individual lives in a web of relationships. I am because, we are. I am because we are and we really, and the thing is, then I find and of course you see the way I work with this. I'm first of all interested, person is going to present things, concerns but I always focus on the positives, I always go for the sensory motor strengths which are located in the body, it may be a grandmother of a strength, it may be feeling in the heart, a feeling, a safe feeling in the gut but those feelings in the body see we forget in counseling that the body is very much a part of counseling. So that's when the real reasons this community Genogram for me, it always includes a sensory motor component of how does this community relate to my body then the idea is uh… to make what gets out uh… and faces a challenge, she's already good at taking deep breaths but you can also take a quick meditation on the time with her grandmother, the history of her preacher, the preachers in the church, a teacher in the school that came, that said something good, those people are with us and we're not alone and that's basically the purposes that we are persons in community and it makes, then you can go on from that to work on individual issues, how they're going to cope, isn't it? And then by the way, if you're doing a longer term therapy, she said some things along the way, if you really want a long term therapy, we can go back to what happened in that school that was less, that was discomforting and discover some childhood experiences which you may not have fully worked through but then as she works those experiences and, ‘oh I had this problem in elementary school but look what I had for resources.' 

02:24:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, its an integrative, comprehensive way to help the client recapture part of their past, focus on the present, capture the assets on the strength but also plan for the future because, I saw you also thinking about, what are you going to do next. 

02:24:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:24:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So, how did that work for you also? 

02:24:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, umm… It was definitely helpful in allowing me to… process like right here, right now. What I would like to do moving forward uh… knowing what the past was and being able to recall those moments in such a quick time and you know, and having those memories like, right, you are on a forefront of my mind and then being able to process, okay, so this is what, this will look like in the future and how it all relates, because sometimes I think like, focusing on family or focusing on the church, I don't necessarily see how it ties into the school umm… or like the community growing up in the Bronx but now it's like, okay, this is how it all relates that integrated piece that you mentioned. Uh… I think that was definitely beneficial. 

02:25:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT And somebody will say, it added a multicultural, even social justice dimension. 

02:25:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, definitely. 

02:25:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT With in this comprehensive uh… work. 

02:25:30
ALLEN E. IVEY And we are all multicultural beings, we bring many cultural experiences and we must not, cannot stereotype while there is generalizations each person is totally unique and you get a lot of uniqueness out of the community Genogram. 

02:25:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Uniqueness, strength, and plan for action. Wonderful work, both of you, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be a witness. I appreciate it. 

02:26:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you Carlos. 

02:26:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN thank you. 

02:26:05
Introduction to the Five-Stage Interview 

02:26:10
Allen E. Ivey 

02:26:10
and 

02:26:10
Dominiqua Monica Griffen 

02:26:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Allen is about to present a live demonstration of a five stage interview. A model that you will find workable in many settings and with many theories but before we get to the session, let's review the five stages of the interview model. The first is having an empathic relationship with your client. It includes, initiating the session, building rapport and structuring the interview. The second stage is story and strength. Here the counselor gathers the data, drawing out the client's stories, concerns, challenges and strengths. The third stage, is mutual goal setting. In this stage, the counselor ask the question, what do you want to have happen? The fourth stage is Restory. This is working with the client to explore alternatives to the issues, confronting incongruities and then conflict and then restoring and the final stage is action. This is when a counselor concludes a session and helps the clients to generalize and take action to the new stories. This five stage interview model can be used regardless of your theoretical orientation. But note that each theory will be used a bit differently. For example, relationships are generally most important in a client centered to approach. So you may spend more time in the relationship stage. If your orientation is brief therapy, then goal setting maybe emphasized more. The stages do not have to follow an order because each client has different needs. But relationship and goal setting are essential. Now, let's get back to Allen and his interview Dominiqua. He will include a focus on multicultural and social justice issues. Notice how he brings them back into the session.

02:28:25
Stage 1: Rapport and Structuring 

02:28:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Here we are now for our third session Dominiqua. Uh… before we start, I need to say a few things. First of all, as always, there are videotaping, if you, anything you want to stop and particularly important, I think it's pretty clear that you're talking not about some role played issue or problem or concern, you're talking about real life things. 

02:28:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:28:55
ALLEN E. IVEY And so all of more important, that you say, that's enough. Okay, and then uh… this is the five stage interview and I find it very helpful to talk about, first of all, relationship and sort of structuring the sessions on structuring the session and we've already worked in the last two sessions pretty much, a relationship uh…but the next second dimension in the story and strengths. I want to begin with some of the stories of your concerns if that's okay and then we'll bring in the strengths which we kind of know a good deal about already and then the third stage is goals. 

02:29:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay. 

02:29:35
ALLEN E. IVEY And finally then, then it goes to exploration, brainstorming uh… alternatives for action etc. and then commitment to action. What are we going to do about all of this? So that's, that's what kind of happens as the structure is of and I think it's kind of fits with what you're, we've been talking about. 

02:30:00
Stage 2: gathering information Stories and Strengths 

02:30:05
Open Question 

02:30:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I'd like to begin the session with what stood out for you from the first session and from the community Genograms session? What stood up for you personally? 

02:30:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, umm… so begin able to come in and talk about the burnout that I'm experiencing. 

02:30:20
ALLEN E. IVEY the burnout. 

02:30:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, umm… and then… referring to like, how like my family kind of plays into that and help me but also contribute as well as what's happening on the news uh… and then being in this far along in the program umm… and what that has meant for me. 

02:30:45
Open Question 

02:30:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Now, tell me a little about the program, I didn't quite hear that. 

02:30:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And being in the program like this far along in the program, what that has meant for me so far like along the way. 

02:30:50
Summary 

02:30:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Three things, okay, uh… let's hear a little bit more about the, the burnout and your concern, uh…the support from the family but then the pressure. 

02:31:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, so… 

02:31:05
ALLEN E. IVEY And, where would you like to take this burnout thing? 

02:31:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay, so… this is my third year in the program and I also have a duel title that I'm getting so that has caused me to have to take more classes. 

02:31:20
ALLEN E. IVEY A dual title? 

02:31:25
Attending with many minimal encourages 

02:31:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, so I'm in counselor education but also with a dual title in comparative and international education. Yes, so because of that I've had to take extra classes to make sure that I meet the requirements for both programs umm… so… last year, I took all like, five classes a semester as a doc student still having a grad assistantship and then co-teaching as well. 

02:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Can you hear me? [raspy gasp] 

02:32:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:32:00
ALLEN E. IVEY I get some, I'm feeling myself a burnout might come, go ahead. 

02:32:05
Burn out as central issue 

02:32:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, umm… and then this semester uh… well, it's been like constant like, since the first year as well, I want to say my second semester in the program, that's when I started taking the five classes and then I still take classes like in the summer time as well but over the, this past summer I just helped to co teach. Umm… two classes, so there was never like a real break. Umm… and now this semester, it's been pretty much the same thing. So I have four classes umm… interning, I have my GA also, helping t0 co-teach and then, I'm supervising a student as well. So, I mentioned my client, I have a client that I see… 

02:32:55
Restatement. 

02:32:55
ALLEN E. IVEY A client and a client too in your spare time. 

02:33:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN that I see in the clinic umm… so just balancing all of that uh… and then I'm active in the Black Graduate Student Association and in CORED, which is another committee on campus umm… that advises the president of the university umm… on issues related to race and ethnicity and diversity. So, being involved in all of these different programs and still trying to maintain like a healthy lifestyle umm… has definitely been a struggle and now I'm just like okay. 

02:33:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

02:33:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Dominiqua, get it together. 

02:33:45
Paraphrase; exploration of feelings 

02:33:45
ALLEN E. IVEY You got me out of breath while listening to you. So, I really hear an immensely busy schedule probably, is busy, busier than any graduate student I've ever run into. But that's left you feeling… 

02:33:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Exhausted. 

02:33:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Exhausted. 

02:34:00
More cause for burnout 

02:34:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Especially like the semester with the election in this kind of ties into what's happening like in the news and media uh… with, with hearing everything umm… that's happening on the news, it's just like okay. You know, I need to do, I need to make sure that I'm taking care of business in terms of my academic career but then it's also this pressure of so now what are you going to do for the community like now that you've been given, given this you know, experience so… and also like internalizing how people started, also internalizing like how people are understanding me or preserving me. 

02:34:45
Summary 

02:34:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I see that in addition, to this incredibly busy schedule. You've also had the burden of, ‘what am I going to do?' Going from the here and now being busy, adding to this running around your head, what am I going to do with all of this, a fear feeling of responsibility or what? 

02:35:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would definitely say responsibility uh… and the need to make sure the bad it gets done. 

02:35:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Make a need to make sure it gets done. 

02:35:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:35:20
Focus on strengths 

02:35:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm, keep in mind the strengths we were talking about earlier… I think, when you're talking like that, you didn't feel quite sure of yourself right now, because you're asking an awful lot of yourself aren't you? 

02:35:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:35:35
ALLEN E. IVEY What do you think of a person that asked that much of themselves? 

02:35:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I mean, I thought, I mean, it goes along with it. So, asking, asking so much of myself but then making sure that I'm able to deliver so, it's overwhelming. 

02:35:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

02:35:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… and sometimes frustrating if I'm not able to get to everything that I planned to get to. 

02:36:00
Summarization of feelings and open questions 

02:36:00
ALLEN E. IVEY But let's imagine out here that you're either looking at yourself or at some, some client that said more or less what you're saying that feeling overwhelmed, burnout, responsibility, strong person, what might you say to them? 

02:36:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would tell them to take time for themselves. 

02:36:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah-huh! 

02:36:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah. So, I need to listen to my own words. 

02:36:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

02:36:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN And see what does that look like for me. 

02:36:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's very hard to help others, if you don't help yourself. 

02:36:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:36:35
Underneath Allen's listening approach is a constant watch for issues of conflict. In this case, internal conflict of caring for self and for others. 

02:36:35
Watch carefully as he responds to Dominiqua and how he points out contradictions she is living with. Let's watch that example again. 

02:36:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would tell them to take time for themselves. 

02:36:55
ALLEN E. IVEY Ah-huh! 

02:37:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, yeah, so… I need to listen to my own words uh… and see what does that look like for me. 

02:37:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So it's very hard to help others if you don't help yourself. 

02:37:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes. 

02:37:15
Summary of strengths and resources with check out 

02:37:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I hear Dominiqua, a person immensely talented, if you don't mind me saying that uh… deeply committed… 

02:37:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:37:25
ALLEN E. IVEY …a solid supportive background, but a solid supportive background that is also a bit demanding and feeds into your own desire, is that right? 

02:37:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:37:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So they're both supportive but they're a little bit of a problem as well. 

02:37:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah and not, not like a, not like a negative problem but just like, an added pressure. 

02:37:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And you feel responsibility to the community. 

02:37:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN But also to them. 

02:37:55
ALLEN E. IVEY to them. 

02:37:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Definitely to them. 

02:38:00
Summary of strengths 

02:38:00
ALLEN E. IVEY And so there you are. Now, given that, let's just think for the so put that together kind of summarize as you've told me so much in terms of what you're doing, you saw me going, ‘oh my god.' 

02:38:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:38:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh… like I say, that that's very impressive, very impressive. I hear you are loud and clear, your commitment. I hear you're treasuring your family, your relationship with God and you may not be relating to God exactly like your family wants to, but I still feel that feeling that you have the surrounding you, so you still have that support. 

02:38:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:38:40
ALLEN E. IVEY I just want to push beneath it, yeah, so you have that. 

02:38:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:38:45
ALLEN E. IVEY So you have that wonderful strength. Uh… you also have that feeling of achievement. 

02:38:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:38:55
ALLEN E. IVEY I see some pride there. You don't like the word pride maybe, but I see a little prideness there. 

02:39:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I'm definitely very grateful. 

02:39:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Grateful? 

02:39:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:39:05
ALLEN E. IVEY You know, you're aware that you're proud of what you're done but you're aware that you haven't done it alone. 

02:39:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, definitely. Like, I didn't know for sure that I would not be in its position if it wasn't for my family, so… 

02:39:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Then your community, that's a very few people that would say, most people would like to say in this country, I did it, I hear you saying, we are doing it. 

02:39:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:39:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that's right? 

02:39:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, definitely. 

02:39:35
Reflection of feeling 

02:39:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Very impressive, I like that a lot. So in terms of strength, I kind of, we've heard this, the story and the concern, the strengths are just all over the place, in terms of even going to New York, the strength to deal with the tension that New York brings and the overwhelm but it's also some positive feelings in New York. Uh… the strength of incredible support, uh… the strength of achievement, uh… the strength of connection. 

02:40:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:40:10
Summary of treasuring family and culture 

02:40:10
ALLEN E. IVEY Strength of commitment and we haven't said this, I think that a sense of treasuring the African-American culture. 

02:40:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:40:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Is that accurate? 

02:40:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Definitely. 

02:40:20
ALLEN E. IVEY I sense that, so there's just an immense amount of strengths, which by the way, puts on the more pressure. 

02:40:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:40:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I understand that so, it's a two edged sword but I see a lot of strength. 

02:40:30
Note that the story of pressure and burnout has moved to positive strengths and ability to deal with issues. 

02:40:40
Summary and goal oriented question 

02:40:40
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, so we've got a story, we have a lot of strengths uh… what you see is as a goal for yourself that comes out. By the way, we also heard a concern, I'm not taking care of myself. 

02:40:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:40:55
ALLEN E. IVEY So, what might your goals be, given what we said so far? 

02:41:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN ...To realistically, try to figure out how I can carve out time for myself. 

02:41:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I'd like that as a first response. 

02:41:15
Conflict between family and need to work 

02:41:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… yeah but what is realistic umm… so it's the end of the semester so now it seems more tangible but I also start my exams soon so… yeah, so, yeah, yeah, like, this might be the first time that, I just missed thanksgiving with my family which was the first holiday that I missed with them umm… and now it's like, okay Christmas is coming up and my grandfather's birthday it's on new years but going to New York from Christmas to New Years would be entirely too long when I need to take my exam. So now, I'm trying to figure out, should I go to New York for Christmas or for my grandfather's birthday and that's pretty much like something else that's coming up because it's like… 

02:42:10
STAGE 4: Exploring alternatives and generating solutions. 

02:42:10
ALLEN E. IVEY You don't feel you can do both. 

02:42:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No, I know like, I'll need to be in my space to write and get work done umm… and out there I'll be with my family and then it's like, okay, I can just put this off, I'll work on it tonight. I'll work on it tomorrow, first thing in the morning and then you know, that day is that I need to really focus on my work so… 

02:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Not a lot of space left for you. 

02:42:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No. 

02:42:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Sound like you plan some space. 

02:42:35
This is a frequent conflict with many people. The desire to be oneself and have fun vs. the need to keep up with work. The client feels "torn" 

02:42:45
Open Question 

02:42:45
ALLEN E. IVEY I guess, I'd ask, when you're with your family, are you able to be with your family or are you thinking, I really ought to be working? 

02:42:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Sometimes, I do feel guilty umm… like, if I'm home for too long and I'm just like, no, you know like, I know that I need to get work done, I'd probably be more productive if I was in my writing space like, where usually right. But then, other times I'm just like no, you know like, I do need to give myself some time. It's the same feeling like, when I go to work out sometimes I'll go to the gym and I'm just like, "Oh! These hours that I could have been getting work done." But in my mind I know that working out would help with relieving stress then and all of that like I get that but it's still like talking to myself and saying these things like really acknowledging that it's okay. 

02:43:45
Paraphrase 

02:43:45
ALLEN E. IVEY Those, most of the time you can focus but frequently you're on the gym and saying, what am I going to do about that next paragraph and that does it ever happen when you're working on that next paragraph or at the keyboard, you're thinking I really should be doing this, I really should be taking care of myself? 

02:44:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes. 

02:44:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Well, all right. I kind of say this is a classic, if you don't mind my saying so, that you're not alone in that issue. Personally every student I've known has that feeling is that, they get guilty about having fun so doesn't allow them to have fun and then they get working and say, ‘I don't like this.' 

02:44:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:44:30
ALLEN E. IVEY But I hear you making a major commitment to work and to what your responsibilities are. 

02:44:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:44:35
Question about balance between caring and work requirements 

02:44:35
ALLEN E. IVEY How do you feel about a person that does make that commitment to really a central commitment to others, I hear that? 

02:44:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, umm… I guess it just, everyone has their role. Umm… so I've acknowledged like that's my role umm… so… I'm okay with that, but then I'm just like, I know, I still, I still want to see my family, I still want to take care of my self. So just trying to find that balance but then like when, I think about it is balance really equal right. Some times, some things are, are umm… increased in other areas, and other areas are much lower. So that's why when I think about balance is really like, okay. It's never quite equal. 

02:45:30
Interpretation/feedback 

02:45:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh… when you say that, it kind of reminds me of Martin Luther King. He so much wanted to be with this family and very close. 

02:45:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:45:40
ALLEN E. IVEY And yet he had a mission and I don't say you're Martin Luther King, but I sense a little similarity. How does that sound to you? 

02:45:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I would definitely say so, I've never been compared to, but I'll take it. 

02:45:55
ALLEN E. IVEY When you see this, how the structures some are? 

02:46:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yes. 

02:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Very similar goals in life. 

02:46:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yeah. 

02:46:00
ALLEN E. IVEY Very similar. 

02:46:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:46:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Very similar. 

02:46:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

02:46:10
Feedback 

02:46:10
ALLEN E. IVEY I have to say and posted to listening where I'm deeply impressed. 

02:46:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

02:46:15
ALLEN E. IVEY But in terms of specific goals, sound like there's a deep commitment to continue the path. 

02:46:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:46:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That's when your goal says, ‘hey this is the path and I'm feeling good about it.' 

02:46:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:46:25
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay, let's take the other part, how can you feel better about being at the gym, the time your home and how can you make that a little better for yourself? 

02:46:40
This is a classic supportive confrontation. The desire to meet responsibility vs. the desire to still care for oneself, followed by a question. Look at that lead again. 

02:46:50
ALLEN E. IVEY Let's take the other part, how can you feel better about being at the gym, the time you're home and uh… how can you make that a little better for yourself? 

02:47:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:47:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Hiking, I think, whatever, what can you do to make yourself, give yourself a little more leeway and room because, you already said, you know you do a better job, if you take-if you don't take care of yourself, you can't take care of others right. 

02:47:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:47:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Okay. 

02:47:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Like really, processing that that it's true. Uh… like I know it, but knowing it to be true. 

02:47:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Um-hmm. 

02:47:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN That's pretty much where I think it's more of the umm… like, mental aspect of it, like really processing that umm… and then, like what I can do in the physical sense, would just be like, I guess telling myself these things umm… like, positive self talk and I said it's uh… and, and then still doing it like, making sure that I write, write it down into the schedule and then let myself go into that space. 

02:48:15
Paraphrase and Open Question 

02:48:15
ALLEN E. IVEY I mean, kind of processing, what we might do, I heard you saying, write down a little tighter schedule to do this, what else occurs you to make a little better for yourself? 

02:48:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Like holding myself accountable to make sure that I, that I actually do take the time out to do. 

02:48:30
Building a balance 

02:48:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Well accountable, that to take time to enjoy yourself. I'll give you an A+ for that, if you do it. You know that, you can make having fun and accountable issue. 

02:48:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, like really building it and I remember, I was in this program in undergrad and we had mandatory fun that was like part of the schedule and you know, like I remember, when we fought and screamed like no, we have to work on this, we had to do this and they were like, ‘no, everyone has to come out here,' it was a field day activity and I was like, ‘oh okay, this make sense'. Umm… so thinking back on that, I would need to include like mandatory fun for myself, uh…but really just, okay, it can't like, it will not be for the full day, maybe it's a couple of hours here, 15 minutes there but making sure that it actually gets done so… 

02:49:25
ALLEN E. IVEY You do any meditation at all? 

02:49:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… I used to… but I haven't. 

02:49:35
ALLEN E. IVEY Something like prayer serves as a meditation too. 

02:49:35
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yeah, so sometimes, yes, yeah. 

02:49:40
ALLEN E. IVEY So quiet time can be a place of refreshment too. Meditation, prayer, not doing a lot. 

02:49:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:49:50
ALLEN E. IVEY And that's another possibility. 

02:49:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:49:50
ALLEN E. IVEY So that sound like a very good broad plan. 

02:49:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:50:00
STAGE 5: Action: Taking the interview home. What will the client do differently tomorrow and the next week? 

02:50:05
ALLEN E. IVEY So, let's move to stage five, what you're going to do tomorrow in this week? 

02:50:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Tomorrow, I have a final and I'll be interning tomorrow so… after the final, I can go to the gym. I've already contacted my gym buddy actually, my stomach might be talking more so that… 

02:50:30
ALLEN E. IVEY So after all of that, you're going to the gym. 

02:50:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:50:35
Open Question 

02:50:35
ALLEN E. IVEY That's not a bad plan for tomorrow, I would also sort of say, what am I gonna say there, uh… what is fun in the actual stuff that you're going to do that you, is part of your, there must be some part of your actual work that's fun and stimulating for you, what is that? 

02:50:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN umm… I would say… I really do look forward to the individual sessions that I have with students, umm… and then like helping to co-teach to different classes… 

02:51:05
ALLEN E. IVEY I didn't quite hear that last one. 

02:51:05
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Helping to co-teach the classes and engage in an… 

02:51:10
Reforming/directive searching for the positive in required tasks 

02:51:10
ALLEN E. IVEY So, there's lot of satisfaction, even though the demanding, you get a lot of satisfaction. 

02:51:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, definitely. 

02:51:20
ALLEN E. IVEY You think, you could focus on some of the satisfactions rather than, I've got to get to help professors so and so. 

02:51:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:51:20
ALLEN E. IVEY Isn't fun that I can help professor so and so! 

02:51:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, yeah. 

02:51:20
ALLEN E. IVEY It's a little bit of reframing, a lot of what you're already doing. 

02:51:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:51:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Could build, I mean, you still pressure but it could build more satisfaction and maybe make work a little more fun rather than, ‘oh my god this treadmill.' 

02:51:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:51:40
ALLEN E. IVEY can you hear me. 

02:51:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yeah. 

02:51:40
ALLEN E. IVEY How do you respond to that? 

02:51:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, that makes more sense. They're just like, I'm like, yes, that's a different way to think about it and like I know that the work that I do gives me satisfaction but I don't necessarily mention that part of it like, on the day to day. 

02:52:00
ALLEN E. IVEY You do that in your self-talk. 

02:52:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, I definitely need to include that. 

02:52:05
Open Question 

02:52:05
ALLEN E. IVEY You've got a lot of self talk, tell me just a little bit more about yourself talk before we wind up. I need to understand that, just a little bit more. 

02:52:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Okay, uh… so… randomly, if I see, if I feel like, okay, I'm getting myself worked up, I'll say like, okay, no, it's okay, you'll be okay, Dominiqua… 

02:52:30
Exploring balance between work, family, and fun 

02:52:30
ALLEN E. IVEY You're already managing your self talk. I didn't know that, that is another strength. Continue doing managing yourself thought but also add a little self talk about, ‘hey this is not as bad and this is this part of this is fun. Do you think we can find any fun at exam tomorrow? I've given you a challenge. 

02:52:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, okay. 

02:52:50
ALLEN E. IVEY What might be, what might be good in the exam tomorrow? 

02:52:55
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Uh… knowing that, it's one of, it will actually be my last class. 

02:53:00
ALLEN E. IVEY It's a good one. 

02:53:00
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… yeah, so like, knowing that I'll be finished with my coursework but then, umm… getting to write down like, what I've been studying in the process, so get into relief umm… 

02:53:15
ALLEN E. IVEY So, I hear you've got some ideas for self care. 

02:53:20
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:53:20
ALLEN E. IVEY And that doesn't mean you're going to, you're going to continue to work on these really troubling issues and if we just spoke about the really troubling issues, they can become truly overwhelming and yet a piece at a time can make a huge difference and along with that is the strength and the wisdom to say, I will take care of myself. Okay, what stood out from you, from the session today? 

02:53:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Umm… definitely the reframing up it all like, I know that I'm enjoying what I do, but just making sure that I acknowledge that part of it umm… more often umm… and then like, realizing the strength that comes along with umm… referring back to the different like, parts of the soul like my family and like thinking about the community. 

02:54:20
ALLEN E. IVEY That expression of, I can say kind of expression of, sometimes the stuff you do is the expression of warmth. Isn't that wonderful. 

02:54:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes. 

02:54:25
ALLEN E. IVEY God's will. 

02:54:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm. 

02:54:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, nice. 

02:54:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

02:54:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Thank you very much. 

02:54:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, thank you. 

02:54:35
The 5-stage session concludes and was completed with near 100% listening skills. 

02:54:45
5-Stage Interview Debrief 

02:54:45
Allen, Dominiqua and Carlos 

02:54:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT We just completed the, the demonstration for the 5 stages of the interview and I have a umm… sort of, I sense, I sense that, you were able Allen, to follow every single one of the steps. But also the main focus was on the basic attending skills so, how to use the basic skills, not the influencing skills? How did you accomplish that, to stay with the basic attending skills and still complete the five stages of the interview? 

02:55:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Uh… basically, I didn't think about it that much, that of, but uh… I like to hear, I like to hear the story. I'm vitally interested in the interview, really interested and… whatever I said in terms of listening, it was just me. Uh… I wasn't, I could, I could go through it again and say, I, and I have done that, I can go through as, I'm going to use this skill, that's I'm able to do that, I didn't this time. Uh… I'd have to go back and say, well, this was, this was this skill and that was that skill and so forth, like they are not certain, they was not used in order. I have done interviews, where I have bang, bang, bang, done their skills in order and worked pretty, works very well. But, you know, just idea is that, I was interested, that helps, that helps you listen when you're interested. 

02:56:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Which it is an interesting dimension because listening per se, helps the therapist be engaged and become more and more interested, great point. How was it for you? I mean, share with us your experience with this session. 

02:56:40
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yes, I enjoyed working with Allen, I believe like, I felt listened to umm… and then he brought up some points that I didn't necessarily bring up in terms of what the Genogram really represents uh…and making that connection to… so what the work that I plan on doing, as well as, how it impacts me in my personal life umm… but then also bringing in like my culture and focusing on that and let that be at the forefront of the conversation, so, going back to you mentioned the African-American community that I want to work with and I didn't say that explicitly but he was able to call that out and it just felt like, okay, you know. He hears me in this moment umm… and it's really acknowledging what my personal experience is umm… because often times especially as the person of color uh… we're tied to a group and then the stereotype start to come in and all of the assumptions. So I really felt as if, he really listened to what my individual experience was or is currently. 

02:57:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So that goes a long your, your idea that we, we are raised in a community but we can still use all that experience and refocus on the particular person and listen to that person, particular story. 

02:58:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah, the community Genogram helps me understand uniqueness of the person better. Even though, I'm very interested multicultural social justice issues is that every person has a very unique background special to them. 

02:58:20
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT That was my sense that, you were able to follow her and sort of see the situation from her point of view and bring to that what the community Genogram was also help you perceive it, Am I correct to that? Very good. 

02:58:40
ALLEN E. IVEY It helped that she's such an integrated person however. 

02:58:45
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

02:58:45
ALLEN E. IVEY But on the other hand, for the person that maybe not as integrated as she is, this will help them over time integrate. 

02:58:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Yeah, so it's a tool that you can use on a particular session but also you can bring back throughout the whole therapeutic process. 

02:59:05
ALLEN E. IVEY Yeah. 

02:59:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very good. Now, have you ever done a community Genogram before? 

02:59:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No, I would consider a family genogram before but definitely not a community Genogram. So, it definitely adds to it because it then puts my family within the context of the community uh… and calls about other impacts that are involved in the community as well. So… seeing that in a broader sense, helps to pick up on other parts of the narrative that I haven't yet processed for myself uh… so going back to them the other parts not being fully integrated, I've been able to now like, see them as more of an integrative component and not separate things. 

02:59:50
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT So she was able to integrate a number of elements of her story but in addition to that, you were able to reframe and set specific ways in which she can help herself to cope with the demands of her vacation and activities and also carve out ways to help herself in terms of wellness. So that's a very umm… comprehensive set of goals. How do you manage to accomplish all that in the real move, a couple of sessions? 

03:00:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Hmm… I guess, all I can say is belief the person's community we need action, we need to act, uh… we need to look to the past uh… I appreciated her addition of self talk because I don't usually bring in self talk, I think it's very helpful and I probably will bring that in and use that in future. You always learn from working with clients, always learn. 

03:00:55
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT That was my sense, because I don't think that this is a pre-planned situation but it comes out… 

03:01:05
ALLEN E. IVEY It's a pre planned structure but it's not a preplanned situation. 

03:01:05
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT That's exactly the point and it becomes so rich that it makes in my mind to raise the importance of the, the use of a community Genogram in this session itself. So that's how, that was a wonderful experience. What would you like to say to Allen uh… about your experience working with him today? 

03:01:30
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN I really enjoyed working with you uh… like, I have stated before I felt heard even though you are of a different background, you were still able to hone in on what my personal experience was umm… and even your thoughts about the community but more so gear towards, how I'm being impacted? So I really felt like, the genuine focus was on me umm… and like really listening but you were able to tie some of the pieces together that I wasn't able to do initially and like that umm… movement that I had, I wasn't aware of it at first but then… as you kept drawing attention to it, I'm like, oh I had to do that often. So it just made me think, I wonder when I'm doing that out in the real world. Not just in session, when processing or working with clients talking to family, talking with friends umm… so it was definitely very helpful uh… in, in working with you, so thank you. 

03:02:35
ALLEN E. IVEY I do want to ask uh… for the end, I did some personal sharing about my experience with you. What was your experience, if that was a relevant or not? Maybe I shouldn't have done that? 

03:02:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN No, I think that it was relevant, it was interesting because umm… like, how did you navigate the space knowing that, this is the work that you do umm… but knowing that we exist on a continuum. So even if you weren't able, or you felt like speaking up in that moment was not, I guess, the best thing to do or you felt like you would be unheard… 

03:03:15
ALLEN E. IVEY Or shot at! 

03:03:15
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah, I h- well, yeah, that's a bigger issue but it, it resonated with me because I'm like okay, that's still present for me like, okay, I could speak up in these different spaces but there are times when I won't be heard. So, I definitely connected to that umm… but it seemed like you know you knew that, you did not have the same experience as me and you didn't acknowledge it as a privilege but I think that would probably have been like uh… 

03:03:45
ALLEN E. IVEY It is a privilege, I don't have to be there all the time. 

03:03:45
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN …Yeah, like yeah, and but knowing that you were still able to say and "I know that it's completely different for you but I can at least understand partial, partial component of what your experience is," and you mentioned it as being, like understanding a partial piece of it or component of it. So that was definitely helpful. 

03:04:10
ALLEN E. IVEY It is a very unwise, if I'd said, I felt exactly the same. 

03:04:10
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, um-hmm. 

03:04:15
ALLEN E. IVEY And I didn't feel exactly as that. I felt it kind of horrified but it isn't exactly the same because I could walk out of there and still be a white person with privilege. 

03:04:25
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Um-hmm, yeah. 

03:04:25
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT How interesting… 

03:04:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I can't escape privilege. 

03:04:30
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT As I was listening to both of you, I'm reminded of all the different levels of communication and integration of dimensions. You, you talk about self disclosure, the recognition of privilege, the capacity to umm… share your personal experience but also you work with cognitive elements like self talk. You, you work with their body, anchoring the specifics of the emotions on different parts of her body. You work with a community as a big umbrella wrapping up context. Umm… so it's a very integrated model, if I understand the, this correctly and also what would you like to say in closing to Dominiqua after working with her today? 

03:05:25
ALLEN E. IVEY I think maybe, a really important thing which I got from you just now is, what's going on in the client's mind while the counselor is talking? I was talking about the situation, you added the word privilege from your experience and probably wonder did I recognize my privilege. Did you? 

03:05:50
DOMINIQUA MONICA GRIFFIN Yeah. 

03:05:50
ALLEN E. IVEY See. And the thing is at that moment I didn't but I, when I think back, of course, of course. 

03:06:00
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT We're sure you have recent experiences. Uh… thank you both for the opportunity to… 

03:06:05
ALLEN E. IVEY We need to pay attention to the fact that the client is hearing different things and we're saying. 

03:06:10
CARLOS P. ZALAQUETT Very important, again, the listening is the central piece, thank you again. 

03:06:15
ALLEN E. IVEY You're welcome. 

03:06:20
Neuroscience and its Relationship to the Basic Attending Skills 

03:06:30
Build Resilience 

03:06:30
ALLEN E. IVEY Welcome again, this time I'd like to share a little bit about how basic attending skills relates to neuroscience and neurobiology. Up above you see counseling and social justice face a new future and that new future is we're going to bring neuroscience and neurobiology into direct counseling and clinical practice, which also means we need to think more broadly about family, community, culture and environmental context. So, what got me into this stuff, what got me in the neuroscience, brain plasticity, brain plasticity. Counseling changes the brain, counseling changes the brain. Your interview with the client will change neural connections, go through the synapses, affect dopamine neurotransmitters and you are changing the brain, if you are doing effective counseling, you're going to change the brain in positive ways. If you're doing sloppy counseling you may have no impact or you may even damage your client. Counseling changes the brain. We had a old idea that as you got older, you get neural loss. Yes, that does happen but the truth is, new lives plan brain plasticity and growth throughout our life. Old folks can still generate new neural nets, neurogenesis, it still happens. Positive plasticity, so the brain is the client's brain is plastic and you can do much to help them build on their strengths and go somewhere. There's also negative plasticity, the stress of all types and basic attending skills is very much concerned with dealing with stress. Poverty, abuse, racism, all of these cause a loss of brain volume. Trauma causes loss of brain volume. In the prefrontal cortex, you make executive decisions, this is where you regulate the emotions and you build cognitive reserve. The more cognitive reserve a person builds over a life span, the less alzheimers of the better mental and physical helps. Now, working on the P.F.C. and executive decision defined as a paraphrase encourage and summary, those skills are particularly ordered to the P. F. C. The limbic I guess also is where the feelings are reflection of feeling, activation of emotion, memory protective system, body regulation as reflection of feeling skill. Stressful experiences disengage the frontal lobes of P. F.C. which over time leads to, these are things you're going to see in counseling folks. Impulsivity, shortsightedness, aggressive behavior, stress builds aggressive behavior, stress builds increase anxiety, stressed is a key factor in depression, stress is a key factor in heart attacks, stress is a key factor in many disorders and diseases. Stress leads to alcohol and drug abuse. You do wonderful work on alcohol rehab, the client runs and do extreme stress or moderate stress, the next thing you know, they're back to drinking. So, stress management is really critical and the basic of stress management is listening and helping the client make their own decision. Counseling does actually change the brain. Research in Japan has shown that, listening lights up the brain. Guess what, not listening dulls the brain. Listening helps us access emotions, strengthens the P.F.C. and listening actually changes bodily function. We get more positive things happen to body when you listen. It reduces the stress by itself. So our goal finally, is to build resilience, we got to search for positive stories, strengths and supports. Attending behavior, our first skill builds relationships and safety. You want the client to feel safe in the interview. It also diffuses problems and issues. Questions seriously work will help us to see how we bring our client stories. We solve our problems by what we can do, avoiding focusing too long on difficulties. Paraphrasing and summarizing will focus on the P.F.C. and decision making. Reflection of feeling which we do with Mary, work on the limbic and emotional regulation, emotional development and in the five stages, I'll show you how to develop a well formed interview and in final word, never forget to search for strengths. Resilience, resilience, resilience, build resilience, search for positive stories, strength and support. Thanks for taking time with me, that's a very quick overview of neuroscience, there's a lots more to learn, I hope your learn more. Take care.
