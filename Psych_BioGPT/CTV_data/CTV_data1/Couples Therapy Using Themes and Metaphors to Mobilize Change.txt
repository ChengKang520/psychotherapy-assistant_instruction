and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal, and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

PEGGY PAPP THERAPIST 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. Welcome to Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I'm Diane Kjos and this is our guest Peggy Papp, who's going to talk to us today about systemic brief couple therapy. Peggy, to begin with, how do you define brief therapy? 

00:02:10
PEGGY PAPP Well, uh, in my terms it's, uh, just therapy that is very focused, uh, and done within, uh, 10 to 12 sessions. 

00:02:20
DIANE KJOS Oh, okay. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Well, help us understand your approach and just how it works. 

00:02:30
PEGGY PAPP My approach is based on understanding individual belief systems, and the way they interlock to form themes that govern relationships. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:02:40
1-1 

00:02:40
1-2 

00:02:40
Peggy Papp, M.S.W. 

00:02:40
PEGGY PAPP Um, when two people come together, they bring with them a whole set of beliefs about, uh, love, marriage, sex, closeness, distance, parenting, how men should behave, how women should behave, how husbands should behave, and wives. And, um, this, these beliefs form the very structure of their relationship. The quality of their relationship is based on the way these beliefs either conflict or complement each other, the way that a couple negotiates their differences and their beliefs, their attitudes. Uh, and I think that the beliefs remain very powerful unless they are recognized, they maintain their power by people being unaware of them. And, uh, then they begin to govern peoples' lives, and relationships, in ways, um, that can be, um, problematic and conflictual. Um, so that it's important, I think, to define those beliefs that, um, are constructive and those beliefs that are constraining, and... 

00:04:00
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) So that would be the purpose in the way you approach works is to really focus in on those beliefs? And try to... 

00:04:05
1-3 

00:04:05
PEGGY PAPP (crosstalk) Yes, yes. To understand, and, and by beliefs, um, of course there are many different kinds of beliefs. I mean there are political beliefs, and social beliefs, and cultural beliefs, and religious beliefs. So, uh, it's very important to choose the beliefs that are relevant to the presenting problem. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:25
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

00:04:25
1-3 

00:04:25
PEGGY PAPP So I, I ask myself as I go through the interviews, uh, what, first I ask myself, what is it that they want to change, um, what is it that is preventing the change, what is the attitudes, beliefs, assumptions, behavior, that is preventing the change, and um, then try to introduce in some way an alternate way of seeing things, believing. 

00:04:55
1-4 

00:04:55
DIANE KJOS Mm-hmm, how did you come to this? Tell us a little bit about how you evolved, how this therapy came to be, or this approach that you use. 

00:05:05
1-5 

00:05:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, during the process of my career I have tried many, many different approaches. Um, I remember that, um, I could not get into social work school because they thought that I would not be serious about my work. And so the first job that I got was in the welfare department, um, where I had 200 cases, and uh, I think that I learned to be very resilient and, uh, very, um, flexible, uh, in my approach. Uh, but, uh, uh, after I had done that, uh, they took me into social work school and, um, I had seen a tape of Nathan Acroman's when I was in, uh, the welfare department, and I said to myself, that's what I want to do. 

00:06:05
DIANE KJOS Ahh. 

00:06:05
PEGGY PAPP I didn't know what he did or why he did it but I just knew it was very powerful. Um, when I got out of social work school he had not started his institute yet, and so I applied, uh, for training, uh, at his place. Um, he did start the institute and I was the first social worker hired there. 

00:06:30
JON CARLSON That's the Acroman Institute in New York. 

00:06:30
1-6 

00:06:30
PEGGY PAPP Right, right. Um, his approach you might call, very psychodynamic, uh, uh, I learned from him I think, how to follow the emotional flow in the family. Uh, and then, uh, one of my students brought me a book by Murray Bowen, and said, hey, hey, here is a real solid theory to family therapy. And so, um, I for many years, practiced the Bowen approach and formed the Center for Family Learning with Phil Garren, and Tom Fortino, and... 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON Yeah, sure, uh-huh. 

00:07:15
PEGGY PAPP ...Betty Carter. And, uh, then, though, I felt that, um, I wanted an approach where I could deal more practically with current issues. And so, uh, I was hired in Philadelphia child guidance clinic, uh, to teach there. 

00:07:35
JON CARLSON Oh, boy. 

00:07:35
1-7 

00:07:35
1-8 

00:07:35
PEGGY PAPP And, uh, I began observing Sam Nugent and Dan Haley, and I began experimenting with paradoxical approach. And, uh, then I heard that, uh, in Milan they were doing a systemic paradoxical approach, so I, uh, um, went to Milan and observed them working there, and, um, came back and formed the brief therapy project at the Egmont Institute along with August Silverstene. And, uh, for about 8 years we worked with families who had a systematic child in the, um, paradoxical, what you might call Milan style of therapy. But then, um, I became interested in, um, the women's movement, and, um, Mary Anne Walters, Betty Carter, and August Silverstene, and I formed the women's project family therapy. And, um, we examined the, you know, gender beliefs and the sexist practices in the field, and in order to do that we had to become aware of our own beliefs. And, uh, it made me aware of what a profound affect your beliefs have. 

00:09:00
DIANE KJOS Ah, so that's how you started with beliefs. 

00:09:00
PEGGY PAPP On your relationships, and on your life, and, um how if you think a different way, if you can change some of those beliefs, uh, what a difference it can make. And then I just began applying that to my work with families. Uh, I'm noticing more, and exploring more, uh, their belief systems, and, uh, how it was effecting their lives, um, either for better or for worse, and then helping them to try and change those beliefs. Um... 

00:09:40
JON CARLSON So, so this approach is one that's really integrated from many different people. It's come out of Bowen, and Acroman, and Haley, and Nugent, and Carter, and Silverstene. 

00:09:50
1-9 

00:09:50
PEGGY PAPP Yes, and, and the way that I learned was, uh, I would totally absorb one way of working. I would read, uh, either Haley, or Milan, or (inaudible )... 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON (crosstalk) Sure. 

00:10:05
PEGGY PAPP ...and I would go in and I would try to practice it, I would watch myself, I would make video tapes, and then little by little I would discard what was not useful, to me, or what did not make sense, or did not feel good within my style. So that I have, I have still, um, I've kept the pieces of those, all of those approaches that I have felt were valid and made sense to me that I felt were effective. 

00:10:30
JON CARLSON Is that the way change takes place in your approach? The approach when you work with couples too, you know, introduce them to ideas and have them and keep what works and discard what doesn't? 

00:10:45
PEGGY PAPP Well, I never thought of putting it that way, but that's a good way to put it. Yes. 

00:10:50
JON CARLSON And, but... Go ahead. 

00:10:50
1-10 

00:10:50
PEGGY PAPP Well, I also use, uh, for instance Murray Bowen's ideas about extended family, and doing genograms, and how important historical information is, uh, I explore people's beliefs, uh, and their family of origin, source of them, where do they come from. Um, I try and, um, I try and make the familiar beliefs seem strange because we, uh, we accept beliefs in such a way that we think there's no other way of thinking. And so, um, when I ask questions in families of origin, and where the beliefs come from, it's always, well, where did you get those ideas, and who else in your family had those ideas, and how did those ideas evolve, and how did people relate to them. And, so I, I would say that I have kept, from all of the different approaches, um, certain aspects that have seemed useful to me. 

00:11:55
1-11 

00:11:55
DIANE KJOS Well, it's almost as if you have had, sort of, taken what are my beliefs, or what are your beliefs, and then looked at what's going on and integrated those, what works. 

00:12:10
PEGGY PAPP Well, yes, yes, and I've become much more aware too of, uh, the importance of cultural beliefs, and, uh, how we're brainwashed by the mass media, and by our times, and, you know, the prevalent ideas of our times, by our peers. 

00:12:30
JON CARLSON So many of these things that we've treat as facts, are the beliefs that you're referring to, that need to be really understood as beliefs that can be changed? 

00:12:40
PEGGY PAPP Yes, and, and once people become aware of them then they have to option of which ones they want to keep and which ones they want to change. 

00:12:45
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:50
JON CARLSON Well, with your work is there a structure, or are there steps or stages that you follow when you start working with a couple or a family? 

00:12:55
1-12 

00:12:55
1-13 

00:13:00
PEGGY PAPP Uh, yes. Um, I first ask myself, what do they want changed, not what I want changed, or what I think should be changed, but what do they want changed. So that would, that is my mandate as a therapist, to try to help them to change in the way that they want to change. Then I ask, uh, then what are the beliefs, or attitudes, or behavior that interfere with their desire to change. Uh, how can I introduce a different beliefs, attitudes, or perceptions, uh, which of course is the art of therapy. Uh, then I, I also look for hidden resources, uh, always, because I think that people are not aware of a lot of the resources that they have, and a lot of the strengths. Um, I also look for exceptions, like when didn't you have the problem, or when was it different, or when were you able to be caring, or when did you feel differently about yourself, or, always exceptions. Um, I, uh, try to find behavior in terms of, uh, undesirable behavior, in terms of the bad habits rather than labeling it as something pathological. Um, and the other, the last step is that, um, I always try to summarize at the end of a session, what my understanding is of where they want to go, uh, how they want to get there, and if, whether or not we're in synced, whether or not I'm really understanding what it is that they want. 

00:14:45
1-14 

00:14:45
JON CARLSON So the process begins with, first of all, finding what they want, looking at the beliefs that keep them from getting what they want, introducing some new beliefs, focusing on their existing strengths, and maybe some of the exceptions where they actually do get what they want, and then, uh, introducing these new beliefs and summarizing. 

00:15:10
PEGGY PAPP Right. Right, mm-hmm. And following those beliefs, uh, source of their beliefs and the family of origin. 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON Okay. So it's not just their beliefs it's how they acquired these beliefs in a larger context? 

00:15:20
PEGGY PAPP Yes, because that helps them to, uh, begin to question some of the beliefs. You know, like, where do these come from, do other people have these beliefs, did people in your family have them, how do they affect the other people in your family. 

00:15:35
DIANE KJOS So that was, that kind of gets to my next question is, how do you bring in new beliefs, and how do you get them to change their beliefs? 

00:15:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, as I said, that's the art of therapy. 

00:15:40
DIANE KJOS That's the art of therapy, yeah. 

00:15:45
PEGGY PAPP There are many, many different ways that you can do it. Um... 

00:15:50
DIANE KJOS The questioning is part of that. 

00:15:50
1-15 

00:15:50
PEGGY PAPP You, you can question, you, you can challenge, uh, you can get their mate, uh, to challenge the belief, you know, by saying, gee, what, how does that belief affect their partner. Um, uh, you, you can also do it by, um, uh, giving them certain tasks, uh, where for instance they would go home and they would maybe write down, or document, when they believe to certain things, what effect that had on their partner, or how they acted when they believed a certain thing. Like I might say, one day I would like you to go home and I would like you to act as though you believed this, which could be their belief, and I'd like you to notice, uh, how it, your mate, or children, or whoever it is, respond, and on the next day I would like you to act as though you believed this, this is your belief, and see what the difference is, and see how other people respond to you, and how you respond. 

00:16:55
1-16 

00:16:55
JON CARLSON Yeah, okay. Let me ask the male question, you know, the bottom line question, does it work? Is there research that supports this approach? 

00:17:10
PEGGY PAPP Um, I have not done any research that supports this approach, and uh, I don't know of, uh, any recent research that has been done. 

00:17:15
Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed. D., ABPP 

00:17:20
JON CARLSON There are research that's done though on Bowen, and (inaudible ), and on these other components of your approach that show the effectiveness of those approaches? 

00:17:30
1-16 

00:17:30
PEGGY PAPP (crosstalk) Yes, yes, right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:17:35
DIANE KJOS Are, are there clients, or couples, that you would say, this isn't going to work or this is not a couple that I'm going to be able to work with? Are there people that this just doesn't work with? 

00:17:45
Peggy Papp, M.S.W. 

00:17:45
1-17 

00:17:45
PEGGY PAPP Um, I need longer with people who are depressed, uh, in my experience anyway, I have not been effective in a short period of time with people who are depressed. And I need to feel that, um, um, I have more leeway, uh, uh, in following them for a longer period of time. So I would say for me that would be the main category. Unless it is somebody, uh, for example, who needs residential, some kind of a residential, uh, treatment such as for alcoholism, or something like that. But, you know, no other than that I have found it to be effective with everybody. 

00:18:40
DIANE KJOS All right. Well, in a moment we're going to watch you work with an interracial couple who seem to be dealing with some problems of responsibility, and who should do what, and so forth. Can you tell us a little bit about what goes through your mind before this interview, or before you start and interview of a, the first interview of a couple? 

00:19:00
PEGGY PAPP Well, actually nothing goes through my mind because I go in with a blank mind. 

00:19:00
DIANE KJOS Ahh. 

00:19:00
1-18 

00:19:05
PEGGY PAPP No, I, I'm serious, I know that it sounds strange, but I try and not to go in with any preconceived ideas. I want to hear it from them, I want to follow them, I want to understand where they're coming from, uh, I want to follow their logic, uh, I want to try and, um, um, really, um, not pass any judgment on their, their beliefs. Um, I do certainly, though, I have those other questions in the back of my mind that I told you about. Like, what, what is it that they want changed, and, uh, what is stopping them from changing, and, uh... 

00:19:50
JON CARLSON Well, is there anything our viewers should be looking for, specifically? 

00:19:55
PEGGY PAPP Well, I, I, um, I think it would be helpful, um, if they were looking for the beliefs, attitudes... 

00:20:05
JON CARLSON Of the couple? 

00:20:05
1-19 

00:20:05
PEGGY PAPP ...of the couple, um, that, uh, conflicted, that were complimentary, or that were constraining, that kept them from attaining their desired goal. Um, also for, um, the themes, maybe some of the overall themes, uh, in the relationship, such as survival, um, responsibility, as, uh, as I think you will see as you watch the tape. 

00:20:40
JON CARLSON So that's kind of looking at the clients, how about looking at you, what might they look in terms of what you're doing? 

00:20:45
1-20 

00:20:50
PEGGY PAPP Um, the, uh, particular kind of questions that I'm asking, I think, uh, my attitude I suppose too, which I try and just be curious, and, um, uh, also to pick up an anything that's positive and elaborate on it, uh, anything that, uh, they are doing, uh, any strength that they show, any resource that can be used for change, they can notice that, um, um. 

00:21:30
JON CARLSON Let's not wait any longer. Watch you do exciting work with this young couple. 

00:21:35
DIANE KJOS Interesting couple too, yes. 

00:21:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Anytime you're ready you can go ahead. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:21:45
2-1 

00:21:45
PEGGY PAPP Okay. So you say that you have never been in counseling before. 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN Right. Never. This is a first experience for me. Still kind of shaky, but, I think I'll get used to it sooner or later. 

00:22:05
PEGGY PAPP So, it, uh, makes you a little nervous to come here? 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Somewhat, somewhat explaining my problems to everyone. 

00:22:10
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN I'm just not one for doing all of that. I don't know why it's just, if I feel I can't solve it myself then maybe there's not a solution. 

00:22:20
PEGGY PAPP Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I think a lot of people feel that way. So how were you persuaded to come since you feel that way? 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN Me, because I know if there's something wrong and you need help you go get it, right? 

00:22:35
2-2 

00:22:35
PEGGY PAPP I see, I see. Well, so, you must pay a lot of attention to what she says, you must respect her opinion, huh? 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Yes, I do. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Somewhat. 

00:22:40
PEGGY PAPP You do? 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN I don't, I don't, I listen to everything she says. 

00:22:50
PEGGY PAPP Is that true? 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN No, he does in a way, he listens, but sometimes he'll listen, but it's just listening, you know? He'll take it in but he don't make no actions behind that. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN I see. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN He'll say, I heard you, and, you know, that's it. 

00:23:10
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN But, it's like he's trying, you know, and I see it. He does try, like, but that's why I wanted to come to counseling, you know, we need help, you know, we need like a mutual understanding there that we don't have. He has his ways and I have mine, and we're two different people, but we have to come, we have to meet somewhere in the middle. 

00:23:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, what do you feel you need the mutual understanding about? 

00:23:30
2-3 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN Just, like, things that he wants out of our relationship and things that I want, we have to, like, bring them together, I don't know. 

00:23:45
UNKNOWN It's like, things that I expect from her I don't receive and vice versa. Things that she expects from me I don't receive, and we're trying to meet in the middle, but for some reason we keep going, crossing each other's path. 

00:23:55
PEGGY PAPP I see, I see. 

00:24:00
UNKNONW Or we'll just give up. 

00:24:05
PEGGY PAPP So what do you think happens that, uh, you just keep going like this rather than getting together? 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN What do we think happens? I have no idea why we keep passing paths, but we just keep crossing, you know. We try, we may, we may talk, we communicate a lot, so... 

00:24:20
PEGGY PAPP You do? 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, we do. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, we communicate a lot. We'll sit down and have a little quiet time and talk to each other, I tell my problems and vice versa. Then we'll try to, we'll try to... 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN Well we were raised two different ways too, that has a lot to do with it. 

00:24:35
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, what different ways? 

00:24:35
2-4 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Well I was raised, first of all I was raised by a minister. So my, like, my worries in life, and my goals, and things are more like spiritual and more loving, love your neighbor, you know stuff like that, and more emotional, feeling type life. Which his is, like, more down to earth, um, material, like, you know, if I don't have money, or if I don't have, you know, physical things, you know. And which, I believe, really I do believe, I'm learning, I'm suppose to learn off of him and and he's suppose to learn off of me, but we don't have the way to go about that. 

00:25:20
PEGGY PAPP Uh-huh. Well, tell me a little bit about how you were raised. 

00:25:20
2-5 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Well, basically I was raised to take care of yourself, do what you have to do to survive, you know. If, if you want something go out there and get it, don't wait to talk to somebody else to see, maybe they can help me get it, go out there and get it yourself. That's it, bottom line, you got to do what you have to do to make it. You know, I was raised in a nice home, my mother and father are great individuals, but they taught me to take care of myself. Bottom line, take care of yourself. If you want this done, do it, don't wait for someone. 

00:25:55
PEGGY PAPP So, so you were taught mainly to take action, right? 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN A lot of responsibility. 

00:25:55
PEGGY PAPP Take action, a lot of responsibility, survive, uh-huh. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN 100%. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN Army, he's been to the Army. 

00:26:05
PEGGY PAPP Oh yeah? 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN Oh yes. I was in the Army for 4 years, but I was always told don't sit around and wait, if you sit around and wait you're gonna lose out. So that's why if I feel I want something done, I'll bring it to her, we'll talk about it, if it's not done then I guess that's when attitudes come into play, and that's when we get mad at each other and all of this and that. It's not like I be trying to make her do stuff, it's not like she's trying to make me do things. 

00:26:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, so you're really action oriented and you're more like you say, spiritual and... 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN I was raised, yeah. 

00:26:35
PEGGY PAPP Talk about things and... 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:40
PEGGY PAPP ...talk about feelings. 

00:26:40
2-6 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN I was really raised, like, I was the baby so I had, like, everything thrown at me, you know. So I know, like now, I have a lot of responsibility to learn, I have to get, I know I have to get more responsibility, cuz' I don't really have all that. I mean, I'm responsible, I'm a mother so I'm responsible, I'm not a go getter. I'm not like, that's not one of my good parts of me. 

00:27:05
PEGGY PAPP But you didn't have to be responsible... 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN We talked about this. Like she said, she was, um, she was the youngest so everything was like done for her. She didn't have to worry about doing anything, everything was done. In my situation I had to do it. 

00:27:20
PEGGY PAPP You had to do everything. 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN Everything. 

00:27:20
PEGGY PAPP So how does that work out between you? Do you find that you are doing everything for her and she... 

00:27:25
2-7 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN You know what actually happens, I'm doing my thing, and she's doing hers. I'm still doing what I need to do, you know, like if something needs to be done I'll go ahead and do it, and that's it. If she needs something to be done she'll kinda wait, and wait, and see if I'm gonna go ahead and either do it, or push her to do it or something of that nature, and that's part of the problem cuz' it's burning me out. It's burning me out, you know, I'm trying, and trying on my side and then I'm also trying, and trying to help her as well and, uh, I don't know. 

00:28:00
PEGGY PAPP Well, well, tell me now, uh, how, how did your families respond to your getting together? I mean since your an interracial couple, did either of them have any problems with that. 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN Not a problem, not a problem what so ever. 

00:28:10
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN That was never an issue, that issue, interracial never came up. 

00:28:15
PEGGY PAPP No? 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN No never, never came up, no. 

00:28:20
2-8 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN See I started interracial dating real young, at like 13, 13, 14, and my first relationship was kinda, you know, iffy. They kinda thought it was just a phase and I'd just go through it. But after they got over that and found out that it wasn't a phase, you know, I had some boyfriends before him. So when they did meet him they really liked him for who he was. 

00:28:40
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN You know, they like him a lot. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN I never really had a problem. 

00:28:45
PEGGY PAPP How did you manage to impress them? 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN I have no idea, I was just being myself. To be honest with you I was just being myself. 

00:28:55
PEGGY PAPP They seemed to be very impressed with you. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN I don't know what I did, her mom still tells me, I don't know what you did, but I was just being myself. That's all it was. 

00:29:05
PEGGY PAPP And your family, how did they accept her? 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN 100%. They have no problem with Kayla at all, at all, at all. 

00:29:15
PEGGY PAPP Well gee, that's a real blessing. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Yeah that's good cuz' when you have a family then... 

00:29:15
PEGGY PAPP You don't have to deal with any of that then, that in-law stuff. 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, that makes it hard too, when you're family. 

00:29:20
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. Well, and now, um, how long have you been together? 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Almost 3 years. 

00:29:30
PEGGY PAPP Uh-huh. Do you live together? 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN We've been living together for almost, like, 2, 2 years. 

00:29:35
2-9 

00:29:35
PEGGY PAPP And, and how does it work out, your living together? I mean just the practicalities of it, like, who makes the living, who brings in the money, do you both have jobs? 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Now we do. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Well, see, we both have jobs now, but in the beginning it was also me, it was all me, it was all me. This needed to be done, it was all me. You know, she was always there giving her support but it was all me, every time something came up, it was me, it was me, it was me. 

00:30:00
PEGGY PAPP It was you what? Earning a living. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Earning a living. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN As far, as far as earning a living, paying the bills, taking care of this, taking care of that, making sure we had this, making sure we had everything that we needed. It was all on me, the whole burden was completely on me, and she was there giving her support and all but I don't know if it was... 

00:30:20
PEGGY PAPP You were taking care of her? 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Basically. 

00:30:20
PEGGY PAPP Okay. So then... 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN I had a baby, I got pregnant a year after we were together. 

00:30:25
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN I only worked the first 3 months of my pregnancy, I was off the rest of the time and he took care of me. And then I had the baby and then I got a job like, what, six months after he was born. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Something like that. 

00:30:45
2-10 

00:30:45
PEGGY PAPP And so who took care of the baby? 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN He did. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN There you go. 

00:30:50
PEGGY PAPP You worked and took care of the baby? 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN No, I took care of the baby, oh you mean after I go to work, after I started working? 

00:30:55
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN We switched. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN It just so happened, our jobs, they coincide with each other. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN I go to work and he stays home, yeah, he goes to work and I stay home. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN While I'm at work she's at home with the baby, while she's at home I'm at home with the baby. It just so happens we're lucky at this time, but I know that will change, but. 

00:31:15
PEGGY PAPP Oh, I see. 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN But at first when I wasn't working I took care of the baby but he supported us. 

00:31:20
PEGGY PAPP Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, so it sounds like that's working out well? 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN No. 

00:31:25
PEGGY PAPP No, okay, what's not, what's not good about it 

00:31:25
2-11 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN That part's working out well now because I have a job and I'm bringing in money, and he's bringing in money, it's that, the funds is more mutual now. It's the arguing and the fighting we have a problem, we haven't never fought, neither one of us, really fought, fought, but we have arguments a lot. I don't know if that's our way of communicating when we don't communicate or... 

00:31:50
UNKNOWN See at this point it's built up, it already has built up, you understand what I'm saying? For some reason, like, in the beginning she wasn't working, got a job, lost a job, had the baby, but all that time that she wasn't working and she was just sitting at home with the baby it was steady building up, it was steady building up. As far as me getting upset about little minor things, you know, I go home, work, come home, and it's just a disarray. For some reason I'm not accustomed to that either, I need everything organized, in half way decent order. That would make me somewhat comfortable, you know, it doesn't have to be perfect, nobody's perfect, but in a half way decent order so you can know where this is and you can know where that is, and we had a big problem with that in the beginning. As far as organization... 

00:32:35
PEGGY PAPP all right, so, so what do you think about him wanting order and for you to. 

00:32:40
2-12 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN It's fine, but you know what I've found out in the past, see this is what we'll do; he'll say like, okay, I want this outta you, and he'll say, okay, and I want this outta you. So I'll work really, really hard to make sure the house is clean, real, real nice, make sure dinner is ready for whenever he gets home, you know, and then still work and, you know, give him all these things, but then it's things that I want from him that don't happen, and he, I don't even see him trying. So that's when I'll say... 

00:33:05
PEGGY PAPP Like, what do you want outta him that you don't get? 

00:33:10
UNKNOWN Well, he's, like, not romantic at all. I, like, want, I like a man that shows that he appreciates me, you know, like my birthday will come around and he's not a holiday type person so he doesn't feel like I should get any presents or I shouldn't get no presents at Christmas, or we shouldn't have... 

00:33:30
PEGGY PAPP What do you mean you're not a holiday person, what? 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN What it is, as far as birthdays goes, as far as Christmas I don't make a big deal out of it. Christmas comes around, fine, okay, you wanna give somebody one or two gifts, okay. Okay, your birthday comes around, happy birthday. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, and that's it, or mother's day. 

00:33:45
PEGGY PAPP So when you were growing up you didn't make a big thing about birthdays holidays... 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN No, and I did. 

00:33:50
2-13 

00:33:50
PEGGY PAPP ...so that's not a family tradition for you, and it's a family tradition for you. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:33:55
PEGGY PAPP I see, I see. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Like, Memorial Day, you know, or Labor Day I like to cook, you know, I like to because I feel like when those holidays come around, you know, I kinda, I don't know if I get jealous because everybody else I know is barbequing and everybody else is with their family, and I always. Around holidays all my get together that was like a ritual all the family. 

00:34:15
PEGGY PAPP So you celebrated holidays. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, and we cooked, my mom always cooked, you know, and the family was all together or whatever, or we would go. 

00:34:20
PEGGY PAPP You didn't celebrate the holidays? 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Yes we did. We had family gathering, all our family get together... 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN He didn't like it. 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN ...I only go just because I didn't have a choice, you know. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN To eat. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN I go to eat, enjoy myself... 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, then go to sleep. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN ...I didn't have a choice, you know, I'll go there, if it's Christmas time some of the relatives, throwing a barbeque, having a little Christmas party, fine I'll go over there, laugh and joke for a minute and then I'll go outside and mind my own business. 

00:34:45
2-14 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN They'll all get him something, all of his family will get him something, but he doesn't feel the need to return the favor, you know, he'll show up empty handed when everybody else has all these nice gifts. I'm like, why you don't, why you can't, like if we go to my mom's house, you know, my mom done gone out the way to get him something nice, and I know she's gonna, cuz' she likes him and that's how she is. And I'll tell him, you know, let's go get her something and it's like not no big deal to him. 

00:35:10
PEGGY PAPP So, so, is it something that you would like to change, uh, would you like to, uh, give more gifts, participate more, celebrate, uh. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN I mean, it's not something that I must do it's. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Just like, not having my house in, you know, perfect condition, is something that I don't think is necessary. 

00:35:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, tell me, so you, she said that you weren't very romantic with her, so what's your idea of being romantic? 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Well, I mean her idea of being romantic is coming home with flowers every night... 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Every once in a while. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN ...you know, doing little special stuff like that, bringing her a card every now and then. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Going out to dinner, or candlelight dinner. 

00:35:50
2-15 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN I just don't find a need for that. My thing romantic is that, hey you have everything that you need you don't have to worry about anything, what's the problem, you have everything you need what's the problem. You know, you want me to go out and buy all these roses, you want me to go out and buy all these cards, vases, and whatever, but you have everything you need. 

00:36:05
PEGGY PAPP So, so to you being romantic is having everything you need. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN No, I can't, see you can't break it down like that, but for some, it sounds strange, but. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN It's just like holidays okay. He feels like, why should he get me something for my birthday when he gets me something everyday. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Right. You know, she gets stuff all the time, so her birthday comes around. 

00:36:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, tell me, when you were courting her what did you... 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Nothing. 

00:36:30
PEGGY PAPP ...how were you romantic? 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN She didn't get anything, she didn't receive anything. When we were courting, when we were first started dating. 

00:36:35
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN But that's not why I fell in love with him either. 

00:36:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, how did, excuse me, how did you court her? 

00:36:40
2-16 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Well, you know, we got together, we might have went out here, might to went out to the park, sat around at the park, laughed and joked, at a movie, went over to a friend house, played around at a friend house, played some cards, you know, um, dominoes, or what have you. You know, just basically going out enjoying ourselves with all our other friends. As far as getting all dressed up classy going to a restaurant, or doing all this and that, we never done that when we were courting. 

00:37:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, how did you show her you liked her, affection, warmth, love? 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN She seen it in my eyes I guess, she seen it in my eyes. I didn't have to go inside my pocket to give her anything, I didn't have to go inside the car and give her anything, I didn't have to give her anything she just seen the look on my face. 

00:37:25
PEGGY PAPP So you are romantic through your eyes? 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN I suppose so, but not in her eyes, apparently not. She doesn't think I'm romantic at all. 

00:37:30
PEGGY PAPP So, so, well, did he have romantic eyes? Did you feel. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN No, that's not really why I fell in love with him. Um. 

00:37:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, in what way was he romantic... 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN In the beginning. 

00:37:40
PEGGY PAPP ... that made you fall in love with him? There has to be something right? 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN He really wasn't, that's what I'm saying, that's why I didn't... 

00:37:50
PEGGY PAPP Really? Oh, I see, I see, okay. 

00:37:50
2-17 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN I liked him because, well, we had things in common, and, you know, he just he was a nice guy, you know. It was like I knew that he wasn't gonna, you know, fake me, like say, I'm coming, and not come. I knew that he was gonna, that, that he's just a nice guy, you know, all around. 

00:38:10
PEGGY PAPP He was dependable. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, he's dependable, he was a nice guy. 

00:38:15
PEGGY PAPP He could keep his word. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN He's just a nice guy, you know, he's not someone who's gonna treat you like, really, really wrong, you know. 

00:38:20
PEGGY PAPP He's gonna be responsible to you, dependable, you could count on him, and. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, and then the part where we say going around visiting friends and stuff, that was fine because I didn't know none of his friends at first, so going around them it was fine, but now that's like all we do, and the same old people, and I'm tired of seeing the same old people. 

00:38:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, what about your friends, do you go around visiting your friends? 

00:38:45
2-18 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN I don't really have no friends cuz', I don't know, I just lost a lot of my high school friends. I only have a couple good friends that, you know, that I have and they've all made families. You know, my one good friend got married, my other good friend that I had she got on drugs, and she, I can't hang around with that so she left, you know, we don't hang around no more. And, like, that's basically it my other good friend they haven't got married, but they got two kids and one on the way, so all my friends are like families now, you know, they're all at home. 

00:39:15
PEGGY PAPP What's wrong with visiting families? 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Nothing. It's fine, it's just, every time we go out I don't wanna keep doing the same thing. You know? 

00:39:25
PEGGY PAPP Do you like to visit her friends? 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN I have no problem with it what so ever, all her friends' are. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN My friends are his friends and his friends are my friends. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN I have no problem with it at all. 

00:39:35
PEGGY PAPP What about families, do you visit each other's families? 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, we go to each other's families. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, we go to each other's families quite a bit, all the time. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN It's just, I'm so bored with that. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN That's not a problem. It's like she just gets tired of the same old routine, which I can understand that, everybody does. 

00:39:45
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, you can understand that? 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, everybody does, everybody gets tired of the same old stuff. 

00:39:50
PEGGY PAPP What is it you understand about that? 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN What do I understand about that? 

00:39:50
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, that she gets tired of the same routine. 

00:39:50
2-19 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN I mean, I get tired of the same old stuff, I mean, to be honest I get tired of going to work everyday cuz' sometimes I want a day off, you know. I get tired of jumping in the car, some days I want somebody to drive me to work, I get tired of the same old stuff. 

00:40:00
PEGGY PAPP So, so, how do you try to get out of this regular, same old, routine? Do you every do anything, do you ever surprise her with anything different? 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN I mean, not really, maybe every now and then I might do something, but it's. 

00:40:15
PEGGY PAPP Like what, like what? 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN I don't know, like I know she's a sweet fanatic, she loves sweets so the other day she was at work I came home, I bought her, um, ... 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, a little cake. 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN ...a cake. 

00:40:25
PEGGY PAPP Oh, was that romantic? 

00:40:25
UNKNOWN Oh, no not to her should have been a bucket of flowers, a dozen. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, no, I don't look at it like that see, I looked at it like, oh my gosh he actually went out of his way. 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN See, every time I do something. 

00:40:35
PEGGY PAPP But, isn't that what you would call romantic? 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, exactly. That's what I want from him just sometimes to go out of your way. 

00:40:45
PEGGY PAPP So that meant a lot to you? The fact that he would just go out of his way to do that, that he thought about you. 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's basically it. I just want sometimes, for him to think about me, and, you know, do something. 

00:40:55
2-20 

00:40:55
PEGGY PAPP Gee, how did you happen to do that, how did you all of a sudden think about her and buy that for her? Seems very special. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN It was probably on sale. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN No, me and my son. 

00:41:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, if it tasted good. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN My son and I were in the store and we were getting something eat and I seen the cake sitting there, so I said let's get mommy a cake, and he agreed to it of course so, that's why I got it. 

00:41:15
PEGGY PAPP I see. So it was just an idea that came to you? 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Just popped up. 

00:41:20
PEGGY PAPP Oh, I see. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN Right then I just looked and seen the cake, and I know that she likes sweets so, why not? 

00:41:25
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, so, um, did she seem to appreciate it? 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, now I mean, did you seem to. 

00:41:35
UNKOWN Well, I mean, I guess she did because... 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN He left right away though. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN ...what happened was I brought the cake in, set the cake down, picked her up from work, came home, and then I went to sleep. Because I work midnights so I really didn't see her face reaction, I didn't see how she reacted about buying the cake. She told me, oh you bought me a cake thank you, and that was it. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN But I really appreciated it. 

00:41:55
PEGGY PAPP Well, did that make you feel good that she appreciated it? 

00:41:55
2-21 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN I mean, yeah it made me feel good, I didn't feel bad afterwards, okay she liked the cake. 

00:42:00
PEGGY PAPP Okay, okay. No I was just wondering, since it was a good experience for both of you if it would be an experience that you would want to have more often. You know, it also sounds like you can produce it. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can, I mean. 

00:42:15
PEGGY PAPP You can produce that kind of reaction in her. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN I can. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Another thing though, see that's probably why, cuz' see he knows how to get to me, he knows, like, if he don't do this then I'm gonna be mad. So his way about going about things if he's in any kind of bad mood or anything, or he's mad at me or anything, then that's what he does. He does the first thing that can get on my nerves, so that would be don't bring her nothing at all, but if he is in a good mood and I've done something good, or whatever, then it's like a treat. 

00:42:50
PEGGY PAPP So what do you have to do good that makes him be in a good mood? 

00:42:55
2-22 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN I don't know, he goes through mood swings, he does. Well, we'll talk about mood swings but he does too. 

00:43:00
PEGGY PAPP Now, now tell me what does she do that makes you feel good? That puts you in a good mood? 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Well, actually when she's around the house and she's just happy, and she's not always, excuse my expression, but bitching all the time, you know, if she's not doing all that then I'm fine. 

00:43:20
PEGGY PAPP You mean, as long as she's not complaining about something. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Right, you know, about small stuff, you know, oh I want to go somewhere, oh I wanna do this, I wanna do that. I'm like, man come on you know I gotta go to work in a couple of hours, how we plan on doing all this stuff before I go to work and me still being able to work after all of this, she doesn't look at it like that. 

00:43:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, what would you rather have her do? What would make you feel good? 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN I mean, just stop complaining, you know, stop complaining. 

00:43:40
PEGGY PAPP Is that all? 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN I mean. 

00:43:45
PEGGY PAPP Not do anything beside that? 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Well, I mean, she walks around the house happy, she doesn't walk around the house moping all the time, and that's a good thing. Cuz' if she did that all the time then I'd be outside the house all the time, but she doesn't walk around moping that much, but. 

00:44:00
PEGGY PAPP So generally she has a happy disposition? 

00:44:00
2-23 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Right, she's pretty much, and more so now that the baby is around. The baby is 10 months now so if she does get in a down mood she'll look at the baby, get to playing with the baby, then her spirits will get lifted, then she'll bring the baby in there with me and my spirits will get lifted, and vice versa, you know. But before the baby. 

00:44:15
PEGGY PAPP So the baby lifts both of your spirits. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, he does, he does a whole lot. But before the baby came around, she would be moping and she would just sit there and just mope, you know. I'd be like, what's wrong, what do you wanna do, well, I wanna do something different, okay what do you wanna do, I don't know. 

00:44:30
PEGGY PAPP But, now that the baby's born, and the baby lifts both of your spirits, and, uh, she's less that way, so what else do you like her to do that makes you feel good, puts you in a good mood? Do you like her to be affectionate with you, or to bring you any, like, cakes, or. 

00:44:50
2-23 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN You know what, for her to just gain responsibility on her own that'd make me extremely happy right there. Stop depending on me all the time, she depends on me a whole lot, a whole lot. 

00:45:00
PEGGY PAPP Uh huh, in what way do you want her to take more responsibility, to do what? 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Just do things, you know, for herself so to speak, you know. If she needs something done don't wait for me to keep pushing you or pushing, just go on, do what you have to do. You know, we may go grocery shopping, I end up carrying out fine and dandy, if I'm at work, she goes grocery shopping, she'll wait for me to get off work to carry the groceries up. Before she's gonna walk up three flights of stairs. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Well, wait a minute. Are you gonna say that I am trying, cuz' now what did I do the last time I went grocery shopping? 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean yea you are trying. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN I carried a 10 month old up the stairs and I made 5 trips up and down three flights of stairs to bring the groceries up, all the bags upstairs. 

00:45:40
PEGGY PAPP So you say you're trying. 

00:45:40
UNKOWN Yeah, I can see myself trying, but I don't see him trying. 

00:45:45
PEGGY PAPP So you feel you are trying what, what to be more responsible, I think. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. To not depend on him that's what he does not want me to do. 

00:45:55
PEGGY PAPP To not depend on him so much. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:55
2-25 

00:45:55
PEGGY PAPP What are some of the other ways that you don't depend on, that you're trying not to depend on him so much? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN It's a lot of other things that she do for me, like tidiness, you know, cuz' at one point when we first got together she was take them off, leave them, you know, take clothes off, leave them. If you eat in the living room or something, leave it, you know, she'd eat in the bedroom, she would leave it. You know, right now she's starting to get a little more tidier, but I don't look at it like. 

00:46:25
PEGGY PAPP She's really... 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Trying. 

00:46:30
PEGGY PAPP Sounds like she's trying a lot. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Right, but I feel like it's not for me, she's not doing all that tidying. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Yes, really I am. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN But, it's a part of life you have to do it yourself you can't just go around leaving this here, leaving that there. 

00:46:40
PEGGY PAPP You don't appreciate the fact she's doing it just for you? 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN I mean, I don't like to look at it like she's doing it for me. Cuz' it's not strictly for me it's something she has, if I die today, she have, you can't just leave your stuff there, you can't, you know. 

00:46:55
2-26 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN No, but I wouldn't pick it up as soon as I finish eating it. I might leave it there until I get ready to go towards the kitchen, not hurry up and bring it right then and there. 

00:47:05
PEGGY PAPP Listen, you're being a very positive influence on her. Yeah? I mean you should take credit for that, I mean, you know, you're, she's saying I'm doing this for you so, some of it she says she's doing it for herself because she wants to do better. Some of it she's doing to please you, so it sounds like you're having a very positive influence. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Right, but see then you're breaking it down she's doing it for me, that's what I don't like. I don't like to hear she's doing it for me cuz' it's a part of life itself, it has nothing to do with me. If I wasn't here at all you still have to do that. 

00:47:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, what do you think she does do that has to do with you? 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN I mean, uh, that's a broad question, I don't understand how can I. 

00:47:45
PEGGY PAPP Well, do you think she does anything that has to do with you? 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Well, I mean, everything she does should be for herself first, and then for me. You know, she shouldn't just do stuff just to please me, it should be for her. Once she's pleased herself, then go ahead and try to make me happy. When she's done for herself, then come over here and try to make me happy. 

00:48:05
2-27 

00:48:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, now how can she make you happy? 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN I don't know how to answer that. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN I know, he wants me to stop complaining, he wants me to go to school, and he wants me to get a get a good job, and he wants me, he wants me to have a lot of money, everything that's physical. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN But, she gives up. 

00:48:25
PEGGY PAPP And you want him to want you for what, something that's not physical, but what? 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Emotional. 

00:48:35
PEGGY PAPP Uh-huh, which would mean what to you, if he were emotional with you what would it be like. 

00:48:40
2-28 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN I want, I want, really I want him to sit, to step back and think about what are the important things in life, and stop worrying about all this other stuff that's not, you know. You know what I wish I could do to him? I wish that I could tell him? I wish that I could tell him to ask himself, what would get him into heaven, and that's it. Leave it at that, because if he would treat me... 

00:49:05
PEGGY PAPP What an interesting question. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN ...yeah, if he would treat me like, like, um, an angel. 

00:49:15
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN And, like, if I treated him like an angel, if we both did that and we worried about what God would want from us, and not what other people in life want from us, that would be the relationship that I want. 

00:49:25
PEGGY PAPP Well, what would it be like if you were each treating each other as an angel? What would it be like if he treated you as an angel? 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN Well it would be, like, he would be concerned about how I felt, he would be concerned about, um, like, seeing a smile on my face, you know, and never, if, if I was treating him like an angel then I would never treat him wrong because that would be a sin. You know, I'm trying for a non-sinful life, it's hard because everybody has sin, but that's my goal in life. 

00:50:00
PEGGY PAPP Okay, so he would treat you like, care about your feelings. 

00:50:05
2-29 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, everything emotional. 

00:50:05
PEGGY PAPP (crosstalk) If he treated you like an angel he'd care about your feelings, and how you're feeling, and if you're treating him like an angel though, exactly what would it look like? What would you be doing, what? 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Um, just enjoying life, you know life is short. 

00:50:20
PEGGY PAPP You'd enjoy him? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Enjoy him, enjoy our life, enjoy our son, you know, just be happy, you know. That's all I really want. I mean, I know, you have to have, you can't just say, I want my life based on this cuz' you have to eat, you know, I understand that, but not be so worried about it, you know. I don't wanna be ill at a young age cuz' I'm so worried about whether or not I'm gonna be rich in the future. 

00:50:45
PEGGY PAPP Yes. So you'd like him to stop worrying a bit. So how does that sound to you? Her idea of heaven and the way you would treat each other as angels. 

00:50:55
UNKNOWN Well, I can understand, I can understand us treating each other like angels, okay. 

00:50:55
PEGGY PAPP Yeah? What can you understand she wants when she says she wants you to understand her emotionally, what do you understand by that? 

00:51:05
2-30 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Okay, what I get from that is, all right, like, sometimes she may say, okay I feel a little sick. I'll say okay fine, she'll say her stomach hurts, all right ain't no need to sit there crying about it. Your stomach hurt, you just gotta deal with it, what can I do about your stomach, to make your stomach feel better? She wants me to sit there and cuddle her and hold her. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN No, no. 

00:51:25
PEGGY PAPP She wants you to be sympathetic. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN She wants me to be, exactly. She claims I'm heartless because if she gets sick, I'm like okay, deal with it. Then If I get sick I just deal with it. 

00:51:35
PEGGY PAPP But when you understand that she wants you to be sympathetic, is that something you can be? Can you be sympathetic? 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can be sympathetic, but. 

00:51:45
PEGGY PAPP If you were to be sympathetic what would you be like? What would you do? 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN I mean, I'd be loving, I'd tell her, aww, you know, I might rub her little tummy or something like that, you know, do all that good stuff. 

00:51:50
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, really? You're able to do that? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can do that, but I'd just be doing it because I know. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Doing it for me. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:52:00
PEGGY PAPP Well, that's not a bad thing to do it for her, is it? 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN It's, it's not a bad thing, sure, no, but, still I don't see, just because you're sick you just gotta deal with it. 

00:52:10
2-31 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN And that's it, that's the whole problem right there. He wants me to do everything he says, but if I say, be sympathetic, be romantic, be this, be that, be this, whatever, he don't feel like he should have to do it. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN I don't feel like I shouldn't have to do it at all. 

00:52:25
PEGGY PAPP But you do, do it sometimes it sounds like, don't you? 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, sometimes. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN And that's not it, see he. 

00:52:30
PEGGY PAPP Huh, yeah? 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'll do it sometimes. Sometimes I may do this and I may do that for her but. 

00:52:35
PEGGY PAPP And why do you do it, when you do it? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Why? 

00:52:35
PEGGY PAPP Why? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Just because it popped in my head to do something like that, so go ahead and do it. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN He was in a good mood. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Maybe, that might be why, I don't know. 

00:52:45
PEGGY PAPP Maybe because she likes it, do you ever do it because she likes it? 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Well, yeah I know she likes it, that's the way she told you. That's the way sometimes I get back at her, I don't do stuff. There's a lot of times I will not do stuff. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Isn't that what I said? 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN You know, like if I'm aggravated or something. 

00:52:55
PEGGY PAPP So what effect does that have on her? 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN A big one. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN It drives her crazy. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Cuz' then I'm like, well I don't wanna do nothing for you then, that's my first line outta my mouth, if you don't wanna do nothing for me then I don't wanna do nothing for you. 

00:53:05
PEGGY PAPP I see. So you don't, you don't get any mileage outta that, right? 

00:53:10
2-32 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:53:10
PEGGY PAPP Cuz' then she doesn't do anything for you. Sounds like that doesn't work to well. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Just brings us down, back down. If we get up he'll do something and I'll say well fine then, and we'll just be right back down again. 

00:53:25
PEGGY PAPP You know, since you seem like a, a very adventurous couple, willing to try different things, uh, there's an exercise I do that I have found helpful in, uh, understanding how people experience a relationship, how each of you experience it in a different way. You've told me something about that, but, uh, this is kind of a fun, playful, imaginative, exercise and I was wondering would you be willing to try it? 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN If it's not beating each other with a Styrofoam bat, then okay. 

00:54:00
2-32 

00:54:00
PEGGY PAPP No, it's not doing that. You don't have to touch each other. Okay. Now it's just, uh, it's kinda fun and imaginative, and, and sometimes it's helpful. You know, because it gives you different images and different ways of communicating. Okay. Well, let's try it. Are you willing? 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:54:20
2-33 

00:54:20
2-34 

00:54:20
2-35 

00:54:20
PEGGY PAPP all right, now I want you to just sit back and get very comfortable in your chairs, and close your eyes, take a deep breath, let out all the tension in your body, now think about the problem that you're having, and think about all the feelings that are stirred up inside of you when you can't solve that problem. When it's frustrating, you know, when you get into this thing you were telling me that you knock heads, and you go in different directions, and you know, can't get it together, just think about that for a minute. The feelings it stirs up. Now if you were to have a dream or a fantasy, in which you were having this problem, what symbolic forms would each of you appear in, in the fantasy or dream? And by symbolic I mean, you know what it's like sometimes in dreams, you don't see people in their real forms, they take on different images, like, I don't know, somebody out of a fairy tale or, uh, out of a historical novel, or, uh, even an animal, or, you know, how in dreams people take on different shapes and forms. So what symbolic form would you see the other person in and what symbolic form would you take when you're trying to solve this problem that you can't solve? Think about it for a minute, wait don't talk. And then how would you move towards or away from each other, I mean, what would the dance be between you as you're trying to solve this, this problem between these two symbolic forms? How would they relate to each other? And imagine where it would take place, would it be in a cave, a castle, on the beach, and I don't know, wherever it would take place. And then when you've thought of it I'd like you to just open your eyes, but don't talk. Okay? all right. Now I'm gonna ask you to do something that you may think is a little crazy. But you have to trust me. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:56:45
PEGGY PAPP That it might be helpful. Okay, I'd like you to stand up, push your chairs back. Okay. I think, now we're gonna stay within this light area. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:55
PEGGY PAPP I think you opened your eyes first so, what did you imagine you were and what was she in relation to you? 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN She was bird. 

00:57:05
PEGGY PAPP She's a bird. What kind of a bird? 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Just a nice pretty little bird flying around. 

00:57:10
PEGGY PAPP Pretty little bird? 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:57:10
PEGGY PAPP What color? 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN I never thought about that, that wasn't in my picture at all. 

00:57:10
PEGGY PAPP Okay. 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN Just a bird. 

00:57:15
2-36 

00:57:15
PEGGY PAPP She's a pretty little bird. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:57:15
PEGGY PAPP Okay. And what were you? 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN I was a cat. 

00:57:15
PEGGY PAPP You were a cat. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Yes, I was a cat. 

00:57:20
PEGGY PAPP Okay, okay. And, uh, so what is, what's the movement between the cat and the bird? What's the problem between them? 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN What it is, myself I'm down as the cat and I'm looking up and I see the bird constantly flying around. Just in a care free world, just floating around, nice and, just, extremely happy, floating around. And I'm down at the bottom being the cat, trying to make it, so to speak. You know, I'm still happy and I'm still doing what I need to do, but I'm just down to earth. 

00:57:50
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Now, I'm gonna ask you to do something. I told you, you may think I'm crazy but, I'd like you to act this out. You pretend you're the cat, okay, get down on your hands and knees. 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Mine's gonna be good then. 

00:58:00
PEGGY PAPP You're a little bird, would you fly around? 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN Okay, and, and what's the problem for the cat in having the little bird just fly around? 

00:58:15
2-37 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Well, it's not the bird that's flying around in the barn. The bird is constantly flying around inside the barn that the cat lives in. I live in the barn and I see she keeps disturbing my barn, and knocking stuff over when she gets to flying. Yeah, that's exactly what happens she's just flying around, messing with me, just keep doing everything. So I'm gonna start creeping around. 

00:58:35
PEGGY PAPP So, so what does the cat do? 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN At this point I'm just trying to sneak around trying to sneak up on the bird. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Eats him, eats me. 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Teach the bird a lesson to stay outta my barn. 

00:58:45
PEGGY PAPP Well, how you gonna teach the bird a lesson? 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN I'm gonna try to grab the bird, sneak around the bird. 

00:58:50
UNKNOWN You can't catch me cuz' I can fly and you can't. 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN I'm gonna go around, try to find the bird. 

00:58:55
PEGGY PAPP Okay, you're gonna grab the bird, then what would you do with the bird after you grabbed it? 

00:59:00
UNKOWN Just scare the bird, I'm not gonna eat the bird, I got plenty of food down here. 

00:59:05
PEGGY PAPP You're not gonna eat the bird, you're just gonna scare the bird? 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Just gonna scare the bird, teach him to stay outta my barn. 

00:59:10
PEGGY PAPP Scare the bird, okay. Let's see, so you grab the bird. And does that scare the bird? 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN I'm flying you can't grab me. 

00:59:15
PEGGY PAPP Does that work? 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN She stops flying though, that's a fear for a bird not to be able to fly. 

00:59:15
2-38 

00:59:15
PEGGY PAPP I see. I see. But then again the cat can't hold onto the bird forever right? So as soon as you let go of it, the bird flies again? 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Basically. 

00:59:25
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Then I'll keep tapping her again. 

00:59:30
PEGGY PAPP I see, I see. So that just kind of goes on and on, you grab the bird, she's scared, but you can't hold onto her and do your work so she flies again. 

00:59:35
UNKNOWN But see, I'm a smart bird, I'm a smart bird, and he's a dumb cat. He's on the ground, I'm flying, he can't catch me. Cuz' I'm not gonna stop with a cap in the barn. 

00:59:45
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN I'm gonna fly out of the barn, and you're gonna be stuck in the barn. 

00:59:50
PEGGY PAPP Okay, good, but now I'd like you to share, what would be the ideal fantasy you would have between a cat and a bird? How would you, show me, if the cat and the bird were... 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN Me, riding on his back. 

01:00:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, wait, wait, this is his fantasy. 

01:00:05
UNKNOWN My ideal fantasy for a cat and a bird, I don't, I don't see an ideal fantasy for a cat and a bird. 

01:00:10
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. Right. 

01:00:10
UNKNOWN I can't picture something like that, a fantasy for a cat and a bird, you know, cuz' they like don't get along. A cat and a bird aren't the best of friends. 

01:00:20
2-39 

01:00:20
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, that's true. So, I guess, one of the images would have to change, like. 

01:00:25
UNKNOWN That's possible, but it's my image. 

01:00:30
PEGGY PAPP It's your image? 

01:00:30
UNKNOWN I'm a cat. 

01:00:30
PEGGY PAPP So you're not going to change as the cat. What do you want, do you want to change her into another cat? 

01:00:40
UNKNOWN No, she can't be a cat with me, cuz' she might win. She can't be a cat with me, no. I like her up high where I can keep a nice little eye on her and I can creep up on her and she can't spot me everywhere I go. 

01:00:50
PEGGY PAPP I see, because if she were another cat she'd be on an equal level with you. Right, is that it? 

01:00:55
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

01:00:55
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

01:01:00
PEGGY PAPP So you feel you have the advantage now, of her being able to reach up and scare the cat? 

01:01:05
UNKNOWN Exactly, me being the cat. 

01:01:05
PEGGY PAPP I see, I see. Okay. all right. Well, now what's your worst nightmare about this, what if this never changed? Just went on forever. What would you do? 

01:01:15
UNKOWN Worst nightmare is someone close the barn doors and you're trapped in their together. 

01:01:20
2-40 

01:01:20
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. 

01:01:20
UNKNOWN Then she's just constantly disarraying the whole barn, messing it all up, then it'll be like that till someone releases her again. 

01:01:30
PEGGY PAPP It'll be like that forever. 

01:01:30
UNKNOWN Right. That's the biggest fear. 

01:01:35
PEGGY PAPP Okay. all right. Let's see, now you can stand up, okay. 

01:01:35
UNKNOWN Mine's sort of the same thing because we're two different. 

01:01:40
PEGGY PAPP No, what was your fantasy? 

01:01:40
UNKNOWN Mine was he was (inaudible ) half man, half horse, Pegasus. 

01:01:45
PEGGY PAPP He's half man and half horse? 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN Pegasus? 

01:01:50
PEGGY PAPP Oh, uh, Saturn? Is that it? 

01:01:50
UNKNOWN No, Pegasus. 

01:01:55
PEGGY PAPP Oh, Pegasus. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN Isn't that what it's called? 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN On the horse's body? 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN Half man, half horse body. 

01:02:00
PEGGY PAPP What do they call that. 

01:02:00
UNKOWN A Pegasus, I think. 

01:02:00
PEGGY PAPP A Pegasus. 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN I think. 

01:02:05
PEGGY PAPP I think so. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN Well, that's what it is. 

01:02:05
PEGGY PAPP Cuz' a Saturn is something different, okay. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN But, he's one of those and I'm one of those, but I'm a unicorn Pegasus. 

01:02:10
PEGGY PAPP You're a unicorn? Okay. 

01:02:10
UNKOWN And I can fly. 

01:02:15
PEGGY PAPP And you can fly? So he was flying. 

01:02:15
UNKOWN And he was stomping to get a fly off his tail, and I was flying. 

01:02:25
2-41 

01:02:25
PEGGY PAPP So you are a fly, is that what you are, you are a what? 

01:02:30
UNKOWN No. I'm a unicorn Pegasus. 

01:02:35
PEGGY PAPP You are a unicorn that can fly. Okay. all right. Well, tell him what to do. Let's see, how would you get him to help. 

01:02:40
UNKNOWN Basically all I do is stand there. 

01:02:40
UNKNOWN Stomp, go back on the ground like you was, and I'm flying again. 

01:02:45
PEGGY PAPP Okay. And what is the problem then with the unicorn and the Pegasus? 

01:02:50
UNKNOWN He's just standing there he ain't doing nothing, he's just stomping looking silly. 

01:02:55
PEGGY PAPP What do you want him to do, what does the, uh, unicorn flying unicorn want him to do? 

01:03:05
UNKNOWN I can't fly. 

01:03:05
UNKNOWN Get smart, run away from the fly. 

01:03:10
PEGGY PAPP You want him to run away? 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN From the fly. 

01:03:10
PEGGY PAPP Oh. 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN See the fly was bothering me that's why I was stomping, cuz' the fly was bothering me, cuz' I was just sitting there, and she said she's flying around. 

01:03:20
UNKOWN Just watching him. 

01:03:20
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN And she's watching me with this aggravating fly messing with me and I'm trying to get it off. 

01:03:25
2-42 

01:03:25
PEGGY PAPP Okay. 

01:03:25
UNKNOWN So you just want me to just take off running, right? 

01:03:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:03:30
PEGGY PAPP So the fly is what, all the problems that he has? 

01:03:30
UNKOWN Yeah, and he's just standing there and not doing nothing about the fly. 

01:03:35
PEGGY PAPP And, he's just stomping on the fly. And then what effect does that have on the fly and unicorn, what does the fly and unicorn want from him? 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN To get away from the fly because. 

01:03:50
PEGGY PAPP And do what? 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN And go in the pasture. 

01:03:50
PEGGY PAPP Okay, let's see. If you got away from the flies, stopped, you know, stomping. Let's see, you get up. Okay. and the two of you, stand right here, so the two of you go in the pasture. What do you do in the pasture? 

01:04:05
UNKNOWN We're fine. 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN Keep the flies away from us or something? 

01:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, keep the flies, cuz' you got away from the one, and now we don't have that problem no more, and now you're over here by me and I'll keep them away. 

01:04:20
PEGGY PAPP Let's see, go over there by her. Oh, I see so you're going to keep the fly away. 

01:04:25
2-43 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Since I don't have wings, you know. 

01:04:30
PEGGY PAPP I see. So you're saying if he only got up, stopped being so preoccupied with that fly on the ground. 

01:04:35
UNKNOWN No, not doing that, just not doing nothing at all, he's just standing there, stomping and that ain't doing nothing. 

01:04:45
PEGGY PAPP That you would be able to help him. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:04:45
PEGGY PAPP Yes. Right. If only he would go with you, I see, I see. Well, let's sit down and talk about this for a minute, okay. So, what was that experience like? Were either of you surprised with the other person's fantasy or with your own? 

01:05:00
2-44 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN I kinda knew his because his goes deeper, because, see he's in our relationship I'm the one that's kind of more like, babe I know that we love each other, and I'm the one that's saying we gotta do something about it. We have to fix our problem, or we're not gonna make it. He is, I guess, he's so he's got a lot of pain coming from somewhere, I don't know, but, I don't know if it's me or past or what, but he's at that point, like, you know, maybe it is nothing for us. You know, maybe we should break up and not have nothing to do with each other. 

01:05:40
PEGGY PAPP Oh, is that the point where you're at? 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN Basically, I told her that already though. We spoke about that a while back, you know, you just get fed up with something so much, what're you suppose to do? Keep dealing with it, and keep being miserable, keep being unhappy, or break it off so maybe you can try something else. You may be unhappy after you break it off, but who knows, it's just a chance you have to take. 

01:06:00
PEGGY PAPP But, you're saying that if you work on it... 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN Get help. 

01:06:05
PEGGY PAPP ...get help and work on it something different could happen. 

01:06:10
UNKNOWN And I always tell him, what's worse an alcoholic that doesn't, you know, say that he's an, admit to being, okay look an alcoholic that admits he's an alcoholic and goes to AA is better than an alcoholic that says, I'm not an alcoholic. Because he doesn't, he's not admitting to his problems, he's not admitting that he's sick and needs help. 

01:06:30
2-45 

01:06:30
PEGGY PAPP Uh, well, so you're telling me that sometimes you get very, you get frustrated about whether or not you can change this kind of cycle or interaction between the two of you, where you go like this right? 

01:06:45
UNKNOWN Right. Well, I feel I probably wouldn't be so upset if that independence came into play. If she was, like, independent and doing, it all wouldn't be on me. 

01:06:55
PEGGY PAPP Okay, okay. 

01:06:55
UNKNOWN With everything on me that just weighs me down so much, and I get so aggravated, and just tired, and, when does it stop? 

01:07:00
2-46 

01:07:00
PEGGY PAPP Okay, okay. Well, listen you know what I'd like to do now, cuz' I need to think a minute about your fantasies. They were very rich and very imaginative, so I'd like to take a break for just a few minutes, and then I will come back, and I think they're going to turn off the take while I'm gone so you can just talk between yourselves for a few minutes. 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Okay, all right. 

01:07:25
PEGGY PAPP Okay. 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN Can we like, turn on another light so these. 

01:07:30
[sil.] 

01:07:35
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Well, listen I was really impressed with your fantasies and, uh, I went out and thought about them for a few minutes and, uh, the thing that struck me was that you both saw her as a bird. 

01:07:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:07:50
PEGGY PAPP And, uh, you both saw him on the ground somehow, I mean, very, uh, uh, connected with the ground. 

01:08:00
UNKNOWN Down to earth. 

01:08:05
PEGGY PAPP And, um, since you have both said that, uh, you would like to change this pattern of missing each other we were thinking that, um, in order for you not to feel so responsible, and so burdened, so you know, weighted down with everything. What you would need to do would be to fly every now and then to learn to. 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, but when I flew and came back then I'm gonna have to straighten up everything when I come back, cuz' it'll be all disarrayed. 

01:08:40
2-47 

01:08:40
2-48 

01:08:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, not necessarily, you could learn to fly just a little bit and just kind of soar a little bit, and, uh, so it would be kind of nice. The thing that I was thinking that, uh, you would need to do in order to be more responsible, which you say, would be to yeah, come down to each more, and to be by his side. And, um, I was also thinking that, you know, if you are able to get black and white together as beautifully as you've done and your families together, that you certainly are capable of getting a cat and a bird together. And, uh, you know, there's some children's stories where cats and birds do get together, and cats and birds don't necessarily have to be enemies all the time. But I was thinking that, wow, you know, you've, you certainly came from different backgrounds and, uh, different traditions, and here you are, you're able to come together, uh, in this way in which, uh, in which this racial issue doesn't even create a problem for you, and that's a really big one. You got your families together, that doesn't create a problem, and, uh, uh, it's my feeling anyway, that, uh, you certainly are capable of getting, uh, uh, the bird, and the Pegasus, or the cat. 

01:10:15
2-49 

01:10:20
UNKOWN We both knew that we were capable it's just, it's putting all the pieces together to make the complete puzzles so that it can be complete. But we both, you know, I know I'm capable of changing and doing new things. 

01:10:30
PEGGY PAPP You do, you do, yeah? 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN Yes, I do. 

01:10:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, since you know you're capable of it, what would be a first step just to begin to do that? 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN Just be more caring. 

01:10:40
PEGGY PAPP More caring? 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN More caring. Right, because at this point. 

01:10:45
PEGGY PAPP And you're convinced you're capable of doing that? 

01:10:45
UNKNOWN Absolutely I'm capable of doing that, yes. 

01:10:50
PEGGY PAPP Well, I believe you, I believe you. You say that with such conviction, I do believe you. 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN He's one of those who knows he can do just about anything. 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN Right, you know. 

01:10:55
PEGGY PAPP Really? 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN If I wanna do something I'm gonna do it. 

01:11:00
PEGGY PAPP You do strike be as a person that can do anything he makes up his mind to do. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN He do jump out of planes. Anybody who can jump out of a plane can do just about anything. 

01:11:05
PEGGY PAPP So, you're gonna decide to be a more caring, is that right? 

01:11:10
UNKNOWN Well, we can make a step, I can try a step, you know, take it a little bit at a time. I try a step, but then I know soon as. 

01:11:15
PEGGY PAPP I'm sure you'll be able to do that. And you? 

01:11:20
UNKOWN Go back to trying again. 

01:11:25
PEGGY PAPP Are you, are you as convinced as he is, that once you make up your mind to do something you can do it, you can change it? 

01:11:30
2-50 

01:11:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:30
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Well, I'm convinced you can do it too. 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:35
PEGGY PAPP Okay? 

01:11:35
UNKNOWN We'll see what happens. 

01:11:40
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Well listen, now another, you know, counselor is going to be assigned to you. 

01:11:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:11:45
PEGGY PAPP Will be seeing you and she will be able to watch this video tape, and, uh, see what happened. And you'll be able to discuss it with her, or him, whoever it is. And I just wanted to say it's been a real pleasure working with you. 

01:11:55
UNKNOWN Likewise, likewise. 

01:12:00
PEGGY PAPP It's been a lot of fun and, uh, very satisfying. 

01:12:05
UNKNOWN Thank you whole bunches for listening. Thank you. 

01:12:10
PEGGY PAPP And the best of luck. 

01:12:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:12:10
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Now I don't know how you get out, but, uh. 

01:12:15
UNKNOWN Fly away, let's fly. 

01:12:20
UNKNOWN Run away. 

01:12:20
3-1 

01:12:25
JON CARLSON Let's take now to carefully look at selected segments from this interview. Let's begin by looking at piece that came pretty early in the interview, where he talks about themes in his life. Themes of survival and themes of responsibility. 

01:12:45
PEGGY PAPP Okay. 

01:12:45
UNKNOWN Do what you have to do to survive, you know. If, if you want something go out there and get it, don't wait to talk to somebody else to see, maybe they can help me get it, go out there and get it yourself. That's it, bottom line, you gotta do what you have to do to make it. You know, I was raised in a nice home, my mother and father are great individuals, but they taught me to take care of myself. Bottom line, take care of yourself. If you want this done, do it, don't wait for someone. 

01:13:15
PEGGY PAPP So, so you were taught mainly to take action, right? 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

01:13:15
UNKNOWN A lot of responsibility. 

01:13:15
3-2 

01:13:20
PEGGY PAPP Take action, a lot of responsibility, survive, uh-huh. 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN 100%. 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN Army, he's been to the Army. 

01:13:25
PEGGY PAPP Oh yeah? 

01:13:25
UNKNOWN Oh yes. I was in the Army for 4 years, but I was always told don't sit around and wait, if you sit around and wait you're gonna lose out. So that's why if I feel I want something done, I'll bring it to her, we'll talk about it, if it's not done then I guess that's when attitudes come into play, and that's when we get mad at each other and all of this and that. It's not like I be trying to make her do stuff, it's not like she's trying to make me do things. 

01:13:50
PEGGY PAPP Well, so you're really action oriented and you're more like you say, spiritual and... 

01:13:55
UNKNOWN I was raised, yeah. 

01:13:55
PEGGY PAPP Talk about things and... 

01:13:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:14:00
PEGGY PAPP ...talk about feelings. 

01:14:00
JON CARLSON What was going on inside of you, what did you learn, when you heard him talk? 

01:14:05
3-3 

01:14:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, I'm thinking, he's telling me what's the most important thing in his life, which is to survive, and, that, uh, that's what he was taught and if you want something you go and get it. And he says, bottom line, so I know that one of his most profound beliefs is that the most important thing in life is to survive, and that, that comes before anything else. That's very important to know about him. Of course, the next thing I want to know is how does that work out in their relationship. 

01:14:40
JOHN CARLSON Yeah. 

01:14:40
PEGGY PAPP But, mainly I look at individual beliefs first, individual beliefs and attitudes, and then I, un, find out how they act on those and how that effects their relationship. 

01:14:55
Peggy Papp, M.S.W. 

01:14:55
JON CARLSON Well, as we watch this next segment, maybe that'll give us a base for putting them together. Because in this next piece we're gonna hear her tell her themes. 

01:15:05
PEGGY PAPP Right. 

01:15:10
PEGGY PAPP ...talk about feelings. 

01:15:10
3-4 

01:15:10
UNKNOWN I was really raised, like, I was the baby so I had, like, everything thrown at me, you know. So I know, like now, I have a lot of responsibility to learn, I have to get, I know I have to get more responsibility, 'cuz I don't really have all that. I mean, I'm responsible, I'm a mother so I'm responsible, I'm not a go getter. I'm not like, that's not one of my good parts of me. 

01:15:40
PEGGY PAPP But you didn't have to be responsible... 

01:15:40
UNKNOWN We talked about this. Like she said, she was, um, she was the youngest so everything was like done for her. She didn't have to worry about doing anything, everything was done. 

01:15:50
JON CARLSON What does this mean now? You've heard about him as a survivor, and you've heard about her being someone who's a baby, and, uh... 

01:16:00
3-5 

01:16:00
PEGGY PAPP So, that is the opposite, is that she was the one who was raised in a minister's family, with all the spiritual, uh, ideas, and, uh, taken care of. Excuse me. But the most important thing there, for me, is that she says, and I want to change that, that this is not good. That's what really rings a bell with me. He hasn't said that yet, you know, he hasn't said, well this is something I'd like to change, and she says I recognize this is not good and I really need to change it. 

01:16:35
JON CARLSON Okay. So there's different levels of motivation, she's very motivated to change, while he's not there yet. 

01:16:40
PEGGY PAPP Right. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:16:40
JON CARLSON Okay. Well, in this next clip we're gonna watch, you talk to them about being an interracial couple. Let's watch that. 

01:16:50
PEGGY PAPP Since your an interracial couple, did either of them have any problems with that. 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN Not a problem, not a problem what so ever. 

01:16:55
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

01:16:55
UNKNOWN That was never an issue, that issue, interracial never came up. 

01:17:00
PEGGY PAPP No? 

01:17:00
UNKNOWN No never, never came up, no. 

01:17:00
3-6 

01:17:00
UNKNOWN See I started interracial dating real young, at like 13, 13, 14, and my first relationship was kinda, you know, iffy. They kinda thought it was just a phase and I'd just go through it. But after they got over that and found out that it wasn't a phase, you know, I had some boyfriends before him. So when they did meet him they really liked him for who he was. 

01:17:25
PEGGY PAPP I see. 

01:17:25
UNKNOWN You know, they like him a lot. 

01:17:30
JON CARLSON Are you always this direct, Peggy, when you come right out and ask about this issue of race? 

01:17:35
PEGGY PAPP Yes, generally. Because it's obvious and I think it's very important, uh, to talk about it right from the beginning. Because obviously living in the kind of society we live in it's bound to be an issue of some sort or other, but they're telling me that it's not an important issue for them. 

01:17:50
JON CARLSON And you accept that? 

01:17:50
3-6 

01:17:50
Diane Kjos, Ph.D. 

01:17:50
3-6 

01:17:50
PEGGY PAPP Yes, mm-hmm, sure. I accept what they say, because I'm not gonna make a problem if there were not problems exists. If they say it's not a problem then I say, okay, fine it's not a problem. She's telling me that, um, her parents accepted him for who he was. So evidentially, uh, they have no in-law problems and, um, so why would I make a problem out of it if they're not making a problem out of it. I think the most important thing at this point are the cultural differences between them. The way, uh, because of the, uh, different, uh, backgrounds he was raised to survive and she was raised to be taken care of, that's the most important issue. 

01:18:40
JON CARLSON Some people might look at that though, and say the way he responded was really defensive. Did you see it that way? 

01:18:50
PEGGY PAPP No. In, in, in what way? 

01:18:55
JON CARLSON Well, he was defending that it wasn't a problem, kind of like he was, uh, gonna let you know it was okay, maybe you should leave this issue alone? 

01:19:05
PEGGY PAPP Well, if somebody tells me I should leave it alone, I'll leave it alone for the time being. If it becomes a problem later and, um, they might bring up some problems later, but right at the moment, uh, I will take it at face value, what they say. 

01:19:20
DIANE KJOS Well, I'm, I'm. 

01:19:25
3-8 

01:19:25
PEGGY PAPP They're actually telling me, you see, they're telling me that's not the issue between us, the issue between us are the, the different ways that we think, and our different ideas about how we should get together. 

01:19:35
DIANE KJOS Now I think that's more bothersome to them right now than anything else, is she's not responsible enough and he's not emotional enough. 

01:19:45
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, right, right. 

01:19:45
JON CARLSON Well, let's look at the next clip, in the next clip you're looking for motivation to change in this couple. 

01:19:55
PEGGY PAPP With her. So what's your idea of being romantic? 

01:20:00
UNKNOWN Well, I mean her idea of being romantic is coming home with flowers every night... 

01:20:05
UNKNOWN Every once in a while. 

01:20:05
UNKNOWN ...you know, doing little special stuff like that, bringing her a card every now and then. 

01:20:10
UNKNOWN Going out to dinner, or candlelight dinner. 

01:20:10
3-9 

01:20:10
UNKNOWN I just don't find a need for that. My thing romantic is that, hey you have everything that you need you don't have to worry about anything, what's the problem, you have everything you need what's the problem. You know, you want me to go out and buy all these roses, you want me to go out and buy all these cards, vases, and whatever, but you have everything you need. 

01:20:25
PEGGY PAPP So, so to you being romantic is having everything you need. 

01:20:30
UNKNOWN No, I can't see you can't. 

01:20:35
JON CARLSON You seem to accept his unusual way of thinking and his unusual ideas, what does this mean therapeutically? 

01:20:40
PEGGY PAPP Well, well, I accept his way of thinking because if I didn't, uh, I wouldn't be able then to, uh, understand where he's coming from. And, uh, he's telling me his idea of romance is that you take care of somebody, and actually that's a very important part of romance. Um, so, um, I really need to know that , but I'm also looking for that is there any other parts to romance, as he sees it. And, uh, I just wanted to keep exploring his ideas about that. 

01:21:20
JON CARLSON Well, in this next section we see something that, where he does take it to a different level. This is the piece where he buys cake, let's watch it. 

01:21:30
3-10 

01:21:30
PEGGY PAPP Right, right, okay. 

01:21:35
UNKNOWN Do something. 

01:21:35
PEGGY PAPP Gee, how did you happen to do that, how did you all of a sudden think about her and buy that for her? Seems very special. 

01:21:40
UNKNOWN It was probably on sale. 

01:21:40
UNKNOWN No, me and my son. 

01:21:45
PEGGY PAPP Well, if it tasted good. 

01:21:45
UNKNOWN My son and I were in the store and we were getting something eat and I seen the cake sitting there, so I said let's get mommy a cake, and he agreed to it of course so, that's why I got it. 

01:21:55
PEGGY PAPP I see. So it was just an idea that came to you? 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN Just popped up. 

01:22:00
PEGGY PAPP Oh, I see. 

01:22:00
UNKNOWN Right then I just looked and seen the cake, and I know that she likes sweets so, why not? 

01:22:05
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, so, um, did she seem to appreciate it? 

01:22:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:22:15
PEGGY PAPP Well, now I mean, did you seem to. 

01:22:15
UNKOWN Well, I mean, I guess she did because... 

01:22:20
UNKNOWN He left right away though. 

01:22:20
3-11 

01:22:20
UNKNOWN ...what happened was I brought the cake in, set the cake down, picked her up from work, came home, and then I went to sleep. Because I work midnights so I really didn't see her face reaction, I didn't see how she reacted about buying the cake. She told me, oh you bought me a cake thank you, and that was it. 

01:22:35
UNKNOWN But I really appreciated it. 

01:22:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, did that make you feel good that she appreciated it? 

01:22:35
UNKNOWN I mean, yeah it made me feel good, I didn't feel bad afterwards, okay she liked the cake. 

01:22:45
PEGGY PAPP Okay, okay. No I was just wondering, since it was a good experience for both of you if it would be an experience that you would want to have more often. You know, it also sounds like you can produce it. 

01:22:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can, I mean. 

01:22:55
PEGGY PAPP You can produce that kind of reaction in her. 

01:23:00
UNKNOWN I can. 

01:23:00
UNKNOWN Another thing. 

01:23:00
JON CARLSON What was happening here? 

01:23:00
PEGGY PAPP Well, I'm trying to find out if, uh, he would have an incentive to do something that was caring because of the affect it had on her, and if he would feel good about being able to produce that kind of effect. Because that would be an incentive to do more of that, so that's what I'm exploring there. 

01:23:25
JON CARLSON Is part of your thinking to instill more hope in their relationship and to try to increase this number of positive exchanges that go on? 

01:23:35
3-12 

01:23:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, yes because then, uh, I can ask if he would like to have anymore experiences like that, and if he can do it in any other ways, if this is something he would like to repeat. 

01:23:45
DIANE KJOS There was a point there where he, he almost felt uncomfortable about feeling good about it. He said, uh, I felt good, I didn't feel bad. 

01:23:55
PEGGY PAPP Well, for him right now, not feeling bad is a good thing. 

01:24:00
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. 

01:24:05
JON CARLSON What about her put down statement right away, and she does that now and then, the put down statement, oh it probably was on sale, and you laughed but you didn't deal with it. 

01:24:15
PEGGY PAPP I just ignore that. Yeah. 

01:24:15
JON CARLSON Some people might. 

01:24:20
PEGGY PAPP Why make an issue of it? I mean. 

01:24:20
3-13 

01:24:20
JON CARLSON Well, so she doesn't sabotage him. That could be the kind of thing that could really react to and would be quite sensitive to, I go out of my way to do nice things and, you know, you say it's on sale is the only reason I bought it. 

01:24:35
PEGGY PAPP But, but, but, as we go on we find out that she did appreciate it, that she did thank him, even though he went to sleep right away, but later on she thanked him for it, and she also tells us what she really appreciates, which is that it showed that he cared about her, he thought about her. That's what is really important to her. 

01:24:55
DIANE KJOS Even if it had been on sale it still would've been good. 

01:25:00
PEGGY PAPP Yeah, right. 

01:25:00
JON CARLSON Well, with more of a problem focus you would've attended to it then some theories are probably pretty problematically oriented, and would see this either as a put down to him or a self deprecating remark like, I'm not worth a cake. 

01:25:15
PEGGY PAPP See I wouldn't point out that it was deprecating of him, if he wanted to say it was deprecating of him then I would just explore his feelings about that. That how does he feel about it when she puts him down and what does he do about it, but I'm not going to be the one who... 

01:25:30
3-14 

01:25:30
JON CARLSON So if he would've reacted like, why did you say that then you would have pointed it out. 

01:25:30
PEGGY PAPP (crosstalk) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, then I would've said, well yeah, what does that do to you when she says that to you? Uh, but he ignored it, and, um, and, and at the moment it did not seem important to pick up on that. 

01:25:50
Jon Carlson, Psy. D., Ed. D., ABPP 

01:25:50
3-14 

01:25:50
JON CARSLON Well, in this next clip we're gonna see some more interesting dialogue from this couple as they talk about angels. 

01:26:00
PEGGY PAPP Oh, right. 

01:26:05
UNKNOWN You know what I wish I could do to him, I wish that I could tell him to ask himself what would get him into heaven, and that's it. Leave it at that, because if he would treat me... 

01:26:15
PEGGY PAPP What an interesting question. 

01:26:15
UNKNOWN ...yeah, if he would treat me like, like, um, an angel. 

01:26:25
PEGGY PAPP Yeah. 

01:26:25
3-15 

01:26:25
UNKNOWN And, like, if I treated him like an angel, if we both did that and we worried about what God would want from us, and not what other people in life want from us, that would be the relationship that I want. 

01:26:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, what would it be like if you were each treating each other as an angel? What would it be like if he treated you as an angel? 

01:26:45
UNKNOWN Well it would be, like, he would be concerned about how I felt, he would be concerned about, um, like, seeing a smile on my face, you know, and never, if, if I was treating him like an angel then I would never treat him wrong because that would be a sin. You know, I'm trying for a non-sinful life, it's hard because everybody has sin, but that's my goal in life. 

01:27:10
PEGGY PAPP Okay, so he. 

01:27:10
JON CARLSON What did this tell you, Peggy? 

01:27:15
3-16 

01:27:15
PEGGY PAPP Well, she's describing very specifically, what it would meant to be emotionally connected, and, uh, which is what she's asking for, uh, is that, uh, they would treat each other like angels, that he would listen to her, be good to her, she would do the same thing for him. I think that, uh, also she's worried about him, I think that she's worried that he doesn't have a good time, that, uh, he's, uh, he's too burdened, he's always worrying, that, uh, he's always feeling responsible, and I think she's trying to take him to a different level, she's trying to lead him into heave. She's trying to say, listen let's enjoy our life, let's enjoy each other, let's enjoy the baby, uh, and, uh, let's have a little happiness in our life. I think that's what she's trying to tell him, and actually I think he's listening. 

01:28:10
JON CARLSON Yeah, he was quite attentive. 

01:28:10
PEGGY PAPP I think she's trying to get something across to him, which is very important, and I think he's begun to listen. 

01:28:20
DIANE KJOS She's worried about his soul, in a sense. You're worried about all these temporal things, and I'm really worried about your soul. 

01:28:25
PEGGY PAPP Yes. Right, right. 

01:28:30
3-17 

01:28:30
JON CARLSON Well, in some ways this couple really does speak a different language, you know, that he has this language of security that he speaks and she has this one of deeper connection. They keep following those themes that that you've identified early on. 

01:28:45
PEGGY PAPP The idea, I think eventually, is that they can teach each other something important. She actually says that at one point, we can teach each other because he's tried to teach her about responsibility, and she's learned some things. She does say, I'm better at it now, she's trying now to teach him something about emotional connection and caring, and, uh. 

01:29:10
JON CARLSON So there is a give and take with this couple, that's gone on, that they have benefited from each other's specialness or differences. 

01:29:20
PEGGY PAPP Well, uh, right now it seems, at this point anyway, that she is the one who's saying she really wants to change. I haven't heard that from him yet, but that comes later on I think. 

01:29:35
JON CARLSON Well, he did buy a cake once. 

01:29:35
3-18 

01:29:35
DIANE KJOS That's because his son said it was a good idea. 

01:29:40
JON CARLSON In this next piece you really take this interview to a very different level. This is where you set up the fantasy experience, let's watch how you do that. 

01:29:50
PEGGY PAPP Okay. 

01:29:55
PEGGY PAPP You know, since you seem like a, a very adventurous couple, willing to try different things, uh, there's an exercise I do that I have found helpful in, uh, understanding how people experience a relationship, how each of you experience it in a different way. You've told me something about that, but, uh, this is kind of a fun, playful, imaginative, exercise and I was wondering would you be willing to try it? 

01:30:25
UNKNOWN If it's not beating each other with a Styrofoam bat, then okay. 

01:30:30
3-19 

01:30:30
PEGGY PAPP No, it's not doing that. You don't have to touch each other. Okay. Now it's just, uh, it's kinda fun and imaginative, and, and sometimes it's helpful. You know, because it gives you different images and different ways of communicating. Okay. Well, let's try it. Are you willing? 

01:30:55
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

01:30:55
JON CARLSON What were you hoping or what are you hoping to accomplish, you know, in this exercise and would not being able to use the bats seriously disrupt your approach? 

01:31:05
3-20 

01:31:05
PEGGY PAPP I'm hoping to, um, cut through the verbal patterns, the verbal script that they've gotten into, where they each say the same thing over and over again. I think each of them has heard the other person say the same over and over again, and take it to a different level. Uh, so that the fantasy provides a metaphorical description of the relationship rather than just a literal description. And they have to begin to think differently, in different terms. I think that he's very concrete in that he keeps very practical and down to earth, I mean, it's you do this and you do this, and it's like he can hardly understand what she's talking about some of the times, when she's talking about, heaven, and a different kind of relationship. So, um, this is, uh, something that provides them with a way of, uh, using their imagination to think in a totally different kind of way and to communicate in a different kind of way. 

01:32:15
DIANE KJOS Well, they got into it so beautifully and I, I was curious, you know, how did you dare introduce it to them. Cuz' I, what gives you the hint that this is a couple that's going to work this way? 

01:32:30
3-21 

01:32:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, I felt, you know, their, their, um, adventurous, they seem to be willing to try, uh, something new. Um, I must say though that 90% of the couples that I use this with are willing to do that. Even though in the beginning it seems like, uh, that, uh, they wouldn't go along with it, but most couples do. It catches their imagination in some way. 

01:32:55
JON CARLSON They really had fun. It seemed to be such an enjoyable way. 

01:33:00
PEGGY PAPP It loosens people up. 

01:33:00
JON CARLSON And yet they talked about these, in your work you call them, alterior things, and they were able to bring those out. 

01:33:10
3-22 

01:33:10
PEGGY PAPP Well, they have to begin to think, uh, in terms of symbols, and images, um, so that's on a different level of logic than we usually think. And it's also experiential because in order to go through the exercise and participate in it, you have to have some kind of physical experience, he has to experience what it's like to be down there as a cat, and the position of the bird flying around. Uh, then the questions that I ask are in terms of; how he responds to those and he tells me, well he doesn't really want to hurt her he only wants to scare her. And, um, in using this in the future to talk about their relationship one of the questions could be, what, what could you do other than scare her, and does scaring her really work or would there be something better, uh, better way to get what you really need than to scare her. 

01:34:20
JON CARLSON Is this kind of experiential learning, or is this metaphorical learning, is this necessary in the process of change, from your point of view? 

01:34:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, I don't think it's necessary, but I think that it is a very powerful tool. 

01:34:35
JON CARLSON So it's just one of the ways you could bring about change? 

01:34:40
PEGGY PAPP It is just one of the ways, yes. I always learn something different and I think the couple always learns something different, when they do the fantasies. 

01:34:45
3-23 

01:34:45
JON CARLSON Well, in this closing clip we're going to watch right after you came back from taking a break, before we watch the clip, what is that all about? Leaving the session and walking out of the room? 

01:35:00
3-24 

01:35:00
PEGGY PAPP You know, fantasies are so rich that I can't put them together at the same time that I'm following the process. So, I need a few minutes to be able to try and put them together, and think, well what would a theme be, and what, uh, do they have, uh, the fantasies have in common, what's different about them, and, uh, also what can I use as a first step towards change. In other words, um, how can I, uh, find out solutions within the fantasies. 

01:35:40
JON CARLSON So it's really not a therapeutic ploy that you're using, some strategic kind of thing to leave them alone for a while. It's really just to organize your thinking and make sure that. 

01:35:50
PEGGY PAPP Right. And generally I take a week to think about it because generally at the end of, I would say the end of the session, um, I really need some time to think about this, I will be watching back the video tapes, and I will give you some feedback next time. But since I didn't have that option here I asked for a few minutes. 

01:36:15
JON CARLSON Well, now we're gonna go into the clip and we are gonna have the opportunity to see your insights and maybe you should consider doing it in five minutes from now on rather than in a week. 

01:36:25
3-25 

01:36:25
PEGGY PAPP Okay. Well, listen I was really impressed with your fantasies and, uh, I went out and thought about them for a few minutes and, uh, the thing that struck me was that you both saw her as a bird. 

01:36:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:36:45
PEGGY PAPP And, uh, you both saw him on the ground somehow, I mean, very, uh, uh, connected with the ground. 

01:36:55
UNKNOWN Down to earth. 

01:37:00
PEGGY PAPP And, um, since you have both said that, uh, you would like to change this pattern of missing each other we were thinking that, um, in order for you not to feel so responsible, and so burdened, so you know, weighted down. What you would need to do would be to fly every now and then to learn to. 

01:37:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, but when I flew and came back then I'm gonna have to straighten up everything when I come back, cuz' it'll be all disarrayed. 

01:37:35
3-26 

01:37:35
PEGGY PAPP Well, not necessarily, you could learn to fly just a little bit and just kind of soar a little bit, and, uh, so it would be kind of nice. The thing that I was thinking that, uh, you would need to do in order to be more responsible, which you say, would be to yeah, come down to each more, and to be by his side. And, um, I was also thinking that, you know, if you are able to get black and white together as beautifully as you've done and your families together, that you certainly are capable of getting a cat and a bird together. And... 

01:38:20
JON CARLSON Wow, that was really nice that you allowed them to be different, cats and birds, and to be connected. 

01:38:25
3-27 

01:38:30
PEGGY PAPP Well, I tried to bring the interracial theme together with the differences in their fantasies. And since they had handled on so beautifully, uh, or seemed to be I was taking them by their word, which was a racial issue, that, uh, they could, uh, handle the other. And for the first time then he talks about change, and he says, yes, you know, I can change. Uh, so something happened in the process of him doing the fantasy that made him begin to think about, yeah there is a possibility, maybe of doing something different. And, uh, I used the metaphors in the fantasy, uh, to find a solution that they can then maybe apply, begin to apply in their lives, and, um, I like them to think about too about ways that they could, that he could fly, that she could come more down to earth. 

01:39:35
JON CARLSON I like the way that her hopefulness came through as she said, he already does fly he jumps out of airplanes, you know, he's really well on his way. 

01:39:45
PEGGY PAPP Yes, yes, and that could be used too in future sessions. 

01:39:50
3-28 

01:39:50
DIANE KJOS It was interesting watching their faces during that process, because there was that, both of them had hopeful and sort of, aha kind of looks on their face. And she knew exactly what she needed to do, she needed to come down to ground, you know, and flying sort of sounded interesting to him, and that was kind of intriguing to watch that. 

01:40:10
PEGGY PAPP Well, he did say that when he made up his mind to do something he could do it and so did she, and so I accepted that. 

01:40:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah. Now in future sessions would you go back to this? 

01:40:25
3-29 

01:40:25
PEGGY PAPP Yes, I would play the video tape back to them and I would ask for their response and, uh, I would also ask questions along the way like, uh, um, what do you think you could do different here, what do you think the bird could do different, and what could the cat do that would be different, and get them to begin to think, themselves, in terms of what's some solutions could be. 

01:40:55
JON CARLSON Well, thank you very much for helping us to be different kinds of birds and cats. We're on the road to becoming better brief therapists, thank you. 

01:41:05
