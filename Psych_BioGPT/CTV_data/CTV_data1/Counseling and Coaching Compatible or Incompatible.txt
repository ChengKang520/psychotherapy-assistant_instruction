Counselling and Coaching; Compatible or Incompatible? By Carol McGowan 

00:00:00
Australian Counselling Association Conference 2013 Gold Coast, Queensland - 26-27th September 2013 

00:00:20
CAROL MCGOWAN Just to give you a bit of background about myself, I would hate to admit it but I've actually been in the work force... it's my 40th year this year. Which is a bit of a scary thought, because it doesn't seem that long when I look back on it. So through my work experience, I've obviously experienced a lot of things, and at the age of 50 I went through a dramatic reinvention, I suppose you'd say, and changed career. I started out as an accountant, I then got involved in quality process and project management, and at 50 I trained as a counselor, and then took up training as a life coach, and then a business coach. My passion is the fact that I feel there are a lot of coaches out there who are playing in a space that perhaps they shouldn't. And so that's where my topic comes in here, coaching and counseling, compatible or incompatible. 

00:01:05
Starting Point 

00:01:05
Overview - Distinctions - Counselling and Coaching, Mental Health Continuum, Co-created Boundary, Factors Impacting Working at the Boundary, Navigating the Boundary, Case Studies - Discussion, Case Studies -Debrief, Key learnings and Insights 

00:01:10
CAROL MCGOWAN This is what we're going through first. We're gonna look at the distinctions between the two, as they have it in the literature, you know we might have our own opinions on this, but this is what the academic literature says about the distinction. A look at the mental health continuum, and how they try to make a distancing between what is coaching and what is counseling. A look at this co-created boundary, obviously between the client and the practitioner. Factors that impact working at the boundary. How we can navigate the boundary. And then we have a number of case studies, which are taken from people I've worked with, obviously their names have been changed. The other thing I wish to say is they have each given their permission for their scenario to be used, obviously knowing that it won't be their name that is on it. And also, these scenarios happened a little while ago now, so we're in a different place and space to when this first happened. And then we'll do a debrief, I'll put you into groups and you'll do the case studies. We'll have a debrief what we have learnt by having looked at the case studies. 

00:02:10
Distinctions between Counselling and Coaching 

00:02:15
CAROL MCGOWAN So, according to the literature, there's a number of distinctions between counseling and coaching. One of the key distinctions they make is the time focus. They say counselors are more likely to concentrate on things that happened in the past, and coaches more likely to be future focused. You know you start at a point and move forward. Counseling has a label of dysfunction or disorder associated with it, whereas coaching assumes that the person is highly functioning. Counseling is about personal healing and trauma recovery, whereas coaching is more about performance improvement. Counseling operates at psychological and emotional levels, whereas coaching is said to understand a wide variety of drivers and dynamics, including business. And, I must say, that my focus is very much from the business coaching perspective. I do do a lot of coaching, but where I'm making this particular distinction is in the realm of business coaching, 'cuz it's this thing that says you can do the business stuff without looking at the person, and I don't necessarily agree with that. It says that counseling is a confidential two way relationship, whereas with coaching it can be a three way relationship, and that's because the organization is one of the parties, often going to pay for the coaching the person has. And so you have to factor in this extra part of the relationship, and see how that works. And how you can keep confidentiality with the client, as in the one to one relationship you're having, but also you have responsibility to the organization. Counseling is required to have far more formal qualifications, whereas coaching is less formally regulated. For example, coaches do not have to have supervision. Coaches do not have to belong, it's not necessary to belong to a professional organization. Pretty much anyone can put life coach or coach after their name, without having to necessarily prove their credentials, or earn their strokes, if you like, by having worked with clients and learning techniques along the way. And then obviously with counseling you're often constrained by what you can charge for the service, whereas obviously from a workplace perspective, the rates are a lot higher, given the organization's paying. Apparently it's a bit like car repairs, if you pay yourself it's lower than if the insurance company's paying. 

00:04:35
Workplace Counselling and Business Coaching 

00:04:40
CAROL MCGOWAN Okay. This particular slide, the details here, are looking at the difference between workplace counseling and business coaching. Now workplace counseling, you get a problems with employees, and you recognize gaps in their performance. So they're not performing as you want them to perform. You seek to understand the cause of the problem, and there's this performance deficit, or there's something lacking aspect. It's often done in a remedial way, so not as a proactive strategy, but as a remedial strategy, emphasizing again the deficiencies and problems. It explores reactions and behaviors, and it's needs based and occasional, not necessarily consistent over time. Business coaching is used as a tool for continuing development and growth. Now having said that though, the initial entree of coaching into organizations was often used, as some would say, as a cop out for managers. Managers would not be able to get staff to do certain things, so they said, well, I'll get someone else in and see if they can fix them. So, also to help performance manage, so it was a bit like, I'll get someone else to do my dirty work. Now, that's where it started, it's certainly not where it is now, but that was one of the initial entrees of coaching in the business world. Business coaching emphasizes new competencies and actions, focuses on strengths and achievements, it's seen as more proactive, and seeks to identify and avert problems. And is also established over a specific time frame. So an organization will commit to how long they're willing to pay for one of their staff to actually be coached. 

00:06:15
Where does Counselling and Coaching Sit? 

00:06:20
CAROL MCGOWAN This particular diagram looks at what they call the mental health continuum. And it's said to run from minus 10 to plus ten. And they say that the distinction happens at the zero. And that counselors work, if you like, on the left hand side, or the negative side, and the coaches on the positive side, or the plus side. I see some pulling of faces, I don't necessarily agree with that, this is what is said. And you can see the sources down at the bottom. But this is the commonly accepted view. Now, having said that though, this distinction comes out of the coaching literature, not out of necessarily, the counseling literature. Okay? so, bear in mind that the frame of reference might influence this, I'm not saying that the model is invalid, but maybe there is some sort of bias there. But it talks about on the negative side with counseling, you've got the distress, emotional and mental disturbances, deep psychological issues and personality problems. Whereas obviously on the plus side, with the coaching, it's exceptional, highly skilled, and fully functioning. Now...yes? 

00:07:35
CAROL MCGOWAN Actually I don't have that slide in my this pack, I'm talking about that tomorrow afternoon, about how they all fit together. Um, I would say that, you want my opinion, or what the literature says? My personal opinion is that psychotherapy can work across all of it. That's my personal opinion. Because you can't really divorce the person from what they do. Whether it's in their life or their work, or whatever. And depending on what their issues are, the you might need to use those skills. So, you know, this organization obviously runs for counselors and psychotherapists, so if you want to read counseling as counseling and psychotherapy, you can. But that's where we're starting from, it may not be where we end up, by the time we finish this. I beg your pardon? 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:08:30
CAROL MCGOWAN No. It can be something people just put on there, counselor and...is that what you mean? 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Well, let's say you didn't have counseling qualifications... [inaudible] 

00:08:50
CAROL MCGOWAN I don't know, is my honest answer to that question, what the legalities are. I'm all for meeting with...you can? 

00:08:55
UNKNOWNS (inaudible ) 

00:09:05
CAROL MCGOWAN Thank you very much. There's far more learned people in the room than I am, about that. But good question. Thank you for helping answer the question. So, I put this up, as I said, to help us understand how a lot of people view the distinction between coaching and counseling. I'm a transitions coach. When I started out in my personal transition I thought I was going to be a counselor who coached. I'm actually a coach who counsels, but I'm very glad I do both. And I've also found that a lot of my clients do come to me because I do do both. We can straddle the boundary, and I have the skills, and I continue to develop my skills to be able to do that. I do a lot of work with people who've just lost their job, so there's a lot of outplacement coaching, and of course, when people lose their jobs, they're in a very vulnerable position. And if they're already in a vulnerable position, it makes them even more vulnerable. You know, I've just bought a new house, or my wife lost her job last week, or something like that. So that's what started to get me thinking about this, because I knew the number of times people were coming to me for coaching, and yet I was having to counsel them. One of the classics was, I had a client come to me, we were in about our third session, we were going to practice interview skills on this particular day, for this person. And I asked him, how are you? And he said not too good. And I said, what's happened? He said, my cousin just died, and I was his best friend. Now this person had just lost their job. He then went on to also tell me, and it might be one of the case studies here, he lost his job, he had to have surgery when he'd never had to have surgery before, and now his cousin had died. Now, I would have been irresponsible if I'd ignored that. In the interests of my client. That's the sort of thing that triggered my interest in this, again. 

00:11:00
Co-Created Boundary 

00:11:05
CAROL MCGOWAN I did a Masters in Business Coaching, and I have to do a research project. And the research project I did I actually presented two years ago at this conference. But the topic of it was, do business coaches think they need counseling skills. And surprisingly enough, many thought they didn't. But the scary part was, more people thought they used counseling skills with clients than those who thought they needed to use them. So that, again, this is where we've got people playing in a space where they perhaps shouldn't be, 'cuz they don't necessarily have the skills to be. Anyway, one of the ratings that I did in that I found very helpful, and it was by a lady called Alison Maxwell, and it was about, how do business coaches experience the boundary between coaching and therapy counseling? And, I was fortunate enough, on a trip to England, not long after I found this, to actually meet her, and we got to talk about it. So that was even better, to meet the author. She works at Oxford Brooks University, in London. And I think her model is really, really good, which we'll get more into in a minute. So I wanted to obviously raise the profile a bit about that, and get some discussion on it. And that's what I hope to do as part of this. To try to explore what this model's about, and how do counselors think what it's value is. But in her article, she talks about this c0-created boundary, and says there's two axes to think about. You've got the coach's willingness and ability, and you've also got the client's willingness and ability. Now, the first section is, avoided exploration, that's where neither is willing to go to the space. Neither the client or the coach is willing to explore. You've got deep exploration, that means both are appropriately willing and equipped to go to the deeper spaces that the client might need to go. If you've got frustrated exploration that means the client wants to go there, but the coach won't take them there. Or the practitioner, but in this case it's the coach. Or you've got forced exploration, when the coach makes someone go where they don't want to go. So, this was some of the factors that she took into account. Now in her research she interviewed eight highly skilled practitioners. Four were trained psychologists, and four were very skilled as business coaches. One of the defects, I think, of her research, was her aiming at that very high end and not grass roots label of practitioner, and it was psychologists and coaches, and it wasn't this counseling consideration as well. Because a lot of psychologists coach as well. And I must say, in my work in the University of Wollongongin New South Wales, where I did my Masters in Business Coaching, and a lot of the practitioners and educators there come from a psychologist background. 

00:14:05
Factors Impacting working at the Boundary 

00:14:05
Client - motivations, willingness, resourcefulness. Petitioner - ethics, perception of role, personal competence. Context - for engagement of practitioner 

00:14:10
CAROL MCGOWAN So this is looking at the factors impacting working at the boundary between coaching and counseling. There's obviously the client motivations, their willingness, and their resourcefulness. So how able are they to do it. The practitioner, their ethics, their perception of their role, and their personal competence. And I think my laboring is on this personal competence. And then of course the context. What is the context that you have been engaged with? This is where it gets tricky for a business coach. For example, with that gentleman I mentioned, I was hired to do outplacement work with him. But I felt that as a practitioner I was irresponsible if I ignored his grief. But it can be tricky...yes sorry, I didn't see your hand up. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:15:30
CAROL MCGOWAN That's a really great question. And that's what this whole thing's about. it's about, how do you make the distinction, do you need to make the distinction, when do you make the distinction? And that's where it's really fuzzy. And that's part of why I wanted to do what I'm doing now. But we can talk about that, look at cases. And I'm gonna offer a particular framework about how we do that, that's what I'm sort of leading up to, and maybe that will answer your question. If we haven't answered, as we pass on, before we finish, could you raise that again? But I think it's right, it's not just business coaching, it's just that's an easy one to use as an example. But the conflict doesn't only happen in a business coaching context. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:16:15
CAROL MCGOWAN Absolutely. That's why a lot of my clients come to me. Because they know I do both, and they can say they're going to their coach, without saying, well I'm also going to counseling too. So, yes, that's part of a problem. That probably doesn't answer your question, but, maybe as we progress on, some of that might get clearer. Is that okay? Okay, if not, we can talk about it off line later if that's all right, okay? All right. 

00:16:45
Factors impacting working at the Boundary - Client, Practitioner, Context 

00:16:50
CAROL MCGOWAN So this was just on this page, I had written what the three factors were, and for those that are more visual, I have simply, maybe this is my educator training, I have just provided a diagram that shows...now I'm sorry it's as dark, it's not as dark on my copy as what it looks like up there. It says co-created boundary in the center thing, and these are the three factors that come in to play for the co-created boundary. 

00:17:15
Categories of Cross Boundary Issues 

00:17:15
Transient or Present Day - triggered by a recent event eg: redundancy, bereavement 

00:17:15
Entrenched Historic - a behavioural pattern playing out in the present day 

00:17:15
Hybrid - recent events trigger an historic pattern or response to distress 

00:17:20
CAROL MCGOWAN Again in Maxwell's work she talks about the categories of things that come up that cross the boundary. It talks about transient or present day, things that just have come up recently, fairly immediate or fairly recent. You've got entrenched history, a behavioral pattern playing out in the present day. We've talked a lot about this type of thing, of the behavioral patterns. And then you've also got the thing about an historic pattern and a response to distress. Okay, so that's just a way to think about some of the factors that are contributing, or you might need to think about the boundary. 

00:17:55
Navigating the Boundary 

00:18:00
CAROL MCGOWAN Now, this is the diagram of the model, and I'm going to read you some more about this in a minute, but this is the four aspects that Maxwell has brought up around navigating the boundary. The first one is separation. You make a very clear distinction between personal and other, and you don't cross it. hard and fast, don't move. The second one is rational. Only discuss them in a logical, intellectual, and unemotive fashion. So you keep any emotion out of it, and we all know how realistic or otherwise that might be. We have the dipping in. So you go in and out as required. Or, you've got straddling the line. Acknowledge and work with the whole person, and make no attempt to avoid it. Now, I'm going to give you a little bit more detail from the article about each of those because getting a little bit more understanding of these is going to be relevant to working the case studies that I've got here for us to do. Okay, so separation. Avoid any discussion of personal matters. Here the coach tries to minimize the discussion of personal material. And compartmentalizes this from the discussion agenda. There is recognition that this is difficult to achieve, and inadvertent comments could trigger unexpected reactions. so, these are her comments from findings doing this research. Rational working, here coaches take what might be termed as rational or cognitive approach. So it's only at that thinking level. Attempting to engage their clients of a discussion of personal matters in an intellectual or dispassionate way. This was seen as a very fruitful approach, particularly for those clients who are uncomfortable with emotional or personal matters, and who seem to have limited ability or desire to connect with their internal and external experiences. Then we've got dipping in. So this was selective visits to personal history, and selective uses of approaches drawn from psychology and psychotherapy. And that may have been the ones that were trained in that field. As I said this was done with Psychologists and psychotherapists. This approach was used particularly when the origins of the work performance issue, or a block of some sort was seen to originate in personal or historic material, and the client was deemed suitably resourced to look at this material. And then the fourth one is straddling the line. It says here, three of the therapist coaches talked in terms of straddling, bridging, or shuttling across the coaching therapy boundary. Rather than attempting to avoid the personal, historical, or emotional, these coaches tend to see these dimensions of their clients as central and causal to their work performance, and therefore as potentially legitimate and necessary territory for exploration. That's just a little bit more about each of the different aspects here. 

00:20:45
Case Studies - Group Discussion 

00:20:45
Read the following 4 case studies, writing your answers (optional) to the questions at the end of each case study. What follows after each case study is a discussion between the presenter and workshop participants. 

00:20:45
Case Study 1 - Emily 

00:20:45
Client Details - Mid forties, divorced with two children. Came to Australia from England at 16 and left all her friends and family behind. Son in late teens who has ADD and is about to leave school to get an apprenticeship and a daughter in early teens with ADHD and will not take her medication. Also has aspects of histrionics. Ex husband has little contact with the children. She is in the process of having to sell her house as part of the divorce settlement. 

00:20:45
Case Study 1 - Emily (continued...) 

00:20:45
Presenting Issue - Emily is wanting assistance to help undertake her move from the house she has lived in since she got married. Her financial situation is not ideal. She is looking to change jobs as a company restructure has left her current tenure in jeopardy and she wants to leave of her own accord but is feeling unsure about it. 

00:20:45
Questions - Remembering what we have discussed so far regarding the boundary between coaching and counseling how would you answer the following questions? - How would you work with this client? Which of the four approaches would you use? What leads you to using this approach rather than the other alternatives? How would you feel and respond in this situation? What factors do you believe are important to consider when working with this client? 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:22:45
CAROL MCGOWAN Everybody, I think it's time we hear what the various opinions are. I'm going to start with this group. Which do you have? Who's your case study? Emily. Hang on, I'll read out about Emily. So Emily. She is mid forties, with two children. Came to Australia from England at 16 and left her friends and family behind. Son is in late teens, and he has ADD, and is about to leave school to get an apprenticeship, and has a daughter in her early teens with ADHD, and will not take her medication. Also has aspects of histrionics. Ex husband has little contact with the children. She is in the process of having to sell her house as part of the divorce settlement. Her presenting issue was that Emily is wanting assistance to help undertake her move from the house she has lived in since she got married. Her financial situation is not ideal. She is also looking to change jobs as a company restructure has left her current tenure in jeopardy, and she wants to leave of her own accord but is feeling unsure about it. Okay? None of these are simple, straight forward things. Okay, so I'm going to give you guys the microphone, 'cuz we have to be able to be heard. 

00:24:00
[sil.] 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Can everyone hear? 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN All right. I hate speaking in front of anybody. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN That was fear ridden, because you know... 

00:24:30
CAROL MCGOWAN That was a fear response, yeah. [laughter] 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Okay, so we completely ignored the first question, we went straight to which of the four approaches would you use, and we said rational. We agreed, in general on rational. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWNS [inaudible] 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN I had a bot of problem with rational to start with, and I initially felt I would completely separate the first issue of the children. And then I came to the point where I looked at it a little bit longer, and I would straddle the line. Because I felt [00;25:15]that I needed to acknowledge the whole person, if you like. And then I was convinced at the end that I was actually working from a rational perspective. So, there you go. If that doesn't confuse things I don't know what will. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWNS [inaudible][laughter] 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN Thanks Will. Okay, so the question was, what led you to using this approach, rather than the other alternatives? Well, we felt that this client was very goal orientated. And the details just placed it in a context of limited financial means. But we thought we needed a lot of mindfulness around the clients lack of support, seeing that as a pretty big red flag. The next question was, how would you feel and respond to the situation? And I believe that the answer is client led, allow the client to lead where they want to go. The other thing, being very self-aware, I'd need to bracket my own need to counsel. What factors do you believe are important to consider when working with this client? The two big red flags were lack of support and major changes. So keeping an eye on those while maintaining a goal. 

00:26:45
WILL Well done. 

00:26:50
CAROL MCGOWAN Thank you. I have a couple of questions back to the team, if that's okay? You said she was goal oriented, what led you to that conclusion? 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:27:05
CAROL MCGOWAN Okay. The fact that she wanted to help with the move led you to the conclusion that she was goal oriented. 

00:27:15
WILL [inaudible] 

00:27:20
WILL She's obviously very connected to the home, having lived there since the marriage. But she's going through a divorce, and selling the house is one of the outcomes that must happen, so the house must get sold. So there's that external pressure. So, that would put a time element into the equation. Judgement might be impaired because of the emotional connection to the home. And not having an outside support network, we gather that from the context. 

00:28:05
CAROL MCGOWAN [inaudible] 

00:28:10
WILL Yes. So, someone like that wanting to sell a house, approaching real estate agents without a support network might be a bit scary. So some kind of step by step process, whereby she could effectively get the house sold. 

00:28:30
CAROL MCGOWAN [inaudible] 

00:28:35
CAROL MCGOWAN The other question I wanted to ask, you said be careful of your own desire to counsel. Could you say more about that? 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Well, I guess I like to help people. And I guess if I was seeing this client as a coach, I wouldn't see quite the same personal connection and involvement that I see with counseling. Less of an emotional connection, personally. 

00:29:05
CAROL MCGOWAN Less of your own personal connection to the client? Okay. All right. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN I would probably, I would certainly acknowledge the emotional connection she has to the home. And be understanding of her reservations about selling the house. But as the coach, I need to clarify for her that they are the external requirements that have to be met, in spite of her feelings about the home. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:45
CAROL MCGOWAN Does anyone have any questions of this group? Okay, we'll go on to our next one. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:29:55
CAROL MCGOWAN Oh, what he said about going through the plan, for with the move. Yes, I probably should give you a wrap up about what happened. Sorry. To break it down into something she could manage, and would enable her to take some steps, we did work on her doing a to do list. So that she could feel that she could get control over something. She kept saying, you know I've got to do all these things, and I've got no one to help me. So, we talked to her about that to do list. And the next time I saw her she'd done it. I then asked her, okay, tell me about what benefit it has given you, by doing the list, so it wasn't just an idea that we'd come up with and it had no value to it. I checked in with her what the value was for her, and she said it did enable her to feel a greater sense of control around that particular aspect. And there was some sense of containment almost, doing it. Does that answer your question? I'm mean we'll gone along and done a lot more since then, but... 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:31:05
CAROL MCGOWAN Oh no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. This happened probably about three or four years ago. We took two and a half years to get her to a place of competency. And that was mixing both, straddling the line, dipping in...sort of. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:31:35
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, the parenting with the children, especially the daughter, extremely resistant, she's still having issues with her now, because she still won't take her medication, and there's been police issues, and all sorts of horrible stuff. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:31:50
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, we are not still regularly seeing each other, but we have to meet in catch ups, having said that though, the client is much more able and equipped now, through doing both with her, to cope with the stuff from having learned to do to-do lists, and various other things, and getting a greater understanding of her own resourcefulness, taking time out to root for herself, you know, getting herself away from the morass of what's going on around her in her life. 'Cuz she also had depression issues, so we had to make sure she went and got treatment for that. Bla bla bla, okay? Okay. But she came to me as a coach. so we'll go on to your group actually, that's where I as going to go. Your case study is? 

00:32:35
Case Study 2 - Lionel 

00:32:35
Client Details - Mid thirties, married and trying to have first child. Investment banker and Financial Services Executive. Highly successful in his career and financially secure owning his home. Presenting issue - Lionel wants to change careers from high powered corporate life with significant international travel and exposure to starting his own business. - He arrives at the first session with his Business Plan prepared. He is very organized and focused. He knows what he wants to do. Has applied all his business expertise to developing his plan. 

00:32:35
Case Study 2 - Lionel (continued...) 

00:32:35
Presenting Issue (continued...) - He works together with his coach steadily for a year. Intensely for the first six months and then less frequently over the remainder of the year. The client appears all ready and prepared to make his desired move. Six months later he does make a move however he moves into a similar role to one he already has. He does not see his coach for over a year and then he returns with the same issue he presented initially. He reiterated his earlier frustrations with his role and that he is well set financially and yet he still has not made his desired move. He is trying to understand what is holding him back from making the move to be self-employed. 

00:32:35
Questions - Remembering what we have discussed so far regarding the boundary between coaching and counseling how would you answer the following questions? - How would you work with this client? Which of the four approaches would you use? What leads you to using this approach rather than the other alternatives? How would you feel and respond in this situation? What factors do you believe are important to consider when working with this client? 

00:32:40

CAROL MCGOWAN So Lionel. Lionel's in his mid thirties, married and trying to have first child. Huh? 

00:34:00
CAROL MCGOWAN Mid thirties. He is. Mid thirties, married and trying to have a first child. And he's an investment banker and financial services executive, highly successful in his career and financially secure owning his home in a very good area. Wants to change careers from high powered corporate life with significant international travel and exposure to starting his own business. He arrives at the first session with his business plan prepared, and I can tell you, it was one of the most comprehensive ones I've ever seen, and I've been doing business planning for many, many, many years. He is very organized and focused. He knows what he wants to do. Has applied all his business expertise to developing his plan. He works together with his coach steadily for a year. Intensely for the first six months and then less frequently over the remainder of the year. The client appears all ready and prepared to make his desired move. Six months later he does make a move however he moves into a similar role to one he already has. He does not see his coach for over a year and then he returns with the same issue he presented with initially. He reiterates his earlier frustrations with his role, and that he is well set financially and yet he still has not made his desired move. He is trying to understand what is holding him back from making the move to being self-employed. We need a spokesperson, sorry. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWNS [inaudible] 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN We looked at the whole thing, and we kind of discussed a little bit, and thought we would jump to question two first, which of the four approaches would you use, and we came up with straddling the line, and we also looked at dipping in, and kind of thought they were very similar. But we thought we needed both approaches. So I personally thought this person needed more counseling than therapy initially, because he'd already done every thing he could do from a business plan perspective and a coaching perspective. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN So what led you to use this approach rather than other alternatives? Um, I would see straddling the line as being able to go into a coaching way of working really easily, but also reflecting back and going into more of the personal issues where there probably were the blocks, I would imagine. 

00:36:40
CAROL MCGOWAN [inaudible] 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Somebody in the group said that fear, or we didn't know what happened to his family, or children, we didn't know that, yeah. We kind of reflected on what could possibly be holding him back, but we all said we needed that exploration to find out. Which would mean more of a therapy counseling probably. 

00:37:10
CAROL MCGOWAN Okay. So, answering the question this time that I forgot to answer for this group... it was about fear. This person's issue was actually around finance. He had a whole range of irrational beliefs around finance, and what you needed to be secure. And it took... it took him to get to a point of frustration, because he's an extremely competent person. So it took him to a point of having to get to a real sense of frustration, and that block, you know, it was almost to a point of desperation before he could suddenly get to the point of, okay, it's about the money. There's something I have about the money, and we explored that a bit more. And in exploring that he has since made the move to being self employed. Okay? But it took, going from the same to the same. And then going, but this just isn't working. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:38:20
CAROL MCGOWAN After. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:38:40
CAROL MCGOWAN In fact, initially having a child made it worse. It actually made his fear worse. Because he felt this extra sense of responsibility because he had a child. So it actually initially made it worse. Until we explored that he was well equipped to provide for his child and all of that sort of thing. But initially it made it worse. It actually delayed what he could have done even further. All right? On the table down the back you have Brian. I'll tell everybody about Brian. Brian's the one I mentioned earlier. 

00:39:15
Case Study 3 - Brian 

00:39:15
Client Details - Mid forties, married with two children under 12. Has just recently had his position made redundant with a major corporation. He has occupied a senior and responsible IT position within the organisation. Context - The coach's role is to provide outplacement assistance (external coaching support) to help with writing his resume, preparing cover letters, and enhancing and developing interview skills. 

00:39:15
Case Study 3 - Brian (continued...) 

00:39:15
Client Scenario - Brian has had 3 sessions so far having discussed his situation, revamping his resume and writing a cover letter and some very preliminary interview practice. This is to be their final formalized face to face session before he leaves his current employer. At the beginning of the final session Brian was asked, "how are you?" Especially given his leaving day is only one week away. His response, "my cousin died 3 days ago and we were best friends". He then went on to advise he had recently had to have some minor surgery, and up to know he has never been ill before. He feels he needs to put on a brave face as a father and husband. 

00:39:15
Questions - Remembering what we have discussed so far regarding the boundary between coaching and counseling how would you answer the following questions? - How would you work with this client? Which of the four approaches would you use? What leads you to using this approach rather than the other alternatives? How would you feel and respond in this situation? What factors do you believe are important to consider when working with this client? 

00:39:20

00:41:00
CAROL MCGOWAN So Brian is mid forties, married with two children under 12. He's just recently had his position made redundant with a major corporation. He had occupied a senior and responsible IT position. The coach's role is to provide outplacement assistance, to help him with writing his resume, preparing cover letters, and enhancing and developing his interview skills. Brian has had 3 sessions so far having discussed his situation, revamping his resume and writing a cover letter and some very preliminary interview practice. This was to be his final formalized session, 'cuz in the arrangement I had they get four sessions. At the beginning of the final session was asked, how are you? Which I said before, given he was leaving, and he was due to leave the next day. So I was seeing him the day before he was due to leave the organization. And that's when he told me about his cousin had died, and they were best friends. Also that he'd had the minor surgery, and up to know he has never been ill before. And he feels he needs to put on a brave face as a father and husband. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Okay. Well, I'll speak, and then I'll let my other team members correct me. The first question is, how would you work with this client? Because it's the final session, and by and large, most of the coaching work, like the revamping his resume, and interviewing practice had been done, and with this new thing with the grief, and so I would probably, just hold him...in a holding position. Just listen. Yeah, okay. But which, again? The second question first. Which of the four approaches... Ellen and I decided that we would probably do the dipping in. And with dipping in we would also recommend that he sees a therapist, because as a coach I am not skilled to do grief counseling, and it would be unethical and irresponsible if I did so. What leads you to use this approach rather than the alternative approach? um, I think I answered that question already. How would you respond and feel in this situation? I think I answered that. Really, he's just sitting with a client, if he wanted to talk about the death, you know, I certainly wouldn't stop him, but I would not do any therapeutic intervention, because I am a coach. what factors do you believe are important? The factors I would be risk, he's a risk of depression, and he may even be needing medication. And that's why a referral to someone, you know, more skilled in those areas, would be the ethical and right thing to do. That's my opinion, and I think Ellen's, but I'm not sure, 'cuz we didn't quite get to discuss all of 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Well, I would look at the first one, basically this client has a lot of losses. He's lost his job, and that is a senior position. I know that as a coach you would also consider that as a loss, that sort of stuff, but not necessarily in a therapeutic way. So, I'd look at that, and then at the last minute he brought in this really sad set of things, at the point when he's almost ready, and finalized everything. So the coaching's already well and truly progressed much, and brought in all this emotional stuff. So yeah, I would agree that you've done your job basically, but it's important to acknowledge. I think acknowledge all of it, which is dipping in. Just acknowledge that you've got all these things, without necessarily going to therapeutic work, but just really acknowledge the bad news as a human being, and then... 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN I actually forgot to say something that we did discuss, and that is, I would probably say to the client that i would continue the coaching, because if he needed more in depth interviewing practice and things like that, I'd be happy to do that. I would recommend that in parallel he would see a psychotherapist, along with what we would be doing. I think that would be the most ethical thing to do. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:40
CAROL MCGOWAN So, again, what happened on the day was a bit like you said, let him express what he was feeling, 'cuz it was the one place he had to do that. Because, as it said, he felt he needed to be a strong father and husband. And he hadn't had a place for him to go and feel his own pain around it. He was trying to be strong for everyone else around him. So, I just let him express. and what I did was, I encouraged him to go and spend some time on his own, and allow himself to We did come back to doing the interview skills practice at a later point. But he was not in the place to do it that day, so we just let him have some time to sit with his grief and feel it. I'd made sure he was okay of course, and not at any risk. I think we had another week or two, and we finished it off. And he found it valuable to just have that breathing space for himself. That was what he needed most at that time. But having done some training in grief I was able to work that through and support him appropriately. If I hadn't been I would have referred him to someone else at that point. Okay? And the final one is Claire. 

00:47:55
Case Study 4 - Claire 

00:47:55
Client Details - early forties with 3 grown up children only one still living at home. Currently estranged from elder sister and mother. daughter advises she is pregnant and she is a teenager. Claire is seen as the hub within her family both immediate and extended and is expected to hold everything together and to keep everyone happy. 

00:47:55
Case Study 4 - Claire (continued...) 

00:47:55
Presenting Issue - Looking to set herself up in her own coaching business when she relocates from a small country town to capital city. As sessions with Claire progress it becomes known that she has a tendency to want to control everything and yet now she is starting to feel the burden this brings. She is feeling guilty for wanting to focus on what she needs rather than the needs of her family. 

00:47:55
Questions - Remembering what we have discussed so far regarding the boundary between coaching and counseling how would you answer the following questions? - How would you work with this client? Which of the four approaches would you use? What leads you to using this approach rather than the other alternatives? How would you feel and respond in this situation? What factors do you believe are important to consider when working with this client?

00:49:35
CAROL MCGOWAN Claire's early forties with 3 grown up children only one still living at home. Currently estranged from elder sister and mother. Her daughter advises she is pregnant and she is a teenager. Claire is seen as the hub within her family both immediate and extended and is expected to hold everything together and to keep everyone happy. She's looking to set herself up in her own coaching business when she relocates from a small country town to a capital city. As sessions with Claire progress it becomes known that she has a tendency to want to control everything and yet now she is starting to feel the burden this brings. She's feeling guilty for wanting to focus on what she needs rather than the needs of her family. and I mean her family of origin, as opposed to her and her husband's family. She's getting drawn from the bigger family. And we have the gentlemen team down here... 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:50:30
CAROL MCGOWAN Has she? Okay, I'll leave it to you guys to sort out. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Presuming this is your client, I imagine, there's nothing initially psychological in there, so I imagine she came to you for business advise, about setting up this thing. In which case we were talking about doing the dipping in thing, just explore, elaborate kind of thing, and see what might come of that, with the option of straddling the lines sort of stuff, with the possibility that there might be more to this guilt thing and to this controlling tendency. As we were talking about, given that, 'cuz there was no mention of a husband or anything like that, she's estranged from a couple people from her immediate family. 

00:51:30
CAROL MCGOWAN [inaudible] 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Okay, it does not mention it here, so we... And she has a couple of grown up children who have left, and then one who has gotten pregnant as a teenager. So we wondered whether she was missing the opportunity to be controlling, and whether there was a possibility she, not necessarily consciously, but she saw the coaching thing as an opportunity to control other people. From the point of view of saying, here's some things you can do, here are some ways you can fix your life, 'cuz she can't tell it to the daughters anymore, 'cuz they left, and she's somewhat estranged, and she's now going to have to take the nana role with this daughter with a child, rather than the controlling mother role that she would have had previously. And so she may be missing the controlling thing. And doing this dipping in and straddling the line, it may eventuate that being a life coach is not necessarily the right job for you anyway. Because you may not get as much satisfaction out of it if you can't be as controlling as you'd like to be. Told you it was an interesting theory, might not necessarily be a good one. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWNS [laughter] 

00:52:50
UNKNOWNS [inaudible] 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN And here's Michael. 

00:53:05
MICHAEL I'll only be brief. How long have you got? We were thinking this was a bit of an empty nest remedy for her, with all the kids leaving now, up and moved to the big city, and to get some more people you can help, that you can mother. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN And I think the glaringly obvious thing is there's a massive transition for this person. So the transitions we highlighted around family being the daughters leaving, the pregnancy, potentially control issues, which came out in the sessions, the relocation from country to city, a focus on the self from the mothering social fabric concept to the self, and then that sort of led us into the two bottom sections. I actually think it's counter to what Mark said, we actually, probably talked about straddling the line first, and then referring back to dipping in. So if you can't take everything on at once you can go and take little chunks off, and work on that. But I certainly think, from my position, I don't think she can look at business coaching until she resolves all of that. There's seven things there that you can work on before you even got to the business coaching aspect. 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN If you started with the straddling the line thing straight away, if you started with a counseling approach straight away, client may say, that's not what I'm here for, I'm okay, I don't need help along those lines. I just want you to look at my business case. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN And wrapped around that is potentially escapism, from whatever was in the country and whatever is happening in the family. Right? So there's an escapism aspect. There's a new approach to the way she's gonna tackle life, and new mechanisms gonna be formed out of that. If you want to know more about that come and see my talk tomorrow. And I think she needs to be grounded first in her new life before she can organize others. How do you organize someone else when you're trying to organize yourself? And that's where we left it. Does anyone else...? Talk tomorrow, keynote at the end, yep, John's got... 

00:55:35
CAROL MCGOWAN We have a few closing speakers in the room. Okay. 

00:55:40
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:55:45
CAROL MCGOWAN This was not meant to be a free plug session, but okay. [laughing]It's not me that's doing the plugging. anyway, so, you're right. We had to ground her. We had to do some coaching sessions, a bit like the client over here with a to-do list. It had to be a bit like, how can we get some containments around all that's happening for you. We did do that, it got to a point then...I coached her till she got to, Carol can you now counsel me? And the counseling was around the fact that she hadn't realized how much she had controlled. How much that was almost the essence of her being. She hadn't realized the magnitude in her life, and the impact it was having on her life, and how stressed she got when it wasn't as she thought it would be. And that was on all the levels you talked about. You know, her immediate family, her extended family, within the workplace, going between where she used to live ad where she is now to have contacts with family, and other people, and stuff like that. So, actually we had a session just recently that was definitely a counseling session, and we had the hugest breakthrough, it was so rewarding, 'cuz she now finally gets what impact control has had in her life. 

00:57:10
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:57:15
CAROL MCGOWAN No, she controlled herself as well. It was endemic. If you like. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:57:25
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, yes, yes. and she's now got to a point that she understands that. 

00:57:30
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:57:35
CAROL MCGOWAN We have monthly sessions now, and we're probably in our second year. But we started off with the coaching, we did have a bit of a gap in that, now we're back onto monthly sessions. I do them by phone actually, 'cuz she's not in the same capital city I am. But that hasn't hindered us because we developed our relationship very strongly to do that. And the last six months has very much been in that counseling space, and understanding the impact of control in her life, and it has been, without meaning to sound cliched, taking away the layers of the onion to get to the core. And I think we got there a couple of weeks ago. Believe it or not she's now got a job as an IT consultant, an IT training consultant. So she does get to coach people but not in the way you would imagine. 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:58:40
CAROL MCGOWAN No, but that wasn't her thing, it's more about the training of it, and not the actual technology and stuff. 'Cuz that's not her thing. Yes, because it's quite defined, if you like. Okay. So I'm interested now in people's comments about navigating the boundary between coaching and counseling. I've talked about it, we've done some exercises, I'm interested in getting people's thoughts about it. 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN I would say that counselors are really, really well qualified to do coaching. 

00:59:40
CAROL MCGOWAN That's my point. 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

00:59:50
UNKNOWN Can I ask you what qualification do people need to be a coach, and what sort of time frame to complete those qualifications? And the second question is, are they also subject to the same mandatory reporting laws as counselors are? And if not, that's pretty darn dangerous. 

01:00:10
CAROL MCGOWAN I feel like saying, I rest my case. Coaches are not required to have anything, anyone can say they're a coach. Okay? They are not required to have professional affiliations, CPD, it's encouraged, but it's not mandatory. I personally belong to a professional coaching association, where I'm required to do that. As well as obviously the Australian Counselling Association. I'm a Master Coach with the Australian, New Zealand Institute of Coaching. but it's not required. We talk about mandatory reporting and all that, but coaches don't come under that umbrella. and this is my point, I think it's dangerous, because I'm yet to be convinced that you will get a client that you can strictly stay with coaching. You know, some of the earlier sessions that I've been to, if we think about where the origins of behavior come from, and that stuff, it's gonna influence what we do, and some of the blocks we have that can't move forward have their origins there, and we might need to understand it, like my client with the control, she didn't really understand how embedded that control thing was for her until recently. And I think that will change her behavior and how she responds to situations in the future. But no, there isn't the formality for coaches, and that's one of my concerns. And I am so glad that I did my counseling training before I did my coaching training. I think, from my own personal perspective, it was one of the wisest things I did, but I didn't realize how wise at the time. 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:01:45
CAROL MCGOWAN For what? My counseling training? The course I did, I did a diploma in life coaching. So that took...probably... 18 months. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:02:00
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, it's a diploma same as you would get in counseling. I have an advanced diploma in counseling, I have a diploma of life coaching, and I also have a Masters of Business Coaching. 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:02:30
CAROL MCGOWAN Okay, this is the distinction I would make from my own experience. When I took my counseling training it taught me what I needed to do, the coaching taught me how. I'm so glad I did both. Because some of the things I didn't get in my counseling training I got from the coaching. And also when I did my Masters, I was the only one in the room who had any form of psychological training, and it made so much difference. 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:03:05
CAROL MCGOWAN No, there wasn't necessarily, but it matched...yes. John? 

01:03:10
JOHN [inaudible] 

01:03:15
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, Sydney Uni has Master of Applied Science Coaching Psychology, with Tony Grant, who's one of the world leaders in coaching. Tony Grant's in everything, you know, he's leading the charge, and Australia is actually in the forefront of developing coaching around the world. Tim Sharp, yes. 

01:03:40
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:03:45
CAROL MCGOWAN We did positive psychology in the course. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN [inaudible] 

01:03:55
CAROL MCGOWAN Yes, strengths based. It's all about strengths based. So, I think we're just about out of time. Has anyone got any questions or comments they want to make? Well, thank you for participating, and staying engaged, I really appreciate that. and enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you.
