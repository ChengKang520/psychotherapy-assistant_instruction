Australian Aboriginal "SORRY BUSINESS" and culturally appropriate counselling AUTHORS: Robina Otrupcek, Maureen Sulter and Beryl Dowd 

00:00:35
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now, back to. Right, now the Gamilaraay elders have helped me put together suggestions to ah… to assist in interaction between health workers and their indigenous clients by acknowledging their culture and history. Ah… now this was put together really, this is a, this presentation is a basis of a workshop that I have been doing for non-indigenous health workers to help them engage better with their indigenous clients. Now I apologize, I'm not indigenous um… I'm from Scottish heritage but my granddaughter is Gamilaraay and I've been involved in the local community for a long time and ah… because of my interest in wanting to know more I'm here. That one. There, now where am I from? Say that's Gamilaraay country there. That’s and Wiradjuri the biggest two groups in New South Wales. I know there is bigger ones in inland but it's a pretty big group of people and this maps had been put together to display the approximate location of the many Australian aboriginal language groups. And before white settlement aboriginal people used to travel long distances and spoke many languages, but each language group had its own laws and traditional practices. But, however, when we ah… examined parallel work developed by Dr Westerman… Dr Tracy Westerman who is a western Australian aboriginal psychologist, we found very similar suggestions from proved interaction to that… we've done. And the diversity of the people is also demonstrated in their degree of acculturation ah… how they've adapted to our culture. It's a one way thing it seems but ah… the diversity even with the small group can depend on their adaptation. And also the distance from the stereotype that's often portrayed I mean we still have a coin around that has an aboriginal with the spear and headband and ah… a little ah… thing covering him and people… even people from overseas thinks that, that's what aboriginals look at… look like. Um… now some of the people that I've spoken to um… the aboriginal people that I've been working with they say, “Oh Look what are you going on with all this stuff? You know, we're doing okay, you know they've… they've got… they've got jobs, they've got lovely families, the kids are going to school and um… you know what… what… all this bringing up all this passes(ph) sorry business.” So there is a few of those but then um… and I… I don't like being separated out because they sort of feel that it sets on a pattern (inaudible ) is appearing lesser able in some way, but most of them that I talked to accept that acknowledgement of their culture and its part in who they are now is a mark of respect. And I really appreciate that. Oh! Oh go back to… I didn’t introduce myself. I'm Robina and I work at the Brewarrina Aboriginal Medical Service which is sort of North of Bourke and my two co-authors aunty Maureen, aunty Beryl are both Gamilaraay women elders and they've been guiding me now for six to seven years in this work.

Recognizing Intergenerational grief and trauma Why younger aboriginals present symptoms of profound grief and yet don't appear to have had personal contact with the source Recognizing Intergenerational learning Why we need to make into account traditional customs when they haven't been practiced for many generations and yet the automatic behavior response often refers back to these customs 

00:04:25
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now, I want to bring up at this point the concept of hardwiring or inherited behaviors and memories so we can recognize the intergenerational grief and trauma. Now, there has been more work done on this but it's a intrinsic thing that you find you know ah… looking at… the things that they carrying like some of the… I should stand here and then I could see it. Um some of the younger people have demonstrate profound grief and yet they haven't ever been exposed to it and there is some people well I noticed in my granddaughter that's great artist(ph) being brought up in a white non-indigenous family um… the paintings that she used to do as a small child in the soil and the dot paintings that she used paint her bedroom wall and herself (inaudible ) and she never learned that. She never not been exposed to it and it confirmed in my idea that this idea of intergenerational learning and this is why a lot of the young people today um… are finding frustration but they're not really quite sure why and yet they're carrying the grief in the hardwiring. 

00:05:45
Some of the losses that come with white settlement •Loss of family and land connectedness • Interruption of travel routes •Loss of access to trade •Loss of access to marriage partners • Breakdown of elders discipline system • Punishment for using their language and customs • Loss of feeling of usefulness • Loss of self value (this is even before we kidnapped their children) 

00:05:45
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now, I would like to have a look at some of the losses, losses that they've occurred although there is plenty of people don't want to go back there and look at this. I still think it's very useful. I'll look at this one then I don't have to try and turn around. Okay the loss of family and land connectedness. Now that’s terribly important to indigenous people. Their connection to their land and the connection to their family and their people and a lot of that has become… disconnected. The interruption of travel routes and you know they used to be able to you know one particular group would be able to trade and intermarry with one group there and one group there and one group there but not that one, or not that one and they had to travel a large distances in order to trade and in order to find wives and partners but ah… their travel routes, in came the settler right in the middle, put fences around these little property and says, “Hey you can't come on my land, you can't come through, here we don't… what you so,” they lost contact with that. And breakdown of the elder system. This is now redeveloping in some of the… good groups. The elder system discipline in the… in Gamilaraay group in Coonabarabran, the elders they are gaining more respect and getting it from the younger, new young people. Punishment for using their language and customs, they won't allow you to use their language. They won't you allow to pursue their customs for a long time. We didn't have the advantage of a nice treaty in trying to decide who does what, the English people just landed and started shooting. The loss of feeling usefulness, feeling of usefulness. Now in the Happiness Conference they had at Sydney, bit back they concluded that the biggest contribution to happiness was the connectedness with the people around and the feeling of usefulness and suddenly these… well not suddenly gradually these people becoming less and less useful and then in gradually their loss, their loss of self value they're keep on being told they are no good and they're not worth much and yet they're an amazing bunch of people there, I mean most of them can speak several languages or they used to be able to and they have so many skills. They were only just now starting to tap into and its enriching I love to see what these amazing people are like and of course this is even before we kidnapped their children. Now, it's incidental, I guess you would have all heard about the Stolen Generation, but it's interesting to know that even today, aboriginal children are seven times more likely to be taken into care by docs than non-indigenous children, makes us wonder why? You know is that due to high rate of family breakdown in indigenous families or our government services judging problems differently? Now when giving workshops to health care workers I stop at this point and I ask them to answer a quality of life questionnaire. You know I asked them to consider six aspects of their life; health, future security, relationships, standard of life, community connectedness and achievements. Now I ask them to look at that and I ask them to grade for themselves where they stand you know one is they don't… are not satisfied. It is whether they're satisfied with these things not whether that's good you know 'coz I feel he’s not brilliant but I'm very satisfied with that and that so I would grade myself high on hill. So I asked them to do that and they should you know if they're okay they should average at about seven and a half, this is if one is low and ten is very-very good. So I asked them to do that for themselves and they really wonder you know why on earth am I asking them this and then I asked them now of the clients that you see, now grade them what do you… how satisfied do you think they are in our indigenous communities that you see? How satisfied do you think they are, and their face falls and they give them the low grades, it’s not how we think they ought to feel, it’s how you see them as feeling satisfied and then in the third column I asked them to say, now imagine back 300 years perhaps. How do you think they would have scored back then in each of these seven areas? And then they're asked to, to have a look you know the suddenly this big drop and that's when I feel I've got them. They're asked to use their imagination. Now… 

00:10:35
Kinship features • Specialist roles where there was always someone responsible for every component of their lives. • Inability to address some family members eg son-in-law and mother-in-law. • Relationship responsibilities where aunts and uncles may not be actual blood relatives • Grandparents become responsible for rearing children. 

00:10:35
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Kinship features. 

00:10:40
[sil.] 

00:10:45
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now I'll just go through some of the… the little differences that, that I found that are so interesting that does make a little bit of difference to when you're engaging with them. Now most of the communities had specialist roles. Now there was one person that was taking care of the Rivann(ph) other person taking care of the Emous(ph) that was responsible for them. You know the person taking care of the Emous(ph) would be the one to say, “No, don't get, get too many eggs put those back because we want them for next season.” And so they each had very specialist roles and that’s why when you go up to a bunch of people instead of asking them question you often have to say, you know who do I ask to get this information and and oh yes they're be able to tell you, oh yeah ask that, that guy if you want to know about something or another because they don't always… aren't able, able to answer themselves. Now the relationship responsibilities where aunts and uncles may not be actual blood relatives, incidentally I'll mention now that it’s a mark of respect if to an older indigenous person to call them aunt or uncle because there is a feeling of inclusiveness and a feeling of respect. Ah… the relationship responsibilities differ too when the grandparents become responsible for rearing children. In fact they often have more of responsibility than the parent. Ah… and that's why when I was involved in the community as… as (inaudible ) grandmother I was accorded that respect to which I really honored. You see. Ah they're missing… they're missing a page. I updated this thing and I haven't putted in. That's alright. 

00:12:40
More traditions • Avoidance of eye contact as a sign of respect. • The smoking ceremony to cleanse gatherings of unwanted spirits. • Inability to use the name of deceased persons. • Aboriginal Spirituality of connectedness to the land and their families. • Belief that they don't cease to exist when they die. • Their totems, and their connections with them. • The essential nature of their funerals. 

00:12:40
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Traditions that influence attitudes are rated from here because there is a slot missing. The importance is that each aboriginal language group has individual sets of traditions and values. So that when you feel that you got the hang of one group you go in and you… you stand to learn how they work and then you move somewhere else and it’s quite different and you have to virtually start it all over again which is why I… I am from Gamilaraay country and it doesn’t um… I don’t have um… any real idea of what happens at the other places, I can only hear from them what’s been happening in other places. The next thing is the skin groups. At birth a baby is designated a skin group that decides its position in its language group in relationship to the others and ought some amazing um… genetic engineering thing that they have they never intermarry and I… they recorded the skin group from birth and of course the next one the degree of adaptation to cultures of western settlers. Next one is um… the several of the towns that we’ve settled um… that contain several groups. (inaudible ) in New South Wales, a role at the intersection of three language groups and um… a lot of the trouble that they’ve… you might have hear the news about being in dub out was that a lot of the different language groups… groups that come down that say, “Oh well your indigenous you can go over in that in the goodness state over there,” and that they might be put next to somebody that they don’t agree with or that they're not let to talk to. Um… you know we… the… the white settlers just assume they're all the same. But it’s… it's interesting going into town just to see um… I was get my… my parent have a look um… you know what groups are in that town and another interesting thing ah… it was about percentage that I learnt very early. No matter what percentage of their heritage indigenous, their identity depends on their acknowledgment of their heritage and they sense a belonging and it’s very rude to refer to any percentage. Um… my granddaughter that’s perhaps ah… , she proudly says I am Curry(ph). You know she… ah… and of course the reason why that takes precedence is… is that um… the inheritance is going back you know 40,000-60,000 years where as Scottish heritage only goes back you know 10 generations or something like that, they can see why it has precedence. And then the last thing was in the inherited hard style that can’t be explained. That’s really interesting because my… um… my granddaughter’s ah… loves drawing these dobs and loves art that she hasn’t learnt and another thing that inherited that style is um… the paintings that you see of animals, have you ever notice that they aren’t hopping along like the kangaroos, they’re damn flat and you can see their in sides. You know in some groups it’s to be um... paint um… live animals so it’s detracting from the capacity to catch them and so they painted um… lying down and you can see their inside because they are ready for cooking. Now… back to the one that is here. Um… some more traditions; avoidance of eye contact is a sign of respect. Now ah… and most people that I meet its okay you know and I sighted them in a counseling situation that you know I’m sorry for it looks like I’m steering but um… that’s my sign of respect to give you attention um… sometimes ah… they’re okay with it, “Oh yeah… that’s okay it’s okay,” but sometimes I read at so much but then I prefer to um… not look so whatever was done is, is I put chair side to side and there is a window I open with some grass out, so that they can dwell on that look outside just in case it’s a big problem with them and the smoking ceremony is interesting to cleanse gatherings of unwanted spirits. Um… you would have seen that um… at the opening of parliament somebody here said sort of in the New Zealand Television the opening of Australian parliament last week, they had a smoking ceremony and um… it cleanses the… the… ah… atmosphere of unwanted spirits shoots them away. Another tradition is the inability to use the name of deceased persons that’s for year they can’t use that name. Because it’s um… they think its bringing that person back and not allowing it to pass on. It’s ah… ah… say that they somebody with the same name has to assume another name for a year. Ah… and of course in some communities they’ve… they ignore it but in many communities it’s very important. And the idea of this presentation is to just to be, for people to be aware of some of other things that maybe important. And the belief that they don’t cease to exist when they die and um… there is a lot of indigenous um… populations that this is similar to um… and they ah… they are still there and they can guide you. Um… the ah… I too had spoke about the aboriginal spirituality of connectedness to the land and their families. My granddaughter had to do a project for school and families and so I helped to do it and explain through it that um… families meant something slightly different to her than it might to the other kids in the class. And the totems and their connections with them um… Gamilaraay totem is a yellow belly fish and um… they… it swims down the Castlereagh River and it gets down to the (inaudible ) areas further down and I… delight in that because I can catch them and eat them when I like. And the next is the essential nature of their funerals. Um… you know if there is a funeral everything is stopped and they travel to give respect to the rest to the whole family by attending that funeral. Um… there is a wonderful funeral in… in (inaudible ) with a… a lady that was the aboriginal (inaudible school and the whole town stop still and all the (inaudible ) students lined the roads to give her respect, I thought that was just wonderful.

Engagement Hints • Need to engage with a person or group, show respect. Use another excuse to approach whoever you want to see before barging in. • Ask “Who your mob”, “Where you from” and “What is your family name”. Many will know who they belong to, and be pleased at your interest. Volunteer your background and why you are here. • Watch for their ease of eye contact and if possible arrange chairs side by side to avoid this and have them facing towards a window, or outside facing grass or trees. • If there is a group, it works well to be in a circle so that each member can watch what’s going on without needing direct eye contact. 

00:19:15
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now. I go to the engagement hints. I made this list, 10 items of a little hints for people um… coming into um… give them some help to… to engage. Now first one is you need to engage with a person or group and show respect you can’t know, you… you can use another excuse to approach whoever you want to see before you barge in and I think that was mentioned yesterday in the pacifica(ph) people that you barging in doesn’t get you anyway, um… a gentle approach talking about something else and showing respect first. And of course we do it too you know we ask about the weather first. Next one um… asking who your mob is ah… and where you are from. Now um… the rules for counseling change a little bit when you are working with the indigenous people because you know… you know never go beyond your boundaries, never talk about yourself, but that doesn’t work, just the same as Maslow's hierarchy of needs doesn’t work with the aboriginal people. You know they say… you know the needs (inaudible ) you know food that’s important, until you get food you can’t look back sit self-actualization. Now back to film. So when you’re asking them you know where are you from I am lucky because I can say to them you know I’ve got a Gamilaraay granddaughter um… you know and I say you know (inaudible ) I am Scottish, my parents are Scottish. You know, “Are from around here?” You know, “Do your family live here?” and so often I am disappointed in that they don’t know who are their families or who are they from all that I want to talk about it. So I just chat on and allow them permission to um… say you… where exactly they are from, because that's very-very important. And watch for their ease of eye contact and if possible arrange chairs side by side to avoid this and have them facing a window or outside facing the grass or the trees. Um… if there is a group, it works well to be in a circle so that each member can watch what’s going on without needing direct eye contact ah… and they… right they um… they have circle sentencing there where um… in many of the towns where group of aboriginality elders make decision on the um... outcome and they'll sit in a circle. 

00:21:40
More hints • Ask “Who do I ask to find out….” Instead of direct questions. Direct questions are confronting and not everyone can speak about everything • If you have an appointment with someone, always check just before to make sure that a family problem doesn’t prevent them from attending • Note that if you talk to a representative of a group, it will filter down. • Allow for gaps in the conversation and don’t interrupt narrative. • It is important to use understanding language such as “not feeling so good” rather than “feeling depressed” 

00:21:45
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Ask, “Who do… Who do I ask to find out?” explain that instead of direct questions. Direct questions are confronting and not everyone can speak about everything. Ah… if you have an appointment with someone always check just before to make sure that a family problem doesn’t prevent them from attending. Because I noticed with my non-indigenous colleagues you know that’s a argument I shouldn’t mind ever turn up you know. I said, “Will you (inaudible ) you know there is something important because their family will take precedence about anything else and it’s very important and yet they… they say that, “Oh but it was so urgent last week,” well adapt to that. Um… and note that if you talk to a representative of a group, it will filter down. um… because they’re very good and very well connected and allows for gaps in the conversation and don’t interrupt narrative, they’re very good at narrative. Ah… if you can… if you get their trust um… they usually happy to talk. And use um… understandable language um… such as, “not feeling so good” rather than ”feeling depressed” nothing that’s ah… a good idea in any counseling of any sort. And um… not that feeling not feeling so good and pointed it to your stomach may will refer to a feeling of the depletion of the spirit. So that they sense um… in the stomach that… that… what they feel in their stomach is ah… a lack spirit and they are not aware, they just feel that that’s bad down there and often you… it’s important to ignite that spirit again to get them to feel connected again it to build that spirit up. And… and of course you know if some of them, you know if they got a ah… say that they are not good in there the doctors who give them some antacids and um… or well have a desire to eat to fill that gap up. But often it’s just depletion the spirit. Therefore working with aboriginal communities it’s important to obtain cultural supervision. I'm so delighted to hear a lot of it here because it's very rarely referred to in Australia, but I get it from um… local elders in Coonabarabran and from the um… judicial system in Walgett and… and I go and talk to them and um… so I look I was doing this, “Is this okay?” You know, “What do you think I should do?” (inaudible ) says, “Ah… don’t know you’ve brought people don’t know why you think like that. You’ve I think (inaudible ) you a lot. Okay. Now what I was doing a course on aboriginal mental health I was alerted to two interesting phenomena when doing aboriginal counseling training. One was called grialling(ph) and one was called vathcing(ph). Oh… ah… that sounds interesting that grialling(ph). You know you go into a new community and that little front you up and say, ”What you’re doing girl? Why are you here? Yeah we don’t know that. Hey no, you are doing it all wrong.” And you… you listen you might have to listen for an hour. But you’re giving them respect by listing for an hour and taking in what their attitude is. And if you could cope with that they’ll be saying, “Ah… you are alright girl. Yeah go ahead.” And the other one was vathcing(ph), you know you if you um… I… I found I went to… it was at (inaudible ) one day driving back I picked up a hitch hiker, young aboriginal man drive him back to Walgett, he is good company. Then two weeks later I was in my office knock… knock… a girl comes in. You… You are the one that go from (inaudible ) that goes back to Walgett in the afternoon?” “Yeah… yeah….” “Ah can we have a lift, no are you okay?” And on the way she says “Oh this Travis.” “Oh Okay”. So I found them in the park and took them back. The third visit they, you know I was driving down the street “Good Day, Good Day.” I was in I felt great. So that’s too some quite um… important things. 

00:25:30
Conclusion Aboriginal languages don’t usually have a word for ‘thank you’. Because they share their resources with each other, they know that if something is given, there is an obligation of reciprocity and they don’t need to express thanks. I thank you for your interest, knowing that if you show respect for the Australian aboriginal culture, your life will be enriched by the experience Winangaya 

00:25:35
ROBINA OTRUPCEK Now um… the aboriginal languages don’t have a word for ‘thank you’, don’t usually have. Because they share their resources with each other, they know that if something is given, there is an obligation of reciprocity and they don’t need to express thanks. At this point I’d like to thank you for your interest, knowing that if you show respect for the Australian aboriginal culture, your life will be greatly enriched by the experience. Winangaya is respect. I’ll go into the flag at the end, you would have all seen the flag I guess. Red for the earth, yellow for the sun, black for the people. It was actually only designed in 1971 just a recent thing and I used it in 72 for the um… Tent Embassy. And that was ah… quite five years before the western(ph) point Tent thing but that’s what they use their flag for and they stand behind it now. Well again thank you very much for your listening and your respect. Thank you.
