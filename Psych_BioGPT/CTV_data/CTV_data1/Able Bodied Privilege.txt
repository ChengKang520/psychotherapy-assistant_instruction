00:00:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi. I'm Lewis Schlosser. I'm a professor of counseling psychology at Seton Hall University. With me today is one of my colleagues, Dr. Pam Foley who is also a professor of counseling psychology at Seton Hall University. One of Dr. Foley's areas of interest and expertise is the issue of ability and ability status and disability. And so we are gonna be talking about ability privilege today. Dr. Foley, thank you so much for agreeing to have this conversation with me. 

00:00:55
PAM FOLEY Oh! Thank you for inviting me. 

00:01:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So... so we're gonna jump right into the question something that you and I have talked about when we agreed to do this, which was... so could you talk about... at first I'd ask you can you talk about able-bodied privilege and you had said about really you know... we'll talk about sort of ability status privilege. So maybe you can talk about ability privilege and also sort of the distinctions between the terms that help the audience sort of understand the little nuance differences. 

00:01:20
PAM FOLEY Yeah. Well, I mean it... it’s not like either term has a clear definition. I think what the field is doing right now is... is getting into trying to come to consensus on... on what this term should be because ability privilege is pretty new um... in terms of being investigated and not really been written about although people have talked about disability. Um... but my concern about the term able-bodied privilege, which a lot of people are starting to use is that it sort of implies that it's all about physical ability. And um... ability really um... extends to cognitive abilities and you know people who have learning disabilities wouldn't necessarily be considered not abled-bodied. So I... I prefer the term ability privilege. 

00:02:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. So... and then the definition would be... so if you think about... 

00:02:10
PAM FOLEY So... 

00:02:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...ability privilege. 

00:02:10
PAM FOLEY Yeah. So again um... there is not a consensus, but the way I see it is that um... ability privilege is an unearned and largely unconscious um... advantage that one has because of abilities that may be mental or... or physical. 

00:02:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm... Hmm... And so think about some concrete examples of the way in which that kind of comes to life... 

00:02:35
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:02:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ... on a day-to-day basis and maybe if you could talk about some other ways... ways in which that manifests much in the way like we first introduce our students the way privilege by giving them Peggy McIntosh’s list. 

00:02:45
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:02:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Here are some weight privileges. 

00:02:45
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:02:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What would be some ways in which this people can identify this? 

00:02:50
PAM FOLEY Hmm... Hmm... Okay. We'll first just start... most people consider that disability has to do with physical abilities, so we'll talk about that first. 

00:03:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. 

00:03:00
PAM FOLEY And um... as somebody who has most of my physical abilities, I can walk up and downstairs and get to places without a problem. I can see where I'm going, I can hear when people um... talk to me, I can hear lectures, um... I'm able to interact with most websites, but people don't think of that as a... as something that has to do with physical ability but sensory abilities like the ability to see um... when you don't have that, a lot of websites are inaccessible to screen readers, which is a whole lot of people with low vision interact with the media. So... so that's um... an example of how people are privileged because of their physi... physical abilities. In terms of mental ability that mostly privileges people who process quickly who um... you know are maybe young girl, people who... who haven't had head injuries that cause them to be distracted um... a way that that may manifest in real life that most people can onnect with is having to wait in a line of a supermarkert where somebody who takes more time to figure out you know what they... they count change or I know that I had the experience of... of not having that privilege when I was in New York and trying to figure out how to use one of those automated ticket machines and it was rush hour and people were furious with me because I was slowing them down. Well they were annoyed because they're privileged to move through that quickly because they were so you know familiar with it was I was thwarting from getting where they needed to go. 

00:04:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, I can do this in two seconds, but... 

00:04:40
PAM FOLEY I can do this two seconds if... if it weren't for you who just are not quick enough. 

00:04:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right and then of course the... the sort of extension is what's wrong with you? What's wrong with her? 

00:04:50
PAM FOLEY What's wrong with you? Right, right. 

00:04:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And that becomes how the person is seen as deviant, different the out, the other. 

00:04:55
PAM FOLEY Absolutely. And... and part of the... part of the the privileges to define what's normal... 

00:04:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm... Hmm... 

00:04:55
PAM FOLEY ...and what's allowable and to the large point. before the Americans with disabilities act, people who really couldn’t keep up with the "norm", we're excluded and marginalized and they still are um... really I mean the... the law hasn't completely solved that. Um... There are a lot of... of laws that have tried to... to get people access to things that that more privilege people have. They were not fully effective and that's part of why we're having this conversation. 

00:05:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. I mean which also reminds me of something you know you had wanted to bring up, which is sort of like something we've talked earlier about disability a couple of times and about sort of helping people understand, what is disability. 

00:05:35
PAM FOLEY Hmm... Hmm... 

00:05:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um... and so maybe I wanna talk a little bit about that. 

00:05:40
PAM FOLEY Yeah and... 

00:05:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It's sort of opportune moment. 

00:05:40
PAM FOLEY Yeah and there are a lot of different definition ways you can define disability. You know you can go legal, you can go conceptual. Um... I think that there I'll talk about two. One is the Americans with disabilities act, which is... is very prominent in terms of defining legal um... what... what disability is from a legal prospective. And um... so that... 

00:06:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You mean what is... what are and are not protected? 

00:06:05
PAM FOLEY Well, who is... who is protected under disability law, um... 

00:06:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. 

00:06:10
PAM FOLEY So... so someone is considered to have a disability um... if they have an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities... 

00:06:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm... Hmm... 

00:06:20
PAM FOLEY What major like our active activities or things like walking, bending, lifting, seeing, hearing, breathing, working um... or if you have a record of such an impairment or if the person is regarded as having an impairment. So all those categories are protected under the law. But you could also think of disability as a social construction in some way in the sense that um... the extent to which someone's disabilities prevent them from um... really having a full life is sometimes because of an interaction with a disabling environment. An example of how somebody might not have access to (inaudible ) EPA. So suppose somebody has low vision. Now they won't... won't be able to see the slides. 

00:07:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Someone who is using PowerPoint for anything. 

00:07:10
PAM FOLEY Right. Somebody who is using PowerPoint. Now we're always taught don't repeat what's on your slides right? 

00:07:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:07:15
PAM FOLEY The problem with that is that if you go totally off topic and assume that your audience is reading your slides, you can lose people who don't have the visual ability to see those slides. 

00:07:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER There's an assumption that everyone can see my slides. 

00:07:25
PAM FOLEY There's an assumption that every one can see, right. There is also an assumption that everyone can hear what you're going to say. I mean AP is pretty good about giving access to interpreters. 

00:07:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:07:35
PAM FOLEY So sign language and that kind of thing. 

00:07:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So this is an example of what you call disabling environment. 

00:07:45
PAM FOLEY Disabling exactly. Yeah, so the... the person really could comprehend what was being talked about but the environment isn't supporting him in that. 

00:07:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. It's sort of like a... it's like the delivery system that's incompatible with their skills... with... 

00:07:55
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:07:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...what their body is... 

00:07:55
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:07:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...what their body is able to do at that moment. 

00:08:00
PAM FOLEY Yeah and most people are... are familiar with the things in disabling environments like you know or they're curb cuts, so wheelchairs can get across streets, um... or they're talking walk signs. Um... Some... some cities have them. 

00:08:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:08:15
PAM FOLEY But some... some don't. So um... and interestingly you know the disability community is some, what had odd with each other, there is just a little bit of trivia, but curb cuts are excellent for people in wheelchairs, not so good for people who have low vision and are trying to find their way with canes because they lose their guidance system. There is a feeling along the curb. 

00:08:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Obviously(ph), when the ground drops out. 

00:08:35
PAM FOLEY Yeah. So um... so what they've actually done in negotiating that is to put the curb cut a little bit off um... so but then you know somebody in a wheelchair doesn't wanna be put into traffic, they wanna be put across into the crosswalk so... 

00:08:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:08:50
PAM FOLEY So interestingly there is not just one answer for everybody in how you... how you resolve some of these problems. 

00:08:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um... Very interesting. Um... I wanna switch gear a little bit and sort of go to ah... if you could talk a little bit about how you personally became interested in the concept of ability privilege, disability... 

00:09:05
PAM FOLEY Hmm... Hmm... 

00:09:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um... If you could talk a little bit about that like from where your interest came. 

00:09:15
PAM FOLEY Well, um... I started getting interested in this in my former life, which was in corporate America and they... when the Americans with disabilities act first came out in 1990, um... I was... was given the opportunity to create a workshop for the employees there to help them understand the act and... and what the company was responsible for in... in reaction to it and to do some kind of education about things that people with disabilities actually could do in the workplace if they had appropriate accommodations. 

00:09:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So you're doing psycho education before you became a psychologist? 

00:09:45
PAM FOLEY Yeah. Hmm... Hmm... Yep and that's kind of how I got interested in being a psychologist as I did at least a few things in the workplace first. Um... And then later on um... I supervised somebody who had multiple sclerosis and... and sort of I saw his challenges in ways in which I was privileged and I could do things that he couldn't do. I could you know get into places he couldn't get into. I could... 

00:10:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Supervised as a psychologist or still a corporate... back in corporate America? 

00:10:10
PAM FOLEY Supervised as a... as a manager, a corporate manager, Yeah. I also worked very closely with someone who had Crohn's disease, which is you know... autoimmune disease that could cause people to when they have flare-ups to you know have to use the restroom more frequently. Um... so just to see the kind of challenges that that person had in going out with friends for an evening you know and... and things that you just take for granted. 

00:10:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I don't need to always know where the bathroom is. 

00:10:40
PAM FOLEY You don’t always... right. You don't, in particular know but... 

00:10:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, right exactly. 

00:10:45
PAM FOLEY But I do, so... 

00:10:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. So as an example of the way the privileged manifests for that person who has Crohn's disease, part of his preparation or her preparation would be... 

00:10:50
PAM FOLEY Hmm... Hmm... 

00:10:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I need to know. 

00:10:55
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:10:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I need to know these things so I can... 

00:10:55
PAM FOLEY Yep. 

00:10:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...manage my going on. 

00:10:55
PAM FOLEY Hmm... Hmm... Yes. Hmm... Hmm... 

00:10:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So there was these early personal experiences in corporate America. Were there any... were there any experiences that in Grad school or beyond further... further that along? 

00:11:05
PAM FOLEY Well, yeah I mean there were a couple of um... key incidents that that really sort of solidified my resolve to continue looking into this and I'm talking about it and... and starting to write about it. 

00:11:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. 

00:11:20
PAM FOLEY Um... but you know two that that come to mind. The first one is I was at a big meeting um... again at a conference and um... the speaker was talking about contributions that people had made to this organization over the year and I said anybody who has been involved in a committee, please stand and be recognized. At that point, someone in a wheelchair pulled out and started to leave the room. And that was a really dramatic event for everybody that was there and... and um... of course the speaker immediately saw her... her and apologized, but um... and... and actually to her credit um... she started saying stand or otherwise be recognized. Um... so that's a change that's happened in this organization as a result of that but that... that really hit me you know as... 

00:12:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Something as simple as... 

00:12:10
PAM FOLEY Something as... 

00:12:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER To... to someone who can't stand. 

00:12:15
PAM FOLEY Yeah. Um... Another thing was... was um... a woman explaining how a group of her friends had... had gone out to dinner the night before and um... invited her but had neglected to check out whether the restaurant was accessible. She was in a wheelchair and she couldn’t go. And so she felt excluded from this special dinner, um... and... because she literally was excluded from this special dinner and... and she was very hurt by that and that really touched me in terms of um... you know my own privilege and really start me thinking more about what that meant. 

00:12:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm... Hmm... So those are a variety of different experiences then. Um... So we can shift a little bit from how you got interested in it and then thinking about um... how can we ask people who train mental professionals work with... with the students and early care professionals or even advanced professionals who don't have experience with the... they sort of become aware of when they do have, when they enjoy... 

00:13:15
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:13:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...ability privilege and sort of... and of course then and the flipside to be... and to help them acknowledge and sort of have empathy for folks who don't... 

00:13:20
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:13:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...who don't enjoy those privileges. 

00:13:25
PAM FOLEY Um... I mean obviously education is huge. These most privileges are unconscious and so letting people know what it's like for somebody in the other side, um... what people can’t take for granted and exercises like putting people in a wheelchair for a few hours and having them tried and negotiate the environment, do it with the blindfold, do it with your ears plugged up so that you understand what it's like to have and that's a physical disability. You know it's harder to dissimulate some of the other disabilities but um... 

00:14:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. I think I have an activity from my psychopathology class where I have a student talk to another student and then have one other student have a talk in one of their person... one of the person's ears, it's sort of tried all to come close to what it might be like to have schizophrenia... 

00:14:15
PAM FOLEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER To hear voices and... 

00:14:15
PAM FOLEY Hmm... hmm... Yeah. 

00:14:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...to try to have a conversation with someone. 

00:14:20
PAM FOLEY And we did exercises when... I mean you know that that our doctoral students used to rotate through the disability support services office. And so we had exercises ah... in which people had to decode complicated symbols to create that... that sense of confusion and frustration that somebody with a learning disability might have or you know they had to... to read letters that were printed backwards. I mean it doesn't get at it exactly, but it does build a little of empathy. 

00:14:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. For that... for like what would it be like to be really frustrated and not be able to... 

00:14:55
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:14:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER ...to do it, maybe if you can get in touch with that, then you can have a sense of what it might be like... 

00:15:00
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:15:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER For so many might be working with either student or client in a setting. 

00:15:05
PAM FOLEY Yeah, and, and being aware of privilege is part of it and then working to sort of level the playing field with regard to privileges is an important step as well and you know, in terms or awareness, I have noticed that some forms of media are trying to include people with disabilities you know, see the comics have people with disabilities occasionally where some TV shows will include a character with the disability so that the people start to really think of people with disabilities as people. I mean, that's why we have person first to language you, you say a person with a disability rather than a disabled person and that can seem like a you know, sort of trivial thing. But, but cognitively it does make a difference. 

00:15:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER um… yeah. 

00:15:45
PAM FOLEY So it’s not just political correctness. It does really help you think of, of people as having you know, people have personalities, they have different interests, they have more than just their disabilities. 

00:15:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, they are person with something, not the thing. 

00:16:00
PAM FOLEY Not the thing, yeah. 

00:16:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right and maybe one of things I, I neglected to ask you about previously was if you could talk a bit about the role of visibility with regard to abilities status privilege as you know… 

00:16:10
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:16:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …like some aspects of privilege white privilege, male privilege people look at you and they could be wrong in certain aspects(ph), but by large they can probably put you in the right category. 

00:16:25
PAM FOLEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:16:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But they probably can’t look at you for a lot of things and, and that's perhaps again a few in a wheelchair, but there may be a number of abilities that assists for which think that you have no idea. 

00:16:35
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:16:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And if you comment on maybe the dynamic and have a, hot it impacts privilege. 

00:16:40
PAM FOLEY That's really important and I think that people are willing to go the extra mile for someone who is in a wheelchair, ah… but not for somebody who may have an equally disabling condition like heart condition, maybe they can't walk too far, they get out of breath, maybe they, maybe they have what we talk about Crohn's disease, maybe they need a preferential placement of their office in the workplace and that tends to, butt(ph) up against people who have ability privilege and getting dignity(ph) when their privilege is somehow infringed, because they don't believe that the person really needs the accommodation. 

00:17:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Sort of like why is that person who is not on a wheelchair parking in a handicapped space. 

00:17:20
PAM FOLEY Yeah, exactly, exactly and, and even people with disabilities may inappropriately go after somebody who doesn't look like they have a disability who is parking in a handicap's space when maybe this person really does have an inability to walk for more than short distances without becoming tremendously out of breath or you know there could be, there could be repined disorder, there could be many reasons why you wouldn't see the disability, but the person could legitimately need an accommodation. 

00:17:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So there is that that issue of the legitimacy testing that’s present there too. 

00:17:55
PAM FOLEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER As it is in other aspects of privilege and identity. 

00:17:55
PAM FOLEY Well, yeah and there, I mean there is also you know, the misconception that accommodations are giving somebody an unfair advantage. 

00:18:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm… hmm… 

00:18:05
PAM FOLEY Um… you know people the law says that people have to be hired for jobs that they are otherwise qualified to do and then there have to be appropriate accommodations there have to be reasonable accommodations. That’s the other thing, they are not asking for unreasonable things that are gonna be so expensive that they are gonna sink the company. So they consider the, the… you know, whether that the accommodation is actually possible. 

00:18:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I'm sure lawyers argue about the meaning of the word reasonable. 

00:18:30
PAM FOLEY oh yeah. That's what keep lawyers in business, right but… 

00:18:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, but from our perspective in psychology helping our, helping clients understand what they are entitled to in terms of their protection under the ADA. 

00:18:45
PAM FOLEY Absolutely. Under the ADA in many other laws, you know there is five or four, there are quite a few laws and the APA has a website I, they can pose(ph) website actually it’s a good place to look for that, he has a list of all the different laws that that impact disability. 

00:19:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It’s an excellent resource. 

00:19:05
PAM FOLEY Yeah, yeah. 

00:19:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So let's, we’ve talked a bit about what is ability privilege and a little about where kind of it, your interest came from and then we can really talk about and we started to talk about this and go back to, what we can, what can we about it? 

00:19:15
PAM FOLEY Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So I’m wondering what your thoughts are about ah… what, what can be done in terms of dismantling ah… ability privilege and it actually falls in that area. 

00:19:30
PAM FOLEY Yeah, yeah well I mean, as I said before, I think education and advocacy are huge, because people don't really realize they have this privilege and there is a tendency for humans to want to be fair, I mean there has been research that shows that people buy enlarge want things to, to be equitable. So if they understand really that they have a privilege that’s not appropriate and that there are people that are being excluded not that there aren’t people who are gonna want to take advantage anyway and don't care, but that exists in society. 

00:20:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yeah. 

00:20:05
PAM FOLEY But, but if there is some advocacy toward educating, helping people build empathy including stories of people with disabilities that that humanize people with disabilities again make them more than just their disability. Uh… the other thing that I think is really important to think about is universal design and so, so rather that thinking, oh we’re gonna do something to help this person as a special accommodation who has the disability, design things in ways that that they help everybody. So, so a couple of examples ah… a story that I think it illustrates this really well is there was a huge snow storm and the custodian is outside shoveling the steps to get into a school and a little boy and all the children are waiting outside, because they can’t get into the school so little boy in a wheelchair comes up and he says, “Excuse me sir, could you shovel the ramp, you know so I can get into?” And the custodian says, “Well kid, you know I got all these other kids that that need to get in I'm gonna shovel the steps first.” And the little boy says, “But if you shovel the ramp, we could all get in.” And, and so I mean that's universal design. 

00:21:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Cute story. 

00:21:15
PAM FOLEY Everybody can, can take advantage of that. Vibrating cell phones and flashing alerts were actually designed how people with disabilities who couldn't hear, but now we all use them you know I mean our phones are on vibrate. So that’s something that, that actually we’ve benefited from, they came from originally trying to help the people in disability communities. So there are a lot of examples about that people who’ve written about universal designs just gonna get think about that um… rather than thinking of people with disabilities as an exception that needed to, they need to have special accommodations, do things that that help all of us. 

00:21:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, instead of well, how do I modify what we've got here to help this person and sort of… 

00:21:55
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:21:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …it's that like you know, how can I design an environment that’s the same, I can design an environment that will work. 

00:22:00
PAM FOLEY Exactly and an environment that’s not disabling it’s a good way of looking at it and it's not, it's not causing a problem for anybody else, it's just really making an environment that everyone can participate in. 

00:22:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER As you think about the fact that we're hoping that this video will be watched by lots of trainees who are going in graduate programs. Who would you want them to, to walk away with like you know, in terms of, you know a lot of times when we talk I think, oh I said a lot of things my students, I hope if I just remember one or two things what, what might be some of the take home as a, take home points are sort of main things you’d really want people to, to be sort of thoughtful about with regard to ability privilege. 

00:22:40
PAM FOLEY Hmm… hmm… Well, you may, you know one thing that that is important for people to really think about is you know, we are really all temporarily abled, you know people sort of have this misperception that this does have anything to do with me, I don't have any disabilities. Well, if we live long enough, we all will ah… and so, you know maybe that would help us create a little bit of empathy. Um… for people to start to think about their own privilege to reflect on it, you know what are the things that that I am able to do that maybe other people can't, again ability privilege like any other privilege is often unconscious. So if you can just start a little bit of cognitive dissonance and how the people think, you know just start that internal conversation but then maybe talk about other people and then if it stimulates them to go out and learn about people with disabilities, what are the types of disabilities that people have and bring to the workplace, because more and more people are entering college and entering the workplace who have disabilities, people are coming home from combat with head injuries and physical disabilities so those people will be encountering counselors and counseling psychologists they will be looking for career counseling, ah… they’ll probably be looking for personal counseling and accommodating how, how do you accommodate disability, but how would you just having a disability. If you require a disability in, in later life it's a different process of adjustment. This you probably know that that if you’re born with it um… so. 

00:24:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Or even if you require maybe in your early 20s it might be different than… 

00:24:20
PAM FOLEY Hmm… hmm… Right. 

00:24:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …if I am 60 or 70 and… 

00:24:20
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:24:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …it's a result more, see more if it’s a result of (inaudible ) the natural aging process… 

00:24:26
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:24:26
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …versus maybe a combat, you know an accident related acquisition. 

00:24:30
PAM FOLEY Yeah, absolutely and, and if you require after you’ve already experienced ability, ability privilege that’s a more difficult adjustment and it tends to maybe cause a reaction of depression or um… discouragement or um… you know, that's harder. 

00:24:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I guess what I, what I could once do. 

00:24:45
PAM FOLEY I’ve had that privilege, this was taken away, yeah. 

00:24:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And I can no longer do this and… 

00:24:50
PAM FOLEY Yeah, yeah so you know, I can't do anything. You know, it goes back to the old assumptions that people we have assumptions about people with disabilities and then if we really come one of people with disabilities those assumptions don’t go away, you know so, so that education is important for somebody who, who acquires a disability after, you know after their early years as well. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Alright, um… the question I… I'd like to end with is you know, is there anything that you really would have like to talk about that you didn't there is a question you wanted me to ask you and I didn't something that sort of remains left unsaid. 

00:25:25
PAM FOLEY You know, I am sure there are a million things that remain left unsaid that I will remember after I leave, but you know I, I just think that it's really important for people to recognize that people with disabilities will be part of our everyday lives more and more and to recognize that as counselors and psychologists we will meet people with disabilities and it's really important for us to understand not only what the signature of their experience, but how we have been privileged and… and you know, the other thing that that I think we didn't talk about is how ability privilege intersects with other privileges and that that’s also important, because you know, using myself as an example um… probably the, the most salient privileges have been that I’m white and that I relatively high as he has and both of those um… will tend to make it less likely that I have a disability to start out with for example, my mother got good prenatal care you know, I always had well baby visits when I was an infant I have always had good medical care uh… I don't live in a neighborhood where I am likely to encounter violent crime as much I’m and was sort of sheltered from there um… and so the other thing is that if I should have a disability I would be more likely to be able to afford appropriate medical care and to maybe legal, legal help if I need to advocate from myself. Um… heterosexual privilege is also another thing that can intersect with this, umm… because my partner is a heterosexual I know that my partner would be able participate in medical care that I have. That's not the case for somebody who may be part of a gay marriage. 

00:27:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, there is no question hat John will be able to make medical decisions on your behalf… 

00:27:25
PAM FOLEY Absolutely. 

00:27:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …if you were incapacitated. 

00:27:30
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:27:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER No one will question him. 

00:27:30
PAM FOLEY No one will question whether he can visit me in the hospital, yeah nobody now that this, this is not as likely because I'm a female, but you know if I were male and I had all the other privileges and, and was gay, there is the assumption that I am gonna have transmit aids to someone that's another, that's another issue about it you know, the assumed disability. 

00:27:50
PAM FOLEY And the sort of layers that are on top of that… 

00:27:55
PAM FOLEY Lots of layers. 

00:27:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …like oh well you’re, you’re a gay man then… 

00:27:55
PAM FOLEY Right. 

00:27:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …yeah, this is what you must be worried about or must have had. 

00:28:00
PAM FOLEY Absolutely, yeah. So you know, it’s very complicated there are a lot of different identities that that intersect in privileges, that intersect and so it's, it's there is a lot to learn and so, but you know, there, there will be people among us who, who will need empathy uh… not sympathy that's the other thing you know, it's really inappropriate to describe people with disabilities as you know heroic, or you know that that's really in a way disrespectful, um… because that is based on our own assumption that this is a horrible-horrible thing and so. 

00:28:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I’m, I’m really glad that I asked you that question. 

00:28:40
PAM FOLEY Yeah. 

00:28:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because I completely forgot to ask you about the way the identities intersect and that’s such a huge issues that impacts all aspects of privileges you know. 

00:28:45
PAM FOLEY Yeah.
