CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AS A VEHICLE FOR PROMOTING BETTER DECISIONS 

00:00:25
MICHAEL YAPKO, PHD 

00:00:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Thanks for volunteering to do. First question I have for you is, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 

00:00:45
KANTINA It's about aging, it's about being alone or not, and it's about finding the best decision that would benefit much elder than me because they lived always overlooking when I divorced. And I did very well alone, I see them, they come to see me. But once you get at 80, you start to think differently. 

00:01:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Differently how. 

00:01:30
KANTINA Differently because you might get sick which I haven't been till now, you might want or choose to have help with the close this older children, but I don't know how to decide that. 

00:01:50
MICHAEL YAPKO So you're really trying to decide now how you want to redefine your relationship with your children. 

00:02:00
KANTINA Not so much of relationship. The relationship is fine. 

00:02:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah, but, I mean, in terms of their help. 

00:02:05
KANTINA The closeness. 

00:02:10
MICHAEL YAPKO The closeness. 

00:02:10
KANTINA Yes. 

00:02:10
MICHAEL YAPKO That's really what I mean. Okay. So physical closeness, being around to help you, and support you or… 

00:02:20
KANTINA Not that they won't help, but maybe I'll need help that I don't know. And I hope not to. 

00:02:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. So what exactly are you trying to decide then. 

00:02:35
KANTINA Location wise. I live in ocean side not far from you, and my children live in Europe, but they might come over they brought places in Florida. So but my ex-husband is still alive and they hold with around him because it's financial situations the… there is a big in heritage and they want that. Inheritance. 

00:03:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Inheritance okay. 

00:03:10
KANTINA So they want that and that's fine. 

00:03:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:03:15
KANTINA But we have a good connection. I sometimes go to Florida, but it's not I really won't need I call for to stay with them, but age is teaching me differently, so I don't know how to feel that, I have to know that. 

00:03:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, people having hard time hearing. 

00:03:45
KANTINA Where is this speaker? 

00:03:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Our sound tech. Do you need her to repeat some of the key things? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:04:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Can you pump up the volume on her. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN Can you make her to speak a little louder, (inaudible). 

00:04:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And… and if you move the microphone up a little bit… Can you move it just a little bit further up your dress here, a little higher, a little closer to your mouth? There you go. Great. May that will make. So if you could speak a little more loudly and kind of say again, so everybody can follow what you're… what you're trying to decide and what the situation is. 

00:04:25
KANTINA I wish to know maybe it who (inaudible). If I want if it will be better for the children and for me to be closer together basically. 

00:04:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. All right. How would you know what's better for you or what's better for your kids? 

00:04:50
KANTINA I don't know the future. And I'm really trying to feel out. 

00:04:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And so to this point, how have you been going about thinking about this or trying to make a decision about this? 

00:05:05
KANTINA I've never done anything about it because it comes with, you know, age that I started to think about it. 

00:05:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. And so as you've started to think about it, how have you been moving yourself in the direction of making a decision one way or the other about what you wanna do? 

00:05:30
KANTINA I wouldn't moved because I'm stuck. 

00:05:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Okay. So your kids are living where now? 

00:05:35
KANTINA Back in Europe, but they really they might, I don't know moved to… They come once or twice a year to Florida and get (inaudible) in the houses. 

00:05:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, they have… they have property in Florida. 

00:05:50
KANTINA Yeah. 

00:05:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And when they come over is that when you go see them. 

00:05:55
KANTINA Then I go… I go when my husband isn't home, nobody bothers me, but he seems not to be comfortable about it, so I avoid it. 

00:06:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Have you talked to your kids about what your concerns are? 

00:06:15
KANTINA I do not want to be a burden on them. It's not… it's not… they are busy with their. 

00:06:20
MICHAEL YAPKO I think by talking about that, it's gonna burden them? 

00:06:25
KANTINA Yes, because… 

00:06:25
MICHAEL YAPKO How do you know that? 

00:06:30
KANTINA My younger son will go in stress, under stress. My older son get detached, the kind of… I know, they never try the emotional decisions that how they are. So I know it burdens them, I don't talk about it. 

00:06:50
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:06:50
KANTINA They don't involve with emotions that's basically the problem. 

00:06:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Do they have any idea that you're concerned about your health and your concerned about. 

00:07:00
KANTINA I'm not certain about my health… 

00:07:00
MICHAEL YAPKO You're saying in the future. 

00:07:05
KANTINA In the future. 

00:07:05
MICHAEL YAPKO I understand. 

00:07:05
KANTINA Logical. 

00:07:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Yeah. Do they know that you're concerned about? 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:15
KANTINA They see me as very strong, very healthy, stronger than them. 

00:07:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Stronger than them. 

00:07:25
KANTINA That's how they see me. 

00:07:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. 

00:07:25
KANTINA And that's fine. 

00:07:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Have you had other times in your life ever had to make a similar kind of a decision? 

00:07:40
KANTINA Yes. 

00:07:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Something where you were really uncertain about which way to go? 

00:07:45
KANTINA Yes and no, I was certain, I wanted to quit Europe, but I wasn't certain about what would happen 

00:07:55
MICHAEL YAPKO If you left Europe and came here? 

00:08:00
KANTINA Yeah. 

00:08:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And so when you came here, and you were uncertain about it, you came anyway. 

00:08:05
KANTINA Yes. 

00:08:10
MICHAEL YAPKO And somehow made it work for yourself? 

00:08:10
KANTINA Yes. I'm very happy that's why I'm so unsure because I might be (inaudible) my life and might be aware of (inaudible). So… 

00:08:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Okay. Have you had any experience with hypnosis before? 

00:08:30
KANTINA Yes. 

00:08:30
MICHAEL YAPKO You have? Can you tell me just a little bit about that? 

00:08:40
KANTINA I come out very relaxed and… nothing… not specific happen immediately but to Tom, it seems to bring my focus to the point where it was best for me. 

00:09:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay, okay. Are you ready to do this now? 

00:09:10
KANTINA Yes. 

00:09:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. Arrange yourself then and whatever position's comfortable for you. All right. Are you comfortable? 

00:09:20
KANTINA Yes, thank you. 

00:09:25
MICHAEL YAPKO And then you can begin by taking in a few deep relaxing breaths. That's right. Arrange yourself in whatever way you need to at any point along the way. It's important to know you can always make adjustments to make yourself more comfortable as we go. Now I don't know just what your previous experiences were like in any great detail. It's nice to know that you could focus, it's good to know that you are able to relax, and hold on to that relaxation even when you came out after a while. And here in this rather unique situation, you have an opportunity to start to explore in a different way, the quality of your own thoughts, the quality of your perceptions. 

00:10:55
[sil.] 

00:11:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And given how this whole interaction revolves around the choices that you make, all the decisions that people make that you make often without even realizing. It was a very conscious and deliberate decision to volunteer to be here with me. But I really don't know how much thought, how much deliberateness there is to a lifetime of decisions sitting in a class as a young girl deciding to raise your hand to ask a question from the teacher, deciding who to play with, deciding whether to talk to the child in the next seat, whose house to go to when it's time to play. All the decisions even in childhood that begin to shape your understandings of other people, how other people look at things, how other people feel about things. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And whether it's choosing a meal in a restaurant or what clothes to wear today or whether to make an adjustment and how you're setting. 

00:13:40
[sil.] 

00:13:45
MICHAEL YAPKO There are countless decisions to be made every day. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
MICHAEL YAPKO And you've learned something about your style of making decisions over the course of a lifetime, which decisions were quite spontaneous, decisions that you gave a lot of thought to. And here you are now in this increasingly comfortable position. 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:50
MICHAEL YAPKO To start to consider again new decisions, new thing to consider. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Sometimes people will ask me questions that are really intriguing questions because the answer isn't immediately clear. 

00:15:35
[sil.] 

00:15:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Sometimes someone will ask really basic question like, "Michael, what do you think the best car to buy?" I wonder how you'd answer a question like that. But my answer is to ask the question best for what? Best for looks? Best for comfort? Best for gas mileage? Best for safety? Best for looking cool, driving down the street? Best for what? 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And I could easily ask you best for what? 

00:17:00
KANTINA Comfort. 

00:17:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Comfort. But, of course, I'm talking about in the decision-making of your own future. How many different ways are there to decide? How you wanna really live well? How you want to move into the future? What's best for your kids? What's best for you? What's familiar and easy? What's safe? What's driven by a sincere desire to enjoy your life, your well-being, your lifestyle? And what's best in fear? And, you know, as well as I do. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
MICHAEL YAPKO How easily someone's mood can influence the quality f their decisions? People who are so optimistic that they take senseless risks, people who are so fearful that they're overly cautious. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
MICHAEL YAPKO And out of all the ways there are to make a decision county. Out of all the different ways there are to think about the unknown, the unpredictable. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:15
MICHAEL YAPKO Now you have made so really big decisions before the uncertainty of leaving Europe and coming to America, and you chose a pretty nice place to live. Good decision. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And could you really have predicted the details of your everyday life as it is, the people that you would meet and become friends with, the sunsets from ocean side that are so often prettier than anything you could have imagined, and it's that looking forward the unknown invites possibilities. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:21:55
MICHAEL YAPKO And out of all the ways there are to decide things. Now you being a resident of San Diego County, can I assume that you've been to the zoo at sometime? You have haven't you? 

00:22:15
KANTINA Yes. 

00:22:20
MICHAEL YAPKO And I don't know if you know this but many years ago, I was invited to work with the elephants on a breeding project and when they called me, I said, "I'm a psychologist, you really must have a wrong number." And they said, "No, we want to use your insights to understand something about how our lead keeper works so well around the elephant's." Now you might wonder why I'm talking about elephants right now, perhaps had an even deeper level you already know. But they brought me into the elephant enclosure, and I literally got manhandled by the elephants. It was scary, and it was exciting, and I didn't know what was gonna happen. And I certainly wondered what if I get injured, but I also learned something interesting that they'd had this hands-on program since the very beginning of being in the enclosure. And when I asked them if the goal is safety why put people in with the elephants, especially people like me who are untrained? And they simply said because that's just the way it's always been done. 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Now think about that answer, Kantina. "It's just the way it's always been done." 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:15
MICHAEL YAPKO How many different ways are there? That's right, you can go even deeper. To make a decision like that based on tradition, based on emotion. 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Based on concern with someone else might think, based on the outcome that you want. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And that's when it starts to become much clearer to you that when you set aside fear, tradition, reflex, and you think in terms of who you are, and how you do things. Independent, strong willed, willing to take risks, and the decision that becomes increasingly clear now about how you wanna live. It may not be the same decision in 5 years or 10 years, but it can provide a tremendous amount of relief now to know that you can use the blessing of your good health, and the strength of your character, and the power of your ambition, and the sensitivity to grow ever clearer of what's a good decision now and under what conditions making a new decision later might seem desirable. And so I'm curious now, Kantina, I'd like to check in with you. Just what's you're aware of this moment. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
KANTINA I looked over the window of my office and I saw the ocean and that's where I wanna be. And at that time it seem to be five years from now that would be a better time to make a decision and my only decision that I need to pay attention to it's my safety. Because I know comfort I will get it, I'll have it but safety I don't know how to get that. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And looking out the window of your office and reminding yourself that you chose that place for a reason that it's not just an office is it? There's something much more of being there, working there, and much more than just your professional identity or professional home. But isn't that a curious thing as you focus more deeply how there can be the concern about having an office, paying for an office, and then something else takes over ambition, professional identity, desire to have a space that suits you. And you didn't choose it because well, that's just the way it's always been. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You choose it while looking ahead to all that could be possible, by being there. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And if we expand that to all the can be possible living your life, enjoying your life, setting aside the concerns every person has, "Will I be okay?" 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:40
MICHAEL YAPKO And living. Living how you want and where you want. And when I asked about different ways to choose, when you choose from the strengths of your vision of what your life can be, it's a very different choice than if you choose from the fear of what your life might be and with that comes a surprising level of comfort. And comfort is a good thing, really a good thing. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
MICHAEL YAPKO And how you deal with the unknown, the unpredictable. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:05
MICHAEL YAPKO I'm always reminding people, and I bet in your own way you are too that there isn't safety in the world or predictability in the world. The safety is in you, trusting yourself, trusting yourself. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:50
MICHAEL YAPKO You can say that again. 

00:34:55
KANTINA I said welcome to trusting myself. 

00:35:00
MICHAEL YAPKO Welcome to? 

00:35:00
KANTINA Trusting myself. 

00:35:00
MICHAEL YAPKO To trusting yourself. 

00:35:00
KANTINA Trusting my choice, my opinion. And I saw a bridge like that, and it's kind of hard to climb but my perception is that that's far out. So I think well that I've (inaudible) was that I quietly will die where I live. But not now. 

00:35:40
MICHAEL YAPKO But not now. 

00:35:40
KANTINA It seems quite flat out so. So that's gonna (inaudible) welcome. 

00:35:45
MICHAEL YAPKO That's good. Feel comfortable with that? 

00:35:50
KANTINA Yes. 

00:35:55
MICHAEL YAPKO It feels right, doesn't it? 

00:35:55
KANTINA Yes, it does. 

00:35:55
MICHAEL YAPKO You know, that… that point about choosing from a position of strength, it's so different than choosing from fear. 

00:36:05
KANTINA Yes. 

00:36:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And to remind you, you know, the way I hoped it to remind you of times that you've already that, that you can trust that in yourself. 

00:36:20
KANTINA But those times, I was not dealing with old age that was difficult. 

00:36:25
MICHAEL YAPKO And you're not yet now either. 

00:36:30
KANTINA Thank you. 

00:36:30
MICHAEL YAPKO That's farther down the line. 

00:36:30
KANTINA Yeah. It looked like one (inaudible). 

00:36:35
MICHAEL YAPKO And who knows. That's why each day matters and doing the things that you feel good doing. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN And that's what I'm doing, you know. 

00:36:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Okay. I want you lean back and let yourself get absorbed again, get focused again. With this allows you to do each time that you close your eyes and focus there's an invitation, an invitation from you to yourself about inviting yourself into life, the freedom, to do the things that you wanna do, you've heard a million times ages negotiable. There are people who are 80 going on 37, and there are people who are 80 going on 115. And to hear yourself say, "I'm healthy, I like where I live, I like what I'm doing." That's ageless. It's a ageless. And there are sometimes when I'm working with people, they have challenging things that have happened in their past, and I have to remind them you're more than your history. And then sometimes people will tell me their impressive job title, and I have to remind them you're more than your job title. And there are people who define themselves according to their weight, body, and I have to remind them you're more than your body. Well, I think you already know, you're much more than your age. You're all those thing that you've spent a lifetime developing the self-understand, the clarity about what you think is important, the value that you place on relationships, whether it's with clients or friends. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
MICHAEL YAPKO You're much more, much more. That's right a deep breath. Take whatever time you wanna, Kantina, to really let all of these ideas settle in, and the next time that you're at the zoo or the safari park, and you see the elephants and might be an unusually clear reminder… 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:45
MICHAEL YAPKO …that there are a lot of different ways of managing a herd of unruly placoderms. 

00:42:00
[sil.] 

00:42:05
MICHAEL YAPKO And in particular if you take time to notice… 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:15
MICHAEL YAPKO …who the matriarch of the herd is, she's the oldest, and the most powerful, and the wisest, and when she tells the others to get moving, they get moving. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
MICHAEL YAPKO And since you're the matriarch of your own herd… 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:42:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Well, you know the rest. 

00:43:00
KANTINA That feels very good. 

00:43:05
MICHAEL YAPKO It feels good, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what went on for you during that time? 

00:43:15
KANTINA That's symbology of the matriarch of my own herd. 

00:43:20
MICHAEL YAPKO The matriarch of your herd. 

00:43:20
KANTINA It feels me. 

00:43:20
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:43:25
KANTINA It feels who I'm, how I behave, what I do. 

00:43:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:43:30
KANTINA And I never (inaudible) that stone of an impression on having confidence about what is coming. And I see a lot of assumption up that end that every bridge doesn't seem to be so much of an attraction, I don't know why I wanted to cross the bridge. Now, I didn't have to. 

00:44:05
MICHAEL YAPKO You didn't have to. That's good. It's a new quality of decision for you isn't it? 

00:44:10
KANTINA Yes, yes. 

00:44:10
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

00:44:15
KANTINA So now I feel that whatever I will decide it's very strong, it's very clear, and very safe. 

00:44:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Nice. 

00:44:25
KANTINA That's a lot of comfort. 

00:44:30
MICHAEL YAPKO That's great. 

00:44:30
KANTINA Because it was the first time in my life, I was wishy-washy about, but that wasn't clear. 

00:44:35
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:44:35
KANTINA And now I'm clear. 

00:44:40
MICHAEL YAPKO That's correct. 

00:44:40
KANTINA Who I'm and what I'll do. 

00:44:40
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. 

00:44:45
KANTINA Thank you for that comfort. 

00:44:45
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. 

00:44:45
KANTINA And thank you for that image it will stay with me for until I'm 20. 

00:44:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Great. Appreciate that. 

00:44:55
KANTINA Thank you. 

00:44:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Would you be okay about responding to questions from the audience? 

00:45:00
KANTINA Yes. 

00:45:00
MICHAEL YAPKO You don't have to, you know, but are you okay with that? 

00:45:05
KANTINA Oh, yes. 

00:45:05
MICHAEL YAPKO Thank you. We have a few minutes left to talk that if there are any questions for Kantina about her experience or anything, any questions from you about the process of the experience? But certainly nice to hear Kantina say that she's now feels clear about it. 

00:45:25
KANTINA Yes. 

00:45:30
MICHAEL YAPKO Would you use the microphone in that aisle please? So we can… Whoever's listening this can hear your question. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN It was a great demo. I would like to know why did you bring the elephants? 

00:45:50
KANTINA The eleph… I didn't bring them in, he proposed them to me, and I welcomed them because that symbol of the elephants are very grounded, have very long memory, and are very strong. And it seems that… that is a symbol that fits my behavior, my… how I deal with my life. But this is the first time in my life I was kind of feeling not to know what to do. And it feels good. I feeling now, I can stay wherever I'm, nothing will happen to me, I will be safe until death. And it's maybe not a reality for people, but to me I'm very internal, I'm very… always counting on me nothing, nobody else I take advice from because I know I'm ultimately responsible. So when he gave me that symbology, it felt now I can relax, this is confirmation of who I am, so I'm safe until under 20 nothing can happen to me. Symbology in my life has always helped me to any of the… that… that came and symbology gives me a lot of comfort and strength. Thank you.

MICHAEL YAPKO It's nice. Doing hypnosis with people, hypnosis cures nothing, hypnosis cures nothing. What has the potential to be therapeutic or the associations that people make during hypnosis, the new connections that they make that you provided a context for them making. So to make use of a metaphor happens to be a true story about my experience with elephants, can you think of any symbol of power greater than an elephant? The size, the power, and yet I talked about it from the standpoint of we can either talk about the power of elephants or we can talk about the fear-based approach of, you know, what… what if you get injured, what if you get killed? The what if's that drive anxiety, and the problem, of course, isn't that people ask, "What if?" The problem is when they don't answer it, and the question just hangs in the air of "What if this happens, what if I'm not healthy, what if my kids aren't there to take care of me, what if, what if, what if?" And without some ability to answer it and even if the answer is I can't answer that now, but I might be able to answer it in five years. And to be able to create the space for just being now in a strength-based way rather than a fear-based way but, you know, the story was all about bringing me into this program, how can we train trainers, and train keepers, and keep them from getting injured or killed. Safety being the predominant theme and, of course, that safety theme is really what Kanti was dealing with. Okay? Time for one more question. Yeah? If you won't mind go into the microphone.

UNKNOWN Yes, it was very impressive to see how the… the anecdote that came to you fitted her so perfectly even though, you don't know really that much about her, and so it resonated. But I just wondered is the message always whoever is trying to make a decision to do it from a place of strength rather than fear is that the universal message? 

00:50:25
MICHAEL YAPKO No, no. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Because I was thinking about… 

00:50:25
MICHAEL YAPKO Yeah. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN One of my patients who came to me saying, "I don't know whether to stay with my wife or with my the woman I'm having an affair with because they each have good qualities and bad qualities, and so on." And, you know, he left after while having acquired insight because it was his first therapy, but he hadn't made a decision and to say to him you can decide five years down the line that was exactly what he would have wanted to carry in that situation. So, you know, how… 

00:50:55
MICHAEL YAPKO Get the larger point here. 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:51:00
MICHAEL YAPKO How many ways are there to make a decision? So you can make a decision about the future of a marriage based on the potential of this marriage to grow into something meaningful, you can make a decision based on integrity of I made a commitment to this woman, and so I should either be in the marriage or I should be out of the marriage, but I shouldn't be half in and half out as an integrity based thing, the moral decision of what the right thing is to do when you've got two people hanging on your decision-making, you have the tradition of nobody in our families ever gotten divorced, so I don't want to be the first. You have the financial decision. So when there are so many different ways of making a decision, how to make the decision. So when you look at how often people will make a list of pros and cons, the worst decision-making strategy there is you make the list of pros, you make the list of cons, they cancel each other out, and now you're more confused than ever. If I was doing a session with a client you're talking about, I do a session that revolves around integrity. What it means to make a commitment to someone and then violate that for personal convenience. And that's an important way of making a decision. So no, there's no universal of this is the way you do it when somebody needs to make a decision, that the larger thing that I was demonstrating is there are many different ways of making a decision and what's gonna be the most effective way under these conditions with this person for making this kind of a decision. And so it's gonna be different from case to case, client to client, okay? All right. We better stop there. Kanti, thanks so much for volunteering to this. I really appreciate that. 

00:52:50
KANTINA I enjoyed that.
