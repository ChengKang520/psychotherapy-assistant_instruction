MICHELLE FINE  Let me thank my amazing family in this front row, if you haven't seen them, check 'em out. Uhm, David, you're amazing. Uhm, so, uhm, so today, uhm, ah, I wanna present a love letter to the elders. And uhm, and the elders include my dad, who's somewhere, hopefully, chatting with Audrey Lorde, that's my best image. Uhm, my mom, who's 92, who was gonna be here but fell the other night, and uhm, couldn't be here, but is, I think my sister has her, in, in her pocket uhm, and ah, W.E.B. Du Bois, those three are the big ones. Okay, my mom, my dad, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Uhm a, and, and I'm hoping that I, I can speak this love letter to the elders so that we can collectively gather the outrage and the courage to dare to do what we need to do as psychologists and educators in very hard times. I now it's a great year. I know there's Obama, but I also know there's NCLB and I know there are nooses and I know that there's a war and I know that too many people are in prison, and I know that psychology and education are becoming the science that makes all of that possible. (Sniffs) I worry that we're the lubricant that seals the fate of too many children not getting high school degrees because we have colluded in the high stakes testing madness and the mass incarceration madness. But let me say also just an appreciation for the elders who initiated this space. Sam, this is your dream. I thank you. Uhm, Sam, Sam Johnson. And Robert Carter, and Madonna Constantine, tough year, gorgeous woman, amazing. We all owe you big.
