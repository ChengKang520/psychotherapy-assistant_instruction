WINNIE KING MD You know irritability and rebelliousness are just a normal teenage behaviors right, well not always for more than 3 million teens in this country there is signs of a mental illness, clinical depression that requires treatment with medication or therapy. But how can parents tell the difference, well to understand the answer, join us on a journey into the mind of a young women, who will show you what depression is really like, from the inside. 

00:01:25
Amanda’s Story 

00:01:30
AMANDA My name is Amanda (inaudible ). I live in the Bronx, three minutes away from the Yankee Stadium. My sister's name is (inaudible ), she is one minute younger than me. She is my twin sister. I remember I love her the most because we needed each other during our childhood. There is a lot of domestic violence going on. So we didn’t just play with each other constantly, but we also like hugged each other. And we would lay in bed together waiting for a screaming to stop. 

00:02:05
A Normal Life 

00:02:05
AMANDA Before I have depression, my life was just normal, I felt happy when I went to sleep, I felt happy when I woke up, I want to play, I remember constantly wanted to play with my toys and my dolls. There was no worries, no loneliness. That's the... that's the rest thing I remember there was no loneliness. Everyday we want to go to park, we will ask our mother, we want to go to the park today. We will go in the slides and the swings. Any... anything (inaudible ). 

00:02:45
Signs of Trouble 

00:02:45
AMANDA I started to feel different at about the age of 5 or 6. And it was, it wasn’t so, it wasn’t just suddenly, it was just at... the thing that happen eventually. First the loneliness, the sudden, even though know I was the child, I don’t want go out to play as much as I wanted before. At the age of 13, I became extremely depressed. I would sit for hours in my room starring at the walls. When I was about to turn 14, my mother took me to psychiatry... psychiatrist, because I had lost about 20 pounds. I think I realize something was wrong but I didn’t care. I felt cold all the time literally and figuratively. I felt sad, but I couldn’t even cry. I felt like when I woke up there was a cloud over me all the time it didn’t go away is just a cloud constantly over me. I couldn’t break free from it, there was no sunshine, there was no light at anytime (inaudible ). Going to sleep was useless because I was going to wake up and waking up was useless because it was just another day of sadness of, of nothingness. That's, that's the way I felt cold and nothing else. Then one day accidently, I bring myself recurring iron and it felt good in a weird type of way. It didn’t hurt that was the strange thing about it, it didn’t hurt. But the pain that I did, the little bit of pain I did feel there was a certain joy about it. To me it was like a release, beautiful release, hurting myself, cutting myself became a release. So that for a one second I wouldn't feel so much pain in time and cutting myself became a thing like a drug were you look for anything. I would use knifes, paper clips, the ends of sewing needles and anything possible. I was always in the backbone of my mind, while I was cutting myself. The fact that wow, in one instant I can just (inaudible ) with, the idea that you can take away your pain. In one simple instant is not as if you're going to missed your life, is not as if you're going to feel sad for those loved ones who are going to miss you, because you’re non-existent. It was like the best distraction, even better than cutting the knowledge that you’re going to kill yourself, that I was going to kill myself. 

00:05:25
A Terrible Resolve 

00:05:30
AMANDA I was 14 years old when I first try to commit suicide. Um… it was on a over dose of pills. I haven’t really planned (inaudible ) I didn’t see the... the needs and plan it. After that time there was two more times that I tried to commit suicide. 

00:05:55
Signs of Hope 

00:05:55
AMANDA I was (inaudible ) that I once was. I remember that there was a time when I was happy, when I was able to go to sleep in night, I was able to be free. I think that I have a future, just as anybody else does. I think that being able to hold on to that future, depends on me holding on to therapy, depends on me accepting that I have something that other people don’t have to contend with. I have some depression, if I keep taking my medications, I will have a future just as much as anyone else does. 

00:06:35
WINNIE KING I want to thank Amanda for giving us that extraordinary look and what depression means to a teen living through it. And I want to also welcome another teen to the show and that’s Vanessa Perez, who is also been diagnosed with depression and welcome to the show Vanessa... 

00:06:50
VANESSA PEREZ Thank you. 

00:06:50
WINNIE KING I'm so glad you’re here. I know you know Amanda she a friend of yours. Listening to her talk about what she went through, what she is continuing to go through? How would your experience with depression different from her's? 

00:07:00
VANESSA PEREZ I think It was different in the sense that she had a twin, she was kind a like a common... but like they bonded in certain ways that usually kids don’t bond. 

00:07:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:07:10
VANESSA PEREZ And I kind a isolated myself and cut myself off from other people. 

00:07:15
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:07:15
VANESSA PEREZ And I didn’t want to talk or anything. 

00:07:15
WINNIE KING Did you um… kind of shutdown so to speak in terms of not… 

00:07:20
VANESSA PEREZ Yes, I... 

00:07:20
WINNIE KING ...talking to people. 

00:07:20
VANESSA PEREZ ...I feel like everything is fine, I went on doing my everyday thing suppressing the way I felt. 

00:07:25
WINNIE KING Those are been really scary though to know that people are looking at you think everything is okay, but you’re knowing deep down the side that things are not so good. 

00:07:35
VANESSA PEREZ Yeah. 

00:07:35
WINNIE KING Yeah, well a doctor Dr. Alec Miller is the director of the adolescent depression in suicide program at form montefiore medical center. And also Dr. Miriam Kaufman is from the hospital for sick children in Toronto and she’s written a book for parents called "Overcoming Teen Depression: A Guide for Parents" and welcome both of you to the show. I know this must be um.. something that you're all very familiar with, but for those who watching and hearing this for the very first time, it’s very-very scary to hear young people talk about having these deep seeded feels, but yet putting on this ah... impression that everything is okay. You know Alec ah... everybody gets depressed at some point in their lives. I mean that, that is normal but um… let’s go through what depression really means? What is it? And why does it happen? 

00:08:15
ALEC L. MILLER PsyD Adolescent Depression Specialist Well clinical depression is a serious psychotic disorder. It results from a combination of biochemical factors in the brain and environmental factors. Some these environmental factors maybe life stressors like a death in the family, like death of the pet, ah… divorce of any ones parents were major academic failure. 

00:08:35
WINNIE KING Okay, in kids, young kids we’re seeing... we’re hearing about more and more depression now than ever before. Is there a, a certain sub group of more girls, more boys that kind of thing. 

00:08:45
ALEC L. MILLER In children under 12 the rates are about equal but once you reach adolescents, there is twice as many girls as boys who have depression. 

00:08:55
WINNIE KING Really? And how young? 

00:08:55
ALEC L. MILLER Well as you heard from Amanda it can start as early as age 4 or 5. But cert... certainly as you get into adolescents one in five teenagers experience major depression. 

00:09:05
WINNIE KING Wow, wow that, that’s amazing. Lets, lets talk about some of the characteristic symptoms of depression. Because that’s really what we want parents to pick up on what do they ah... need to know about um… symptoms what, what kinds of thing happen with depression? 

00:09:15
ALEC L. MILLER Well to have clinical depression you have to have atleast five out of nine symptoms, all day nearly everyday for atleast two weeks. And it has to effect your function in some way. 

00:09:25
• Depressed or irritable mood • Loss of interest or pleasure in activities • Change in eating & sleeping habits • Chronic fatigue or lack of energy 

00:09:25
WINNIE KING Okay, we... we have a list of these, we’re going just go through and then we can comment. Ah... lets first of all talk about depressed or irritable mood, I think irritable is a little surprising for parents. 

00:09:35
ALEC L. MILLER Most people don’t see irritability as a sign of depression, but certainly in adolescents there is a hallmark feature ah... and a lot of parents and school personals say this person has an attitude problem, I want people to consider that as a possible warning sign for depression. 

00:09:50
WINNIE KING Okay, loss of interest or pleasure in activities 

00:09:55
ALEC L. MILLER Lot of teenagers describe themselves as feeling bored all the time and not pursuing the activities that once gave them pleasure. 

00:10:00
WINNIE KING Yeah, a change in eating habits or sleeping habits. 

00:10:05
ALEC L. MILLER You might see… ah... changes in either direction, some people go in term of more sleep, more eating, they’ll see decrease sleep and decrease eating as well. 

00:10:10
SIGNS OF DEPRESSION: • Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt • Difficulty concentrating or making decisions • Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thinking or behavior • Physically agitated or physically slowed down 

00:10:10
WINNIE KING And then chronic fatigue and lack of energy, and you know lot, lots of parents complaint like their kids are behave that way "oh I can’t get up, I can’t do my homework, I can’t clean the house." Ah... Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt is also listed, as well as difficulty concentrating or making decisions. 

00:10:30
ALEC L. MILLER Yeah, I think you know the note worthy aspect of that is if you see deterioration in school performance that might be warning sign as well. 

00:10:35
WINNIE KING And um… and then recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thinking or behavior and then a physically, ah... physically being agitated or ah... being physically slowed down. 

00:10:45
ALEC L. MILLER Well we heard Amanda taking about recurrent suicidal behaviors and, and depressions is the diagnoses most commonly associated with suicide. So we have to take it seriously. 

00:10:55
WINNIE KING Now let look in for a second if we could about ah... this cutting and, and burning how common is that? 

00:11:00
ALEC L. MILLER Well it’s more common to people realize and ah... I, I believe people tend to do that as a way to escape those negative aversive emotions. 

00:11:10
WINNIE KING Yeah, Vanessa some of these symptoms are may or may not sound familiar to you. Um… lets talk a little bit about what you experienced when you were going through the throws(ph) of depression. What was your behavior like? 

00:11:20
VANESSA PEREZ I was very sad like, it kind a like you pulling your watch everyday. It’s like my sadness would be on me everyday. It’s like I would carry that around with me and it would be a burden to me. So I kind a not let people know that, that’s how I was feeling. 

00:11:35
WINNIE KING And sleep also was something that could tell you what was going on. 

00:11:40
VANESSA PEREZ Yes, I, I slept a lot. 

00:11:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:11:40
VANESSA PEREZ And that’s a sign for me that I’m trying to avoid what’s going on, so I would sleep as a way of avoidance. 

00:11:50
WINNIE KING Yeah and then your relationship with other people, with other things? 

00:11:50
VANESSA PEREZ I was in a lot of activities up until high school. And then when I got to highschool I kind of withdraw from everything. 

00:11:55
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:12:00
VANESSA PEREZ Like I didn’t, I was a cheerleader when I was in junior high, and then when I went to high school, I just decide I didn’t want to do that. Because it was a way like, I didn’t want to have to deal with putting on that to people. 

00:12:10
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… because you really did fell like there were something wrong eventhough you have this outward appearance. You know Miriam I know parents are wondering, how can you tell the difference you know when there is a child that's just being a teenager and a child that’s really in trouble. 

00:12:20
MIRIAM KAUFMAN MD Author, Overcoming Teen Depression Well I think the most important thing is the persistent of the symptoms, so your kid is like that one day it’s not a big deal, they’re just going through teenagers stuff. They... that are like one day a week that’s probably okay. But a kid who day in and day out seems to be feeling this way, you’ve got concerns about the don’t go away and that also applied a most of their life. So maybe they are going to school but their marks maybe aren't as good as they were when they were younger, they are, they don’t seem to be with their friend very much. All of those kinds of things should really took parents off. 

00:12:50
WINNIE KING Now what about parents behavior, can parents cause their children to become depressed? 

00:12:55
MIRIAM KAUFMAN MD The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto, Canada I don’t think parent cause their kids to be depressed, but I think there are few important things that, that can contribute. One is when a parent has a mental illness, when they’ve got depression or anxiety that can really affect their teens. Second as I think we heard from a Amanda abuse within the household, a lot of fighting, drinking in the household those things ah... often seem to associated with depression in teenagers. The third thing is more settled, we know that kids who are brought up with really rigid ideas about what it means to be male and what it means to be female, actually are more (inaudible ) depression. So the guy who has, who knows you’re not supposed to talk about your feelings or think about your feelings. Ah… the girl who thinks, I always just have to give and give and give take care of other people, I can’t take care of myself. That seems to increase the risk. 

00:13:40
WINNIE KING Well okay, you got a parent listing that says, "Okay, you know what I think that maybe going on with my kid". But how in a world do I bring this subject upto my child and get them to even consider going to get help. 

00:13:50
MIRIAM KAUFMAN I think you have to be very direct without being confrontational, without being judgmental about it. Be very… we don’t want our kids to be depressed right, so it’s our tendency to say, you’re not depressed are you? And I... I think not to… then they know what the right answer is, the answer is that’s right mom, I am not depressed. So, so don’t say things like that, never say, never um… and um… I, I think just to present it to them. Don’t worry that by bring up things about depression and suicide that you’re going to make your kid suicidal... 

00:14:20
WINNIE KING Yeah, I think... 

00:14:20
MIRIAM KAUFMAN ...it does not yes. 

00:14:20
WINNIE KING ... that's a great concern, it's like if I put this in their head then now they are going to think that they’re depressed. 

00:14:25
MIRIAM KAUFMAN Yeah. 

00:14:25
WINNIE KING And they were going to have big problem. 

00:14:25
MIRIAM KAUFMAN It’s in their head already or if it’s not in their head already they’re going to say. 

00:14:30
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:14:30
MIRIAM KAUFMAN No mom, this is what’s really going on with me. 

00:14:30
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… hmm… hmm… well I, I really just have to make a point on to the parents listening as an (inaudible )doctor I’ve been involved in taking care of kids when they are depressed, no one helps them and they wind up in the emergency room with either a drug overdose, they’ve shot themselves, they stab themselves. And looking back parents always live in the land of regret over this. You know there are lot of people that may see your depressed child then recognize that there is something wrong, but they are not going to do anything, you are the lifeline for that child and if you're not willing to step up and do something to help that child you may lose your child. A lot of parent expects someone else to come to them and tell them your child is depressed, did you notice Johnny was doing this. Sometimes parents… other people see things and they do nothing, so you’ve got to, as a parent be proactive for your child or you may actually suffer the ultimate loss, which is the loss of a precious child. Alec um… let... let’s talk a lit bit about Amanda because she sounds like she sort of coming well along with her, her road, her journey with depression, what kinds of treatments so available for kids with depression. 

00:15:30
ALEC L. MILLER There are basically two classes of treatment. One is cyclic therapy and one is medication. And some people use the combination of the two. In terms of cyclic therapy… ah... I want the consumers to know there are two treatments that have been shown to be effective in research. One is called interpersonal... interpersonal cyclic therapy and the other is called cognitive behavioral therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on challenging the negative thoughts people have about themselves, their world, their future, and ah… trying to help them come up with more right realistic ways of thinking about those things. 

00:16:00
WINNIE KING Okay. 

00:16:00
ALEC L. MILLER And behaviorally I want people to get more active because when you depressed, you become increasing more inactive, isolative and we need to get them out there and back into their lives. 

00:16:10
WINNIE KING And I'll say lot of kids now on medications for depression, what, what about giving kids medicine for depression? 

00:16:15
ALEC L. MILLER Well in term of children adolescents the research is, is questionable, I think some medication helps some of the kids, some of the time. So we can’t rely on it, but for some kids its, it’s a life line as we heard from Amanda. So I would say, it doesn’t change their personality however, I think it brings them back to… ah... hopefully whether, whether base line functioning it was.. 

00:16:35
WINNIE KING Yeah they were able to function. Vanessa what’s helped you, as you’ve gone down your journey with depression? 

00:16:40
VANESSA PEREZ I think um… the whole... I think upset kind a thing, like even if I was depressed I would still make a commitment to do the daily duty... duties of like going to school or making sure I go to therapy and when I go to therapy I would make like a commitment to myself, sit and talk. 

00:17:00
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:00
VANESSA PEREZ Because that soon a way like I would be able to express, you know what I was feeling… 

00:17:00
WINNIE KING And that can be hard for teens, because you know teens will talk anyway, right. You know they tend to not say a lot about what’s going on inside of them. So when you talk, when you share with other people, how you’re feeling? Does that help you? 

00:17:15
VANESSA PEREZ It, it helps me but it also help if I like have a therapist that can help me change my ways... 

00:17:20
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:20
VANESSA PEREZ ...or look at it from the different point of view rather than having a friend talk to me about it. 

00:17:25
WINNIE KING Yeah, yeah and Miriam there are some risks for teens that don’t get to... treated for depression. Tel us about that. 

00:17:30
MIRIAM KAUFMAN Well I think that um… there are number of them, obviously the most severe is that they may kill themselves. Um… but also this is a time of life when people are really developing and changing. And you’re not doing that when you’re, when you’re depressed and unmotivated and just sitting around. So that’s I think really key they lose out educationally, they lose out socially. Most kids will get better from a depression within 6 to 8 moths on their own. But that is a huge amount of time, that’s a whole school year. That you can effectively lose... 

00:18:00
WINNIE KING Hmm… hmm… 

00:18:00
MIRIAM KAUFMAN ...and of course the kids who don’t are really entrenched by then and maybe they increase risk for suicide. 

00:18:05
WINNIE KING Right and Alec you certainly see that too, I'm sure in your practice with kids that whether is there some of... some what of a late diagnoses with depression? 

00:18:10
ALEC L. MILLER And it’s a really concern and I think that as Miriam is saying there is lots of lost opportunities educationally and this is the time period where the developing in so many ways. We got to get them treatment. 

00:18:20
WINNIE KING Yeah, Vanessa tell us some how you’re doing now? You look great by the way, you know, how is it going for you? 

00:18:25
VANESSA PEREZ Um… it… I’m not at my highest point but I’m not at my lowest point. And I’m kind a like in the middle and I am struggling with certain things. But I’ve had my days where I’m you know much better than I am now, or I’m much happier. 

00:18:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:18:40
VANESSA PEREZ And it’s kind of like a roller coaster that... 

00:18:40
WINNIE KING Hmm... hmm... 

00:18:40
VANESSA PEREZ ...I've worked with my therapist and how to deal with. And know that you know I go up and down but that doesn’t mean that you know, it’s going to be the end when I go down. 

00:18:50
WINNIE KING What would say to ah... parents that are watching that have kids that are showing signs of depression and they’re not really sure, if they should do something to help them. What do you want them to know about how this is help to you? 

00:19:00
VANESSA PEREZ It, it taught me because I’ve been able to recognize certain things that are like my sleeping when I sleep for large amount of time, I know that, that’s a sign to myself that I’m sort of surprising a way I feel or avoiding things. 

00:19:15
WINNIE KING Yeah, well you know, I want to thank all of you for being here today and sharing on this very, very important topic inside on depression. Now if you suspect that your child is clinically depressed, I want you to talk with your pediatrician, you’ve got to get help. And check up the following resources as well.
