Career Counseling With Children: The Creative Career Constellation Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888 - 505 - 5576 Email: info@emicrotraining.com Website: www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates presents Career Counseling with Children: Live Demonstrations by Adam Zagelbaum, Ph. D. (c)2009 The Creative Career Constellation: Overview ADAM ZAGELBAUM, PH.D. 

00:00:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Welcome to this video of, ah, career interviewing in adolescents. Ah, essentially, this video is a compilation of, ah, technique in interviewing process, ah, that I've entitled the Creative Career Constellation but it is really based on, ah, other, ah, concepts and, ah, approaches that have been done over time, ah, to help, ah, young individuals understand how to, uhm, deal with the career, academic, and personal, social issues associated with, ah, career, ah, decision-making and, ah, goal-setting. Ah, it's, it's something I've entitled the Creative Career Constellation and essentially it is a mind-mapping technique which, ah, is basically a radial diagram that helps to visually as well as verbally explain to children, ah, ways in which careers and, ah, educational opportunities as well as their personal values come together in a way that showcases a dynamic, ah, way of approaching one's life opportunities. 

00:01:25
The Process of Career Constellations 

00:01:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM How to do the activity is simple, and, ah, it will be showcased on this video and subsequent segments. But, at the beginning we draw a circle, a circle basically in the, ah, center of a piece of paper or a chalkboard in this case. And we ask the child, "What is something that, ah, you like to do for fun? And what normally happens is I will get a response, let's say, ah, "Watch movies." And for the sake of this tape, ah, I'm going to, ah, abbreviate the exercise. But watching movies would therefore be the activity, ah, circle. And to link that to the ASCA National Model, it's a way of also tapping into somebody's personal values or personal identity. So this, in a way, is the personal domain or the social domain the in the ASCA model. And then the next, ah, thing that we would do as the school counselor or professional is to ask the child to say, "Okay. Watching movies is, ah, an interesting activity. Now, in terms of what people need to do in order to make movies happen, what are some activities or what are some jobs that you know that people must do in order to get movies out there for people to watch? And I can get any number of common responses to this question, and I draw as a result a second wave of circles that link to the initial concept. For example, people must write plots or come up with a story. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:03:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Is that they have to direct the actors. Without actors, essentially, there's no movie. And something else that might happen is that we also have to make a set or create scenery because at the very least, nobody acts that I know of in a vacuum in most movies. There have to be, ah, materials and, ah, related things that create the scenery upon which the actors will film a movie and act in the movie. There are certainly way more than three things that happen, but for the sake of this example, we will abbreviate this. So after the second wave of circles have been created, these essentially become what I believe are the career domains of the ASCA model. These are possible careers. 

00:04:25
[sil.] 

00:04:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And now, let me show you how we do the third part of the exercise, which is the academic domain. Based on what we've already put up on the board, if we had to go circle by circle and find out what classes we need or what educational opportunities we need in order to exceed or succeed or do very well at these particular careers, what would those classes be? Answers that I think would fit something that most people would say in the directing of actors circle would be, well, we need to have theater class or drama. 

00:05:05
[sil.] 

00:05:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  We can also therefore say, maybe a speech class because certainly being able to communicate and being able to articulate are important things for actors to do. There are certainly others, but for the sake of this exercise, I will, uhm, abridge this to make a set. Common responses I often get are art. I certainly get things related to shop class, carpentry, building, things of that nature. To write a plot, I would get English as a class. Also to a certain extent, ah, are related concepts, though, such as creative writing. 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:05:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Language arts. There are certainly many other things, and therefore, these stems that come out from the second wave of circles, are the academic domains or representation of academic domains that the ASCA model talks about. So, as a result of this, ah, theme that comes out, it's possible for the client or the child or the adolescent to come up with an idea of a short-term or a long-term goal that may engage them further in exploring this as a possible career option. 

00:06:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM In terms of, ah, what this video is about, we will be using this technique and, ah, showing you how two specific clients have, ah, been able to benefit from, ah, the use of this style of interviewing in this process. They're, ah, both, ah, young female, ah, students who, uhm, one is Madison, who is aged, ah, eleven and twelve at the time. She was very close to twelve. And the other is Kym, who is twelve and was going on thirteen at the time of this filming. Both of these, ah, young ladies are, ah, unsure to a certain extent about what they would want to do, ah, for careers. And, uhm, have different feelings about school in certain ways. Parts of it that they feel engaged in and enthusiastic about and parts that they do not. They also have family, ah, backgrounds that are a little diverse, ah, when compared certainly to one another. They also have, ah, positions within their respective sibling, ah, uhm, ah, constellation, if you will, that are, ah, slightly different. They also have, ah, other I think, ah, interesting personal qualities that I, I think showcase just how far-reaching this particular technique can be. There is an interviewing segment that I've engaged in with each child, as well as, uhm, an activity that, ah, they've done to draw this, ah, constellation on the board. Ah, so, ah, in each case, ah, viewers will be able to see how intricate this process can become. 

00:08:20

00:11:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And have you ever thought about, ah, ah, what that would be like if you, you know, can do it for a job? 

00:11:55
MADISON Uhm, a little bit. I, I, but like, I don't really have a steady hand to do a lot of stuff. 

00:12:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:12:00
MADISON I'm not the best artist. (laughs) 

00:12:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Really? 

00:12:00
MADISON  So, no. 

00:12:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM How come? (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
MADISON So. 

00:12:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM How come you feel that way? 

00:12:05
MADISON 'Coz, like, if I look at other people pictures, like in magazines... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:12:10
MADISON ...sometimes they have, like, pictures of people that we draw... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
MADISON ...and I'm not even close, like, they're very detailed and... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh. 

00:12:20
MADISON ...I'm, I sometimes copy off, ah, some stuff that they do, like, (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
MADISON like, if they have, like cheekbones and I draw that. 

00:12:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
MADISON But... (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
MADISON ...a lot of stuff I'm not too detailed about. 

00:12:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So, right now, it seems like if there's a lot that you have to do in order to make the art that good. 

00:12:35
MADISON Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  And maybe that's a reason that you're kinda hesitant to do that because it seems like there's so much that goes into it? 

00:12:45
MADISON Yeah. 

00:12:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is that fair to say? 

00:12:45
MADISON Yeah. 

00:12:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:12:45
Dr. Zagelbaum Explores Transition -Focus on feeling -Reframes "overwhelmed" as opportunity for exploration [Two minutes deleted] -Discussion of sibling rivalry 

00:12:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, ah, you get nervous maybe at first when you know you have to get the work done. But... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
MADISON Yeah. 

00:13:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...ah, when you make yourself, ah, sit there and finish, ah, maybe you feel less nervous? 

00:13:15
MADISON Yeah. 

00:13:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. And that's not unusual, I think, for, for young people, you know, especially people that are about to enter into middle school and they know that there's probably more work that has to happen. 

00:13:25
MADISON Yeah. 

00:13:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. So. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
MADISON More work. 

00:13:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. Uhm, More classes, uhm, more teachers. 

00:13:30
MADISON Yeah. 

00:13:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Ah, other things that you know about that's different in middle school? 

00:13:35
MADISON Ah, well, in elementary school we only have one teacher and we only had one class. 

00:13:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
MADISON So I'm a little nervous of making it to, ah, my classes and... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
MADISON  like having to stop at my locker for stuff. 

00:13:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure. 

00:13:45
MADISON And... (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
MADISON ...so I'm a little nervous if they're gonna get mad at me 'coz they might have a bad impression on me 'coz... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:13:50
MADISON Of my brother, very unorganized. 

00:13:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:13:55
MADISON And, so trying to be as good as I can be at it. So. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So You feel like sometimes you're gonna have to be your own person in order to, ah, ah, break free from some of the stuff that your brother might make other people believe about, ah, you. 

00:14:10
MADISON Uh hmm. Yeah. 

00:14:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. And that's, you know, that's interesting because, ah, you know, uhm, I think a lot of people sometimes feel that way when, you know, there's an older sibling, you, you know, brother or sister... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
MADISON Yeah. 

00:14:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...that, ah, uhm, everybody knows about and then in you come. Yeah. A little different. Uhm, in terms of, ah, you know, the other stuff, it also sounds similar to what you were telling me about art, you know, because you're saying, "Oh my God. There's so much detail. There's so much stuff I have to do." 

00:14:40
MADISON (laughs) Yeah. 

00:14:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Ah, and that's what I'm hearing you say about middle school. "Oh my God. I have to go from class to class. There's so much stuff I have to do. So that, that's kind of like a theme I'm hearing from you. It's like it seems like there's so much that has to happen that maybe if it didn't have to be so much, it, it, it might make you feel differently about it, is that fair to say? 

00:14:55
MADISON Yeah. 

00:14:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. Okay. Well, cool. All right, well based on, ah, some of the other stuff that we talked about, ah, maybe we should, ah, give it a shot and do this exercise and maybe we can figure out if there's a way of looking at, ah, uhm, you know, fashion or creativity or drawing in a way that maybe doesn't seem like, "Oh my God! There's so much!" (laughs) Would that be good? 

00:15:20
MADISON Yeah. 

00:15:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Well, let's go to the board. 

00:15:20
Career Constellation Exercise with Madison [Three minutes deleted] -Instructions about the creative career constellation -Madison chooses to explore fashion design. 

00:15:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  That's basically what we do. We create a bunch of circles that relate to the activity of drawing. Or specifically, in your case, kind of drawing fashion. 

00:15:40
MADISON Yeah. 

00:15:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  So in order to really be good at, ah, ah, this, you know, for a living, what are the kinds of things that people who draw fashion or design fashion need to do? What are, what are some of the steps they need to take or the people they need to work with? 

00:16:00
MADISON Uhm, I know clothing designers, which is, it's about the same thing. (laughs) 

00:16:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:16:05
MADISON But, uhm, they have to work with the people that make the clothes. 

00:16:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Hmm. 

00:16:10
MADISON Or the cloths and stuff. 

00:16:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So they have to work with people that, ah, create materials. And so what kinds of things they need to do with those people? What, what do they need to talk about or what do they need to, to understand? 

00:16:20
MADISON Uhm, the colors in the outfits. 

00:16:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
MADISON Uhm, the, they have to talk about, the, like the way the dress is supposed to, like, fit the person... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
MADISON ...or how it's supposed to look good. 

00:16:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So kind of, like, the style or, or, uhm, the way, uhm, it fits and the way it kind of, uhm, makes the person look overall, and that's cool. So, because of what you said, I draw a line from this, the activity circle, to the outside of the constellation. See how it's kinda like how stars are connecting? And so we're gonna call that "Talk to clothes makers". All right? We say 'coz the materials or the clothes makers. Is that pretty much what you told me? 

00:17:20
MADISON Yeah. 

00:17:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So that's one type of thing that they need to do in order to, ah, draw fashions and create the fashions. What's another thing? 

00:17:25
MADISON  Uhm, they have to take drawing classes. 

00:17:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. So, they have to be able to, ah, draw designs, right? 

00:17:40
MADISON  Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's true, you know. Uhm, other things you can think of? 

00:17:50
[Four minutes deleted] -Discussion of clothes styles -Materials currently in style -Finding an audience to show off styles. 

00:17:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM In order to, uhm, basically, ah, create a line of clothing, ah, you have to sell it, right? 

00:18:10
MADISON Right. 

00:18:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So in order to know how to sell something, who do you need to talk to or what do you need to do to make sure that you're selling it good? 

00:18:20
MADISON Hmm. I'm not exactly sure who you have to talk to, but I know someone that, a business, ah, definitely in business, or like how I see people on the street just selling clothes. 

00:18:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:18:35
MADISON  Uhm, but I'm not exactly sure who... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
MADISON ...they're with. So. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's okay. You see, and that's another perfect example about why, uhm, this is an imperfect exercise. It's a creative activity. It's not about, you know, facts per se or being perfect with your answers, but you did say a very important phrase. They have to be able to talk to business people because it's the business people that understand how to sell stuff. 

00:19:00
MADISON Right. 

00:19:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, what would you put in that circle? What, what words? 

00:19:10
MADISON Uhm, how to sell or, uhm, how to get, ah, like, uhm, you have to know, uhm, how to sell clothes. 

00:19:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Okay. So let's do that. Be able to sell. Does that work? 

00:19:35
MADISON Yeah. 

00:19:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Good. See, so you, that's very true. You need to be able to do a lot of things in order to make people wanna buy it. And so, ah, in terms of making people wanna buy things, are there other things that people need to do other than know how much it cost? 

00:19:50
MADISON Uhm, they have to know, like, material what, like, if it's a hundred percent cotton... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
MADISON ...or polyester. 

00:20:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
MADISON Uhm. 

00:20:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM You're doing good. Uh hmm. Okay, so the cotton, the polyester, ah, do you know what that kind of describes to me? I mean, ah, the way I look at it. 

00:20:10
MADISON Someone could be allergic or something so we have to know the things that are inside the clothing? 

00:20:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  That's right. So, uhm, what are the things that are inside the clothing? 

00:20:20
MADISON  Uhm, there's the material. 

00:20:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM See? And you say you don't know these things? You do. That's right, you know. Pick materials. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:35
MADISON  That would, that would look best without feathers... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:20:45
MADISON ...or something? 

00:20:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So that's for looks. And the other thing that you said too was, uhm, just in case, uhm, people may have a skin reaction or feel uncomfortable with it, so that, for looks but also for, let's say, health. 

00:20:55
MADISON  Stuff that's a very, thing that someone wouldn't particularly wear it till they work or. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
MADISON And then like a jacket over it, or. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Is that true? 

00:21:10
MADISON Yeah. 

00:21:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM I didn't know that. Basically, you're actually teaching me some stuff about fashion too, which I think is kinda cool. Okay, can you think of, ah, anything else that's, ah, maybe out there? 

00:21:20
MADISON  Uhm, none that I can think of. 

00:21:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's fine, because look what you did, though. What other classes? 

00:21:35
SKILL 2 PERSON-CENTERED / CLIENT FOCUSED 

00:21:35
MADISON Uhm, math. 

00:21:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM We'll put math. 

00:21:35
MADISON  It'll he, help a lot with the, ah, help like effective percentage, how much it should cost, the material. 

00:21:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's right. See, that's true, see. 'Coz you learn about percentages and stuff. And that's something that you can do almost right away in middle school. So if you have an idea that math links to being able to fashion draw, then you can make sense out, about, what you can do to help yourself become a good fashion drawer, because math is one thing that kinda links to it. You don't have necessarily have to be fabulous at math in order to be a fabulous fashion drawer, but the thing is, it helps. 

00:22:15
MADISON Uh hmm. 

00:22:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM It helps just a little bit more. So that's good. Those are three very good answers to that. You wanna try another one? 

00:22:20
MADISON  Uhm, ah, then "Know the audience." 

00:22:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:22:25
MADISON  Uhm. 

00:22:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM What classes help you understand people? 

00:22:30
MADISON  Uhm, probably, history. 

00:22:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. Here, you put that up there. Hmm. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Hmm. And it's cool, ah, you know, 'coz that class links to this idea. If we know about people in history, we might know what people today think and, and see if people have changed or, or been the same. That's one way. Is there another, ah, type of, ah, class... (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
MADISON Hmm. 

00:23:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...or activity? 

00:23:05
MADISON Drama, theater. 

00:23:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:23:05
MADISON Hmm. 

00:23:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  How so? 

00:23:10
MADISON Uhm, knowing their expressions are like, are like, kind of poker, if you can tell what, uhm, expressions they're doing... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:23:15
MADISON ...or bluffing and so you just have to know what they want to... (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
MADISON ...have, like sort of read their mind. 

00:23:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, you... (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
MADISON Make sure what they want. 

00:23:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...you, you can look how people, like, read their faces, or how their body, like, says something and, and basically tell if somebody's really excited about your fashion or if people aren't excited about your fashion. That's awesome! So drama or theater. That, that's great. You could put that up there. 

00:23:40
MADISON Or try to do expressions. 

00:23:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Well, either way, whatever you feel is right. The good news is this is your exercise. 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:23:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Cool. And, you know, uhm, just keeping in mind, too. The way I do it is just to put the name of the class up here, but as long as you know what this means, then I'm cool with that because this is for you. It's for you to understand and develop stuff and, you know. Great! Knowing how to read expressions or understanding drama, which is a class that you can take... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
MADISON Yeah. 

00:24:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...from middle school or high school. And maybe even in college. So that's great! Can you think of other stuff? 

00:24:25

SKILL 3 LINKING INFORMATION 

00:24:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - Social studies or things like that? Do you know what social studies really are? 

00:24:45
MADISON  Yeah. It's like history, sort of, but in a different term. 

00:24:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. Do you know what makes it a little different or can you describe any, some of the differences? 

00:24:55
MADISON Uhm, history is like what happened in the past. 

00:25:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
MADISON And social studies is sort of happening now and in the past. 

00:25:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Very good. So, maybe, you know, since we now know about the past, maybe we should also know about right now. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
MADISON Yeah. 

00:25:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So maybe social studies would be a good class. 

00:25:10
MADISON Ah. 

00:25:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Wherever you wanna finish it, you know. You see how that makes sense? 

00:25:15
MADISON Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And I don't know if you like social studies or history, but it is kinda cool that it helps link to something that... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
MADISON Matters that we're talking about... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM (inaudible ) Yeah. Yeah. 

00:25:26
MADISON (laughs) social studies and history... (crosstalk) 

00:25:26
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:25:26
MADISON ...and stuff like that. 

00:25:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Cool. Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
MADISON It grabs my attention, like the slaves and stuff grabs my attention. 

00:25:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure, there's a lot of things that I know that we've learned about that, that hopefully we'll never do that again. And... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
MADISON Yeah. 

00:25:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...you know, that sometimes what grabs people and if in, in, it could be linked in ways, maybe you never even knew about before because, you know, like, well, looking at how people used to dress and how people dress now, I'm sure there's other ways that you can figure out how to design new fashions for that. So, that's kinda cool. Okay, what do you think? Move on? Do another? 

00:26:00
MADISON Uhm, drawing designs? 

00:26:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:26:00
MADISON I know art is definitely one. 

00:26:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. That's fine with me. 

00:26:05
MADISON  Uhm, also, uhm, creativity, which is in art. 

00:26:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
MADISON But, no? 

00:26:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Well, there are art classes that are creative and not necessarily art classes. So, if you think, like with creativity is something that fits, you can put that up there. 

00:26:25
MADISON  Like crafts. 

00:26:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
MADISON And stuff. 

00:26:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Crafts or, or things where you build, you know? That's true, though, right? You do need to be able to put things together and work with machines and stuff and learn to, ah, make fashion, so it's not all about painting. Sometimes, you need... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
MADISON Hmm. 

00:26:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...to able to, to, to actually sew, when to use physical devices so. (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
MADISON Yeah. 

00:26:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's a good idea. Other things you can think of that help you draw or design things? Do you know... (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
MADISON Uhm. 

00:26:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...other tools? 

00:26:55
MADISON  Maybe, ah, woodwork. 

00:27:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
MADISON  Sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM How so? 

00:27:05
MADISON Uhm, I don't know. Just being, like, able to have a steady hand building stuff and being able to have a creative mind with working the wood... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:27:15
MADISON ...and what to do with the wood. 

00:27:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's not bad at all. So, yeah. Maybe, maybe, ah, deal with woodworking. Because you did say that, I remember earlier, you, ah, you talked about the fact that you need to have a good, steady hand in order to draw and do all those details. 

00:27:30
MADISON Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that, you know what? That might fit. Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't, but it's possible and that's what's really cool about that. Let me, let me throw this out, too. Uhm, do computers sometimes draw or design things? Do people kinda use, like, computer animation or computer drawings to, to create stuff? 

00:27:50
MADISON Yeah. And then, like painting on... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. 

00:27:55
MADISON ...the computer. 

00:27:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:27:55
MADISON Like I remember in second grade, I didn't use, like, the, now they make, like, the perfect circles and stuff. 

00:28:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh. (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
MADISON I didn't even used that. So, I guess, yeah, that would probably, would, yeah, that would, (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:28:05
MADISON that would work. Yeah. 

00:28:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:28:10
MADISON Computers. 

00:28:10
[Three minutes deleted] - Praise given to Madison for 

00:28:10
participation 

00:28:10
MADISON  I feel like there's something else coming but I'm trying to think what else. 

00:28:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, maybe. (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
MADISON Or if you look, uhm, I know this doesn't really have to do with school but, like, if you just look at, like, the, I know a lot of kids wanna be like celebrities. 

00:28:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
MADISON And what celebrities wear might help, like, to pick, ah, what other people would wanna wear. 

00:28:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that's interesting. You said that it doesn't really fit to school. Let's figure out how we can kinda- 

00:28:45
SKILL 4 POSITIVE ASSET 

00:28:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - make it work because there is a way that I think that it works. So, let's talk this out. 

00:28:50
MADISON Hmm. 

00:28:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  How do we even know what celebrities are wearing? How do we get that information? Where does it come from? 

00:28:55
MADISON  It comes from either movies, TV, uhm, and, yeah. 

00:29:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM It comes from, ah, these are TV, uhm, is it fair to say that it sometimes comes from books and magazines? 

00:29:10
MADISON Yes. 

00:29:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So books, TV, magazines, the internet, things like that. 

00:29:15
MADISON  Maybe, the newspaper... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And the... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
MADISON ...might help. 

00:29:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...newspaper. Right. So, what do you think? 

00:29:20
MADISON A yearbook, I think. 

00:29:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. Working on yearbook. Working on newspapers. You know what they call people who, ah, work on newspapers? Hmm? 

00:29:35
MADISON News reporters? 

00:29:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Reporters, right. So you can take a class maybe in reporting or, sometimes as it's known, journalism, because journalism helps you investigate, you know, kinda figure things out. And so that's a class that works. So, yeah, you don't have to put journalism on there if you don't want to. But, you know, if you know that that's what the newspaper is about, or yearbook stuff, or something like that, that helps fit. 

00:29:55
MADISON Yeah. It might, uhm, and, ah, for middle school, I might do the yearbook club. 

00:30:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Oh, that's awesome. So that's something that you might be, that's so cool. And that might totally link to your drawing. Then, by the way, that's the other thing that's interesting about this exercise, is that, you know, uhm, maybe you didn't even think about the fact that the yearbook stuff ah, can help you with your fashion work. But it totally makes sense when you think of it like this. 

00:30:25
MADISON Yeah. 

00:30:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is that fair to say? 

00:30:25
SKILL 5 LONG/SHORT TERM GOAL 

00:30:25
MADISON Yeah. 

00:30:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sounds great. Yearbook stuff is totally in line with some of the stuff that you may be thinking about one day if you wanted to be a fashion designer. Awesome.

00:30:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Look what you did. I mean, let, let, take a whole step back and actually look at how you took all these details and created a lot of different things for yourself, but I also want you to notice one other thing, too, 'coz you said, "Oh my God. There's so much you have to do to be a good drawer," or you, "There's so much you have to do to be a good, a good fashion designer." But look how many things are the same. Look at what art can help you do. Art is here. Art is here. Is there other places that you put art? 

00:31:15
MADISON Just on the subject, everything. 

00:31:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
MADISON Art. 

00:31:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
MADISON And crafts, too. 

00:31:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM The crafts fit. What is this? 

00:31:25
MADISON Social studies, about two kind(ph) of things. 

00:31:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
MADISON  Theater, expressions, and. 

00:31:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So when you think about it, you know, art, (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
MADISON Clubs. 

00:31:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM social studies, history, some clubs that you would join like yearbook and maybe a little bit of crafts. Those five things, if you put those together, those are five classes. Do you know about how many classes you usually take at a time in middle school? 

00:31:45
MADISON Probably six and seven. 

00:31:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Yeah. About five to seven classes. So, (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
MADISON Yeah. 

00:31:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM you know, when you think about it, instead of being like, "Oh my God. I don't know if I can do all that," guess what? You're doing what most people in middle school do. And I betcha, many of the people that used to ah, ah, be big or are big right now in fashion had to do some of the same things before they became big. So, I, do you see what I'm saying? 

00:32:10
MADISON Yeah. 

00:32:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Ah, I don't know if you're gonna do this for a living when you grow up. But it's not necessarily. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
MADISON Sure, I'm thinking about it. (laughs) 

00:32:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Really? Well, that's awesome, and, and hopefully this helps you a little bit because it becomes a little simpler, ah, instead of being like, "Uh-oh, I don't know if I can do all that," 'coz you're doing now about the five to seven classes that, that many people in middle school are expected to do. So you're actually right in line with this. You're not, like, so far behind. You're, you're actually, from what it appears to be someone on pace. So does that makes sense? 

00:32:40
MADISON Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  So, how do you feel now that you've seen all this? 

00:32:45
MADISON I feel better and, like, now I think I can actually do something like that. 

00:32:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
MADISON Uhm, normally I would just think it's something like, "Oh, I wanna swim with dolphins." And, (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:32:55
MADISON like it's a half jest(ph). 

00:32:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah(ph). 

00:32:55
MADISON  But now I'm, like, ah, not for me, and, well, I, I really like drawing and I like designing clothes, ah, and I like to read that stuff. On my free time, I just draw, normally. 

00:33:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, you did really well. I wanna, wanna point that out too 'coz I know you were nervous about whether or not you can do this. And, look, you, you not only did it, like, perfectly. You, you came up with so many different answers and it pretty much came from you. I know I helped you a little bit, but that's okay. That's, that's what are, people like me are supposed to come in and help because, you know, sometimes we have to be able ah, to help people think for themselves a little bit better. And, you know, you did that perfectly all by yourself.

MADISON  Like, I wanna own... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
MADISON ...a store, or like Hollister, Air Pastel(ph), Abercrombie. 

00:33:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:33:50
MADISON All those stores. 

00:33:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Awesome. 

00:33:55
MADISON And, like, create it like, new, oh, my own perfume, like, which has to do with science, so. 

00:34:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Right. 

00:34:00
MADISON Like, I don't, I wouldn't have to go back to, like, college, you do something like that, I would probably know already if I took a lot of those classes. (laughs) 

00:34:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. Maybe you would and, and maybe you would. (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
MADISON If I didn't, I would go back, you know? 

00:34:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that's the point. And if you didn't, you at least know where to go in order to get it, like, to own a store, you know, you probably need to... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
MADISON Business. 

00:34:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...get a business class or something in there. But if it didn't happen right away, you know, and you didn't become a store-owner right away, then maybe you focus on some of the other stuff, how to design the clothes and how to design the perfume, and then you can look back at this constellation and be like, "Wow, I actually did some of this. Maybe I should think about doing the rest of it now." So that's another way that these exercises work. So this is yours. You own it. You did fabulous, and, and I hope that, ah, you know, and do you remember ah, how this is gonna help you as you move into middle school and high school, and who knows where you're going after high school? But, you know, ah, all this stuff is available to you. That worked? 

00:34:55
MADISON  Yeah. 

00:35:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, awesome. Thanks, Madison, and... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
MADISON Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Ah, anything else that you have a question about or no? 

00:35:05
MADISON No. 

00:35:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Good. 

00:35:05
MADISON Good. 

00:35:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, well done. 

00:35:05

00:35:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  The constellation that, ah, you saw, ah, me do with Madison was, ah, more about, ah, the fact that, ah, she was overwhelmed or feeling concerned about the amount of stuff she was going to need to do in order to have a career, and that's not abnormal, I think, for somebody as young as Madison and uhm, obviously for somebody making a transition into middle school where, ah, all the classes are changing and all the dynamics are changing, and all of the students that she's ah, going to be around are going to be somewhat different than some of those students that she was around in elementary school. So the exercise pretty much was done the same way whereby she listed out her topics and she created her, ah, ideas about necessary courses or necessary, uhm, issues that, ah relate to the, ah, ah, activities associated with being a fashion designer. Ah, however, uhm, the, ah, additional spin that I put on it was to show Madison that ah, all of those complex ideas that you see behind me really boil down to about five, six or seven basic courses or basic activities that are within her immediate future. And I think in that way, she kind of felt better about her career choices, and hopefully you noticed too from the way that she interacted with me on the ah, tape that, ah, by doing that in session, she produced some thoughts and ideas that were somewhat advanced for somebody that's just entering in the middle school, such as the ability to take business classes or the ability to work with earth science in order to produce ah, ah, viable materials. And, ah, hopefully you recognized too that it's important just to be encouraging and, uhm, supportive of the ah, client.

ADAM ZAGELBAUM Twelve years old, okay. And where are you at in school? 

00:38:00
KYM I'm in eighth grade. 

00:38:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. And that, that means you're about to enter eighth grade, correct? (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
KYM Yes, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Okay. So how's school been for you so far? 

00:38:05
KYM Well, school's been good. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
KYM Yes. I get pretty good grades and do all the tests. 

00:38:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Well, what do you particularly like about school? 

00:38:15
KYM Well, I like that I get to see my friends everyday. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's one thing... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
KYM And I like it when I get good grades. That's, that's a pretty good part. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:38:20
KYM  And, ah, I like my teachers. 

00:38:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:38:25
KYM  Like, the nice ones. 

00:38:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Was there anything particular that you like about the teachers? 

00:38:30
KYM  Well. 

00:38:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Anything that they do, anything that, that you just feel about them? 

00:38:35
KYM  Well, if they're nice, and they, I mean, I can't really say that I like the teachers that don't give me homework. 

00:38:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
KYM So it's, (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:38:45
KYM I mean, that's not always a good thing. 

00:38:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:38:50
KYM So much, but I don't like homework, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
KYM I understand that it's something we have to do. So, but. 

00:38:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So that's part of what you have to do when you're a student, but it's not something that you necessarily have to like or enjoy. 

00:39:00
KYM  Yes. 

00:39:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. And, ah, you know, is there anything specific about homework that makes it not likable, anything specific that makes it, like, something you can't stand? 

00:39:10
KYM  Well, it takes a long time sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. So that's the amount of time you have to do the work. It's not necessarily... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
KYM Yes. 

00:39:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...because of the work itself. It's just because some of the work takes a while. 

00:39:20
KYM  Yeah. 

00:39:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. Anything, uhm, not harder to do than others? Is there some work... (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
KYM Well, like. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...that's trickier? 

00:39:30
KYM Like subjects? 

00:39:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:39:30
KYM In doing subjects? Uhm, math and science are sometimes harder. 

00:39:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:39:35
KYM  Ah, yeah, math and science. 

00:39:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Ah, so math and science are, are things that, that, that can be tricky. But what would you say are your, your best subjects? What are, what are the best classes that, ah, you take? 

00:39:50
KYM Math and maybe language class. 

00:39:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Well, that's interesting. Okay. So math is ah, something that's tricky and it may take a while, but it's also at the same time kind of one of the things you know you're best at. 

00:40:05
KYM Yes. 

00:40:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm, how do you feel about that? 

00:40:05
KYM Well, uhm, I know a lot of, a lot of things in life are that way, I mean. 

00:40:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
KYM Everything takes work, everything that's worth doing takes work. So. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. So, ah, do you think math is worth doing? 

00:40:20
KYM Yes, yes. 

00:40:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
KYM I do. 

00:40:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And, and where does that idea come from? 

00:40:20
KYM  My teachers (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
KYM ...and my parents. 

00:40:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So a lot of adults, I guess, uhm, like, show you that and, and... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
KYM Yes. 

00:40:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...they kind of go along with that. And that's kinda interesting because not all the time do people, uhm, fully believe everything that a teacher, a parent says, and that's great that, uhm, you are able to, to, to believe them and, and you go with it and even though it may not feel great to sometimes be sitting around doing a lot of homework, ah, you still know that it's important because other people are believing- 

00:40:55
SKILL 2 PERSON CENTERED / CLIENT FOCUSED 

00:40:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - it's important, too. And it sounds like you feel that way personally. It sounds like you yourself believe that it's something that's gonna help you. 

00:41:05
KYM Well, yes. 

00:41:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
Kym's Background - Age 11 - Parents from West Indies - Divorced - Mother has primary custody - Weekly face-to-face contact with father occurs - Only child - Currently in middle school 

00:41:05
KYM Well, I know my dad and what he does. He uses a lot of math. 

00:41:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
KYM And I know even, almost every job does something... 

00:41:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
KYM ...even if it's a little bit farther that has to do with math, even if once if you work at a store, anywhere to be able to get everything. 

00:41:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So it's fair to say that no matter what your job is, if there is some kind of number or some kind of, you know, concept that relates to what you do in Math class involved, Math is important? 

00:41:45
KYM Yes. 

00:41:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm. And it's interesting 'coz not a lot of people your age, uhm, sometimes make those connections where you think about getting the good grades and we think about maybe, thinking about, uh hmm, doing well in class but we don't think about the fact that people use this stuff outside of the classroom. 

00:42:05
KYM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that's interesting that you kinda know that maybe because your parents do that or maybe because in general you just see those things that, that people seem to do no matter where they work that relate to math. 

00:42:15
KYM Yes. 

00:42:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Well, that's great. Now, in terms of, like, your own jobs and your own ideas now, have you thought about what you ever wanted to do when maybe you're done with school? 

00:42:25
KYM Not so much, actually. 

00:42:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
KYM  Not so much. 

00:42:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. And so you're kinda up in the air right now. 

00:42:30
KYM  Yes. 

00:42:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Have you thought about, hmm, even coming up with some options or some ideas, I mean, just off the top of your head? 

00:42:40
KYM Well, I mean, sometimes, you know, you see things just randomly like... 

00:42:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
KYM ...one, in your daily activities and sometimes, you think, well, that's, that would be a nice thing to do or... 

00:42:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
KYM ...that seems fun, but I mean, I haven't really sat down and thought about it. 

00:42:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. And that's not necessarily unusual either because, you know, when you're about 12 or 13, sometimes people don't really ask you, "Hey, how are you gonna make money?" or, "What are you gonna do for a living?" or "When you're done with school, what do you think you can have for a job?" because, ah, that still seems a little far away, still seems a little bit, ah, off, and so we don't often really sit down, come up with the serious plan about it. Is that fair to say? 

00:43:20
KYM Yeah. 

00:43:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. Do you have friends that know what they wanna do? 

00:43:25
KYM Well, yeah. 

00:43:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. So what are the kinds of things that, ah, some of your friends, ah, wanna be when they grow up? 

00:43:30
KYM Well, I have a friend that wants to be a lawyer. 

00:43:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
KYM I have a friend that wants to be an artist. 

00:43:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Wow. 

00:43:35
KYM He's very good at it. 

00:43:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:43:35
KYM  And I have friends that want to be doctors and engineers and actors, and... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
KYM ...lots of things. 

00:43:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So when you hear about the fact that they have those decisions, they have those choices, how do you feel in comparison to them? 

00:43:55
KYM Well, uhm, uhm, well, I kind of, I think that it's good that they have, you know, made choices and, (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
KYM ...and they know what they wanna work toward. 

00:44:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:44:10
KYM But still somehow, I haven't really settled on anything. So, so I think. 

00:44:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Do you think that's a good thing, a bad thing or it just is what it is? 

00:44:20
KYM I think that it's not really a good thing but it's not really a bad thing. 

00:44:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So it can be a little bit of each. It just depends, I guess, on how much you wanna think about it and that's fair to say, too, because not everybody really thinks about it ah, the same degree. I mean, some people take a little more time to make a decision. Some people decide right away and that doesn't necessarily mean that that's a bad thing. It just means that maybe they haven't really thought about it that much or maybe they need more time to really understand what the choice needs to be. And maybe as a result of us kinda talking today, uhm, maybe we can explore a little bit about some of the stuff that's out there and maybe get a little bit of an idea about what kinds of choices you might make right away, a month from now, a year from now or somewhere along the line because that's the key to this type of activities just to think about the fact that you have choices, and maybe in so thinking about those choices, you may be more able to make a decision. Does that make sense? 

00:45:25
KYM Yeah. 

00:45:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Okay. So, uhm, why don't we go to the board and take... (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
KYM Okay. 

00:45:30

00:45:55
KYM I cook sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
KYM ...but, well, yeah, sometimes. 

00:46:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Would you ever really wanna be ah, a cook for a living and get paid? 

00:46:05
KYM Well, maybe I do. 

00:46:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Well, we'll try that and see... (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
KYM Okay. 

00:46:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...where it goes, okay? And so we'll try cooking. Okay? So cooking is the activity. 

00:46:15
KYM Okay. 

00:46:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Now, in order to be, a, a good cook, what are some of the things that ah, you have to do well? And I know that that's an open-ended question, but, uhm, in terms of, I mean, 'coz it's easier to say, well, you gotta be able to cook chicken, you gotta be able to cook meat, you gotta be able to, you know, cook soups. Uhm, let's link less about the specifics and, and more about some of the general things that a good cook needs to do in order to make a good job. So, uhm, what are some of those things that a good cook needs to do? 

00:46:50
KYM Well, just how we were saying on how there is a little bit on math, math... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:46:50
KYM  in every job, 

00:46:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
KYM well, something you have to be able to do is measurements... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
KYM ...a little bit. 

00:46:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  That's great. So you have to be one. 

00:47:00
[sil.] 

00:47:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  You have to measure items and you have to make sure you're getting them right. Okay. That's an idea. And let me give you a piece of the chalk. Maybe you can take the big one. 

00:47:15
KYM Okay, thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Just in case you have other ideas, and what else can you think of? 

00:47:20
KYM Well, and I have to be able to follow directions... (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh. 

00:47:25
KYM ...for the recipes and stuff. 

00:47:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's great. So maybe you can put that on there. There's no right or wrong to it. 

00:47:30
KYM Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Just put something on there that means something to you. 

00:47:35
[sil.] 

00:47:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Perfect. Uhm, you got another idea? 

00:47:40
KYM  Uhm, I'm thinking. 

00:47:45
[sil.] 

00:47:45
KYM  I don't know. 

00:47:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, well, ah, let me, let me lead you toward some other things. Okay. So let's say you are a good cook and people, uhm, you know, ah, know that. Uhm, what do you have to do in order to get them to ah, to come to a restaurant or get them to come to a place where you cook? 

00:48:10
KYM Well, I guess you have to advertise... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
KYM ...just a little bit. 

00:48:10

ADAM ZAGELBAUM - for example, in order to be good in advertising, what type of class do you need? 

00:48:50
KYM Maybe Economics. 

00:48:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. That's right. Good. Don't. (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
KYM And maybe that for the quality ingredients. So... (crosstalk) 

00:48:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM I think you're right. 

00:48:55
KYM ...you have to. 

00:48:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Uh hmm. Now, you said economics. I'm just gonna say that louder just in case people didn't hear. Can you see it? So I put a little stem outside this circle to show that that's the class. And so that class of economics, sales(ph) with advertising and you also said it would probably help with buying quality ingredients. I think you're totally right about that. So, do you think there's other places on there or another class that, ah, kind of relates to some of these circles? 

00:49:25
KYM  Well, I'm not sure. No. But, uhm, maybe, I mean, I guess I don't really think there are classes that are just called cooking. But I mean for some of them like. (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, there are classes called cooking, but you don't necessarily take them in, ah, middle... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
KYM Alright. 

00:49:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  school or high school. But say, see what I'm saying, it, it's, it's totally open. You can think about this in terms of college. You can think about this in terms of high school. You can think about this in terms of, ah, a special school for cooks. So, ah, yeah, there are cooking classes. You want to put a cooking class up there? 

00:50:05
KYM Okay, that would be for my cooking. Probably, well, I don't know if there's a class for this one. 

00:50:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, there might be. I mean if you feel if that's where a cooking class goes because I'm sure that you get, if there were a... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
KYM Well, yes. 

00:50:20
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...class for specific cooking, they would probably wanna make sure you follow the directions. Is that fair to say? 

00:50:25
KYM Well, yeah. 

00:50:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Okay. So let's put it on there. 

00:50:30

KYM Oh, yes.

ADAM ZAGELBAUM Have you heard of it? (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
KYM I, I know. 

00:50:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Okay. So I'll just put that on here too just so you know that these things exist. Okay? We'll, we're just thinking out loud. There's nothing, uhm, this isn't a, a definite plan. This is just ah, a bunch of options that are there. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:51:05
KYM Hmm. 

00:51:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, uhm, any other place you wanna put that? 

00:51:05
KYM  This and... (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:51:10
KYM ...this would probably be, you know, home economics and cooking. (crosstalk)

ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Now, in terms of being able to, to determine how things kinda look right or don't look right, is there a class where you, if you judge something and you try to put it out there in a way that looks good to the human eye, you know, is there a class that kinda makes you have to think about how people look at art or look at beauty or look at creativity? 

00:52:00
KYM  Well, art, maybe. 

00:52:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm, okay. I know we kinda like led you in to that a little bit, but isn't that fair to say? (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
KYM Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And if, if art kinda helps people find things that look appealing, maybe art kinda relates a little bit to cooking. 

00:52:15
KYM  And then maybe menu(ph), what kind it would be? I guess that could do, be something with, like, language. 

00:52:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yes, I think so. (crosstalk) 

00:52:25
KYM Yeah. 

00:52:25
KYM In fact, you know, it's kinda funny to me, ah, there's sometimes a class, ah, maybe you've heard of it. It's called language arts. 

00:52:35
KYM Yes. 

00:52:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And so that's kinda neat. It's kinda like art with words. 

00:52:35
KYM  Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, maybe we can put that in here. Have you ever taken language arts? 

00:52:45
KYM Oh, yes. 

00:52:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
KYM I think there(ph) were.

KYM I, I didn't.

KYM Yeah.

ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Now, in terms too, I mean you know what I'm most, ah, surprised about? Of all the things that are on the board, the things that I'm seeing the most often, I mean look. You have math up there, one, two, three, four times. 

00:54:40
KYM  Yeah. 

00:54:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And, ah, you know, let's see. Is there anything that appears at all, economics is kinda like math. 

00:54:50
KYM Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:54:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Right? And that's what you said earlier, right? 

00:54:55
KYM Yeah. 

00:54:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, so you have economics here, some home economics here. 

00:55:00
KYM Home economics is up there. 

00:55:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Thank you. And, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
KYM Home economics is over here. (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yes, it's over here too. How many times do we get a math or an economics course up there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times, and I don't know if there is anything else that appears on a board that much, which is kinda cool. I mean let's see, food science and science. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
KYM Four times. 

00:55:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM One, three. Yeah. It's only about four times. We've got art up there about two or three times. We've got cooking classes up there about three times. So, look at that. One of the classes that you, ah, seem to do the most or at least feel good about the most, math, is still out there more than anything else. So even though cooking may not be something that you immediately thought about when you wanted to grow up and become a, a professional chef, uhm, the math and the stuff that you like about math seems to help you recognize that it fits. So... (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
KYM Okay. 

00:56:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...it's kinda good to see that, you know, what you're doing right now in school is an important thing for you to be thinking about in terms of whatever you wanna be when you grow up. 

00:56:15
KYM Yeah. 

00:56:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So it all- 

00:56:15
SKILL 5 LONG/SHORT-TERM GOAL 

00:56:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - seems to fit, which maybe, you know, 'coz you were telling me at the beginning of session you weren't sure if it was so good that you didn't have a decision. So many of your friends, kinda knew what they wanted to do. Well, even though you don't have a definite decision made, the stuff that you're doing right now in school may make it easier for you to make that decision because, "Wow, I'm really good at something that's really that important. 

00:56:40
KYM Yeah. 

00:56:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And so maybe when it's time for me to make the decision, it will be easier because I actually know how to do the main stuff pretty well. Does that make sense? 

00:56:50
KYM Yes, it does. 

00:56:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM How does it feel to hear that? 

00:56:55
KYM Well, it's good to know that, you know, what I'm doing now will help me later 'coz a lot of people think, a lot of the kids anyway think. 

00:57:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
KYM That school is just something they make us do. 

00:57:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
KYM But it shows that it's really, it really connects to the rest of our life. 

00:57:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, that's great. 

00:57:10
Pause for discussion - What are Kym's main ideas about school? - What are Kym's main ideas about work? - What are Kym's most significant influences? - What are some other pieces of background information that would be relevant to gather about Kym? Career Constellation Exercise #2 with Kym [Background info deleted] - Client has already provided initial interview 

00:57:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Is there anything that you do, like, for fun or as a hobby or, ah,- 

00:57:40
SKILL 2 PERSON CENTERED / CLIENT FOCUSED 

00:57:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - things that you're interested in doing that maybe you'd get paid for? 

00:57:45
KYM Well, I do play the violin in school and I enjoy that. 

00:57:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Playing the violin? (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
KYM It's something that I like, yes. 

00:57:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Well, then, let's put that up there. Let's put play the violin. Okay? Okay. So that's the activity. Now, based on what it takes to be a successful violin player, okay, what are some things that you really need to do well in order to get paid a lot of money or paid decently for that job? 

00:58:10
KYM  Well, you need to be able to read notes. 

00:58:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Let's put that up there. Able to read notes. And now we have put that in a sort of a circle that's connected to the big circle. What else? 

00:58:30
KYM You have to be able to count when through them. 

00:58:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. Well, you, you wanna explain that more? It sounds good to me. You have to count (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:58:41
KYM Well, when you read it, you have to be able to know that some quarter note comes after a rest, then you don't play on the rest that you play on the quarter note. It's actually. 

00:58:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
KYM Yeah. 

00:58:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM There are different types of notes that require different types of length or different types of timing. When you know the timing, it helps you play the song better. So I agree with you. That, that's very good. You've got other ideas? 

00:59:00
KYM  Uhm, well, you have to be able to follow, looking up there, and you have to know, like, if you make a certain move, you know, that means you have to start playing and you have to stop playing and, yeah. 

00:59:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's good 'coz you have to be able to take direction especially if you're in an orchestra. You can't be playing out of turn. That's very important. So, good. Other things that you know that ah, a good violinist, ah, would be able to do well? 

00:59:30
KYM  Well, you have to be able to blend with other people. You can't just look alive(ph), so good, and I, I just wanna put, you have to do a little blend. (crosstalk) 

00:59:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's interesting. Okay. So when you say blend with people, you mean get along with other people? Or what do you mean? 

00:59:45
KYM Well, that too. But I was just thinking in a lot of people playing the orchestra, that's, it's important to be able to not just try and stand out, but stand out when you need to if you get to but only this, stay within where you need to be. 

01:00:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Teamwork, is that fair? 

01:00:10
KYM Yeah. 

01:00:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM I know you're kinda talking too musically 'coz, you know, you don't wanna play too strong when you have to... (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
KYM Yeah. 

01:00:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...keep it soft. And you don't want to, ah, you know, disrupt the other musicians just because you know that there's a way that you wanna play the piece that's different than they, ah, play it. So, uhm, I think teamwork sounds close to what you're saying. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
KYM Yeah. 

01:00:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is that, is that. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
KYM Yeah. 

01:00:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So.

[Two minutes deleted] - Instructions about 2nd phase of exercise 

01:00:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  What are some classes or learning opportunities that we have to do- 

01:00:50
SKILL 3 LINKING INFORMATION 

01:00:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - in order to make sure we do a very good job at these things? 

01:00:50
KYM  Well, I know, I don't know if this exactly what you're looking for, but I remember one time at camp, music camp, we took a conducting class and they taught us a little bit about counting rhythms and following... (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:01:10
KYM ...the conductor. So that was something, I think. (crosstalk) 

01:01:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, I think that's actually quite possible. I mean we can put here, ah, music class, right? Is it possible that music goes up here as a class but also the fact that you can go to a camp for it? 

01:01:25
KYM No. 

01:01:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is that. (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
KYM 'Coz... (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm? 

01:01:25
KYM ...we chose a (inaudible ). It was conducting this. (crosstalk) 

01:01:32
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:01:32
KYM We shall, it was, yeah, so. 

01:01:32
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  So, is that fair? I mean, if we put music up on some of these things? 

01:01:35
KYM  Yeah. 

01:01:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Anything else other than music camp provides people opportunities to get you more specific with some of these things in the circles, so I think that kinda helps. And certainly, uhm, camp helps you do that in terms of getting along with people and understanding dynamics because that's... (crosstalk) 

01:01:55
KYM That's true. 

01:01:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...why- 

01:01:55
SKILL 4 POSITIVE ASSET 

01:01:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - it's a camp basically. Is that clear? 

01:01:55
KYM  Yup, that's clear. 

01:02:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. I'll put that up here too. 

01:02:05
KYM And then for the other two, the, uhm, something, probably economics for advertising and money managing. 

01:02:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Economics, okay, 'coz we do need to understand, ah, how money fits into advertising, and we certainly need to know how it fits into managing money. 

01:02:20
KYM  And math to save money. 

01:02:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Math, certainly.

Dr. Zagelbaum Explores Interests - Multiple constellations - Modeling of career and academic links - Reframes course material as important foundational pieces to career pursuits [Five minutes deleted] - Discussion about economics and language arts 

01:02:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Let's take ah, helping other band members out there. You know, when you spoke about in terms of, uhm, you know, possible teaching or possible, uhm, being a good role model or things related to, to being a good guide for people that need help. So, are there classes or learning opportunities or things that you know of that people do in order to become good at teaching or leading or helping? 

01:03:15
KYM  Uhm, what? I don't really know of any, maybe teaching classes. 

01:03:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:03:25
KYM  Yeah. 

01:03:30
ADAM ZAGELBAUM There is a way to actually learn about how to teach, so there is classes that help you learn how to teach, and it's possible, you know, also to become a teaching assistant. 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  And that may happen way down the line. It may not be something that happens right away when you go to school. It may not be happen- 

01:03:55
SKILL 5 LONG/SHORT-TERM GOAL 

01:03:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM - something that happens, ah, in the next few years of your schooling, but if you have an idea that it's possible to get that training, you may wanna think about it someday. 

01:04:05
[Five minutes deleted] - Discussion about the role of a conductor 

01:04:05
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Okay. There's just one more circle that I kinda wanna approach with you a little bit, okay? 

01:04:20
KYM  Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that would be this blend with people and be a good team player and, ah, not to be too strong with the way you play some music, okay? (crosstalk) 

01:04:30
KYM Well, actually being in orchestra's helps with that. (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM That's right. 

01:04:35
KYM So, orchestra in school play less. 

01:04:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Absolutely. We'll call it band or orchestra. 

01:04:40
[sil.] 

01:04:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Could you think of anything else, I mean, other classes where, ah, you have to do a lot of things in groups or teams? 

01:04:55
KYM Gym. 

01:04:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Is that possible? 

01:05:00
KYM Yeah. 

01:05:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM I mean it may not sound at first like it's possible, but when we think about it, playing an instrument requires a lot of physical skill. 

01:05:10
KYM That's true (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

01:05:12
ADAM ZAGELBAUM And in gym, you do have to have hand-eye coordination. And in gym, you do have to have the ability to move around and be limber. And in gym, you do have to be able to play on a team and, ah, sometimes show that you're not in control of the whole thing just because you're the best player. Now, sometimes teamwork is come, comes out of physical activity. So I think it was very, ah, wise of you to actually come up with the word, gym. Because, you know, if you keep your body fit, you can play better. And if you work with other people in a gym class, you also can get along with them better. Is that fair to say? 

01:05:45
KYM  Yeah. 

01:05:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. So let's really take a step back and see what we've got here. I mean, there's a lot of Math. It seems that that fits in this. 

01:05:55
KYM Economics. (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  There's a lot of economics. Yeah. I see that fitting in there. And there's even opportunities to teach or conduct, which, you know, not everybody thinks about when they think about playing the violin. They don't think about, well, the fact that I could teach somebody how to do this or the fact that I can one day lead the orchestra. They think more about playing the violin and just being the best violin player. But as you can see, there's many opportunities that exist because of the fact that you're learning an instrument. And so there's more career options out there that maybe you never really saw before because you were just focusing on just doing the violin playing. Is that fair to say? 

01:06:35
KYM Yes, and yes. 

01:06:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is there anything else that jumps out of you as we, ah, as we did this? 

01:06:40
KYM  No. I, I would never have thought about really managing one... (crosstalk) 

01:06:45
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  Yeah. 

01:06:50
KYM ...in advertising, because I, I guess when you just think about playing, you think about playing, but not really everything else that might come along with it, (crosstalk) 

01:06:55
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:06:55
KYM  and so... (crosstalk) 

01:07:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM We'll, that's good to know that, that you can make that link 'coz there's a lot of people that really never believe math matters that much because you can always hire somebody to do the job for you or you can always, you know, find somebody who can help you with your money. You don't need to do it yourself. But that's not always true, you know? The money comes with the job. And as a result, you may need to be a little more able to do things with math because if you're more able to do things with math, then you don't have to rely on too many other people to help you out, which is another thing that's good about being a successful worker, you know? You can do it and hopefully do it well by yourself. Sometimes, independence is a big thing, kind of like being a good solo artist is being a big thing even though you can play with people in a band too. 

01:07:45
KYM  Yeah. 

01:07:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM So did that work? 

01:07:50
KYM Yes, it does. 

01:07:50
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. In general, what did you like about doing this? 

01:07:50
KYM  Well, this pretty much, I mean, like, I was kinda surprised that gym, I, (crosstalk) 

01:08:00
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:08:00
KYM I never really thought about that but just how really everything you do in school, it just kind of helps with... (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh hmm. 

01:08:10
KYM ...what you do as you get older... (crosstalk) 

01:08:10
ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

01:08:10
KYM ...later in you life? 

01:08:15
ADAM ZAGELBAUM It's surprising, you know? And I, I'm glad you kind of picked that out there. But remember you, you did it on your own, which I think is great. You've made that connection without really, uhm, much prompting from me. So, even though, ah, it surprised you, it's like, wow, that makes sense. And as a result, you know, maybe you have a different appreciation for school or some classes that maybe you're good or not so good at because it really relates to so many other things besides just what you're learning in the classroom. 

01:08:40
Kym displays insight - Finds themes in both constellations - Reframes importance of gym/physical education - Improves view of self through career options - Demonstrates appreciation of learning - What are the pros and cons of using multiple career constellations for a single client? - What are the pros and cons of using a structured approach to the constellation as opposed to a more open-ended approach? Other questions to consider - What are the connections that can be made between this constellation and the previously constructed constellation? - What are some long-term and short-term goals that Kym could create for herself as a result of constructing both constellations? - How is Dr. Zagelbaum's approach to the exercise similar and/or different for each constellation that Kym constructs in this session? Concluding Remarks 

01:08:40
ADAM ZAGELBAUM  So in closing, let me simply say at this time that, ah, the, the opportunities to work with students especially adolescents to talk about career goals and career activity can inspire and enthusiastically engage people in a way that, ah, simply the learning process or the importance of attending school can lay a foundation for but not necessarily engage the child and the adolescent and the student in. This career constellation process is one way and a one, I think, effective model to help inspire those options within the child and hopefully within the significant others in his or her life that can also lead to other decisions that may also empower and support them as they become effective learners, citizens and members of society. And with that, I, I hope this video has been informative and instructive.
