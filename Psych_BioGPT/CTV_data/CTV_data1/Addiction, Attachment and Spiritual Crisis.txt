THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove

JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome I'm Jeffery Mishlove. Our topic today is addiction in the spiritual quest. With me is Christina Grof who is the co-creator of Holotropic Breathwork and the founder of Spiritual Emergency Network. Christina is the author of the Thirst for Wholeness and co-author with her husband Dr. Stanislav Grof of a number of books including The Stormy Search for Self, Spiritual Emergency and Beyond Death. Welcome Christina. 

00:01:00
CHRISTINA GROF Thank you… thank you. 

00:01:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be with you. 

00:01:00
CHRISTINA GROF It's a real pleasure to be here. 

00:01:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE When we think of addiction many people still don't feel that there might be a connection with… with the spiritual quest and in fact they almost seem as… as if they opposite ends of the spectrum, yet it was as… as you point out in the thirst for wholeness a phrase that comes from the great Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung is it something that took place many decades ago, he… he recognized in a letter to the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous that… that there is a relationship between alcoholism and the spiritual quest. 

00:01:40
CHRISTINA GROF The Thirst for Wholeness Yes I… I would never have understood there was a connection between the two because they seemed really opposite ends of the spectrum and certainly growing up, the image of an addict or an alcoholic was of some kind of low level human being who had no self control kind of no ethical standards and so that was a prevailing image and I think it is still the prevailing image in some people's minds. 

00:02:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE We sort of struggle to say whether alcoholism is a immoral illness or a medical. 

00:02:15
CHRISTINA GROF Well there was a real revolution I think in the… in the mid 50s when the American Medical Association among others recognized alcoholism as a disease and that kind of opened… opened the door to treating addiction as something more than a… than a moral ethical problem you know now we weren't bad people trying to be good. We were sick people trying to get well. 

00:02:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm…m. 

00:02:40
CHRISTINA GROF I of course think that is beyond that of course there is the physical manifestations of addiction particularly, chemical addiction. They are the emotional, mental, social problems aspects of addiction but I also now understand that there is a deep spiritual part to addiction and… and that… that the addict is really looking for something and looking for it in the wrong places. 

00:03:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… Many spiritual thinkers and I suppose particularly in Buddhist philosophy suggest that all of our longings or attachments and our addictions are ways in… in which we try to fill an inner emptiness that… that has to do to with our… our alienation somehow from… from the divine. 

00:03:35
CHRISTINA GROF And I think that is very much the… the dilemma of the addict when I began my own recovery from alcoholism I immediately saw the connections between addiction spirituality but also suffering there is a Buddhist idea that the root of all suffering… suffering is attachment and I began to think that the addict or the alcoholic is simply an exaggerated form of the rest of us as we deal with attachments, that every human being has attachments something that they cling to or hold on to but not every human being is an addict and so an addict is kind of on the very far end of the spectrum of… of the rest of us. 

00:04:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Although it seems as if are definition of addiction is changing daily. 

00:04:30
CHRISTINA GROF Yes… yes and I think that's… that's a very good thing, you know I… I… I hate to think if I had gone… gone into recovery for my own addiction 30 years ago what the atmosphere would… would be like so it is changing and I think a lot of that change is coming from the grass roots level from people who have struggled with their own addictions who have come into recovery who are supported by a community of other people who have also made that journey and are discovering that this is about quality of life. This is about the spirit is much more than the physical or medical implications of addiction. 

00:05:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Of course there are those implications and you know some people just have strong attachments and other people get addicted and perhaps they are genetic factors or… or family factors that are involved in that. I think the interesting thing for me about alcoholism as… as a model of a classic addiction is that on the one hand while we tend to look down on people who are alcoholics when they go through the process of recovery they have the opportunity to enter onto a path of growth, a path of integrity and spirituality that… the discipline of which might be compared to a monk in a monastery. 

00:06:05
CHRISTINA GROF Absolutely… absolutely and… and you know people who have no interest in "So called spirituality" or in traditional religions will go through a process of hitting bottom of… of giving up of surrendering and from there, there is nowhere to go but up and a lot of people that I see who are in recovery and have been in recovery for sometime are following a path of recovery that the result of which is an… is an incredibly improved lifestyle, but also a deep wisdom that comes and a… and a deep understanding that is like someone who has been doing a specific spiritual practice for sometimes. 

00:06:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE In your case is a unique one because you were already a rather well known figure in the field of trans-personal psychology before you… you began to enter into the process of recovery from alcoholism. 

00:07:05
CHRISTINA GROF This is true and it was very humiliating for that very reason I thought of myself as trans-personal person I thought of myself as a spiritual person I've been drawn to spirituality ever since I was a child when I became an alcoholic I had a spiritual teacher I was mediating I was… you know I was identified as this devotee as someone on the path and that actually became part of my denial system. You know how could I be a lowly alcoholic, how could I have a problem with this sort of mundane stuff because I was such a spiritual person, but I was a… a very unfortunate alcoholic and had to go through the process of coming in terms with that of hitting bottom, of realizing that I wasn't all that different from anyone else who had my same problem and in that place of… from that place of humiliation, humility to begin to live my life in a much more honest way. What happened was in the process of hitting bottom I… I did have a profound spiritual experience not in a church or a synagogue but in a treatment center and it was what I had been looking for… for very long time it… and so it began to show me immediately that there was this deep connection between the spirituality that I had always sought out and also this yearning inside of me that I had mistakenly filled with alcohol. 

00:08:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… I supposed your case is unique and that there had been so much preparation in terms of the spiritual work you had been doing and then you were able to sort of use the process of recovery from alcoholism in… in combination with that background to… I mean to come to a point where now you are the author of a book about it. 

00:09:10
CHRISTINA GROF Well it was… it was both a help and an obstacle because I had to really become ordinary and you know I had spent a lot of time in kind of… non-ordinary worlds and being interested in the spirit and I had to get right back down to ground zero and then what was very surprising is that in the recovery community there were spiritually based recovery programs and I became familiar with for example the Twelve-Step Programs and I began to realize that something like the Twelve-Steps contains within in it the same wisdom as other spiritual traditions that I've been attracted to. It was in much more ordinary kind of grounded language then a lot of the traditions I've been interested in and there was this a large community of people who had been doing the work who knew how to guide me that I could I ask questions and… and ask for support and it was like coming home. 

00:10:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… In… in other words if we look at Alcoholics Anonymous and other Twelve-Step Programs which are the major programs in western culture that are treating these problems, the cure for alcoholism is a spiritual path. 

00:10:35
CHRISTINA GROF I think so I mean there is reality that people can improve the quality of their life unless they stop doing their addiction. 

00:10:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… 

00:10:40
CHRISTINA GROF So first of all take care of the physical problem and stop the addiction work in a very down to earth way with… with doing that and then once that's kind of establish began to work on. I… I… see… I see addiction as a mosaic that there is the physical, emotional, mental, social and also the spiritual and I think they all need to be addressed in order for successful recovery. So some people will get into their recovery in about four or five years they would begin to under to discover some underlying issues… emotional issues or family issues or abuse issues that they hadn't allowed themselves to feel because of the buffer of their addiction so those need to be tended too. 

00:11:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:11:35
CHRISTINA GROF But then there is also the spiritual and I believe so strongly that unless the spiritual aspect of… of addiction and addiction recovery is addressed that the quality of recovery is really limited. 

00:11:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Thinking Allowed Well I suppose it's very risky when there is so many unique individuals out there struggling with these issues to suggest that one model should fit all. 

00:11:55
CHRISTINA GROF Alright. 

00:12:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And its very presumptuous for… for me or for you or any one to tell somebody who is going through the agonies of… of recovery that oh… this is a spiritual path you are on. 

00:12:10
CHRISTINA GROF Right… right exactly they will say what do you mean spiritual this doesn't feel spiritual you know I'm craving my drug or I'm that's where the wisdom of the community comes in… comes in you know to… to be able to talk regularly and listen regularly to people who have had the experiences who are may be further down the road then… then we are and… and to learn from them and then just keep putting one foot in front of the other I like what the Twelve-Step Program say about one day at a time you know let's just deal with… with this present moment as best we can and then… and then we will see what that tomorrow brings. 

00:12:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well one of the key aspects of the Twelve-Step Program is I understand it is the idea of surrendering to a higher power the understanding of that at the level of the ego we are out of control. 

00:13:00
CHRISTINA GROF Absolutely. 

00:13:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE We… we don't have power over our addiction our addiction has power over us and if we are going to gain mastery of our own lives we have to call upon something larger than what we normally think of ourselves to be. 

00:13:20
CHRISTINA GROF Absolutely and in… in this way it is really not different from … from any other spiritual traditions which require some kind of surrender of the ego. There is a lot of confusion I think with that particular step that of how do I let go you know. I… I remember hearing a… a man saying you know for the last forty years I've been taught in my society that as a man I should be powerful and know you are asking me to become powerless, you know or people who have had a history of abuse or… or oppression in some way who have struggled to kind of gain some sort of power and they someone you know they will say you mean you're asking me to give up the power that I've worked so hard to achieve. The irony is that by stepping aside is an ego that there is a deeper power that's just right there waiting and… and it's that power that people are then able to tap and use in… in their healing and recovery. 

00:14:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And… and I suppose one of other ironies of all of this is that many people find under the influence of alcohol or other drugs that it brings them closer to a kind of, I think you use a term pseudo mystical experience they believe that it gets them in touch with their larger self. They believe that they find God in the bottle somehow. 

00:14:45
CHRISTINA GROF Well this is… this is what William James recognized to be true, what… what Bill Wilson the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous wrote about, this kind of pseudo mystical experience that, what Bill Wilson said is that addicts and alcoholics are… are seekers they want to know about the mysteries of God and… and life, but they made the mistake of looking in the wrong places and that I hear it all the time from people in recovery, you know when I first took my first drink when I took my first drug when I had my first sexual high you know when I first felt that first rush of power that was my first spiritual experience and then I spent the next 10 or 20 or 30 or 40, 50 years trying to recapture that and instead was spun further and further out of control into addiction. 

00:15:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And I suppose if… if one looks closely at all of the spiritual literature one of… one of the pervading themes in every culture is the ability to… to discern a genuine experience from a pseudo experience. 

00:15:55
CHRISTINA GROF Yes I think that's true and unfortunately I think one of the most tragic examples of that is this pseudo addictive, pseudo spiritual experience that you know I've seen so many lives that have been ruined it's… it becomes a very self destructive path when it could be something so… so evolutionary. 

00:16:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE I… I suppose part of the tragedy has been that our culture when people first experience that taste of… of something extraordinary something larger than themselves they… they often don't have a context for it. 

00:16:40
CHRISTINA GROF That's true. 

00:16:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It may never occur to them that what their… their soul is really yearning for maybe a you know a way of life you know a larger sense of being. They may actually think that it… it is the alcohol or it is the particular drug or it is the sexual thrill that… that's creating it. 

00:17:00
CHRISTINA GROF And I think that's true and… and we are quick fix culture you know we want instant gratification at every… at every turn and what this kind of spiritual quest requires is a long term commitment to some sort of spiritual life to some sort of practicing certain set of principles to doing certain kinds of spiritual practice whether it is Twelve-Step practice or Buddhist meditation or Christian prayer and that gradually overtime one's life changes dramatically. 

00:17:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah, I suppose it… it's fair to mention in passing at least that in some ancient societies the rights of Dionysus or the rights of Bacchus you know inebriation, intoxication of… of various kinds were… were integrated into you know a temple an… an ongoing spiritual community. 

00:18:00
CHRISTINA GROF Hmm… hmm… Yeah and I've wondered what is that was different about that culture than about ours and… and it seems to me that in the context that there was a was a mythology there was a kind of cultural understanding and wisdom and support that where these kinds of rituals could be integrated into the community at whole and… and also an understanding that the spiritual experiences something important and valuable. You know I think until the last couple of decades our… our culture lost that. 

00:18:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:18:30
CHRISTINA GROF And… and we have been regaining it very quickly. 

00:18:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE The… the height of our western materialism you know of course there has always been a… a spiritual movement here or there but there is a sense in… in which the culture as a whole was moving towards a… a kind of secular materialism. Spiritual experiences were totally denigrated and… and yet we've always talked about sprits when we drink alcohol. 

00:19:00
CHRISTINA GROF Well that's the thing. Its… it's like we are reaching for the spirits rather than the spirit with the capital S. Another thing that you mentioned Jung's letter to… to Bill Wilson another thing that Jung wrote in that letter was his formula for the treatment of alcoholism was Spiritus Contra Spiritum or the… the use of the Spirit with a capital S against the ravages of the spirits and I believe that is a… a very, even though he was talking about alcoholism that this is a useful formula for any kind of addiction. 

00:19:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE But the… the fundamental principle is if… that if you can discover at the deepest level what we are really yearning for what we are really searching for and… and if we can replace our… our substitute gratifications with something authentic we have a chance of really building a life again on a more solid foundation. 

00:19:55
CHRISTINA GROF I… I absolutely and I… and I… I've heard a lot of people talking about a lot of recovering addicts and others talking about this kind of free floating yearning for something, some missing piece in their lives whatever it would be whether it would be would… would help them to feel alright as though they belong here and unfortunately they tried to… to fill that sense of emptiness or incompleteness in the wrong ways. 

00:20:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… and… and you felt that yourself. 

00:20:25
CHRISTINA GROF Absolutely, yeah. 

00:20:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You went through your recovery and I… I think there is a great irony because here you are already meditating you are already on spiritual path. Could you talk a little more about your process? 

00:20:40
CHRISTINA GROF Well again you know I think that I was certainly involved in my spiritual life, I… I was involved in my spiritual life before I became actively alcoholic and it was during a very chaotic time in that spiritual life that I began to use alcohol as a… as a tranquilizer, really to kind of medicate some of the inner chaos and then became a full-fledged alcoholic. I was in those… in those years beginning. I was kind of addicted to my spirituality in a way using it as a way to escape pain. 

00:21:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:21:15
CHRISTINA GROF Using it as a way to keep myself out of my everyday life in part. 

00:21:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Were there many pitfalls and pathologies amongst people who pursue a so-called spiritual path, that you know there's so many ways that we have of dodging whatever the real issue is for us and… and… and looking good at the same time. 

00:21:35
CHRISTINA GROF Well and I think I was doing some of that. 

00:21:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:35
CHRISTINA GROF I mean I think there was I had also very serious real intent but it wasn't until I hit bottom with my drinking which in a sense was the surrender experience I'd been looking for in another… in another places. To really completely letting go as much as I could at that time and it was then that I discovered a more solid down to earth daily practice and that the spirituality really became more and more integrated into my everyday life, I see spirituality as something that is part of everyday life, not as something that is… is separate. 

00:22:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah, as we use the term spirituality it means so many different things in… in many different context well I suppose in one sense we could strip it from all of it you know cultural baggage and say ultimately what you are dealing with is confronting yourself at a deeper level. 

00:22:35
CHRISTINA GROF Hmm… hmm… 

00:22:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You know we spend so much our daily life filling our time with… with various activities and… and satisfying our attachments and addictions and what it seems to amount to is kind of avoiding something within ourselves perhaps the… that sense of alienation. 

00:23:00
CHRISTINA GROF Yeah I think you are right. The… the spiritual experience or… or spirituality to me has to do with direct experiences that it has to do with an experiences as you say of some deeper source in ourselves and… and possibly also with… in the external… in the external world. 

00:23:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And when you give up an addiction then you are confronted with what it was that was pushing you. 

00:23:30
CHRISTINA GROF Yes and you know this isn't about sitting on the mountain top and… and bliss and why late all the time as you know of the… this spiritual path is very gutsy, is very painful at times, it… it requires a lot of courage a lot of commitment at times that can be… and can be joyful and wonderful in rewarding in the long term. I certainly wouldn't trade any of… any of my path for anything. 

00:24:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… Well. It's wonderful that… that you can say that and I know at the same time you are not encouraging anybody else to follow that. 

00:24:10
CHRISTINA GROF Oh! No… no… no… no I certainly would not recommend and lets emphasize that addiction as a way to find ones… ones spiritual life its… it's too dangerous you know, we… we read in the paper every day the consequences of addiction and… and the number of deaths as a result. So this happened to be my… my path it was something that happened to me and I feel very fortunate to have lived through it and to have gained from it. 

00:24:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You mentioned the humiliation of, in fact you even write about how humiliating even at the time it was to spend the days with… with your spiritual teacher and then come home at night and start drinking. 

00:24:55
CHRISTINA GROF Yeah. 

00:24:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE An interesting thing you wrote about was the sense in which people often confuse low self-esteem and… and a kind of humiliating self image with… with spiritual humility. 

00:25:10
CHRISTINA GROF Yes, well I think… I think that so-called spiritual humility the sort of pseudo spiritual humility can be a cover for low self-esteem or sense of shame. You know someone whose focusing constantly on… on other people you know it don't think about me you know I'll… I'll… I'll take the smallest piece. I do… I'll spend my life taking care of you and devoted to you that there… there is a truly selfless spiritual aspect to that, but I think also there is a shadow side of that where people can use their spirituality or use that sense of humiliation… humility to cover… to cover low self-esteem. 

00:26:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah well it's so subtle what we are taking about you… you know the very word spirit I guess ultimately it means the essence the inner most part and its always subtle and its is always seems to be that whenever you think you understand some… something true about spirituality is always the dark side the… the ridiculous the perverted side of their very same understanding. 

00:26:30
CHRISTINA GROF Well I sometimes seems to have this kind of strange sense of humor there is both… both the… the very clear light side and then there is also this kind of a… a dark side that you know I think it helps to maintain a sense of humor and just keep… keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

00:26:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well Christina Grof you… you have been very courageous in sharing with the public at large the agonizing journey that you have gone through in recovering from your own addiction, courageous both because of the suffering and also because you are already you know a public figure in… in high esteem at… at the time. I really appreciate you sharing that with me. 

00:27:10
CHRISTINA GROF Thank you… thank you Jeffery. 

00:27:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE With our audience. Thanks for being with me. 

00:27:15
CHRISTINA GROF It was a real pleasure, thank you. 

00:27:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And thank you for being with us.

JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome I'm Jeffery Mishlove, our topic today is spiritual crisis, with me is Christina Groff who is the author of the Thirst for Wholeness. Christina is also the co-creator of Holotropic Breathwork and the founder of the spiritual emergence network with her husband Dr. Stanislav Groff she has authored several books including Spiritual Emergency, The Stormy Search For Self and Beyond Death. Welcome Christina. 

00:28:30
CHRISTINA GROF Thank you Jeffery. 

00:28:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It is a pleasure to be here with you. 

00:28:30
CHRISTINA GROF It's real pleasure to be here. 

00:28:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Spiritual Emergency or Spiritual Crisis in… in many ways it's… it's a relatively new term in… in… in our modern vernacular, now because of your efforts quite widely used but I suppose one can say a historically speaking in… in medieval times and ancient times it is well understood that there were crisis along the spiritual path or crisis of awakening. 

00:29:00
CHRISTINA GROF Yes and I think anyone who is familiar with the lives of the mystics or the saints or even the life of Jesus of… of some of the of… of Mohamed that there were these… these dark times that walks in the desert the… the difficulties, the struggle, the wrestling with the divine. That appear in… in many different lives and what I've come to understand is that this is a very common part of the spiritual path, it might not be as extreme as some of the… the statements of the… in the lives of the saints, but for everyone who seriously embarks on a spiritual path there times of walking through the desert as well as times… as times of… of great reward. 

00:29:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well of course there can be times of soul searching, times of doubt, but when you talk about spiritual crisis often there is a physical component to this. 

00:30:00
CHRISTINA GROF Yes I'd like to talk about both spiritual emergence and spiritual emergency. Spiritual emergence is a natural capability of every human being to emerge into their spiritual selves, to emerge out of the sense of limitation as an individual into a more expanded sense of self and this… this kind of spiritual identity gives scared underpinnings to… to a person's life and so spiritual emergence can happen easily for some people they might not even notice that, that it's happening you know after a period of 5 or 10 years they look back and say you know I've really have changed. Spiritual Emergency is something else this is spiritual crisis this is a time when the experiences when the physical states that you mention when the insights come very rapidly and a… a person sometimes in that… in that situation has trouble coping with everyday life. For a while may even need to step away from some of their daily responsibilities to pay attention or to give attention to this inner process that's become very… very overwhelming. 

00:31:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It… it seems ironic in a sense that on the one hand you one might say that a life in which every moment feels blessed and joyful might be considered the natural state of human being and… on the other hand we sure sometimes have to go through an awful lot to allow ourselves to have that. 

00:31:35
CHRISTINA GROF While this is true, wouldn't it be nice if this… if this kind of a happy natural state were… were always available but I think from what I've seen a lot of it has to do with ego, with resistances with an unwillingness to open to… to our true potential for whatever reason, self doubt, a sense that we are you know we might not deserve what it is that is trying to… to happen and… and many other… other reasons. 

00:32:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE There's… there's a whole energetic phenomenon associated with it in the Hindu tradition its sometimes referred to as the rising of the… of the Kundalini the… the coiled serpent energy at the base of the spine that rises up and activates the chakras the various centers of psychic awareness along the way and this is sometimes affecting your experience can be a very disruptive, even painful process. 

00:32:35
CHRISTINA GROF Very disruptive when the Kundalini awakening is… is the context that… that I've been able to… to put all of my many of my experiences into… in order to… to understand it. It was the metaphor that… that works for me. when it started… it's started for me with the birth of my first child. So there I was in a hospital you know lying on my back giving birth and suddenly this enormous spiritual force got going in me. I didn't know it was a spiritual force at the time, it felt like being out of control, I felt like there were a lot tremors, a lot strange breathing that started to happen kind of… in spite of my best intentions and I was both very excited and very frightened by what was going on, it certainly was not what they had taught us about in Lamaze child birth preparation. And that's how it began I have spoken with other woman whether this is true, this is not the only place that the Kundalini awakening. 

00:33:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well and… and of course child birth is I… I think by every account about as closest one can imagine in many ways to a scared experiences. 

00:33:50
CHRISTINA GROF Well it is, and it is also can be a kind of physical emotional emergency in a way. I mean it's… it's… it's a tremendous point of stress and we have found out in our… in our research into spiritual emergency that very frequently when this process gets going and people whether it's a Kundalini experience or some other form of spiritual awakening it's at a time of stress or time of loss emotional or physical stress and may be when a person has a disease or has just had an accident or is grieving a loss of a job or… or a maid or a parent then this awakening can… can start and as you say it… it has very physical form sometimes. 

00:34:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah, I guess it seems to me there is a real delicate line between the kind of experiences that occurs in… in which you can say to myself oh! this is horrible, I'm really suffering but I know there is a lesson in here for me I can learn from this and when I'm finally on the other side of it I will be a larger, wiser person, as supposed to the kind of experience where you say "My God I'm really suffering I just can't wait till it ends" and there is… there is no lesson, the only hope is to end the suffering. 

00:35:15
CHRISTINA GROF Well and I think you can feel both of those things at different stages in a spiritual emergence or emergency situation because sometimes there is a sense of such hopelessness that it you lose the perspective this is a lesson and that I'm going to come out of this a different. A… a lot of times that will happen around what… what we call the ego death experience where everything feels as though its dying and what's happening in… in that kind of experiences is it all of the old structures, all of the old ways of being, the unsuccessful ways of being are coming to an end and it feels literally as oh this is it and in that place it's a… it's a real sense of… of hope… hopelessness and despair. Again another irony is that if a person is able to open up to that experiences to be there with the experience that just on that another side of despair and hopelessness and dying is a… is a whole new way of being. 

00:36:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE It reminds me of I think one of the accounts of the crucifixion in which Christ's last words are said to be "My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me" 

00:36:25
CHRISTINA GROF Yes. 

00:36:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Right before the resurrection. 

00:36:30
CHRISTINA GROF Yes and actually when I was involved in my own spiritual emergency here is which were… which were about… it was about 12 years of… of real kind of emergency difficulty in… inner chaos I thought a lot about "My God, My God why hast thou forsaken me" in various stages, it felt as though whatever resources I had previously had… had disappeared and yet when I could… when I could surrender to that stage and say okay I don't know what else to do take me. Then right on the other side of that was all kinds of spiritual help and… and nourishment. 

00:37:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well there are some people in the psychological psychiatric community people I suppose such as R.D. Laing or Arnold Mindell who had maintained that every crisis is… is a kind of spiritual process through… through which we grow. Every… every potential psychotic episode, do you subscribe to that view. 

00:37:35
CHRISTINA GROF Well I mean I think you can see it from all many different perspectives you know there is the kind of the… the very general perspective which is this is all a spiritual crisis. You know the whole life process is a …is one long spiritual crisis or one long spiritual path if you want to call it that. When my husband and I began to focus on the area of spiritual emergency we… we put some frame work on it for, because for practical reason, so that we could distinguish, what is this? We would call a spiritual emergency a… a crisis of… of being in a sense and what is true mental illness? What is a psychotic experience? 

00:38:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:38:25
CHRISTINA GROF And we in talking about spiritual emergency never wanted to say there is no such thing as mental illness. So… so for the practical purposes we try to distinguish between the two and a lot of that has to do with the style or the… the attitude with which the person is treating the experiences. 

00:38:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE The person who is having the experiences. 

00:38:50
CHRISTINA GROF Yes. 

00:38:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE In other words that are some existential choice in all of this, even a schizophrenic could make a commitment to turning it into an spiritual experience of some kind. 

00:39:00
CHRISTINA GROF Well there is… there is a, I'll tell you the… the difference and styles that we would distinguish, somebody who is willing to somehow see this as an inner… an inner process, who you know may have a great difficulty at times turning in you know going with the process but still by and large you know we'll say to you there is something really powerful happening to me these are the experiences I'm having you know I feel like I've may be lived before or… or that I'm connected with this source of energy or and I'm having all kinds of mythological kinds of experiences, have you ever heard of this, you know how do I… how do I work with this, it's a very different attitude than someone who is externalizing it all you know it's not… it's not about them in any way it's about the external world, they are paranoid they, you know its about the… the CIA and the person who is bugging their home and… 

00:40:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah, in… in other words I suppose in the… in the… in the most pragmatic of terms some people are very responsive to treating their conditions as a spiritual emergency and others are simply not. 

00:40:10
CHRISTINA GROF Well I think so and I have talked with many people who have had a… a so-called spiritual emergency in a real crisis situations were they were… they were scared their family were scared they went to local hospital or the… or the local psychiatrist and were admitted into a psychiatric ward. And they… they told me even though they… they received all kinds of psychiatric labels or drugs that something in them knew that this was… this was not mental illness, that this was something else that they and… and that after they got out of… of the hospital that they continue to treat it in some way as a… as a opportunity for self-exploration. 

00:40:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE I suppose that already requires a certain level of self-esteem that not everybody has. 

00:41:05
CHRISTINA GROF Yeah, I don't know if its self-esteem or whether its just that there is… there is an… 

00:41:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE An intuition. 

00:41:10
CHRISTINA GROF An intuition or, yes a kind of experiential quality to it that if they are able to somehow hang in there and stay with the process that they… they are in the process of some monumental change in their lives. 

00:41:25
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well I suppose on the one hand we might get people who are having a genuine spiritual crisis who become misdiagnosed as a… as a schizophrenic put in a hospital and… and given a lot of drugs to suppress their symptoms rather than to work through them and perhaps on the other hand you… you may have people who are experiencing for all intense a… a psychotic break who end up in the hands of a trans-personal therapist who… who tell them oh… this is a spiritual awakening you are so fortunate and… and they never quite are able to work to… to cope. 

00:42:00
CHRISTINA GROF Well I… I think this… this I mean both of these things exist, what I would like to… to see and what I think is already been happening is that the person in that situation has a choice. 

00:42:10
CHRISTINA GROF Yes. 

00:42:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE You know, if they come to the doctor or the therapist and say I just want something that's going to make please go away, you know I don't want to deal with it give me something to then may be the best indication is… is tranquillizers in the hospitalization, but if the person really sees it as an inner process wants to work with it wants guidance through it wants support may be not… may be without medication and… and psychiatric intervention and that… that should be also available to that person. What would be necessary in that situation would be some kind of a therapist or… or psychiatrist with a broad enough conceptual understanding that if there is an intense spiritual experiences or archetypal or mythological experience that they would be able to… to support that. 

00:43:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And fortunately there are more and more. 

00:43:05
CHRISTINA GROF Fortunately there are more and more. 

00:43:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Of… of these people. Well you mentioned that you spent 12 years struggling with a… a spiritual emergency that fit the Kundalini model can we talk more about some of the details of what that was really like from the inside. 

00:43:25
CHRISTINA GROF Well let me say something about the Kundalini, you mentioned that… that the yogi see the… the Kundalini the spiritual energy as feminine, that it is available to all people, that it lies dormant in… in all people and that through spiritual practice or through contact with a teacher or… or just spontaneously that suddenly this sleeping spiritual energy can be released through the system and it travels through the system kind of cleansing opening the person to their spiritual self. 

00:44:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:44:00
CHRISTINA GROF And it sounds very simple but it can be very demanding… 

00:44:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:44:05
CHRISTINA GROF …When that happens. For me I think that when this Kundalini process got going I was very blocked I was very resistant there were… there was a lot of cleaning how to do, and… and I was scared and so I kind of dug my heels and… and resisted… resisted the experiences much more than I wish I had and I think that's part of what it made so difficult. I had wonderful support through it but it was just my own… my own resistance that… that made it difficult. There were lot of physical pains, in different parts of my body it was almost as though as the… as the spiritual force that Kundalini was hitting against different areas trying to open it up that it would result in pains of different kinds, temporary blindness for a while strange eye problems and headaches. 

00:45:10
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Times at which I think you described it as if you felt you might be dying. 

00:45:15
CHRISTINA GROF Yes, yes it felt sometimes as though and… and really in a lot of ways the old Christina was dying the… the part of me that… that wasn't operating successfully in the world was dying, the limited materialistic part of me was dying to in order to open up to a much broader sense of who I… who I was. 

00:45:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE And of course I'm sure there were concerns that maybe you were really physical ill. 

00:45:40
CHRISTINA GROF Oh yes and my strategy was that I would go to the doctor if ever I was concerned and I would not say I'm involving in the Kundalini awakening but I'd say here… here are the symptoms I'm having and I get the tests and you know find out what I didn't have and then I would they never did find anything. 

00:46:00
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:46:00
CHRISTINA GROF And then I would work with that, with the process. There were also… there were also emotional surges the people who write about the Kundalini talk about the physical krias or the physical releases there were also emotional releases, so suddenly as kind of a… a pocket of anger or fear or shame would open up those would come into consciousness and I would have to work with those kind of process them, so it's a real I see it as a kind of purging process. 

00:46:40
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yet some of the traditions I think talk about the 10,000 visions that can occur back and forth between heaven and hell. 

00:46:45
CHRISTINA GROF Oh yes and I certainly had my share of those. 

00:46:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… With the classical antidote into the… into the agonies of the Kundalini is… is discipline, a spiritual discipline a yoga practice. 

00:47:00
CHRISTINA GROF Well and I talked with various spiritual teachers during… during this chaos because I found that when I was in the middle of this there were all kinds of… of… of tremors and visions and which kept me from being able to do a sitting mediation practice for example or something very focused and disciplined and the answers I got were that maybe it was important for a while, while it was very… while it was very disruptive to suspend that kind of a discipline and instead the discipline became to… to surrender to whatever it was that I was given in a… on a particular day. 

00:47:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Just surrender to your own inner process. 

00:47:45
CHRISTINA GROF And… and the spiritual practice was… was waiting right there for me when… when the process itself calm down enough so that I could start focusing again. 

00:47:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well I suppose if we step back for a moment and look at what is spiritual practice what is yoga, there are many different facets of it and certainly at one time in your life you… you can't practice them all the… the postures, the meditations, it is just one part of… of yoga another part is a kind of surrender and opening of the heart. 

00:48:20
CHRISTINA GROF Hmm… hmm… Well and I think… I think it requires a certain flexibility to be able to respond to wherever one is in… in the process. For me it was very important to have some good guidance. 

00:48:35
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:48:35
CHRISTINA GROF To have some teachers along the way who knew about this process who could reassure me tell me I was fine in fact this, you know this wasn't craziness that this was in fact a spiritual awakening that was going on and then to give me some… some ideas about what to do next. 

00:48:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… And some that point there is a question of taking it a day at a time. 

00:48:55
CHRISTINA GROF Exactly, exactly, one of my big mistakes was that I began to medicate myself with alcohol and I've talked with other people were… were this has been the same the same story. And so that I severely compromised what could have you know this… this awakening for a number of years there but. 

00:49:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE In other words we… we did talk in an earlier segment about alcoholism and its relationship to the spiritual path now we are at a point were partially what you are saying is that in… in your case the… the development of alcoholism was in… in response to the Kundalini arising, it was so intense you felt the need to find a way to tranquilize yourself. 

00:49:45
CHRISTINA GROF Yes what imparts you know there… there were certainly other… other aspects to my alcoholism but definitely that was a major factor. 

00:49:50
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm… So now we are at an interesting point because there is a sense in which the antidote to alcoholism and the antidote to Kundalini begin to where interpenetrate each other. 

00:50:05
CHRISTINA GROF Hmm… hmm… Yes as we said in the earlier program my strong belief is that one of the major antidotes to addiction is some kind of spiritual path, some kind of spiritual life as… as well as doing the other… the other aspects of recovery and for me that the real turning point in my spiritual life was coming into recovery from my addiction and it was… it's been a continuation of the Kundalini process, somehow with that surrender at the bottom of my drinking career a lot of the chaos of the Kundalini settle down, quieted down, smooth out and now that force is available to me in other ways in creativity for example. 

00:50:55
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well I suppose it didn't have to be alcohol, but its seems as if what your are saying is that sometimes when you are going through a pitch of… of awakening and especially in the context of our modern culture with all of its stimulation and possibilities that in order to really find our core we need to or we often do at least go through major crisis or bring ourselves to major crisis. 

00:51:25
CHRISTINA GROF Well I think that… I think that is true and so how do we handle that is I think one of the all important questions is there support, do we have people we can go to… to talk about this, because in the middle of it… its very confusing and… and it you know I think people need… need to reach out at that point, part of my work in the area of spiritual emergency has been to try in some way to provide that support this is why I found the spiritual Emergence Networking, that's why I've worked hard to try to… to have network of centers where people can go and to go through the critical periods of their… of their spiritual emergency. 

00:52:05
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Center is I guess that can combine psychological, emotional knowledge, medical knowledge and spiritual knowledge. 

00:52:15
CHRISTINA GROF Absolutely yes, yes I mean in…in some ways the best of addiction treatment centers can… can serve as prototypes for centers for spiritual emergency. The emphasis is of course would be somewhat different, but you know there have been some very good residential treatment centers for addiction treatment and I think some of the lessons that the addiction treatment people have learned can now be applied to… to those working in the area of spiritual emergency. 

00:52:45
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Yeah, of course fundamental is as we pointed out in our previous interview to the recovery process in the Twelve-Step Program is the notion of we surrender to a higher power and that seems to be pretty much part of the spiritual path of every culture. 

00:53:00
CHRISTINA GROF Yes, in the spiritual emergency in… in the Kundalini awakening to try to get the ego out of the way step aside and allow this deeper spiritual power which is also a part of who we are, to… to emerge. 

00:53:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Each tradition seems to give it a different label it would be the Athma in… in the Hindu tradition or your spirit guides in a western esoteric tradition or… or your higher self in a… in a trans-personal psychology tradition or… 

00:53:30
CHRISTINA GROF And the Holy Spirit. 

00:53:30
JEFFERY MISHLOVE The Holy Spirit or Jesus or I mean we have many, many languages for this many, many, cultural contexts but what you are saying when you talk about a spiritual context is… is to see the common ground in all of those. 

00:53:50
CHRISTINA GROF Yes and… and there have been many, many cultures throughout history who recognized spiritual crisis who have seen it as absolutely part of the… part of the path you know the… some of the wise elders are the ones who have been through that process who can then… then help to guide and support other people who have gone through it and I think our culture has opened up to… to that need and its responding. 

00:54:15
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Well it is amazing the way our culture seems to be responding to the spiritual thirst. 

00:54:20
CHRISTINA GROF Yes. 

00:54:20
JEFFERY MISHLOVE Christina Grof what a pleasure.
