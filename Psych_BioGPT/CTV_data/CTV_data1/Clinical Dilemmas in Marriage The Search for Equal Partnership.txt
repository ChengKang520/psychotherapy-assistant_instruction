BETTY CARTER  Couples marry with so much hope for the future. They imagine the unique marriages they'll make. Marriages that would be different from their parents and better in important ways. 

00:00:45

00:00:45
BETTY CARTER  But in fact, half of all marriages in this country end in divorce. 

00:01:00
CLINICAL DILEMMAS IN MARRIAGE: THE SEARCH FOR EQUAL PARTNERSHIP WITH BETTY CARTER, MSW DIRECTOR, FAMILY INSTITUTE OF WESTCHESTER WRITTEN BY BETTY CARTER, MSW AND STEPHEN LERNER, PHD BETTY CARTER, MSW 

00:01:00
BETTY CARTER  The high rate of divorce today tells us that we need to examine the institution of marriage itself and not just focus on the problems of particular spouses that come to us for help. Now, what has changed in the broader culture and in the lives of men and women that might help to explain this high frequency of divorce. While it's hard to generalize, of course, socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial lines, several major changes have come together over the past few decades. These changes require us to rethink the very meaning of marriage and the meaning of divorce as well. These changes are: vastly increased numbers of women in the workforce, the availability of reliable methods of contraception and abortion, increased longevity, a profound challenge to gender roles. The greater economic power of middle class women today makes it less likely that they were myriad of economic necessity or stay in an unrewarding marriage. The availability of contraception and legal, safe abortions opens the possibility of few children, no children or plan spacing of children. This allows pursuits in addition to or other than child rearing to be the focus of a marriage. The average couple that is not divorced during the child raising years can now expect to spend an additional 20 years together after the last child leaves home. This often creates a late midlife crisis in which the terms of the marriage need to be renegotiated. Many women are challenging gender roles in marriage, rejecting the age-old assumption that they alone will take care of children, the elderly and the ill to all of the emotional work and all the housework as well. Today, many couples marry with a wish to form a new kind of partnership based on fairness but the institution of marriage carries with it a long legacy of profound inequality between men and women. A legacy reinforced by economic and political arrangements, the structure of the workplace, and multi-generational family traditions. In order for marriage to become more satisfying for both partners and as a result more likely to endure, we all need to find ways of fostering the search for equal partnership. By equal partnership, I mean a marriage in which both spouses flexibly address and divide up family responsibilities without an excessive load falling on either partner. The equal partner marriage supports the husband as a full participant in the emotional life of the family. It also supports the wife's need to define personal goals and promotes her full participation in economic decision making and income production. In this video, I will first introduce the model that I used to assess the marital relationship. I call this model the multi-contextual framework. I will then show two brief clinical vignettes illustrating the approaches I've developed to help couples whose marriage is run aground as their partnerships became unworkable. I will focus primarily on the interrelated issues of gender, money, and power. These issues tend to remain invisible in therapy partly because spouses don't typically bring them up as the source of marital tension, that they do not is itself a reflection of the fact that society doesn't acknowledge their enormous importance. Another reason these topics have remained invisible is that most of us therapist have not carefully examined them in our own marital and family relationships. As a result, many of us conduct therapy as if women and men come to us or to their marriages for that matter as equals. We then conceptualize treatment as if the disparities empower stemming from financial inequality and gender prescriptions don't exist. The work I will present here illustrates what happens when I bring these issues out into the open. 

00:06:20
BETTY CARTER  Before I show you the first clinical example, I want to present the multi-contextual framework with which I assess a particular marriage using three overlapping lenses. I picture the stuff of marriage and family life as a fabric woven of many colored threads. Lens number one is the family life cycle context. This lens reveals the normative problems, stresses, and tasks facing the marriage at each stage of the life cycle. The first stage is the young adult leaving home, the second stage is becoming a couple- 

00:07:10
HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE 

00:07:10
BETTY CARTER - actually 90 percent of adults eventually marry while 10 percent remain single. A significant number of adults somewhere between five and 12 percent are gay or lesbian and many of them also form couples. The third stage is the family with young children. The fourth is the family with adolescent children. The fifth stage is launching the children and moving on again as a couple. The sixth stage, the elderly couple. Forty-nine percent of all marriages end in divorce. 

00:08:00
DIVORCE: 49% OF FIRST MARRIAGES 

00:08:00
BETTY CARTER Seventy percent remarry. 

00:08:05
DIVORCE: 70-75% REMARRY 

00:08:05
BETTY CARTER And 64 percent of this re-divorce. 

00:08:05
DIVORCE: 64% OF 2ND MARRIAGES 

00:08:05
BETTY CARTER  Lens number two is the multi-generational context. This lens reveals the patterns, problems, and issues that each spouse brings to the marriage from the family of origin. This may include marital patterns, losses, taboos, themes, family secrets, physical abuse, incest or substance abuse. 

00:08:40
[sil.] 

00:08:40
BETTY CARTER  Lens number three is the socio-cultural context. This lens reveals both the resources and the inequities that flow into the marriage from the social system in which it is embedded. Lens number three will include gender, race, culture, class, sexual orientation, and physical ability. The socio-cultural context tells us what it means to be a man or woman in this place, at this time for a member of this particular social group. This is the lens that has been missing in family therapy until very recently. And this is where we will focus on in this video. Now, I will show some aspects of my work with two White couples with varied ethnic backgrounds. One is middle class and the second upper-middle class. Both live in New York and have higher than average incomes but also face an unusually high cost of living. My goal here is to highlight my interventions in the areas of gender, money, and power. Many other parts of the client's story and of the work are therefore omitted. I hope that you will find these illustrations thought-provoking. Now let's meet Anna and Don our first couple. 

00:10:20
BETTY CARTER Okay, so why don't, why don't you each tell me what brings you here. I, I really wanna hear from both of you, either one of you can go first. 

00:10:30
DON Well, she can go first 'coz ah, this was her idea. 

00:10:30
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:10:30
ANNA  Well, uhm, I'm just really fed up... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
ANNA ...at this point and I just feel like all we do is argue. We hardly we see each other but when we see each other all we do is argue. Uhm, over everything, little things, the kids, the house uhm, I just feel like I'm trying to joggle too many things and I'm just really overwhelmed and I try to explain to Donald that I need him to be home more and, I understand that he has to work but I'm working also and try to take care of the house and try to take care of two children and I'm just fed up. I, I just can't keep running on this treadmill without something snapping. 

00:11:10
DON But it's not like I don't help with the kids. 

00:11:15
ANNA I know. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DON I mean I'm, I'm there a lot... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
ANNA I'm not saying you do not. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DON ...but I, I'm on the road a lot. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
ANNA I know. 

00:11:15
DON I do a lot of traveling. Ah. 

00:11:20
ANNA We discuss at the same thing over and over. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
ANNA  And we just can't seem to get to some kind of solution that uhm, that'll work. You know, sometimes I think this isn't just gonna work out uhm, between us. I've, I've thought of divorce. I'm that fed up. 

00:11:35
BETTY CARTER  Now, let's look at Anna and Don's marriage through the three lenses of the multi-contextual framework. Where are they on the continuum of the family life cycle? 

00:11:50
LENS #1 CONTEXT 

00:11:50
BETTY CARTER Anna and Don have recently had their second child. They're in the stage of the family with young children. The presenting problem for Anna and Don as it often is for couples with young children largely centers on the disposition of child care responsibilities- 

00:12:10
HOME CHORES VERSUS OUTSIDE WORK 

00:12:10
BETTY CARTER - and household chores when both parents work. These demands have fallen disproportionately upon Anna, as if she is suppose to work a second shift each day in addition to her outside job. 

00:12:25
DILEMMAS OF PARENTING 

00:12:25
BETTY CARTER  Also, as Anna and Don try to improve upon the ways in which they were parented, their anxiety and conflict have intensify. 

00:12:35
INTIMACY VERSUS FAMILY DEMANDS 

00:12:35
BETTY CARTER  These struggles typically lead to an erosion of the couple's intimacy. 

00:12:45
LENS #2 MULTI-GENERATIONAL CONTEXT 

00:12:45
BETTY CARTER What other legacy is from each of their family's of origin pertaining to their presenting problem. Anna's father was born in Poland and her mother in Ireland. They married in England and came to this country in 1955. Anna is the oldest of six children. Her parents divorced in 1984. Her father remarried twice producing his seventh child in the second marriage, her mother did not remarry. Don is the third of four, the only son with two older sisters and one younger sister. His mother's parents were born in Argentina and emigrated to this country in 1952. His father, born here, is of German and Irish descent. Anna's mother worked as a nurse until Anna was born. After the birth of their children, Anna and Don's mothers both became full time homemakers. Both fathers made all of the money. His father was a salesman who returned each week with small gifts for the children. On weekends, he took over the kitchen involving the kids in the cooking. Anna's parents were divorced and her father divorced the second time. Anna's mother regretted giving up her work especially in light of her subsequent divorce. She encourages Anna not to give up her job. What forces from the socio-cultural sphere are relevant to this couple? 

00:14:35
LENS #3 SOCIO-CULTURAL CONTEXT 

00:14:35
BETTY CARTER Anna's preferred solution to their life situation is to work part-time but her employer insist that her particular job must be full-time. She wants Don to do less traveling on his job but he worries that he'll be past over for promotion if he rocks the boat. His preferred solution is that Anna stay home full-time like his mother did but current economic realities required two paychecks to maintain their middle-class lifestyle. Anna always dreamed of going to college but her working class immigrant parents discouraged advanced education especially for daughters. As her marriage became increasingly strained, Anna wondered about divorce. She knows several women who left their marriages and she has watch them struggle to get by financially. This concludes our brief assessment of Anna and Don's marriage using the multi-contextual framework. Now, I will show excerpt from my work with this couple illustrating ways in which three crucial but often neglected issues can be brought into marital therapy. The amount and control of the couple's money. The seemingly unchangeable, unquestionable arrangements of the man's work schedule. The expectation that the wife will share responsibility for earning income and the husband will participate fully in the children's lives and in household responsibilities. Now, let's rejoin the first session. 

00:16:25
BETTY CARTER Before we go any further, let me just get a few facts here to help give me some background, okay? Before we talk anymore about the, the difficulties. Ah, what, what year were the two of you married? 

00:16:40
ANNA Ah, '83. 

00:16:40
BETTY CARTER 1983. And how old are you each? 

00:16:45
DON I'm 34. 

00:16:45
BETTY CARTER Thirty-four. 

00:16:45
ANNA Thirty-three. 

00:16:45
BETTY CARTER And Anna, 33. And how old are the kids? 

00:16:50
ANNA Five and. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
BETTY CARTER  The oldest is? 

00:16:55
ANNA Five. 

00:16:55
BETTY CARTER A boy or a girl? 

00:16:55
ANNA A girl. 

00:16:55
BETTY CARTER A girl, 5. And the younger one? 

00:17:00
ANNA Sixteen months. 

00:17:00
BETTY CARTER Is that a little boy? 

00:17:00
ANNA Yes. 

00:17:00
BETTY CARTER Sixteen months. So, you've got nothing to do in your spare time huh? (laughs) And what kind of work exactly does each of you do? 

00:17:10
ANNA Ah, I'm an office manager. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
ANNA it's a full-time job. 

00:17:15
BETTY CARTER An office manager? 

00:17:15
ANNA Yeah. 

00:17:15
BETTY CARTER And how much do you make at that, what's your income on that Anna? (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
ANNA Ah, 26,000. 

00:17:20
BETTY CARTER Twenty-six thousand. Okay. And ah, you work what? Nine to five or? (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
ANNA Yeah. 

00:17:25
BETTY CARTER Okay. And Don how about you? What ah, what kind of work do you do? You mentioned ah, selling. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
DON I sell refrigenat, ah, refrigeration equipment... (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:17:35
DON ...to supermarkets ah, I work for Northway Corporation. 

00:17:35
BETTY CARTER I see. 

00:17:40
DON And uhm, I make ah, 35,000 a year. 

00:17:40
BETTY CARTER Thirty-five. Okay, so that's like more or less $60,000 let's say? 

00:17:45
DON Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
ANNA Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
BETTY CARTER Ah, between the two of you. So with the couple of kids in today's economy that doesn't leave you with a lot leftover I would imagine. 

00:17:55
ANNA No. 

00:17:55
BETTY CARTER And yet, Don you mentioned earlier that you'd prefer that Anna give up her job and stay home full-time. And Anna, you seem to nod in agreement as if you thought that could be an okay solution. Suppose God forbid, you know, ah, Don left you. Suppose you've been mumbling about divorce, suppose one day you got so fed up you really did it and you had quit your job. What would you do for money? He's shaking his head over there. What would you do for money? 

00:18:30
ANNA Well. (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
DON  She probably, she probably get alimony and swallow what she did(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
BETTY CARTER Well, if you can swallow. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
DON But that's a big hypothetical, I think it's. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
BETTY CARTER Okay, but, but I, I bet a lot of women do think. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
DON  Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
BETTY CARTER Yes, they, they do it on alimony or a child support. So, fasten your seatbelt for another statistic. Sorry to do this to you but 50 percent of divorced women never see a child support check and many of them are on welfare. Now, of course, I understand you feel, you wouldn't, you wouldn't be like that should you get divorce you wouldn't do that. But I'm just telling you what's happening in the country. 

00:19:10
DON Oh, I, I don't, I don't see how were gonna, we should have to end up like that but, (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
BETTY CARTER No I, I don't either. 

00:19:15
DON but if. (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
BETTY CARTER But it's just the half of marriages do... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
DON Yeah. 

00:19:20
BETTY CARTER ...so this is what I'm really talking about, is this big picture... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
DON Yeah. 

00:19:25
BETTY CARTER ...half of this people do. Anna what would you do? 

00:19:25
ANNA  I have no idea what I would do and just having to say that I, I, I don't like that feeling. 

00:19:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
ANNA I don't like feeling that I have no option. 

00:19:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Ah, wha, what exactly did you mean there? What's, what's that feeling like? 

00:19:45
ANNA Oh, it feels like I have no say. Uh-huh, In terms of how we spend or what decisions we make about, what were going to uhm, buy or do or how often we can go away things like that. 

00:19:55
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
ANNA It, It feels very powerless. 

00:20:00
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. You mean you're afraid that if you want to earn your money that you really wouldn't have... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ANNA Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
BETTY CARTER ...that much role in the decision making. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
ANNA Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
BETTY CARTER  And now, if you can wave a wand and you didn't have to worry about the money part of it, you could make any solution you wanted to this stress juggling problem. What, what would you choose? 

00:20:20
ANNA Well, I think maybe if I could alleviate some of the stress at work and I give it up completely but maybe cut down to maybe three days a week or... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
ANNA ...less hours since it still due five days... (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:20:30
ANNA ...that I will feel less pressured at work and it would be less of a, a chaotic thing when I got home. 

00:20:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
ANNA Uhm. 

00:20:40
BETTY CARTER Well, actually that sounds very sensible ah, why, why not, I mean why don't you try them? 

00:20:45
ANNA Well, part of it is, you know, I need to work enough hours to make enough to cover the child care... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ANNA ...while I'm at work. So... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:20:50
ANNA ...if I cut down too far then it, it's like why bother? Uhm, the other thing that I worry about is, is, we have money now for us to occasionally go out and do things and I... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
ANNA ...think that without that extra money that will be one of the things I would go and we would miss out a lot... (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
DON I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't like it that out. 

00:21:10
ANNA ...of time without the kids. 

00:21:10
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:21:10
ANNA  So it's hard. 

00:21:15
BETTY CARTER So really ah, you're afraid of risking the time that the two of you have. (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
ANNA Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DON Hmm. Were not fighting all the time. 

00:21:20
several months later 

00:21:20
BETTY CARTER  So, Anna you're down to three days a week now at work, is that right? 

00:21:35
ANNA Yes. And now I think Donald is really start thinking about ways that he can maybe cut down on some of the travels that he does so that he can be home more. 

00:21:40
BETTY CARTER  Well, first, let's find out if that's what he wants to do, you know, where are you at with that Don? What ah, is that something that you'd like to do not thinking for just a minute about whether you can or whether the money works out, but just about what you'd like to do. 

00:22:00
DON Well, I, I'd like to be able to spend more times with my kids to, one thing abou, about my father. There's a lot of times he was so busy from work or so tired that he wasn't able to spend a lot of time with us. 

00:22:15
BETTY CARTER Did your father ever ah, miss any important event in your life because of being on the road, you know, a game or school functions. (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
DON (sighs) I can remember back in ah, when I was in the little league that ah, there were times that ah, a lot of times that, when he was not able to come to the games ah, because he was on the road or too... 

00:22:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
DON ...tired for being on the road. 

00:22:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
DON Ah, my mother was there with, with my three sisters but, but he wasn't there. 

00:22:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. And how did your mother react to his ah, travel. I mean to the amount that he traveled. How did she, what did she have to say about it? 

00:22:45
DON She seemed to ah, put up with it. I wouldn't say she was happy about it. Ah it's, of course, she seemed to, to work harder while he was ah, away. 

00:22:55
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
DON Ah, but she, she wasn't happy about it. 

00:23:00
BETTY CARTER Did she complained to him or did she ah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DON  Uhm. Well. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
BETTY CARTER ...ask him to do anything about it or. 

00:23:05
DON  Not, not that I heard. Ah, I, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
DON ...she just sort of ah, this was sort of ah, just the way things were. 

00:23:15
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
DON And ah. (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
BETTY CARTER She was sort of resigned to it. 

00:23:20
DON Right. 

00:23:20
BETTY CARTER Don, do you think that your father got lonely, you know, spending night after night in, in one motel or another? 

00:23:25
DON Speaking from experience ah, I know it's lonely ah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
DON there's, there, it's no picnic being in these motels... (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
DON ...night after night and every single week. 

00:23:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. I'm sure you get lonely too on the road. 

00:23:35
DON  Sure. Sure. 

00:23:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
DON That's not pleasant. 

00:23:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Do you talk to Anna about it. Have you, have you ever told her how, how lonely it get's for you? 

00:23:45
DON Ah, no. We really ah, never have talked about it that much. 

00:23:50
BETTY CARTER Where did you learn that a man's lot in life was to be stoic and ah, to endure. 

00:24:00
DON I learned... (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
DON ...that from my father. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
DON To that, you go out each day and you go to work and even if you're sick you go out to work. Ah, that, that's your lot in life. 

00:24:10
BETTY CARTER And how many years do you, did he do that? 

00:24:10
DON Ah, 40 years. 

00:24:15
BETTY CARTER Whew. 

00:24:15
DON You know, hmm. It's a long time. 

00:24:20
BETTY CARTER It's a long time. How many years of that do you think you can take? 

00:24:20
DON  Not much more. Ah, it's, it's getting to be quite a journey(ph). 

00:24:25
BETTY CARTER  Then I guess this isn't really the kind of life you'd like for your son. 

00:24:30
DON  No. No, I, I wanna, I wanna spend more time with him and, and with my daughter. 

00:24:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. And this isn't the kind of life that you'd love him to take of. What you've done and what you're father did. 

00:24:45
DON No, no it's, it's terrible to be away that much. 

00:24:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. So, this, somehow this version of how to be a man isn't really working for you that well anymore. 

00:24:55
DON No, not, no it's, it's not, it's not something that I'm, I'm happy about it. No. 

00:25:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DON  No. (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
BETTY CARTER Ha, have you ever talked to your father? About this, (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
DON About. (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
BETTY CARTER  I mean really openly about it. I mean, how it was for him and what his regrets were and, and the fact that your finding it lonely and stressful. Ha, have you ever talked like that with your Dad? 

00:25:20
DON Ah, no. We, we never really had a talk like that. 

00:25:25
BETTY CARTER What would it be like to have that kind of talk? I mean, could you imagine yourself doing it? Could you talk to your Dad like that or do? 

00:25:35
DON We'll we, I never have ah, (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
BETTY CARTER (inaudible ). 

00:25:39
DON I, I suspect it would be ah, somewhat of a strained talk ah, (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
DON  difficult to(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
BETTY CARTER On whose part? 

00:25:45
DON Uhm, probably on both our parts... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:25:45
DON 'coz I'm very much like him. 

00:25:45
BETTY CARTER  I see. And you two guys don't talk too much on that level. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
DON No. Well ah, I really love my Dad... (crosstalk). 

00:25:55
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
DON ...but we don't really talk about anything. (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Well, would you be up for trying to make a change in that? 

00:26:00
DON  Ah, sure. I, I, I sure. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
BETTY CARTER You know, I'm thinking of you and your son. Is that the way you wanted to be between the two of you... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
DON No. 

00:26:10
BETTY CARTER ...when he grows up... (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
DON No. 

00:26:10
BETTY CARTER  or you want it to be different? 

00:26:15
DON I want it to be, to be different. 

00:26:15
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. Well, I think this would be a way to start that. If you could be different with your father, if you could talk with him differently... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
DON Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
BETTY CARTER ...and loosen that up a bit, I think it'd be much easier for you with your son. Would you be willing to do that? 

00:26:30
DON  Sure. 

00:26:35
BETTY CARTER The other thing I wanted to ask you Don, uhm, what would happen if you just even mentioned to your boss that you'd kind of prefer not to travel so much? 

00:26:50
six months later 

00:26:50
BETTY CARTER Don has discussed work with both his father and mother. And he asked them about their own experiences. His father first denied but then acknowledged his own regrets about his work life and the amount of time that he spent away from home. He mentioned how important it was to him when he came home on weekends to plunge in and make his presence felt. Don discussed his job situation with his boss and found out that if he was willing to shift into technical support services which would require more training, he could travel much less. He's now doing the training and hasn't been on the road for four weeks. 

00:27:35
BETTY CARTER  So, it's like you two have almost been seeing too much of each other lately huh? 

00:27:40
DON Yeah, it ah, it was pretty odd at first, we weren't used... (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
DON ...to seeing ah, so much of each other but ah, it's, it's very good now. We're used to each other. (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:27:50
ANNA Hmm. 

00:27:50
BETTY CARTER Well, then listen. Ah, when things are going well it's always a good time to get some serious work done. What's ah, what's on the agenda for today? 

00:28:00
ANNA Well, something I had wanted to bring up was, now that Donald is home more ah, how we're gonna talk about dividing up household responsibilities a little better. Ah, things with the kids, things around the house. 

00:28:10
DON I can't believe this. Are we ever done? (chuckles) 

00:28:15
BETTY CARTER  Please remember that our vignettes do not show the complete therapy of these couples. These vignettes are brief excerpts that demonstrate how I move into the power issues of gender roles and finances. These power issues can be productively added to the work you now do with couples regardless of your clinical method or style. 

00:28:45
BETTY CARTER Claudia and Bob, our second couple are stressed by an overload of developmental tasks. Although married only three months, they are also faced with all of the complexities of the next stage since Claudia is already pregnant. Being close to 40, they did not want to wait to start a family. Although happy to be pregnant, Claudia started getting headaches and bouts of insomnia, and her gynecologist suggested that she see a therapist. Bob, a computer programmer and consultant, makes about $40,000 a year and Claudia, an executive in her father's marine engine company, made 60,000 until recently when her father raised her salary to $75,000. She had not told Bob about this until I asked each of them about their income during the first session. Needless to say, he was shocked. 

00:29:50
BOB I, I thought you, when did you get the raise? 

00:29:50
CLAUDIA Well uhm, just recently, just the other day. My Dad gave everyone a raise and, I'm sorry I didn't. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BETTY CARTER You mean you didn't know this Bob? 

00:30:00
BOB No, I didn't I. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BETTY CARTER Aren't you glad you came today? (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
BOB Yeah, I(ph), absolutely. 

00:30:00
BETTY CARTER (laughs) Never know what you're gonna find out here. How, how about this Claudia? How come you didn't tell Bob? (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
CLAUDIA Well(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
BETTY CARTER Seems like a raise of that size would be the evening... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
BETTY CARTER ...news. 

00:30:10
CLAUDIA  Well, I didn't think it was ah, a big deal. Uhm, I thought I had just mentioned it to you. Uhm, just happened the other day. My father gave... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
BOB Hmn. 

00:30:20
CLAUDIA ...everyone a raise and so that was. 

00:30:25
BETTY CARTER So, you've been earning quite a bit more than Bob and now, you earn a really lot more. What ah, what effect has this disparity in income had on your decision making process? 

00:30:40
CLAUDIA I, I don't think it's really had a very much of a, of a uhm, impact on it. 

00:30:50
BETTY CARTER Really? 

00:30:50
CLAUDIA No. 

00:30:50
BETTY CARTER How about you Bob, what do you think? 

00:30:50
BOB Well, I think we've been able to sit down and, and pretty much talk over how we're going to, you know, spend our money and so forth and that I, I haven't felt any way that there's been any disparity ah, (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
BOB in that process... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
BOB ...so. 

00:31:05
BETTY CARTER So, you haven't felt less empowered or anything as a result of this? 

00:31:10
BOB Not particularly. 

00:31:10
BETTY CARTER  Would you tell me how you divide up uhm, the chores at home and how you both juggle that with your work. 

00:31:20
CLAUDIA Well, it's not easy. I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
CLAUDIA ...uhm, what, but what we do is we, it's pretty much equally divided. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:31:25
CLAUDIA Bob's at home, so he does a lot of the uhm. 

00:31:30
BOB Yeah. I mean, I throw a load of laundry and in, you know, during the middle(ph) of the day I'll straighten up the house ah, you know, take the garbage out things like that, you know. Little things that take five, ten minutes to do. It's not a problem for me during the course of the day. 

00:31:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:31:45
BOB Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
CLAUDIA Then on my home from work I'll pick up something from the grocery store uhm, that we need. On weekends generally the cleaning that kinda thing we do together. Uhm. 

00:31:55
BOB You know, we share the cooking, you know, if she's gonna be really late on a night I'll, I'll, I'll cook dinner, you know. She's home normal time, you know, I'll leave it for her to do. 

00:32:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
BOB Well, it's a bit pretty, pretty evenly actually. 

00:32:10
BETTY CARTER It sounds that way. What's gonna happen now I mean, when the baby comes? 

00:32:15
CLAUDIA Good question. 

00:32:15
BETTY CARTER Have you discussed that or thought about how that little detail is gonna slip into the schedule there. 

00:32:25
BOB I see. 

00:32:25
CLAUDIA Well, I've been uhm, I've kind of been thinking about it and kind of ah, concerned about it and what that's going to, how it's going to impact on, on how we deal with our lives now. My, my work is really important to me and uhm, there's a lot of things that go on at work which I get a lot of satisfaction out of. 

00:32:40
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
CLAUDIA And as time goes on with my father getting ready to retire uhm, it's going to become more and more important. 

00:32:50
BOB My work is really important to me too, you know. I get a lot of satisfaction out of, you know, being able to work at home and, and, and do the kind of work that I do. 

00:33:00
BETTY CARTER You see what's happening right now is because of the introduction of the added pressure now. Because now with the baby coming, you said it was hard to juggle before, you know, and now it's going to be magnified many times. And so now, you're gonna start to feel a lot more pressure as you tried to decide ah, whose job comes first. Whose job is more important. How do you work this out. Suddenly uhm, suddenly it could turn out to be a little more of a deal than you've made it Claudia. 

00:33:35
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. So, how do we work it out? 

00:33:35
BETTY CARTER Well, (chuckles) I guess that's one of the things that'll be pretty important for us to talk about here. And I, and I, I wanna add one thing. Claudia, I am, I wonder if you are minimizing a little bit the importance of the fact that you make so much more money than Bob does. It usually is a factor. 

00:33:55
CLAUDIA You know maybe, maybe there's something that, that I need to take a look at and we need to, to look at. 

00:34:00
one week later 

00:34:00
BETTY CARTER  More questioning about their families revealed that Bob and his brothers did a lot of house work growing up but no babysitting. Claudia, a firstborn is very much caught up in her parents expectations. Her mother absolutely expects her to quit work and stay at home while her children are young. Her father, however, hope she'll find a way to continue in the company. He looks to her to take over his business when he retires. 

00:34:35
BETTY CARTER Claudia, if you forget for a minute just everything about what Bob would like, what your mother wants, what she's told you, what your father wants, or you think he wants. Will you forget all of that for a minute and just think about what you want. How, how would you arrange it? What do you want? 

00:34:55
CLAUDIA Uhm, I think that for me, the uhm, the best fo, fo, for myself, the best thing would be is if I could uhm, stay home for a couple of months at the beginning and then uhm, work maybe four days a week and cut out traveling. And that would, that would feel, that would feel good to me, that would feel okay... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
CLAUDIA ...to work that way. 

00:35:20
BOB You know what, I think I'd be a little upset at that. 'Coz that's, that's still leaves me with, with 80 percent of the child care during the course of a week and ah, no I don't mind doing my fair share but I think as it starts to get up to, you know, four days a week or so, that it's a little bit more than my fair share at that point. I really don't, don't intend to become a full-time house husband. 

00:35:40
BETTY CARTER  Well, you know Bob, I, I, I understand why you're feeling upset. You know, this is ah, kind of reminiscent of what women have been complaining about for years. Ah, isn't that? You know, (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
BOB Yeah, very much so. 

00:35:55
BETTY CARTER that the, ah, people don't appreciate them... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
BOB Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
BETTY CARTER ...for anything but staying home and then, the staying home part doing your chores and taking care of children is not valued really. It's not ah, appreciated as a, as being important work. 

00:36:10
BOB Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
BETTY CARTER What are your thoughts by becoming a father? 

00:36:15
BOB The part that really scares me is the first couple of years where, you know, they're, they're so helpless and, and you have to do everything for them. 

00:36:20
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. Uh hmm. What was your own father like? 

00:36:25
BOB  Well, you know, he uhm, willing to involve in, in taking care of the kids. I had a, I had a younger sister who's about five years younger than I am and ah, you know, when she was born, I was a small child and so forth. And it was, it was primarily my mother who did all, all of the infant care, you know, ah, the bathing, the changing of the diapers and so forth. 

00:36:50
BETTY CARTER What do you think were the pluses and minuses for your Dad of handling fatherhood in that, sort of, more traditional way? What, what do you think he gained and lost from that way of doing it? 

00:37:00
BOB  Uhm, I think maybe what he gained was uhm, he was probably living the way, you know, he thought men were supposed to do things. I think maybe what he lost was a little bit of the uhm, you know, the bonding, the bonding part. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
BOB 'coz he was always a little distant from, from us kids. It wasn't until we were much older in life that, that things became closer between us, so. 

00:37:30
BETTY CARTER And is that something that you ah, are interested in changing in, as you become a father? Is that the part you wanna change? 

00:37:35
BOB  Yeah, I, I really would. I mean, I, I would like to play a very significant role in the raising of, of our child. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:37:45
BOB you know, I'd, I'd like to, to be there more in the beginning, uhm, than what my father was... (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
BOB ...ah, for, for his children. 

00:37:50
BETTY CARTER Yeah. And so, now we come to the dilemma, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
BOB I know. 

00:37:55
BETTY CARTER how to gain, how to gain that part... (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
BOB Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
BETTY CARTER ...of being closer and more bonded and everything else without, without losing too much of what your father had in the way of pursuing his own career, huh? 

00:38:10
BOB You know what, it's, it's really tough to bounce the two. (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
BETTY CARTER It is. 

00:38:10
BOB  Uhm, I mean, one part of me would really like to spend, you know, a lot of time... (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:38:20
BOB ...being ah, you know, taking care of the child and so forth. Yet another part of me really feels that I need to concentrate on, on my career. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
BOB because society in general will judge me more by my career than, than by, you know, how I raise my child... (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:38:35
BOB ...and, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
BOB It's so. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
BETTY CARTER So, we have a scenario here where if you're at a big cocktail party or something and ah, somebody comes up to you and says, "Well, so what do you do?" 

00:38:50
BOB Well, you know, (chuckles) that I'm not sure how to answer that, you know, if, if I felt that I was able to ah, to balance things properly, then I, I would probably say that, you know, I'm, I'm a computer programmer, independent consultant. But on the other hand, if I felt like we weren't able to share things right, and that I was doing more than what I felt I should be doing, I might respond with something like, "Well, I'm just a house husband." 

00:39:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:39:20
BOB You know, and ah. (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. And feel bad about it. 

00:39:20
BOB And feel bad about it, yeah. 

00:39:25
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
six weeks later 

00:39:25
BETTY CARTER By this time, Bob and Claudia have worked out an arrangement that makes sense to them. Each of them will work three uninterrupted days with a nanny taking charge fully on one day during which both will work. On the other days, the nanny will help out whichever one of them is at home. Claudia decided that she will take some three-day weekends and longer vacations. And Bob will cut his work back especially during slower periods when typically he would be out looking for new projects. 

00:40:00
CLAUDIA  I think that we've really uhm, come up with a pretty, a pretty descent plan for us. We think, ah, I feel very comfortable with it... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
BOB Yeah. 

00:40:10
CLAUDIA ...uhm, and uhm, we're going to be looking to find a nanny and I've asked a few friends how you, you know, how you go, go 'bout it and what kinds of things to look for... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
CLAUDIA ...uhm, 'coz I understand that can be a long process. 

00:40:25
BETTY CARTER You bet. Yeah. I know it's really tough to find... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
BETTY CARTER ...ah, the right nanny, (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
BETTY CARTER ...you know that? So, it's... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
BETTY CARTER ...good you start in(ph) early. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
BETTY CARTER And the plan is great. It, it's sounds like you both got something, each got something... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
BETTY CARTER ...that you really wanted out of it... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
BETTY CARTER  gave up a little and it, it sounds like it would work. Well, the bad news is that, that was the easy part. Now, what I think the tough part is gonna be for you Claudia talking to your folks 'coz your Mom is... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
CLAUDIA Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
BETTY CARTER  gonna be unhappy to hear that you're working at all and your Dad is gonna moan and groan that, you know, you're cutting back to three... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
CLAUDIA Uh-huh. 

00:41:00
BETTY CARTER ...days so. 

00:41:00
CLAUDIA  That, that's really true. I'm especially concerned about how I'm going to ah, speak to my mother about it. 

00:41:10
BETTY CARTER To tell you the truth, I think we ought to plan that pretty carefully. I, I think you and I ought to work together uhm, how you gonna bring that discussion about and how that's, how, how to put that out in the best way. 

00:41:20
CLAUDIA Okay. 

00:41:20
BETTY CARTER  And Bob, you know, uhm, I'm looking at the genogram here. I see that uhm, each of your brother has already has two kids and I, I was wondering, sort of, how they're doing it, you know, uhm, whether you're a pioneer in the family here or whether they're trying some different things to. Ah, I think it might be really helpful for you if you had ah, some talks with your brothers. You got all these fathers in this family, you got three, four and now you're gonna make five, you five fathers here. And I'm just wondering if there's any talk about fathering going on in. 

00:42:00
BOB Well, nobody has talked to me about it. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
BETTY CARTER Okay. Okay. 

00:42:05
BOB But ah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
BETTY CARTER Well, I would use that as a guide then. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
BOB Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
BETTY CARTER I bet nobody's talking to anybody about it. And I. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
BOB Right. You're probably right. Yeah. 

00:42:10
BETTY CARTER  I'm thinking that ah, maybe we could work together on, uhm, planning a little bit of that for you to have some... (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
BOB Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
BETTY CARTER ...thought. There's no sense in each one of you reinventing the will here, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
BOB Yeah. That's true. 

00:42:25
BETTY CARTER In this program, I've shown you how I assess a marriage from the three overlapping lenses of the multi-contextual framework. I've also illustrated some of the ways that I bring socio-cultural issues, particularly those relating to gender and power into my work with marital couples. The past two decades of feminism have made us all aware of the enormous impact of gender in determining power and human relationships. In marriage, this is a most concretely in the husbands and wives gendered-access to money. Who is paid how much for doing what? Who manages the money? Who decides on its disposition? Who has veto power over financial decisions? Gender inequality cuts across all of the other power inequities arising from the socially sanctioned hierarchies of race, culture, and class. Because the impact of gender is so pervasive, we don't easily see it. And then, it even after we're made aware of it, there's still the difficult challenge of how to translate this awareness into our clinical practice. This is still work in progress for all of us.
