LINDA HANSON  My name is Linda Hanson. Just wait till we get this one. And I have, just as an introduction for those who don't know me, I have a PhD I did in Thyroid Education and Thyroid. Thyroid is one of my specialties. I have a special interest in thyroid. I have a Masters Degree in Counselling, Bachelor Degree in Health Science Homeopathy. I am an EFT practitioner and facilitator, I am a kinesiologist. I am a Structural Analyst, Massage Therapist and I work very successfully with the Electromagnetic Field and other incredibly interesting aspects of quantum physics and I do voice analysis and I work with facial structure, function and expression. I'm a bit of everything. So once a researcher, always a researcher and I really do like to know who I'm talking to. So could you please indicate whether you are -- if you are a counsellor, okay. Psychologist? Doctor? Teacher? Educator? Some haven't lifted their hands at all. Those are either hiding or they think they should be at another -- a coach, yes, okay. Now because I have so many fields in which I have an intense interest, I'm not an expert in any of them and I don't profess to be so. Anyone who says they know anything about quantum physics, you know jolly well they don't know anything at all. Anyone who says they know anything about the body, mmm, same principle. So what I have is, is an intense interest in the holistic perspective. Now looking down around you, at all you lovely people here, I cannot imagine what I can tell you that you don't already know because information is information and no matter what angle you come at it, you know it. We might use different words, different terms. So what I'm hopeful to do today is to give you a different perspective of what you already know, to give you a different way of looking at what you already know. In order to do that, I need to give you information and the trick is I don't know which one piece of information is going to make the change in your perspectives, your brain operation. So you're going to get bombarded with a lot of information. If you get just one piece out of that, that you go 'oh', then it will have been a success. So what I hope to do is to encourage you to have a different look or to see things in a different way. So who are purists, who are counsellors or who are one thing? None of you. I thought you were all sneaky. Who have two strings to their bow? Who has a -- who -- you didn't arrive fully formed counsellors, what were you before? What led you into being a counsellor? 

00:03:55
 (inaudible ). 

00:04:00
LINDA HANSON Very good. I also have a hearing problem. So if I say 'what?', so what else brought you people to counselling? 

00:04:15
 (inaudible ). 

00:04:20
LINDA HANSON Alright. Thank you. Very good. Anyone else? You all have a history. I can tell that you all have a history. 

00:04:40
 (inaudible ). 

00:04:45
LINDA HANSON Wonderful. Congratulations. Is it working? 

00:04:50
 (inaudible ). 

00:04:52
LINDA HANSON So being made redundant had its advantages. Okay. 

00:04:55
 (inaudible ). 

00:05:00
LINDA HANSON Exactly. So, anyone else who like to share any -- yes? 

00:05:05
 (inaudible ). 

00:05:10
LINDA HANSON Alright. Thank you. Any engineers? Any hairdresser -- engineers? 

00:05:20
 Initially an engineer (inaudible ). 

00:05:25
LINDA HANSON I used to be the manager of Bearing Service. I used to crawl down mine shafts and around over cultural machinery and dirty, greasy bearings. So we all have a different history. And that history no matter what direction it started, it has brought you to where you are today and regardless of how diverse your careers are or your interests are, when you are doing what you are doing, you are using everything that you have learned, everything. Even though it might be something completely different. Your skills, your talents, your innate capabilities are all there. So that's what I would like to play with this morning. And it's playing, trust me, I know it's Sunday morning. So what I would like you to do as we go along is just to make notes of what sort of a counsellor you are. Now I'm not naive enough to think that there is just one way of counselling. So what I would like you to do is to make a note of how you see yourself as a counsellor and I would encourage you to write this down, don't keep it in your head because a big process of this conference has been neurology, has been the -- your neural nets. Now when you are thinking about something, you are using one set of neurons but when you actually write and do and the action, what's being called in this conference as homework is called praxis in other fields, you actually activate a different set of neurons. And if you are familiar with the 'fire together, wire together' principle, you'll find that if you actually do an action with your thought, in future times, in later times when you have that thought, the neural networks that fire for the action fire too. So it is much easier to follow through with the action after the thought. So in writing down, you are actually triggering that principle. So take your time, write it down and use whatever words that you are familiar with, qualitative, quantitative, you can use a client-centered, practitioner-centered, doesn't have to be the technical terms, if you know them, use them because that's your paradigm. If you don't know them, just write down what you do.

LINDA HANSON Okay. Now in my PhD, I was a challenge to the university to which I went and there are parts of neurology, psychology, embryology, I'm not an expert in embryology but I love it, I really love it, all these aspects because I'm very interested in mind, body. The big theme of this conference has been the sensory motor but they haven't taken the sensory motor into mind, body as two ends of the one continuum. So I am very interested in the endocrine system, the immune system, anatomy, physiology. I am a homeopath and so I see people who come to me who have physical problems, they are ill. So I get to see both sides, I get to see mind, body and I get to see how they either work together or work against each other. So my -- I am also -- I had a very brief but trust me, brilliant career of six weeks in acupuncture after which I decided that, that wasn't for me and I decided I would follow through homeopathy which is how I brought my children up. They are homeopathic kids, experiments, no -- yes. They did survive so I did learn a bit. I am a kinesiologist. Does anyone had a brush with kinesiology? Aha, thank you. And spirituality or mindfulness, those, if you are interested in the meditation, meditation has garnered quite a few different names in order for it to be accepted in different fields. If you remember and I see enough beautiful colored hair out there to -- for everyone to realize that many years ago, meditation was a dirty word. It just was not accepted. But over time it has been accepted and it is now basically called mindfulness or if you are really brave, spirituality. So I enjoy using those principles. For one thing the embryology reinforces the information though I get from kinesiology about face structure. There is a lot around about interpreting face structure which the skeptics go 'doo doo doo doo' but if you like to look at embryology, you can see the basis on which that face structure is built. So what all my interests and all my research has given me is the confidence that when I say whatever I say, if I am challenged, I can generally take you back to the science of it. So what the research did for me was to give me confidence in what I knew to be pretty accurate. So because of my many interests, what I am going to do today is to limit my presentation to two approaches. One is going to be counselling, we are going to look at the types, the styles, the prerequisites, desired traits, benefits and just a couple of the pitfalls.

00:12:05
LINDA HANSON And then, because I happen to like the media, we are going to look at the media, types and styles, what those types and styles are for, what they deliver, the benefits and of course the pitfalls. So let's start with counselling. What do you think of when you think of counsellor? What comes to mind when someone says counsellor? Who counsels? Stepping outside your own paradigm, who else counsels? Everybody. Very good. And it's Sunday morning, we're doing well, aren't we? But okay.

00:13:00
LINDA HANSON So yes, everybody counsels. That is just the type of counselling. So when you say I am a counsellor, the distinction is what type of counsellor you are. Grandma counsels, grandad counsels, your mother and father counsel, you might not like the counsel but they do counsel. The bartender, the hairdresser, the exercise -- your personal trainer counsels, everyone counsels but it's the what you do and how you do it that makes the difference in your life and it must make a difference in your life before it can make a difference in someone else's life. So why do you think counseling has become a profession? What happened to grandma? What happened to nana? What happened to grandad? What happened to the wise elders who held the gems of knowledge, who held the wisdom? Where did they go? We're going to see if we can find where they went because I'm interested in why counseling is no longer the province of home and family. Why is it that you have to go to a professional counselor for counseling? When did counseling become a profession and not just a way of life? So what do you think of when you think of counseling? 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
 Helping. 

00:14:40
LINDA HANSON Helping. Now do you think of a lawyer's counseling? Mind you, it's very expensive counsel but what do they -- you go for legal counsel. So there are many, many, many people who counsel. So it's interesting to see how we have come to be counsellors and if you follow that through, there is an understanding of why counsellors don't really get the recognition they get because everybody counsels. A psychologist is taught and trained. A psychologist is taught and trained but counseling? The guy down behind the pub can do that. They can get just as much counseling from the hairdressers. So what puts us into the professional range? 

00:15:35

00:15:35
Counsellor Counselling 

00:15:35
LINDA HANSON So the history of counselling used to be individual, specific, private. It used to be one-on-one if you like to go right back as far as it's possible to go. Counselling was an old man showing a young man how to hunt, how to track, how to gather, the wisdom, collect that one, don't collect that one. It's counseling, it's teaching and there is only a very very fine line between counseling and teaching. So are you teachers? Yes. So counseling that was personal, specific, private, you went to your grandmother or you went to your grandfather or someone that you trusted, that has gone because the trust in those people has gone. So it has gone to global, it's mass, it's public, it's prolific and in some cases, rather questionable quality. In the old days it was the -- you were an apprentice, you had a mentor, the teacher, the student and learning the ways of survival and that was where the first counsel came in where the elders had respect and they held the knowledge that was handed on. Now if we go backwards, I love this, this is 1693. 

00:17:15

00:17:15
Individual, personal, private and specific 

00:17:15
moved to 

00:17:15
Global, mass, public, prolific and in some cases rather 

00:17:15
questionable quality 

00:17:15
LINDA HANSON This is where counselling moved from a personal, individual one-on-one process into something more public. Now the outcomes of this saw that the children of The Athenian Mercury, The Woman's Day, Woman's Weekly, Dolly, Dear Abby, all the agony aunts and uncles of the 20th century. Now it's really interesting because they named this magazine, it was named out of the Bible because in Acts 17:21, it reads "all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas". Not much has changed. So that's why they called it the Athenian Mercury. Now the questions that were invited to this paper were the most nice and curious, interesting words, nice and curious questions, ran from natural sciences to religion, to literature and politics. During the lifetime of the magazine, the experts grappled with thousands of questions and to their credit, this magazine was most forward and it actually accepted questions from women because in those days women were not considered 'able to think'. Men did the thinking. The readers submitted questions like 'Were there any men before Adam?' 'Is there an impartial and true history of the world?' 'How can a man know when he dreams or when he is really awake?' So this was the sort of thing that they wanted to discuss which brings us to this day and age, we'll go back a bit. So we have really long-term written advice in the sacred texts. If we go back to the sacred texts, everything is in the sacred text. There is not much that's new under the sun if you wish to mine or dig into the sacred text, it's all there. So then we have long-term. We have novels, diaries, biographies. Have you ever got your hands on some really old diaries and really old biographies? They are just priceless. And media and visual film, I was going to put into short term but if you see some of the really old films, you'll actually see that they are passing into long term. Women's magazines, newspaper columns. Now the shorter term that we have is the Internet, mobile phones, SMS, text. If you can forget how to write, you can text, which brings us to Facebook, Twitter, Google.

LINDA HANSON With -- I like to call this 'infolanches'. This is just absolute avalanches of information. So with all this advice available, how do we decide what is worthwhile advice and what is not?

00:21:05
LINDA HANSON How do we tell the difference between wise counsel and fools? Does anyone like Charlie Brown? Okay. Is he wise counsel or is he a fool? Exactly. Very, very wise. So when you look at that, does cost indicate quality? If you had to pay the psychiatrist $0.05, would you trust him? Do people value counsel that they have to pay dearly for? Is it more expensive, the better it gets? Do they value counsel that has no cost? Is it cheap and can be ignored? Does it take a price to put a value on it? What gives counsel its value? Is it availability? Is it the match that you have with the person that you are talking to? Is it common sense? Is counsel just common sense? Is it solutions, is it questions? Is it acceptance, is it judgement? Now if patients chose at times to consult the television, what sort of practitioner would they choose? Anyone like science fiction? Anyone an Issac Asimov fan? Okay. 

00:22:35
What is the difference between 

00:22:35
wise counsel counsel of fools 

00:22:35
LINDA HANSON I'll read this out and you will probably read it ahead of me but once we have computer outlets in every home, each of them hooked up to enormous libraries, this is written in 1988, where anyone can ask any question and be given answers, be given reference materials, something you are interested in knowing from an early age, how silly it might seem to someone else that's what you're interested in and you can ask and you can find out and you can do it in your own home at your own speed in your own direction, in your own time. Then everyone would enjoy learning. Nowadays what people call learning is forced on you and everyone is forced to learn the same thing at the same time at the same speed in class and everyone is different. Now can that principle be applied to counseling? Can you get the kind of advice that you need when you need it from the people that you know? Now some television characters or now Internet characters are more familiar and actually more well known than family members and they are more trusted than family members. Fathers are often absent, unknown or, theoretically at least, non-existent. Grandparents are distanced, siblings are often half brothers or sisters with some members of even large families not even having full blood siblings. In this day and age, do people turn to the television and films for a familiar face, a predictable presence that will be there -- God bless you -- when help is needed. Anyone watched Groundhog Day over and over again to get the message? How rich and full of advice is Groundhog Day? It is priceless. So if counselling was a TV show, who or what would you like to be? So let's take some broad categories and just have a look. 

00:24:35
Issac Azimov - 1988 

00:24:35
Once we have computer outlets in every home, each of 

00:24:35
them hooked up to enormous libraries, where anyone can 

00:24:35
ask any question and be given answers, be given reference 

00:24:35
materials, be something you are interested in knowing, from 

00:24:35
an early age, how silly it might seem to someone else 

00:24:35
that's what YOU are interested in, and you can ask and you 

00:24:35
can find out and you can do it in your own home at your 

00:24:35
own speed in your own direction, in your own time. Then 

00:24:35
everyone would enjoy learning. Nowadays what people call 

00:24:35
learning is forced on you and everyone is forced to learn 

00:24:35
the same thing, on the same day at the same speed in class, 

00:24:35
and everyone is different. - Issac Azimov 

00:24:35
LINDA HANSON Are you the news of the day? Do you look for headlines? Do you want sensationalism? Do you just skim the top? Are you the weather report, changing every day? Are you a sports report? Well, we leave you to decide what you would be if you were a sports report? Are you a current affair? Now a current affair is a little bit deeper than the news, a little bit more information than just the headlines so -- and controversial. It stirs. So what about the plethora of reality shows? Has anyone stopped to think why the reality shows are so popular at the moment? Is it because that people no longer get access to that reality in their new life? Is it vicarious experience? Is it a safe way to experience something else while someone else is doing it? You don't face the loss, you certainly don't face the embarrassment, you don't face the grief and you can make mistakes and not pay a price whereas the old-fashioned way is you learn from your mistakes and you learned a whole lot more. You learned it in a different way, in a mind-body way whereas this way from the reality shows, it's simply, it's standing off, it's being a spectator in someone else's life. Find My Family. Are you one of those who like to dig in and find out all the family, the family strengths? Anyone like to watch Find My Family and see the healing that happens when the family is found? Who do you think you are? Does anyone like that one? That one is excellent to watch. So Detective, Law & Order. Anyone see themselves as a detective? 'Coz detective is very close to counseling. You observe -- you have a problem, you observe, you look for clues and you find solutions. So detective shows are very, very appealing. Medical. Anyone like to -- anyone involved in the medical side of their clients? No? So are you a documentary? Are you a history channel? Do you like to go through the history and find out everything that happened in the past? Archeology? Do you like to dig? Do you like to get in there and dig and find out what's wrong? Do you like to go deep-sea fishing and find all the characters, all the different life forms under there? Or do you like the moon and the planets? Are you a bit off the planet, a bit out there? Or are you intergalactic and way beyond anything that is concrete? Do you prefer how-to shows? This is how you do it. The Renovators. Anyone watch The Renovators? So are you a renovator? Do you get rid of the old parts, do you remake the new parts, do you design new parts? So are you a how-to? Masterchef. Do you like to follow the recipe to make it exactly like someone else does? Or do you like the mystery box where you open the box and you have to make something out of what's there? So there are lots and lots and lots of ways that you can be a counsellor. Now in the counselling area and counselling types, we have the all different areas of the counselling type. Now we can have -- these are just a few and I acknowledge there are a whole lot more.

LINDA HANSON We have eating disorders, we have family counselling, we have relationship counselling, sexual. We have guidance and career, student counselling, legal counsel, substance addiction, grief, trauma and, and, and, the type of counseling goes on. So what I like to show you that all the counseling styles and what you do are based on -- this is a pictorial view of the slide before for those who like pictures.

Trauma 

00:29:35
And... 

00:29:35
And... 

00:29:35
LINDA HANSON So we have grief counseling, we have relationship, we have abuse, marriage etc etc and we have one up there, guidance and career but all your counselling must be based on the essence of the person. Without understanding the essence, pardon me, without understanding the essence of the person, your counselling is just technical. It's a technique. So how do you identify the inner essence? 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:20
LINDA HANSON Not a rhetorical question. 

00:30:20
 Exploring. 

00:30:25
LINDA HANSON Pardon? 

00:30:25
 Explore. 

00:30:25
LINDA HANSON Explore. How do you explore? 

00:30:25
 Questioning. 

00:30:25
LINDA HANSON  Questioning. Any other way? 

00:30:30
 (inaudible )listening. 

00:30:35
LINDA HANSON Listening. Okay. In this, does anyone consider the patient's health? You do? Because the patient's health can color all of these other features. So does anyone -- is anyone aware of when your patients have headaches, when they have backache, when they hurt, when their feet hurt, all these sorts of things because that is all part and parcel of the person and you cannot counsel someone who has a headache. You cannot counsel the woman who is sitting there and you know she is glazed over, she stopped listening or stopped being able to listen about 10 minutes ago. Can you counsel the restless patient when they are sitting still? You need to consider their health. Now take a moment and think about your patients and write down about 3 or 4 of them, about their health status, what you know about their health status. And how do you consider those problems affect the way you deal with them? Do you get up and go for a walk with the restless ones? Do you offer the ones with a headache a cold cloth for their head? Do you address their health problems at the time in the interview? Do you recommend that they go and see someone? Do you recommend that they seek help for something that you can see that's not quite right? If it is not identified, do you encourage them to go and look for it? So how do you identify the essence through appearance because that's the main identifier? So it's observation, awareness, perception. Now the essence is seen in appearance. Dress. Who considers the dress of the patient? Sorry, I call them patients because that's what I call them. So you, patient, client, you can interchange your own words. But for me because of my homeopathic approach, to me they are patients. So when you look at their clothing, do you consider that their clothing is careful, do you think it is careless, do you think it is ostentatious, do you think it is underdone? What is your perception of their dress because a dress is often or their style of clothing is a reflection of themselves. Now that can be used either as an extension of themselves or it can be used as camouflage to hide who they really are. So being able to discern what that dress means to them is quite important because what it means to you may be something quite different. Posture. Who goes by posture? Who reads the body language? Okay. My studies in anatomy and kinesiology and -- have given me insights into posture which are really quite helpful. Presentation. How do they present, happy, cheerful? Do they present depressed? One of my favorite Charlie Brown cartoons is, you probably have seen it at some stage, Charlie says, Lucy -- as Charlie Brown comes in and I think it is Lucy who says to him, "You are not depressed, you can't be depressed, you cannot be depressed like this, this is how you have got to be when you are depressed." You stand like that and try to smile. The minute you open up, it is a whole new ballgame. So Charlie Brown and Charlie -- Lucy was worth her $0.05. Face. The face of course gives so much away. Is anyone familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome? Very good. Well, then you will know that the features, the facial features of a child with fetal alcohol syndrome gives the indication that there is brain damage. Now McLaren says that if they have the features, there is brain damage. There is just no doubt about it. It is simply the degree. So our features indicate our brain function. And your face pops out of your brain function. So face is incredibly important and incredibly revealing. The voice. Who takes notice of the voice? Loud, soft, hurried, slow. Who enjoyed The Magician last night? Nobody? Nobody enjoyed The Magician? Oh, one enjoyed The Magician. Yes. Well, I spoke to him this morning and you know when he was trying to work out whether who was lying, he was listening for the change in the voices. Now your voice is not monotone, your voice consists of notes that give you that sound. And I do voice analysis which analyses the voice and gives me back the notes. And it's a very very interesting experience to see the difference in the notes and what those notes mean. And after a treatment or after a session, we will redo the voice and see the change in the voice and correlate that to how the person feels. So your voice is a dead giveaway and it's very distinctive. How many times do you ring someone up and they go and as soon as you say hello, they know who it is. It's because your voice is as distinctive as your fingerprints and you have that tone that people can hear. Gesture. Gesture is a dead giveaway. Just as a matter of useless information, did you know that when you are forming, the speech areas form in both the left and the right brain. Over time the speech area shifts to the left brain. Anyone ever wonder what that part in the right brain is now doing? It is given over to gesture. So when you put those two things together, you can understand why some people must talk with their hands. So it's not a case if you cut some people's hands off, they can't talk. So when you have someone who is gesturing, just remember that, that their right brain is as active in their interaction with you as their left brain, perhaps even more. Facial expressions. Now the facial expressions that we all know, anger, fear, whatever, there is so much literature around about this at the moment that the micro expressions that we pick up but are not aware of have now been proven by computer examination of micro expressions. So your instinct about someone is now being validated by technology. The eyes. Enough said about the eyes. I mean there is really nothing to say about the eyes. Everybody reads the eyes, the windows of the soul. So you must be aware of people when they look at you, look away from you, they -- you must respond to that. Even if you are not aware of it, subconsciously you respond. So that all adds up to the whole overall look. So where does all this happen? Where do you see, where do you get to see your patient/client? It's the interview. Right? 

00:40:05
How do you identify the 

00:40:05
essence through 

00:40:05
appearances? 

00:40:05
LINDA HANSON Now where does your interview generally take place? In your own rooms? Okay. We have formal, informal, official, unofficial. We have office, home, park, park bench, bus stop. Some of your best counseling sessions will happen in the checkout line at Woolworth. When you are standing there and the person in front of you turns around or the person behind you goes "ah, my brother -- my father died and I got left out of the will and " blah blah blah and way they go. And then they walk off quite happy. Why? Because they have dumped it all on you. Now that is an excellent counseling situation. The patient, customer -- customer doesn't realize what they are doing because after they walk away, they don't leave it with you. They take it with them to dump it on the next person. If they realize that they just got a free counseling session, it would be excellent. Counseling. Free counseling in the cold's(ph) pickup line. I must have it written on my forehead because I get that quite a bit.

LINDA HANSON So let's have a look at the components of an interview. We have actors, we're getting now into what the technical people like to call, we have practitioner and a patient. We have an ambience, we have the space in between, we have verbal exchanges and any one dispute that we have energetic exchanges at the same time. So the type of interview that we have is we're going to look at the types of interviews, the style, the purpose and the outcomes. So what type of interview do you conduct? Has your style changed? Does it need to change? Now we are going to go to some quantum principles and keep in mind, I don't really understand quantum physics. I just like the bits that I do understand. So we're going to look at quantum principles applied to the interview. 

00:42:25
The interview 

00:42:25
Where do your interviews usually take place? 

00:42:25
LINDA HANSON So we have the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which means that measurement is difficult. It's either a wave or a particle or both and the observer changes the wave and the particle. Is everyone familiar with those principles? So when you are looking at it, it's a particle and when you are not looking at it, it's a wave. The Hawthorne effect. Everyone knows that one. It's the motivational effective interest being shown in them. It's a short-lived improvement and it's specific to the circumstances. So you can have an interview with your client and they go "wow, I feel really great!". They walk outside and they start to repeat the same behavior because the Hawthorne effect is only temporary. So the active measuring something changes it. This is 100 years old, this principle. But the -- when you start to measure something, you actually change it. And for this reason, surveys, questionnaires, interviews are notoriously unreliable as the patient changes underneath your scrutiny. What they do as opposed to what they say they do. That's why I have very little confidence in questionnaires. Try to understand what is happening, what they are doing rather than what they are saying what is happening and what they are doing. So what you need to do is you need to find that gap between what they are saying they do and what they are actually doing. So let's look at the quantum physics perspective. We have just talked about that so the infinite possibilities are collapsed by the observer. The observer decides the desired reality of the observed.

LINDA HANSON Now what does that mean in a counselling interview? It means that before the patient comes in the possibilities for that patient are infinite. When the patient comes in, the practitioner determines the reality of the patient at that time in keeping with the practitioner's personal paradigm. In other words, the practitioner determines the reality of the patient. So here is where the kind of patient that you are is of vital importance. Applying these principles to any interview means that the practitioner actually chooses the reality of the patient according to your own paradigm. But what do you see? Do you see all that the patient can be or is or do you see only what you can see? To do this we’re going to have a look at three aspects. We’re going to look at the observer.

LINDA HANSON The practioner and effects of the practioner of the patient and course of the interview. We’re going to look at the methodologies. We’re going to look at perspectives. And we’re going to look at the tools that you use. We’re going to have a very close look at perception and perspective because these define what sort of practitioner you are. You will treat only what you can see. You will deal only with what you can see. So what we’re going to do is, we're going to give this to pictures cos it’s Sunday morning. 

00:46:10
Quantum physics perspectives 

00:46:10
Wave/particle duality 

00:46:10
When we look, it's a particle, when we don't 

00:46:10
look, it's a wave 

00:46:10
Infinite possibilities are 

00:46:10
collapsed by the observer 

00:46:10
Observer decides the desired reality 

00:46:10
Before the patient comes in, 

00:46:10
the possibilities are infinite. 

00:46:10
When the patient comes in, 

00:46:10
the practitioner determines the 

00:46:10
reality of the patient at that 

00:46:10
time, it keeping with the 

00:46:10
practitioner's personal 

00:46:10
paradigm. 

00:46:10
Practitioner 

00:46:10
determines the reality 

00:46:10
of the patient. 

00:46:10
LINDA HANSON So what we have is -- this is the practitioner. Now hopefully the practitioner has self-confidence, warmth, caring, acceptance, competence, understanding skills, expertise and they are reassuring. Now the patient comes with self-awareness and they do come with self-awareness, it’s the degree of self-awareness. You cannot say they are not self-aware, but of course they are. They have – they come with symptoms, they come with causes, exciting and maintaining causes, they come with lifestyle disorders, they come with diet, creativity, new choices. So then we have the interview in between them. We have what is called information and energy exchange through that process, through the interview. So what we have is, the energy – the patient gives you information, you sort it out and then you give information back, which allows them to make different choices, which allows them to give you more information and the practioner makes different choices and then the energy information exchange keeps going round and round and round. Now what happens then is, according to quantum physics we can only see what we can see. So within the paradigm – oh! I found it. Within the paradigm, this is the – this represents the practitioner’s paradigm. So it only stands to reason that you can only see in the patient what is in your paradigm. So we have to consider that when we’re dealing with patients and clients that we have to allow physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and all the other parts that we don’t know about. And their must be much about which we know nothing, so we see the world through our own lens and Mendel, if you’re familiar with Mendel, calls that a non-consensus reality. It is real of us. There is a consensus reality, which we all agree that this is a table, but the non-consensus reality is what the meaning that we give to the table. 

00:48:45
Observer 

00:48:45
Methodologies 

00:48:45
Methods 

00:48:45
LINDA HANSON So we’re trying to get all that together. So what we have now is what if your lens is a bit cross-eyed? What do you think your lens is? I like you to take a moment, don’t copy that down, don’t copy that down, I like you to take some time and just have a think about what your lens is when you view a patient. How do you restrict your patient to what you know? How many people believe their own health affects their interview? Not much, very good. What sort of steps do you take to either limit that or to adjust to it? Who sleeps well? Who’s overweight? Who has sleep apnea? Who snores? I have to ask a friend for that. Whose diet is optimal? Who gets good quality protein, essential fatty acids, good quality carbohydrates? Have you ever had a head injury, played football, been in an accident? All of these things shape your lens. Your own health could be, your own experiences are the lens through which you view other people. Now this is the energy into which – in which your interview takes place. Now depending on – depending on your upbringing, your beliefs, your own paradigm, this can be called in, um, teaching or teachers use the Winnicott term holding environment, this is a holding environment where learning can take place. If you are in research, it’s called being on the same wavelength. If you have ever researched Minichiello, he calls it being on same wavelength where researcher and interviewer attempt to become on the same wavelength in order to understand the person’s feelings. If you’re into energy, it’s the electromagnetic field, McFadden. If you are into – it’s biomorphic energy and if you don’t believe in anything, it’s not there at all. So whatever you believe in, it has different names, it has – it’s a resonant field, it’s whatever you wish to call it. So here we are, we have patient and practioner and when you put them together, the energies mix, the energies meld. So the space of a caregiver – a metaphor for the space of a caregiver is to support a child beginning to develop her own sense of self. Um, Casalino describes a similar scenario as loving atmosphere with worthwhile role models. Because of the latest understanding of how neurological function can actually be changed by external influences, researches in the nature-nurture genre now define the power of such a relationship as capable of overcoming set in stone genetic inheritances. You heard – you heard other speakers speak of the DNA and how the DNA is no longer – I was going to say God, but any way, is no longer the driver. And when you see – you saw Richard’s presentation, when you saw the DNA unfold and at that level, DNA is simply energy. So your energy can change the DNA and it is being proven, Ho has – her research has shown that a mother’s love can change a child’s DNA. You can with that -- that loving presence actually change a lot of the genetic possible disadvantages that may occur later. The power of the energy, your power as a practitioner, you probably already know how powerful you are, but when you can appreciate this you can understand that is of the utmost importance to get yourself right before you start to deal with someone else because just as easily as you can change this for good, you can also do harm also, you can change it. So how do you perceive your client? Do you perceive them biologically? Do you perceive them consciously? Do you see them through your training? Do you see them logically, technically, subconsciously or intuitively? Not a rhetorical question. Now that can be divided down into, intuitive or scientifically, intuitive or training. How do you perceive your clients? And when I say clients, I’m not saying that as a professional counselor because remember we all counsel. So how do you perceive the person that you are talking to? Are you using techniques? Not techniques. Have you learned techniques? Just as a matter of interest, what -- what is the general consensus of the definition of intuition. Sorry. 

00:55:20
 Assumption, assumption. 

00:55:25
LINDA HANSON Assumption, anything else? Sorry. 

00:55:30
 It’s a gut feeling. 

00:55:30
LINDA HANSON Oh! Gut feeling. Yes, yes what else? 

00:55:35
 Knowing. 

00:55:35
LINDA HANSON Knowing. 

00:55:35
 A sense of seeing something beyond (inaudible ). Something beneath that. 

00:55:45
LINDA HANSON Okay, do we have agreement with that? 

00:55:45
 (inaudible ). 

00:55:50
LINDA HANSON Ah! Tapping into wisdom. If I could give you just a particular perception of intuition, intuition comes from within. It is a combination of all your experience, all that you’ve learned, everything that you know. Knowing something, which is psychic, is something that comes from completely external to you. Now intuition – I tell you a story, it’s the easiest way, I’m a grand story teller. Does anyone know the story of how the sewing machine was invented? Well, the gentlemen who invented the sewing machine managed the whole machine but he ran into trouble with the needle. He did not know how to get the needle into the sewing machine, because when you think of it the needle has a thread on one end and the point on the other, he didn’t know which end to attach. This caused him a great deal of difficulty. One night he had a dream about these natives, they were attacking him and they had these funny spheres, they had spheres that had holes in the end of them. He woke up so excited because he knew how to fix the sewing machine. He put the hole and the point at the same end, which was the native’s spheres. Now, that was intuition because intuition takes what you know and puts it together in a different way to give you a new thought. This is – intuition is not generally an external thing. So the more you learn, the more you know, the more you become aware of the more you observe, the more you take in, guess what? The more intuitive you are. And that gut feeling is your brain working on all those pieces of information that got stashed in there and you weren’t aware of, sorts it all out and it’s not fast enough to bring it back to your conscious mind, so where does it hit? Hits your gut. Then over a period of time as it filters back up – back up into the frontal cortex, it could be five minutes, ten minutes, you know, for some of us it’s a week later and you go hmm. If you get it straight away it’s an aha moment, which is really lovely and you look really great. If it’s a week later, it’s duh moment and doesn’t have the impact, doesn’t have the heeling effect. An aha moment changes your brain circuits like that. How long does it take to change your brain? Pardon. It takes less than .002 of a second. As fast as your neurons can work, your brain can change and that’s how easy it is to change your brain. How long does it take to change your mind? A bit longer, yes. So your brain can change very, very quickly but changing your mind is a completely different story. So that’s your intuition, so the more that you learn and the more techniques that you learn and the more information that you gather, it’s like being a hungry giant taking all the information in. Now you may not even remember that you got it in, but when the occasion demands, your body – your body mind will give it back to you and its like oh! Who said that? I wish I’d thought that before I said it, and it’s absolutely brilliant, but that is not psychic, that does not come from outside you. 

01:00:30
 Isn't that also known as test launch? 

01:00:30
LINDA HANSON Yes. 

01:00:35
 (inaudible ) same thing as test launch? 

01:00:37
LINDA HANSON Yes. Yes, there are lots of different names lots, yes. Well, what do they say you’re taking something 2 billion pieces of information per second but you only process 2,000 or 2 million or something of that. So the rest is all there and this is very evident in your interview because even though you may not address the way a person’s sitting, you may not address the sound of their voice, you may not actually conscious address that, but that is going in and playing bingo somewhere, got it and out it comes and then you say something and you think where did that come from? But it comes from your knowledge, it comes your wisdom, it comes from your experience, it comes from your perception, it comes from your believes and this is why the more work that you can do on yourself and the more clear you are, the more effective you will be as a counselor. So how do you work? Do you work behavioral, cognitive, effective? Do you work body mind? Do you work physically? How do you work? What part of that person do you address? What part of that person do you address? You address the part that needs it at the time and you draw from within yourself the tools and the skills that you have to do so. Now, years ago when I was in England at the cognitive behavioral therapist conference, they were in the process of training 14,000 CBT therapists because CBT had been accepted in England as the modality. Now, I went to that for one lecture that I thought would be interesting, it was a dead waste of time. But there was one that was very, very good. Now this very young girl stood in front of a group like this and went "I’m, uh, beginning to think about emotions. Do you think we as CBT people should think about emotions?" Half the room got up and walked out because they were not prepared to look at emotions. But now, science is finally adding. 

01:03:20
[sil.] 

01:03:25
LINDA HANSON We skipped a couple there, science is finally adding emotions to the mix, attachment, affect regulation, dys-regulation, repair, resilience, body mind, right brain modulation. Now regardless of your angle, your training, your preferred choice of operating, it all boils down firstly to what? It boils down to your perception, what you see and it boils down to your perspective of what you do. 

01:04:00
Lens – could be your own health 

01:04:00
How many people 

01:04:00
believe their own

01:04:00
good quality protein, essential 

01:04:00

01:04:00
good quality carbohydrates? 

01:04:00
suffers aches and pains 

01:04:00
played sport 

01:04:00
been in an accident, had a 

01:04:00
head injury? 

01:04:00
had concussion? 

01:04:00
LINDA HANSON So it becomes very important for your perspective and your perception to be very clear. So take a moment and just think about how you work, do you work intuitively? Now one of the things that's important is to have training to fall back on, on those days when your own health does not allow your intuition to be spot on. So if you have a combination of training and intuition. When you’re spot on when you’re right on, your intuition will be fine. But if you’re not well and you’re having an off day, you need your training, you need the skills so that you are still an effective practioner regardless. I had a mentor who said if you’re not having a good day, don’t go into the office because you maybe able to transfer skills, you maybe able to do it technically, but you cannot heal. And you must ask yourself, are you a practioner who teaches or are you or do you want to be a healer. And anyone who is a counselor I think genuinely wants to be a healer. And there’s a difference between being a counselor with techniques and being a healer. Facial expressions, this is what they did in the 1862, this is the forerunner of working out what expressions are to – what expressions mean. So these poor people went through absolute gross horror electrical stimulation in the name of science. And you can – oh it’s terrible.

LINDA HANSON But now on to the television, who watches Lie to Me? Ah! Did you know that Lie to Me is based on Paul Ekman’s work, it is – he is, yes. So there is a science behind this. Who likes to be Cal Lightman? Okay, Cal Lightman and lets face it all these fit into it now, they’re perfect and they’re right at the end, so we all want to be like that, but Cal Lightman is never wrong, he’s only been wrong once. He is – he can read the micro expressions that his team needs a computer to read. So do you want to be the team that uses a computer or do you want to be Cal Lightman? Do you read the micro expressions? And the next thing is, are these micro expressions common to everyone? That’s the key to this, are they common to everyone? Now he is obsessed with observation, interpretation of micro facial expressions, blissfully unaware of his own expressions, blissfully unaware and if you happen to watch him, he has the most horrendous facial expressions you can imagine. He considers himself the expert, he is the absolute expert on facial expressions, and you know what? He cannot out think his own teenage daughter. The one person who brings him undone is his teenage daughter, because all that he knows and all that he does, does not work with her, do you know why? She can out think him.

LINDA HANSON And that’s what you need to remember with your kids, is they are at the same level you are and unfortunately much smarter, because we as parents have made them that way, so it’s to our credit. This is where age and wisdom will outdo youth and – no wisdom and cunning will outdo youth and vitality every time, it’s got to work. 

01:08:25

01:08:25
LINDA HANSON Looks NCIS if you look -- aha! Yes, NCIS, if we’re looking at detective shows. Now what is that is appealing about NCIS apart from Jethro Gibbs? 

01:08:40
[sil.] 

01:08:45
LINDA HANSON Okay. Jethro, he has excellent observational skills who gets down to atoms of evidence to provide solutions. Oh! Sorry. Jethro, he has excellent observational skills, gathers all the facts but what does he do? He listens to his gut for the final call. So he takes in everything that he can, but his gut, he trusts his gut, alright? Bit of Cal Lightman about him because he does study the micro facial expressions. Abby, oh don’t you love Abby? Abby is a forensic scientist, she has exceptional observational skills and she gets down to atoms of evidence to provide solutions. Tony, Tony quotes a film for very circumstances. He has somewhat unusual observational skills. Now would you provide to be Ziva, just shoot them. If they get in your way, knock them down. If their any trouble, just shoot them. I think there’s a bit of all – bit of Ziva in all of us. Timothy, the computer nerd with heart and soul and who doesn’t love Timothy? Ducky, now Ducky his observation of dead bodies reveals the essential clues to their living. So do you go through the old dead parts of a person’s life to find the clue to their living. He can go through a body, mind you it’s scripted, but he goes through the body and recreates their life just as all of them do. Now if you’re all honest, we got a bit of all of that in us and that’s why that show is the most popular show in America. And I think that the thing that makes this a success and makes you want to watch it more is that it is a family, it is a family of people, they are – there’s no backstabbing, they are supportive, it is a detective show, it’s a medical show, it’s a psychological show and it’s also a family show. It’s interesting. So when you watch that, are you watching it for entertainment? Are you watching it to learn? Are you watching it for comfort? To see, after you’ve spent all day in the office, with dysfunctional families, is it really nice to sit down and watch people get on together and you don’t have to do anything to help them. Are they healing you? Is it fun? Who wouldn’t wanna take Ducky home? I prefer Jethro anyway. Now Numb3rs, who likes Numb3rs? Ah! You like all the detective ones, don’t you? Now what is the principle behind the numbers, we have math, we have techniques, we have strategies, we have formulas, but when you look within this family, this gentlemen here is the numbers, he has all the formulas. These are the detectives, an old detective with wisdom and experience, young detectives who are still making their way. What we have here, how would you describe this one? If anyone knows the show. He is the scientist who is so much of a scientist, he is almost an artist. And by art I mean that he has taken science so far to the point that it comes back around to spirituality. He is the link -- he is the link between straight theory or straight formula, experience and he is all of it combined together. So do you work like that? Do you have your systems? Do you do your training and work with the formulas? Castle, who likes Castle? Do you guys ever get away from the TV? Castle, okay what’s the principles of Castle? He’s a writer, he’s creative and he makes up his – he uses his creativity to solve the crimes. Now, he has a passion for truth in his story and he has excellent observation skills. Now, The Mentalist, who likes The Mentalist? Aha! So what is it about The Mentalist that appeals to you? What part of you is The Mentalist? Because all these shows that you like are just reflecting to you the parts of you that identify with it. So he has exceptional gift for observation, he has mentalist tricks. Now if you watched The Magician last night, that was part science and part trickery, but it was very effective. He’s a hypnotist who doesn’t hesitate to use it when he think it will benefit him and he is also pursuing his own interest. He does a lot of cold – that’s not cold calling, it’s cold – what are they called? Cold analysis, where his exceptional – exceptional observation skills, so can you see that in all of these, the one common thing amongst all of them is their observational skills, the ability to pick up, to see what other people might miss. And the finer your observation skills become, the better that you will be, the easier it will be, your intuition will work, you will absolutely start to clear your own perspectives, you clean your own glasses. Now this one, are you Cesar Millan? Who likes Cesar Millan? I do. He understands species at a really basic level. He knows how to be the pack leader. Who amongst you know that you are the pack leader? Who watches Ceser and goes “Yes, I’m the pack leader”. I watch Ceser, I got out to my dog and I go “Right, I’m the pack leader here”, that’s not actually what I say I tell her I’m the alpha bitch. So he knows how to relate to the client on an individual level. Now mind you, I’m convinced that this man has dog DNA, he has canine DNA and that’s his advantage. But I don’t – I’m quite happy to learn his techniques, because they work and he’s not bad eye candy either. So now we have Oprah. Oprah can relate to everyone suffering because of her own experiences. She can generally keep herself separate from the others but not always because sometime she is sucked in. She has empathy, she feels for them, but you don’t see her get drawn into it, she can let it go or can she? So are you like Oprah? Who likes this lady? Oh! Yes. Oh! Who would like to be like her? This is Judge Judy. Judge Judy doesn’t really listen. She doesn’t take any nonsense and she gets stuck in some pretty questionable cases. However, she’s usually fairly close to the mark but she’s not very popular, she speaks her mind and doesn’t hold back. How many of us have got a bit of Judge Judy in us? How many wish we could – do you know that at one stage in America she had a following larger than Oprah? Why do you think that is? 

01:17:50
 (inaudible ). 

01:17:53
LINDA HANSON Yes, yes. She is doing what half of us will all like to do. So there are lots of other stars, but how to think about the television that you like to watch, television that you relate to. Look at in, uh, from different perspectives and see what you can learn about it. She what, uh, what speaks to you about what you’re watching. Ask your patients what they watch and when you ask them what they watch, you will find out where they’re interest lie. Now 80% of patients get well, doesn’t matter – this is the one from the CBT conference and these are the properties of a good therapist. Now regardless of the modality whether you are – doesn’t matter you discipline, 80% of your patients are going to get better. That’s a bit of a blow, isn’t it. If you had these, openness regarding thoughts and feelings, 80% of patients get well. Why is it so and where does that power come from? So the start of the interview, do you take the case recorded and prescribe a solution. That is the medical model. Do you teach and preach, do you give information, do you work on the educational model or do you discover, listen, learn, receive, exchange, transform, are you a healer? Now, we’re going to play a little bit with perspective just to see if you’re all still awake. 

01:19:50
[sil.] 

01:19:55
LINDA HANSON A few laughs. It’s a case of what do you see? Who sees a car coming towards them? 

01:20:05
The importance of your personal 

01:20:05
style – 

01:20:05
the therapeutic attitude – 

01:20:05
supportive encouragement 

01:20:05
conveying expertise 

01:20:05
involvement 

01:20:05
warmth 

01:20:05
rapport 

01:20:05
empathy 

01:20:05
openness regarding thoughts and feelings and 

01:20:05
emotions 

01:20:05
LINDA HANSON Who sees a car going away from them? Who hasn’t got any idea what they’re looking at all? 

01:20:15
[sil.] 

01:20:20
LINDA HANSON The thing is there are incongruent parts of this car. Have you noticed the – oops! Have you noticed the wheels? The wheel, if you look, the only way that you can cope with that picture is to see parts of it at a time. So if you look here, you can see the car is coming towards you. If you look here, this looks like the back with the wheel – the wheel on the back and the car is going that way. So this is a metaphor for your patients, often you cannot see the whole patient at a time and to deal with that patient, you have to take sections and deal with the sections, but that does not mean that the rest of your patient does not exist. This is where the – the observer determines the reality. This one here, very quickly. 

01:21:20
80 percent of patients get well anyway..... 

01:21:20
Why is it so? 

01:21:20
Where does your power come from? 

01:21:20
LINDA HANSON Tell me what you see, quickly -- don’t look too quickly at it, don’t look to deeply at it. Again. 

01:21:25
 (inaudible ). 

01:21:30
LINDA HANSON Again. 

01:21:30
 My initial instinct is couple of Mexicans. 

01:21:35
LINDA HANSON Couple of Mexicans? Okay. Right, if you look at that just very quickly, you see the old man and the old woman, but on looking closer – more closely, you can see the two Mexicans here, the ear here is a woman in a doorway. So these are optical illusions or metaphors for your patients that there is always something deeper that you can see and it depends on your level of experience, how deeply you can see that. This one what do you see? 

01:22:20
Style of interview 

01:22:20
Do you take the care (record) and prescribe a solution? 

01:22:20
(medical model) 

01:22:20
Do you teach and preach (give information)? 

01:22:20
(educational model) 

01:22:20
Do you discover ( listen, learn, receive, exchange) and 

01:22:20
transform? (healer) 

01:22:20
LINDA HANSON Not sure what you see? 

01:22:20
 Jesus. 

01:22:20
LINDA HANSON Jesus. Okay, can you see – can you see the donkey and the rider? Here, see here this is the seat, here’s the donkey and here’s the rider, here’s his face and his robe and he’s going through a large way. So what you see and what your mind – and this is the difference between perception and perspective, it’s how your brain interprets what you see. This one’s a good one. 

01:23:05
Perspective 

01:23:05
Observations and responsibilities 

01:23:05
LINDA HANSON Especially for Sunday morning. It’s very difficult, it’s very difficult to look, if you didn’t come with a hangover, you will probably think you got one now. So this is where you’re looking at it and you can see the patient but you just can’t kind of get – sorry, get it together. Now this one here, there is a man in this picture if you can see him. Now this is metaphor for your patient when there is something there and they have it hidden and you really have to look for it. So if you like to look then that – oops! Oops! Oops! If you like to look, the key here is the pair of shoes, alright? And he’s painted the same as the tire. So there are some things in your patient you will really, really, really have to look for and in cases like this, it may take you ages or never to find it. And so that is why you must allow for the fact that there are some parts of your patient you may never ever, ever know, but you must allow that it exists. 

01:24:30
Perspective versus logic 

01:24:30
Something can be and not be at the same time 

01:24:30
LINDA HANSON So which circle has the largest color? I’ll put you out of your misery, there are all the same shade. All the circles are the same color. Whatever color you are looking at is dependent on the color around it. A color does not have a color by itself, it is relational to the area around it, do I need to explain that in your patients? Is the book folded towards you or is it folded away from you? You can probably see both but you cannot see both at the same time. This is Young’s complementarity, if you can see one you can’t see the other. This is the quantum physics principle or wave particle. So you cannot grasp these two things together, you can grasp them so quickly sequentially that you think you’ve done it together but you cannot do it together. So this is another perspective in that the – it looks like it’s an oval but this is how it’s drawn so that it looks like that. 

01:25:45
 (inaudible ). 

01:25:50
LINDA HANSON Yes, yes. And let’s – let’s make this clear, if your eye is deceived, if you are seeing something, is that not what you base everything on? So if this is distorted, if this is skewed right from the beginning, everything after that is through that lens and you’ll find it very difficult to see your patient or yourself or your people around you in any other light than what you had originally decided is your perspective. Now this was a very, very fantastic video that’s not going to work. This was also a fantastic video that isn’t going to work. I think my time is up, isn’t it? So is it half past ten? Half past ten? Okay. So you need to consider whether you are client centered or whether you are practitioner centered. And if you are doing a really good interview, a really good session, you will go from one to the other and it is really to your advantage to be aware of when you go from person centered to client centered and not delude yourself into thinking that you are doing one when you’re doing the other. So when you look at your methodologies, quantitative or qualitative, just be aware of what you are doing, there’s nothing wrong with either one of them but it is to your advantage to be a successful practitioner to know and be aware of what you are doing. So what’s your style? Are you medical? Are you spiritual? Are you a teacher? What’s your style? And that ladies and gentlemen is where we will have to finish up. I’m sorry that I didn’t have those two beautiful things to show you, but if you would like to explore that Charlie Chaplin mask for yourself, it’s about the, um, the power of top-down knowledge and that top-down knowledge can actually over ride your sensory input. Just punch in Charlie Chaplin mask and it’s a little two minute thing that will just, uh, finish up what I’ve done here and you will find – I think you will find it very interesting, I think you’ll love it. Good, thank you.
