00:00:00
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. 

00:00:00
Pat Love, Ed.D. 

00:00:40
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. 

00:00:45
PAT LOVE And I'm Pat Love. 

00:00:45
JON CARLSON Like to welcome you to another one of our series on Living Love. This particular episode is gonna be about co-creating a positive relationship. 

00:00:55
PAT LOVE I know I need this one. I mean, this one more than anything else. First of all, co-creating, the fact that you work with your partner, the fact that you, that two people actually create a relationship. And then the positive part, I have to say, I need that. 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON It's such a negative world. 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE Well, you know, 

00:01:10
JON CARLSON The whole world is negative. 

00:01:10
PAT LOVE I've got to thinking about it, and I tend to look for problems. So I see what's wrong and I have a habit of not seeing what's good all the time, and what's right. So I think this is going to be really good for me, personally. 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON Well, we're gonna start out with a quiz, another, another quiz uh, that should help the audience really focus in on whether or not this is appropriate for them and just how appropriate, I think. 

00:01:30
PAT LOVE And the subjects are, I, again, it's really pertinent. The first one, acceptance, um, I don't know. There's a part of me, I can't to talk to Dick Stuart about this because, first of all, he has a wealth of information and so pertinent, so relevant. But t-, why I have a resistance to acceptance, first, when I, when I first saw that word, there was something about me that went, I, it took my breath, and I somehow have a resistance around that, so I wanna look at that cuz I, I, I really believe it's important. 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON Then we're gonna learn how to care. We're gonna do caring days activities to learn how to increase the positives that go on between us. 

00:02:10
PAT LOVE And how to get my partner to care for me in the right way. That's important. 

00:02:10
JON CARLSON And then we'll talk about how to negotiate, you know, living in a, a, a world of relationships that really don't have uh, roles and rules, and we need to know how to negotiate to have the kind that we want. 

00:02:25
PAT LOVE Yeah, a win-win negotiation. I'm looking forward to that piece, too. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON And, and then we'll finish up with a, a, an important piece on just this whole notion of how to fantasize. 

00:02:35
PAT LOVE I know, and how to do that, how to do future talk in a, in a fantasy way that bonds two people. I often call that the third force in marriage, that there's something really positive pulling us along. And I love, love fantasizing.

Co-creating a Positive Relationship 

00:02:55
featuring Richard Stuart, D.S.W. 

00:03:00
RICHARD STUART I go back and remind myself that this is not what I would be doing on a second date. And I start treating her as though she really mattered to me, and then she responds positively. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON Dick Stuart will be out in a minute, but why don't we move on uh, to go to the quiz? 

00:03:15
PAT LOVE Try the quiz. Okay. Just to focus us on looking at your positive or negative attitude about your relationship, we want you to give just a short answer, and these answers are going to come up like, off the top of your head. So just think about whatever comes to your mind first, we want you to jot it down. And this is the first question. 

00:03:30
Quiz Short Answer 

00:03:30
1. When you think of your relationship, would you describe it as positive or negative? 

00:03:35
PAT LOVE When you think of your relationship, would you describe it as positive or negative? 

00:03:40
2. Why did you choose your partner? What attracted you to him or her? 

00:03:40
JON CARLSON The second question is, why did you choose your partner? What attracted you to him or her? 

00:03:50
PAT LOVE Yeah. Short answers. Okay. 

00:03:50
3. If you could change one thing about your relationship that could make it more positive what would that thing be? 

00:03:50
PAT LOVE The third question is, if you could change just one thing about your relationship that could make it more positive, what would that one thing be? 

00:04:00
4. What one thing would you like your partner to accept more in you? 

00:04:05
JON CARLSON The fourth question is, what's one thing that you'd like your partner to accept more in you? 

00:04:10
PAT LOVE Yeah, I can't wait to answer that one. You know, it's like, only one? I've got to limit it to one? But then, on the other hand, number 5, 

00:04:20
JON CARLSON The flip. 

00:04:20
5. What one thing could you be more accepting of in your partner? 

00:04:20
PAT LOVE What one thing could you be more accepting of in your partner? 

00:04:25
FRANK With the 4 and 5, when I saw those questions, I said, "Boy, those are dangerous questions." If I say this, she'll go, "What!" 

00:04:35
PAT LOVE Yeah, it's different with your partner sitting right there. I could look real good with my partner up here. Unfortunately, Jon knows him. 

00:04:50
DELLA It's real easy for me to say what I need and what he should do. It's a little hard for me to say what one thing could I do to be more accepting of him. 

00:05:00
MARY KAY And when we were first married, I'd get my big book out if we had an argument, and I'd read page 449 which is all about acceptance. And that really helped me, and then I would share it with him and, 

00:05:10
JOHN She taught me. 

00:05:10
MARY KAY And I'd say, "Well, I need to accept this about you more," and then, you know, we both started doing it, so. 

00:05:15
JON CARLSON Let's move on to the next sets of questions have yes or no answers, not short answers. 

00:05:20
Quiz Yes or No 

00:05:20
6. Do you make your relationship a priority with your time? 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON And question number 6 is, do you make your relationship a priority with your time? In other words, do you walk the walk, or do you just talk the talk? 

00:05:35
PAT LOVE This, this guy has a way of making the rubber hit the road. He's asking all these questions that make me squirm a little. 

00:05:40
7. Do you and your partner discuss basic values and goals? 

00:05:40
PAT LOVE Okay, number 7. Do you and your partner discuss basic values and goals? Do you really talk about this? Do you let each other know about it? 

00:05:50
8. Do you and your partner have a positive way of dealing with "touchy subjects"? 

00:05:55
JON CARLSON Que-, question number 8. Do you and your partner have a positive way of dealing with those touchy subjects? Positive way of dealing with touchy subjects. 

00:06:10
PAT LOVE A feeling my husband's going to be making me watch this tonight. 

00:06:15
9. Do you and your partner have a positive way of making decisions? 

00:06:15
PAT LOVE Number 9, do you and your partner have a positive way of making decisions? 

00:06:20
10. Overall, does your relationship seem fair to you? 

00:06:25
JON CARLSON This next question is, is, is, is a very interesting one. Question number 10. Overall, does your relationship seem fair to you? Fair to you. No laughing. Fair. 

00:06:40
PAT LOVE You know, kids figure this out early on. What's fair and what's not fair. 

00:06:40
JON CARLSON They do. 

00:06:45
PAT LOVE They'll tell you. 

00:06:45
11. Do you and your partner make it a habit to fantasize and dream about future plans? 

00:06:45
PAT LOVE Number 11. Do you and your partner make it a habit to fantasize and dream about future plans? 

00:06:50
JULIUS Not a habit. We do dream, we do discuss it, but we don't make a point and effort to uh, dwell upon it. 

00:06:55
12. Do you make a conscious effort to create a positive relationship? 

00:07:00
JON CARLSON 12, and final question is, do you make a conscious effort to create a positive relationship? 

00:07:10
PAT LOVE And Dick really has some information that's incredible. It changed the way I view decision making and acceptance, especially when I heard the piece on acceptance, it really hit home with me. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON Why don't we get on to uh, getting Dick out here and uh, letting the audience meet him? 

00:07:25
PAT LOVE Yeah, let him give us some answers. 

00:07:30
JON CARLSON We'd like to welcome Dick Stuart with us who's gonna help us learn how to co-create a positive relationship. When I think of these positive relationships, I'm wondering, if you have a positive relationship, is your marriage gonna be any more satisfying? 

00:07:45
PAT LOVE Well, according to research, it is. That we need more positives than negatives, right? 

00:07:50
RICHARD STUART Sure, and it takes two people to make a marriage positive, just as it takes two people to make it not so good. So marriage is really a process of co-creation. You co-create the goods and unfortunately, you co-create the bads, too. 

00:08:00
PAT LOVE But you know, the thing that I, I worry about, I have to, I wanna confess in the beginning here. That there's a part of me that says, first of all, that I look for problems, you know, that's my job, but the second thing is, there's a part of me that thinks, if I just focus on the positives, it'll go away. That somehow, that if I think it's too wonderful, it, I know it's like distorted thinking or something, but I have this fear that if I think it's so wonderful, it'll go away. Am I normal, or, I mean. 

00:08:30
RICHARD STUART Well, I don't know if you're normal, but, uh, it makes sense to uh, concentrate, really, on the positives because the only way that we can make negative behaviors go away is to replace them with a positive. You can't make things not happen. You don't create vacuums in relationships. You just replace the things you don't like with the things that you like more. 

00:08:50
JON CARLSON Well, maybe we should start at the beginning. You know, why, why do people choose the partners that they choose? You know, a lot of times you see very positive people, optimistic people, they go and they find somebody who's a sad sack, somebody who's very pessimistic. What brings people together, Dick? 

00:09:10
RICHARD STUART Good question, Jon. There's two reasons that people marry. Sometimes people marry to solve personal problems. They decide it's time to have children, they have a pregnancy they can't deal with otherwise, they don't feel they can make it on their own, they're of an age where all their friends are getting married and they will look like misfits if they don't. So those folks choose the most available person uh, and they get married, and those are not really the marriages made in heaven. There're other marriages where people find a partner that they really wanna spend their life with. They like what they know about this person. And those are the more solid marriages because there're a lot fewer compromises that have to be made. So uh, there's a timing element in all marriages. I don't think we necessarily marry the person we love the most in all of life. We marry the person we love the most at the time we decide to marry. But you can marry a person who fits well with you, or you can marry a person who simply is uh, a peg to fill a slot that's gotta be filled. 

00:10:15
PAT LOVE Okay, now wait. So, let me see if I've got this, cuz this sounds real important. That, if you marry to solve a problem, you're likely to have more difficulty with that relationship, with that, with that marriage. And if you're, and would it be fair to say, if I'm expecting, then, the marriage to solve my problems, that that may be conflictual or unrealistic. Whereas, if I really choose a partner, and I know when you talk about the future fantasy, that, that we plan a life together and the decision-making you talk about, win-win, that that's, that's a focus, that if we somehow think of, okay, what's important to us and co-create it together, then that's much more likely to be satisfying? 

00:10:55
RICHARD STUART Right. If you choose a partner to solve one problem, you usually end up creating many others. If you want a marriage to work well, you really have to find a partner who shares basic values with you. And that means that if, for example, one of you is really spiritual and the other is an atheist, you're gonna have a very difficult time because there're gonna be daily conflicts. If one of you really lives to have children and the other doesn't feel that uh, there's time enough in life uh, for kids, then that's gonna be a major problem. Often when you, marriage to solve a problem, you don't do that inventory, you don't look for similarities in basic values. Also, to make a marriage work, you have to have styles that are complementary. Values have to be the same, the ones that are most important to you, but styles have to be different. Usually, uh, if one person is very future-oriented, it's very nice if the other person uh, likes to spend some, pay attention to the present. If one likes to save for the future, one should like to have uh, pleasant uh, uh, things happening now. If one is very neat, it's very nice if the other is a little bit more casual. Normally, we marry somebody who makes us feel very comfortable uh, because of that complementarity, and then we start to fight about those things as soon as we're married. Uh, the prototypic situation is the uh, uh, guy that is really, this is gonna sound very stereotyped, and I apologize for that, the guy that's very hardworking and meets this woman that really has, knows how to have a good time. Um, he loves the fact that she can enjoy life. She loves the fact that he's organized and career-oriented. They get married, and she complains that he's a workaholic, and he complains that she's a party gal. Okay, uh, the fact that one likes to have a good time and one likes to work is a strength in the marriage. It's not a liability. The couple have to learn the third set, the third element to make a good marriage work, which is the ability to negotiate two-winner outcomes to how to resolve a style for the couple that will work. 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON Yeah. So regardless of how you get, whether it's method one or method two, that you get together, I'm of the assumption that you still can have a good marriage, a good, positive relationship? 

00:13:25
RICHARD STUART Every marriage can be made better. Uh, not every marriage can be made good enough. That's a question that couples have to constantly examine for themselves and, and, and work on. But I've never met a, never found a marriage yet that can't be improved. 

00:13:40
PAT LOVE Now, something you, you mentioned that uh, I have a question about, and that is, acceptance because, as you're saying, there're gonna be differences and you want differences that, that make, that's part of the attraction. I've often heard that you resist the most that which you need the most. That if I'm the party girl, I may need a partner that's more stable and, and that gives me stability and the rudder to my boat and so forth. So, and yet, that might attract me to you, but I resist it later on. So, part of what you're saying is about acceptance. That, that there are some things you need to accept and I, when I heard that, I have to tell you, I, I got, I got uncomfortable. What, I mean, what is it that's so hard about acceptance? 

00:14:25
RICHARD STUART Well, acceptance can be overdone. Uh, there are some things that are really very threatening to you, that are very insulting for you that really shouldn't be accepted. They should be changed. Most of the things that couples quarrel about don't fall in that category, are much more irritations. If I may, can I tell you a story? Uh, my wife and I bought a new, bought a car the day we got married. The car is now 17 years old and it's kind of ailing. It was time to have its transmission replaced. Leaving for work one day, and I said, "I'll drop the car off at AAA transmission. Would you please pick me up on the way into the office?" Uh, 20 minutes to 9:00, I was still standing on the street corner. Called my wife in the office, and I said, "Hey, honey, did you forget anything today?" She said, "Well, I have my lunch, I've got my briefcase." I said, "No, forget anything else?" 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON Just like that, you said this? Okay. 

00:15:15
RICHARD STUART Right. She said, "Oh, I, I was supposed to pick you up." I said, "Right. Would you mind please coming back and getting me cuz I have no other way to get to work." Now, uh, my wife's style is one in which she is very linear. She is wonderful at starting something and following it through to the end. That's one of the things I loved about her when I married her. I'm very different. Uh, I, I look crossectionally, I see things in the broad picture, and I miss all the details. In the past, I used to get very angry and feel very rejected because Barbara paid attention to what she was doing and didn't pay attention to me. I've learned that I've gotta accept that in her, that it's actually one of the strengths in our marriage. She has to in-, accept in me the fact that while she's on the phone, I often do ask her, uh, start a separate conversation with her because I tend to do more, several things at once. So uh, very often, what people quarrel about, what they feel as, kind of mortal wounds, personal injustices, are just aspects of the other person's style. And it's extremely important in a loving relationship to, to benevolently accept those. 

00:16:30
PAT LOVE Wow. 

00:16:30
JON CARLSON Can you, can you do that? I mean, can you, is, is it acceptance or is it tolerance? I, you know, I'm not sure the difference between that. And can you do it honestly? 

00:16:40
RICHARD STUART Tolerance, there's a, I'm really glad you asked that. Tolerance implies that there's something wrong with it and this is a cross you have to bear. Acceptance says, there's nothing wrong with it, that's just part of who she is. It's part of what attracted me to her in the first place. So uh, if you tolerate something, then you are always uneasy about it. Uh, you're, it always costs you. If you accept something, it's a, it's a gift of love. 

00:17:05
JON CARLSON So you wanna find, you wanna, you wanna find that difference, then, and, and, and accept it as beautiful? 

00:17:10
RICHARD STUART Yes. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE And when we did the quiz, I, I felt such uh, energy when the, the question was, what would you like your partner to accept more about you? And I know when I, my heels start to dig in every now and then, I start to say, well, do I have imperfections I want my partner to accept? And that helps me get energy for accepting, and ma-, and my mother used to say, "Pick your battles," you know? It's like you, you get so much airtime, what are you going to speak, what, what issues are you going to focus on and make those a priority. 

00:17:40
RICHARD STUART Let me give an illustration of something that I don't think you should accept. Let's assume that your husband drives too fast, and it makes you very nervous. Now, somebody might say, "Well, Pat, just relax, uh, go with the flow." I would say no. Uh, it's not reasonable to expect you to adjust to driving through uh, uh, the highways at 80 miles an hour. That's something that oughta be changed and not accepted. Everybody has to decide what should they accept and what should they negotiate as part of the package of changes. 

00:18:15
PAT LOVE Well, do you have, like, criteria? Is it dangerous, is it lethal, is is a- 

00:18:20
RICHARD STUART Keep going. 

00:18:20
PAT LOVE I mean, I mean, those are- 

00:18:20
RICHARD STUART You're doing well, those work. 

00:18:20
PAT LOVE Is it against the law? I mean, you know. 

00:18:20
RICHARD STUART How hurt-, how hurtful is it? 

00:18:25
PAT LOVE How hurtful is it? 

00:18:25
RICHARD STUART Is it, is it genuinely hurtful or is it hurtful because you label it in a way? I could have labeled Barbara's not picking me up as being complete indifference to me or I could label it as her, as her style. 

00:18:40
PAT LOVE My girlfriend has a question. She said, "Before you get upset about something, ask yourself this question, can you spot it from an airplane at 20,000 feet?" 

00:18:45
RICHARD STUART That's great. 

00:18:50
PAT LOVE Now, if you can't spot it from an airplane, maybe ought to reconsider giving, working yourself up. 

00:18:55
RICHARD STUART But here's another criteria: what are you willing to trade to get it? Are you willing, how, how much are you willing to do differently in order to get your partner to do something differently? Uh, I believe that in all relationships, change is always bilateral. Uh, it always is important to pay for what you get by making changes to accommodate uh, the other. So, if it isn't worth your making a significant change to achieve, then it's not worth asking your part-, demanding of your partner that kind of concession. 

00:19:30
JON CARLSON So acceptance is, is really an important part of positive relationships. It, is this, I guess, I guess I'm still not really clear on it. Is this like the AA prayer thing, or the AA that you give me the, you know, courage to change what I can, accept what I can't, and. 

00:19:45
RICHARD STUART AA is wonderful and it works for the people for whom it works. What we're talking about here is somewhat different. Uh, here we're really talking about an act of love. What is says is, I have chosen you as a person I wanna be with. I don't deliver perfection, I don't expect perfection. I understand that some of the things you do are dif-, or you do things, some things differently than the way I do. That doesn't make you wrong and me right. Uh, out of caring for you, I'm willing to adjust my approach to these problems. I genuinely accept your approach to them is an expression of who you are. 

00:20:25
JON CARLSON A gift. 

00:20:25
RICHARD STUART It's a gift. 

00:20:25
PAT LOVE Well, I find that, that, that, that giving a gift is so much easier when I feel cared for or, and, and I think that goes to what you're talking about, co-creating a positive relationship. When I fell positive, it's like it's no skin off my nose, you know? I can do it. It's like I can cut my partner slack. It's not hard. It's when we're in a bad place that, 

00:20:50
RICHARD STUART 'Kay, now you're getting into something that's really very interesting and, I think, very important, and it's the probably single most important and easiest to accomplish change uh, in co-creating a positive relationship. Many, many people are complacent about their relationships. They don't put very much energy into making them better, and they feel very hurt that their partner doesn't do it. So I think- 

00:21:15
JON CARLSON Mutual apathy. 

00:21:15
RICHARD STUART That's right, it is mutual apathy. So, I really encourage people to put a significant amount of effort into trying to make their marriage, create in their marriage the climate that they want. Now I've gotta tell you another story. Sorry about the stories. 

00:21:30
PAT LOVE I like stories. 

00:21:30
RICHARD STUART I was with two friends uh, in New York not too long ago. On separate nights we had dinner and both of them asked the same question. I made the same response, and they had the same uh, reaction. Said, "How are you?" I said, "I'm as happy as a pig in mud." And they said, "Wait a minute. How, how can you say that? You are, a year, couple years ago you said you were having trouble in your marriage." And I said, "Well a couple of years ago, we were, and now we're not." I said, "Now I feel like we're on a second date." And they say, "Oh, oh, we don't believe you. That's baloney. What's your secret?" Said, "It's really simple. We treat each other as though we're on our second date." In a loving relationship, you don't, most people expect to feel they did on the second date, but they don't really expect to put the energy into courtship. I think a loving relationship is a never-ending courtship in which people constantly look for small, high-frequency, symbolically powerful ways of expressing their recognition, affection, caring, love for each other. 

00:22:40
PAT LOVE Now, does that mean I have to work, work at it? I mean, there's a part of me that feels like that sounds, that I have to be conscious, I'm gonna have to think about it, I'm gonna have to be looking for ways. Um, but my hunch is, if I don't do that, it's gonna be worse. 

00:22:55
JON CARLSON I think it calls for energy, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be effortless. 

00:22:55
RICHARD STUART That's an excellent question. 

00:22:55
PAT LOVE I know, I know, I know. 

00:23:00
RICHARD STUART Here, here is the wisdom of the ages for you. It takes less effort to have a good marriage than a bad one. In a bad marriage, you put a tremendous amount of energy into thinking about what's wrong and how you wish it were different, you feel terrible, you get, you don't sleep as well, you act testily with the kids, you don't perform as well at work. If, on the other hand, you put energy into building a positive connection with your spouse, you do have to think about it every day, but the amount of time that you'll spend thinking about it is much less than the amount that you would in invest in feeling sorry for yourself in a relationship that's gone sour. 

00:23:40
JON CARLSON This, this whole dialogue seems to be predicated on good, positive communication. Is, is that the, but, but we talk about communication in such a way that uh, no one really knows what it is. When you think of communication, what does that mean to you? 

00:24:00
RICHARD STUART Communication's a clich�. Every couple that comes into my office, I say, "What, what you need to make it better?" and they say "We have a communication problem." And that, that tends to be uh, the shade that's pulled down over the reality. When I think of communication, it involves a few very important steps. 

00:24:15
Three Keys to Good Communication Be clear about your constructive message Encode it in your partner's language Clarify messages you receive 

00:24:15
RICHARD STUART First of all, you have to figure out what message you wanna send. Secondly, you have to figure out everything you know about your partner and send the message in a way that is in your partner's language. Third, you have to be able to understand your partner's response. Don't assume you know the meaning. Ask questions and get, and get it clear. Communication is about getting the message sent and received accurately, and it's another skill set. 

00:24:45
PAT LOVE How can you really know what your partner wants? 

00:24:50
RICHARD STUART Only by asking. And asking again and asking again because your partner isn't gonna necessarily want the same thing two hours from now. 

00:25:00
PAT LOVE Okay. So that's the ongoing, and as you were describing it, Dick, it really, I, I really got it. That it makes sense to me that, if I'm gonna need to put effort in, I feel better when it's positive effort. I'm , I, I mean, I've lived long enough now to know that if I'm thinking negatively, it's, it's destructive to me, not just the relationship. But I just don't feel as good when I'm thinking negatively as when I'm thinking positively. 

00:25:25
RICHARD STUART Every time I feel that Barbara and I are drifting off from one another, I go back, remind myself that this is not what I would be doing on a second date. And I start treating her as though she really mattered to me, and then she responds positively, and then she really matters to me. 

00:25:40
PAT LOVE Oh, okay. 

00:25:45
JON CARLSON I have a, kind of a final question and, and I'm wondering how, how do we assess what a good marriage is? And I don't know, what is a good, positive marriage? A few years ago, it was pretty easy because it was role-driven. You know, if the woman had children, and a man owned a house, we would check "good marriage," "positive marriage." What is a positive relationship from your point of view? 

00:26:10
RICHARD STUART Let me use an analogy for a second. There are introverts and there are extroverts. Introverts get really drained when they're in groups and extroverts get energized. In a good marriage, you really get drained when you're with your partner, in a, in a uh, bad marriage, rather, you really get drained when you're, when you're with your partner. In a good marriage, you really feel energized. Your marriage becomes a platform for richness in your life. In a bad marriage, uh, energy is drained from your life. You don't do other things nearly as well as you could otherwise, you don't have that same happiness, that same joyful outlook. So, it is a softer criteria than "he brings home the bacon and she bakes the pie." 

00:26:55
JON CARLSON Wow, so it sounds like a positive relationship is an energizing one. 

00:26:55
RICHARD STUART Yes. 

00:27:00
JON CARLSON Well, let's get some more energy into our discussion and open up to questions from our studio audience. They've been patiently waiting and listening. What reactions do you have to the comments that Dick has been making about co-creating positive relationships. 

00:27:15
JULIUS I like the idea about the diversity in styles. Um, one partner's one way and another partner could be another way, and that you attribute that, or that you look at that as a strength. I kind of uh, looked at it as being a liability to the relationship, since I'm "casual," you call it. I call it "sloppy." She's very neat. 

00:27:35
RICHARD STUART And you call it obsession. 

00:27:40
JULIUS Yeah, but, I never though of it as a strength, but as I see it now, it would be kind of boring, both of us trying to beat each other to wash the dishes and they'd pick up clothes and stuff like that. Um, that's kinda interesting to me. 

00:27:55
RICHARD STUART I really like the idea of specializing in marriages. People should do what they're good at. And that doesn't mean that everybody should everything. Uh, you kind of think through what comes most naturally to each of you, and you allocate those uh, responsibilities to the person who's best at doing, for whom it comes most naturally. I did a national study of 4,400 couples and one of the questions I asked was, what percentage of the work of keeping this family going do you do? The average man said 72%, the average wife said 78%. Now, you wanna know why America is great? Of 148% of what has to get done, we do. Everybody thinks they do more than 50%. That's just a reality. Um, uh, it isn't true, but it's a reality. What matters is if uh, people have to negotiate with each other to find a balance uh, that really feels equitable. 

00:28:55
BRETT I threw that word, "bashful," out to my wife one day. She, she's a great cook and I was kinda getting away with her doing the dishes right then. She's like, "You know, why am I always doing the dishes? I'm doing the cooking," and I go, "Doesn't it come natural to you?" and I almost got a pan thrown right at me. You gotta watch when you say "natural." 

00:29:20
DELLA There are some, there are some things that just both people don't want to do. You know, neither of us want to do the dishes. I mean, I can't tell you how many times all the dishes, all the dishes, have been out on the counter, you know, every single thing, but rinsed off and on the counter or in the dishwasher. 

00:29:35
BRETT But I built you a big counter. 

00:29:40
DELLA But no. 

00:29:40
ARLISS And a big dishwasher too! 

00:29:40
DELLA And an island, too. 

00:29:45
BRETT And an island too. 

00:29:45
DELLA But, you know, it's like, he doesn't wanna do them, but, you know, I don't wanna do them either cuz he doesn't wanna do them and I don't wanna do them and, and then what happens with those things. Those are the hard, those are the hard things. 

00:29:55
RICHARD STUART Make a list. Make a list of all the things that are hard for uh, each of you to do and then start negotiating and figure out how you can cut deals that will be affective. 

00:30:10
JON CARLSON We're gonna talk about that later on, aren't we? 

00:30:10
RICHARD STUART Yes, we are. 

00:30:15
JON CARLSON Teach about that skill of negotiating. 

00:30:15
RICHARD STUART We're gonna talk about how to do two-winner negotiation. In uh, our relationship, uh, um, one of the best forms of foreplay available to me is vacuuming the living room. Any time I do a task which Barbara considers to be traditionally women's work, without being uh, nagged or prodded, or suggested. If I take out the vacuum on a Saturday morning, Barbara will say to me, "Oh, you wanna get cozy tonight, don't you?" Um, uh, uh. 

00:30:50
JON CARLSON It's time to get to work and move on with our first series of excercises. 

00:30:55
RICHARD STUART Let's do it. 

00:31:00
[sil.] 

00:31:00
Co-creating a Positive Relationship 

00:31:00
Exercise 1 Acceptance 

00:31:05
JON CARLSON Well, we've all had a good night's sleep and had a chance to come back, uh, ready to learn. Uh, in this segment of the program, what's gonna happen is uh, Dick's gonna have an opportunity to teach various skills. The first on will be that of acceptance and have a chance to teach it to our studio audience with the hope that the viewing audience will be able to look on and will be able to do these same activities at home. 

00:31:30
PAT LOVE I'm ready. 

00:31:30
Keys to Acceptance 

00:31:30
Insight: know yourself Understanding: respectfully know your partner 

00:31:30
RICHARD STUART Oh, wow. Okay, uh, to begin with, there are a few basic principles of acceptance that I'd like to share with you. Uh, you can't be accepting of others until you have some insight into what your own strengths and, and weaknesses are. And you really have to have an understanding of who the other is and, and uh, what works for that person and, and what are some of the challenges. Now, uh, everybody believes their partner, no matter how much you love each other, each of you wishes the other would do some things differently. Uh, sometimes, one is concerned that the partner is uh, late too often. Sometimes, it's messy. Sometimes it's uh, too close to uh, uh, uh, family parents or other people. Uh, often times, men complain that their wives are uh, have, spend too much time with their friends. Or wives com-, complain that their husbands spend too much time with sports on TV. Uh, we all want changes in each other. One of the hard issues for every couple, every, every married person to decide, is, how much is fair to ask a partner to change? Uh, and uh, the reciprocal of that is, how much do you accept? Acceptance is wonderful because uh, it provides a lot of validation for each other. Uh, you know, you wanna be able to come home and relax. Uh, you wanna feel that your partner loves who you are. You don't wanna have to constantly be uh, defensive and, and um, feel that you're on trial. So in a, uh, one of the gifts that partners can give each other that is invaluable is the gift of acceptance. 

00:33:25
Activity Personal's Ad 

00:33:25
Write a personal's ad for yourself listing your attractive features. Write a personal's ad for your partner listing his/her strengths. 

00:33:25
RICHARD STUART So the point here is for you to be able to write a personals ad to get some insight into your strengths, write a personals ad for your partner in order to build some understanding of what your partner's uh, strengths are, and then we wanna talk about how to make some decisions about whether to accept some of your concerns about your partner or attempt to change them. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:33:55
Please Pause Here & Write 

00:34:00
KIM Well, for one thing, I found it easier to write other things about my husband than about myself. 

00:34:05
RICHARD STUART That's interesting. 

00:34:05
KIM I wrote that I'm kind, creative, intelligent, loving, hard-working, and an optimist. 

00:34:15
RICHARD STUART Okay. And what'd you like about Cy? 

00:34:15
KIM He's kind, sincere, rational, intelligent, stable and hard-working, supportive, and a realist. 

00:34:25
RICHARD STUART And, well, what do you wish he'd do a little differently? 

00:34:30
KIM Um, well, I wish he'd spend more time um, doing family activities. 

00:34:35
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

00:34:40
KIM With me and the children. 

00:34:40
RICHARD STUART And you ask him to do that? What does he do with his time when he's not spending time with you and the kids? 

00:34:50
KIM Work. 

00:34:50
RICHARD STUART Cy, what do you like about her? 

00:34:50
CY What do I like about her? 

00:34:55
RICHARD STUART Yep. 

00:34:55
CY Oh. Well, like, me, she's hard-working. Uh, just around the house with all the children. She's very caring. She's educated. She always goes above and beyond what is really called for. She's good-natured, committed. Um, she's a do-gooder, she's always doing something good for someone else. And, she's a very patient individual. 

00:35:20
RICHARD STUART Sounds wonderful. Um, what'd you write about yourself? 

00:35:25
CY Hard-working, that's about it. Hard-working and very goal-orientated. 

00:35:30
RICHARD STUART And if you could make any change at all you wanted in Kim, what would she be? What would be different? 

00:35:40
CY Um, that, that's a very difficult one. Um, probably to leave some of the things on the outside of our lifestyle or home life. She gets involved in too many outside activities. And she's already have, has a, a st-, a range top full of pots and pans, and she's trying to put more pots and pans on an already-full stove. 

00:36:05
RICHARD STUART Okay. So why do you think she does that? 

00:36:10
CY She's a good person. Probably to try to make up for the time I'm not there. 

00:36:15
RICHARD STUART Why does he work so hard? 

00:36:20
KIM To support us. 

00:36:20
RICHARD STUART Good reasons? 

00:36:25
KIM Oh, yeah. 

00:36:25
RICHARD STUART So is it better for you to try to help him change that, or would it be better to recognize that that's his way of doing his job, as he perceives it. 

00:36:40
KIM Um, we've talked about, and I know it's his way of, you know, being a good provider, is how he sees his role. And it's definitely an important role that I couldn't fulfill myself, you know, without him. I do see that. 

00:36:55
RICHARD STUART And while you're, while you're doing all of this hard work, uh, you identified the fact that it's important for Kim to fill that time with some sorts of activities that are satisfying to her and she wants to make a contribution to the community. Would you really want her to change that? 

00:37:15
CY Uh, probably not. I realize that she needs to use her spirit time creatively, but she still goes, I think, beyond filling her time. It's like there's only 24 hours in a day and she's trying to do 30 hours worth of work in that 24 hours. 

00:37:30
RICHARD STUART Okay, and is that a problem for her or for you? 

00:37:35
CY Problem for her. I, I perceive it as a problem for her. 

00:37:40
RICHARD STUART Okay, so if she's willing to accept the cost of doing it, even though the cost to her might be high, that would really be acceptable to you. 

00:37:50
CY Yes. 

00:37:50
RICHARD STUART Okay. I doubt that this couple ever puts on the boxing gloves and dukes it out. Um, but it's a, it's a great illustration of where acceptance would, would really be a loving and benevolent choice. Um, anybody else? 

00:38:10
JULIUS I think that if I could just pay more attention to how I am taking care of my things, I think that would make her life a little bit more pleasant. 

00:38:15
RICHARD STUART Does Arliss complain about that? 

00:38:20
JULIUS She doesn't always complain, but she's got these looks. She's got this message. And then if I don't kinda respond to that message, um, she gives me the silent treatment. 

00:38:30
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

00:38:30
JULIUS "Honey, you uh, are you hungry? Ah, you're not talking?" Then I look at the floor where my shoes are, my coat, I say, "Okay, then, I kinda get the picture." So. 

00:38:40
RICHARD STUART Could, could you give him a look, please? 

00:38:45
ARLISS My mother used to give this look, I got it from her. 

00:38:50
RICHARD STUART Ah, do you think he's a little too careless. 

00:38:55
ARLISS No, I don't think he's careless. I think, honestly I think I might be too far on one end of the spectrum and I think he may be a little too far on the other. And I think it's okay for me to come the other way. One of the things that um, we've discussed is that he believes he works all day, he should come home and be able to relax, and that's very true. Me, on the other hand, I need to learn how to relax. And when I come home, I find everything else that needs to get done, I feel everything has to get done today. And he's been working to teach me, well, why does it have-, and he as-, he'll ask me this question. Does it have to get done today? And I'll think about that and I'm, 

00:39:35
JULIUS From 1 to 10, how, how, how important is this that it gets done today? 

00:39:35
ARLISS Yeah, and he's right. 

00:39:35
JULIUS Ten. (crosstalk)It's never, it's never nine, never eight. 

00:39:40
ARLISS Really, it doesn't, I mean, the earth is not gonna stop if I don't get it done today. I can really put this on tomorrow's platter. And I'm kinda learning that everything does not have to get done today, that it might be more important that I spend some time with him in the evenings than trying to get all these different things done. I'm a very goal-oriented person. I'm trying to achieve certain things and I want to, you know, get certain items uh, off my checklist, done for the day. And I don't put enough of him in my checklist. And so, that's what I'm kind of learning. And it's frustrating. I'm not gonna say that it's not, it's very frustrating sometimes, but I'm learning to accept him, that he needs his relaxation and I may need some of it, too. And so it's a growing kind of relationship. 

00:40:25
RICHARD STUART I love the way you des-, the way you both describe it because what you're doing is articulating the core principle on acceptance, which is choice or decisions. You have to make a, you have to make worth-it decisions. So Julius decides is it worth uh, going out of his way to pick up his shoes and, and, and put 'em where Arliss would like to find them. She decides is this, is this uh, is it really worth it to get this done at the cost of spending time with Julius. And, so what you're doing is giving a beautiful illustration to Harville Hendrix's concept of a conscious relationship in which you don't do things on autopilot, but you decide, you make some choices. And you make the choices based on what you understand about the other and insights into yourself. And you both articulate so beautifully. You're balancing insight into "I like to relax." "I tend to be compulsive." Understanding "She likes to get things done and he likes to be casual." And then, you make some choices about what actions to take. And that's, that, it could not be done better. 

00:41:40
RICHARD STUART I think it's always important to begin by, with an inventory of what you like. Uh, that puts change into a meaningful context. So, Della, what do you like about Brett? 

00:41:55
DELLA Um, you want me to go through my answer? 

00:41:55
RICHARD STUART Sure, please. 

00:41:55
DELLA Um, has dreams, has a sense of humor, is dedicated, strong, and is sexual. 

00:42:00
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

00:42:05
BRETT Well. 

00:42:05
RICHARD STUART And uh, so you put that in your personals ad for him? 

00:42:10
DELLA Yeah, that's gonna go in the ad. 

00:42:10
RICHARD STUART What do you like about Della? 

00:42:15
BRETT Uh, I put that she's good-looking. She's intelligent, outgoing, energetic, and romantic. 

00:42:20
RICHARD STUART Okay. Sounds wonderful. Now, what do you wish that she, what would you, if she were the most perfect woman in the universe, now I realize that she is, but if you were to be even better, what would you change? 

00:42:30
BRETT Uh, I don't like when I ask her a question when I'm in the kitchen and she's in the family room and she decides that she's just not gonna answer that question. 

00:42:40
RICHARD STUART Okay, for example, what might be, think of an illustration of when that, when that happens. 

00:42:50
BRETT Sure, um, I come in from work, and I'll say, "Della, how was your day?" And that'll be the response. 

00:43:00
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

00:43:00
BRETT And I'll say, "Was that a question where you don't give an answer, or?" So. 

00:43:05
RICHARD STUART Uh, guilty as charged, Della? 

00:43:10
DELLA Yeah. Yes, I do that. 

00:43:15
RICHARD STUART Uh, any idea why? 

00:43:15
DELLA Um, it's sometimes I just don't have the answer right away for the question that he asks. And he likes my answers so, he likes to be answered so immediately, and sometimes I'm just not there to answer that question. 

00:43:30
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

00:43:30
DELLA You know, I, I might, I, my thoughts aren't there. Or I may be just doing something that I need to think about what I'm doing and so it just takes time for it to process. Other times I don't have an answer yet, so I didn't answer him, you know? I'm processing, thinking about he asked me and, and I just don't have an answer yet. 

00:43:50
RICHARD STUART So when Della doesn't answer your questions, what does that imply to you? 

00:43:55
BRETT Um, then my question is basically meaningless. There's no meaning to them. She doesn't care. 

00:44:05
RICHARD STUART 'Kay, so you think that when she doesn't answer, she's made that non-answer as a statement about you. It's a negative statement about you. And as you her explanation uh, do you still feel that that's a valid conclusion? 

00:44:25
BRETT Um, I can listen to it and validate it, but I don't have to accept it. 

00:44:30
RICHARD STUART Well, no, you don't have to. How likely is it that she'll change? 

00:44:35
BRETT Zero. 

00:44:40
RICHARD STUART How likely is it that you could feel, if you relabeled it uh, in a way that made it acceptable, that it could become less of a problem for you? 

00:44:50
BRETT It could become less. 

00:44:55
RICHARD STUART Uh, this is a wonderful illustration of where acceptance would really be, probably more valuable than attempting to promote a change. What acceptance would do would be to show respect for her kind of attempt to get her thoughts in order in order to be able to be responsive to you. Uh, it would help you feel uh, less bad, less rejected, less invalidated by Della's doing something which is really a self-statement rather than a statement about you. Now, and that's where acceptance can play such a, such an invaluable role. 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:40
Please Pause Here & Practice 

00:45:45
JON CARLSON Now acceptance really is important. 

00:45:45
PAT LOVE Right, I'm starting to get the picture of co-creating a positive relationship and it seems like acceptance is a big piece of that. 

00:45:55
JON CARLSON It's almost right at the heart of it, that first step. 

00:45:55
PAT LOVE You, you know, it's sort of a relief to me that you don't have to try to change everything. I mean, and, and also to be thinking about, okay, what really is worthy of change and negotiation and what really is my responsibility to accept just as a normal living with another human being that's different than I. 

00:46:10
JON CARLSON And, and it's really so disrespectful too, isn't it, to expect other people to, you know, be the way we want them to be. 

00:46:20
PAT LOVE Right, I was taught that's rude. That's rude to expect someone else to, well, and when you think about it, it, it's, it's closed-minded or self-centered that I would expect you to do all the changing. Although, at some level, that does make sense. To expect you, 

00:46:35
RICHARD STUART But there are sometimes when acceptance, you can accept too much. 

00:46:40
PAT LOVE That's true. 

00:46:40
RICHARD STUART Uh, there, it really is a, a, it's a whole series of very delicate self-negotiations and negotiations with a partner, but you really have to decide, what's the price of my accepting this, uh, what's the price of my asking for change? And you do a very, very delicate uh, uh, qualitative analysis, if you will. Uh, you really try to weigh the pros and the cons of acceptance and asking for change, and make some intelligent decisions and try some things out. Once you go down uh, the route of requesting change, you can decide, well, you know, it's gonna be more work than I thought it, than it, than I thought it would be, it isn't worth it. You can start to accept something and decide, this, this just gets under my skin. I can't live with this nearly as well as I thought I could, I'm gonna have to bring this up. 

00:47:30
PAT LOVE The other thing I really liked, I found helpful, Dick, was the part where you got the other partner, for you to explain why you do this behavior because I get locked into my own thinking, and I make it up, I take-, I make it, I take it personally, I make up your, I can, I have had whole conversations in my head and gotten upset and never included the other person. 

00:47:50
RICHARD STUART I, I really want to take a second, I want to take a second to explain where that came from. Um, uh, I, I tend to argue, I tended to argue a whole lot. And Barbara and I were married for about six or seven months and we didn't have an argument. And I said to her one day, "What's going on here? I always fight with people. Why aren't you and I fighting?" She said, "Every time we start to have an argument, I try to understand your point of view." She said, "You're not crazy, what you do makes sense. Once I understand what you're thinking is, it's much easier for me to relate to you." It was she, it was my wife who taught me the importance of really understanding what the other person's true motives are, not taking everything personal, but looking at it from the other person's perspective. And that makes it much, much easier to offer acceptance and to offer it rationally and wisely. 

00:48:45
JON CARLSON The next activity that we're gonna move to though, is gonna be how you can actually bring about a change, and how you can build intimacy through small steps through using the Caring Days activity. 

00:49:00
RICHARD STUART Or, as Pat said, through acts of caring. 

00:49:00
Co-creating a Positive Relationship 

00:49:00
Exercise 2 Caring Days 

00:49:05
RICHARD STUART Uh, I, as a couples' therapist, I often get asked questions about, what's the difference between uh, a good marriage and a bad, a marriage that works and a marriage that doesn't? Some people say, "Well, isn't it true that uh, there are only serious conflicts in bad marriages. Uh, the reality is that there are serious conflicts in good marriages as well as bad marriages because uh, husbands and wives are different people. We have different concerns, we have different domains or worry. Uh, conflict is inevitable uh, in any partnership. The difference between a good marriage and a bad marriage is not the presence of issues, uh, it's how many good things happen uh, to create intimacy, to build a connection, to make those issues more manageable, to build a good faith that you need in order to be able to uh, find the energy to deal with the issues. So, in a loving relationship, I believe that couples express acts of caring dozens of times a day. Uh, it is extremely important uh, to put some thought, some time, and some energy into telling your partner that this person is really important to you, and you're willing to vote with your feet. You're willing to get up, get out of the chair, and do something. Uh, that's value, that's an indication of uh, the fact that uh, this person really matters to you tremendously. Unfortunately, very often, people do for the other things that they would really want done for them. And that's the problem of the Golden Rule. Golden Rule, remember, is, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Assume that everybody wants what you want. Well, we're all different. For example, when I was a kid, my parents would give me $3.00 and say, "Go buy a Christmas present." I walked down to Spritzer's toy store and I bought a present. Uh, Barb and Jackie, across the street, their parents would spend $3.00 for a present, wrap it up, hide it. Christmas lasted from Thanksgiving until Christmas Day when we ran through the house, shaking the boxes. Uh, I hate it when somebody says, "What do you want for a gift?" Uh, Barbara was given a Birthday party when she was 6. Her, invited seven girlfriends. First one brought a yellow umbrella. The birthday girl had to unwrap the present and say something nice about each present before cake and ice cream. Barbara said, "That's wonderful! I can get to school dry on rainy days." Next present was a blue umbrella. Barbara said, "That's wonderful! If I get a blue raincoat, I've got an umbrella to match it." There were two more yellow umbrellas in the pile and Barbara panicked because she couldn't imagine what she could say nice about them. Barbara hates to be given surprises because she hates to be put in a position in which she has to say she likes something that she may not like. Being honest is massively important to her. I love surprises. Our first Christmas, I spent six months Bar-, buying Barbara surprises, and each time she opened one, she got more and more agitated. I got the look. Uh, Barbara asked me what I wanted for Christmas two weeks ahead of time, and I was destroyed. I was so upset. "Doesn't she care enough about me to put some imagination into it?" Now, what I'm gonna do is ask each of you to identify some small caring behaviors that are very important to you. Uh, they have to be small, they have to be things that can happen every day or at least every week. Uh, they have to be uh, positive. I'm gonna ask you to count these behaviors once we get them listed. You can't count the non-occurrence of a negative. And they have to be things that you haven't had lots of, of fights about. They have to be conflict-free because I really wanna make sure that they're gonna be deliverable. 

00:53:25
Caring Days Requests 

00:53:25
Is it positive? Is it specific? Can it happen now? Is it conflict-free? 

00:53:25
"Caring Days" List/Inventory 

00:53:25
Divide paper into 3 columns. List "Caring Behaviors" down the center columns. Put each of your names on the top of the left and right columns. 

00:53:25
RICHARD STUART Now what I'm gonna ask each of you to do is use the Caring Days sheet and down the middle of that sheet, one sheet per couple, I'm gonna ask you to each list behaviors that matter to you, the things that you would like to have happen that are signs that the other person cares. And then I'm gonna ask you to uh, put them into practice and we'll talk about uh, the rules for making that work as soon as we've got the lists complete. 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:00
Please Pause Here & Write 

00:54:05
RICHARD STUART Okay, so now what I'd like to do is start getting an idea of some of the caring behaviors that each of you uh, would value in the other, and I'd like to begin with Frank and Beverly, and uh, what are some of the things that uh, Frank, Beverly could do that you would really like? Either they're things that she has been doing right along and you'd like her to continue, or maybe there're some things that you'd like that she hasn't done before. 

00:54:40
FRANK Well, um, I think probably one of the things that I do like is um, like late at night, I like to be alone. I like from 11:00 to midnight or something, I like to be by myself and, and generally she does leave me alone, so I like that. 

00:55:00
RICHARD STUART Okay. Beverly. What are some things that you'd like? What would be some signs of caring for you? 

00:55:05
BEVERLY Well, the fact that he would tell me that he um, would like that time alone. 

00:55:10
RICHARD STUART Tell me what you'd like. 

00:55:10
BEVERLY Tell what you like, rather than just having me just try to read his mind, I think. 

00:55:15
RICHARD STUART 'Kay, wonderful. So our third caring behavior on your list, then, would be um, uh, make requests. What else? 

00:55:25
BEVERLY Let's see, what else? Things I'd like him to do? 

00:55:25
RICHARD STUART Or things that he does that you'd like him to keep doing. 

00:55:30
BEVERLY Oh, um, he just gives me a kiss or something, or a hug and very unexpected, you know. I just think that's really neat. You know, for no reason at all. 

00:55:40
RICHARD STUART Giving a surprise, giving, so giving a surprise kiss or a surprise hug. 

00:55:45
RICHARD STUART Has anybody got any different kinds of, of caring behaviors that we could add to the list? Della? 

00:55:50
DELLA Um, one thing that Brett does that's really nice is every morning he pours me a glass of juice. And it's always somewhere, and there have been mornings where, you know, I've poured myself a glass of juice and he's like, "What're you doing? It's over there!" But I mean, it really is very nice. And it's, to me that would be a caring behavior. 

00:56:10
RICHARD STUART So, you like to find it in the sock drawer or, 

00:56:15
DELLA No, I mean. We have such little time in the mornings, I don't look around for it, so, and sometimes it's on the counter, sometimes it's on the table, but the fact that he does it is a caring behavior. 

00:56:25
RICHARD STUART That's a wonderful gesture. What else? 

00:56:25
ARLISS I have two, two that my husband does. One is he makes coffee every morning and he gets offended if I make the coffee. That's his treat for me every morning. But the second thing is that when I come home from work, I like sort of a welcoming reception. We have a dog and the dog um, will welcome me at the front door, and I'm all excited and I come in and he's sitting there, well, he gets home before I do, so he's sitting there watching TV. And one day I just sorta stood in front of the television, I said, "You know, it seems like the dog is the only one that really notices when I come in the door." So the next morning, the next evening when I came home, uh, he rolled off the sofa, sort of gave me this "woof", and he was sort of, "I'm a dog. Is this what you want?" So ever since then, when I come home from, from work, he, his eyes brighten up, the TV is uh, no longer a distraction, and he gives me all of his attention. 

00:57:25
RICHARD STUART And on that day, did the dog walk up on its hind legs? 

00:57:25
ARLISS Well the dog didn't know what was going on! 

00:57:25
RICHARD STUART Say, "Hi, honey, I'm glad you're home." 

00:57:30
ARLISS The dog didn't know what was going on. 

00:57:30
RICHARD STUART Okay, that's a wonderful one. Other, other, other sort of, please. 

00:57:40
MARY KAY You uh, one thing that means a lot to me, John is very busy at work, but every now and then, he'll take time to, you know, give me a phone call, either at my office or at home, depending on where I'm at, and it's just, it's just nice, it makes me feel so good inside to think that, you know, even if he, sometimes he'll say, "You know what, I can only talk for a minute, I gotta go," but he took the time, and that's what means a lot to me. 

00:58:00
RICHARD STUART That's wonderful. Now sometimes, caring behaviors can also be things that you value that are done for others. Uh, any time Barbara has uh, interaction with my kids, I really feel valued by her. Any time I have a conversation with her parents, Barbara feels valued by me. So caring behaviors don't have to only be focused on you. 

00:58:25
DELLA Uh, just recently, like, I don't know, the past year, Brett has started buying his own family their birthday cards and doing their thank you cards. And just last week was uh, his second cousin's and he went out and bought a card and he gave her the card. We saw her at an occasion. And then the night of her birthday, she called our home and I couldn't speak with her, I was busy, and Brett spoke with her. When I came down, I said, "Why did she call?" He says, "Well, she wanted to thank us for the flowers I gave her." So he went and did that all on his own, and it, it made me feel so good because he went and did it on his own and it was less that I had to do. And he remembered on his own and bought his own thing and it was for his family and it was really nice. 

00:59:15
RICHARD STUART I wonder if maybe we could delete this from the tape. I'm not sure I want my wife to know that men can buy cards and send them too. 

00:59:25
DELLA Sorry! 

00:59:25
RICHARD STUART That is wonderful. 

00:59:25
Guidelines for Caring Days 

00:59:25
Read list every a.m. Commit to 5 or more/day Enter date your partner offered a caring gesture Review list each p.m. Add new items Clarify, don't conflict 

00:59:25
RICHARD STUART Now these are wonderful items, uh, wonderful, caring gestures. Here's what I'd like you to do with them. Please read the list over every single morning to remind yourself of uh, what sorts of things are really valued by your partner. Commit yourself, plan ahead of time to at least five of them every day. Uh, and if you do 25, so much the better. But kind of build, make a little mental note, a little sticky note in your brains saying, "This is something that I'm gonna do today." Each evening, look over the list again and put in the date under the column that said John did it or the column that said Mary Kay did it. Each name should be on the top of one of the columns. That way, you acknowledge uh, uh, what you had received. It's a very nice way of communicating appreciation for what you get. It's also a way of uh, looking at the list and deciding whether you've done enough to uh, kind of uh, invest the positive energy in the relationship that you want. You're gonna review the list every evening and add to it. Uh, there are many, many items we haven't covered yet that each of you value. Every time you're aware of the fact that you appreciate something that your partner did, or every time that you think of something else you'd like to have happen, enter it to the list, on the list if it's positive, specific, and can happen in the next few days, and make sure that any time that uh, there's an issue that uh, arises over something on the Caring Days list, that you discuss it in a problem-solving way. Caring Days lists should never be a source of conflict. You don't have to do everything on the list. Uh, treat the Caring Days list as a set of opportunities to invest in the relationship, not a bill of particulars that have to be delivered. 

01:01:25
JON CARLSON Dick, Caring Days is perhaps been a savior in my marriage. You know, we've been married for 31 years and when we came upon Caring Days, we realized those small, molecular behaviors, whether it's a hug or greeting someone at the door, or not greeting someone at the door, what a, what a difference it's made in our life. 

01:01:45
RICHARD STUART The beauty of Caring Days is that it puts you in control of how good you feel about your partner. If you want to feel wonderful about your marriage, you can do more, get more, and you're sure to feel better. 

01:02:00
JON CARLSON I'm a real competitive guy, though. And so I, I think I would get to, really into this, like "I did it seven times, you only did it five times." The scoring system seems pretty dangerous for us. 

01:02:10
RICHARD STUART Yeah, you can make it a competition. On the other hand, that's not a bad competition because what you can say is, "You know, I'd really like it if you did even more of these." Um, uh, you don't use it to punish each other, you use it as a way of structuring re-, requests for, for more engagement. 

01:02:30
PAT LOVE Okay. I was noticing, just one thing. I was noticing just watching the couples and listening to the energy. The energy was just like light-hearted and people were smiling and, and, and the voices were higher and people were moving more and the gazes at one another and the loving looks. It was just so uplifting just to watch that, and I got a contact high at watching all that. 

01:02:55
JON CARLSON It was contagious, wasn't it? Yeah. 

01:02:55
PAT LOVE Yes, it was contagious. 

01:02:55
JON CARLSON What uh, observations or learning did you have as you went through the Caring Days activity? 

01:03:00
JULIUS One of the things that I'm, I'm finding interesting, I, I kinda shoot myself in the foot. Um, I look at chores and things that, that I do as labor-intensive. I cut the grass or I crawl up on the roof and clean the gutters, and you can do the dishes. Well, often times, she doesn't wanna do the dishes. And often times even though I did mow the grass, uh, it would be a kind gesture on my part, and, and it's coming to me that, that it would be a, a gift to her if I would draw in and do the dishes or vacuum or something of that nature just to demonstrate poignantly like that, this is a gift to you from me. And, I mean, it's just coming like a neon sign in my head. This is what you should do. 

01:03:45
RICHARD STUART I, I would reinforce that with a, with another concept. I think of every caring behavior as money in the bank. What you're doing is investing, building a good faith balance uh, in your passbook. Uh, and the more things you do, the more you can grow against in the future. 

01:04:05
FRANK It sounds like that everything we're doing is almost like, done in the privacy with the two people. I mean, um, but in the real world where you, there's other people and their opinions and everything like that, um, to say to Julius, would, would you be doing the dishes if your buddies came over? 

01:04:25
RICHARD STUART Ha. But you know, that's, that would be just, that would be perfect because if Arliss felt it was very important for Julius to define their relationship as one in which he's flexible, it could be 18 times more important for her to do it when his buddies are over than um, uh, than when uh, they're just alone. 

01:04:50
JON CARLSON It works, huh? 

01:04:50
RICHARD STUART Ah, and, you know, so, often times the con-, the social context in which these things take place is uh, massively important. And you get lots of bonus points for doing things that uh, will help your partner feel better because of the social context. 

01:05:10
JON CARLSON Well, we've really come a long way so far with validation and then moving into caring, and it seems like marriage is just a constant negotiation. You negotiate one thing after another after another. 

01:05:25
RICHARD STUART Marriage is a never-ending negotiation, and what we should really do now is spend some time talking about how to handle those negotiations most skillfully. 

01:05:30
Co-Creating a Positive Relationship 

01:05:30
Exercise 3 Negotiation/Decision Making 

01:05:35
JON CARLSON Why don't we do that? We'll move to talking about, I was gonna say "two-whiner" negotiations, but that was before the two-winner negotiations. 

01:05:40
RICHARD STUART Perfect. 

01:05:45
JON CARLSON Good. 

01:05:50
RICHARD STUART I think of all relationships as never-ending negotiations. And you can negotiate in a way that allows you to get to successful conclusions or that uh, really uh, can cause problems. So I wanna try to help all of you get the, all the skills you need to make those negotiations turn out to your mutual advantage. 

01:06:10
Useful Negotiation Principles 

01:06:10
"Platinum Rule" Equity vs Equality Responsibility must equal authority Suspicious vs trusting agreements 50/50 vs 90/90 

01:06:15
RICHARD STUART There're several principles we're gonna use that we've already talked to. We're, we've discussed the Platinum Rule. Uh, remember that whenever you negotiate that it's important to understand what your partner wants, not assume that you know. So that's gonna be a critical one. We've also talked about the importance of equity as apposed to equality. Doesn't matter how many uh, this or that each person does. What matters is, does it seem fair? Now fair is a little subjective. Equity is subjective. And often times, you have to talk about it in order to be able to work it through. Uh, another aspect of negotiation that's important is people shouldn't have more authority than they are willing to accept responsibility for. I can't, for example, have the authority to decide that my wife should cook nine-course meals every day. She works, I work. Uh, if I want nine-course meals, I can say we're gonna have nine-course meals as long as I'm ready to cook 'em. So it's important to make sure that you don't try to exercise more authority than you're willing to accept responsibility for. And we'll uh, get to that in a minute. It's also important to operate on the assumption of good faith agreements. Uh, most couples kind of, in their heart of hearts, know that the other is with them because they wanna be, but then they don't really trust it. Act as if your partner is uh, as interested in your being happy as your partner is, wants to pursue his own or her own happiness. That both of you recognize that relationships can't work unless they work for both of you. You can't have a one-winner outcome in any negotiation with a couple, within a couple because if you win something, you've gotta pay back what you won plus punitive damages. In a good-faith re-, in a good-faith negotiation, in a trusting negotiation, you operate with the assumption that your partner is as interested in your being happy as you are. And finally, we have to talk about the kinds of, the kinds of agreements that couples can make. Now I have a question for you. Uh, uh, one of you wants to go to the beach for vacation and one of you wants to go to the mountains. 'Kay? Where do you go? How do you handle that? 

01:08:50
DELLA You go somewhere where there's mountains and beach. 

01:08:55
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

01:08:55
DELLA Lake Tahoe. 

01:08:55
RICHARD STUART One possibility. 

01:08:55
DELLA Don't they have mountains and beach there? 

01:08:55
RICHARD STUART One possibility is if you can find a way where there's mountains and beach, uh, that would work very well. Um, that's one possibility. What's another? 

01:09:10
ARLISS I might ask the question, how important is it to you? 

01:09:10
RICHARD STUART Really important to both. 

01:09:15
BRETT Each go to your own place. 

01:09:15
RICHARD STUART Okay, another possibility. You can decide to split. What's another possibility? 

01:09:20
FRANK You don't go to the mountains or the beach. 

01:09:20
RICHARD STUART Okay, you go to a place that is somewhat satisfying to both of you. Or, 

01:09:30
ARLISS This year we go here, next year we go there. 

01:09:35
RICHARD STUART Perfect. Now we've just talked about all the possibilities for an outcome. Lot of people think negotiation means that if, you have to have a 50/50 conclusion which means that everybody gets half of what they want. That isn't necessarily true. In a well-structured negotiation, sometimes you end up with 50/50 and sometimes you end up with 90/90. What that means is, there are some times when each person uh, get to basically do what he or she wants with the good-faith assumption that the other's gonna reciprocate. So, it's equitable, whether it's 50/50 or 90/90, but I really love to ask couples to find as many 90/90 solutions as possible cuz uh, whenever you can, it's very nice to get more than half of what's satisfying. Uh, Julius, you mentioned uh, you and Arliss were a little concerned about how to make decisions about weekend time. 

01:10:30
JULIUS Right. Um, often times I like to the beach, ride a bike, uh, do something that's, that's leisurely, something that, that's uh, it's value added to me that I get my rest and my recreation. And my wife is just the opposite. She has chores behind chores behind chores, and so in order to fulfill her obligation and mine as well, uh, we have to kinda come to some kind of agreement, and often times we get uh, kinda uh, uh, what, what can I say? Caught up in the uh, decision-making process, so to speak. 

01:11:10
RICHARD STUART Okay. So Arliss' idea of a, of a way to relax on the weekend is to have you do some chore and um, and your idea is for you to be on your bike and go off, tooting around, having a good time. 

01:11:20
JULIUS Right. 

01:11:20
RICHARD STUART With Arliss? 

01:11:20
JULIUS Yes. 

01:11:25
RICHARD STUART You want to do it together. Okay. So the question is not how much time do we spend together or apart, it's how do we use the time when we're together. Do you agree? Is that the issue as you see it? 

01:11:35
ARLISS Right, but I feel that doing the chores together is nice too. 

01:11:35
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

01:11:40
ARLISS That's bonding time, right? 

01:11:40
RICHARD STUART So, how can you resolve, how often do you argue about it? Do you argue about it, or is it a strain? 

01:11:45
JULIUS It's, it's, there's tension in the air. I wouldn't say that we're, we're argumentative, but there is some stress. And uh, normally what I would, I think in my mind, I try to rationalize it, "Well I do 50% of what she wants, then the rest of the time is mine." I'll block out things that I'm gonna do absolutely and after that, I won't budge. 

01:12:10
RICHARD STUART Okay. And on your times when you feel that you've done as much as you should, but Arliss still has a, a better idea. 

01:12:15
JULIUS Absolutely. 

01:12:15
RICHARD STUART Okay. Uh, and you do see him doing some things some of the time, but not necessarily as many as you would like him to do? 

01:12:25
ARLISS Right. 

01:12:25
RICHARD STUART I really believe that rules create freedom, uh, that once you have a clear idea of what the expectations are, then you're free to uh, to do that and know when you can relax, and you're also free to decide, well, not, I, I'd rather deal with a testy wife than uh, do this last chore. But uh, I really believe that rules create freedom, and the way you get the rules is you negotiate them. So let's do a little bit of that now. Um, how, how would you like to allocate weekend time between getting the chores done and um, having pleasant relaxation time. How, how would you, how would you slice up the time pie? 

01:13:10
JULIUS Be honest. 

01:13:10
ARLISS Okay. Um, I think Saturdays should be a day that we get all of our chores out of the way, and probably if we had my way, I probably could do it also on some Friday nights. Um, I do like for my Sundays, though, to be kind of, 'kay, if I wanna go to church, and I wanna come home, I don't really wanna have a whole lot to do. So I'm the kind of person, I'd rather get things done up front. If I know I have a lot to do and I feel that I can't fit it all into Saturday, I'll want it to spill over into Friday, versus Sunday. My husband, on the other hand, um, Friday's after, 

01:13:40
RICHARD STUART Uh, let, let, let, let him speak for himself. 

01:13:45
JULIUS Okay. My idea, it would be Friday evening, we'd go to a show or we'll go out and um, have a beer um, just go out and, whatever, and uh, just uh, forget about the world and be with ourselves. And uh, Saturday morning, we'd get up and hit it, what we have to do. Um, then that evening we can go and continue our pleasant time. And Sunday we go to church and enjoy some more pleasant time. 

01:14:15
RICHARD STUART Okay. So, the di-, the disagreement that you have is you both agree that Saturday is okay, but you think that it's, that Friday nights should be added to it and a little bit of Sunday afternoon, if you need it. 

01:14:30
ARLISS Right. 

01:14:30
RICHARD STUART You want some spillover time. You clearly like to have um, more time protected. How're you gonna resolve it? Pe-, both are perfectly reasonable. 

01:14:40
JULIUS Well, there's several ways. I can just go ahead and be obedient, but uh, then I smolder resentment. 

01:14:45
RICHARD STUART That boat don't float. 

01:14:50
JULIUS So I become passive-aggressive, but um, we sat down and we talk about it and um, I think she overloads her plate and she doesn't think I put a lot on my plate, so we negotiate. And we say, well, okay, at a certain hour we should have such and such done. And then we can go ahead and do whatever we wanna do after that. And normally, usually that works. Sometimes it doesn't because uh, there's other external pressures that she has to meet, deadlines that she has to meet, and so that kinda interferes with uh, our, our objectives. But for the most part, we negotiate. The long and short of it is that we do negotiate times to do both. 

01:15:30
RICHARD STUART The difficulty with that is that it means that every weekend, neither one of you can relax, being confident that things are gonna go the way you want it to go uh, because uh, the negotiation is always a little bit uncertain. Let's see if we can come up with some guidelines. Uh, my wife likes the word "guidelines" more than "rules." I tend to think of rules, but that's gender-related. Um, uh, let's think of some guidelines that you could use that would make it easier. One common solution to problems about time is that it's often much more helpful to broaden the scope and not talk about each weekend as an individual uh, event, but think about how many hours in the course of a month it's important for you to spend getting chores done, and then how many hours you can spend um, uh, doing recreation things, and that way you get a certain pile of chips. Uh, you get chore time, uh, certain number of hours of chore time, and if you want to use more of them one week than the next, then you can talk about it, but then you have to be prepared to uh, kick back and have more fun the next week because you've used some of those chips. In, in, in the course of a month, how much chore time do you want from Julius? 

01:16:50
ARLISS In hours? 

01:16:50
RICHARD STUART Yes. 

01:16:55
ARLISS In a week, maybe 10. 

01:16:55
RICHARD STUART 10 per week? So 40 in a month. How does 10 sound to you? 

01:17:05
JULIUS I love it. 10 hours? No problem. 

01:17:10
RICHARD STUART Okay, now that means that sometimes, that'll all be done on Saturday, but sometimes Arliss will say, "Okay, Julius, I wanna spend three of my hours on Friday night um, uh, and I really wanna be able to uh, uh, get certain things done on Saturday." Uh, or she could say, "I wanna spend 18 of my hours this weekend because there are some things that are really important, but then next weekend we could take all Saturday and Sunday off." So that would work? 

01:17:40
ARLISS It sounds like it would work. 

01:17:40
RICHARD STUART Okay. That, that's a prototype of a two-winner outcome because Arliss gets to count on as, uh, the time she feels she needs from Julius, and Julius gets reassurance that Arliss is gonna join him in relaxation and neither one is gonna feel cheated by the other or have to worry about whether uh, they're gonna get their due. Are there anyb-, are there any others who, who have similar sorts of, of, face similar sorts of challenges. 

01:18:05
BRETT I'm sure we could talk about romance for probably three or four weeks if you'd like to. 

01:18:10
RICHARD STUART Okay, let's talk about romance. And three or four weeks will hardly do it justice. 

01:18:15
BRETT Probably, you're probably right. 

01:18:20
RICHARD STUART What, what would you like in the romance? 

01:18:20
DELLA What was your issue? 

01:18:20
BRETT What was my issue? 

01:18:25
DELLA Yeah, I wasn't expecting this. 

01:18:25
BRETT Well, to be honest with you, since uh, we're all being open and honest, I, 

01:18:30
DELLA We're on camera, Brett. We're on camera. 

01:18:35
RICHARD STUART You wanna be left alone some nights, you wanna just be able to turn over and go to sleep, right? 

01:18:40
[sil.] 

01:18:45
BRETT I wanna be more sexually active with my wife and my wife wants more romance. 

01:18:50
RICHARD STUART What do you mean by romance? 

01:18:55
DELLA What do I mean? 

01:18:55
RICHARD STUART Yeah. 

01:19:00
DELLA Um, I don't um, uh, how you, I don't know. I'm stumped. 

01:19:05
BRETT You're not stumped. Take a deep breath and you'll talk for hours. 

01:19:10
DELLA I could talk for hours. 

01:19:15
RICHARD STUART This, this is embarrassing and you're handling it wonderfully. 

01:19:15
DELLA What do I mean, what do I, define romance as? Um, I don't know, just nice, talk, talking that. Alright. Discussion or communication between the two of us that shows me how I'm valued by him or even in some kind of actions that, that does that as well. It's all sort of symbolic sort of, you know, I mean, if he walks in and says, "I'm gonna be romantic tonight. Here, honey, here's some flowers." Now it takes the romance away. And it needs to be kind of spontaneous. It's like that, you know, when you take out the vacuum cleaner and your wife knows. Well, when he does something that I know then it kind of takes away from, you know, the romance. It needs to be genuine and sincere, you know, and he has a tendency to just kinda roll over and say. I can't believe you're bringing this up. 

01:20:20
RICHARD STUART Yeah, this is an, 

01:20:20
DELLA He just kind of rolls over and says, 

01:20:25
RICHARD STUART It's time, honey? 

01:20:25
DELLA And I'm snuggled up on my side and I'm like, "No." Well, and then we have a problem. But, I mean, there's other times too, he's just. I don't think romance is just kind of gone when you talk about that second date, you know, there's a kind of romance, the kind of things that you do on a second date that, you know, that goes away unless you practice that. And I call that romance. That's, that's what I call it. 

01:20:50
RICHARD STUART Would you like to make love with him more often than you're now, 

01:20:50
DELLA Oh, yeah. 

01:20:50
RICHARD STUART Okay, so you both have the same goal and the question is, how're you gonna get there? 

01:20:55
BRETT Right. 

01:21:00
RICHARD STUART And what you're doing is basically giving him the keys to the kingdom uh, what you're saying is, he can have more uh, sexual intimacy with you if he'll establish more emotional intimacy with you. 

01:21:10
DELLA Very well put. It's so much better than what I could have done. 

01:21:15
RICHARD STUART Now, do you know what she, do you know what she means by that? 

01:21:20
BRETT I, no, I don't wanna assume. 

01:21:20
RICHARD STUART How, how would you find, great, how would you find out? 

01:21:25
BRETT How would I find out? Um, well, I know if I do ask her, she wouldn't wanna tell me because then that would take some of it away. Spontaneity. 

01:21:35
RICHARD STUART 'Kay. 

01:21:35
BRETT To me, romance is lighting the candles, filling up the tub, getting out the wine, it's, it's the two- or three-hour process, and she keeps telling me it's not a two- or three-hour process, but in my mind the romance is a two-, three-hour process, and we don't have two, three hours. 

01:21:55
RICHARD STUART I think she's telling you that it doesn't have to be Cecil B. DeMille's acts, that you don't need a cast of thousands. Um, uh, what can he do? Uh, uh, he raises a very interesting problem. If he asks you the question and you answer it and then he does those things and you then accuse him of being planful and manipulative, then all burned. What can he do without your feeling that it's all too goal-directed? What would you like him to do? What's your, what's your, your vision of an ideal encounter with your husband? 

01:22:35
DELLA My ideal encounter with my husband. Um. So could, you know, I don't know, maybe. I don't know if this is gonna work or not, but I, I mean, if I come downstairs and I'm putting the kids to bed, and he turns off the TV, and said, "Come over here, I wanna hold you," or even sometimes if the TV is on, I'll ask him, "Will you hold me if I come over there," you know, and then maybe, I don't know, just some nice conversation about things that he appreciates about me and. 

01:23:10
RICHARD STUART So foreplay for you begins long before you get in the sheets. 

01:23:10
DELLA Yeah. 

01:23:10
RICHARD STUART Uh, and uh, it can begin on the family room sofa with a conversation uh, with the TV turned off. What else? 

01:23:20
DELLA What else? Another scenario? 

01:23:25
RICHARD STUART Yes. 

01:23:25
DELLA Um, well that, I, I like surprises, I love surprises. So any kind of surprise, unexpected little um, action, maybe picking me up from work and taking me out to dinner and already have taken care of the babysitter, so I don't have to worry or think about that kind of thing. And so then we have time together at dinner and, and then we can, I don't know, come home. But, but, just that action and, you know, when we get to dinner, let's not talk about, you know, bills we have to pay or what are we going to sell the house, and when are we gonna build the next one. Maybe at that dinner, "I'm taking you out because I wanna be with you, and I wanna show you how much I love you, and I'm taking you here because it's this way and it reminds me of this." I don't know. Sounds good. 

01:24:15
RICHARD STUART What have you heard? What have you heard? What, what cue, what, what tips has she given here? 

01:24:20
BRETT I know I'm gonna pick her up every day from work for a week. Um, uh, she doesn't want the everyday uh, the everyday normal activities being spoking, spoken between us when we're, when I'm going to try to be intimate with her. Um, what else did I hear? Um, she likes surprises. Um, if I can be intimate with her before we get in the sheets, that's to my advantage. That's about all I got. 

01:24:55
RICHARD STUART Uh, you just, you just made a slight slip that puts you in a victim role, and uh, here a situation where you're really not, your victimization isn't relevant. It's not to your advantage, it's to our advantage because remember, in a good-faith negotiation, you assume that your satisfaction is her's and um, Della is as interested in having more, a more intimate connection with you as you are in having a more intimate connection with her. What she's saying is, "I can get there a lot more easily if I feel that, more valued by you as a person, uh, not just as a sex object, but as somebody who you really appreciate and are willing to extend yourself for." She knows you love her. Um, she's asking for some more symbolic expressions of it, and that would, am I speaking correctly for you? And that, it would help her feel more sensual. Uh, and more receptive. Who initiates your lovemaking? Is it always you, Brett? 

01:26:05
BRETT Yes, sir. I won't say always. I'll say 99. 

01:26:10
RICHARD STUART Uh, 

01:26:10
BRETT It's been always for a long time, though. 

01:26:15
DELLA Since the children. 

01:26:15
BRETT Since the children, that's been always for me. 

01:26:15
RICHARD STUART What inhibits you from initiating? You'd like it if she, if Della initiated, right? 

01:26:20
BRETT I would not have a problem. 

01:26:25
DELLA I'm sure you wouldn't. Um, I, you know what, I just, I think I just got out of that initiating or aggressing um, because when I got pregnant, both times I needed to, we needed to not be sexually active for medical reasons. And so, you know, once you pull yourself away and get yourself out of practice, it's, it's hard to come back and even when we started thinking about coming back, working on coming back, it was like, why are we doing this cuz we're gonna have another one, they're gonna say the same thing, and so, you know, you just go back in and. 

01:27:00
BRETT Well, we're done now, so you can come back. 

01:27:00
DELLA But I think, I think now, I mean that's part of it, I don't think that's the majority of it. The majority of it, I really think is resentment that I have towards him. That I don't wanna give him what he wants because I don't get what I want. 

01:27:15
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

01:27:15
DELLA And I think it's mostly resentment, is what keeps us, aside from just being out of the practice of, I think that, you know, is there too, but not as a major force. 

01:27:25
RICHARD STUART If, if, he picked you up at work once in a while and turned off the TV and said, "Come sit down and, and let me hold you for a while," and he didn't initiate sex, you think you could initiate it a couple times a week? 

01:27:40
DELLA A couple times a week? That would be challenging. 

01:27:45
BRETT It would be great. 

01:27:45
DELLA It would be challenging. 

01:27:50
RICHARD STUART Could you do it once a week? 

01:27:55
DELLA I guess if I felt um, it, it would depend on how I feel, I guess. If I felt, not deserves it, but that I satisfied enough that I'm open to giving myself to him in that way cuz um, really getting. 

01:28:15
RICHARD STUART Uh, if you agree that you would take responsibility for initiating that, that Brett wouldn't initiate, that he would count on you to do it and you would do it when it felt right for you, but if in the course of a week, it didn't feel right for you, you could say to him, "You know, honey, I feel kinda distant from you." I mean, don't take this personally, Brett. Um, uh, but, "Honey, I don't feel so close to you. I, I'd like to spend a little more time with you. Can we spend an hour talking together? Let's reconnect a little." Uh, so then you have the opportunity to uh, make love when you feel uh, inclined to do it, not enough to say no when you don't, but you also have the responsibility to uh, do what you can to create the closeness, to build the bridges that will help you feel more comfortable about it. Um, you clearly love each other. You clearly have a respectful relationship with each other. You both would much rather have more contact rather than less. Um, you have uh, the average expected difference in uh, in interest and in style about sexuality, and it's one of those areas where negotiation can uh, have magical effects. Uh, it's a two-winner outcome if you will initiate more and uh, uh, you will do more that you know Della would really uh, 

01:29:55
BRETT Respond? 

01:29:55
RICHARD STUART Warm her soul. 

01:29:55
BRETT Right. 

01:29:55
RICHARD STUART Um, uh, and then you can increase the frequency of your lovemaking and both feel better about it. Um, I really like uh, your uh, the cues you've given him are wonderful. They're so deliverable by Brett. He can really do those things. Uh, you have to keep up the chatter and make sure that, that, that the list gets longer. I mean, I mentioned I can, I can uh, vacuum. I can offer to do, do garden tours with Barbara and look at what she's grown. I can offer to, to do some weeding or carry compost up the hill. Uh, all of those are ways of my saying to Barbara, "What's important to you is important to me." It makes her feel much closer and much more inclined to be friendly. So that, that's a great one. Uh, thank you, and you handled your embar-, embarrassment just beautifully. 

01:31:00
DELLA Can I go and take a shower? 

01:31:05
RICHARD STUART With him. 

01:31:05
JON CARLSON I really like this process that you just went through. It seemed like the couples really benefited from it. But I'm not sure if I understand the steps to follow. Can you help me with that, Dick? 

01:31:15
Steps to Negotiation 

01:31:15
1. Figure out exactly what your partner would like. 2. Understand something from your partner's perspective. 3. Trade your desires with your partner's desires. 4. Add or group your desires. 

01:31:20
RICHARD STUART Sure. Um, first, each person has to figure out exactly what they would like. 

01:31:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:31:25
RICHARD STUART Then they have to understand uh, something from their partner's perspective. You gotta ask some questions. You gotta say, "This is what I would like. Can you tell me why it's hard for you, what stands in the way of your giving it to me?" Then you have to figure out how you can trade uh, uh, your getting what you want and what your partner would like, and often times uh, it means going beyond the immediate issue. Uh, in uh, Brett and Della's illustration, Brett would like to make love more often. Well, if we just said to Della, okay, so give in. That would be very one-sided cons-, concession and it wouldn't work. So I made the issue, I made um, the agenda longer. Della would like uh, some um, uh, attention from Brett on the, on the family room sofa in the evening. She would like him to surprise her in some ways. And so uh, there was an opportunity for each person to say yes and get something, and that's the essence of the two-winner outcome. 

01:32:25
JON CARLSON So, so if you're stuck, you need to broaden the problem? 

01:32:25
RICHARD STUART What else can we throw, what else can we put on the table that will make it easier for you to say yes? Think about it this way: you're gonna buy a house, and the owner says that the price of the house is $100,000, and you say, "Well, you know, that's really kind of a lot, I'm gonna have to buy a new riding lawnmower." Owner says, "Okay, well, tell you what. Suppose I sell you my $5,000 lawnmower for $2,500." And say, "Okay, well that means the house, then, really's only cost me $97,500. I can buy that house." Um, so you're enlarging the range of options so that you can find a way so that you both can feel whole at the end of the, a negotiation. If you don't do that, somebody's gonna feel resentful. 

01:33:10
JON CARLSON So, so it's what, what you would like to happen, why your partner has a problem with providing it, and, 

01:33:20
RICHARD STUART What else, what would make it easier for them to give it? And that's the good-faith assumption. Assume that your partner wants to do it, but wants something, but, but has to have some other things thrown in. 

01:33:30
JON CARLSON And then, what are you willing to trade or to give to get what you want? 

01:33:35
RICHARD STUART Right. How can the two of you fashion some guidelines that'll work for both of you? 

01:33:40
JON CARLSON Wow. I can't wait to try this. 

01:33:40
PAT LOVE I realize, too, in watching the process that, as a person who thinks out loud, sometimes I need to talk just to know what I want or what I can tell my partner that I need. So that was a part I was, I was sitting there thinking, "You know, I don't," I often know what I don't want, but I have to talk to figure out what I do want. So that would have to be part of the process for me, maybe just. Sometimes I think just talking doesn't feel like you're making progress, but for the extrovert, it is making progress. 

01:34:15
RICHARD STUART Don't do these negotiations holding a stopwatch. The more you can discuss it, the more you can understand each other, the better the agreement is likely to be. 

01:34:25
JON CARLSON Well, we've covered an awful lot of interesting topics, and I'm really looking forward to this next one because this final skill-building activity I think will resolve a lot of the issues we've already talked about because we seem to be spending so much time in the past. And in this next segment, you're gonna take us into the future as we begin to plan future possibilities. 

01:34:50
RICHARD STUART And it's the other piece in the puzzle and the answer to Julius' question because one way you establish good faith in a relationship is to establish faith in the future. 

01:35:00
JON CARLSON Oh, I see. So then you have a shared future, this compelling future that pulls you and your partner. 

01:35:05
PAT LOVE So are we going back to the future? 

01:35:05
JON CARLSON Oh, my. 

01:35:05
Co-creating a Positive Relationship 

01:35:05
Exercise 4 Future Fantasy 

01:35:10
RICHARD STUART We are going to take giant steps into the future now. 

01:35:15
[sil.] 

01:35:20
RICHARD STUART Uh, it really is a way of, of, of building on the notion of good faith. A lot of the things that we're talking about are exchanges that take place in the moment. Uh, uh, all of you have very complicated lives. You have, uh, you spend a lot more time uh, doing things that have to be done uh, than you do enjoying each other and enjoying life. I hate to think in terms of all satisfactions being deferred, but a lot of satisfactions are. Uh, it's very important for couples to be uh, uh, to create some fantasies together that allow them to have a sense of their moving towards a shared goal. What are we working for? Why are we doing all this? What, what do we wanna have? What are the rewards? Uh, where is it all gonna lead us? What's our conception of the kind of life that we wanna have? Uh, what's gonna give meaning to our life over time? Uh, often times, people operate on, in very different worlds because they don't discuss those things and they don't negotiate a picture of the future. That picture makes the future much more likely to happen. When Barbara and I lived in Utah and we were gonna move, we uh, spent um, uh, hours every week walking around, talking about the kind of house we would have and where it would be and what it would be like and what our lives would be like, and we're living in that house now, in the place that we had fantasized. Uh, we walk into this house and instantly both said, "That's it. We found it." It was only possible because we had talked about it. We had co-created uh, this ideal model for what we wanted to have the future be. Now, we don't want exactly the same things. I would like to live rurally, Barbara would like to live in the city. Uh, Barbara kind of get in the way of my fantasy a little bit. She thinks a 48-mile roundtrip drive to the nearest supermarket to buy a lemon, it's too long. I think it's just about right. I get in the way of her fantasy. Uh, she's not a short walk to the library. So we have to talk about these things and find ways, again, using the two-winner negotiation principle, so that we can come up with fantasy that works for both of us. And uh, it takes years to do that. It takes, it's a, it's a very long-term, quite wonderful conversation. Cy? 

01:37:45
CY Well, Kim and I, when we move down to Florida. 

01:37:45
RICHARD STUART You both want to move to Florida? 

01:37:45
CY Yes, we do. 

01:37:45
RICHARD STUART Okay. And what's your idea? Where would you live? What would it be like? 

01:37:50
CY Like living on the Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater area. Uh, preferably on the water. Um, I would be semi-retired. 

01:38:00
RICHARD STUART What does "semi" mean? 

01:38:05
CY Instead of working 84 hours a week, maybe 84 hours a month. 

01:38:05
RICHARD STUART Okay. 

01:38:10
CY And uh, Kim would probably be working full-time, putting her degree to use. 

01:38:15
RICHARD STUART 40 hours a week? 

01:38:15
KIM Probably less. 

01:38:20
RICHARD STUART And then, what, what else, what else is in that picture? 

01:38:20
CY Children would still be there, be going to school. Um, hopefully I could spend more time with them than I do now. And uh, enjoying the good life. Uh, starting to reap some of the benefits of the seeds we've been sowing for the last couple of years. 

01:38:40
RICHARD STUART And how would you, I mean, what, how would you spend your free time? Why near the water? What would you be doing? 

01:38:45
CY I love the water. I could sit in fro-, by the Gulf, by the ocean all day and literally do nothing, just daydream, watching the waves wash up on the shore. 

01:38:55
RICHARD STUART Do you wanna sit and rock and watch the waves with him? 

01:39:00
KIM I love the water too. And we both enjoy like, walking along the beaches. It's a family activity, you know, also, I think, as far as having the children there. 

01:39:05
CY So, with a pina colada in my hand. 

01:39:10
RICHARD STUART Is it gonna happen? 

01:39:15
CY Yes, I think it will. Uh, we've made strides over the last couple years uh, getting to that point. Uh, it's in the near future, when I say near future, within the next five years, uh, sooner than that. Uh, we talk about it and we actually have goals uh, to get to that point. Uh, her schooling, uh, we, we've reduced our debt. Uh, we're moving that way. 

01:39:40
RICHARD STUART Okay. Great. We'll come back to you. How about you guys? You're really young and you've got a long way till the future. What's your vision of the future, though? 

01:39:50
MARY KAY Well, John's talked a lot about moving to California which is fine with me. I like the idea also. And um, as, as far as for myself, I'm a childcare trainer, I train parents, and I'd like to get really good at that and help a lot of people cuz it seems, the way things are today, parents and kids are really misunderstood with each other. And um, um, children, you asked earlier about children, and we would like to have some children, and. 

01:40:25
RICHARD STUART How many? 

01:40:30
JOHN 15 or 30? 

01:40:30
RICHARD STUART You want the national average? 2.2? 

01:40:35
JOHN Spare parts. I think one thing that when I, I think about the future and what's, we're gonna need to negotiate is because I think we're, we're, we're both passionate about our careers, and at the same time, we're passionate about really giving quality uh, parenting to our children, and so the time factors, and how do you balance that and, how do you incorporate that. That all seems to be still on the mystery stage. We still dream like we're gonna, you know, uh, so things with our children and to really kind of protect them and also give them independence at the same time. But then, but we also wanna, you know, um, be the do-gooders and to, to go out and to, and to do what we love to do as our, in our careers. 

01:41:15
RICHARD STUART In this future fantasy, who's gonna have the car-, in what se-, can you both have careers and a large family and parent the way you want to, or? 

01:41:25
JOHN Good question. Good question. We, we're kinda like, right now we're almost doing shift work where I'm getting my education for my career and she's working. And then I'm also figuring out when, if you'd like to switch, where you'd be doing your education. And so, and probably that same routine might work with parenting. Who will stay home with the children when they're, when they're young. 

01:41:50
RICHARD STUART Is this an easy problem to solve or is it gonna be a hard one? 

01:42:00
MARY KAY I, I, well I tend to think that, for me, I'd like to get to where I have my own business and I can make my own hours, so if John's working in the evenings, you know, then I could be home or vice versa, however it would work out. So I, I really don't, I don't think so. And we're both invested in being part of the uh, raising of the children so it's not like he's saying, "You've gotta do it," you know? 

01:42:20
JOHN No, sometimes I wanna stay home with them. 

01:42:20
MARY KAY Yeah. 

01:42:25
JOHN Let me raise them, too. 

01:42:25
RICHARD STUART It's not gonna be easy for you to make those decisions. That's why it's really useful to start talking now about what some models of your life would be. You don't, you're not committing yourself to a particular pattern now. What you're doing is kind of reassuring each other that in tinkering, evolving, co-creating a model for the future, you're being respectful of each other's values and each other's goals. Uh, and you're gonna have to come up with several models before you pick one that's really gonna, gonna work. So uh, it's a nice thing to do while you're driving around in uh, uh, and um, uh, kind of uh, enjoying your life in the present, take, take a leap into the future and see if you can create that umbrella of meaning. Um, uh, the optimal future fantasy is one uh, in which both of you get to uh, feel respected and valued and, and achieve the kind of meaningful existence in your life that uh, that, that makes it a, a valid existence. And it takes a lot of fantasizing, a lot of creating images and, and throwing them away and coming up with new ones. Uh, it's a very, very long-term process of respectful uh, introspection and negotiation. 

01:43:55
JON CARLSON So many people are discouraged today in their marriages, and we keep hearing about all the unhappiness in marriage. I'm wondering if this last exercise might not be the panacea because as I thought about it, I get hopeful. And I think part of my depression and discouragement in marriage is that I've lost that hope. Have you thought of it that way, about how to instill this hopefulness in your relationships? 

01:44:20
RICHARD STUART It's not a panacea, but it's one of the essentials, I think, because it gives your uh, marriage a sense of continuity. Uh, it, when you share, when you and your partner negotiate a future fantasy, what you're saying is, we're gonna be together for the long term. It's a statement of loyalty. It's a form of commitment. 

01:44:40
JON CARLSON And that hope for me. 

01:44:45
PAT LOVE When you're dating, that's a real sign, when your partner starts talking about the future and including you, and you think, "Oh, we're going to be together." I love hearing that. That's a good point, though. 

01:44:50
JON CARLSON And that was such a good feeling, but we don't do that too much in marriage, do we? It gets lost. 

01:44:55
PAT LOVE You know, I love to do it. I have to say, this is what, to me, someone once taught me a fantasy is a plan, and I tend to think out loud, so I love this exercise and I love doing it. I think my partner and I probably do this one daily. Maybe that's why I can get away with all that other stuff. 

01:45:10
JON CARLSON What was it like for you, as you fantasized about the future and your relationships with one another? 

01:45:20
KIM For Cy and I, I think it's something that we, also like Pat, you know, tend to do very often, and we're very clear on the same goals. 

01:45:30
RICHARD STUART You were pretty quick on where you were gonna go. 

01:45:30
KIM And uh, and also I like to fantasize life without kids, too. You know, launching them all one of these days. 

01:45:40
RICHARD STUART Good luck. 

01:45:40
KIM And having some time just with the two of us because it's hard to get it now.

JOHN I felt uh, better fantasizing this time around because um, it's probably because your intention that we had this looking into the future to be the last skill because with the acceptance and negotiation skills, I felt more comfortable. It's like, well, yeah, I could, we could safely fantasize. This could really happen if we have, if we use these skills along the way. 

01:46:10
PAT LOVE I liked your conversation with Beverly about making the fantasy concrete. And I remember, years ago I was very skeptical about this whole fantasy experience, and yet at one point, for some reason, I remember I wanted a particular house, I wanted this house and there was no way I was going to have it and, and I actually drew the house and years later, I found that drawing, and I had built the house. I had built that house. It was really uncanny. So I really liked it when you got, when you were asking about the details, and I could imagine you doing that, drawing that beautiful picture.

RICHARD STUART Yeah, everybody has their personal things or their, their hobbyhorses. Mine is abandonment. I mean I ask Barbara probably five times a week if she's gonna stay with me. Barbara will roll her eyes sometimes and look at me, you know, very lovingly and say, "Would I be talking about where we're gonna live 20 years from now if I were planning to leave you?" Uh, the most reassuring thing she can do to help quell my anxieties about being left are to talk about the future with me. 

01:47:20
JON CARLSON And all of these futures are positive, too. The kind of things that we hope will happen. Upbeat. And so much of our conversation is that other part. You know, I think that's why people are depressed so much because they live in the past and can't, you know catapult into the future. 

01:47:40
RICHARD STUART The future fantasies tell you what the purpose is of solving all the problems in the present. 

01:47:45
JON CARLSON Oh, wow. 

01:47:45
PAT LOVE Good point, good point. 

01:47:50
