Brief Couples Therapy

Jon Carlson, PsyD, EdD, ABPP 

00:00:35
JON CARLSON  Now I don't know how much you know about the work of Alfred Adler, but Adler was the type of therapist who used to like to do work like this. He kind of thought that problems in the world are universal, so problems that couple might have are probably the very same problems that the audience has. Families very much the same way, so he talked about the universality of problems. And I don't knew as I understanding things, none of us lives life without problems, you know. The Jewish tradition has a story that when we pass away, we go to a place and there is trees, they're called Sorrow Trees; and all of the sorrows are placed upon the trees and if you want to you can walk around and you can pick any tree you want in case you think other people got a better deal. And people sometimes wander for days, but they always come back and they take their own sorrow tree. So, we talk about the normalness of problems, when we get married we make that wild, it says this is gonna be for better or worse and it should be better and worse because we all get both. So what we're gonna be doing today is, we're going to be talking about how Adler might conduct the demonstration like this. And we have a couple with us today Valerie and Garen have volunteered to do this. They've been married almost two years and I had them fill out a few forms ahead of time, which we can talk about as we go through this process, but maybe it will help their anxiety a little bit if we get them involved. And you agreed to do this, and what was it that you hoped would happen? I'd like to hear from each of you. Fewer to leave here today and this would be a good experience for you, what would have to happen? 

00:02:40
VALERIE Well, we've only been married a couple of years and we've both been married before and we have failed marriages. And so, we were hoping to take away from this something that would help prevent that from happening. 

00:02:50
JON CARLSON Okay. So kind of a prevention? 

00:02:55
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:02:55
GAREN Yeah. 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON Okay. And how about for you? 

00:03:00
GAREN I'm just open to the experience, just to take whatever, not having any firm expectations or goals, but just... 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:03:10
GAREN Mind the experience. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON Okay. All right. So Valerie has a very kind of a specific goal and yours is just open to learning, it sounds like, yeah. So, let's go through a few things in your marriage and maybe we can do something like take a temperature of your marriage and see how it's going today. So if you were to take a look at a few variables, like religion for example, is that a plus or minus for the two of you. 

00:03:35
VALERIE Plus. 

00:03:35
GAREN  Plus. 

00:03:40
JON CARLSON It'd be a plus. So, it’s your compatibility there? 

00:03:40
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:03:40
GAREN Hmmm. 

00:03:40
JON CARLSON And you guys go to Church is at a part of your life? 

00:03:45
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:03:45
GAREN Hmmm. 

00:03:45
JON CARLSON A big part of your life? 

00:03:45
VALERIE Yes. 

00:03:45
GAREN Hmmm. 

00:03:45
JON CARLSON  Yeah, okay. And how about children? Do you have children between? 

00:03:55
VALERIE No. 

00:03:55
GAREN No. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Do you each have children? 

00:03:55
VALERIE Yes. 

00:03:55
GAREN Yes. 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON And how many do you have here and...? 

00:04:00
VALERIE I have three. 

00:04:00
JON CARLSON You have three and...? 

00:04:00
GAREN I have two. 

00:04:00
JON CARLSON And you have two. And are the children a challenge for you? 

00:04:05
VALERIE At times. 

00:04:05
JON CARLSON At times, can you talk about that? 

00:04:10
VALERIE Hmmm. Well, they are, all five children are adults. And week ago today, my son and his wife and their baby moved in, so we're adjusting to having another family... 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON Okay, okay. 

00:04:25
VALERIE Living with us. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON Okay. So there will be one issue, would be kind of the boomeranging thing, where the kids go out and then come back, and how about at your end? 

00:04:40
GAREN My two children are kind of diametrically oppose, my daughters are very much together, young professional, just bought her own home. My son is kind of a train wreck, just not able to find his place in life, floundering and dealing with some mental illness. 

00:04:55
JON CARLSON So you've got lot of worry about your son, your one son? 

00:05:00
GAREN Hmmm. 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON Okay. How about in terms of parenting behaviors? You guys -- do you think you are good parents or good grandparents, I guess, in this one? 

00:05:10
VALERIE I have three grandchildren, actually. Better grandparent, I think, than parent. Probably, I have times when I don't set boundaries where I should with my children. 

00:05:25
JON CARLSON Okay. And how about you Garen? 

00:05:30
GAREN I'm probably, I don't know, some day is too rigid and some day is too lax. 

00:05:35
JON CARLSON Okay, so you are. 

00:05:35
GAREN I think probably the consistency is. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON You're kind of a mystery as a parent, we never know who is gonna be there. Yeah. And how about each others parent -- parenting? Are you okay? Do you think the other person is a good parent? 

00:05:50
VALERIE I do. I think he's a good parent. 

00:05:50
JON CARLSON Okay. And you have concerns? 

00:05:55
GAREN I think, she's a great parent. It depends on what perspective you're asking, you know, does it come from. 

00:06:00
JON CARLSON Tell us the one, where she isn't the good parent that you're thinking about? 

00:06:05
GAREN  Her kids run over, take advantage of her. 

00:06:10
JON CARLSON Alright. So sort of what you talked about, about not setting the boundaries and now you've got three more moving home, a son, a daughter-in-law and a grandchild. Okay. 

00:06:20
VALERIE Right. 

00:06:20
JON CARLSON  Now how about, for fun, what do you guys do, I mean, is it -- often say fun, we often say that three-lettered word in marriage, and everyone things it’s sex, which we can talk about, but it's really fun. 

00:06:35
GAREN That's fun. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON It’s really fun, I mean, you know, and what do you do for fun? 

00:06:35
VALERIE  Well, right now, we're both in a counseling psychology program and we're little better than halfway through. So it doesn't leave a whole lot of time right now, but we did spend a time in Greece with our class this summer, so that was fun. 

00:06:55
JON CARLSON Okay. So travelling was fun. Yeah I was trying to thinking graduate school, I’d never really describe that as fun. 

00:07:00
VALERIE  Yeah, just. 

00:07:05
JON CARLSON But like what would you do if you just have some free time? I know it's a young marriage, but... 

00:07:10
VALERIE Oh! We do a lot of talking. We sit out by the pool and listen to music, and... 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON Same kind of music. 

00:07:15
VALERIE  Hmmm. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, okay. 

00:07:20
GAREN We watch movies. 

00:07:20
JON CARLSON Watch movies, yeah. 

00:07:25
GAREN Diagnose the characters. 

00:07:25
JON CARLSON Diagnose the characters, I see. 

00:07:25
VALERIE  We sit there with our DSM. 

00:07:30
GAREN We actually watch it with our DSMs. 

00:07:35
JON CARLSON Yeah, okay. 

00:07:35
GAREN It's quite sad, actually. My daughter accuses us, she says, there is gotta be some diagnosis for diagnosing. 

00:07:40
JON CARLSON  You must work on that. 

00:07:45
GAREN Work on that, yeah. 

00:07:45
JON CARLSON And so, how about work? There's working issue? I mean, school, that's part of your job now 'cos there's working issue for either of you? 

00:07:55
VALERIE No, I -- not for me. I work full-time and I'm a First Grade teacher, I've been teaching for – it’s my 17th year, and I still love it, I still get up in the morning can't wait to get there. 

00:08:05
JON CARLSON  Wow! 

00:08:10
VALERIE And over the years you get better at it, so you don't put as much time in. So I have the time then to study when I get home, so that's good. And so... 

00:08:15
JON CARLSON  And is her work a problem for you? 

00:08:20
GAREN No, she's feeding us, so that's really good. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:08:25
GAREN No, not really. I mean, she really enjoys it and I go there on occasion and spend time with her, and the kids. So... 

00:08:35
JON CARLSON And how about your work? 

00:08:35
GAREN  Yeah, I've been unemployed for almost four years. So... 

00:08:40
JON CARLSON  Okay. Is that a problem for the relationship, do you think? 

00:08:45
GAREN  I wouldn’t say a problem, it's a challenge. 

00:08:50
JON CARLSON Yeah. Cos’ men are really -- pretty hard wired to wanna provide and... 

00:08:55
VALERIE  And it causes depression for him at times. So... 

00:09:00
JON CARLSON All right. It's kind of a role change and probably what you’re used to, okay. Okay, now how about friends? Do you guys have friends? 

00:09:10
VALERIE Oh! Yeah. 

00:09:10
GAREN Oh! Lots of friends. 

00:09:10
JON CARLSON  Do you have friends that are problem for each other? 

00:09:15
VALERIE  No. 

00:09:20
GAREN Problem for us or? 

00:09:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, I mean, like I don't want her hanging out, so and so or him being with so and so? 

00:09:25
VALERIE No, we pretty well do everything together. And most of our friends are couples as well. And so, when we get together, we get together with other couples. 

00:09:30
JON CARLSON  Okay. You get along fine with good friends. 

00:09:35
GAREN Yeah. 

00:09:35
JON CARLSON  Okay. Now how about getting along with each others families of origin? Are they nearby or not nearby or how does that fit into the picture? 

00:09:45
VALERIE  Well, initially, both -- on from both sides, they didn't want us to get married. They said it was too fast because within six months, we were ready to get married. 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON  Okay. So you didn't have their blessing? 

00:10:00
VALERIE No. 

00:10:00
JON CARLSON Okay. And are they nearby? 

00:10:05
VALERIE My sister and her husband and children are nearby. And his family lives -- and his daughter, and his family lives in Mississippi, the rest of 'em, but they all love us now. We're all fine now. 

00:10:15
JON CARLSON  Oh! 

00:10:20
VALERIE It just took a while. 

00:10:20
JON CARLSON Okay. So you won them over? 

00:10:20
VALERIE  Hmmm. 

00:10:25
JON CARLSON Yeah. Okay. And do you have regular contact with your families? 

00:10:30
GAREN Oh! Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:35
JON CARLSON Like how often would you talk to your family? 

00:10:35
GAREN One sister that I talk to virtually everyday. 

00:10:40
JON CARLSON Everyday, okay. And how about in your family? 

00:10:40
VALERIE  Well, the only family member I have contact with is my sister, and probably once a week. 

00:10:50
JON CARLSON Okay. So a little less frequent at your end; and maybe more at your end. What I did is, I had you know, you guys fill out some forms, and what I'd like to do is to go over these forms and see if this makes any sense to you. Now Valerie's is on top, so, I guess, you'll be the first one. What I had them do is to fill out a lifestyle form little questionnaire, and this is available I think on my website at joncarlson.org, if anybody wanted to download it. And I see from looking at this form that in the family you're the second of four children. You have an older brother. 

00:11:30
VALERIE The second of five children. 

00:11:30
JON CARLSON Second of five children Okay. Got it. I think, I got it, I didn't want to lose one here, so and you're the oldest girl in the family, right? 

00:11:45
VALERIE Yes. 

00:11:45
JON CARLSON And so, when I had you fill out some forms, it said that you found your place in the family through your intelligence, hard work, good grades, helping around the house, being obedient, you're the least critical of others, you're the most thoughtful and considerate, you were the most selfish, you had the least temper, you had... 

00:12:05
VALERIE I was the most selfish? 

00:12:10
JON CARLSON That's what it says, but maybe that's not true. Let's take you off here cos’ that didn't fit, you left that blank, maybe you weren't even on the chart at other end, okay. So let's make her the least selfish. The least temper, the least materialistic and the least boiled. Is that sound like you and desire to excel? Is that sound like her? 

00:12:30
VALERIE  Hmmm. 

00:12:35
JON CARLSON Okay. Let's look at yours, Garen, and let’s see if there... 

00:12:35
GAREN I think, we're out of time, aren't we? 

00:12:40
JON CARLSON And if we look at yours, I'm gonna look at this correctly this time. It shows that you're the youngest of four. 

00:12:50
GAREN Correct. 

00:12:50
JON CARLSON Okay. So you're the second of five, but the oldest girl; and you're the not only youngest of four, but you're the only boy, you got three older sisters. Hmmm! I bet people to get in some guesses about what that might lead to. 

00:13:05
VALERIE  They'll be right too. 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON That would be right, if that's the case. 

00:13:10
GAREN Yeah. 

00:13:10
JON CARLSON  It is what it is, right. 

00:13:15
GAREN It is. 

00:13:15
JON CARLSON And we have done here on the form, it says that you found your pace by working the least hard, getting the least good grades in school, helping around the house the least, being the least obedient, being the most rebellious, being the least critical of others, let’s see, and having the least good behavior, most athletic, most spoiled and got in trouble the most. Does it sound like him? 

00:13:50
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:13:50
JON CARLSON It does. Sound like you. 

00:13:55
GAREN Yeah. It sound like I was. 

00:13:55
JON CARLSON Like you were. Got it. Okay. 

00:13:55
GAREN Yeah, right. 

00:14:00
JON CARLSON Right. And so, we just -- we think about the difference in your birth order in terms of what those experiences might have been like for you. What was your older brother like, just for...? 

00:14:10
VALERIE Well, he really... 

00:14:10
JON CARLSON  He laughed, so I don't know what this means, okay. 

00:14:15
VALERIE He repeated couple grades, then ended up dropping out early, very rebellious, very wild. 

00:14:25
JON CARLSON So it's probably fair to say that you, what we call leaped over him. 

00:14:30
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:14:30
JON CARLSON And you became like the oldest in the family. 

00:14:30
VALERIE  Right. 

00:14:35
JON CARLSON Kind of dethroned him, if you will, as the oldest. And so, now we've got kind of an oldest and the youngest. And there is a different world view that we have, I'm gonna look at that. Now there is some other questions that I asked, but I'd like to go on to the, what we call early recollections. And maybe some of you are familiar with early recollections. But in early recollections what we ask people to do is remember back as far as you can in your past to the first thing you can actually remember, you can actually see, not something that somebody told you. So let's start with Garen's, he is first one. And it says, he was four, five years old, my family left me a sleeping appeal at Church. My dad was a Preacher, a Pastor. I remember waking up in the dark sanctuary without any fear at all, looking around me and thinking, oh! Well, someone will come and get me. I laid back down, I went to sleep and I woke up when my dad scoop me up in his arms and laid me over his shoulder, I immediately went back to sleep. Does that – was that accurate or what was it like? 

00:15:50
GAREN Yeah. 

00:15:50
JON CARLSON And let me look at one of yours here and see what we have for your early memories and what we might be able to learn from this. And this was one that stands out when you were four, I was four years old dressed in only a diaper, my dad was yelling at me, I was crying, he was seeing that I was going to act like a baby, I was gonna be treated like a baby, and he pushed me out the door, it was daylight, I stood on the steps trying to get back in the house; I was afraid that somebody would see me. Wow! Would you guys make anything out of those recollections and kind of how things might be today for how the two of you approach life? 

00:16:35
VALERIE  Hmmm. 

00:16:40
JON CARLSON You’ve got a big grin on your face. What are you thinking? 

00:16:45
VALERIE Very, very different. 

00:16:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. Kind of different memories in terms of, yeah, sounds like he is feeling so secure, somebody is gonna take care of me. And you're feeling like I have to really look out for myself. Okay. Is that play out for you guys today in terms of how you guys do things in your marriage? 

00:17:05
VALERIE  I'm always looking ahead and trying to figure out like the worst case scenario before I do something. How this is going to end up and really thinking --trying to things through before I do it. 

00:17:25
JON CARLSON Okay. So you're trying to really plan and control what's gonna happen. And how about from your end? Are you pretty much like that too? 

00:17:35
GAREN  I wanna make sure she doesn't get locked out of that house anymore. 

00:17:40
JON CARLSON  Okay. So, the antidote for that, kind of like, the opposite that you more laid back and taking things as they come? 

00:17:50
GAREN No laid back wouldn't describe me at all. 

00:17:55
JON CARLSON Okay. Hmmm. 

00:17:55
GAREN  But, I guess, the first, the first reaction that I have, of course, we were writing those together. All the same night the first reaction that I had was, I wanted to go find her father. 

00:18:10
JON CARLSON  Hmmm. Right. And so, that was the protectiveness that you might have that nobody should do that to your wife. 

00:18:20
GAREN And that definitely plays out in her marriage because I perceive at time that people do treat her less than I believe she needs to be treated. 

00:18:35
JON CARLSON And so that would be your role to try to look out for her. 

00:18:35
GAREN Yeah, I’m a little aggressive. 

00:18:40
JON CARLSON Hmmm. And do you like that when he looks out for you? 

00:18:40
VALERIE  No, not always. No. 

00:18:45
JON CARLSON Ever. 

00:18:45
VALERIE  Sometimes. 

00:18:50
JON CARLSON Sometimes. 

00:18:50
VALERIE Sometimes, it's nice knowing that someone has my back. 

00:18:50
JON CARLSON  Okay. Now, if we take just some of this information without going into lot of depth on it for right now. You're concerned about, like you talked about worrying about your kids moving back in the house, what's your biggest worry? 

00:19:10
VALERIE That they won't move out. 

00:19:10
JON CARLSON  And what would be the worst part about that? 

00:19:20
VALERIE Well, I guess, the short time that we did have where it was just the two of us, it was just kind of almost a heaven place where we can go out and work and come home and study and it's peaceful in earth. Not a lot of drama, so it's a very calm, very happy, calm place. 

00:19:45
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:19:45
VALERIE And, I guess, with going into this internship and working full time and going to school, taking four classes, it's -- it was already gonna be a lot. 

00:19:55
JON CARLSON And now having the kids move home. 

00:19:55
VALERIE Right. So now, I'm just concerned about coming home and what kind of drama is there going to be to deal with. 

00:20:05
JON CARLSON Okay. And how about you, Garen? What do you think in terms of having them there? 

00:20:15
GAREN  It's not really different from what she's thinking. I guess, my approach to it is a little bit different. 

00:20:25
JON CARLSON How would your approach be? 

00:20:25
GAREN  Either Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde, it's very little in between. 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON  Can you give us an example of what Dr. Jekyll would do? 

00:20:40
GAREN  He would cook supper for however many people came in and love being with them and serve them diligently, and make sure that they had a good experience. Blow up pool, toys and... 

00:20:55
JON CARLSON And how about Mr. Hyde? 

00:21:00
GAREN He would put their stuff in the garage when they crossed a particular boundary. 

00:21:10
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:21:10
VALERIE Well, I'm kind of looking at this op as an opportunity... 

00:21:15
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:21:15
VALERIE To help them, to give 'em a foot-up, you know and really that we could even make a huge difference in their lives by being able to help them during his time. But then, I'm afraid that they're going to do something that he's not going to like, and it's gonna start, I'm gonna have to start being the middleman, and being the go. 

00:21:45
JON CARLSON You're afraid of that or you know that that's gonna happen? 

00:21:45
VALERIE I've experienced that in the past, and I guess, I'm just concerned that I'm gonna end up being the one to try to keep peace and it’s going to be exhausting. 

00:21:50
JON CARLSON Wow! Would she like to do Sheriff? 

00:21:55
GAREN  Maybe wasn't assumed role. 

00:22:05
JON CARLSON And then, that would make you the outlaw, the guy we can't tell what he's gonna do. So how will you work that out at your end, if we were just to say, how will you be a united front as parents? Have you talked about that? I mean, if you don't have that kind of a position about how we're gonna be, it's probably pretty likely that you will be in the middle. 

00:22:30
VALERIE It's like, I don't know what's going to actually come up. And, you know, so I don't know how I'm supposed to handle it when it does come up, if I completely side with him and I don't agree with him... 

00:22:45
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:22:45
VALERIE I mean, I don't wanna have to side with one or the other, if I don't agree. I wanna be able to have my say in it, but if I side with him, then I'm gonna alienate them; and if I side them, I'm gonna alienate him because they're my children. 

00:23:00
JON CARLSON So you've got this all figured out, how to lose? Okay. 

00:23:00
VALERIE  I guess so. 

00:23:05
JON CARLSON What were you thinking? You were started to say something moment ago when she jumped in. 

00:23:10
GAREN Well, we have -- we talk about it. That’s one thing that we agreed to do when going in to this marriage was to. 

00:23:20
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:23:20
GAREN Very definitely keep the lines of communication open and, you know, not shut down, and that's difficult for me at times because I tend to withdraw. But when it's her children, since I became a stepparent so late in their lives, the youngest is 19, the oldest is 29, I've made no attempts to become daddy. 

00:23:50
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:23:50
GAREN But I still want to be recognized for the role that I have assumed, did not let things get flip flop. So that the 19-year-old is running my life, I think we should be in charge of running our life and they are addendums to our life. 

00:24:10
JON CARLSON Sounds good in theory, so you guys agree on that. 

00:24:10
VALERIE But there is another dynamic to this thing... 

00:24:15
JON CARLSON Another dynamic, okay. 

00:24:15
VALERIE is that the children's father passed away four years ago and he basically drank himself to death, so they are still very angry about it. And so, there is this resentment toward him, especially with my youngest. 

00:24:35
JON CARLSON Because? 

00:24:35
VALERIE Well, when my son moved in last week and she came and -- to sit us down and tell us that we needed to -- that he needed to stay completely out of it, and let me handle everything. And so, we let her know -- know this is our home and so he is going to have a say. So her idea is that, he has no right to say anything. So... 

00:25:00
JON CARLSON  So you agree with that that doesn't work for you? You're not sure? 

00:25:10
VALERIE No, it doesn't work. 

00:25:10
JON CARLSON What would work? 

00:25:10
VALERIE Her stay out of it. So we've been telling her, that we appreciate your concern, and, but we've got this is... 

00:25:20
JON CARLSON Would it surprise you to know that she's probably right, that generally the role of somebody who is gonna come in as a stepparent like this is not the parent. But would just concentrate on being their friend and the two of you would be partners, and you can make your decisions, but you are the bottom line with the kids. 

00:25:40
VALERIE I suppose so, cos’ that's how it is with me with his children. 

00:25:45
JON CARLSON You're their friend? 

00:25:45
VALERIE Right. I actually work with his daughter. But they're not living with us though. 

00:25:50
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:25:50
VALERIE So. 

00:25:50
JON CARLSON  But what would the rule be, it seem to me that you guys would have some rules, and what are the rules that you have, that you've set up for them? 

00:26:00
VALERIE  For the children? 

00:26:05
JON CARLSON Right. I mean, it sounds like that they, you're wondering, is one of the rules they can stay forever? 

00:26:10
VALERIE No, no. We've did put a time limit on it. 

00:26:10
JON CARLSON What is? Which is? 

00:26:10
VALERIE Three to four months. 

00:26:15
JON CARLSON Okay. Is it three months or four months? 

00:26:15
VALERIE We'll see. And I wanted to extend that as long as necessary. So... 

00:26:20
JON CARLSON So we have three to four months, and that's negotiable. So it's like a suggestion, all right. 

00:26:30
VALERIE Well, but I just can't see put them out on the street. 

00:26:30
JON CARLSON  That might be. But I just asked you, what your goal, what your rule is? So, and it sounds like you don't have one? 

00:26:40
VALERIE  Well! We said three to four months, right. 

00:26:45
JON CARLSON  What does that mean to you? 

00:26:55
GAREN  My goal is to help him. 

00:27:05
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:27:05
GAREN Not to enable him. 

00:27:05
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:27:05
GAREN With that understood. I'm not interested in anything long-term for sure. And my negotiable putting in three months and four months, you know, at 120 days. Am I gonna put their stuff in the garage. No, that's not the kind of guy I am, but I want to try to hold in balance that the main concern that I have at this point is our relationship, not my relationship with my children or my relationship with her children, but our relationship. That's what I wanna protect and that's what I wanna strengthen. 

00:27:50
JON CARLSON Those sound really admirable, but I'm still down to this whole idea about what's gonna happen? And you said, you didn't wanna enable, you know, and the kids, and if you set a goal that really isn't a goal, don't you send the message we don't think you will be able to do it? I mean, maybe, you need to set something a little more realistic like you have 18 months, if it's only three months that's fine, but within 18 months, this is what we'd like to see happen. We’d like you to begin to pay rent at 10 to 12 months, and that money will be put aside for you, so at the end of six more months you'll have the down payment for your next place and the first months rent. Is that kind of plan and you might be able to do? 

00:28:35
GAREN  Sure. 

00:28:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. That seem to be... 

00:28:40
VALERIE More reasonable. 

00:28:40
JON CARLSON More reasonable. And can you stay out of it though it she handles it? Because they're her children and you're shaking your head. 

00:28:50
GAREN A qualified yes. 

00:28:50
JON CARLSON  A qualified yes, how does that work? Cos’ you don't wanna, you know, you want to show her that you have confidence in her? 

00:29:00
GAREN  Yeah, I do. And I really do. 

00:29:05
JON CARLSON Okay. Here comes but, all right. So let's use and I really do and... 

00:29:10
GAREN And I have a lot of confidence in me as well. 

00:29:15
JON CARLSON But it's not your problem, that's her problem. 

00:29:20
GAREN Rephrase that? 

00:29:20
JON CARLSON Well, they're her kids and she needs to handle, she's the person that's going to be working with them, you're just their friend. 

00:29:30
GAREN  Yeah, I guess, I don't see it at that way. 

00:29:35
JON CARLSON Okay. How do you see it? 

00:29:40
GAREN I have -- when I consider my friend, it's someone that I have a mutual connection with that we've -- that we've developed mutually. And this is different, because we developed our relationship mutually, but our children, they didn't really have a choice in this. 

00:30:15
JON CARLSON That's right. But you'd want to treat them friendly? 

00:30:15
GAREN Yeah. I want to be friendly. 

00:30:20
JON CARLSON Okay. That's right. 

00:30:20
GAREN Sure. I wanna be friendly, but... 

00:30:20
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:30:20
GAREN I know that I can't be daddy. 

00:30:25
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:30:25
GAREN And I'm okay with that. But I'm not gonna be door mat either, and what's... 

00:30:30
JON CARLSON And how would that work, if you were door mat? What would that mean? 

00:30:35
GAREN That means, I would never have an opinion, I would never have... 

00:30:40
JON CARLSON Well you will always have an opinion to share with your wife about her children. 

00:30:40
GAREN Yeah. 

00:30:40
JON CARLSON  Not with her children because they're not your children they're her children. So, I think, if you’ll get into a triangle if you do it that way, it might work good for you, I don't think it will work good for you and I think it would really destructive for us. 

00:31:00
GAREN Hmmm. But I do discuss it with her, and I went with her, primarily. And she went with me, I would say, you know... 

00:31:10
VALERIE I know, but, I think, you know, when they first moved in and I said, well, let me just go ahead and sit down and talk with them; and you said, I don't agree, I think I should be part of that, so I said, okay. And we did, and it went well. 

00:31:25
JON CARLSON Hmmm. 

00:31:30
VALERIE We explained it, you know we’d want him to get work and start putting his money away, and that we didn't want him to give us any of the money, but to put it aside and that his wife to work as well. You know, and that we would help them find some affordable day care for the baby. So... 

00:31:50
JON CARLSON So that's all that you're gonna do and that sounds like that's enabling them. 

00:31:55
VALERIE It is. 

00:31:55
JON CARLSON Does it sound like that to you? 

00:32:05
VALERIE No. 

00:32:05
JON CARLSON You're gonna find day care for them... 

00:32:05
VALERIE Well, no, I mean, we had some connections, cos’ they are not from here... 

00:32:10
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:32:10
VALERIE And so, I just told them, I said I’ll into our church and see if we could maybe get them... 

00:32:15
JON CARLSON Lined up there. 

00:32:15
VALERIE Right. And then, I have a student whose parents owned a day care, I thought, I might ask them. 

00:32:25
JON CARLSON That sounds a little different than... 

00:32:25
VALERIE Yeah, okay. 

00:32:25
JON CARLSON Hmmm! Okay. So what's gonna happen then, when they don't get work? 

00:32:30
VALERIE Well, he's already working. So he got work within a couple of days, so that worked out good. With her, I don't know because that's also another dynamic of him coming home and it just being her and feeling uncomfortable with that. So... 

00:32:55
JON CARLSON Him coming home, meaning? 

00:32:55
VALERIE Him being home with just the daughter. 

00:32:55
JON CARLSON  Your husband. 

00:33:00
VALERIE They didn't know him before, right. 

00:33:00
JON CARLSON Being home just with the daughter. 

00:33:05
VALERIE He just met my son cos’ he's been in England, he's been in the Air Force, he just got out of the Air Force. So... 

00:33:10
JON CARLSON So this really awkward. 

00:33:10
VALERIE He doesn't really know them, right. 

00:33:15
JON CARLSON And so, is there a way that that's gonna happen that they're gonna get to know one another? 

00:33:20
VALERIE We've been spending time and we have dinner. 

00:33:20
JON CARLSON Time together and talking. And do you have regular meetings in that, in the family? 

00:33:25
VALERIE Well, it's only been a week. So, you mean, with the girls, and... 

00:33:30
JON CARLSON I mean, do you have it planned? You'll have family meetings to talk about how things going? 

00:33:30
VALERIE We didn't do that. 

00:33:35
JON CARLSON Is that something that might work? 

00:33:35
VALERIE His family is known for a family meeting, so I guess that would be. 

00:33:40
JON CARLSON His family did that. 

00:33:40
VALERIE They're known for their family meetings. 

00:33:40
JON CARLSON They're known for their family meetings, okay. 

00:33:40
VALERIE Yeah. 

00:33:45
JON CARLSON I wonder how you’re known, but... 

00:33:50
GAREN It was... well, I guess, I need to tell that story. Four months before we were married, a little over four months before we were married, after Thanksgiving dinner, my sisters, who can best be described as strong, southern woman, hyphenated and bold, underlined, decided we needed to have a family meeting. So the Thanksgiving dishes were cleared away and let the games begin. 

00:34:30
JON CARLSON I see. That's how they're known for this? Were you part of this family meeting or it was just. 

00:34:35
VALERIE I just kind of sat and watch to, it was very intimidating. 

00:34:40
JON CARLSON Is that the kind of meetings you want to have at your house? 

00:34:40
VALERIE No. 

00:34:40
JON CARLSON No, okay. 

00:34:40
GAREN No me neither. 

00:34:45
JON CARLSON You neither, okay. So what kind of things would you discuss if you had a family meeting to keep the talking open? 

00:34:50
GAREN We kind of did have one. I thought it went real well, we sat down and shared with him some of our expectations and desires. And then shared with him some of the things that we would be willing to do, we'll be willing to make sure you get to work until we can find you a car, we'll help you find a house when it comes time. 

00:35:15
JON CARLSON Okay. So was it both ways or just a one way family meeting in which you talked about all that you were going to do? 

00:35:25
GAREN I think it went both ways. 

00:35:25
VALERIE Yeah, then -- and he was sharing what his, you know he said well, I'm absolutely wanting to work and start putting some money aside and this is temporary and I appreciate it, and I hope that you'll be open if there is anything that we're not doing or are doing that it's going to offend you or bother you, if you would just come right out and tell us. 

00:35:45
JON CARLSON I see. So it sounds like, he's pretty optimistic about not willing to stay there very long. But you’re not too sure. 

00:35:55
VALERIE Well, my oldest daughter moved and she was gonna stay till she finish final school on and she stayed year and a half. 

00:36:00
JON CARLSON I see. So you have a history of people stand a little longer than they plan. Can you add some words to that what it says aha? 

00:36:20
GAREN She too a very, very strong degree without giving details, took advantage of our good nature, of our economic situation and perpetrated some things that. 

00:36:35
JON CARLSON Did she take advantage or did you participate in that? 

00:36:40
GAREN No, it was planned as time. 

00:36:40
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:36:45
GAREN It was planned as time. 

00:36:45
JON CARLSON And when you discovered what was going on that's when she moved out. So you're able to be firm when she learned about something going on that was inappropriate? 

00:36:55
VALERIE Deception. 

00:36:55
JON CARLSON And is that likely the same way you'll be able to operate this time? As a couple in terms of something isn't appropriate? 

00:37:05
GAREN I think so, yeah. 

00:37:05
JON CARLSON Yeah. Does that help you any, when you think about that? 

00:37:10
VALERIE It does. 

00:37:10
JON CARLSON I mean cos’ that just fumbling around, so you're trying to figure out, you know exactly what the issues were. But it seems like you're doing a lot right. You’ve started the dialogue with them, you haven't let it get out of hand before as soon as you found out that it did, you took action on it and you were willing to do that. 

00:37:30
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:37:30
GAREN But even at that, we didn't exclude our daughter out of our life. We said. 

00:37:35
JON CARLSON Right. I know. 

00:37:35
GAREN We still wanna have a relationship with you, we still want to spend time with you and our two grandchildren. But there are certain things that we need you to understand, these are unacceptable behaviors and if he want the privilege of being here. 

00:37:55
JON CARLSON And was Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde home at that time too? 

00:38:00
VALERIE It's pretty easy-going through the entire thing until the one particular episode. 

00:38:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:38:10
VALERIE And he was pretty firm, he never raises his voice or anything, but it was kind of scary to me, I guess. 

00:38:20
JON CARLSON But it sounds like, it was warranted in the one hand of firmness part of other. 

00:38:25
VALERIE It was. 

00:38:25
JON CARLSON Maybe the way he was, wasn't appropriate, but the fact that was timed up. 

00:38:30
VALERIE Yeah. 

00:38:30
JON CARLSON Put down a boundary, which is kind of scary for you anyway. 

00:38:30
VALERIE Hmmm. 

00:38:35
JON CARLSON Yeah. Okay. Do you think he's really this Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde? 

00:38:40
VALERIE No. 

00:38:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. I mean it sounds like that’s a -- it’s kind of a storyline that doesn't seem to fit. 

00:38:45
VALERIE He's not a scary person, no. He's a very nice person. But he's firm when he's firm. 

00:38:55
JON CARLSON Oh! What do you think of that when you get that feedback? 

00:39:00
GAREN  That makes me feel very good, it makes me understand this is exactly the reason that I was attracted to her. I was in a very long, very desperately dysfunctional marriage for 24 years with someone, who not only didn't understand me, but didn't really want to. 

00:39:25
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:39:25
GAREN And. 

00:39:30
JON CARLSON So that means a lot to have somebody who understands you? 

00:39:30
GAREN She understood me so quickly, that's why both of our families reacted the way they did, but they weren’t in the dynamic and I could understand their concern if I was 21, but I am 51. So. 

00:39:45
JON CARLSON And what was your role in that first marriage in terms of that kind of, you know allowing that to go on? 

00:39:55
GAREN My role? 

00:39:55
JON CARLSON Yeah. And how do you contribute to not being understood? 

00:40:05
GAREN How do I contribute to not being understood. 

00:40:05
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:40:10
GAREN I guess, I'm very complex. 

00:40:10
JON CARLSON  Any other ways? I mean, I think, we’re all kind of complex with you? 

00:40:15
GAREN Yeah. I don’t know, I mean I'm pretty open, so I try to communicate. 

00:40:25
JON CARLSON Do you see him as transparent? He is somebody who wants to share what's going on and wants to do it with you or somebody who withdraws. 

00:40:40
VALERIE He withdraws when he is in pain or when he does go into some mild depressions at times. 

00:40:45
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:40:45
GAREN She's being kind. 

00:40:50
JON CARLSON Okay. So you're really good at being depressed at times. 

00:40:50
GAREN Hmmm. 

00:40:50
JON CARLSON And when you depressed what is message does that send your partner? Stay away from me. I'll figure this out myself. 

00:41:05
GAREN That's probably what it looks like, but that's not really what I want. 

00:41:05
JON CARLSON But that maybe that? 

00:41:10
GAREN Yeah. 

00:41:10
JON CARLSON I'm not suggesting that, but that would seem like the message you're sending. 

00:41:10
GAREN Yeah. I can see where I would be sending that message. 

00:41:15
JON CARLSON What message do you wanna send? 

00:41:20
GAREN Just be with me. 

00:41:20
JON CARLSON What exactly does that mean? I mean, if she would -- I mean, do you know how to be with him? 

00:41:30
VALERIE Well, when he's sad. He was like stay in bed and I just, I can't stand to stay in bed and I can't stand to be around a lot of gloominess, I mean, I'm going into therapy, maybe I shouldn't treat depressed clients. 

00:41:50
JON CARLSON I don't know about that, I just, I can say do you know how to be with him? 

00:41:50
VALERIE I -- not in that way. I want to make him get up and get dressed and go outside and go walking. 

00:42:00
JON CARLSON That's the way you would like him to be with you. 

00:42:00
VALERIE Right. 

00:42:05
JON CARLSON Often what we do is we treat people the way we wanna be treated, you know, and rather than treating them the way they wanna be treated. So if she were with you, what would she be doing? 

00:42:20
GAREN Holding me. Yeah, that's pretty much it. 

00:42:25
JON CARLSON Just hold me. 

00:42:25
GAREN That's pretty much it. And not forever, I mean, just give me sometime. 

00:42:30
JON CARLSON So the best way she would be with you is to hold you and not to try to put running shoes on you or to try to get you moving. 

00:42:40
GAREN Yeah, that doesn't work. 

00:42:45
VALERIE And I can be that way with other people, but with him I'm more like that commercial where the guy throws the box or tissues and says, all right, cry baby, come on, jump up, get snap out of it and that's how I am with him. 

00:43:00
JON CARLSON I see. And you have no control over that? 

00:43:05
VALERIE I do. 

00:43:05
JON CARLSON Oh! So that's the way you choose to be and I wonder what that is. 

00:43:10
VALERIE I can't stand to see him like that. 

00:43:10
JON CARLSON Because? 

00:43:15
VALERIE I think it makes me feel unsecure, maybe. 

00:43:20
JON CARLSON Hmmm! So kind of like, he's abandoning you, not pulling his weight and so then you get angry on him. 

00:43:25
VALERIE Like he is disappeared and he is kind of, he’s gone away. 

00:43:25
JON CARLSON Right. Yeah. We could probably guess that that's the kind of thing that may have happened somewhere else in your life. That's why that become so vulnerable where the people you should be able to count on might have disappeared. Yeah. And you see that happening. But now that you know this, that's what he really wants. Do you think you could do something different? 

00:43:55
VALERIE I could, I don't know for like days, I couldn't do it. 

00:44:00
JON CARLSON Well, he said he didn't want you to do it for days. So if he were to walk up to you and just hug you and say, I love you, and then I want you to work this out for yourself, would that be helpful? 

00:44:10
GAREN Oh! Yeah. I mean, she didn't have to stay there for even hours. 

00:44:15
JON CARLSON About just a minute. A one minute hug, can we live with that? 

00:44:20
GAREN Yeah, that would be good. 

00:44:20
VALERIE I do that. 

00:44:25
JON CARLSON That's why she. 

00:44:25
GAREN Yeah. 

00:44:25
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:44:25
VALERIE But then I'm like, okay, now let's get up. 

00:44:25
JON CARLSON That's the chapter we wanna leave out. Okay. Right. I love you, no matter how you are. Yeah. And what is that that he could do that would make that easier for you to do? 

00:44:40
VALERIE  Maybe put a time limit on the amount of time he's gonna spend in that. 

00:44:50
JON CARLSON What would that look like? 

00:44:50
VALERIE Maybe like couple of hours instead of a couple of days. 

00:45:00
JON CARLSON Anything like that possible? I mean, if she were supporting you and caring for you, could you reduce the amount of downtime? 

00:45:10
GAREN  Yeah. Yeah, I could and I have and. 

00:45:20
JON CARLSON Will that be a gift you could give her? 

00:45:20
GAREN Yeah. I actually did one day. Hardly enough it was on another Thanksgiving. I don’t know. Just survive the Thanksgiving, but I had, had a very disparaging conversation with my son that just immediately sent me into a very, very profound depression. 

00:45:40
JON CARLSON Right, right. Well, I'm sure you have all kinds of reasons for how to get into a depression? 

00:45:45
GAREN  But I made myself get up after like two hours. 

00:45:50
JON CARLSON But you also sounds like you know how to get out of it too. 

00:45:55
GAREN Yeah. I said, okay, I got to get up. 

00:45:55
JON CARLSON And so, she could support you in the way that you wanna be supported. Could you be more available for her? 

00:46:05
GAREN Oh! Absolutely. 

00:46:05
JON CARLSON So what would you say when you went into this place of gloom, I mean, do you think you had the place you could say, two hours, set a timer? 

00:46:10
GAREN Yeah. I've got a new phone and it's got, actually, a stopwatch on it. So I could. 

00:46:20
JON CARLSON That grim tells me you kind of like that idea. Yeah. And if you were to do something like that, it will be a lot easier to be loving, caring, supportive in the way. 

00:46:25
VALERIE  Oh, that I would know, for sure, that it wasn't gonna last. 

00:46:30
JON CARLSON Well, I don't know, we don't know that for sure, anyway. 

00:46:35
VALERIE I know. 

00:46:35
JON CARLSON One of the thing we know is whether we're doing our part to make sure that it doesn't last than loving him in the way that he wants to be loved. Yeah. Cos’ you can't control the world, that's gonna do it was, did you know that? It's kind of hard not to clearly accept this no matter how much we plan. So we can control this, how we respond. And so, he's gonna be a different partner than he was in the other marriage. He said that, you would go to him and care for him in the way he wants to be cared for. And he's gonna be less complex, he's gonna be more available, more open. Now we're kind of at the end of our time and we've kind of gone around to your lot of different things we’ve talked about. What would you takeaway with you when you leave here today? 

00:47:30
VALERIE Well, I'm thinking that we need to start having a family meetings. 

00:47:35
JON CARLSON Okay. Alright. 

00:47:35
VALERIE  And that when he does have his depressive episodes that I need to be more understanding. 

00:47:45
JON CARLSON And how would you do that? 

00:47:45
VALERIE  Not going to give him hugs and leave him alone for a couple of hours and not try to make him get up and. 

00:47:55
JON CARLSON So I'm gonna hug you and just tell you, I love you and then leave. Say I have confidence in you. Okay. And what are you gonna do? 

00:48:00
GAREN  I'm gonna give her the primary role with our kids. 

00:48:10
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:10
GAREN I wanna be a part of the process, but I know my understanding in her shadow to do that. 

00:48:20
JON CARLSON Okay. 

00:48:20
GAREN I really don't. 

00:48:20
JON CARLSON All right. Good. 

00:48:20
GAREN But with the understanding that. 

00:48:25
JON CARLSON And. 

00:48:25
GAREN When she is in danger, I'm going to come out with the shadows. 

00:48:30
JON CARLSON Will you ask her if she needs your help, if you'll do that, I think, it will work? 

00:48:35
GAREN Yeah. 

00:48:35
JON CARLSON If you could say, do you need my help, she’ll say yes or no? 

00:48:40
GAREN Yeah. I'm gonna ask you. 

00:48:40
JON CARLSON  Anything else you're gonna do? 

00:48:45
GAREN  I wanna get up after two hours. 

00:48:55
JON CARLSON I was the youngest child too, and I know how we just kind of do these things, you know. And we probably have a lot more control over, than we led on to. I wanna thank you guys, that was really helpful. Thank you for helping us all learn. Thank you. 

00:49:05
VALERIE  Thank you. 

00:49:10
GAREN Thank you. 

00:49:10
JON CARLSON So we have a little bit of time left. And I'm not sure what comments or what questions that you might have? Yeah, yeah somebody popping right up here. The questions need to be directed at me though, but they'll listen on and they may consult me if I need. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN Just to understand what you were saying about the stepparent role. 

00:49:35
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN Cos’ I have three step kids of my own, yet the, my wife wants me to be kind of disciplinary in it. 

00:49:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN So I wanna just understand, if I understood you correctly, which I'm not supposed to be. 

00:49:45
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN And if that's the case, could I get to know it for my wife? 

00:49:50
JON CARLSON You know. I think people watch the Brady Bunch and they just think that these things just should happen. And you'd have to earn the right to be in that role, and it can’t happen in times. But you don't get it just by loving their mother or loving their father. I think it's earned and it's earned by being a friend, being caring, being supportive. And then you support each other in raising their children. And I think if you do that, you'll be fine in a stepfamily. Yeah. And you tell your wife, you have confidence in her. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN  Hi. I was thinking on, when you were talking about, when he is in a depression and you wanna get him up and all that, immediately into my mind popped, I was wondering, if you were thinking and if I was waiting to see, if you were gonna ask her what I was thinking because of her history with being go getter and all that, when she's saying, she felt insecure and useless, was she feeling any kind of inconvenience. 

00:50:55
JON CARLSON  Feeling... 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Was it not convenient for her husband to be needing that and not getting up because she wanted to get up? 

00:51:05
JON CARLSON Yeah. You know I think that's a good question to look about how there is a collusion here, is that what you’re thinking that goes on, yeah. And I think that’s something we'd wanna see, to see over time, if we were to meet with them again, if that isn't just continuing, yeah. But for our first session, I probably wouldn't go there right away. We -- I think, we gave them more than plenty to work with just to try to maybe restore some semblance of order in the family just with this new intrusion or intrusions, is that a good work? That's a good work, okay. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN And I thought this was marvelous how through the combination of your tools and that they use to write through and bring to session and range of your questions you got that so much content of that relationship and all the way through to the current process, it was moved very quickly in. 

00:52:05
JON CARLSON Thank you. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN But I'm also curious, how – I am curious and really interested in how you make the mental bridge between asking the couple questions posed, looking for problems and challenges, and yet coming to solutions quickly at a slightly different methodology than other, maybe solution focused frame. So if you could explore that with me, I would appreciate it. 

00:52:30
JON CARLSON You know, I’d have to think about a lot of what I do in terms of, you know I'm using a model and I'm trying to look for their strengths for one thing. And they have a lot of strengths that bring to the table. I'm also trying to look for some areas where they have some thoughts, they have some beliefs about how to do things that are probably causing them trouble. I believe most couples don't fall short not because they don't work hard at things, but they work hard at doing the wrong things. And one of the things that I found when I looked at the inventory, we would know by an oldest child and the youngest child is, generally an oldest child is probably -- is gonna over function in a case like this. And an under -- a youngest child is gonna under function, whatever that might look like, which is sort of this collusion that you're talking about. And, I think, we want to try to avoid that as much as we can and we want to give them each some responsibilities that they can work on. So I'm operating with some general principles. I go down this list of events that people have like religion, money, or work, or these different areas it's just the place where there are arenas, where they either get along or they don't get along. And you'll find somewhere some real strengths and you can say, you guys really do a good job with that. You know, a lot of couple have troubles with religion, but, yeah, that’s really a strength for you guys. Lot of couples don't have ways to have fun, but you can have fun and it’s your strength. And there are so many, you know, strengths that they bring to the table. A lot of times when you go to see a therapist, you don't do that, you focus on all what's wrong? What's the pathology is? And you're feeling just like this is hopeless. And, I think, they left your feeling pretty hopeful, you know, and that they weren't hopeful to begin with, but with some hope of some things they could go away from. I learn from Judy Beck, that one of the things that's really helpful is it, people wanna go no matter how fancy our therapy is and all these great insights, people want to leave with something, that's really personal, intangible. And that's what good therapy is to clients. No matter how wonderful we think we are, the clients want something to take away that's gonna relief their suffering. Yeah. 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN  I wanna first thank you all because there is nothing as valuable as really watching and listening. I guess, I was surprised that there was no discussion about what you might be presenting in terms of a presenting issue. I don't know what had happened previously, you know whether there was something particular that they might have wanted to focus in on today? 

00:55:20
JON CARLSON  Well, the issue that they had was plenty in the family. And that's what she talked about was her fear and that was the one they dealt with. If you take a couple that's been married for two years, they're probably still in some step of infatuation too. And so, yeah, hey, and who would blame her, okay. But there is some stage of infatuation that's they're in. And so there is a certain amount of reality that we have to look at here too, so, about how far we go. Okay. Our time is up. We’ve got our signals. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you.
