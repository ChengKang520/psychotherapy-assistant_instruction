JENNIFER ABEL Good afternoon, or good morning, if you are joining us from the West Coast. This is "Nine Best Strategies to Treat Panic in 90 Minutes". I'm Dr. Jennifer Abel. I have no conflicts of interest. I'm not employed by a pharmaceutical company or a behavioral health company that can benefit any way from this seminar. I'll start with some of the boring stuff, the panic attack definition, the DSM-5, an abrupt surge of intense fear, intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and includes at least four of the following symptoms. Palpitations or cardi… tachycardia, sweating, trembling or shaking, dyspnea which is shortness of breath, feeling of choking, chest pain or chest discomfort, nausea or abdominal distress, feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint, derealization or depersonalization. Now, your client isn't gonna come to you and say, "I'm suffering from depersonalization," unless they've been on the internet. In… In that case, they definitely will tell you that they are suffering from derealization or depersonalization. But usually they'll say, "I feel spacey. I feel disconnected. I feel like things aren't real. Or I feel like I'm dreaming," very, very common symptom too. Paraesthesia, which is numbness or tingling sensations. Chills or hot flushes, hot flushes do differentiate from what women my age get the hot flashes. And then there are two, uh… cognitive criteria on the list for panic attack. One is the fear of going crazy and sometimes that's related to that derealization, depersonalization, when people feel that spacey, disconnected feeling. They are concerned that they're going crazy, but they might have that fear aside from that symptom if they know someone who has gone crazy themselves. Fear of dying is not uncommon. And it's not one of the criteria for panic attack. But fear of embarrassment is also very common and something for you to look for. Umm… So in order to meet criteria for panic disorder, there has to be, umm… at least one of the attacks has to be followed by a full month of consistent worry either about having additional panic attacks or the consequences of those attacks, like the fear of going crazy or the fear of dying, or a significant change in behavior, maladaptive change in behavior. Usually that's avoidance behaviors, avoiding going in places where the person is afraid that they might have a panic attack. But sometimes, it's checking behavior, and I will talk much more about those along later in the seminar. So it's… And it can't, the panic attacks cannot be solely in response to a medical problem, substance abuse or any other mental health disorder, including anxiety disorders. So, umm… so for instance, if someone has panic attacks and it's only when driving a car, or they have panic attacks and it's only in the course of their OCD, then they don't meet criteria for panic disorder. So that's one of the exciting things in DSM-5, is the panic attacks specifier. So in… in DSM-4-R, if an individual had OCD and panic attacks, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference from their diagnosis if they were having panic attacks or not. So because panic attacks can't be coded, but they can occur in the context of any other mental health disorder or medical condition, DSM-5 brought about this new panic attack specifier. So for instance, if I were fearful of dogs, if I had a phobia of dogs and the only time that I have panic attacks is in the presence of dogs or other dog stimuli, then I would be coded as "Specific phobia, dog with panic attacks." It sounds like I'm afraid of dogs that have panic attacks. Fine, when I'm around dogs that are depressed, but put me around a dog with panic attacks and… and I'm a mess. So, umm… I would like to talk about some research from Alicia Murray(ph) and her colleagues, very fascinating results from this study. What Alicia and her colleagues did was to hook people up to 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. These are the clients that have the out of the blue, the unexpected panic attacks. And she also recorded a panic button. So the participants were instructed to hit this panic button the instant they were feeling like they were having a panic attack. And the results were really astounding. There were significant decreases in carbon dioxide, which is a marker for hyperventilation, and significant increases in heart rate and respiration for a full hour in most of the participants, a full hour before they pressed that panic button. And then after they pressed that panic button, there was… it continued to rise, but not as significantly as it did in the hour before they hit the panic button. The other finding is that they were chronically hyperventilating. Now, that doesn't mean that they were… like you may have seen people panicking, but more of a low level of chest breathing and may be a little bit heavier breathing than what is healthy. So, the implications of her study is that we want to learn to catch anxiety in the hour before panic occurs. And another implication is to do diaphragmatic breathing given that there were significant decreases in carbon dioxide for an hour before the panic, and that these folks are chronically hyperventilated. We want to teach them how to breathe correctly. Umm… And then there is some research that adds credence to this, that when hyperventilation is significant in panic, that diaphragmatic breathing is an effective treatment. Anxiety occurs in a spiral. And it occurs in a spiral of interactions between physical sensations, thoughts, images, emotions, and behaviors. So what we feel affects how we think. What we think affects how we behave. How we behave affects how we feel, both physiologically and emotionally. So, in this panic spiral… I'm gonna turn this around for you. Didn't realize I didn't have animation. The spiral occurs pretty rapidly and usually ends with escape. So the person has the panic attack and they have all these symptoms and that's the experience that the folks have, is that rapid symptom after symptom after symptom, but those symptoms, according to Murray's studies are going on long before the person is aware of those symptoms. So, according to her and other research that we see with worry, as well as Craske and Barlow, advocate doing some detective work and trying to figure out what's going on before the anxiety begins, and doing diaphragmatic breathing, and using other coping strategies in addition to the most important aspect which is… which are exposure strategies that we'll get to later. But we want to nip the anxiety in the bud, nip the panic in the bud. And we see this in the medical community all the time. where we… medical insurance companies spend millions if not billions of dollars trying to detect disease early because for every case that they save, umm… they… they save millions of dollars in treatment. So, like colonoscopies, and mammograms, prostrate exams as well as things like Lyme disease that if we catch them early, the treatment is minimal and the suffering is minimal. But as therapists, we are usually not really trained to catch things early, to nip anxiety in the bud. And what we want to do is catch it when it's at its weakest. So when we nip things in the bud, we catch it when it's at the weakest and it's easier to treat. The other thing is that every time our clients are able to prevent that spiral from happening, they are no longer practicing it, so that they're weakening it in memory. It's like putting the panic spiral in an emotional sling so it gets weaker. And then every time the person is able to catch that anxiety early, nip it in the bud, then a new habit is strengthened. Now, before you start treatment, any good clinicist is gonna do some assessment. So this panic attack assessment form is recommended and you have my permission to duplicate this and use this for your own purposes. So I have all of the, umm… all of the symptoms of a panic attack and then I have a space for other because sometimes there are idiosyncratic symptoms that people will have. And it's useful to find out which is the most feared symptom, and even more useful to find out what's the first symptom that they experience, and how often do they experience these symptoms. Another very important part of the assessment is do these monitoring forms, to give these monitoring forms to clients, and ask that they fill these out the instant that they are having a panic attack or as soon after having a panic attack as possible. Because we are not good historians, especially when we are anxious we may be more likely to forget things. So, we want to do some detective work by having the client indicate what time they had the panic, what the situation was, where were they, who were they with, what was going on. As well as what was leading up to the panic so that we can play some detective and figure out what's going on early on and again, circling the first symptom, underlining the worst symptom. So that brings us to diaphragmatic breathing. And with… I used to be reluctant to teach people diaphragmatic breathing for a couple of reasons. One is that people tend to, people with anxiety particularly, they worry a lot. They worry that they are doing it right, and trying to breathe appropriately may actually add anxiety. There is also some studies that indicate that it can interfere with exposure-based therapies. However, given the fact that, umm… what Alicia Murray found and the information that says that it is helpful for people who hyperventilate. Umm… When people are breathing too shallow, I do advocate for teaching this, particularly if they are complaining about those symptoms during a panic attack. So, umm… looking, I encourage you to look at the diagram as well while I'm talking about this. But we can only get oxygen, let's go back to that previous slide, we can only get oxygen into the top of the lungs. We can't get oxygen into the bottom of the lungs. And, so when people breathe shallow, they're gonna overcompensate by breathing faster. So you want to breathe using that muscle that has the, umm… slashes through them, that is shaped like an arch, that's the diaphragm. And when we breathe in, we're flattening those muscles as our stomach expands, and that's really expanding the bottom of our lungs allowing the air to get into the bottom of the lungs where we can get oxygen into the blood stream. So, when people breathe too shallow, they overcompensate by breathing faster, trying to get enough oxygen into the blood stream so their chest muscles can tighten. And… And also, too much carbon dioxide will be released because we're breathing twice as fast. So we're breathing twice as fast, we're gonna breathe out twice as much carbon dioxide. And when carbon dioxide levels decrease, two things happen. One is that the hemoglobin in the blood holds on to that oxygen, not allowing it to be released to the organs. The other thing is that when carbon dioxide levels go down, the blood vessels actually narrow, so that there is a smaller conduit, if you will, to take that blood to the organ systems. Now, one of those organs is the brain. And the brain is going to send signals to another part of the brain that's gonna make us feel like we're not getting enough air and causes to increase that respiration, which only exacerbates things. So there is this vicious cycle that can cause people to hyperventilate. And if you see people using a paper bag umm… when they are having a panic attack, when they are hyperventilating, it's because they are restoring the carbon dioxide levels and that allows the… the hemoglobin to let go off the oxygen and for the blood vessels to dilate, allowing more blood to get to the organs. So some tips regarding teaching diaphragmatic breathing, one is to just encourage people to watch babies and small children, as well as demonstrating it yourself by putting one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach and showing that you're only breathing from your diaphragm, that your chest is not moving. And you want to breathe at a normal rate and… and normal-sized breath, may be edging a little bit to the slower side. When people think of deep breathing instead of thinking deep into the lungs, like diaphragmatic breathing, they're thinking deep breath, like and that's not at all relaxing. So, some other ways to help people to engage that diaphragm, because they may be so accustomed to breathing shallow that it's very difficult for them to learn from the diaphragm. And if they seem discouraged, encourage them, "No, this is great because the fact that you're having a difficult time doing this is a sure sign that this is a habit and that this habit is certainly contributing to your panic attacks." And now, you can learn to breathe in a healthy way that will help to reduce those panic attacks and that discomfort that you get from being out of breath so frequently. So showing that if they're having a hard time with it, sometimes I'll be distracting and say something like noticing the surfaces beneath you, being aware of the position of your arms and legs. And now just pushing your stomach back and letting your stomach relax. Push your stomach out, let your stomach relax, and now allowing the air to expand your stomach. And what they're really doing again is expanding the bottom of lungs. But it feels like you're pushing your stomach out. When we warm our hands with our breath, like this, we're engaging those muscles too, so it's another way to help people. Blowing out a candle from afar, we're gonna need to engage those muscles as well. And then, sometimes for some reason, when people just think of breathing into their sides or ballerinas think of breathing into the small of their back, for some reason that image helps better than trying to breathe into the bottom of the lungs. You can also use a large straw. And if all else fails, lying face down, actually you can feel your diaphragm moving better if you're lying face down while breathing and engaging the diaphragm. So in an effort to find relief from panic attacks, clients usually engage in avoidance and escape behaviors. But unfortunately, engaging in these behaviors negatively reinforce anxiety umm… such that your clients temporarily avoid or decrease anxiety only to strengthen that anxiety in the long run. So, negative reinforcement, people get confused about negative reinforcement. So, I wanted to show you a chart on operant conditioning and point out that negative reinforcement is not to be confused with negative punishment or positive punishment. People often confuse those three things. So, in operant condition we can… we either increase a behavior or decrease a behavior, and we do that by either applying a positive stimulus or removing a negative stimulus. So, with negative reinforcement, we're removing a negative stimulus that increases behavior. So for instance, if Emma avoids driving, she's going to avoid feeling anxious when driving, but she's also going to reinforce her avoidance behavior and thereby increase or at least maintain the anxiety that she has about her driving phobia. Some examples of negative reinforcement with panic attacks, we often see this OCD like checking. People will check their heart rate. They might check the internet compulsively. They may do… check other vitals. I've seen people check their blood sugar even when they don't have diabetes, checking blood pressure, looking in the mirror to see if one is flush or if they're pale and then seeking reassurance from other people or even self-reassuring. And that's self reassurance often takes on this ping-pong or seesaw like appearance. So, it may be something like, "My heart is healthy. Well, but what if the doctor missed something? I'm really afraid I'm gonna have a heart attack. No, my heart is healthy. Umm… Jennifer told me that a panic attack has never caused a heart attack, that panic attacks can't cause heart attacks unless the person has an unhealthy heart and my heart is fine. But what if she's wrong and what if the doctors are wrong? What if they got my test results mixed up? I'm fine. This is silly." So, that's the kind of ping-ponging that we see. And that unfortunately serves to maintain anxiety. And prayer is very similar to that, that people feel anxious and then they pray. They feel anxious and then they pray, or that they pray repeatedly to get through a situation. And then also negatively reinforcing is safety behaviors. Safety behaviors like taking a bottle of water along, keeping a Xanax in one's purse or wallet, taking a person along that they consider to feel to… feel safe with them. And then avoidance of places or situations where they've had a panic attack or where they felt very panicky, umm… you know, like our example of Emma who avoids driving because she's had panic attacks while driving, and then actually taking Xanax or another fast acting drug. Xanax actually reinforces, umm… our anxiety, when we take a Xanax, and as well as drinking or other fast acting drugs. So, to stop this cycle of negative reinforcement, we want to prevent people from negatively reinforcing these behaviors. Response prevention is getting the person to stop engaging in these negatively reinforcing avoidance behaviors or escape behaviors. Sometimes just giving people a rationale and asking them to stop checking can be… can… can work, can work very well. And asking them to stop checking, asking them to stop taking the safety items with them. You can integrate those into a umm… into a hierarchy which we'll see later. Stop asking for reassurance from other people, stop reassuring oneself. Changing prayer habits, this one's a little tricky because you don't want to interfere with a person's religious values. And… And I don't, and in fact in every case, I've probably seen 10 or 12 people who use prayer religiously to negatively reinforce their anxiety. And, umm… what I've done in every case that's worked out fine is given them a rationale and then ask them, "What were your prayer habits before you started having panic attacks?" And let's just say for instance that they say, "Well, I prayed at every meal, and I prayed at bedtime, and I prayed at church." So, my encouragement is for them to continue to pray during those times, in fact you can even pray for the strength to get through your… your panic attacks. And you can even pray to thank God for a good day. But what I'd like for you to stop doing is pray when you're feeling anxious, because you're negatively reinforcing that anxiety. So, we usually want to, in addition to doing the response prevention, combine this with exposure. In fact, I'm sure you've all heard of exposure and response prevention. Because exposure is the opposite of avoidance, exposure is a way to prevent that anxiety from being reinforced. So that old adage is true. The old adage is true that the best way to overcome our fears is absolutely to face those fears. Or one client strategy, "Whenever I have a panic attack, I put a brown paper bag over my mouth and drink all the rum inside. It seems to help." That's actually negatively reinforcing. So, we wouldn't want to encourage that. But because people who have panic aren't fearful necessarily of what's going on out there, they're fearful of the physiological symptoms of a panic attack. In fact, a lot of those people who have phobias would tell you, "Well, if I was assured that I'm not going to have a panic attack, I'd actually have no problem driving or no problem getting on a plane. If I knew that I wasn't gonna have a panic attack, I would be a lot more comfortable in a social situation." Umm… What they're fearful of is those physical symptoms that they get, that increase in heart rate, the sweating, the feeling like they're going to faint. So, we do interoceptive exposure. We systematically bring on the physiological symptoms of a panic attack so that people get comfortable with being uncomfortable. They habituate and are desensitized. So, habituation is a physiological process umm… and, so for instance, if someone is driving, for instance, and they're anxious and their heart is pounding, their heart is only going to pound for so long before it's going to come down. And then desensitization is more of a psychological term that they psychologically they feel no longer fearful. They're desensitized to those situations. Interoceptive exposure can be incredibly effective if the individual is not on a benzodiazepine or taking other drugs that are short-acting. SSRIs are all fine. If the person takes, umm… other medications that are long acting, most of those medications are fine. Umm… And uh… It's… It's so effective, I actually, I'm seeing a client now who came to me and said, "My granddaughter said that you cured her of her panic in one session." And it'd been three or four years prior to that that I had seen this client. And I went and looked in her file and sure enough, I had done interoceptive exposure and my new client said she has, hadn't had a panic attack since that one trial of… of interoceptive exposure. Umm… But typically, I don't even do interoceptive exposure at first session. But umm… I've seen many clients who have been finished with panic attacks in three or four sessions. You want to get medical clearance before doing interoceptive exposure. You may not need it if your client has been to a couple of physicians or even one physician and then say that they have a clean bill of health. As long as they've been treated for this set of symptoms, you may not need to contact a physician. But if they have a medical problem and panic attacks, for instance, if they have asthma, you may want to get some clearance for the exercises that you want to do. You also want to be certain that the person doesn't have medical problems. Most of the time, they've seen a physician or two, or three, or four, been to the emergency room once or twice or more before they've come to see you, but some people are afraid of taking medication or they just hate the idea of taking medication, so they do come to you first. Remember that even though they're having panic attacks, doesn't preclude a medical problem. So, you want to treat that gently because the person has anxiety. So, you don't want to say, "Oh, I think you really need to get this checked out. You haven't seen a doctor, oh my… oh my goodness! Go see a doctor." No, Instead, what I'll do is something like this. Well, you know, it's clear that you're having panic attacks and panic attacks explain these symptoms. These are all very common symptoms of a panic attack. And just because you have panic, you know, anybody who has panic it doesn't mean that they don't have a medical issue in addition to that. And, you know, you're no more likely to have a problem with your heart than any other 35-year-old guy. But you know just to be on the safe side, you may want to get it checked out. Okay. So interoceptive exposure, couldn't find my little coffee straw, but those very small straws that are about that big, around that short, that you stir coffee with, those are the kinds of straws that I'm talking about. If you breathe through that straw, it gives the person that feeling of the shortness of breath. And, umm… and you want to have them repeat that and use the same amount of time each time. Uh… And then that brings up those symptoms. And I'm gonna show you an example of this in a… in a few moments. Umm… Then there's the rapid breathing. And you want to use, oops! I'm sorry. You, umm… Let me go back to that, you want to use a metronome and there is an app for that. I use the Steinway app. And, umm… We… I do at least a 120 beats per minute, usually between 120 and 145. And I'll do at least a minute of rapid breathing and usually no more than two. So, it looked like this. Huh-huh-huh. Okay. And some… some clients have poor rhythm. So, you'd want to do… Huh-huh-huh. I find if they have a visual, they do better. And show them Huh-huh-huh, rather than… huh-huh-huh or Huh! Huh! Huh! You know, you want to use the middle of the road. Likewise, with the head side to side for dizziness, umm… I use no more than a 100 beats per minute. This happens to be 96. And turning one's head side to side, 30 seconds is plenty for that. And for bringing up lightheadedness, putting one's head down between one's knees and getting up rapidly. I think I can demonstrate that. Be down for 30 seconds and then kind of come up rapidly, but don't jerk up. And then staring, it turns out that just staring at something can actually bring on a panic attack and may explain some of the panic attacks that your clients might be experiencing at… at times. Umm… If they have a panic attack while they're in a lecture and staring at the… at the professor while they're under fluorescent lights. Because fluorescent lights have a flicker that can affect the brain and can cause us to feel that derealization or disconnected feeling, which is why so many clients have panic attacks at school or at umm… the grocery store. And umm… And what do they have in emergency rooms where people go for panic attacks? Of course, they have fluorescent lights which can only exacerbate in some cases. The… the clients panic. And fluorescent lights, I actually have fluorescent lights in our storage room at the office, so that I can demonstrate to people and do an assessment, see if fluorescent lights are an issue. And this is a big eye-opener and education for a lot of clients because when they go under these fluorescent lights and they start to feel that disconnected, derealization feeling, it's a big aha moment for them and it normalizes it for them, and then… and then contrasting that by taking them outside of the… the closet or the storage room and exposing them to natural light, so they can feel the difference. Running up the stairs and this isn't a complete list of… of interoceptive exposure exercises, my book, "Treatment Resistant Anxiety, Worry & Panic," just became available at Passy(ph). And it has a more complete list and… and further explanation of symptoms matching symptoms to the interoceptive exposure exercises. And has some guidelines on… on how much time you might want to use. So, when doing interoceptive exposure, be sure that you administer those, uh… those, umm… assessment tools that I presented a little bit earlier and provide a rationale. That rationale for exposure goes something like this, like, you know, "It turns out that the best way to overcome your fears is to face them. Have you had any experiences with that?" And asking them if they've had any experiences. If they… If they have a difficult time coming up with an example of something that they've done that they were fearful of, that they've become less fearful of by doing it repeatedly, you can, for many people, the first time that they drove on the highway, on the freeway, they felt anxious and after the 10th time, they felt significantly less anxious. And by the 15th, 20th time, they're playing with the radio, talking to their friend, etcetera, etcetera… umm… texting, which they shouldn't be doing, obviously. Umm… You want to determine the first and worst too. I always start with the first. The idea here is that if the person gets comfortable with that first symptom, then the cascade of spirals is not going to continue. They'll be comfortable with that first symptom instead of going into the spiral. However, it's not at all unusual for people to say, "You know, I haven't had a panic attack in several weeks, but I'm still afraid of having one", because they're still afraid of that worst symptom. So you may have to address that. And umm… we want to do interceptive near the beginning of the session because it might take as long as 45minsutes, 50 minutes for their anxiety to come down, usually it's less time than that, but just in case. Umm… And if there is umm… So during interoceptive exposure, you want to try an anxiety, an exercise until it brings on the same kind of anxiety that we get in the beginning of a panic attack. And you want to keep consistent, repeat the anxiety until it's reduced at to… And I just use this… use this for clients when they go home, that they have, something that they can remember, that you want your anxiety to get down to a three or below, and/or come down three points. So, if they start at a seven and you get it down to a three, you've accomplished both. If they started at a umm… a at an eight and you could get it down to a five, then you've accomplished one of those. Umm… If the response is too high, if they have a panic attack, which happens very infrequently, I think I've had it happen twice with clients, rather than letting them escape, that's gonna negatively reinforce, really encourage, you kind of force them, but really encourage them to pick something that will be less challenging. So for instance, if… if doing a minute of breathing through that straw, umm… if they… if they stop at 48 seconds, you might say "Well, how about if we try it for 30 seconds instead?" That's just one example. Then, if there's little or no response, if they do these exercises, you keep trying these exercises but there's little or no response, umm… consider combining the exercises. So for instance, breathing through the straw while under fluorescent lights and staring. And then rule out acceptance. I have seen that where I've asked people to do these exercises, and in asking them to do these exercises, you're giving them the permission to have anxiety and they're giving themselves the permission to have anxiety. And often, it has that paradoxical effect of acceptance, that they are actually accepting the symptoms. So, it's not causing them anxiety. But here's an example of an interoceptive exposure exercise with a real person. And he had, we used a zero to eight scale with him, and he had that derealization feeling. So, umm… we had him staring under fluorescent lights. And that brought on some significant anxiety, a six-and-a-half. And, umm… the symptoms were very similar to panic and the symptoms were pretty intense as well. So you notice on the left are the symptoms that are induced by the exercise. So with any of us, if we turn our head from side to side several times, we're going to feel dizzy and we're likely to feel nauseous. That's one, umm… one criterion that we want to get is how much physical symptoms were generated by the exercise. And then we want to know what the reaction to that, the anxious reaction, the fearful reaction of that is, so that we can repeat that and see that come down. As we've seen in this, by the fourth time, we got a significant reduction in anxiety. And by the ninth or the last time, we have, I'm sorry, the eighth or the last time, we got down to a two. So just within the course of about, uh… 16, 18 minutes because we did a minute in and about a minute out of recovery, less than 20 minutes, this person's anxiety came down from 6.5 down to a 2. And this is on an eight point scale, so that's pretty impressive. So that when this person experiences those symptoms out in his world, it's not gonna bother him as much. And it didn't, he got better quite quickly. So traditional in vivo exposure, we have an example of this woman who's in an MRI and the lab tech says, "Okay, Mrs. Dunn, we're going to slide you in this MRI, scan your brain, and see if we can find out why you've been having these episodes of claustrophobia." So, that's how most of you think of traditional exposure, when you think of exposure that's what most of you think of. In vivo just means in life. So in real life, we're using this exposure. And I've got a film clip from Jesus Henry Christ on… on exposure to sensodianiaphobiea or fear of being dizzy. And I'm going to turn this around for you so that you can see this video.

JENNIFER ABEL Okay. So I have good news and bad news regarding, uh… in vivo exposure. The good news is that clients don't usually scream like that. The bad news is they don't usually get over it quite that quickly either. So again, we want to present a similar rationale for in vivo exposure that we did for, umm… for interoceptive exposure. And you want to build a hierarchy, keeping safety behaviors in mind. And hierarchy, I'm gonna show you an example here in a moment. But a hierarchy is simply a list of… of situations that the person knows will cause some anxiety and giving those a rating. And you want to keep the safety behaviors in mind. So for instance, if someone had a panic attack at a grocery store umm… and it was the Piggly Wiggly, umm… they and, they are… were afraid of being embarrassed, afraid of having a panic attack and being embarrassed, going at 6 o'clock to the Piggly Wiggly by themselves would be a lot more difficult than, for instance, going to the ANP where they didn't have a panic attack that maybe is a smaller, more familiar store and going at 10 o'clock at night with a safe person. Okay. So when doing traditional exposure, you want to begin by facing moderately fearful places and situations first until the anxiety comes down. Let that anxiety come down, otherwise they're going to negatively reinforce by escaping too early. And, umm… the reason that we want to do moderately fearful is that if we aim to high, the person may get cold feet and that even is a form of avoidance that could exacerbate or even considered escape that could exacerbate their anxiety. Umm… Or it increases the likelihood that they're gonna actually have a panic attack in that situation, and then that could exacerbate their anxiety as well as have them lose faith in you and they may not come back. If you do too low, it's stuff they're probably doing already or stuff that they could do and then they're not going to feel that encouraged or feel like you helped them that much. Now, for homework, you can have them do those lower things that they've already been doing and then do whatever it is that you've done together. I'll show you some examples here. Here's an example of a hierarchy with a client who had OCD and panic attacks in response to some of the situations that she'd been forced to face. And as you can see, she used a zero to eight scale. So you, if you think on a 10 scale, the 8 is akin to a 10. And I've just highlighted a couple of examples, not washing hands after pumping gas, not washing hands after leaving the grocery store, uh… seven, putting groceries away without wiping each item, not sanitizing her hands after being out in public, six, not washing hands after loading dirty laundry, not washing hands after using… not washing clothes after using a public restroom. And I think that would have been an eight, not washing hands after using a public restroom. Seeing kids on the bleachers and her kids on the bleachers, and not washing her hands after touching the mail… And then the next slide, we have the fours, threes and twos. Umm… So some examples of fours are allowing kids to keep clothes on after a doctor's, a dentist's appointment. And then having her husband use the ladder without washing his hands or changing his socks. And then, you don't need to build a hierarchy to start with exposure. With this particular client, I asked her, "Is there something that we could do? I'm hoping we can come up with something together that would create a significant amount of anxiety for you, that would be challenging for you, but then you're pretty certain would not lead to you having a panic attack." And we came up with shaking my hand and using my pen without washing her hands right in the session before building the hierarchy. Now, umm… the lower items here are things that she could start doing on homework right away and doing consistently every time. So, for instance, not using the sanitize cycle in the washing machine, that's something she could use, she could do every single time she does a little laundry. And not washing her hands after opening cans, cans that she had already sanitized. She was still washing her hands after she opened them. So having her not do that consistently, um… it was good exposure for her. And then twos, also things that she could do consistently, touching postage stamps without washing hands, for instance. So, another way that we can do exposure is using technology to, umm… to do exposure. And umm… I wish I could animate here, but pulling up a Google search or any other search, you always have these options of web, images, videos, etcetera. So we want to make use of the images and the videos. Now, if we had someone who's afraid of dogs and has panic attacks in response to… to dogs, we might want to start with puppies, and do photos of puppies. And if they're particularly fearful, some people, pictures may not bother them at all. They may require doing in vivo exposure with a dog, uh… straight off the bed. I'll also point out that sometimes videos and images don't work because the person says, "Well, I know I'm not actually there, so it's not going to really cause me any anxiety." However, other people are so fearful that even drawings cause anxiety, and photos are too scary. I've seen, umm… just last year, I saw a couple of people, one with a butterfly phobia that we had to start with drawings of butterflies. And another who was afraid of worms that we had to start with cartoons of worms. Umm… So use your search engine, and then you can… you can use your hierarchy. So build up to eventually go to that big dog, umm… using the big dog as, uh… excuse me, this is what I got with the search if I put in big dog. And then when I put in the search for pit bull, so the person may have certain breeds, for instance, that they're more fearful of. You want to get creative with building this hierarchy. Then, once we've done the pictures, the photos, and it might even be easier to integrate, do pictures, then do a video, a funny video, or videos of puppies, or a dog show before even showing photos of a pit bull, or a big dog. So anyway, here we see that I've circled… You can get to videos one of two ways. Everyone knows YouTube. So you could just go to YouTube and do a search for YouTube. So for instance, I put "dogs funny." So you do… you show funny videos. I really suggest the Ultimate Dog Tease. It's hilarious. And, umm… Or you can do a regular search. Put in dog show or dogs funny and then click on videos. And then using the… this media exposure and you can build a hierarchy with that. Now, when you're showing videos, you want to… you want to watch a small clip, no more than 30 seconds before you get a rating. And… And watch them, see if they seem to be getting anxious. And… Or if they're saying, "Wow, this is really making me anxious." And again, we want a moderate level of anxiety. So once you find a moderate to moderately high level, umm… you want to repeat that clip for 20 or 30 seconds. So for instance, I recently saw a guy who was fearful of having his blood drawn. And we showed a clip of the prep of the person meeting the lab tech, seeing the needle, seeing the… the tourniquet, having them put the tourniquet on. Well, that generated enough anxiety so that we just watched about a 20-second clip of putting on the tourniquet. And then, umm… did that repeatedly until the anxiety came down to about a two or a three. Then we moved along in the video and then watched the part where they were actually getting stuck by the needle, umm… and then watched that repeatedly. Then the next one was an injection. An injection, it turned out was a little bit more difficult than having blood drawn, so we did the injection next and watched a video of an injection, watched that clip repeatedly for 20 or 30 seconds until the anxiety came down. In fact, with the… with that injection, you could even do a 10-second clip. Umm… So an example of… of creating a hierarchy might be starting with a cartoon of a puppy, a photo of a small dog, then doing a movie of a… of a puppy, a funny movie, then doing a photo of a larger breed, and then a video of a larger breed, and then, umm… you can also do things like control the sound and the size. So for instance, I'm using this example of someone who had a metophobia, which is the fear of seeing someone vomit or fear of vomiting oneself. And, umm… and these folks are usually pretty anxious about… about this. So, I'll start by showing a clip on my iPhone and turning the sound completely down, muting the sound. And then gradually increasing the sound, and then starting on that smaller window on the computer, and then bringing it on the bigger window of the… the computer. And maybe only listening to the sound, and only listening to the video. You can see there's a lot of things that you can be creative about varying. So, the next type of exposure is imaginal exposure. Umm… So with imaginal exposure, we do things in imagery. And instead of showing a video, we have the person imagine that they're actually in that situation. And again, like the videos, some people will say, "Well, I know I'm not on a plane. So, it doesn't really affect me." Other people get very anxious. In fact, I saw one woman that she actually got less anxious on a plane with real turbulence than she got in the session in imaginal exposure, how I imagine that. Umm… So in order to prep for the magical exposure, sometimes it's good to, for instance, to get a seat map, see a photo of the interior of the plane that that person is actually going to be on, and, uh… or sometimes you can do a real life, umm… viewing before the imaginal exposure. For instance, in our office, we have an elevator. And I'll just say, "Hey, let's just… We're going to do some imaginal exposure. I'm not going to ask you to actually ride the elevator with me. But let's go down and look at it and then we'll do some imaginal exposure. Have you just visualize that you're on it because that'll be easier than actually getting on it." So we walk down to the elevator and press the button and say, "I'd like for you to notice everything that you see in here. You press the button, you hear the ding. You hear the motor of the, umm… the elevator coming up or coming down, and then you hear it stop, you see the doors open, you hear the doors open." And then if they feel comfortable, small exposure. I'll say, "How about if I block the door, and you walk in and… and see the panel, and see what it looks like to be on the inside. And then we go back in the office and then imagine closing your eyes, imagining that we're walking toward the elevator. You've touched the button, ding. You can hear the motors, the elevator coming and the doors are opening. We're walking in and you're touching level five, floor five. The doors are closing and you can feel and hear the elevator moving up." So we want to create, so even when doing that we may want to have the client stand because they're not going to be sitting in the elevator. So you want to have them stand while they're visualizing all of this. Umm… you want to create an environment as similar as possible. So, I have couches in my office. So if I'm having someone imagine that they're on the plane, I'll get my office chair which is much more, it's got a high back, it's got arm rests, umm… it's a lot more like it. And I'll even put sometimes another chair in front, so that the person feels that cramping and… and turn on white noise or sounds of the plane to make it sound as much like that situation as possible. And then, some people are a little hesitant to do this, but it's what the person fears anyway. Some people fear that they're going to get sick on the plane, that they're gonna vomit on the plane, some people just don't like the sense of lost control. But whatever it is that they fear, again they're thinking of it anyway, so you want to actually imagine. "Okay, the… the umm… you can feel the plane shaking, you can feel the plane going down, and the pilot says that you've… that you've lost the engine, that the engine is… is malfunctioning, and you're going down, and you're terrified. You know you only have seconds to live." It may be necessary to do that if the person still fears that event. They're thinking it in their mind anyway. You may want to bring it. You're gonna bring it up. Another thing we can do is exposure to the… the fear that's in their head. Okay. So, finding out what is that real fear is important before doing that. So someone might say, "Well, you know, my biggest fear about the grocery store is just that I'll have a panic attack in the grocery store." But you know what, I'm really… "You know, what are you afraid is gonna happen if you have a panic attack?" "Hmm… Well, you know what, I think I'm more afraid that I'm going to faint. Umm… And you what, I'm even more afraid that I'll faint and someone will see me, and I'll get embarrassed." Or maybe a person is afraid they're going to faint while they're alone. And they will get hurt and they won't be able to get medical attention. So maybe, you know, they're aware that, umm… that there's nothing in and of itself that's bad about someone seeing them faint, they're afraid of inconveniencing someone, there are afraid of what someone will think of them, they're afraid of feeling embarrassed. They're afraid that they… that the person won't like them or respect them and that it'll change their life for the worse in some way. You know, so some people may be more afraid that they're gonna… they're gonna faint at work and lose the respect of their colleagues. So, we can flood the real fear. Umm… We… We may not, particularly when the real fear is something that we don't want to face, like, or that we can't face like death, like dying, fear of dying. Umm… But before we do flood that real fear, I think it's a good idea to assess for overvalued ideation. Umm… Overvalued ideation is when the person really buys into their fear. Most people have this duality, if you will. "Well, I know I'm not gonna have a heart attack, but I'm afraid that the doctors missed something." "Well, I know I'm not gonna faint, but I'm still afraid that I will." Umm… And whereas other people say, you know, "I… I… I really believe there's something wrong with my heart. I'm just convinced that the doctors missed something. And I only came to you out of desperation because nothing else is helping, but I really don't think these are panic attacks. I really believe that there is something wrong with my heart. Maybe, I am having panic attacks, but I really believe there's something wrong with my heart." You may not want to do this particular strategy with those people, umm… if they really are buying into it. Otherwise, you just have them repeat. "I'm afraid I'm gonna faint. What if I faint at work and some… and people see me faint? I'll be embarrassed. I'll feel uncomfortable around those people. What if they don't respect me anymore? I'm afraid that I'm going to faint to work. And what if I do faint at work? What if people see me? And then I'll be embarrassed, and I won't want to go back to work, and those people will think negatively of me." And you want to get a SUDS rating, umm… in a minute or… or even less than a minute. And don't allow the person to reassure themselves because then they're negatively reinforcing. But sometimes, they'll say something that may sound negatively reinforcing, but it's actually that the… that this… the flooding has worked. So for instance, they might say, "I'm afraid I'm gonna have a heart attack. What if I have a heart attack? What if there really is something wrong with my heart? What if the doctors missed something and there is something wrong with my heart? I know there's nothing wrong with my heart." That they… That they have that aha, where they now feel the same as their wise mind. They now feel that there's not gonna be a problem with their heart. And by the way, I've seen more rapid reductions with this kind of exposure than any other exposure, and sometimes it can have a profound effect just within a few minutes. In fact, sometimes when people just say it out loud or they hear you say it out loud, they say, "Wow, sounds so ridiculous when I hear you say it." And we want to consider using a mirror. When we have people look at themselves in the mirror and repeat this fear over and over again, it somehow accentuates that fear, makes that fear seem more real, and can help with the procedure. So in addition to flooding the real fear, we can flood a word or a short phrase. Steven Hayes uses the word milk. Saying the word milk repeatedly for 45 seconds and it starts to sound, not only is there an exposure benefit, but that it starts to sound nonsensical. So, I'd like for you to go ahead and try this with heart attack. And say heart attack as fast as you can repeatedly with me. Heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack… keep saying it if you're not… heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, So in addition to getting that… that, umm… the exposure, it starts to sound, sound like nonsense. Or it starts to sound like hard attack. What those guys who have a… an unusual response to Viagra, they have a hard attack. Another thing that I'll do is have people sing it, sing what they are afraid of. I believe it then, it's processed in both sides of the brain. So, if it's processed on the… the verbal side of the brain, usually the left side and on the visual, spatial, experiential side, the right side. And we can… we can accomplish that by singing. Umm… One example of that, recently, is a guy who only 22 or 23-years-old, was afraid that he was gonna die an untimely death. And it was February, but he chose Jingle Bells. So we did "Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die. Death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death…" And it also helped him to… to laugh about it as well. Umm… And we do have the option of… of questions. And anybody have any questions so far, because that ends the exposure part. And I find that a lot of times people have questions about exposure. So, if you have any questions about exposure, go ahead and send them in to Bart here. Umm… So, umm… So in the next part, I'd like to begin by talking about the nature of thoughts, the white bear research. The white bear research, we show people a picture of a white bear and tell people, "Don't think about the white bear." Then you show another group of people a picture of a white bear and tell them to think about the white bear. A few minutes later, when people use a stream of consciousness and say what's coming to their mind, the people who were told not to think about the white bear are significantly more likely to be thinking about the white bear. He did a repeat of this study where he looked at, uh… worries. And if people are told to, "So you worry about money. Don't think about money." Or "Oh, well, you worry about money," told not to think about money. That difference is even greater than we see with the white bear. So we know that we can't not think of something. And this cartoon highlights that. This guy that's in a body cast and his so-called friend comes in and says, "Man, Bernie, you're a mess. You ain't itching anywhere, are you? Man, I had a cast on my legs years ago. And boy it did itch, drove me crazy. You know what I'm saying? Because you can't scratch it, you know. So don't think about itching anywhere, Bernie, because it'll drive you nuts." So that kind of accentuates. When we try to not think of something, we're gonna think about it all the more. And Steven Hayes talks about this in his book "Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life." And in it he says, "If you don't want it, you will." And it reads, the section on that reads something like that, "I suppose if you're experiencing anxiety and you're thinking, if I don't want anxiety, I will have anxiety. Well, then the reverse must be true. That if I'm willing to have anxiety, I won't have anxiety. Well, if I'm willing to have anxiety means that I won't have anxiety, well, then I'm willing to having anxiety. But if the only reason you're willing to have anxiety is to not have anxiety, then you're not truly willing to have anxiety and it won't work." It's like the white bear or trying to not think about itching. So, what do we do about that? What are the implications of the white bear research for treatment? Well, one way is to use process versus command, and I'll explain that here shortly. Another one is to move toward relaxation versus pushing away from anxiety and then, of course, mindful observation and mindful acceptance. So, first starting with process versus command. Umm… The old way might be the process. Let, I'm sorry, the command. Let go. Shift your attention to the sounds that you hear. Notice the surfaces beneath you. Relax. Anyone ever tell you to relax and you want to flip them off? It's because they're telling you what to do. It's a command. Commands create tension. So, if you're telling your client, relax, or they're telling themselves, relax, they're likely creating tension. So instead, we want to use process words. Letting go, gently shifting your attention to the sounds you hear, noticing the surfaces beneath you, relaxing. And I'd like for you to test this out at home or if you're at your office, and say out loud, noticing how it feels. Relax. And now, relaxing. Chill out. Chilling. Let it go. Letting go. So, very simple when you're doing relaxation patter. And similar to that, moving toward relaxation versus moving away from anxiety. Let go of your thoughts, push the thoughts out of your mind, clear your mind. Instead, moving toward relaxation, gently shifting your attention to the surfaces beneath you, noticing what you hear, visualizing your muscles softening. And then, of course, mindful acceptance, we've all heard of mindful acceptance, many of you use it in your practice. But I'd like to give you a personal history and talk about some metaphors that can help clients to get it. When I was a child, I was playing on the side of my house. And I got this… this very bad cramp, a charley horse in my calf, but I'd never had one before and I didn't know what it was. So it scared me. And I called out for my mom, "Mom! Mom! My leg's dying." So she runs out. And I was very scared. I was scared that there was something terribly wrong with my leg. But she said, "Oh, no. That's just a charley horse. They hurt, but they go away pretty fast. And that's nothing to be concerned about." So, I immediately accepted that pain in a different way. It no longer gave me anxiety. So then, I went to uh… music school. I have studied not only psychology, but also music. And I was reading a book called The Soprano on Her Head, by Eloise Ristad. And there's a chapter called Awareness Cures, Trying Fails. And she suggests that if you have a difficult passage that you keep trying to play well, but you keep messing it up, that to instead watch your mistakes. Well, it just so happened that I had a really difficult passage that I couldn't get right no matter how hard I tried. So I thought, you know, I'm gonna go give this a whirl and watch my mistakes. Played it perfectly the first time, played it perfectly repeatedly by allowing myself to make the mistake. Then I went on to Penn State. Oh, I lost my finger trap. Did you see my finger trap? Umm… It must have gotten cleared away. Umm… But a finger trap is a, umm… you've probably seen one, I'll show you a picture of one here coming up. Umm… And, umm… there's one in that, in that back messy room. Umm… So and then there's, and then I learned about bees. And then when a couple of years after I was at Penn State where Tom Borkovec presented me with the Chinese finger trap and the bees, I was seeing a client that we'll call Jane. And Jane came in. She had the worst panic attack that I have seen to date. And she was hyperventilating, she was crying. Umm… thank you. She was crying and she… It took her a while to say, "I almost didn't come because I… I can't talk." And I was reading this book, "Going to Pieces without Falling Apart. And I said something like this because I hadn't really used acceptance quite in this way but, and Epstein doesn't talk specifically about how to treat panic attacks or anxiety. I just kind of borrowed from some of the things that I read and said something like this. "Well, I'm not gonna ask you to do relaxation, but would you be willing to close your eyes." And with that, she did. And then I said something like this. "Observing where you feel the anxiety, noticing where it's located in your body, noticing how much space it takes up. If it increases, allowing it to increase, if it decreases, allowing it to decrease, but letting go of trying to change it and just allowing it to be there, even though you don't like it, accepting it, allowing it to be there." And it was about that long, she was grinning ear to ear. And then when I asked her to open her eyes, she verbalized it. She said, "I was trying so hard to fight it, and then you gave me the permission to feel it. And it, it lifted." So we find that using mindful acceptance, umm… sometimes people are just like Jane and they get this immediately. They immediately are able to accept it. And I find that if you, you catch them by surprise and don't talk about the metaphors first, if you can catch them while they're feeling anxious, and… and use some of this acceptance patter, they're more likely to respond. But there's three kinds of people. There are three… People like Jane who get it immediately, and then there are people who no matter how, what you do, what metaphor you show them, they're not going to get it and, umm… because they're stuck up there. "But I don't want to feel it. I don't want to accept it. I want to get rid of it." But then for others, metaphors work. And one of the best is the Chinese finger trap. The harder I try to get out of this finger trap, the more trapped I become, the more uncomfortable I am, the more tightly it squeezes me. When I accept that I'm stuck and I let go of the struggle and I no longer try to get out of it, I create a room. I reduce that grip and I make it easier for me to use my strategy to get out of it. So presenting this metaphor actually resulted in greater reductions and anxiety avoid… avoidance, anxious thinking and anxious symptoms than doing breathing retraining. But not everybody, umm… likes that metaphor. So, I present a number of metaphors. Bees, you try to swat at bees and what happens? You rile them. They're more likely to sting you. But if you accept them and you allow them to be there, they're more likely to settle and much less likely to sting you. Oops! The charley horse, umm… We can talk about the charley horse. What hurts worse, a charley horse or your anxiety, your panic? And umm… so umm… allowing that feeling in your chest much like you accept the feelings of a charley horse. Or if… if it's a woman who wears stilettos, or pretty shoes that hurt, do those shoes hurt your feet and drawing a similar analogy with their… their panic. Another good one is, particularly for people who have GI symptoms of anxiety, "Does it cause you to feel anxious when you've eaten too much, when your stomach feels distended? Think of it like that, like you've eaten too much. It's uncomfortable, but you accept that discomfort." Antagonistic siblings. Umm… My brother used to draw pictures of me and I get so mad. He'd draw pictures of witches and put my name, I get so mad. "Mom! He is doing it again." And of course, I fueled him. Now, if I had said, "Oh, that's really good. Will you draw my profile too?" It would have taken the wind right out of his sails and he, umm… would have gotten bored. Anxiety is much the same way. To illustrate that it takes just the right metaphor for some people. I had a client who I presented all of these metaphors, including the Harry Potter metaphor, umm… and she just wasn't getting it. She just couldn't get it. But she said she felt like she was on the verge of getting it and she talked to her psychiatrist. And her psychiatrist, she said to her psychiatrist, "Jen's trying to teach me this acceptance thing. And she is using the Chinese finger trap and talking about antagonistic siblings, blah, blah, blah." And her psychiatrist said, "Oh, like an undertow." And it clicked for her immediately and from that moment on, she was able to use acceptance strategies. Now, possibly my favorite and one that really resonates for Harry Potter fans, I'm not even a big Harry Potter fan, but when I saw the film, I immediately thought about acceptance and what a great metaphor this… this I'm gonna show you a… a clip from Harry Potter on The Devil's Snare.

01:19:50
JENNIFER ABEL Okay. Alright. So, umm… And well, we're gonna hang on this slide for a little bit here. Umm… I'm gonna… I'm gonna start with number five because I think number five here, umm… how to proceed with a client, I want to make sure that we get to that and talk about that. I have a decision tree, but it's… it's much too small for it to fit here. It's in my book, "Treatment Resistant Anxiety, Worry & Panic" that you can get through Passy. And it outlines a decision tree, but suffice it to say that acceptance, if acceptance works, it works in an instant. It's painless and it can just be amazing for people. If acceptance doesn't work umm… and there's out of the blue panic or there is fear of the physical symptoms, the exposure treatments work the best. But some people aren't willing to do exposure. Some therapists aren't willing to do exposure treatments and some clients aren't willing to do exposure treatments. If you're willing to do that then offer both and sometimes people say, "I want to start with this kinder and gentler, catching the anxiety early, filling out the panic attack monitoring forms, doing the detective work, using coping strategies." We didn't really talk about cognitive therapy today, but you can use… catch things early, use cognitive therapy, umm… use, umm… use diaphragmatic breathing and other types of coping strategies. And then if that doesn't work or the person is unhappy with their treatment, then you can move on to the exposure strategies and, umm… or refer to someone who does exposure if you're not willing to do exposure. And what… what I like to do is give people that choice. And if they're willing to go with the exposure strategies, then I'll… I'll go to that after acceptance. And umm… And with the exposure strategies then once I feel that the person is no longer negatively reinforcing their behaviors and they are, they've become pretty brave, and they've habituated and desensitized, then I'll say let's go into phase two and use relaxation strategies to prevent anxiety from coming on, particularly, if they have an issue with worry then helping them with… with worry. Umm… You also want to differentiate, some people have what appears to be panic, but they're not out of the blue panic attacks. They're… And they're… They don't meet criteria for panic, they may even be situational. But remember, for it to be a panic attack, there has to be that surge. And with that surge of panic, there's usually fear of physical symptoms. So in contrast to that, people may worry their way into a panic state without that surge we definitely want to treat that more with the catching it early, nipping it at the bud, and catching more like worry. I have a similar nine best worry strategies that talks about nipping it in the bud and using strategies, or some overlap, but a lot that's different. Umm… So then using cognitive therapy, but being careful about cognitive therapy being reassurance. The way that I like to think of it is if cognitive therapy works, if these better, but believable therapy… thoughts work and it calms the person then it's cognitive therapy. But if they're having to repeat it and start ping-ponging or you're feeling a need to repeat it, it's probably reassurance and in the long run, it's negatively reinforcing and not helping. Education is a little bit different thing. Education is explaining. Well, fluorescent lights can cause a change in your brain and cause you to feel derealism… derealize. Some people have that response, some people don't. But it's actually a very common response. And I'll share with people that I get that response when I'm under fluorescent lights, I feel derealized. Another example of education is that, uh… panic is a sympathetic nervous system response. And in the autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic response, when that's activated, the parasympathetic nervous system is deactivated and a parasympathetic response is what's responsible for fainting. So, when you're having a panic attack, you're actually much less likely to faint than when you're not having a panic attack. So, you're not gonna faint when you're having a panic attack, unless the person has that idiosyncratic parasympathetic response that we see with blood and needle phobia. Blood and needle phobia, we do see that parasympathetic fainting response. It's a way of actually protecting the body from bleeding out where the body temperature is reduced which is why we sweat and there's often nausea and diarrhea, and a feeling of being faint because the blood is rushing… rushing to the core and out of the brain and then out of the arms and legs to protect the person from bleeding out. I think I already covered ruling out medical issues. But I do want to talk a little bit about dehydration, cannabis use, low blood sugar, caffeine and exercise. Umm… When people start to get panic attacks, they may avoid exercise. That's negatively reinforcing and that's one of the first things you want to get them to do because in addition to it being negatively reinforcing, they're losing that physiological benefit of increasing serotonin and norepinephrine that can prevent the anxiety. Okay. People also often have their first panic attack, 10% of first panic attacks are associated with cannabis use. And I'm not sure of any statistics, but in my experience, we can double that with hangovers, that when people get a hangover and they get dehydrated from a hangover, umm… they often have these symptoms of panic that scare them. And then they become, then… once people have this panic, they become sensitized to things that they weren't noticing before. It's kind of like that itch thing. They weren't noticing that they felt derealized at the grocery store, they accepted it, but they'd notice it now. And looking at this low blood sugar, dehydration, caffeine use, umm… this often can explain the person's first panic attack. Okay. So, for instance, one guy that I saw had been traveling with his friends. He got drunk the night before. The morning up, he went for a run and then he got on an airplane with a big puffy coat, so it got really hot. And he had a triple, triple dehydration. And then when he experienced the symptoms of dehydration, it scared him and he panicked. So, it's often helpful for people to understand what their first panic was because otherwise, they might be convinced that they have a medical issue. and if you can unravel and figure out why they had that first panic, then they're… they're more likely to understand that they're really having panic attacks and there's absolutely nothing wrong with them physiologically. And you've given them a physical explanation as well, physical explanation for why these happened. Umm… And caffeine, I'll just add there that we can use caffeine and exercise as exposure, as kind of an interoceptive exposure type of exercise. But I wouldn't recommend purposefully having people, umm… get dehydrated, or have low blood sugar, or get really bombed so that they… they get, they have a hangover. I wouldn't recommend that, umm… or smoking too much pot so that they can get exposed to those symptoms. Okay. Well, thank you very much for tuning in. Umm… I appreciate it. Have a great rest of your day.
