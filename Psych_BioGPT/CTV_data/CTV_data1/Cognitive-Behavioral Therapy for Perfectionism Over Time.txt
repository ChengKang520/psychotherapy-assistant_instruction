00:01:10
AMY I always have to like have other people see me as being perfect and good and… 

00:01:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:01:15
AMY All those kinds of things. So even if I need to get school work done, if he's sitting down watching TV, I can't concentrate on my school work until the house is picked up. So if he's not gonna do it, I'll go and do it. So now we're doing it by size. So I'm not really changing the behavior. He's like, if she is sick, if she does have a problem, he's like, we… we need to catch it now. 

00:01:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:01:35
AMY Like, I knew the reason why I was having an attack. There's all these things going on. 

00:01:40
MARTIN ANTONY And you asked me, am I being too perfectionistic here and he's actually trying to be less of a perfectionist with your kids and that's really good.

JON CARLSON Hi. I'm Jon Carlson. I'd like to welcome you to the APA Psychotherapy Series. This series is on psychotherapy over time. And this program is on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT for perfection over time. Our expert is Dr. Martin Antony. Welcome, Marty. 

00:02:20
MARTIN ANTONY Thank you. 

00:02:25
JON CARLSON Just what is CBT from your point of view? 

00:02:25
MARTIN ANTONY Uh… Cognitive behavioral therapy is uh… psychotherapy that includes really elements from both cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy. So umm… from a cognitive perspective, uh… what we do is try to help people to uh… first of all to recognize their thoughts, particularly their thoughts that are contributing to uh… problems that they're having like anxiety or depression or perfectionism in the case of this uh… this series. Umm… And to begin to shift their thinking from uh… negative style of thinking to a more realistic style of thinking. Uh… 

00:03:00
JON CARLSON Where does the behavioral part come in? 

00:03:00
MARTIN ANTONY The behavioral piece involves uh… having people change their behavior, so dysfunctional behavior. So for example, if somebody is avoiding situations that they fear, we would have them begin to confront those situations that they fear. And they two feed one another because by beginning to confront situations that people fear, they also discover that their thoughts aren't true. Umm… So behavior, changing behavior can lead to changes in thoughts. 

00:03:25
JON CARLSON Now, this program is on perfectionism. Is perfectionism a diagnostic category, when, what is it? 

00:03:35
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… Well, the way I think of a perfectionism is more as a personality trait or a behavioral style really that impacts upon a lot of different diagnostic categories. So there's evidence for example that people who are depressed umm… have higher levels of perfectionism. They tend to uh… By perfectionism I mean uh… they tend to have very high standards, uh… impossibly high standards and that the standards are very rigid. You know, a lot of us may set sort of goals or standards but if we… we don't meet those, we may adjust our standards a little bit. People with a lot of uh… dysfunctional perfectionism have difficulty shifting their standards or… or uh… goals for themselves and as a result can be very depressed or anxious. Umm… And perfectionism again not just depression but also can affect eating disorders and… and anxiety problems. 

00:04:25
JON CARLSON So it's seldom is a stand alone area, that use, there's a lot of… 

00:04:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah… yeah, usually, uh… affects uh… behavior in a lot of different ways and… and for some people maybe very focused uh… may, you know, you can think of an eating disorder is really a problem of perfectionism where people have to have the perfect body type uh… for example. 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON Now is CBT an approach that works particularly well for treating problems of perfection? 

00:04:45
MARTIN ANTONY Well, clinically or anecdotally, we've, you know, known for a long time that CBT uh… can impact upon perfectionism. There's certainly lots of data showing that CBT impacts on the problems that are associated with perfectionism, like obsessive compulsive disorder, uh… depression, umm… and so on. In the last year though, there have been three studies, one in Canada, one in the U.K. and one in Australia, that specifically have looked at the effects of CBT on perfectionism as a… as a trait uh… and have shown significant reductions in perfectionism as a result of these types of strategies. 

00:05:25
JON CARLSON Now, just exactly how does this work? What are the steps or stages that you'd follow if somebody presents with the problem of perfection? 

00:05:30
MARTIN ANTONY Well, usually uh… we would begin with uh… very thorough assessment, trying to figure out the umm… sort of boundaries of the perfectionism and also trying to distinguish between perfectionistic behaviors that are helpful because they help the person to succeed and… and ones that are maybe getting in the way of causing problems for the person. 

00:05:50
JON CARLSON I guess you want your neurosurgeon to be perfectionist? Yeah. 

00:05:50
MARTIN ANTONY Absolutely, yeah… yeah. So some perfectionism is good, so we want to really try to figure out which… which behaviors are a problem. Umm… Another piece of the early treatment is uh… helping people to recognize, or helping people to understand the cognitive behavior model and how to think of their perfectionism in terms of their thoughts and their behaviors and how those influence their… their feelings ultimately. People come for treatment umm… because their perfectionism is causing problems for them. It's affecting their relationships, it's making them feel anxious and depressed and so on. So it's… 

00:06:25
JON CARLSON So would there be like a, like an assessment phase or… 

00:06:30
MARTIN ANTONY Absolutely, yeah. So it's been usually a session or two uh… doing very thorough assessment, trying to identify what the target behaviors are, what thoughts we're going to work on during the treatment and trying to anticipate any obstacles in the environment that may get in the way. So for example uh… there maybe relationship issues, that may act upon treatment or there maybe domains in the person's life, where they are very reinforced for being a perfectionist and uh… it maybe scary for them to give up some of that perfectionism because they may worry about, you know, some of that uh… some of the rewards that come along with the perfectionism. 

00:07:05
JON CARLSON That's sort of where the behavior comes in, where you look at the reward structure? 

00:07:10
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, that would be another important piece of the behavioral, looking at things from behavioral perceptiveness. 

00:07:15
JON CARLSON And when you work with perfection or work with other problems with CBT, are there strategies or techniques that you call on? Can you highlight a few of those? 

00:07:20
MARTIN ANTONY Sure, yes. So one of them is… is cognitive therapy. So uh… what we do with cognitive therapy is, have people uh… begin to become more aware of their negative thinking patterns and to begin to challenge those by looking at the evidence uh… for and against those… those thoughts. I'll have people use thought records where they record their… their thoughts. Umm… We'll have them do little experiments where they test out whether a particular thought is uh… is useful. And then for a behavioral perspective with perfectionism, what we do is we have people start to break the rules basically. Start to do things imperfectly and… and see what happens. And, you know, if you choose the right exercises people will end up learning that nothing happens. Umm… They… they, that anxiety will actually comes down. They learn to tolerate the uh… the imperfections. 

00:08:10
JON CARLSON So that would be like uh… I don't know, be the first one up for rather than five mornings a week is something longer, rather than seven, I suppose? 

00:08:20
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, or yeah, it could be folding the towels incorrectly, it could be mispronouncing a word, it could be going out without your hair perfect or going out in sweat pants if you believe that you always have to be dressed in a certain way umm… 

00:08:35
JON CARLSON You know, so those are the thoughts in the ways you deal with behavior. Isn't there also an education component with your work? 

00:08:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, absolutely. So at the beginning… Usually, that would be more at the beginning of the treatment, although but we would continue throughout the treatment as well. Umm… Providing people with a uh… a really detailed model for understanding their perfectionism from a cognitive behavioral perspective and uh… really trying to apply the model to their own symptoms. Uh… And, you know, the basic model is that it's… it's people's beliefs and… and behaviors that contribute to their anxiety and depression and… and discomfort and… 

00:09:10
JON CARLSON And you changed the beliefs through psychoeducation, through some of the work with their… their thoughts… 

00:09:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yep, through uh… 

00:09:15
JON CARLSON …and behavior? 

00:09:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Absolutely, yeah. All… all three uh… I think are very important for changing thoughts. 

00:09:25
JON CARLSON So we're gonna uh… be involved within this program is to watch you work with uh… a young woman uh… who's name is Amy and she has problems of perfectionism is what she presented with. And we're gonna watch you work with her over six sessions which took place over approximately three month period of time. Can you set that up for our viewers about what they should look for in our opening session with Amy? 

00:09:55
MARTIN ANTONY Yep. Umm… Couple of things to look for in the opening session. I think the… the goal for the first session is to really get a good sense of the uh… perfectionism and the different uh… facets of it. Umm… This is my first meeting with her. I had… had a brief maybe a ten minute phone call with her just to… to learn a little bit about uh… what's going on. But this is really be the… the main uh… my first sort of significant exposure to her. So umm… we should look for uh… here the types of questions that I ask to… to assess the types of thoughts that she has, the beliefs that she has uh… around situations where she's perfectionist, the way she responds to those thoughts or behaviors in the situation. The impact of the perfectionism on her family and umm… and uh… relationships and… and just on her life in general would be the main things that I'm looking at. 

00:10:45
JON CARLSON So… so really assessment is what you're going on and you do this through questioning and you're gonna try this to understand the breadth of the problem? 

00:10:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yep and we also begin with some of the psycho education as well in the session, yeah. So beginning to uh… help her to think about her perfectionism in a way. 

00:11:00
JON CARLSON Well, let's begin with uh… our journey on CBT with perfection. 

00:11:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:11:10
JON CARLSON This is session number one of CBT for problems of perfectionism. 

00:11:20
Session 1 

00:11:25
MARTIN ANTONY Thanks for coming in, Amy. Umm… What I'd like to do today is to ask you some questions about some of the… the kinds of problems that you've been having, to try to, get… get a sense of that and also to talk uh… a little bit about how we're gonna help you to change things over the next uh… few meetings that we're gonna have together. Umm… So maybe to begin, I'll just ask you in… in general what kinds of problems have brought you in here? 

00:11:50
AMY Umm… Well, I tend to uh… take on a lot of things that ,you know, not every… Well, I don't know if everyone could handle them but I tend to like overload my plate and then I have to… If I'm not successful at them, then I'm really hard on myself. I have to… I value a lot of what I do on my success on it and I think that other people tend to look at me as, you know, being good at everything and I always have to like have other people see me as being perfect and good and all those kinds of things. 

00:12:25
MARTIN ANTONY So uh… perfectionist to some extent? 

00:12:30
AMY Yeah. 

00:12:30
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. And… and for umm… So you need to do things perfectly so that other people see you as perfect. Umm… Is it all driven by what other people might think or is it part of it also more of an internal need to… to do things perfectly, even if nobody is ever gonna see it or find out? 

00:12:45
AMY Yeah. A lot of it is internal and a lot of it is, I know is how I think other people view me, not necessarily, really how they would view it, you know. 

00:12:50
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:12:55
AMY Like I view my friends that don't take on the entire world or are not super successful, I don't look down on them or anything like that but I always want to be, you know, everyone say, "Oh, Amy, is so great at this and Amy can do that and…" 

00:13:05
MARTIN ANTONY So umm… your high standards are really just for yourself, it's… it's not so much for other people. Umm… Is there… Is there anyone in your life where you tend to set those high standards either for your… your children or your husband or… It's important that your husband looks perfect to other people? 

00:13:25
AMY No. 

00:13:25
MARTIN ANTONY No? Okay. 

00:13:25
AMY No. I mean, my… my… and my children are young. They are three and 18 months. So I don't know how much of that I will probably push on to them. Although, whenever they are successful or anything, I tend to brag about quite a bit. 

00:13:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:13:40
AMY But I wonder if that's just being a parent or me wanting everybody to think how great they are too. 

00:13:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:13:40
AMY You know… 

00:13:45
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… But most it feels like it's directed inward that you… you have to do things perfectly. Umm… So what… what sorts of things do you have to do perfectly? 

00:13:55
AMY Umm… I don't do very well or I don't accept it very well if I don't get good grades. 

00:13:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:14:00
AMY Umm… You know, I… I've always been pretty close to a stray student and I know that grades aren't everything but to me that kind of validates how well I… I can do things. Umm… 

00:14:10
MARTIN ANTONY You pretty much have to get an A on every… 

00:14:15
AMY Yeah, I have a hard time if I, if I don't achieve an A. Umm… And then even when I do get an A, it's like, if I see the person next to me having like a little bit higher than A, then I get really duck, they are like hard on myself and I have to study even more the next time or, I have to make sure that paper is written a little bit better the next time. 

00:14:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yes. And do you need to have the highest in the class to feel okay about it? 

00:14:35
AMY Umm… If I know that I'm, that there's people that are higher than me like, then it does, it can bother me. Umm… But like in my one statistics class when I found out that I set the curve on every single tests, that was great for me. And when I didn't on one of the tests, I had a really hard work. 

00:14:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:14:55
AMY You know. 

00:14:55
MARTIN ANTONY What if you found out you got the second highest grade in, on a test, will that be a good news or bad news? 

00:15:00
AMY Bad. 

00:15:00
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Okay. Okay, so school is certainly one area where the standards are very high umm… what else? 

00:15:15
AMY Umm… What I can do umm… like with my kids, you know, like I'm always trying to do funny things with Omen, do it constantly like I always have to be busy doing something. Like… like if me and my family are kind of sitting at home relaxing that we should be doing something, whether it's something social or something physical or something, you know. 

00:15:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, you seem to be busy all the time? 

00:15:35
AMY Yeah. 

00:15:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. And in terms of your kids, do you need to be the perfect parent with your kids? 

00:15:40
AMY Yeah. 

00:15:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. And, and how, how would umm… people who know you, how would they… What kinds of perfectionistic behaviors around your kids would they notice? 

00:15:50
AMY Umm… Well, I always have to be like the fun parent. Umm… You know I… I tend to thrive on knowing that like I do things with my kids that I know some of my friends don't do with theirs. Umm… 

00:16:05
MARTIN ANTONY Can you give me an example? 

00:16:05
AMY Umm… For example my… my daughter just got an easy bake oven and so one day we made, you know, we're… I was showing her how to bake with that and every single Friday, every single Friday my older daughter who is three, her and I bake something, whether it's in her easy bake oven or, you know, like an actual cake or something, you know. And, you know, that's something that her and I always do together every single Friday and… 

00:16:25
MARTIN ANTONY And if you couldn't do that for some reason, would it be very upsetting to you? 

00:16:35
AMY Umm… No, as long as we are like, it wasn't done because of something on my terms. 

00:16:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:16:40
AMY You know, like if something came up and I realized that I couldn't do it, that's fine, but if… I don't know. 

00:16:45
MARTIN ANTONY Can you give me an example of something where it wouldn't be fine? 

00:16:50
AMY Umm… I can't… I can't think of anything actually. 

00:16:50
MARTIN ANTONY If you're just too tired one day and… 

00:16:55
AMY I'll still do it. 

00:16:55
MARTIN ANTONY You still do it? 

00:16:55
AMY Yeah. 

00:16:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So you would not do it because of how you're feeling? 

00:16:55
AMY Right. 

00:17:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Okay. What if uh… if she didn't want to do it one week? 

00:17:10
AMY Umm… She's… she's tried to like… Well, I don't know because she's always pretty excited about it but there was one time where she was just like no, no… no and I kind of try to push her to it, you know. And then instead of doing that, we did like an arts and crafts project instead. 

00:17:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:17:25
AMY So… 

00:17:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. What other areas of your life do you feel like the… the perfectionism affects? 

00:17:30
AMY Umm… Probably like marriage. You know, I… I work part-time and I go to school part-time and then I have two kids. And so, you know, I also want to be, make sure that, like I can cook for my husband and I always… The house always has to be very organized. Umm… So like when my husband gets home from work, I always want the house to be very clean, ,you know, dinner is cooking. And believing that, it's not a standard that he puts on me at all. 

00:17:55
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

00:17:55
AMY So umm… 

00:17:55
MARTIN ANTONY So house has to be perfect and the uh… umm… you're working as well? What kind of work do you do? 

00:18:05
AMY I'm a recreational therapist, so… 

00:18:10
MARTIN ANTONY And you uh… Would people at work describe you as a perfectionist around your work? 

00:18:10
AMY Umm… Probably. 

00:18:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. So do you… How does that affect your work? 

00:18:15
AMY Umm… I don't know. I always tend to look at… And this is probably where, you know, some thing is faulty in my head that, you know, I just think of being perfect at work is a good thing. You know, I strive to umm… do better things for my patients. I come up with different programming and… and put my different projects and stuff for my patients to you know, excel with and, you know… So I just, you know, I don't see why perfectionism is a problem. Right. 

00:18:40
MARTIN ANTONY So when you say something is wrong with your head because you want to do that, what do you mean by that? 

00:18:45
AMY Because not everybody feels it they have to be perfect. So I… Do I feel like I have to be, that's what I mean by like, you know, there's something wrong? 

00:18:55
MARTIN ANTONY So how do you know I've met some people who would say that… that means as a problem with everybody else, that they are not living up to that important standard? 

00:19:00
AMY Umm… I don't know. 

00:19:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you feel like it's excessive with you or that you… 

00:19:05
AMY Umm… Yeah, because I mean I have some friends who are really good at what they do and they take on a lot but like I just feel like, I don't know. 

00:19:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, so for you it feels much more important. 

00:19:15
AMY Yeah. 

00:19:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… There are other domains of your life where, where uh… this is an issue? 

00:19:25
AMY Umm… 

00:19:30
MARTIN ANTONY So we've talked about work, we've talked about home uh… with your kids, we talked about in terms of your marriage and cleaning and umm… housework, cooking. We talked about your… your job. 

00:19:45
AMY Umm… Just in general umm… I tend to be very organized. Umm… uh… I uh… I make a schedule of the entire year for all the weekends. Like, come January 1, I have like a little spreadsheet of every weekend for the entire year and umm… it's all typed up and I have all my plans on it for the whole year and umm… I do that like with my weekly schedules and I have to, you know, type up my grocery list and you know, I type up my to do list and umm… you know, organization is a big thing for me. So I feel like it's, I don't know, it keeps me on track. 

00:20:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. How much time do you spent organizing? 

00:20:25
AMY Probably way too much. 

00:20:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, so on a typical day… 

00:20:25
AMY Umm… I don't know, I'm on that computer quite a bit, you know, making sure that like, you know, my plans are all set in order and my little spreadsheets or whatever and I know one thing that… 

00:20:40
MARTIN ANTONY How long is your to-do-list? How many pages? 

00:20:40
AMY Umm… Actually it's not pages. 

00:20:40
MARTIN ANTONY It's not pages. 

00:20:40
AMY Hmm-mm. 

00:20:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Do you want to-do-list though? 

00:20:45
AMY Yeah. 

00:20:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. How many lists you have? 

00:20:45
AMY Well, I have my school list and my work list and so I guess it is would be pages but… 

00:20:50
MARTIN ANTONY So it's like a home list or school list… 

00:20:55
AMY Yeah, it's in categories. 

00:20:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… And everything is typed? 

00:20:55
AMY Yeah. 

00:20:55
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:21:00
AMY I mean, I… Like, I made a schedule for me and my husband and he just laughs about it but, you know, we're… You know, I put in like what I have to do, like basically during every hour of the day, for the whole week like uh… you know, I call AWS like Average Weekly Schedule, you know. Like when I'm gonna be in classes, when umm… I'll be at work, you know, it takes me 45 minutes to drive to class. So, you know, when I'll on the road and those kinds of things. 

00:21:25
MARTIN ANTONY And you give him the copy of the list? 

00:21:25
AMY Yeah. I also do it for him too. 

00:21:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Oh, you… I'm sorry, list of what he's doing or…? 

00:21:30
AMY Oh, yeah, him and me, Like in separate little things. Umm… Because then I can make sure that I get my housework done and like I get the laundry done and all those kinds of things too, so… 

00:21:40
MARTIN ANTONY It's a color coded? 

00:21:45
AMY Umm… No, because I don't know he's having a color printer. 

00:21:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:21:50
AMY So… But I have, like, I have binders where I keep everything into umm… like grooming the house hunting, I typed everything up and put in a binder and… 

00:22:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… And uh… it's just a planning all of your weekends, what kinds of things in January, so for example, you've now planned the whole year, all of your weekends, what you're gonna be doing. What sorts of things do you have coming up in June and August and November? 

00:22:20
AMY Well, June my mother-in-law is graduating from grad school in Minnesota, so we are gonna go there for a weekend and do that. Also my father is retiring, so that's another weekend. I'm planning his retirement party. Umm… And then I think we have a weekend that we're going to my father-in-law's to go swimming because he lives on a beach. And then I think there might be one weekend in June that's open. 

00:22:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:22:40
AMY So… 

00:22:45
MARTIN ANTONY And that will be filled as soon as… 

00:22:45
AMY Whenever I can fill it. As soon as I can fill it. 

00:22:50
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… And… and what about in October? 

00:22:55
AMY Umm… I'm trying to think of my October schedule. 

00:22:55
MARTIN ANTONY It doesn't have to be October, November, September. 

00:23:00
AMY November, well, the first weekend is my birthday, so we have plans for that weekend. Umm… We also go up to Michigan for Thanksgiving and we'll be going to Iowa to visit my husband's grandparents, their grandmother. 

00:23:15
MARTIN ANTONY So a lot of these are trips. Do you… do you go away most weekends? 

00:23:15
AMY No. 

00:23:15
MARTIN ANTONY No. 

00:23:15
AMY Like this past weekend, you know, we had a… we had a play date with about 15 families at a friend's house. So that was on there. 

00:23:25
MARTIN ANTONY And who organized that? 

00:23:25
AMY Umm… Me and another, morning together moms. 

00:23:30
MARTIN ANTONY Do you… Do you organize most of the things that… that happened? 

00:23:30
AMY Yeah. 

00:23:30
MARTIN ANTONY On the weekends, yeah. 

00:23:35
AMY Yeah, like I planned a trip for about 15 or 20 families, we all go to the Dallas together. 

00:23:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:23:40
AMY So, you know, I arranged for everybody's hotel rooms and figured out carpooling transport, transportation and stuff like that so… 

00:23:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… In terms of perfectionism uh… does it affect uh… your umm… sort of uh… physical appearance or body image issues or… 

00:23:55
AMY Umm… 

00:24:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you need to look a certain way? 

00:24:00
AMY Yeah. Well, obviously looking how I am now, no, but I do have a mid-term later so that's why I'm in comfortable clothes. Umm… And I know, like, I don't, another type of a person who always has to make a bond or has to have their hair done, none of part of that because of maybe I'm busy with the kids, I can't really justify for drawing my hair for 45 minutes when I could be doing something with them. Umm… But umm… I do tend to compare myself to my friends who are very thin. And I have problems with that just for the fact that, this is the largest I've ever been in my entire life. You know, it's very hard for me to accept. So umm… and I do deal with it negatively. There are some behaviors that I know I've, you know, adopted that are very unhealthy. 

00:24:45
MARTIN ANTONY What kinds of things? 

00:24:45
AMY Umm… I tend to make myself throw up. So… 

00:24:50
MARTIN ANTONY How often does that happen? 

00:24:50
AMY Umm… At least once a day. 

00:24:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… Is there anything else that you do to uh… Have some tissues here… 

00:25:00
AMY Thanks. 

00:25:00
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… Is there anything else that you do uh… to control weight? 

00:25:05
AMY Umm… Not that I can think of. Like I don't use laxatives, I don't, not eat those kinds of things. 

00:25:10
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, you eat normally what most people do? 

00:25:15
AMY Yeah, like I'll eat like a normal meal. You know, like I'll eat, like a sandwich for lunch and then go and get rid of it. 

00:25:20
MARTIN ANTONY Any… any binge eating sort of eating a large amount in a short period of time? 

00:25:25
AMY No. 

00:25:25
MARTIN ANTONY Excessive exercising? 

00:25:30
AMY Umm… I used to. I've kind of calm down with it just because the kids but umm… I used to run anywhere between two and six miles everyday. Umm… 

00:25:40
MARTIN ANTONY How about… How about currently? 

00:25:40
AMY So now usually I run like three times a week. 

00:25:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:25:45
AMY And only two miles. 

00:25:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… How much time do you spend in a typical day thinking about your weight? Is it a… a big focus or… 

00:25:50
AMY Umm… If I pass by a mirror, you know, or if I see someone thin, you know, that's when I tend to fixate on it. 

00:26:00
MARTIN ANTONY And how long do you spend thinking about it? 

00:26:05
AMY Umm… I don't know. Probably too long. I can't think of like an actual time frame but… 

00:26:10
MARTIN ANTONY Would you say minutes or hours? 

00:26:10
AMY Probably just minutes. 

00:26:10
MARTIN ANTONY Minutes per day? 

00:26:10
AMY Yeah. Oh, per day? Probably more than that. But like at the time like if, you know, somebody very thin was sitting next to me, you know, I'll be thinking about it for quite a while. I'm sitting next to him and try to focus on something else to get my mind off the fact that she's thin. 

00:26:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So may… Each time it comes up, it might last a few minutes or something and it might come up a few times a day? 

00:26:30
AMY Yeah. 

00:26:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… What about any other aspects of your physical appearance, that… that don't feel quite right to you other than your weight? 

00:26:45
AMY No. Are you trying to tell me something? I'm scared. 

00:26:45
MARTIN ANTONY No. No, I'm just… Sometimes when people have a lot of perfectionistic beliefs, there maybe some body part that they're focused on. So a guy might be focused on his hair or think my nose is too big or it's not symmetrical or things like that, it's just nothing like that? 

00:27:00
AMY No, usually just weight things. 

00:27:05
MARTIN ANTONY Just weight focused, okay. Umm… Okay. So it seems like the… the perfectionism is a lot of different areas in your life and I'm also hearing from you that, that umm… there's aspects of you that you really like, I mean, it makes you do good job at work for example. Umm… Why would you want to change it? 

00:27:25
AMY Umm… I don't want my kids to think that I have too high expectations on them. I think my main worry is how it will affect my kids. 

00:27:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:27:35
AMY Umm… And part of that is how organized I am and how I can't stand clutter or chaos in like my house. Umm… Like if my kids are playing with something and they like move like five feet closer, I'm right behind them putting everything back in order where it should be, should go. You know, like all their toys have a specific spot and umm… like I noticed a few weeks ago my umm… brother from California was visiting and umm… he helped clean up all the toys and he put, they have all these little people toys and he put them all in one bin and my little, my three year old went in there and she's like, no uncle Brian, you did this wrong. The animals don't go in this bin. Animals go in this bin and people go in this bin and it kind of hit me that, you know, am I making her feel or I don't want to put that kind of pressure on her where she feels like, she has to be perfect and if she doesn't put it in the right spot, she's wrong or she's not good enough or anything like that. So I just don't think that's a good feeling to grow up with. 

00:28:35
MARTIN ANTONY So an important motivation for you is… is really to uh… for the prospect of wanting to be a better parent and then not having some of this rub off on the child or on your children. Umm… uh… Any other reasons why you want to change? So if you didn't have children, would you say, no point changing or… 

00:28:55
AMY No, I… I think part of it too is like, it would be kind of nice just to accept me for me and like, you know, I'm not always have to sit there and feel like, I need to be better at this or you know, I'm only going to school and working and having kids. Maybe I should take on something more. What else can I get involved with that will make other people notice how great of a person I am or, you know, make someone realize that I'm really good at this or something like that, you know. I always feel like I should keep doing more and to, you know… 

00:29:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so wanting to just be more accepting of yourself would be another goal? 

00:29:30
AMY Yeah. 

00:29:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. What else would you umm… like to see different? 

00:29:35
AMY Umm… 

00:29:40
MARTIN ANTONY …about this? How will you know how that… that this therapy has worked? 

00:29:50
AMY Maybe I would be a little bit more relaxed about things. I'm extremely… I'm very fidgety umm… and umm… I tend to get irritated easily, I think. Umm… Mostly I get very extremely irritated with my best friend and that's really affected our friendship and umm… I kind of hurt her a lot, so I don't want to lose her just because I'm being a big pain in the butt, about little things. Which I'm sure that, in her eyes there are little things and they are but… 

00:30:20
MARTIN ANTONY Can you give me an example or something…? 

00:30:25
AMY Umm… One day her and her husband were coming over for dinner and umm… I realized that we didn't have something. So I called her and I said okay, where are you guys and she said, oh, we're in the parking lot of the grocery store. Oh, can you go and pick this up? And she goes, no, because we're leaving. I'm like okay and I got really crappy with her. And umm… And she could tell about it on the phone. She's like, when I get there, you know, I'll just watch the kids, so you can go out. I'm like, why are you gonna make me go out when you're right there? You know, it just… And it probably had nothing to do with the fact that she wouldn't go inside. It just… I don't know. She just, little things with her, irritate me more than anybody else in my life and I don't know why that is that she irritates me more but I just tend to like, nitpick at her and it's not fair to her. 

00:31:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:31:05
AMY And… and I don't know if it's like I expect perfection out of her and I don't get that or I… I honestly don't know what it is. I just tend to get extremely irritable with her and with my older daughter. 

00:31:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… And uh… anything else that you can imagine? What would it be like for you to have a weekend that's not filled with things? 

00:31:35
AMY Umm… I don't know. I don't have one of those in a very long time. So umm… 

00:31:40
MARTIN ANTONY Is that something that you would want to be able to uh… enjoy maybe not whole weekend but even a few hours of…? 

00:31:50
AMY Well, actually this past weekend umm… we had four different parties or activities or things that we are supposed to go to and I told my husband, like, I can't do it, I have no energy. I have to study for this test. I've got a lot of school work to do. And so my husband is like fine, I'll call everybody and cancel everything, just don't worry about it and you know, umm… it was actually very relaxing. It was nice. But I felt guilty all day for, like I felt, like I let those people down for not being there or… 

00:32:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:32:20
AMY You know… 

00:32:20
MARTIN ANTONY And uh… what was the response from them? 

00:32:25
AMY Umm… Well, one of the girls, if I was supposed to go to her house and do some stuff, you know, she's just like, oh, that's just like Awe,(ph) you know. She always plans too much stuff and she can't do it all. So that kind of made me feel shitty. Excuse my language. 

00:32:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. And… and does that umm… does that happen often where you plan too much and you have to cancel things or do you usually do all the things that you've planned? 

00:32:50
AMY Umm… We usually do everything but we tend to, I tend to plan like a lot in one day. 

00:32:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:32:55
AMY Umm… And my husband is a good sport because I know, he would rather just hang out at home. He works a lot and I know that he'd rather just come home and relax with the family and that kind of thing but, you know… 

00:33:10
MARTIN ANTONY You kind of pulling him out to do different things?. 

00:33:10
AMY Yeah. 

00:33:10
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… What uh… umm… Speaking of… of not getting time to do everything, how important is it to you uh… to be on time for things? Is that an area that's… 

00:33:25
AMY No, that's not something that I… 

00:33:25
MARTIN ANTONY That's not something that you worry about, okay. 

00:33:25
AMY No. 

00:33:25
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… 

00:33:25
AMY Which is probably good because that would probably break up our marriage. My husband is a very… very late. So… 

00:33:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So you tend to pack a lot of stuff in and if you don't get everything done in time, you just take a little bit longer to… to do things? 

00:33:40
AMY Yeah. But we still get it all done. 

00:33:40
MARTIN ANTONY But you get it all done. Umm… What do you sacrifice in order to get all the stuff done? Do you lose sleep? 

00:33:50
AMY Yeah, especially lately I've been having problems like fall asleep. Umm… I've been having really restless sleep, where I will wake up several times at night umm…. 

00:34:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you ever purposely stay up really late because you're trying to get all the stuff done that you need to get done? 

00:34:00
AMY Oh, yeah. 

00:34:00
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:34:00
AMY Like, I'll be up late tonight doing work for tomorrow, for school and stuff. 

00:34:05
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. So, how… how much… How many of hours of sleep will you gets a night? 

00:34:10
AMY Umm… Well, if my kids sleep in, which means seven. I probably get like three or four hours of sleep tonight. 

00:34:15
MARTIN ANTONY How often does that happen? 

00:34:15
AMY Umm… At least two nights, two or three nights a week, where I stay up late to get stuff done. But then I… I also try to get up in the morning and run while my husband is still home, you know. 

00:34:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… Okay and then uh… you tend to… to spend a lot of time working on things in order to get them perfect? So do you over prepare for exams? Do you study more than most people would? 

00:34:50
AMY I don't know if I study more than most people would but umm… 

00:34:55
MARTIN ANTONY There are areas of your life that you tend to over prepare? 

00:34:55
AMY But it takes me a long time to get things though. You know, like to write a paper, it takes me… What? I know my husband considers way too long because he just can whip that kind of stuff out and I tend to or go slow and reread and proofread and then go back and change a bunch of things and you know, mostly on papers. And umm… I guess my study skills are kind of odd because I rewrite all my notes. 

00:35:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:35:20
AMY Umm… And then like an outline form and so they're easier to read and… and it actually helps me to do better in test, so… But you know, it just takes an awful long time to do. 

00:35:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. And why are you rewriting to umm… 

00:35:35
AMY Because it makes it look nicer. 

00:35:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:35:40
AMY Like it's… It's just, it looks perfect. It's all in outline form, it's very organized. 

00:35:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Okay, so you're not… because there's actually, from a studying perspective it actually isn't a bad idea because it forces you to think about the material as you're rewriting it. 

00:35:55
AMY Yeah. 

00:35:55
MARTIN ANTONY And where sometimes when people are studying for exams and they're just highlighting, they are not really thinking about the material but… but that's not the reason you're doing it. Your… your motivation is to make it look nice. 

00:36:05
AMY Right. But it does help me like you said it. 

00:36:05
MARTIN ANTONY That's an added benefit. 

00:36:05
AMY Right. 

00:36:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:36:10
AMY Yeah. I have done a lot better in my tests since I've started doing that, which happened in college for my undergrad. So… 

00:36:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Okay. Umm… sometimes uh… uh… when people are… are… are sort of focused on doing things perfectly, umm… it can actually stop them from getting things done, where they put things off and procrastinate because they are afraid of failing and not doing a good job. Are there areas of your life where uh… the perfectionism actually stops you from getting things done? 

00:36:40
AMY Umm… I don't know if it stops me from getting things done, but I'm a huge procrastinator. 

00:36:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:36:45
AMY Yeah. Like I'm… Like if I have a big paper due tomorrow, I'll start it tonight. 

00:36:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:36:50
AMY You know, but then that causes me to be up until four in the morning and then I'm up again at like six or seven with my girls, so… 

00:37:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So you tend to do things at the last minute, yeah. 

00:37:05
AMY I don't know if it makes me concentrate better or what. But if I, I've tried starting things beforehand and I just… I don't know if it's that I have more time. So I just kind of relax on it and… 

00:37:15
MARTIN ANTONY There's other things you start on months in advance though, right? So planning your weekends for example is something that you… How much of the… the busy work that you do umm… when I say busy work, I'm talking about… 

00:37:30
AMY Like my schedules on my computers? 

00:37:30
MARTIN ANTONY All the schedules, and the, and the planning and the cleaning and the things that you… you feel like you have to do. How much of that is do you think a distraction from doing some of the other things at the school work things that you tend to procrastinate with? 

00:37:40
AMY Oh, it's a huge distraction. I mean, that's, you know, two hours a day that I'm sitting there and like, you know, redoing my schedules or format them in a different way, so they look different or… 

00:37:50
MARTIN ANTONY Are you doing them… Are you actually doing them though to avoid doing other things sometimes? 

00:37:55
AMY Umm… I don't know if I mean to do it for that reason but I know like, if I go home tonight and get on the computer to do my school work, you know, I will probably, you know, check my email first and then, you know, I'll do a couple of other things first, you know. I'll go do the dishes or vacuum the floor. 

00:38:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:38:15
AMY You know, I feel like, if all that's kind of stuff done around me, then I've nothing else to think about. 

00:38:20
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

00:38:20
AMY But my paper. 

00:38:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:38:20
AMY But my studying or my project. 

00:38:25
MARTIN ANTONY So you need to get all that stuff done first? 

00:38:25
AMY Yeah. 

00:38:25
MARTIN ANTONY And… and does that those… That work, does that added up to hours per day? 

00:38:30
AMY Like the… 

00:38:30
MARTIN ANTONY The organizing and the cleaning and the… Yeah. 

00:38:35
AMY Yeah. 

00:38:35
MARTIN ANTONY How many hours would you guess? And it's hard to estimate that. 

00:38:40
AMY Umm… I don't know. Umm… Like, just doing like my schedules and that kind of thing or just like, and cleaning up after everything and… 

00:38:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, and… and especially the part that… that maybe is… is more than the average person would do. I mean, everybody cleans a little bit and everybody organizes a little bit. 

00:39:00
AMY Right. Umm… Several hours. 

00:39:00
MARTIN ANTONY Several hours per day? 

00:39:00
AMY Yeah. 

00:39:05
MARTIN ANTONY So, okay. So it sounds like the umm… It's possible anyway and we don't know this for sure but it's possible that some of this behavior is… is the busy work what everyone calls it is related to, wanting to do a really good job on things and… and uh… you know to look at in front of other people and to… to feel a sort of sense of satisfaction. Part of it may also be to avoid dealing with things that are more stressful like… like school work for example. Umm… Does that sound fair? 

00:39:35
AMY Yeah. 

00:39:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Okay. Umm… Okay. Can you give me uh… an example today of something that you did that was again… 

00:39:50
AMY Busy work? 

00:39:55
MARTIN ANTONY Busy work or a perfectionistic kind of work or something you'd like to, you can imagine wanting to change umm… 

00:40:00
AMY Well, I… I was at work today umm… I only work three days a week, so today was one of the days that I was at work. Umm… And when I get all my assessments done and I did my group stuff with my patients, coming back to my office and instead of opening one of my books to study or, you know, planning the next week's you know, supply list first for work, you know, I typed up my February, March menu list. Like, what I'll make for dinner for those months, you know, because it just, I mean and it sounds so stupid but like, I always like justify every little stupid thing that I do, like all my stupid little busy work that I do. I justify it like with my menus and my goal, it makes grocery shopping easier, because I already know what I'm gonna hit. So you know, I can make my grocery list, so I made my grocery list too then instead of doing work that I was supposed to be getting paid to do, couple of things, so. 

00:40:45
MARTIN ANTONY Right, okay. 

00:40:50
AMY I have no one from my work sees this. 

00:40:50
MARTIN ANTONY So how umm… Is this all stuff that you want to change or… or not necessarily? And some of these behaviors, you like? 

00:41:00
AMY Yeah, yeah and I'll admit it. Like some of these things, you know. I… I like my schedule and that kind of stuff. Umm… But I wish, I wasn't so fixated on it. I wish it wasn't such like umm… I guess like a priority to have all these things in order, so I can function with the rest of my life. Like, I wish I could just get up in the morning and play with my kids without having a plan like I… I just feel like I have to be so organized and have everything set in such a way, I'm very based on routine. And when things don't go according to my plans, I don't deal with it really well. I tend to have anxiety attacks and I get really stressed out and that's when I get extremely irritable with people and… 

00:41:40
MARTIN ANTONY Can you tell me about a specific example where you got really anxious when things did not follow your plan? 

00:41:45
AMY Umm… Actually uh… this sounds kind of horrible but umm… it happened about a year and a half ago and umm… I thought I might be pregnant and so I told my husband that I was four days late and he went out and brought pregnancy test and I took it and he told me that it was negative and I was excited because we were not planning, I was just trying to have another one for another six months and then he looked again and it was positive and I… I, like, couldn't function for a week. 

00:42:10
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:42:15
AMY Like, I was crying all the time. I was stressed out like, it just ruined all my plans for like the next two years. 

00:42:20
MARTIN ANTONY It's not that you didn't want the baby, you just wanted it… 

00:42:20
AMY Right, I mean I wanted four or five children. You know, she's only number two but at the time, it was just… 

00:42:25
MARTIN ANTONY It wasn't, set another time? 

00:42:30
AMY Yeah. 

00:42:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:42:30
AMY So I had a very hard time dealing with that night. And I had to work on anxiety attacks or whatever and I just… 

00:42:35
MARTIN ANTONY And what were your thoughts? Why… why was that so important that it would be according to that time, if you think back? 

00:42:45
AMY I had an idea like how far apart my kids should be, you know, and then I could fit in different things that I wanted to do with in life. I could have started school a little bit earlier or umm… we could have taken our first daughter on vacations or something or I just felt like we didn't get enough time with just delaying, you know, which necessarily isn't fair. So the other kids that come along because we never have time for just that kid but… 

00:43:05
MARTIN ANTONY And what uh… and what might happen if you didn't… didn't have that extra amount of time? 

00:43:15
AMY I don't know. I just felt like it just wasn't perfect. 

00:43:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:43:20
AMY You know, I had this ideal in my head and I guess that might be what it is, is I have… These ideas in my head of how my life should be and when my life isn't that way, you know, I tend to break down emotionally or umm… those kinds of things. 

00:43:35
MARTIN ANTONY You ever question those beliefs? So you ever thought, it has to be this way? 

00:43:40
AMY Yeah, because I… I have so many friends who don't seem to behave this way or don't seem to run their life as rigidly as I feel like I am. 

00:43:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:43:50
AMY And that's what bothers me too, is like, they are okay with just living life the way it goes and going with the flow and I just can't do that. 

00:43:55
MARTIN ANTONY So if you were your own therapist, what… what would you be recommending to you? How would you change this? 

00:44:05
AMY Relax. Umm… Oh, I don't know. Umm… 

00:44:10
MARTIN ANTONY Let's say, I was your client and you're my therapist. 

00:44:15
AMY Oh, don't do that to me. 

00:44:15
MARTIN ANTONY What kinds of strategies uh… 

00:44:20
AMY Umm… I guess, I don't know. Maybe that there is a way that I can, you know, take like just to work on one aspect at a time to try to… Like, let go of some things. You know, like when… And ever since my brother was in town, my kids had to clean up all the time, you know, and I realized that they had to have their toys in a specific spot too, like I've been trying not to fell them around the house and clean up everything and put everything in its exact order, but it's really hard for me because I'll leave the room and that's all I can think about. 

00:44:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. And then what happens? 

00:45:00
AMY I go back and change it. 

00:45:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you go back and clean… clean up after them? 

00:45:00
AMY Right or like if… If we clean up and you know, and things aren't in the specific order that I normally put them in. Like their Disney princess are in a specific order. If I just throw them on top and go in the other room, just to play with something else, I'll go back and… 

00:45:15
MARTIN ANTONY Do you ever had a situation where you couldn't fix it or you decided not to fix it? 

00:45:20
AMY Nothing I can think of. Like off of the top of my head. 

00:45:25
MARTIN ANTONY So you… you always go back and fix it? 

00:45:25
AMY Yeah. 

00:45:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… We only have… just about four minutes left. So umm… I just want to talk about a couple of things and in terms of the uh… that sorts of things that you can do to change this, you actually have sort of hit on… on a few things and… and basically there's two sort of factors, I think that… that contribute to uh… the anxiety that you feel when things don't go the way you want them to go. One is your beliefs in the situation. You… you mentioned uh… a few minutes ago that umm… you believe things have to go in a certain way. You know, rationally, maybe it doesn't make sense because your friends don't believe that necessarily. 

00:46:00
AMY Right. 

00:46:05
MARTIN ANTONY Their life is fine. Umm… But you've… you've made a decision in a way that things have to go a certain way and if they don't uh… it's overwhelming. Umm… And… and the anxiety really is a response to threat. You know, we feel anxious if a bear is chasing us, we feel anxious, if uh… if we think that we're gonna be hurt in some way. Umm… For you it feels threatening when things don't go according to the schedule for example. Uh… So we're gonna want to look at those beliefs and… and see whether we can uh… begin to explore them and find out whether they're true beliefs or whether they're just beliefs umm… that… that maybe or not necessarily realist or based in… in fact. Umm… The second thing that you've kind of hit on is that, in order to change uh… the perfectionism, it maybe important to actually change some of the behaviors that you engage in. So, but you also hit on another piece of this that makes it so difficult for people to do that. And that's that, when you start changing the behaviors, you feel absolutely terrible. I mean, if it's very anxiety provoking. You can imagine, if you're afraid of dogs, that if, you know, to overcome the fear of dogs what do you? 

00:47:15
AMY Don't chase the head on type of thing. 

00:47:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, because you end up facing. And what would happen, when you feel very anxious? But it wouldn't stay that way. You know, if you can tolerate that discomfort for a period, it might be an hour or two hours, it might be all night for some things depending on… on… on what it is. Umm… The, that reaction changes over time. Umm… In fact, in one case it lasted a week. You know, there was one situation, you couldn't change and that was your privacy, right? 

00:47:40
AMY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:40
MARTIN ANTONY And uh… but even that, you know, it was very anxiety provoking but then it got better. Umm… My guess is that, you know, it's not gonna happen. But if that were to happen over and over and over again, eventually you get used to it and you take, oh, the pregnancy. 

00:47:55
AMY I don't know how will my husband want to deal with that part though. 

00:47:55
MARTIN ANTONY You already said, you want four or five or… Umm… But uh… but… but that's often what happens, you know, that… that the first time it's very, very anxiety provoking and then it just gets easier with time. So one of the things that we're gonna be talking about is changing some of the perfectionistic behaviors and breaking some of the rules and trying things differently and tolerating that discomfort. Umm… So we're gonna meet again in a couple of weeks. What I'd like to give you now, this is a book that… that I've written, it's called "When Perfect Isn't Good Enough." Umm… And it talks about uh… strategies for overcoming perfectionism essentially. 

00:48:30
AMY Okay. 

00:48:35
MARTIN ANTONY So uh… and it talks about strategies for changing thoughts and for changing behaviors. Umm… Do you have time in the next couple of weeks to do a bit of reading? Yeah, umm…, you probably, I know, you probably don't, but… 

00:48:45
AMY No, I do, I do. Yeah. One of my classes is canceled already for next week. So, yeah. 

00:48:45
MARTIN ANTONY Was it? Great. So the chapters that umm… The introductory chapters of the first four umm… and they… they sort of describe perfectionism. Umm… So I… you know, if you can, if you can start with those, they're… they're not long chapters. Umm… And then from there we will get into uh… some of the strategies for changing perfectionism which we'll sort of come after that. So… so I'll give you that and that's yours to keep. So you can write in it or whatever. 

00:49:15
AMY Thank you. Highlight. Can we write notes? 

00:49:20
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… Highlight. Yeah, rewrite it. Umm… And uh… in a couple of weeks then we'll… we'll start planning in more details, specific strategies for changing umm… some of these behaviors umm… and uh… and hopefully also bringing some fearing, I'll write it down as a result. So do you umm… do you have any questions? 

00:49:35
AMY Umm… I don't know. I'm a little over right now, so maybe I'll think of some in the next couple of weeks and come with a list. 

00:49:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. That sounds good. Umm… What I'd like you to do is over the next couple of weeks, if you could also begin to umm… pay attention to some of these perfectionistic behaviors and thoughts when they come up. So if you do have uh… an episode where you are feeling anxious, where you're feeling something is… is very important that will be done in a certain way and… and it's feeling uh… stressful or… or overwhelming in some way. Umm… If you could just uh… just write down umm… three things for me. One is, any physical feelings you're experiencing, you know, relate to the anxiety. So I don't know, if you get muscle tension or heart pounding or any of that stuff. Umm… If you could also jot down any thoughts that you're having, particularly anxious thoughts. So, you know, if I don't do this, it's going to be overwhelming or if I don't do this, this way then something terrible will happen to my daughter. Whatever the prediction is that you're having in this situation and then any anxious kinds of behaviors or perfectionistic behaviors you engage in. So it's three things, that's what's you're feeling, what you're thinking and what you're doing in this situation. 

00:50:45
AMY Okay. 

00:50:50
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… Because all of those contribute to uh… the anxiety that you're feeling. So we can… we can write those down at the end and discuss. You know, you're probably thinking about your exam coming up. So… Good, anything else umm… 

00:51:00
AMY Umm… Was there anything that I should try changing now or… minimize doing or… 

00:51:10
MARTIN ANTONY Well, there's nothing you need to do right now. I think if you do some reading it will give you some ideas or things that you, you can do. If you want to begin breaking some of the rules and seeing what happens, you know, even one thing try not picking up some toys and see what happens. 

00:51:25
AMY Just thinking about that is giving me an anxiety attack right now. So just, you know, just, I don't know, it's just… 

00:51:30
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, don't. You know, don't. For now umm… the initial task is just to become more uh… pay more attention to what you're doing, to learn a little bit about perfectionism, as some of the strategies. We'll start working on it the next time. But if you do want to try some thing, that's certainly something you can do over the next couple of weeks. 

00:51:45
AMY Okay. 

00:51:45
MARTIN ANTONY Great. 

00:51:45
AMY All right, thank you very much. 

00:51:50
MARTIN ANTONY Thank you. 

00:51:50
JON CARLSON Martin, what did you learn in this first session with Amy? 

00:51:50
Martin M. Antony, PhD, ABPP 

00:51:55
MARTIN ANTONY Well, one thing we learnt is that her perfectionism really affects a wide range of situations in her life. It's not uh… narrowly focused. 

00:52:00
JON CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that she even mentioned that she had an eating disorder from itself and just vomiting and… and you let that go. How come? 

00:52:10
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, that had come up as well in our brief phone conversation before we… we sat down for the first session and umm… we decided at the time to, really because we only had six sessions, really to work on her perfectionism to limited to some of the general perfectionism, further issues that she had and to save that for another time. So uh… possibly to refer her to somebody specifically to work on that. Umm… Although, it necessarily is related to the perfectionism. 

00:52:35
JON CARLSON And so that's one of the things that you do in CBT work is really narrow the focus of your intervention? 

00:52:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, it's important because it is a problem focused kind of intervention. It's important to, to decide what your goals are going to be and what you're gonna focus on. And if I had more than six sessions with her, if I had 12 to 15 sessions, we certainly would have uh… tackled the uh… eating issue. 

00:53:00
JON CARLSON Now in this session, you did get into psycho education and you recommended that she, and actually gave her a copy of your book and you asked her to do some reading and work in it. What did you want her to learn from that? 

00:53:15
MARTIN ANTONY Well, because I was gonna be seeing her every couple of weeks, although, even if I was seeing her every week umm… I want the… the client to be thinking about the therapy between sessions. So I think engaging them in a self-help book that uh… umm… really is consistent with the type of therapy that you're doing, it helps keeping the person, it helps to keep the person involved in the therapy between sessions. Uh… And also helps to reinforce the material from the session. So if I'm in the moment, don't explain things quite as concisely as, I did in the book umm… it just gives her a chance to hear it again, maybe in a slightly different way to uh… reinforce the message. So the book basically goes through the same types of strategies that uh…, that we'll be planning to use in the therapy. 

00:53:55
JON CARLSON So it's sort of like notes on the therapy session that she can refer back to and help to recall. 

00:54:00
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

00:54:00
JON CARLSON Now I noticed that she also mentioned in… in the session that she had, you know, really high standards for herself. But she didn't have those same standards for other people. Is that common? 

00:54:15
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… It depends on the type of perfectionism. And somebody who is depressed for example, they tend to… People with depression often will have very high standards for themselves and not necessarily the same high standards for others. But somebody like her umm… where we still a lot of sort of rules about how things have to be. Umm… It's more unusual for the perfectionism to just… just be self-oriented. Usually people will, they are often, they will have those rules for others as well. So it's something I'm gonna want to keep an eye on in the future sessions to see if uh… some examples of other oriented perfectionism do arise. 

00:54:50
JON CARLSON So it's possible, she may not be accurate in her views right now. 

00:54:55
MARTIN ANTONY It's… it's possible, yeah, something we want to look for. 

00:54:55
JON CARLSON Now, you know, our viewers are probably wondering this too. With the way she is representing herself with perfectionism, there's a lot of obsessiveness in… in this. Is there a personality disorder here? 

00:55:10
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, I think when I look at her perfectionism, umm… there… there are a lot of features of obsessive compulsive personality uh… disorder. Yeah and we… we never actually in the session did a proper uh… diagnostic assessment to find out whether all of the criteria for obsessive compulsive personality disorder would be met. Umm… But certainly uh… uh… a number of them including this uh… tends to be very detail oriented to make a list to need to have things done in a very precise way, would be consistent with that kind of a diagnosis. So it wouldn't surprise me if she uh… would have symptoms of meeting the full DSM four criteria for OCPD. 

00:55:50
JON CARLSON Now we're gonna move on to the second session and what are your goals and what are you hoping to accomplish next if you, you know, you know what happened in the first session and you're preparing for the second? 

00:56:00
MARTIN ANTONY Uh… In the second session I want to first of all, uh… I… I assume typically that some of these psycho education for the first session and some of the material from the first session may have slipped a little bit. So I want to recap some of the main points that we made in the first session and make sure that the goals that we set in the first session are… are still clear and… and still need the goals that she's interested in… in meeting over the course of the therapy. And then we want to begin using some of the strategies. Uh… So in the second session, my focus probably will be uh… uh… will be primarily on umm… cognitive strategies. So getting her to begin to uh… recognize the relationship between thoughts and feelings and to begin to shift those thoughts. 

00:56:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. Well, let's watch. 

00:56:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

00:56:45
JON CARLSON This is session number two of CBT for problems of perfectionism. 

00:56:55
Session 2 

00:57:00
MARTIN ANTONY Hi, Amy. 

00:57:00
AMY Hi. 

00:57:00
MARTIN ANTONY Welcome back. And what I'd like to do today is I'd like to actually begin by setting a plan for today. So umm… I'll talk to you a little bit about some of the things that I, I'd like to cover today and then I also want to hear about anything that you'd like to make sure that we cover today as well. Umm… I'd like to take a bit of time to just review a little bit about what we talked about last time umm… and just to spend a couple of weeks just to sort of refresh our memories for where we are at and begin to talk about strategies for changing some of the things that you've come into work on. 

00:57:35
AMY Okay. 

00:57:35
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… Is there anything specifically you want to make sure that we cover today? 

00:57:40
AMY Umm… Well, actually I think when I did the assignment for this time, when I was reading some of those stuff in your book, I realized that there's actually some other stuff that I would really want to work on to umm… and one more, some of the stuff that we talked about last week umm… I never realized how much like anger and frustration was uh… like a result of some of my tendencies, you know, when things don't get done and things aren't my way or when I don't believe that they're done properly and uh… I mentioned, I think last time that I tend to get kind of angry with my best friend and umm… she seems, I get a little frustrated and irritated with, like with my kids when they don't do things right or with my husband as well, you know, like when he loads the dishwasher wrong because you can optimize more space. I thought, you know, umm… like for some reason my best friend and I are very… very different. We've always like compliment each other really well and I don't know lately, it's just like, every little thing that she does, irritates me, you know, she's, I don't know. And I get angry with her and I like nitpick at things with her and I don't want to do that because my relationship with her is extremely important to me and I don't, I'm afraid that that's gonna be lost if I continue to treat her the way I have been. 

00:59:00
MARTIN ANTONY Why do you think that is that you uh… with her specifically that you nitpick on things? 

00:59:05
AMY Because I don't know, I've never had a sister umm… and in college, I mostly hung out with guys, like guys were usually my closest friends and she was my first like best girlfriend since like early childhood. And her and I are just Like extremely close. We spend a lot of time together and I don't know if just that we spend too much time together, we get on each others nerves, which is pretty common when you do that with people. Umm… I guess but umm… I don't know. She just… I'm… I'm obviously, you know, I, I think that I'm a hard worker and I put a lot of things on my plate and she just seems lazy and she complains about like, you know how tired she is when she works, when she actually work 40 hours that week. You know, and I'm sitting there going to school and I have a job and I have two kids and, you know, and I hate to compare and I know it but it's really hard for me not to and then… 

01:00:00
MARTIN ANTONY So those are things that get you frustrated with her when she complains about those? 

01:00:05
AMY Yeah, when she complains about how tired she is or she's always sick or umm… her and I have very different political views and then whenever we talk about certain things, you know, I just get agitated because she can't see my point of view and I… I don't know, you know, she won't do something because you know, would exert too much energy or effort on her part, you know. 

01:00:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So last time, we were focused mostly on the perfectionism uh… and sort of high standards you had for yourself. Umm… We talked a little bit about your friend but… but not in the context of the perfectionism so much. Umm… But it seems like from what you're saying, uh… is that some of what get you frustrated with her that she's not meeting certain standards or expectations that you have. 

01:00:45
AMY Right, and… 

01:00:50
MARTIN ANTONY It's not that she's treating you badly, it's nothing like that? 

01:00:55
AMY No. No. And, you know, I have other friends that are similar to her and they don't irritate me, or I have co-workers that, you know, I think that they could perform their job better but it doesn't bother me. 

01:01:00
MARTIN ANTONY Why do you think that is? 

01:01:05
AMY I don't know, I don't know if it's just that she's so close to me that I just want to control her or I don't know. I just write on like see that she can be better at things or if she just try a little bit harder, she could, I don't know. 

01:01:15
MARTIN ANTONY So you care more about her, maybe than you can be for other people. 

01:01:20
AMY Maybe I'm justifying that, by that fact that I care about her more to treat her poorly, you know, I don't know. 

01:01:25
MARTIN ANTONY How does that impact upon her? Does she… 

01:01:30
AMY Well, umm… actually umm… for a while we would talk like several… several times a day on the phone. And then for about two weeks, like we would barely talk even once a day or sometimes we would go like three days without talking ,you know. And umm… she gets mad at me if I don't prioritize, like talking to her on the phone, you know. Like if I don't call her, she thinks it's because I'm mad at her, I don't know, it's kind of childish sometimes, the way we interact with each other but umm… you know, I won't call her because my husband's home and I'd rather spend time with him because I don't see him all the time and her, you know, I want to play with my kids or whatever and, you know. When I mentioned those kinds of things to her, I don't know if it just irritates her too that, I throw things on her face, I don't know, but we both kind of… 

01:02:20
MARTIN ANTONY Just both of you are the elements of, both of you I guess contribute to some of the issues that you have. 

01:02:25
AMY Yeah. And I… I don't know, I just… And I don't want her… I don't think that she's a bad person and then I don't want to lose my friendship, I continuing to behave this way with her. 

01:02:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:02:35
AMY You know. 

01:02:40
MARTIN ANTONY So… Okay. Well, we can, we can definitely talk about things that you can do umm… to change in terms of uh… that relationship as well. And… and you mentioned uh… also your husband. You give an example, he loads the dishwasher the wrong way. 

01:02:50
AMY Yeah. 

01:02:50
MARTIN ANTONY So based on your reading so far, I know, you've only gotten, you've gotten into a lot of descriptive information about perfectionism, not so much to have it change it yet. Umm… But any… any thoughts based on what you've read so far about umm… that issue in particular, your husband loading the dishwasher the wrong way and you reacting to that. Umm… So I mean, there's two ways of dealing with that. One is teaching him a little bit of dishwasher properly and teaching him how to do everything else properly, so that it's exactly the way it needed to be done. Umm… The other option is uh… is changing your standard around that or your expectations umm… and you know, because you're here and we're doing this, I assume that, you know, at least with respect to some of these things that… that umm… part of what you want to do has changed that… that behavior. 

01:03:35
AMY Yeah. 

01:03:40
MARTIN ANTONY So what… what can you imagine doing umm… around the, that particular issue. Getting frustrated about him a little bit with the dishwasher. 

01:03:45
AMY I actually I kind of like go there a little bit. Because whenever he loads the dishwasher, you know, I'll just go in and rearrange it after him, like, when he sit down watching TV or whatever. Umm… But I found that I have a tendency like if he, like will clear the table and help with the dishes in the sink, I get just as annoyed with him, I'm upset as if he loaded the dishwasher on. Because I'm like, okay, why couldn't you have done that one extra step? And when I've said that to him, he's just like, because you're gonna come right back and change it behind me anyway, so why should I do all that work when you're gonna go around and redo that work. 

01:04:15
MARTIN ANTONY So with the dishwasher, you haven't actually changed your… your expectation or your standard. What you've done is just, you've… you've corrected afterwards. 

01:04:20
AMY Right. 

01:04:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So we'll… anyway well come back, we'll come back to umm… to that. I want to just umm… for a minute just review what… what some of your goals or therapy were and some of the motivations for doing the therapy. So one of the issues is, you'd noticed that your children are starting to clean up umm… or get sort of uh… particular about how things are arranged and you're worried about the uh… your own behavior, sort of rubbing off on… on your kids and having them have the same kind of high expectations and standards umm… umm… that you do. Umm… You've also mentioned that you just generally want to be more accepting of… of yourself uh… than you are not as critical of yourself. Umm… More relaxed, more figidity, uh… you did mention less, being less irritable with your best friend. 

01:05:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:05:10
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… but it sounds like with your husband as well. 

01:05:15
AMY It's actually… I don't… I don't… I don't really get too irritated with him. The only time that things ever get to me with him is like, with the cleaning thing, like, we're kind of different on that. And when we put the kids to bed, I'll clean up the whole house right away. Where he'll sit down and relax for a while and watch TV, you know. So even if I need to get school work done, if he's sitting down watching TV, I can't concentrate on my school work, until, the house is picked up. So if he's not gonna do it, I'll go and do it. And then, you know, he's like, I'll just do it later, but I… I, you know, I just… 

01:05:40
MARTIN ANTONY You can't do that. 

01:05:45
AMY I just need to let go with it. You know, it's okay that the puzzle pieces are on the floor, you know. 

01:05:50
MARTIN ANTONY So how do you… How would you do that, do you think? 

01:05:50
AMY I don't know. I've no idea. You know, because that really happened this Monday night because I had to finish my, one of my papers and… You know, I'm sitting there trying to type or whatever and you know, I keep looking behind me and seeing stuff on the floor or whatever. So I start picking up and then, he's like, I'll do it later. Just let me relax a minute, you know, and… 

01:06:10
MARTIN ANTONY You feel like you can't do that? 

01:06:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:06:15
MARTIN ANTONY Because if you did, what would happen? 

01:06:15
AMY Absolutely nothing. 

01:06:15
MARTIN ANTONY What does it feel like though? 

01:06:20
AMY I don't know, I just, I get irritated a little bit. Umm… I get even more ansy about stuff, like I can't sit still in my chair to concentrate on school work and those kinds of things. 

01:06:30
MARTIN ANTONY So what are you predicting will happen, do you think? Usually when people are anxious, uh… they're feeling an emotion, it's usually because they are interpreting, if it's an anxiety kind of emotions, it's usually because they are interpreting a situation threatening in some way or dangerous or, not that someone is gonna kill you or whatever but… but. Right, but, but there is some sort of threat or you have to be uh… on guard and you know, that creates a feeling of anxiety. Any idea what… what… what you think the threat is in that situation? 

01:07:00
AMY No. I don't. My dad has always been like an neat freak. My Grandma has been an neat freak. 

01:07:05
MARTIN ANTONY Let's talk about your dad for a minute. What do you think he's afraid of? Why would it be so important for him to have things in a certain way? 

01:07:15
AMY He's, I don't know, because he's a very anxious and ansy figiddy person too. Umm… And, you know, if something is on the table, he gets upset about it and he has to move it right away, you know. Umm… I don't know, he's… I'm not sure, he's a real quiet passive person at home but he's very involved in active in his work and very well known and very respected and he just kind of… I don't know. I don't know what causes him to… I don't know if it's a control thing, maybe that's it. 

01:07:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, that's what, that's what I was wondering, whether there's a sense that if you let a few things fall apart or not… not happened exactly the way you want them to happen, that somehow you're losing control or things will get completely out of control or that you won't be able to cope with that feeling. The feeling will get so overwhelming that uh… you'll feel out of control in a situation. 

01:08:05
AMY Yeah, like. Yeah, I would, control would probably be a thing for me. 

01:08:05
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:08:10
AMY Like when… If my husband is gonna take the kids somewhere, I make sure that I have the diaper bag, to make sure that he has everything because he might not think of it. 

01:08:10
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:08:15
AMY You know, and sometimes that's just because he doesn't go with just the kids as often as I might, but I also have to like… 

01:08:20
MARTIN ANTONY Why might else he make uh… mistakes in those situations? 

01:08:25
AMY Umm… Because of my standards probably, like… 

01:08:30
MARTIN ANTONY Well, yeah, part of it, he may just not live up to them. I'm also wondering whether he hasn't a chance to learn the right way to do things because you're making sure that it's done correctly. 

01:08:40
AMY I don't give him a chance usually, no. 

01:08:40
MARTIN ANTONY So I mean, probably if he forgot the diapers a couple of times, he'd learn pretty quickly that he needs to pack the diapers. 

01:08:45
AMY Right. 

01:08:45
MARTIN ANTONY I would think so. Umm… So that's something you don't give him a chance to uh…, to make mistakes. 

01:08:55
AMY Well, like every once in a while I won't care that… that like, you know, my kids books are off the desk. They have a lot of books, you know, when I off the desk him every night, you know, that's something that just takes away too much time that you know, it's not like my kids can read yet that they know, if they want the ABC book, that they two in the front, you know. Well, now they know that because they already know where their favoirite books are. But I mean, if I let, you know, advertising of their books go, it's not gonna be the end of anybody's world. 

01:09:20
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:09:25
AMY You know and you know I have one dishwasher with my husband style before, the dishes will still be clean and I realized that, you know, so I don't. 

01:09:35
MARTIN ANTONY What happened when you did it? 

01:09:35
AMY I was, I don't know, I was fine with it once, you know, I unloaded them. 

01:09:40
MARTIN ANTONY Were you uncomfortable when you did it though? 

01:09:40
AMY Yeah. 

01:09:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, why did you decide to do it? 

01:09:45
AMY Because I just need to let go. 

01:09:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so you made a decision that it's a good thing for you to do, and, and did you get something out of the experience. 

01:09:55
AMY Yeah, I just, you know, with the whole dishwasher thing and I know that, that's this really lame example but it's kind of in our house all the time because we wash dishes everyday but, I mean, I was just sitting around, I thought to let it go, you know, my husband is not wrong or he's not a bad person because he loads the dishwasher differently than I do. So I just put the soap in and press the start button and it was fine. 

01:10:15
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:10:20
AMY You know, I, I did feel good that I just let go for a while but then the next day, I did the same thing again like I went back to my way. 

01:10:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:10:25
AMY So… 

01:10:25
MARTIN ANTONY You know one of the thing about it is that none of the things, you do are problem in of themselves. You know, if for the rest of your life, you had to have the dishwasher load in a certain way and you did that and who cares, you know, everybody has little things that they do their you know, a little bit different than other people do things and I think the, the uh… in your case what makes it a problem is not, not any one of these things but when you add them all up, the quantity, the amount of time that it takes up and the amount of anxiety that it gives you umm… to, to have to, be able to control all these things that uh… you know that anybody would find very, very difficult uh… to control is what creates the problem. So umm… so how, how would you begin to change this? You had this experience with the dishwasher where you did things a different way and you actually got some thing out of it. You found out that nothing terrible happened. It was actually fine. Umm… did you had, was there a sense of uh… uh… afterwards of wow, this is actually. 

01:11:30
AMY Easy. 

01:11:30
MARTIN ANTONY It's not so bad. 

01:11:30
AMY Yeah. 

01:11:30
MARTIN ANTONY So you had that experience afterwards. 

01:11:35
AMY Yeah, because with the dishwasher experience, you know, I just, put the soap in and started in, then I went and sat down, we watched TV together and like, that just saved me, you know, ten minutes of reorganizing that whole dishwasher for nothing getting any more clean. 

01:11:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:11:45
AMY You know. And this past few days, I've been trying to like, you know when toys are on the floor just to read my textbooks or do my school work and you know let my husband rest for you know 15-20 minutes however long he wants to rest and then he can get up and do, you know. 

01:12:05
MARTIN ANTONY So if you were, if you were to apply what you've learnt from the toys, letting the toys sit on the floor and the dishwasher to other things in your life, what would you do uh… differently to begin to change this problem, do you think? 

01:12:20
AMY Umm… I don't know. I'm not ready to give up my list yet. 

01:12:25
MARTIN ANTONY In a general sense, without talking of specific things, what would the general strategy be for beginning to change this problem? 

01:12:35
AMY I'm not sure. 

01:12:40
MARTIN ANTONY I'm wondering, I mean, it sounds like really what you've done on these couple of occasions is broken some of the rules and, and discovered that even when you break the rules, nothing terrible happens. Umm… so I'm wondering whether if we were to build on that and, and start to break more rules umm… whether you'd actually start to feel a sense of relief from this. 

01:13:00
AMY I'm in chaos right now. 

01:13:05
MARTIN ANTONY So you look, you look that way and you want to mention that, that makes you feel anxious. Why do you think that is? 

01:13:10
AMY I just… 

01:13:10
MARTIN ANTONY Use the word chaos. 

01:13:10
AMY I'm feeling it in my chest right now. Umm… I don't know, I just, I feel like I have control on things. Like the world will fall apart. 

01:13:20
MARTIN ANTONY Your world will fall apart. Okay. Well, the next thing about this approach is you don't have to give up control over everything. You can pick and choose the things that you give, give up control over and there are probably a lot of things that you do that are very helpful that do kind of keep things together that most people would look at and say, wow, this is actually a very good idea. You know, that's, you know and you probably get compliments lot for things that you do. Umm… and, and those things, we might not want to change at all. Umm… and so what we want to do is probably focus more on the things that are umm… taking up more time and energy than what you're getting back for them. 

01:14:00
AMY Like advertising my kids work. 

01:14:05
MARTIN ANTONY That's a good example. Maybe when they are old enough to read uh… 

01:14:05
AMY Yeah. 

01:14:05
MARTIN ANTONY You could read this yeah but also an example. But again ultimately it would be up to you which, which of these things are, are standards that are important to keep them, which ones are, are standards that are not important to keep that. And then even, even if there might be other situations where the world, your world might be a slightly better place if you didn't, if you, if you did take care of things and kept these standards but there might still be reasons to, to let go of them and an example, I'm thinking of is your husband and the diaper bag. Umm… the advantages of letting him leave the house without everything he needs a couple of times. Umm… just from the perspective of him being more involved in the process and learning to take more responsibility for it and figuring, figuring some of that out for himself, for example. 

01:14:50
AMY Yeah. 

01:14:50
MARTIN ANTONY So umm… so one, one uh… possible strategy that we would want to look at is beginning to start to break and already the great thing is you've already tried that with a couple of situations and gotten something out of it. Umm… and seeking, when I say, breaks through you, is different up a little bit, so that's, that's difficult. But again, supports the idea that this is a uh… to some extent an anxiety based kind of problem. It's a problem where it feels dangerous in some way to do things differently. Umm… which also is making me think this might be a good strategy umm… because if you think of other fears that people have, fears of dogs or fears of driving or fears of flying. What do you imagine if you're afraid of dogs, the best way to get over that fear would be? 

01:15:45
AMY I don't know to, I don't, I don't know. Umm… 

01:15:45
MARTIN ANTONY Do you think you used to be afraid of it but you're not afraid of it anymore. 

01:15:45
AMY Bridges. 

01:15:50
MARTIN ANTONY Bridges. 

01:15:50
AMY Over water. 

01:15:50
MARTIN ANTONY Now you are not afraid of them so much anymore? 

01:15:50
AMY Nope. 

01:15:50
MARTIN ANTONY How did you get over that? 

01:15:55
AMY Because I have to deal with it twice a day going to and from work. 

01:15:55
MARTIN ANTONY You're doing my work for me. So exposure basically over and over again, got over your fear of bridges. And how was it the first time you had to do it? 

01:16:05
AMY Umm… probably very dangerously, I uh… got the steering wheel, drove really fast and I kind of closed my eyes. 

01:16:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. And I've heard that from people. I've actually seen people who are afraid of driving cover their eyes uh… one person who actually covered her eyes when she was driving. Okay, so yes, it was dangerous, frightening umm… how was it the second time? 

01:16:25
AMY Umm… it was that way for a while. 

01:16:30
MARTIN ANTONY How long did it take to get start to get better? 

01:16:35
AMY Probably, a few months, not that I was closing my eyes anymore but till like where I got. 

01:16:40
MARTIN ANTONY Comfortable. 

01:16:40
AMY Like where I wasn't like, you know my palms weren't sweaty and my heart wasn't racing and… 

01:16:45
MARTIN ANTONY How long did it take to get a little bit better? 

01:16:45
AMY Probably like a few weeks. 

01:16:45
MARTIN ANTONY Few weeks, okay so pretty quick actually. You noticed some changes very quickly and then, it continued to get better over, over a few months. Umm… well, that's exactly what you'll probably experience with umm… beginning to make changes around, around these kinds of uh… behaviors as well that, at first, it will be very anxiety provoking, hopefully not as anxiety provoking as the uh… bridge umm… Some of these things might be wrong. Some of these things might be terrifying to begin to change but if they're important to you, the way the bridge uh… getting where the bridge was uh… and you keep doing it, it will get easier and to me people get used to anything and people put stories of umm… in World War II of people in London getting used to the sounds of bombs going off in their neighborhood, you know, the beginning was terrifying and people just kind of get used to the sound. Umm… if you think of the survivor, the people spent 39 days in the middle no where with no showers, no, you know the thought of going three days without shower probably is anxiety provoking but people just kind of get used to that. If you've ever gone camping in the middle of no where and haven't had a shower, people just kind of get used to that. 

01:18:00
AMY That's why I don't go camping. I go hiking but then I go to a hotel. 

01:18:00
MARTIN ANTONY Right. Umm… but, but people can get used to things that most people couldn't imagine getting used to umm… and, and what, the things that here that you, that you will be working on are things that the average person probably could do and not necessarily feel anxious umm… so the things that will make them anxious. 

01:18:15
AMY Right. 

01:18:20
MARTIN ANTONY But they are different for different people, so… 

01:18:20
AMY I don't want people to think I'm lazy though. Like if I don't clean up right away and you know, it tend to base a lot of my thoughts and what I think other people think of me and you know. 

01:18:35
MARTIN ANTONY Do people uh… what do people think of you? 

01:18:35
AMY I have no idea. But I don't know, I just, you know, that's why I want to like do all those things with my kids and why I want to get, well, I want to get good grades because it makes me feel good too but you know, it's important for me to be, you know, talk with professors or to classmates or you know, like when we get together with on play groups or you'd know my daughter will start talking some of the things that we did and you do so much with your kids, that makes me feel good. You know, it makes me feel like I'm like the perfect momma for a group of friends and like it puts me in a pedestal and I thrive on that and I think most people would. 

01:19:10
MARTIN ANTONY Are there any disadvantages of this for your kids though? 

01:19:15
AMY Over stimulation umm… umm… they could be pushing them too hard. 

01:19:20
MARTIN ANTONY What is the modeling, the behavior that you have to do everything perfectly. 

01:19:25
AMY Right, which is why my main reason for doing this is because I don't want my kids to. 

01:19:30
MARTIN ANTONY So what you, you told me right at the beginning is that uh… the best thing for your kids might actually be for you to be less perfect. 

01:19:40
AMY Yeah. But then I want to do things with them because I want to have that experience with them and I want them to have that experience with me or with my husband or with you know, relatives or friends or whatever, you know. I want them to have like you know… You know, fun things and educational things and you know. 

01:19:55
MARTIN ANTONY So what would a perfect childhood for them be? Would it be one that's completely stimulated where everything happens at a certain time and every Friday, you bake and umm… your books are alphabetized or where a perfect childhood would be one that maybe has a balance of doing lots of things but also letting some stuff go and… 

01:20:15
AMY I like them to be able to have a little bit freedom. But I have a hard time letting go of controlling certain things. You know, I just… 

01:20:25
MARTIN ANTONY You can actually use this, this umm… desire to have things be perfect to uh… to sort of actually help you make this change. You know, if you think of the ideal uh… environment for the children as being one that's, that's more balanced, where there is more freedom and some structure and you know, doing fun things but then also some freedom and, and getting messy and not doing anything perfectly as a more perfect child in a way than you know, setting that balance as a goal potentially that would actually be better even though, it would feel very uncomfortable. 

01:21:05
AMY But it will get better right? 

01:21:05
MARTIN ANTONY What, what do you think based on your experience with the bridges? What did you predicted before that the bridges would get easier? 

01:21:10
AMY No, because I used to refuse a drive over them. If I knew you were coming up on a bridge, I would switch drivers, you know. I just couldn't handle them. 

01:21:20
MARTIN ANTONY So you had no choice basically. Which is what uh… 

01:21:25
AMY Yeah, I don't have the money to hire a driver take me to work. 

01:21:25
MARTIN ANTONY Right, so yeah, I, I can't promise you that by doing this. It will get easier what I can tell you is that, it almost always does. And most people I've worked with you've umm… put the energy into doing things differently and, and making the change and doing it day in and day out, I've noticed uh… that things get better. The way, you do, we call it exposure therapy because basically, you're exposing yourself to things that, that are frightening to you. And the way you do it seems to make a difference. So for example, if you're afraid of uh… dogs and a dog started chasing you, that kind of exposure wouldn't help. So in fact, it will make you fear worse, right because exposure uh… first of all, the sense of control is important. So umm… it's not gonna help you if people umm… around you start doing everything wrong just to expose you to it. It's much more important that you're in control of the situation and that you make a decision to do things differently. 

01:22:20
AMY Okay. 

01:22:20
MARTIN ANTONY So when you go home and you say to your husband, you know, what, I'm not gonna, you know, from now on, you're in charge of the dishwasher, I'm not gonna check it, I'm not gonna do anything. You don't have to, you know, what, you don't have to make for now on a commitment. You can say for next two weeks to see what happens. Umm… so you're in control umm… so that's, that's very important for this kind of stuff. It's not that people are doing to you, it's a decision that you're making. Umm… the other thing is very important is uh… the frequency of these practices. So with the bridge umm… you probably went over bridges, a couple of times a year and it didn't help. 

01:22:55
AMY Right. 

01:22:55
MARTIN ANTONY It's not until you started doing several times a week that you began to notice a change and that it's very important for these, for the uh… anxiety around this and the discomfort to change that, that the practice has happened frequently. So that's another thing to umm… uh… to keep in mind as you do this and you don't, you know, there are some things probably that would be completely overwhelming to you, to change right now and you don't have to change those things. We can start with things that are difficult but manageable. 

01:23:20
AMY Okay. 

01:23:25
MARTIN ANTONY Things that you will find are anxiety provoking but not terrifying or you know, completely uh… unmanageable. Umm… you may find that you know for at the beginning, it will make things more stressful but, but then you'll start to see a change. So, does it sound like a reasonable plan? 

01:23:40
AMY Yeah, I, yeah, it does. Like with the housework and stuff, as much as I know it is a control thing but I also don't want to make my husband feel like I'm just like pushing everything on him either, like it's like, the whole perception thing again. 

01:23:55
MARTIN ANTONY Would he think that? 

01:23:55
AMY I don't know. I mean, I only work part-time, he works full-time. 

01:24:00
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:24:00
AMY You know. So… 

01:24:05
MARTIN ANTONY What percentage of the child care you do? 

01:24:05
AMY Umm… actually he does do a lot. I don't want to give that impression either. 

01:24:10
MARTIN ANTONY What percent? 

01:24:10
AMY Well, probably, well, I definitely do more than half because I'm home with the girls a lot more. Umm… but he usually gets their back every night and he puts them on to bed every night, you know. We share the responsibility of making them dinner, you know, we treat them about that. So umm… you know, when he is there, he does a lot with them but… 

01:24:35
MARTIN ANTONY Does he know, you're doing this therapy? 

01:24:35
AMY Yes. 

01:24:35
MARTIN ANTONY So if you were to tell him that uh… in order for you to become more comfortable with things not being perfect, you're gonna do a little bit less, would he be supportive of that work? 

01:24:45
AMY Oh, yeah, he thinks this is a great thing that I'm doing this. 

01:24:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so he's not gonna feel like you're dumping stuff on him. 

01:24:50
AMY No. It's yeah, you're right. 

01:24:50
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So it feels. 

01:24:55
AMY Umm… but that comes back to other fears that you've mentioned where uh… you've said that people will think that you're a bad mother, if you don't do as much as you do. Umm… so what's the evidence for that, do you think? 

01:25:05
MARTIN ANTONY There is none because I don't think anything bad about other moms that don't push their kids in fact some people who push their kids too much, I just, they just irritate me. 

01:25:15
AMY You think, it's too much. 

01:25:15
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, I'm just like, let your kid be kid. Just let him have fun. Just relax about it and but then I try and do the same exact thing that I'm criticizing other people for doing, you know. 

01:25:25
AMY What do you think will happen if someone did think badly of you because you probably happen, where everybody thinks badly of one person or another. 

01:25:30
MARTIN ANTONY Right and that… 

01:25:35
AMY You may actually find out that uh… somebody is saying, she used to take her kids to all the stuff which I think is great but now she's kind of slacking off a bit. She's… Yeah. What would that mean about you? 

01:25:45
MARTIN ANTONY I feel like, I was inadequate. 

01:25:50
AMY Yeah. So somebody had that thought, it would be true basically. 

01:25:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:25:50
AMY Yeah. 

01:25:55
MARTIN ANTONY So in other words, looking at that. 

01:25:55
AMY I don't know because you know, if someone is you know, if one person is thinking that, then I'm sure that more people are thinking that and then you know, I don't know. 

01:26:05
MARTIN ANTONY If one person is thinking that, does that mean that most people are thinking? 

01:26:10
AMY No, not necessarily but I'm sure that they're not the only person thinking that and you know and I, I think part of it that kind of pushes me to continue to behave the way, I do is that like the comments I get, you know, oh I think it's still great that you do this all the time with your kids and you do that, you know and so it just pushes me to do a little bit more. 

01:26:25
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:26:30
AMY And I'm afraid that it's kind of like that a little bit more every time, I receive a compliment just a little extremed or way too out of hand or you know because springtime is right around the corner and I go nuts in spring with my kid. So, you know, we go to zoo all the time and we go downtown all the time and you know. 

01:26:50
MARTIN ANTONY So umm… so people do think that about you because again, if you start to change things somebody may think that maybe and you said that if one person is maybe other people are, maybe three people will think that. Umm… and your thoughts was that, if a few people think that, that means it's true. That means, I am inadequate in some way. Does that thought make sense to you? 

01:27:15
AMY Yeah. Sure, probably it shouldn't but umm… 

01:27:15
MARTIN ANTONY Do few people think umm… uh… say it's not you, let's say it's me in the situation and uh… instead of umm… do activities planned with your children most, most evenings? 

01:27:30
AMY Not evenings, during the day, when it's just me. 

01:27:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:27:35
AMY And I don't know if it's like a boredom thing for me. 

01:27:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:27:35
AMY Or like, I don't want to just sit around the house all day, you know. 

01:27:40
MARTIN ANTONY You like to be busy. 

01:27:40
AMY Yeah. 

01:27:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Well, let's say, let's says uh… let's think a very specific thing you've mentioned which is baking every Friday and that this very important if that get done. Umm… if you were to not do that and a couple of people thought uh… she's slacking off, she's not uh… sticking to that plan that she had umm… to do baking every Friday. 

01:28:00
AMY That would be okay with me. 

01:28:05
MARTIN ANTONY That would be okay. 

01:28:05
AMY Yeah. 

01:28:05
MARTIN ANTONY Give me example of one that wouldn't be okay. 

01:28:10
AMY Umm… I don't know, I don't know if it's just the way like that you, that you said it you know like, you know, I can't believe she's not doing it anymore or versus, someone thinking like actually thinking that I'm inadequate, inadequate mom. You know. 

01:28:25
[sil.] 

01:28:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So can you… 

01:28:30
AMY Umm… 

01:28:35
MARTIN ANTONY think of a thought that you've had that oh no, somebody will think such and such if I, if they see me doing this. Any situation that has come up over the last week where you were worried about what people might think. 

01:28:45
AMY I think when it comes to my kids, or. 

01:28:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Yeah or something else could be school work. Exam last time in that, you didn't think, you did well on that, yeah, so what were, what were your thoughts around that? Were there worries about what professors might think about you? 

01:29:05
AMY Yeah. 

01:29:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:29:10
AMY You know. Umm… because I'm in a masters program umm… most of the people who are in there tend to be a little bit more perfect, more of a perfectionist than like the average Joe. Umm… you know they want to do well. They excel at what they do, those kinds of things. So umm… if I don't do well, I will be compared to my classmates who are doing better than I am. So therefore there won't be as good as than on professional level when I'm doing school. 

01:29:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:29:35
AMY Or… 

01:29:40
MARTIN ANTONY What if the professor thought that? 

01:29:40
AMY That make me feel really bad. 

01:29:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, what would that mean if a professor thought that? 

01:29:45
AMY Well, they are kind of like the experts, so you know, their thoughts something like that would have a lot more pull behind it or weight behind it than just. 

01:30:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you think all professors agree about which students are the strongest or which students are not the strongest. 

01:30:00
AMY No, no. 

01:30:05
MARTIN ANTONY But they're all experts umm… 

01:30:05
AMY Right. 

01:30:05
MARTIN ANTONY But they disagree. Why do you think they disagree? 

01:30:10
AMY They all have different standards on what makes a good student or what would make a good like professional person be on the point of school, you know. 

01:30:20
MARTIN ANTONY Do they all have different expectations? I imagine students are different in different classes. It's just, you might be well in one class and not well in another or… 

01:30:25
AMY Like math versus English. 

01:30:30
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, so uh… which one do you do well in? 

01:30:30
AMY Math. 

01:30:30
MARTIN ANTONY Math, okay. So maybe your math teacher will think you're brilliant, your English teacher would think … 

01:30:35
AMY Right. 

01:30:35
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… so is, is that uh… and would that, would that mean anything? 

01:30:40
AMY What the English teacher thought? I mean, no because I have no interest in that kind of thing. 

01:30:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:30:45
AMY That my professors that I'm taking classes with now, all my classes lie with what I have an interest in. 

01:30:55
MARTIN ANTONY But with the, I guess one of the reasons, just because the professor have that thought would that mean that you're not gonna be a good counselor? 

01:31:00
AMY No. Not necessarily but it would make me feel pretty bad or it will make me feel like maybe I'm not going into the right profession or maybe I won't be good at it. But it doesn't necessarily mean that I won't be. It just makes me feel like I might not be. 

01:31:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:31:15
AMY You know, that's really confusing the way, I said. 

01:31:15
MARTIN ANTONY No, I understand what you're saying. So umm… so if they said, exam has gone as poorly as you thought it had uh… it would have raised some doubts about whether you're cut out for this or… 

01:31:30
AMY No, no, it would be rather I was cut out for it or more so just, you know, I don't know. I mean, like you, you had me, you mean the assignment to like write down like, if I have any anxious moments whatever and when I went on to find out my grade for my test, that was an anxious moment when I saw that I have a new grades. I almost threw up. Like that's how intense those feelings are like, I thought I did that better, like you know, like I can, am already starting to feel those feelings again, just talking about it. You know, like I felt really naseous and I was sweating and my palms were sweaty and you know like my heart was racing and you know, it was just a horrible feeling and then when I got the grade, it was such a relief but I took a long time for those feelings to like subside. 

01:32:15
MARTIN ANTONY What if you've done poorly on it? What if you've done as poorly as you thought you had? 

01:32:20
AMY I probably would have thrown up. 

01:32:20
MARTIN ANTONY I mean, in terms of what it mean about you? 

01:32:25
AMY I don't know what it would mean about me. I just, I just know how it make me feel. 

01:32:30
MARTIN ANTONY And you feel that way because… 

01:32:35
AMY It's a lot of, like I said before about how I base a lot of like who I am and what I think other people think of me, same thing goes with my grades. 

01:32:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:32:45
AMY I do long class. 

01:32:45
MARTIN ANTONY Professor will think I'm in here. 

01:32:45
AMY Yeah, like that might be impressive to the teacher like well, she really knows her stuff or she really cares about this class or she tries really harder, you know. 

01:32:55
MARTIN ANTONY And if the professor didn't think that, eventually that would mean, you're not gonna be a good counselor or… 

01:33:00
AMY Right, or maybe they think that, I don't care or that I'm not trying or that I'm being lazy and I don't know I've been thought of being lazy. 

01:33:10
MARTIN ANTONY Like anyone ever. 

01:33:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:33:15
MARTIN ANTONY So, does that seem, is it important to you that people like you? 

01:33:15
AMY Yes. 

01:33:15
MARTIN ANTONY Generally, all the time? 

01:33:20
AMY Well, there, I mean, yeah like you said before, there are certain people that I don't care feeling about. 

01:33:20
MARTIN ANTONY There are certain people, it's fair. 

01:33:25
AMY Yeah. Like and it's, this is so weird but like, this is like where I feel like I'm back in grade school junior high with my thought process because, you know, I worry more about what my acquaintances think of me than like my best friend. 

01:33:40
MARTIN ANTONY All right. 

01:33:40
AMY Because I know like, she's like my family member, you know, when I treat her bad, she's still there for me. You know, my house isn't clean, she doesn't care. You know, when she comes over my kids have to always replace. I know that she's not judging me based on how my house looks. 

01:33:55
MARTIN ANTONY Is it possible for all your acquaintances to like you? 

01:34:00
AMY No. 

01:34:00
MARTIN ANTONY Do you think of anybody that everybody likes? 

01:34:05
AMY No. 

01:34:05
MARTIN ANTONY No. Does everybody like your husband? 

01:34:10
AMY Probably not because he's a pretty likable guy. 

01:34:10
MARTIN ANTONY Even, even him, he's a likable guy, not everybody likes. 

01:34:15
AMY Right. I can recount some people in college who connects with him. 

01:34:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:34:20
AMY So… 

01:34:20
MARTIN ANTONY Do you think anybody, that everybody dislikes? 

01:34:25
AMY No. Except for maybe you know like (inaudible) or something. 

01:34:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:34:30
AMY But they didn't like him, they didn't, all have just like until they knew what he did. So… 

01:34:30
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, yeah. 

01:34:30
AMY I mean… 

01:34:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, true, yeah. So umm… what makes people uh… You know why is that… that uh… umm… So on the one hand it seems impossible for everybody to like dating one person? 

01:34:45
AMY Right. I know, it's not an achievable goal. I know that I'm not gonna be liked by everybody and I know that everybody is not gonna think highly of me. But… 

01:34:50
MARTIN ANTONY Why do you think that is that not everybody could like you? 

01:34:55
AMY Because personality always clash. Priorities are different, standards are different. 

01:35:00
MARTIN ANTONY So, there's a different view, would like different things about somebody. 

01:35:00
AMY Right. 

01:35:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… Well, this brings me to sort of a point that I want to highlight for this… this therapy that… that you've probably come across in the book already is that umm… what often drives anxiety is our beliefs about situations. So if you, if you believe that a situation is dangerous or threatening or you believe that it's important that everybody likes me or uh… you believe that things have to be done in certain way, your body in terms of the anxiety will react as if that believe is…. is true basically, whether it is not. 

01:35:35
AMY Right. 

01:35:35
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… So people don't react so much to uh… things that happen in their life but they react to as their interpretations of things that happen in their life. You know, the… the reason people… The reason you're afraid of bridges is not because they were dangerous, you're afraid of bridges because you believe they were dangerous in the situation. So in some cases uh… these beliefs are true and uh… in other cases, they may not be. Umm… So in addition to beginning to change your behavior which we've begun to talk about. Umm… What I'd like you to do also is rather than, we all tend to believe our thoughts, you know, we all… We have a thought we think, oh, that's the truth, otherwise why would I have thought that? What I'd like you to begin to do though is to question your thoughts. Uh… and ask yourself are there other ways of looking at this situation? Umm… So most people like to be liked. You know, so it's not, it's not… Yeah, most people want to do well in exams and those are not unusual thoughts. But there are some people who couldn't care less with their life. You know, if you uh… umm… I can, I can think of certain celebrities who I've seen in interviews who are politicians who are sort of controversial figures umm… and you know, they are very clear that they are not here to make friends or then they don't, you know care whether uh… they are liked, which is again maybe unusual on the other side. I'm not suggesting that's the best way to be either. Umm… But it's not uh… I guess what stresses is not the only way to be, is to always do things uh… to necessarily have that kind of reactions. So rather than assuming that believe is true that is important to be liked umm… the goal of this therapy would begin to… to begin to question that. You know, you already sort of told me a few minutes ago that's impossible for everybody to like you or approve of the way, you do things. So would it be okay in the situation for that person, maybe to be that, the person that doesn't approve of the way I do things? You know, if you look at umm… as where, a very famous couples therapist who umm… uh… used to work with couples that used to fight upon all kinds of different things and she pointed out. Uh… She had actually done this, this thing where she counted the number of different ways that people can wash dishes and uh… she count 200 different ways of washing dishes. Yeah, they all kind of have the same end result. The dishes are clean at the end. Umm… Is… Just because it feels like this is the best way to do it, doesn't mean that that's the only way to do it. 

01:38:05
AMY No, and that's the problem is like, I realize these things. 

01:38:05
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:38:10
AMY But I'm not changing. 

01:38:10
MARTIN ANTONY Well, you realize it's sitting here now. You don't realize it necessarily that when your husband is putting the dishes in the dishwasher at that… 

01:38:20
AMY Right. But I mean, I know they are still gonna get cleaned. I, I do, but my thing is like, you know, he could fit so much more in there. 

01:38:25
MARTIN ANTONY Right. Right, yeah. So. 

01:38:25
AMY But I know that like, you know, he still fits everything in there but you know, it's just not like all the right, and that's what it is. All the glasses are on one side, all the bowls are lined up, you know, he just, a hodgepodge which is fine but it, it gets to me. 

01:38:40
MARTIN ANTONY But a question, a question to ask yourself in this situation and this is the goal this therapy is really to teach you to become your own therapist ultimately. So umm… in these next four or five meetings that we're gonna have umm… we can talk about different strategies but ultimately it's gonna take some time to begin to implement these strategies and, and make these changes but a question to ask yourself in that situation is, is this as important as it feels like it is? 

01:39:05
AMY Right. 

01:39:10
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… I'm going to give you a form that I'd like you to, to fill out over the next week when you do find yourself becoming anxious in these kinds of situations. Umm… and it's a form basically, you know, I'll give you a copy and for myself for a second where in the first column, you can put down what the situation is, so husband loaded the dishwasher a certain way. This made me feel the next column is your, your uh… anxiety, your, your sort of emotion that you felt was could be anxiety or frustration or sense of urgency. Your thoughts umm… uh… could be that, that this isn't right or umm… you know, I'm going to feel very uncomfortable or he could get more in there. Uh… and then in the next two columns are very important. This is where you begin to challenge those, those thoughts. So there is a column for evidence that supports your thought. Uh… and evidence that doesn't support your thought and then ultimately coming up with a more balanced thought. So if your prediction is uh… this isn't right, I won't, you know, I'm this is uh… I'm not gonna be able to cope with this, this is gonna be very uncomfortable uh… the evidence that supports that might be in the past, you've felt uncomfortable with this for example. Uh… evidence that sort of goes against the thought might be that well, even when I felt uncomfortable on the past, I've been able to cope and eventually run away. Last time, we did it with the dishwasher, it was, you know, in the end, it was fine. That kind of thing. And then trying to come up with a more balanced thought which in that case based on what you've talked about might be well, I might be uncomfortable temporarily but in the end that discomfort come down or I can tolerate that. Something like that would be an example. So umm… we've only got about 30 seconds left. So I brought this for a few minutes, earlier, but do you have any questions about what I'm looking for with this? 

01:41:00
AMY No, because that's kind of what you have. Well, there are similar one in the book that I kind of have, so. 

01:41:05
MARTIN ANTONY The one in the books are a little bit different. You can use the one in the book as well if that's uh… works better for you. Umm… and uh… and, and you can apply this to, to things at home, you can also apply it to the, the anger situations that you've mentioned umm… and the idea is to begin to again to question the thoughts. So is this as important as it feels for example? what will happen if somebody does think that about me? Can I cope with that? Would it be the end of the world? Would it be unusual? Umm… perspective shifting, so what would I think of somebody else who, who used to do that? Would I think badly of him? Umm… those sorts of things. 

01:41:45
AMY Okay. 

01:41:50
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… okay and then the last thing I want to do uh… just before we stop is can you think of uh… some behaviors that you could begin to change this week? 

01:42:00
AMY Like to continue with the housework stuff. 

01:42:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:42:05
AMY You know, I, I have to like go out of way. I'm just gonna, you know, it will just drive me badly, not having to do that with everything else. Umm… 

01:42:15
MARTIN ANTONY What about the dishwasher? 

01:42:15
AMY The dishwasher, I can, I can do the dishwasher. 

01:42:20
MARTIN ANTONY So next, just for the next couple of weeks, could you also go home and put the books in your children room in random order and leave them that way for a couple of weeks? 

01:42:30
AMY I think if my husband did it, I can leave it. But if I go and do it, I don't, well, I know, I can physically but umm… it will bother me. 

01:42:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:42:40
AMY And like I know, every time I pass the room, I'll just simply be going, that B is in the C area. 

01:42:45
MARTIN ANTONY Well, that's possible. You might also find that what happened with the bridge would happen. 

01:42:45
AMY Okay. 

01:42:45
MARTIN ANTONY But that would happen for a few days and then after a few days, you wouldn't care. It will be a great experiment. You know, you can come back in two weeks and say, you know what it bothered me the whole, the whole two weeks or you can come back and say, you know, it bothered me for a week and then it seemed to get easier. 

01:43:00
AMY Okay. 

01:43:00
MARTIN ANTONY We will try this experiment. 

01:43:00
AMY I'll try it. 

01:43:05
MARTIN ANTONY Perfect. Okay, then let's uh… let's leave it at that then and umm… I will see you in a couple of weeks. 

01:43:10
AMY All right, thanks. 

01:43:10
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:43:10
JON CARLSON And Marty in this session uh… you give her quite a bit of homework. How do you decide on the amount of homework to give her and the type of homework to give her? 

01:43:20
MARTIN ANTONY Uh… it varies from person to person. Uh… for some clients uh… even a little bit of home work can be very overwhelming. So we want to gauge it uh… uh… depending on uh… so how motivated the person is and how much they think they can do. Although sometimes people over estimate what they think, they can do. One nice thing about working with people like Amy who are very detailed oriented and always want to do a good job is they also want to do a good job in the therapy. Uh… so they, they're often uh… very compliant with the home work and sometimes even do more than what you asked them to do uh… and that was certainly the case with uh… Amy. I mean, she can, you know, she, certainly did everything that, that I asked her to do and umm… came back uh… having came back, having done a perfect job. I can imagine actually later in the therapy uh… if this pattern continues, we might want to set as a home work assignment not to do everything that I ask her to do or to show up a little bit late for a session or something like that. 

01:44:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. Psycho education really seems important at least at this stage in the therapy? 

01:44:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, because we're, we're trying to socialize her to the therapy at this point and umm… uh… and psycho education is one way of doing that just helping the person understand what the therapy is about and to what some of the strategies are. 

01:44:35
JON CARLSON And you accomplished a lot in this session and you expect a lot from her. 

01:44:40
MARTIN ANTONY Absolutely, yeah, it was a full session. Umm… we uh… just something that I want to come back to over the earlier question is that people uh… where the goals of cause and behavior therapy is to teach people to be their own therapists is something that will come up throughout the treatment and umm… from that perspective, psycho education is important as well uh… having the person really understand the therapy and why they are doing what they are doing. So a very transparent therapy in that way and umm… I have a lot of clients that I have seen for cognitive behavior therapy uh… by the end of treatment, probably could do call them behavioral therapy is as well as uh… a lot of people out there who are doing with me maybe last experience of training. 

01:45:25
JON CARLSON So as we move on to the third session, I'm sure one of the things you're gonna want to do is to see how she did on her home work. 

01:45:30
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, we want to begin each session with a setting an agenda and then usually that first item on the agenda is uh… assessing how people did with the home work over the previous week. 

01:45:45
JON CARLSON And what else are you open to accomplish as we move into the third session? 

01:45:50
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… I want to continue to use the cognitive strategies to uh… in more depth and prove her skills in using those. We'll also want to begin to increase these behavioral strategies as well and basically stepping things up a bit so trying things that are even more difficult than, than she may tried up until now.

01:49:00
MARTIN ANTONY Welcome back Amy. 

01:49:00
AMY Thank you. 

01:49:00
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… what I'd like to do today is to begin by reviewing the homework. See how that went and continuing to basically come up with strategies for changing the perfectionism over the next couple of weeks. Umm… is there anything that you'd like to add to that agenda before we start. 

01:49:20
AMY Umm…, well there are some things that I did over the past couple of weeks that was part of the homework, you know, the goals something. And then also I ended up talking about my best friend about me being here and her being one of the main topics that I was discussing and it went really, really well. 

01:49:30
MARTIN ANTONY Oh, great, okay. So I'll ask you about that as well, to do that. Umm… okay so let's, let me ask you about uh… about the home work to begin. So there are four tasks that we, we had. So one was to complete that monitoring form. 

01:49:50
AMY Which I don't have with me today. 

01:49:50
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… so what happened to the form? 

01:49:55
AMY Well, I was on my way over here today, my car started smelling like it was burning oil. So I switched cars with my husband and I left the book you gave me along with my homework inside the book. 

01:50:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:50:05
AMY In the car, so. 

01:50:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so no problem, so, you did, you did, it sounds like, you had time to complete the form but you just don't have it with you. 

01:50:10
AMY Right. 

01:50:10
MARTIN ANTONY So what we can do is maybe go through, do you remember some of the stuff that's on it? 

01:50:15
AMY Yeah. 

01:50:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, great. So we will do that umm… in a moment. Let's talk about, there are three, uh… three tasks in addition to the form that you would, that we talked about trying. One was to do a bit of more reading in the-book. Were you able to do that? 

01:50:30
AMY Yeah, I got through three of the four chapters. 

01:50:30
MARTIN ANTONY Oh, great. Okay, so can you tell me a bit about uh… anything from the book that stood out either as being really helpful or being maybe things she didn't agree with or things that got you nervous thinking about. 

01:50:40
AMY Well, one of the points in the book was that like umm… like making these changes, makes me feel like everything is falling apart and that's really hard for me to deal with because I'm like, well, like I said last time, you know, I'm a control freak with things and it's really hard for me not to about make sure everybody is doing things a certain way or I'm not doing things a certain way and I feel like, if I don't do that, then things are not gonna be done right and it's not so much that, it's not even like the whole dishwashing thing. It's just like my whole world in general is just like collapse and I know that it won't but it doesn't make that feeling go away like… 

01:51:20
MARTIN ANTONY It feels like in the moment. 

01:51:20
AMY Yeah and that's what creates like an anxiety attack. Sort of panic attack where everyone calm is just, I can't breathe and I just start shaking real bad and umm… so I just, you know, and I am having more problems sleeping because I keep thinking about all the things that I need to work on and then you know thinking about changing those things makes me nervous and anxious and you know. 

01:51:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:51:45
AMY So… 

01:51:45
MARTIN ANTONY So how are you dealing with those feelings? 

01:51:50
AMY Umm… not well, like I'll get up at middle of the night and not well. Like I'll get up in the middle of the night and go downstairs and I guess, I get more homework done at I've been reading more for like these classes but umm… and like with the dishwashers, I have been able to let go of that and I'm fine with it. That's. 

01:52:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, I was gonna ask you about that. So I will ask you about that in just a moment. What about this general feeling like things are falling apart? So it sounds like that same anxieties. 

01:52:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:52:10
MARTIN ANTONY Sounds like that's something you read in a book that might happened. 

01:52:15
AMY Yeah. 

01:52:15
MARTIN ANTONY The anxiety will go up before it's down. 

01:52:15
AMY And I read about that after it happened so when I was reading like oh, all right, well this is known for this to be, to be feeling this way and to having these reactions and stuff. Umm… 

01:52:25
MARTIN ANTONY Do you believe, it will get better? 

01:52:30
AMY Well, I guess like with the whole bridge thing that you read off, whereas time, you know, with time that will go away. Although, I was forced to go over that bridge everyday or twice a day. You know, like there is no other way to get to work other than to go over the bridge and like these things, it's like all right, you know, you told me that we'll work on this, I'm just gonna let it go and then the next day, I go right back to doing things the way it was, you know. 

01:52:50
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:52:55
AMY Without even thinking and then afterwards, I realized like oh my God, it's supposed to relax about that or not do it and then, you know, I try to keep up with it and like no one is there like forcing me to do it. 

01:53:05
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:53:05
AMY It's hard. 

01:53:10
MARTIN ANTONY So it takes more, more of a decision from you to. 

01:53:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:53:10
MARTIN ANTONY To do it. 

01:53:15
AMY Yeah, it's like a conscious effort that I have to make to, you know. 

01:53:15
MARTIN ANTONY Pay more attention whereas with the bridge, the bridge was there and it was just automatic, you had to go that way and umm… okay. Umm… but the, the feeling that you got, that panicky feeling, was it similar to the panicky feeling you get on the bridge. 

01:53:25
AMY Yeah. 

01:53:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:53:30
AMY You did see that get, get easy over time. 

01:53:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Okay umm… you should, I mean there is no reason to think that the same thing won't happen with this. It may take a little bit longer because this is, the bridge is a very focused situation. It just, it was a specific bridge, you're going over everyday. This is a more generalized uh… sort of personality style in a way, is there is a lot of different situations and so they may take a little bit longer than, than you start to notice changes in a couple of weeks with the bridge. 

01:54:00
AMY Right. 

01:54:00
MARTIN ANTONY You know, some changes in, in a few weeks with this but there is more sort of variety of things that you're working on. So it may take a little while to. 

01:54:05
AMY Okay. 

01:54:10
MARTIN ANTONY To come down. Umm… well tell me about the dishwasher because that was one that you were umm… a little bit concerned about umm… so you started doing that. So you let your husband load the dishwasher. 

01:54:20
AMY Yeah. 

01:54:20
MARTIN ANTONY And you didn't go back and… 

01:54:20
AMY No. 

01:54:25
MARTIN ANTONY Do stuff uh… fix it up. 

01:54:25
AMY Actually, I would even put things in it like after him, like if I was finished with my water or whatever, I go and put my glass in without like, you know, it will bother me a little bit because I'm like oh, you know, you could do this a different way but I just, you know, made that conscious effort to just put my glass in there and walk away and I will focus on something else like I would make sure that I would focus on something else right away. So when like just keep eating that meal, you know. 

01:54:50
MARTIN ANTONY So would you just go about your business basically or would you actually find extra things to do to distract yourself? 

01:54:55
AMY No, like I would, I would start doing puzzles with my kids. 

01:54:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:55:00
AMY You know, like have like constructive time with them or whatever. 

01:55:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, those things that you might have done anyway. 

01:55:00
AMY Right. 

01:55:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… okay so that's good and, and the umm… and what, so how was it the first time? 

01:55:10
AMY Actually, it was fine. 

01:55:10
MARTIN ANTONY Even the first time. 

01:55:15
AMY Yeah. Like I didn't have any like you know, it kind of like annoyed me, not annoyed, I don't know what the right word is but like, you know. 

01:55:20
MARTIN ANTONY Just feeling that things are not right. 

01:55:20
AMY Well, I was just like, you know, he just doesn't do it right and then, you know, I just close the dishwasher and walked away and you know, got one of my kids to sit down with me and we started doing puzzles and so I was, I was fine with it, you know, I was just like, you know, that, that took, I just, I think I made, it made realize that me doing something that meaningless to change rearrange the dishes in the dishwasher took ten minutes out of my time that I could be spending doing something fun with my girls. 

01:55:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:55:50
AMY So, you know. 

01:55:55
MARTIN ANTONY Great. So uh… so and that continue to be fine throughout the weeks. 

01:55:55
AMY Yeah, well there was only one time that I rearranged it. 

01:55:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:56:00
AMY But just because we had a lot of dishes. 

01:56:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Okay, so that's uh… and in the past, you would have done it everyday pretty much. 

01:56:05
AMY Oh, yeah. 

01:56:05
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so that's, that's great. 

01:56:10
AMY He even start putting the dishes in the dishwasher because he, his whole view is why should I waste my time putting them in there if you're gonna come right back and redo it all. So… 

01:56:15
MARTIN ANTONY So he started again this week, these last couple of weeks. 

01:56:20
AMY Yeah. 

01:56:20
MARTIN ANTONY And was he, did he make any comments about the change? 

01:56:25
AMY Umm… no, not really. He knows like that, that was one of my homework assignments, you know, so I told him, I was like just so you know, I want you to do dishes, you know and he's like, really, you know, not that he was upset that he had to do it but he was just surprised that I was able to let go of it. He didn't really make any comments either way. He just did it and, you know. 

01:56:40
MARTIN ANTONY Has he made any comments about this whole thing that you're doing? 

01:56:45
AMY He's a little surprised about the books. 

01:56:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So. 

01:56:50
AMY So. Umm… like… 

01:56:50
MARTIN ANTONY Surprised in a good way or, or, okay. 

01:56:50
AMY Yeah. He was just shocked that I was able to let go of, of that more so than the dishwasher thing, so. 

01:57:00
MARTIN ANTONY Let me ask you about the books. So you say, you are a little concerned about the books as well. You said that uh… if your husband puts them out of order, it would be easier. If you have to do it, it's gonna be difficult umm… that you said that, so you did it. 

01:57:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:57:10
MARTIN ANTONY And how was that for you? 

01:57:15
AMY It was fine. My daughter noticed it though, who is three which, you know, she's like mom, where is, you know, where is the animal book and I like pointed out to it, she's like, oh, it doesn't go there, it goes here. And that was just one other little thing to like, to kind of like smack me around. It says, you have to stop doing this because look at what, how particular she is. Not only is she particular just because she's like it's a genetic thing that she's particular like I am and my dad is and such or if she's learning it because she sees, you know, so I don't know. I don't want her to, I don't want her to feel like it has to be. 

01:57:45
MARTIN ANTONY It has to be a certain. 

01:57:45
AMY A certain way. 

01:57:45
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:57:45
AMY Or she'll get in trouble. Like, you know, and I don't yell at him for that. I just move it. 

01:57:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

01:57:50
AMY Or I would. 

01:57:50
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:57:50
AMY So. 

01:57:55
MARTIN ANTONY So, uh… it wasn't as difficult for you as you thought it would be, okay. Sounds great. 

01:57:55
AMY No. 

01:58:00
MARTIN ANTONY So you're umm… uh… you're finding that, that these things that we talked about doing are not as difficult but it sounds like some other things are causing problems for you because you are staying up at night and… 

01:58:10
AMY Yeah. 

01:58:10
MARTIN ANTONY Not sleeping and more anxious and uh… what are the things that you've been doing that, that have been more difficult? 

01:58:20
AMY Umm… I don't know and I don't know if it's just, I'm not sure because I've been able to like let go of those few little things and it hasn't been that out and when we put the girls down for bed, you know, we'll go downstairs and my husband will relax and I'll start on homework and then 15 minutes later, he'll get up and clean and I've been able to be okay with that. You know, I've been able to focus decently, I guess on my school work after umm… when there are still toys every where but umm… I don't know what it is that, I don't know, if it's just knowing that I'm letting go of those few things like I'm afraid that I'm gonna let go of everything like everything just gonna fall apart. Like I'm afraid that I'm gonna get lazy about everything. 

01:59:05
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

01:59:05
AMY And I'm not gonna want to do anything or I don't know. 

01:59:10
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Any evidence of that might happen or you ever have an experience like that or? 

01:59:15
AMY No. 

01:59:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

01:59:15
AMY Not that I can think of. Like other things and that kind of just falls apart. No. 

01:59:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so there is nothing. 

01:59:25
AMY That supports it. No. 

01:59:30
MARTIN ANTONY Or feeling that you have. 

01:59:30
AMY Yeah. 

01:59:30
MARTIN ANTONY No evidence of that what happened. 

01:59:30
AMY Right. 

01:59:35
MARTIN ANTONY Umm… so when you're lying in bed not able to sleep what are you thinking about? 

01:59:40
AMY Umm… mostly how I'm fair at everything, like all my little things umm… I'm doing. I mean, then I like having my play. I do better under pressure, which I think most people do. Umm… you know, when I'm on my playwright, I feel like hey, I have to get things done then and there otherwise, I'll just and I'll just let it go. 

02:00:00
MARTIN ANTONY Right. 

02:00:05
AMY But you know like he is doing my schedules in my head you know, like okay, well this is what I have to do for school and this is what I have to do for work and this is my daughter's schedule for the next couple of days. So how I'm gonna do this and go there and get all these little things in, you know and… 

02:00:20
MARTIN ANTONY Were you worrying more about the things you normally do or… 

02:00:20
AMY Yeah. 

02:00:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So. 

02:00:20
AMY And I don't know, I don't know, if it has anything to do with letting go of something already that I feel like if, I don't know. 

02:00:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so maybe it's related to this but then also just maybe, do you sometimes have days like that where you don't sleep as well. 

02:00:35
AMY Yeah. It's just been more frequent. 

02:00:35
MARTIN ANTONY The last couple of weeks. 

02:00:35
AMY Yeah. 

02:00:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… okay, that's something we should watch, you know, because if it is related to this, it should get better. 

02:00:40
AMY Okay. 

02:00:45
MARTIN ANTONY We find umm… even from working with somebody who afraid of something very specific like snakes, you know, if we start looking at pictures of snakes and live snakes and things then, what they often find is that uh… just generally even more stressed out so like this maybe in the back of their mind. They are thinking about the work that they're doing on the snake phobia and you know they just generally things become more irritable and more stressed out. Maybe can't sleep as sound. So it maybe related to this. It may also just be part of your normal sort of sometimes getting stressed out, especially at the end of the semester, I don't know if it's more assignments coming up and that sort of thing. Okay, so we definitely keep an eye on it. Umm… so tell me about the discussion with your friend. 

02:01:30
AMY Umm… well, we are gonna, we are going out on a Saturday night to meet some college friends that we haven't seen since college and I had a feeling like you know once we are going out for drinks and foods. So I knew, once I started drinking that I would probably end up telling her anyways. So I wanted to tell her when I hadn't been drinking and, and, and have control of the situation and let her know what I felt comfortable with her knowing and we just, I just talked about everything. I kind of explained this whole process and how this works and umm… I kind of apologized for the way I've been treating her lately and how I really wanted it to work on it and that's one of the things that I brought up in the therapy session and you know, I told her, I said, you know, you know, I feel like, we've been treating each other when junior high and I've never done that with her before or never done like that before and umm… she does me know me and she's very important to me and my kids and my family and umm… I don't want my behaviors towards her, my anger or frustration or whatever it might be or the control thing, I'm not sure but I don't want that to like ruin anything and you know she had her, you know reasons why she thought that I was behavioring in a certain way and, you know, we kind of like just talked about everything and it was, it was really good and she's been asking me more and more on a daily basis likes how are things going, you know and I feel comfortable talking to her again. 

02:02:55
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:02:55
AMY Like for a long time, I wouldn't tell her anything that was going on because I was afraid that she would thrive on me feeling if I would have failed or umm… you mow, I had a hard time showing people like my weaknesses and most people, I would think would but I feel like, you know, if people know that, you know, I'm discussing things with either like, oh, she can't deal with that on her own. 

02:03:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:03:25
AMY You know and that's really, really hard for me to accept. But I can't deal with things. 

02:03:30
MARTIN ANTONY So you mentioned earlier that two of you were treating each like junior high students might treat one another. How has she been with, she been similar with you in terms of… 

02:03:40
AMY Yeah, she hasn't been talking to me as much. I mean like we talk on the phone. But it wouldn't be like about really anything and umm… 

02:03:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Is she been critical with you in the same way that you are with her? 

02:03:50
AMY Yeah. She will get like snippy with me about things or umm… that kind of thing and some of the papers, I have to write for school are pretty personal and she's like oh she's like, I would love to read that. And I think that's kind of weird that she wants to like know my faults because that's what it's about. It's like faulty thinking and whatever and she's, you know, the fact that she wants to like, I felt like, like in a way that she wanted to use that against me like if we were to get in a fight that she would, I don't know and then she also brought up to me the reason why she's kind of pulled away is that she thinks that if she's having a problem in her life and she talks to me about it, then because I'm in school for counseling, that I'm gonna over analyze everything and tell her that, you know, oh, you should do that or you should do this or your life is falling apart or whatever the case maybe. 

02:04:35
MARTIN ANTONY So she's worried about being judged by you. 

02:04:35
AMY Judged by me and I was the same way with her. 

02:04:35
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:04:40
AMY So it was a lot of miscommunication going on and a lot of you know assumptions that were very off and me talking to her about it just it really create the air and I feel so much better and or much more comfortable again with each other. 

02:04:55
MARTIN ANTONY Great. 

02:05:00
AMY So that's really good. So I think, I just needed to talk to her. To settle that. So but. 

02:05:10
MARTIN ANTONY Great and uh… that's early in terms of as you work on the perfectionism being more aware of those behaviors and trying to sort of stop them before they, before they happened uh… something you can add to the sort of things that you're practicing and working on umm… as you go along. So umm… but you may find that just speaking in a more open way, the way that you did will, will sort of get rid of that. 

02:05:30
AMY Yeah. 

02:05:35
MARTIN ANTONY Anyway, umm… so if it's coming from a uh… umm… you know, we talked about last time but their sort of perfectionism coming from a place of feeling vulnerable or, or endangered in some way that you need to protect yourself and maintain control or whatever then umm… just having the relationship be more open and comfortable in itself may get rid of that need to, to control the same way maybe so. Good. Okay, so let's umm…, let's talk about the thought record. So you, you umm… I'm just gonna pull out a blank copy and maybe we can work through umm… one of the examples that came up over the past weeks. So the past couple of weeks. So what was the uh… maybe the biggest situations that came up for you in terms of anxiety or that need to have things a certain way? 

02:06:25
AMY Umm… okay, let me get my paper. I have a picture in my head. Umm… one of the things that came up is umm… my husband's grandmother is very ill and my husband is been working a lot lately because his boss has been out of commission and umm… we thought that we might have to travel to go to like a waking in funeral and stuff. And like all the things that I had to do like to get prepared for it or is very overwhelming for me. 

02:06:50
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:06:50
AMY Umm… because I had to make sure that like schoolwork was done way ahead of time then and I had to get stuff ready, you know, umm… for the, for the wake and the funeral and I was gonna have to help with some of the arrangements, even though I'm way far away you know. 

02:07:10
MARTIN ANTONY Where, where does your Grandma live. 

02:07:10
AMY Iowa. 

02:07:10
MARTIN ANTONY Iowa, okay. What was her current situation? 

02:07:15
AMY Umm… actually she's doing. 

02:07:15
MARTIN ANTONY Better. 

02:07:20
AMY Better. She fell and broke her hip and when they did the surgery, she never woke up from the anaesthesia. And then she woke up but I guess she's not well enough yet to because then all of a sudden like a week later, his aunt made some comment about you know, oh mom is going to the nursing home and I'm like when did she wake up? And so they didn't get and that was the thing that bothered me the most is like his mom called us in this like dire strait, you know, Grandma is sick, she's not waking up, you know, it's a matter of days and then we didn't hear anything, then hear anything and then we hear from an aunt that she's fine or not fine but you know, death wasn't imminent, you know and we didn't get that. So like me and my husband were you know, he was stressed out because of he couldn't leave work. There was no way that he could leave without his boss coming back and so he was stressed out and then so I was trying to pick up the pieces on the other end of it. And then we weren't informed. So I was like angry with his mom when I'm sure, she had, I mean, she obviously had stuff going on because it's her mom, you know, but I was, you know, angry with her about that and you know, I guess it would be with her a little bit, have a hard time just taking a deep breath and thinking about it from her situation. 

02:08:30
MARTIN ANTONY So that's a good description of the situation. So you're umm…, your mood in that situation was anger. Any other, any other uh… sort of emotions that you were aware of? 

02:08:40
AMY Just frustrated. 

02:08:40
MARTIN ANTONY Frustration. Okay and your thoughts, your sort of negative automatic thoughts in this situation. 

02:08:50
AMY You know, umm… one of my thoughts was that, you know, you can call me when it's so bad but then when things are getting better, you can't just let us know like, I mean, she called so upset which I totally understand, you know and then once things get better, we were never, she never told us and her, two other sons live far far away like Oregon and California, you know, she didn't let them know either and they were making arrangements to try to get back home and… 

02:09:15
MARTIN ANTONY So the thought that she was inconsiderate or something like that umm… okay any other thoughts that umm… contributed to that? 

02:09:30
AMY Umm… I don't think I have anything else down. 

02:09:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Any thoughts about umm… about yourself and how she uh… meaning of her behavior, she doesn't care about you guys or… 

02:09:50
AMY Oh, I thought, she was kind of being, it may sound awful because it was her mom that was gonna die. So it sounds so mean. I just felt like she is a little selfish like you know and I understood that you know everything, I try to understand like everything that she was going through and you know her brother and sister came into town from out of town to be there with her and her mom and stuff but you know. 

02:10:15
MARTIN ANTONY So you thought did you feel like you deserved to be treated better than… 

02:10:15
AMY Yeah. I think, she kind of neglected the outside family a little bit just informational wise, you know. 

02:10:25
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Umm… and the, the evidence that supports that thought. 

02:10:30
AMY The fact that she didn't call us to kind of inform us about how things were going or she didn't keep us updated. 

02:10:40
MARTIN ANTONY So she didn't call, that's one. And what evidence do you have or, or that, that was a sign of her being inconsiderate or selfish? 

02:10:50
AMY Umm… 

02:10:55
MARTIN ANTONY For example, uh… if you think of how you would be in that situation would you have been different? 

02:11:00
AMY I don't know, I think I would have called everybody, I'm okay, I just want to let you know Grandma is actually, you know, coming out of this. It's great. 

02:11:05
MARTIN ANTONY So I would have called. 

02:11:05
AMY Yeah. 

02:11:10
MARTIN ANTONY Any other evidence that, that her response was inconsiderate or selfish? 

02:11:15
AMY Umm… just the fact that I know, I would have, I would call someone. 

02:11:15
MARTIN ANTONY What about your husband? Will he feel the same way? 

02:11:20
AMY Yeah, he was kind of perturbed. 

02:11:20
MARTIN ANTONY So husband basically agreed. So you had some uh… support for that view. 

02:11:25
AMY Yeah, I, I get a lot of support from him when his mom gets on us. 

02:11:30
MARTIN ANTONY Did you talk to other people on the family, who didn't get caught? 

02:11:30
AMY Oh umm… yeah, I talked to his brother, my husband's brother. 

02:11:35
MARTIN ANTONY How did he feel about it? 

02:11:35
AMY Umm… he was very upset. 

02:11:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:11:40
AMY You know. 

02:11:40
MARTIN ANTONY So more support for that view. 

02:11:40
AMY Yeah. 

02:11:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:11:40
AMY And the other brother, I didn't talk to so, I don't know how he felt. 

02:11:45
MARTIN ANTONY Okay and what if we looked at evidence that doesn't support that, that thoughts. The thought was that she's inconsiderate, selfish and deserve better. Any reason? 

02:11:55
AMY She had a lot going on. She had to do nursing home placement, you know she had a contact to find her nursing home that she thought would be you know suitable for her mother to go to and you know, she had to go and clean up the house and maybe get ready, get it ready to sell. Umm… she might have had things going on with like, you know pre-funeral stuff, I don't know. 

02:12:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:12:15
AMY But, I mean… 

02:12:20
MARTIN ANTONY There are a lots of things. 

02:12:20
AMY Yeah, there is a lot of things and she's also in grad school herself and she's finishing up this in may, so she had to cancel miss classes and miss work and so obviously, she had a lot going on. So… 

02:12:30
MARTIN ANTONY If you had all those things going on would you still find a way to call? 

02:12:35
AMY Oh, yeah, I would have called still. 

02:12:35
MARTIN ANTONY So how can you reconcile that umm… 

02:12:40
AMY I don't know, I just deal with situations the same way and I need to remember that, that just because I would do something a certain way. 

02:12:45
MARTIN ANTONY It doesn't mean everybody else could have done that necessarily. 

02:12:45
AMY Yeah. 

02:12:50
MARTIN ANTONY So she isn't you basically. 

02:12:50
AMY Right. 

02:12:50
MARTIN ANTONY She, for her uh… dealing with these things might, might have been all she could have dealt with or as maybe you would have been able to do with more different things in that situation perhaps so, okay, I'll just put she, she isn't me as a, okay. And when you uh… so if you, if you come to a more balanced thought umm… so the original thought was that she's being inconsiderate and selfish uh… deserve to be treated better, you've got evidence for that. Well, first of all she didn't call. I would have called, my husband agrees with me. My husband's brother agrees. Umm… and yet uh… the evidence that wasn't of selfishness was that she had a lot of things to take care of that maybe for her were more than she could handle. 

02:13:40
AMY Right, she had to prioritize things a little differently. 

02:13:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. Yeah, okay. So if you, if you try to have a more balanced thought in that situation, how would you, first of all would you change your original thought? 

02:13:50
AMY Well, I think, I would have still then, you know, like I would never say anything to her like why didn't you call, you know, because I just think that's rude but umm… I don't know umm… 

02:14:05
MARTIN ANTONY Well how, first of all at the beginning, how strongly did you believe that? 

02:14:10
AMY Oh, I was, I was pissed. So 100% or 90% or… 

02:14:15
MARTIN ANTONY Probably close to like 85, I guess. 

02:14:15
AMY 85%. After you went through this exercise, if you go back to that initial thought, how strongly did you believe it? Umm… like just thinking back to kind of thing. 

02:14:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. She's inconsiderate, selfish, I deserve to be treated better. 

02:14:30
AMY Probably like 30. 

02:14:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:14:30
AMY Just because I think it sounds kind of harsh. The fact that I think I should be treated better when she's the one who's dealing with the emotional stress of her mom being in a coma, you know, like maybe in a way I was being selfish thinking that she should, I don't know, I mean, it's, my husband's grandmother too, so you know, he should have been informed but… 

02:14:50
MARTIN ANTONY So still that belief is still there but not as strong as it was at the beginning and how could you think about the situation in a more uh… how would you think about the situation after you've gone through this exercise? So the initial thought was she's inconsiderate and selfish, what's the new thought? 

02:15:05
AMY Umm… basically that you know, well Nancy has a lot going on and you know, she has family in town and she has a lot of things to deal with and you know. Maybe that was like on her to do list, it just wasn't done yet. 

02:15:20
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:15:20
AMY And maybe his aunt just beat her to that, you know, that little check on her to do list or mental whatever, you know. 

02:15:30
MARTIN ANTONY And how did that change your anger level? 

02:15:30
AMY Oh, it was gone. 

02:15:30
MARTIN ANTONY It was gone. 

02:15:30
AMY Yeah. 

02:15:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so you are still a little bit angry at her or? 

02:15:35
AMY No, not angry at her no. I just, he's gone. 

02:15:40
MARTIN ANTONY okay. So umm… now did it, did, so did you actually when you filled out the form, did you come up with these similar kinds of arguments and did you find that they are actually made a difference in terms of your mood or… 

02:15:50
AMY Yeah, because it wasn't until, I was filling this out that I stopped being annoyed. 

02:15:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:15:55
AMY Or angry or frustrated. So yeah, like I was filling it out and like wait a second, you know, I have to look at it just from a different point of view and not just how I'm feeling or what I'm going through or how I'm perceiving things because obviously, I'm not the only one involved in this situation. 

02:16:10
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:16:10
AMY So. 

02:16:10
MARTIN ANTONY And this is, this is actually a good one because it's a little complicated. It's not umm… yeah, with the bridge, it's, it's more straight forward, you know, basically people don't go flying off bridges generally. They don't generally collapse. 

02:16:25
AMY Are you trying to make me scared of them again? 

02:16:25
MARTIN ANTONY No, no, no. Umm… 

02:16:30
AMY Because I have to go over one to get back home tonight. 

02:16:30
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, we'll talk about but how about snakes? 

02:16:35
AMY Snakes are fine. 

02:16:35
MARTIN ANTONY So let's talk about snakes then. When people have snake phobias of harmless snakes it's more of an irrational thought umm… this is not, it sounds like, this is not irrational. In fact, almost everyone involved in this have that same kind of feeling, your brother did, your husband did umm… 

02:16:50
AMY I just feel bad getting angry at someone when they are going through something like that, like why, like that's frustrating and then I get mad at myself for being in, you know. 

02:17:00
MARTIN ANTONY But, but it sounds like your response wasn't unusual response. It sounds like it's a response that other people might have. It doesn't mean that it's, it's a completely accurate or, or thoughtful response to have and your response as, as you went through this, this exercise but umm… uh… you didn't go from 85 to zero, you went to 30, you know, so, so and I think that in that way, it's a, it's a nice uh… short of example of an exercise that umm… first using this exercise for a situation that's sort of complicated, it's hard to know uh… what's, what's right and uh… you know, wrong and it's, it's messy in a way. Umm… so in a way, I think, I think, you've dealt with it very well. Umm… the other thing that I would uh… want to point out with this is, this kind of exercise is useful for dealing with situations where umm… your thoughts are exaggerated or, or biased in a way umm… or you know, completely unrealistic. You may have other situations where umm… where you should be angry or you should be sad or you should be uh… scared and, and the thoughts are realistic and in those cases, umm… trying to, you know, going through this exercise, you might discover wait a second, actually this does make sense and I'm anxious in this situation and in those situations uh… dealing with things uh… there are other strategies that you can use to deal with the anxiety rather than umm… uh… this sort of a strategy and particular problem solving. So for example, if you uh… if you are terrified getting fired from a job, but there is no evidence, you can get fired and the risk of getting fired is actually very low, in that case, trying to change your thoughts would be appropriate. 

02:18:40
AMY Okay. 

02:18:40
MARTIN ANTONY On the other hand, if you are terrified of getting fired from a job and there is actually really high chance of getting fired, you have been warned three times and you just made the same mistake again uh… that you're warned about before and in those cases, then umm… trying to convince yourself that you're not gonna be fired might not be the way to go uh… on the other hand trying to solve that problem, you know, like talking to your boss or looking for another job or whatever it is you need to do would be, would be more appropriate. So just want to point out that for realistic thoughts this may not be necessarily the, the approach to take so. But anyway, that's great. So let's uh… we should begin to talk about the plan for the next couple of weeks because I want to, I want to sort of build on what you've done. So you've got more of these forms umm… that you can uh… continue to, to work on over the next couple of weeks. So that's great. Umm… can you, now the dishwasher is feeling okay. Can you continue that for another couple of weeks? 

02:19:35
AMY Yeah. Yeah. 

02:19:40
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so umm… I continue with the dishwasher and the books. You okay just leaving them the way they are for now or…? 

02:19:50
AMY Kind of, but… Umm… Well, because I was… I was telling my daughter when she was asking where the animal book was, you know, it was over here and she told me that it doesn't go here. We're gonna try a new way to do it. So now, we are doing it by size. So I'm not really changing the behavior. You know, but like in the beginning, I was just like, just putting them away on, in her bookshelf, you know, and I didn't care. But when she was just like mommy, it doesn't go here, I was trying to tell her that the reason why we are changing it was to try something new, like before she had a line up As and Bs and Cs and now I'm trying. So I'm… I'm using the excuse that I'm teaching her about size now versus… So I guess, that's… 

02:20:25
MARTIN ANTONY Well, it's still umm… 

02:20:30
AMY But it's still that behavior. 

02:20:30
MARTIN ANTONY It's still.. It's still the, you know the… the same basic belief is behind that, that the books have to be organized according to some uh… rule. 

02:20:35
AMY Right. 

02:20:40
MARTIN ANTONY Basically which… And there's nothing bad about organization, you know, so I have, you know, in my bookshelf I have books on certain topics together just because, you know… 

02:20:50
AMY Easier to find. 

02:20:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, there are lots of books so it's easier to find them if I… if I find them where they are. So the message isn't that you should never be organized or things shouldn't be in order. On the other hand, if it's anxiety provoking to have things out of order, umm… for at least a short period of maybe worth having things out of order. One option I'm thinking with you, your daughter is umm… you could also teach her the message that, you know, sometimes it's helpful to have things out of order but it's also okay to have, it's helpful to have things in order but it's also okay sometimes to you know have things in different orders or do things differently. And why don't you put the books the way you'd like to have them and… and just leave them in their hands even. 

02:21:25
AMY I could do that. 

02:21:25
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:21:30
AMY Yeah, I can do that. And I think just now you said something that maybe think why I feel like my whole world is gonna fall apart is because I'm afraid that, like, if I like go like this organizing her books, then I just feel like I stop organizing like everything and I'm, I'm a huge, like controlling and organizing and all that kind of stuff, like, like just thinking about it now is just like… 

02:21:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay, so let's treat that as a prediction. So I will stop organizing everything if I, if I stop… If I stop organizing some thing, they will stop organizing everything. And how… how do you imagine that happening? Well, you just… You just wake up one day and you will be in an unorganized… 

02:22:10
AMY No, I think it will be a slow thing. 

02:22:10
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:22:10
AMY Like, you know, I'll be able to like go of things here and there and then when I realized how easy it was to let go of the dishwasher situation and to like go to the books. You know, then I might think… You know, what? It's gonna just be easier if I just stopped doing this too. Or it's gonna be easier if I just let go of this and then I feel like my whole family is gonna fall apart, like, not, they are not gonna feel the pick up pieces here and there. 

02:22:35
MARTIN ANTONY So what do you imagine yourself doing just… If that… If that were to happen, what would you be doing? Would you be just lying on the couch or… 

02:22:40
AMY Yeah. 

02:22:40
MARTIN ANTONY So you imagine… 

02:22:45
AMY Like being, like just a lazy couch potato or not doing anything with my time or like… 

02:22:50
MARTIN ANTONY So what can you do with that thought? 

02:22:50
AMY I don't know. 

02:22:55
MARTIN ANTONY If we think of uh… evidence in support of that thought. 

02:22:55
AMY Umm… Well, I'm gonna blame your book. 

02:22:55
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:23:00
AMY Because in the book, there's an example of somebody who umm… was a very, very clean person and but you mentioned that, when you went into his house, you would never know it because he was so scared that if he started cleaning, that it would never stop, like it would become such an obsession with him again. You know, so he just didn't clean anything. And so then I'm sitting… Oh, it's like having with me, you know, organizing things and scheduling things and planning, you know. I have a trip to California this summer and it's six months away and my mom and I are already planning every little thing we're going to do every single day, you know. And that's something, it's fun because we are excited about going but, you know, at the same time, I'm scared that I'm gonna like lose any enjoyment I get out of planning things or scheduling things or you know… 

02:23:50
MARTIN ANTONY So if you were your therapist, how would you respond to that? 

02:23:55
AMY I'd smack me probably. 

02:23:55
MARTIN ANTONY I don't know how to do that so… But uh… what would your second, second choice would be? 

02:24:05
AMY Umm… I don't know. Because I know that… I don't know. Well, I don't know. Umm… 

02:24:10
MARTIN ANTONY Say… say the roles are reversed so I'm, I'm having a thought, so I'm, I'm uh… generally very organized uh… I want to cut down on that because I spend too much time doing it but I'm afraid if I do that I'll like it so much that I'll just let go of everything, family will fall apart. How do you respond to that? 

02:24:30
AMY I haven't been trained yet. 

02:24:35
MARTIN ANTONY Well, try to think like somebody who isn't a perfectionist. So try to think like your husband, you said, he's not a perfectionist. 

02:24:40
AMY No, he's not. 

02:24:40
MARTIN ANTONY How would he… How would he have… What would he think about that? 

02:24:45
AMY I don't know because he just doesn't see how… Like, he doesn't see things the way I look at them. So he would just be like, just because you do that, it doesn't mean the world is gonna fall apart. You know, like things will still get done because he's like if you leave the house messy enough, I'll clean it. 

02:25:05
MARTIN ANTONY But I hear you say that everything will fall apart. You sound as if you're talking about yourself as someone who has no control in the situation. You're not actually making decisions. Everything sort of on autopilot and you do what you have to do and don't really think about it. And if stop doing that, everything will just fall apart. I mean, one way of thinking about this is like, you actually have the, the choice to make decisions about what you're gonna change and what you're not gonna change. You actually probably have a lot more umm… You'll actually have more control than you have now because right now you, in a way you've you uh… don't have control because you're driven by the need to do things in a certain way. You're actually be in a position to make decisions about what you want to be controlling about and what you don't want to be controlling about. One of the things, the book talks about is that the goal of the book isn't to get rid of all the high standards that people have or all perfectionism but only the… the aspects of it that are interfering with your life. It's a whole lot of stuff you do that's great that you want to, probably want to instill those values in your children and you know, you want, you want to hold on to those behaviors. So umm… part of this will be trying to figure out which of these things are getting in the way and taking too must time and, and are uh… excessive and which of these things are behaviors that you… you probably do want to hold on to. Umm… does that, does that ring true for you or… 

02:26:25
AMY Yeah, I'm poor in decision making, so maybe this will help, right? Like choosing what to let go and what not to. 

02:26:35
MARTIN ANTONY Is there a fear that if she let go of the wrong thing, something terrible will happen? 

02:26:40
AMY Yeah. 

02:26:40
MARTIN ANTONY Then, then what? 

02:26:40
AMY I'm just scared that, I'm not gonna know which ones I should, you know, give not uh… give up but I mean… 

02:26:50
MARTIN ANTONY What will happen if you pick the wrong thing? 

02:26:55
AMY My husband know what to do with me. Umm… 

02:27:00
MARTIN ANTONY Will it be an uncorrectable problem? 

02:27:00
AMY No. 

02:27:00
MARTIN ANTONY You always… You always start being… You will always reorganize something right? okay. 

02:27:05
AMY Right, right. 

02:27:05
MARTIN ANTONY Any long term risks of picking the wrong thing? 

02:27:10
AMY You mean, like if I continued with it? 

02:27:10
MARTIN ANTONY Let's say, you decide that I'm gonna… I'm going to let go of the uh… Well, one thing we talked about is the… the diapers, that you always pack that diaper bag, yeah. So… 

02:27:20
AMY I haven't done. I haven't worked on that about… 

02:27:25
MARTIN ANTONY So say you decide to work on that and it just doesn't work out. Your husband just never learns how to do it. Are you stuck for life with this situation? 

02:27:30
AMY No, I can go. I can help him out again. 

02:27:35
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. Okay, so… so one way of thinking about it is that, for the kinds of things that we're talking about, there are no parts of this that are really uncorrectable or you know, that… that you couldn't go back to, if it ended up being a wrong decision? 

02:27:45
AMY Right. 

02:27:50
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah umm… And would you know if it's a wrong decision? 

02:27:50
AMY I would think so. I mean… 

02:27:55
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, if something bad happens or… Yeah. 

02:27:55
AMY Yeah. I think I would pick up on that. 

02:28:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:28:00
AMY I hope, I would. 

02:28:00
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. So the biggest risk then of trying these things is what for now? 

02:28:10
AMY Just getting lazy about everything that… Like, I'm really afraid that I'm just gonna, you know… 

02:28:15
MARTIN ANTONY So how can we… So one possibility is that you'll, you'll get lazy and everything will fall apart. Another possibility is that, that won't happen. How can we find out whether uh… 

02:28:25
AMY Whether it will happen or not? 

02:28:25
MARTIN ANTONY Whether it will happen or not. 

02:28:30
AMY Well, I know, well, because just for the fact that I'm in school and I can't, not try to do well in school. So that I would… 

02:28:40
MARTIN ANTONY So there are aspects of your life that are important enough that you trust yourself not to just stop studying or neglecting your children, or there are things that are important to you, you have a sense that you will continue doing these things? 

02:28:50
AMY Yeah, but like the weekend thing. You know, how I told you in the very first session how I have an entire list of all the weekends for the whole entire year, 2007. Well, I canceled plans for a couple of weekends ago and my husband and I did absolutely nothing and it was awesome. 

02:29:05
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah. 

02:29:05
AMY It was great. It was… I haven't been that relaxed since so long. 

02:29:05
MARTIN ANTONY Great. 

02:29:10
AMY And my husband is like, see, what I'm talking about. You know, and he's always been a good sport because he goes along with whatever I plan and you know, just trying to keep us more busy than he wants to be. And it was just so nice and like, man, I can do this every weekend. But I, but then again, I don't want, you know… And I guess, I could easily fix that by just going okay, well, you know, one week in a month, we should make no plans and just have relaxing family time. We can play outside or we can watch movies or do whatever we want. We don't have to make any decisions and then I can plan the other three weekends, I don't know. 

02:29:40
MARTIN ANTONY Yeah, that's… that's one option. 

02:29:45
AMY I mean, but it was… it was great. 

02:29:45
MARTIN ANTONY And some people may… Some people may do that every weekend and you know, but… but anyway, that's, yeah, that's a decision you can make. The other things, there are a lot of people feel that way when you've done something that, that you've never done before umm… that, you know, just seems so amazing uh… You might find that you actually don't want to do that every weekend. You know, after six or seven weekends of doing that, you'd be, you'd be kind of itching to get out. You know, it reminds me of umm… somebody I was talking to who had retired and he was so excited about retiring because he had worked his whole life and just was ready to retire and he decided, he'd like carving ducks. So he was gonna start carving wooden ducks and umm… uh… he did that and after about his 40th duck, umm… he decided, you know, what I'm kind of tired of being retired. You know, he decided that… that it was a nice break but… but after a while, it wasn't a nice break anymore. He was kind of itching to get back. And I mentioned that you… you may have… I've had that experience certainly after vacation, that it's nice… It's always nice to go away and it's always nice to come back. 

02:30:45
AMY It's better to come back, I think. 

02:30:45
MARTIN ANTONY As well, yeah. So… so that's… That may just be a feeling that you had because of it, so rare for you to do that and it doesn't mean that you necessarily will do it every week, maybe. But again, we could do another experiment we could… we could try. We only have about a minute left. So I really want to iron out some… some plans for the next week. So with the books, one option is turning that over to your daughter and let her decide, so you can organize this anyway you want, you can change them, you can… 

02:31:15
AMY I think, I'll have fun with that. 

02:31:15
MARTIN ANTONY Okay. 

02:31:15
AMY And I'll have fun watching her do that, you know. 

02:31:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. And you can, you can, that can be sold enough now that can be her, her thing. Okay so daughter will organize uh… her own books. And continue with the dishwasher, you can continue with the forms. Umm… anything else that we can add over the coming weeks, something, something that you uh… coming two weeks, something that you could let go of normally you wouldn't rather than just breaking some move or mixing things up a little bit. 

02:31:50
AMY Probably. 

02:31:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Can you think of anything? 

02:31:50
AMY Umm… 

02:31:55
[sil.] 

02:32:00
AMY No, I can't out of top of my head. 

02:32:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Something related to cleaning, something related to studying, something related to activities with your children. 

02:32:15
AMY Umm… 

02:32:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY It doesn't have to be a eliminating things just doing things in a different way even or umm… you want to pick things that are challenging so I'll just throw something out. You do baking right now every Friday. Umm… If you were to do something else on a Friday instead of baking. 

02:32:35
AMY I could do that. I could try that. 

02:32:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Would it be difficult? 

02:32:35
AMY Yeah. 

02:32:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So why don't we… why don't we try that? Umm… 

02:32:40
AMY Which is kind of like substituted with the different activity with her. Because… 

02:32:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY The… the main thing is that you, yeah, I mean, you… you don't want to, I'm not suggesting that you just have her sit around and do nothing and you spend all time with her or whatever if you're both at home but on the other hand, we… we want you to try things that are challenging. If it wouldn't be challenging for you then, then it's not. 

02:33:05
AMY Right. No, it would be. 

02:33:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So try something different than baking on a Friday. It's sort of like if we umm… you know, if somebody is afraid of dogs practicing with dogs that don't frighten them isn't really gonna be useful for them. So we… we want people to try things that are anxiety provoking, difficult. So if… if… if you're fine, you do that and it doesn't bother you then, you know, you don't need to continue doing that. We want to find some things that… that do make you uncomfortable. 

02:33:35
AMY Clean up my husband's car. 

02:33:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Cleaning will make you uncomfortable. 

02:33:40
AMY No. Not cleaning, yeah. 

02:33:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, that's a good one. 

02:33:40
AMY Something that I was like, I can come up with something but I don't want to cope it. 

02:33:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY How often do you clean cars? 

02:33:45
AMY Any time, I get in it, it just drives me crazy. 

02:33:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Can we try again? We don't have to make this a permanent thing but can we try it for two weeks? 

02:33:55
AMY Yeah. 

02:33:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:33:55
AMY I mean, like yesterday, when you picked me up because my car was kind of breaking down on me, you know… you know, got a plastic bag out of my car and start doing like, putting stuff in these like Amy just go, you know and just. 

02:34:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Great. So we need to stop. Is there anything quick that you want to mention before, if you think of other things that's great. Is there anything you'd like to add before we stop? 

02:34:15
AMY Nothing that I can think of. 

02:34:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Great. We have a plan and we'll see you in a couple of weeks. 

02:34:20
AMY Okay. Thanks. 

02:34:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:34:25
JON CARLSON Marty, this is the time when you start to have her begin to disobey you to work at not being so perfect. 

02:34:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yes, so umm… part of the homework is, uh… involves trying to break the rules and do things differently. So uh… children need to have their books in alphabetical order uh… she needs, you know, the homework was too begin to have the books be out of order and one of the things we saw in this session is that her daughter is actually having some trouble with that. So her daughter is saying, you know, mommy, this book is in the wrong place and she some of these of traits in her daughter as well umm… which uh… is for her is a real motivator to… to continue working on the therapy. 

02:35:05
JON CARLSON But you know, in a session she also loots to her husband and some of the problems that happen in relationships because of perfectionism. Can you talk a little bit about that? 

02:35:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, and we never back at the first session, she said that she's only a perfectionist with herself. Other people can do whatever, she's not uh… What we're seeing now is that she actually is a perfectionist uh… towards others as well. So her husband has to load the dishwasher exactly perfectly. Umm… And to maximize these space in the dishwasher and if not she has to go back and redo it all. Well now her homework has been to stop doing that. The other thing that… that has come up over the course of the therapy is that she has a friend who she's, uh… best friend that she's not been getting along with as well recently because of her perfectionistic expectations for friend, having to do things a certain way or say things a certain way and she uh… just recently uh… has had a talk with her friend uh… about this problem, and it seems to have been a very positive experience, their relationship so far anyway seems to have changed for the better now that they, they're friend now is… is a little more understanding where she's coming from, and Amy is now a little bit more willing to let her friend not do things perfectly or say things perfectly. 

02:36:20
JON CARLSON You know, it would seemed to be really important that at some point in the treatment to at least bring her husband in. 

02:36:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Yeah, I think that would be uh… that would be great whether it happens uh… uh… in this treatment or not uh… we'll… we'll see, see what happens but certainly if we had more than six sessions, umm… that's something that uh… that we probably would want to do in one session. 

02:36:40
JON CARLSON Because the more she pursues this perfectionism, the more she pushes other people away? 

02:36:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Or tries to control, yeah she… her husband seems pretty good natured about the whole thing but yeah. 

02:36:50
JON CARLSON So far. 

02:36:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY So far, yeah. Another husband very well might be pushed away by this so. Umm… definitely the very least we want to involve in the treatment is to make sure that he's uh… on board and doing the things that need to be done rather than doing things to reinforce the perfectionism. 

02:37:10
JON CARLSON You know, your work makes this seem simple, I mean, that you have this problem is so complex, it deals with so many different areas. It's pervasive, I guess. 

02:37:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, absolutely, yeah, there is a lot of uh… yeah, this is true. So in… in six sessions, we won't probably won't change everything but if we can make a dent in parts of it and more importantly, if we can teach her to be her own therapist, so that she can continue to use these strategies in a wider range of uh… situations. 

02:37:35
JON CARLSON And to have a more satisfying life. 

02:37:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:37:40
JON CARLSON We're gonna move on to session number four. What are you looking forward to in that session? What are your goals? 

02:37:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Well, one goal is to make sure that we're seeing some games now. So we want to make sure that those uh… games are being maintained. We want to make sure that she's continuing to, to do the homework. Sometimes what we see uh… maybe not this early in therapy but, but at some point in therapy, where people start to make games, they start to umm… get a little bit, their motivation starts to drop off a bit because they are not suffering as much as they were at the beginning. So they become a little less compliant with homework and uh… or you know, other things happen in their life, they get busy. We want to make sure that she's continued to be on track and uh… we want to make sure that she will want to continue to reinforce her use of these strategies. 

02:38:25
JON CARLSON Let's move on to session number four. This is session four of cognitive behavioral therapy for problems of perfectionism. 

02:38:40
Session 4 

02:38:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Hi, Amy. 

02:38:50
AMY Hello. 

02:38:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Welcome back. 

02:38:50
AMY Thank you. 

02:38:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… What I'd like to do is to uh… to catch up on your homework and see how that's going and to see generally how things are and also umm… we're about, we've had three meetings. This is the fourth, we have two more after this. Uh… so I think this is also a good time to review uh… your goals for therapy and where things are at and uh… in what ways you've met your goals and in what ways you need to work on and those sorts of issues. 

02:39:20
AMY Okay. 

02:39:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about? 

02:39:25
AMY Umm… No, I've had a pretty stressful couple of weeks. Umm… Which has increased my anxiety level and I noticed that with the homework I was supposed to be working on, it's harder for me to let go. And I don't know if it's just because of everything that's going on in my life but I just, like feel like that control part of it, like that's the one thing I can control like different things. 

02:39:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY What kinds of things, what's been going on? 

02:39:50
AMY Umm… well I've had a lot of schoolwork lately. Umm… I have like a 20 page research paper due today and like a 15 page final due today. Umm… I have a group presentation tomorrow. Umm… I had a paper last week. I have another paper research paper due next week and then I have two finals and two more papers. 

02:40:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:40:10
AMY So it's just, because it's the end of the term that tends to happen which I… that's fine but it's because that's how I control and I tend to procrastinate until the very last minute to do things. I kind of like get like nitpicky with other things around the house or with close family members and friends and stuff like that. 

02:40:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:40:30
AMY So like the book thing, my daughter's books. 

02:40:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

02:40:30
AMY We had a really hard time just letting go of it. 

02:40:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:40:35
AMY You know, it's one of those things, I'll just do it and get it done with and it's easier and that looks better and you know. 

02:40:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:40:40
AMY So… 

02:40:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY And that was something that was easier before all the stress hit. 

02:40:45
AMY Right. Yeah. 

02:40:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So that's umm… uh… that's gonna (inaudible) working on top of all that. 

02:40:50
AMY Yeah. 

02:40:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY And… Okay. Umm… okay, well, let's, let's begin by then reviewing homework. So I mean that the things that you're planning to do. One was to continue with the dishwasher and not, not reloading the dishwasher. Have you been able to do that? 

02:41:10
AMY Yeah, I have been able to do that. I think that, that's something that I'm, I'm okay with. At times, it gets a little, I don't know what the right term for, I guess bothersome for me like when I put them in a dishwasher, and it's not loaded the way I would load it umm… but I just remember, I just have to let it go and they will still be washed and you know, everything will be fine. 

02:41:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:41:30
AMY You know. 

02:41:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY And why do you think stress has made things harder? Why do you think that happens? 

02:41:40
AMY Umm… I don't know, I just… I don't know if it's a procrastination thing like trying to procrastinate with my schoolwork so instead I'll still clean up the house when my husband wants to rest or whatever. Or if it's because like a control thing. I can't control what's going on at school. I can control by working ahead of time but I don't do. Umm… so I do other things in my life that I know I can keep that control of, you know. Like I can keep control of my clean house, or I can, you know, organize things the way, I want them to be organized and then, you know they're nice and neat and the way, I want them. 

02:42:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. The other thing that happens with… with stress uh… I think both of those explanation make a lot of sense. Uh… the third thing to think about is uh… just the idea that when people are under stress, they are generally more aroused and things that normally might not bother them and if you imagine umm… uh… you know, when you're uh… it maybe for something to bother you, you probably have your stress level, anxiety level has to, to sort of go beyond some sort of threshold of some kind. When you're not under much stress and you're dealing with something in your life, some sort of anxiety provoking situation, your… your anxiety goes up a bit but maybe not enough to meet that threshold. When you're under stress, you are starting off up here. 

02:43:00
AMY At high level. 

02:43:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So uh… so it doesn't take must to, to bring it to a level that is… is overwhelming and anxiety provoking and… and difficult. So the books when you are not under stress, the books are not a problem because your baseline is, is low and when you're under stress, you know, a little bit of stress caused by the books kind of pushes you above that… that threshold umm… and somebody I worked, for example, was afraid of escalators and she was doing very well. So escalators was coming down over the course of the weeks, so we were just practicing, she was practicing riding escalators and one week uh… she was having a little stressful time at work and that week her fear of escalators was worse. It didn't have anything to do with the stress, she was having. It wasn't directly related uh… again just pushed everything up. 

02:43:45
AMY Okay. 

02:43:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY For her, so it may well be that once the stress subsides uh… umm… things will kind of go back to the way they were. 

02:43:55
AMY And it will be a lot easier for me. 

02:44:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, that's what I would expect too umm… to see happen. So… so this is a uh… uh… what is the end of term? 

02:44:05
AMY Umm… April 19th. 

02:44:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So another uh… couple of weeks. Umm… Okay, so that's… that's uh… 

02:44:10
AMY Sort of two weeks and two weeks from today, tomorrow. 

02:44:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:44:15
AMY Two weeks from tomorrow, so and I have two weeks off so. I watch a lot of TV. 

02:44:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:44:20
AMY Maybe a couch potato. 

02:44:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great, good umm… and uh… okay, so the other thing umm… that we have talked about was uh… uh… not cleaning your husband's car for a couple of weeks. 

02:44:30
AMY Yeah, that didn't work. 

02:44:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY That didn't work out. Okay. 

02:44:35
AMY No, I'm gonna have to work on that. Umm… there is I forgot when you ask like what was going on that's stressful, I just talked about the schoolwork stuff. Umm… there is also my youngest daughter has been sick and umm… she's been losing weight without any real reason. She eats very… very well and so they have been running all these blood works and all these blood works and all these tests and stuff and so far results have come back negative which is good. Umm… And now they are testing for more serious things and I'm like breaking down. 

02:45:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:45:10
AMY You know, I just, that's my little baby and so like that, that stress is like, I don't know how to handle it. So I'm just, I think I'm just taking it out on little things like the fact that, like when I get in my husband's car, you know, there is like, you know, cups or anything on the floor and I can't put my feet in that car, just like, I just lose it. 

02:45:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:45:30
AMY You know. So instead of just you know letting it go, like I was wanting to, I just, you know, I get the little bag out and clean it all up and put it away and stuff like that. So… 

02:45:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so uh… it's part of that just get your mind off the other worries. 

02:45:45
AMY It might be, I don't know. 

02:45:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Okay umm… so that sounds pretty upsetting. 

02:45:55
AMY Yeah, they're testing for cystic fibrosis. So and you know, when I read on mine about it, you know, the average age you know, life expectancy is 37. That's really… really low, I mean, in my eyes. I mean, I know, it's, my mom used to tell me, that is so much better than it was, you know 50 years ago. Well, that's fine but that does not affect my daughter 50 years ago. It affects her now. So… 

02:46:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY And what uh… do the sense from what they're saying of, is that, some of you think as likely or remote possibility or… 

02:46:25
AMY Umm… I'm not really sure. She's going in for, it's called a sweat test. 

02:46:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:46:30
AMY Umm… it's like an half hour to an hour long procedure they hook her up to electrodes and make her sweat. And umm… we're hoping to get that done like a week from tomorrow. 

02:46:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay and do you get the results right away. 

02:46:45
AMY Within a week. 

02:46:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Within a week, okay. 

02:46:50
AMY So you know, I've two weeks to, like, just sit here and think about it and I've been trying that too because there is me getting upset about it, it isn't gonna change, the results of her test or anything like that so. 

02:47:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So uh… and then, what… what are some of the other possibilities that they are looking at? 

02:47:10
AMY They look at Celiac disease umm… and I don't know what that is but that came back negative which is good. 

02:47:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:47:15
AMY But my worry with Celiac when I knew they're testing for that First of all, I think she's fine. 

02:47:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

02:47:20
AMY Umm… But second, celiac, she can live with that forever and just take, you know, control it with her diet, you know, she doesn't have to take any medications. She doesn't have to have any transplant nothing. And then with cystic fibrosis, by the age of 22, I think it is most people have had a lung transplant. That scares me. That's, you know, and umm… they also have to have a supplement with two feedings because they don't gain enough weight. 

02:47:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So is the, uh… is it also possible that it's nothing? 

02:47:55
AMY Yeah, yeah. You know and that's like one of the things I wrote down on my homework. It's one of the things that I just my anxiety level was just extremely high when I went to the doctor with her, and you know, umm… do you want this? 

02:48:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, let's take a look at that, so. Umm… okay, so you're at the doctor's office and negative for CBAC, now testing for CF, your fear and anxiety were 100. Umm… 100 out of 100. Your automatic thoughts were umm… she's sick, you could lose her. Umm… That she may never have a normal life. The evidence that she's losing weight even though she's eating a lot umm… and she fell off the chart in terms of, in terms of weight, okay. 

02:48:45
AMY Weight. Umm… and also she has these like pile ups on her nose which is another symptom or sign of cystic fibrosis and umm… she has a lot of colds, and she just got over bronchitis and all these little things that have not been, like I wasn't worried about her weight loss but then the doctor keep talking about it and keep bringing it up and umm… they keep writing all these tests. So it's making me worry like if you know, they're the doctors, they shouldn't, you know, if they are showing concern then… then that makes me think that I should be concerned as well. 

02:49:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:49:15
AMY You know, umm… 

02:49:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:49:20
AMY So it's not like, I'm sitting and saying, oh my daughter is sick, my daughter is sick. They are doing it to me and then I'm… 

02:49:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. And then umm… uh… Dylani(ph) your… 

02:49:25
AMY Older daughter. She's three. 

02:49:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, she's three and uh… she basically have the same symptoms. 

02:49:35
AMY Well, she doesn't have the pops on her nose and she doesn't have any problems with like colds or cystic or umm… colds and bronchitis. Umm… but she was always really small. She's always like kind of, anywhere like the 3 to 20% of her weight. Umm… and umm… she finally got better and she, they made her like they did some stool work to make sure that she was uh… digesting every, absorbing nutrients properly and they tested her thyroid and they also tested Kate and Katie is fine. 

02:50:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:50:05
AMY Umm… But, the thing is that the doctor keeps putting out to me is that Dylani(ph) was a picky eater and she didn't eat very much. 

02:50:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY All right. 

02:50:15
AMY So that was why she was smaller and Dylani(ph) never fall for charts. She was always, even though, she is really raw on it, she was still on it. Katie is now negative 7%. So you know that's, he's like that that's where our concern lies that she eats well and she's losing weight. 

02:50:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:50:30
AMY So. 

02:50:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… So when you… when you thought of it in that way, you thought of the… the evidence for it that she's losing weight, the evidence uh… against that you know, Dylani(ph) was also young, you didn't see a lot of change in your… your feelings. 

02:50:50
AMY They minimized a little bit but they didn't go away and umm… every time, I you know, it comes up in conversation, I think of other, it gets pretty high and then I have to keep reminding myself, Dylani(ph) was doing like this and you know, that's one of the things, so… 

02:51:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. And umm… is that, I guess, I mean, one question, these thought records are really designed for uh… for changing thoughts that are contributing to excessive kind of negative emotions. 

02:51:20
AMY Right. And that's… that's obviously. 

02:51:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY It sounds like something that your husband is very worried about? 

02:51:25
AMY Yeah. 

02:51:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY So your mother is worried about it? 

02:51:30
AMY Umm… I don't know. My mom and my best friend have been down playing a lot and that's like another thing that I have on it, same sheet. As when I'm… (inaudible) is my best friend and you know, she'll ask me how it hurt. Katie's doctor appointment when I might call, you know, just came back negative with another test for cystic fibrosis and she's like, she's not even that sick. Like she, you know, she's like, she's losing weight because she had a cold, you know. People don't eat when they have colds and it just really pissed me off that she's not… I don't know what the word is. It's not that she's not supporting me like she's downplaying and… and Katie might not have anything and that's what my hopes are and that's what I've been thinking all along until this past few weeks or in this past week. Umm… And like I'm there, you know, one of the things is like, I know that, the thoughts that don't support my anger with Julie are the fact that I know that Julie is trying to be strong and telling me like, it's gonna be okay, you know, it's gonna come through and Katie is not sick and she's trying to be supportive on that and… but at the time, I'll not take it that way. But as soon as I think about it, my anger with her just goes away. I'm like, you know, she's just trying to be my friend and. 

02:52:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so in that case the challenging seems to make a difference. 

02:52:35
AMY Yeah, yeah. 

02:52:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY What, I think you understand the fact that the… the doctors ordering these tests umm… in a way supports your uh… your thoughts right that she's sick, that you may lose her, she will never have a normal life and… and so on. Umm… How… how can you look at those tests in a different way? 

02:52:55
AMY I have no idea. Want to help me with that? 

02:53:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Sure. Yeah. 

02:53:00
AMY I'll not get over it but deal with it better. 

02:53:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY What do you know about doctors? 

02:53:05
AMY Umm… Well, that they are humans, that they make mistakes but one of the things that my doctor pointed out was Katie's pediatrician pointing out is that one of the first symptoms of there being a problem is weight loss and then after that it affects her height, and then, it's not for a while after that stuff happens that they actually get sick. So he keeps reminding, he's like, we're just ruling things out so we can catch anything, if she has something before she actually gets sick. And it becomes a serious problem. 

02:53:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So can they prevent her from getting sick or? 

02:53:35
AMY They can't prevent cystic fibrosis. 

02:53:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

02:53:35
AMY I mean, it's a genetic disorder. Umm… 

02:53:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. But some other problems they maybe able to. 

02:53:40
AMY They can start doing things with like nutrition. They can get the medication right now so she, they can prolong anything from happening like they can prevent maybe some colds or some bronchitis or pneumonia, those kinds of things that would affect her lungs or her intestines or whatever down the road. 

02:54:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Umm… so in terms of uh… you know doctors certainly would order tests, if they thought somebody had a problem but why else do they order tests? 

02:54:05
AMY Make money. 

02:54:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… I'm thinking they, they order tests basically to… to protect, to rule things outs, yeah…. yeah. Yeah so things that uh… that… that maybe you know, small chance if there is a problem because you don't want to miss it, right? 

02:54:25
AMY Right. 

02:54:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY If it is a problem. That's one of the things where if it is a problem, it's pretty bad. Umm… But… but the only way to know whether that's the case, even if the risk is probably possibly small is to… to do these kinds of tests for example and your doctor is not giving you a, it sounds like you're not getting, if the doctor is not saying, I think it's very unlikely but less rule it out or… 

02:54:45
AMY She's actually seeing her pediatric specialist now for… for her… for what's going on, and then, he doesn't give me much information like my last visit with him was like five minutes. Okay. Which, you know, kind of irritated me but you know, I know he's a doctor and he has a lot of appointments and stuff. Umm… but you know, he's just like okay Celiac, came back negative but she did lose another, you know, four ounces or six ounces or whatever it was like, so she's having cystic fibrosis problem, and run all these tests. And so he filled all the forms and says make an appointment in two weeks. That's it. 

02:55:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:55:20
AMY Umm… And then, when I went because Katie had a bronchitis, so I brought her back to her pediatrician, for a check up to see how she was doing and everything and I brought in. But she… that the specialist gave me that all the tests that he was gonna run and he maybe feel a lot better. 

02:55:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

02:55:35
AMY You know, he was the one who just like just, you know, he's like, I'm not trying to give you false hope but I really think that this is not what's going on. He's like, I really think that she's just like Dylani(ph), and she's gonna bounce back in a year or two. He's like… he's like, if she… he's like, if she is sick, if she does have a problem, he's like we need to catch it now. 

02:55:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:55:50
AMY So I mean, when he talked to me about it, I mean, I filled out that form before he tucked me, you know, he made me fill out that and you know and otherwise, I probably would have put, you know, something that doesn't support it as you know, doctor, doctor Paul's feelings on it, you know. 

02:56:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, because I think that's important and one… one thing umm… there is actually somebody I saw interviewed just in the past week on… on a show about a new book he's just put out on uh… umm… mistakes that physicians make essentially and there is a lot of umm…, it's, it's a lot of it is not science. A lot of it is art. So you do see physicians disagreeing with one another. But the other thing, I'm thinking about is that again if something is potentially very bad even if it's very unlikely, they need to let out umm… and… and I do really want them to explain all that to you in terms of like the doctor didn't. 

02:56:40
AMY No the specialist. But her pediatrician that which… 

02:56:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so you… you got the sense of that afterwards, but the… the uh… I mean, that's what I'm thinking is that to… to protect uh… Katie from remote possibility of something bad uh… to… to intervene early. It's important to do the tests. Not just to protect themselves, you know, doctors are also thinking about, you know, if you don't take all the precautions then they also set themselves for lawsuits and… 

02:57:10
AMY Liability, especially, in the state. 

02:57:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, absolutely, so… so umm… they tend, you know, my impression is always they tend to in the direction of being safe rather than uh… taking risk in these situations. Umm… So but again but I think it would be nice if they explained that to you. If they said, I think it's very, very likely but we need to do this or you know whatever. Umm… Okay. So that's uh… but… but I think given the information, you have, it's perfectly normal to be pretty worked up about this. Especially, you just listed all the stuff you've learned in the school right now that doesn't leave you a lot of resources to deal with this situation with your daughter, other stress is going on and the other things that we're working on. 

02:57:50
AMY Yeah. 

02:57:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So it's… it's been hard, sounds like a hard couple of weeks. 

02:57:50
AMY It's kind of very bad two weeks for me. So… But I mean, these… these have been helping out with you know, just like the homework issues and you know, trying to minimize my negative moods and feelings that come out, you know, so. 

02:58:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So it sounds like you've been using this for things that really are not just other things going on not the perfectionism so much. 

02:58:15
AMY Right. I mean, most of them except for the Katie thing and then another thing that happened today that I felt run out for so that you know. 

02:58:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… so do you want to show me. 

02:58:25
AMY Yeah, here you go. 

02:58:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Okay, so this one is the books, okay. Umm… so the room was really nice, there were books every where. Umm… and these are Dylani's(ph) put the books every where or… 

02:58:45
AMY She just did it like, when… when she reads them what she does is at night, she stacks them all up on her bed. 

02:58:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

02:58:50
AMY And she actually makes lines in her room in the order that she reads them and then umm… usually, I'll go in and like put them all back or the next morning, she'll wake up and she was doing it for a few days, and then, she just didn't, she just stopped. So and then that's when I filled that out. 

02:59:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Umm… and your automatic thoughts this house is such a mess, why can't she keep things neat and tidy? Umm… I'll do it, it's just easier for me to put it away, this mess will continue through the rest of the house. Umm… Evidence supports it uh… is that, the house is messy and it is easier for you to put it away. Umm… And you have evidence it doesn't support, the thought is that it's just one room. It does not spread into the rest of the house, there is evidence of that. Uh… She's just three, what she's doing is normal. 

02:59:35
AMY Yeah. 

02:59:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY I guess she's just learning. 

02:59:40
AMY She's a kid. 

02:59:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Umm… And uh… uh… the more balanced thought is why don't we just clean it up together and make it a game. 

02:59:50
AMY Yeah. 

02:59:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Umm… Let me ask you a question. Umm… From the perspective of… of wanting to umm… sort of change some of the perfectionism, I mean, another thought, you didn't write it down but umm… actually, let me ask you a question. Why would it be a problem that the books are a mess? Why is that a problem for you? 

03:00:15
AMY Because it's unorganized and I just… 

03:00:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY And if it's unorganized that will lead to… 

03:00:20
AMY It bothers me. 

03:00:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:00:20
AMY Umm… I mean, it doesn't really need to anything, it just, I mean it doesn't really lead to anything. It just… 

03:00:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Makes you uncomfortable. 

03:00:25
AMY I can't have… I can't stay in clutter. 

03:00:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:00:25
AMY And with, you know. 

03:00:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY And if uh… and if there is clutter, what will happen? 

03:00:35
AMY Umm… Sometimes I get very upset or I get snappy. Umm… I mean, it's not like the you know, how she's gonna fall apart or the world is gonna end or anything like that but umm… I, you know. 

03:00:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY But you feel uncomfortable. 

03:00:50
AMY Yeah, I feel very uncomfortable. 

03:00:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:00:50
AMY You know. 

03:00:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Why would that be a problem? 

03:00:55
AMY Umm… I don't like having anxiety attacks. 

03:00:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY No. Okay. 

03:00:55
AMY And then sometimes, something and this is awful but sometimes, little things like that give me anxiety attacks. I mean, it might be because of everything else that might be going on in my life and then that's just that one last trigger. 

03:01:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:01:10
AMY That sets it off. You know, that might not actually have anything to do with me having an anxiety attack but I just associate it with it because it's the last thing that I was dealing with when it happened. 

03:01:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:01:20
AMY You know. So… 

03:01:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… If you do start to feel anxiety building, does it frighten you? 

03:01:25
AMY Yeah. 

03:01:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:01:25
AMY And I don't know why it frightens me like, I mean, I can't breathe as well like I feel short of breath and my chest hurts really bad and I get really shaky and I'm shaking now. Umm… you know, I umm… I can't focus, I can't concentrate, you know. 

03:01:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY When was it last typically? 

03:01:40
AMY I don't know umm… it varies like today I've been having a lot. 

03:01:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:01:45
AMY So umm… sometimes it will last just as long as like, excuse me, a few minutes and sometimes it will last like over an hour. 

03:01:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:01:55
AMY Which would it last longer than, you know just like the five minutes and I start getting and I think that's what causes it to continue. Staying, you know, having those symptoms or whatever. 

03:02:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Do you get uh… afraid when you feel anxious, afraid that something will happen, that you may faint or, die or, lose control or… 

03:02:15
AMY No. 

03:02:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Not so much. 

03:02:15
AMY No, I don't… I don't really have those kind of things. I used to before I realize what the attacks were, you know, with umm… I think now that I realize, now that I'm aware of what those feelings are and I know that it's an anxiety attack or a panic attack whatever you want to call it umm… I don't… I don't look at it that way but it doesn't make the feelings go away. 

03:02:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Do you try to fight the feelings? 

03:02:40
AMY Sometimes. 

03:02:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:02:40
AMY It doesn't work. 

03:02:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY No. What does happen when you try to fight the feelings? 

03:02:45
AMY It gets… it gets worse. 

03:02:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you noticed that? 

03:02:50
AMY Yeah. 

03:02:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So what might you do instead of trying to fight them? 

03:02:55
AMY Umm… I don't know, I can do like the whole breathing thing or counting to 10 or whatever but at that moment, like I just, I don't do it. 

03:03:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:03:05
AMY Like I'm so flustered and… 

03:03:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Do those things work? 

03:03:05
AMY I don't know. 

03:03:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:03:10
AMY Sometimes I do, like sometimes I get to my husband's home, you know and like I have an anxiety attack. He can talk me out of it really easily. He's amazing with it. He should be a therapist probably. Umm… He, he's really good at like, you know, just calming me down and you know, that kind of thing. 

03:03:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:03:25
AMY Umm… 

03:03:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY one of the thing umm… about anxiety and… and panic and this negative thinking umm… like you said the more people try to fight it off and often the worse it gets and… and even distraction, you know, because counting to 10 or even breathing can be a distraction umm… yeah, in that moment may help you to feel more comfortable but I think it also uh… helps to reinforce that… that belief that this is something I have to get rid of. You know, as long as you're thinking that that these feelings are something I have to get rid of uh… it's gonna keep in there the long term. 

03:04:00
AMY Even with the counting to 10 or whatever? 

03:04:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, those things, again will bring it down, you know, briefly but uh… but it's not going to uh… it's not going, part of uh… what we want to do is… is uh… when… when people feel overwhelmed by anxiety and… and afraid of the anxiety and uh… have the urge to trying to kind of fight the feelings umm… what we want to do uh… in some ways is have people learn to accept those feelings and not fight them because as soon as… as soon as you become aware of the feelings without fighting them, so you just say well, my heart is racing, I am having difficulty breathing but it's just anxiety. I felt this many times before. It's uncomfortable but… 

03:04:40
AMY It goes away. 

03:04:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY It goes away. And you said, the… the long as it lasts is about an hour, is that right? 

03:04:45
AMY Yeah. 

03:04:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… So the feelings go away and if I feel uncomfortable for now, then I'll feel uncomfortable for an hour. Umm… That is going to help get it away uh… as soon as you're willing to feel that way, you're not gonna feel that way as much. So… so my… my recommendation is when you, when the anxiety does reach that kind of peak is to just go with it. Let it happen umm… the fact you know… you know, if… if this was a major focus for you, if you are having these, you are not having attacks very often right now, I don't think. 

03:05:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY For the past couple of weeks, I have been. 

03:05:20
AMY Okay. I have been having them like umm… when I first talked to you on the phone before we even met like they're happening, I don't know a couple of times a week maybe and umm… in the past. 

03:05:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY You weren't that afraid, I don't think either. 

03:05:30
AMY No. 

03:05:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:05:30
AMY And… Excuse me… Ever since like I was explained like what the symptoms were and why they were occurring, I haven't been afraid of them really. Umm… They just, they are just bothersome. 

03:05:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:05:40
AMY You know, umm… but the past, I don't know, two weeks, I've been having more than once a day, like I've been having them multiple times daily and… and that's what, and that's another thing is like that's bothering me so then, that's now added a little thing on my list of things that are upsetting me or getting to me or whatever and so just the fact that I'm having them more often makes me more anxious and then I keep having them more and… 

03:06:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right, you know what we do with people who are having them on a regular basis often is… is you know, often what happens is people start to avoid situations that uh… trigger them, they start to avoid thoughts that trigger them. They start to avoid feelings that trigger them. So they'll avoid uh… activities that bring them on. Sex or exercise or caffeine or anything that makes them feel aroused. Umm… uh… what we often do we people in those situations is encourage them to purposely experience those symptoms umm… until they are not afraid of them any more, so we'll actually have people purposely uh… spin around to get dizzy, if they are afraid of dizziness or umm… uh… but… but I think what we want to do is wait and see what happens once the stress dies down because if these are just reactions, stress will take care of themselves. If… if the stress gets better, the attacks continue then at that point, we may want to do some work specifically on those symptoms. 

03:07:05
AMY Those symptoms. 

03:07:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY But in the mean time, that can be very helpful to uh… to not fight the feelings. 

03:07:15
AMY I try not to because that's when I make, I know, that it makes it worse. When I can just you know try to do something and sometimes I will take my stuff out of the situation like if, when Dylani's(ph) do any books rather replace and I'll just, like I just trying to have like an anxiety attack. I'm just like, all right, I was going through it for a little bit and her and I were doing something downstairs and then you know, I mentioned her (inaudible), we go clean up your books so we can vacuum together. So that was a little bit better. Umm… But like the whole time, I was doing the other activity with her. I just kept thinking about this books upstairs in her room. 

03:07:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:07:50
AMY You know, so like you said, it didn't go away even with the distraction. 

03:07:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:07:50
AMY You know. 

03:07:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So how could you have looked at that differently? 

03:07:55
[sil.] 

03:08:00
AMY I don't know, I might have just let the attack go as like let the attack go its course and… 

03:08:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, you could… you could say to yourself I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now and in the past that feeling has gone away and it will go away this time too. That will be one option. How could you deal with the books? How could you think differently about the books? 

03:08:20
AMY Umm… I don't know, maybe I could ask her to do it and see if she will umm… like I said, maybe I can make a game out of it or maybe I can just try to let it go. 

03:08:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I'm wondering if, if uh… if you could, you know, one way of looking at this is… is saying one of the fact that you know, this is one of the situations it makes me feel very anxious and very uncomfortable. Maybe that's a sign that I need to sit with this and let it… let it happen, let it right out until I'm comfortable with it. 

03:08:50
AMY So should I just not do anything then? I just…. 

03:08:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY That would be… 

03:08:50
AMY No, I'm asking so like when I… 

03:08:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY You could hang out in the room with her. You could take a break from it as well, if you find that it's overwhelming to be in there. And you… you don't have to be completely torturing yourself in the situation. So whatever you feel like you need to do in that… that moment but… but just try leaving it that way until uh… it's not bothering you anymore uh… and then, you know, I'm not saying that your house should be a complete mess all the time. 

03:09:15
AMY Well, right. 

03:09:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY But it's… it's different cleaning up because you're terrified not to clean up rather than cleaning up just because you want to clean up. So one thing you could do is… is wait until the anxiety comes down uh… and then tidy up the room. You know, without putting it in order necessarily but… but… 

03:09:35
AMY I'm very good about not doing it at all. 

03:09:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Perfect. 

03:09:35
AMY I size or by off that… 

03:09:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Good. 

03:09:35
AMY So. 

03:09:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY You have been sizing? 

03:09:40
AMY I haven't. No order to it. I just put them away, however, they are laying on the floor, I stack them up. 

03:09:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Perfect and there is nothing, there is nothing wrong with putting stuff away, I mean, a lot of, I think most mothers have the books all over the place. They… they tie them up or they do it together or whatever. But if you're feeling that, that terror like uh… I have to put them away because I just can't stand this. That might be a sign to just wait until that terror comes down and then, then clean it up. 

03:10:05
AMY Okay. 

03:10:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY It's sort of like, if I work with somebody who's terrified of going to parties, so uh… because of social anxiety and shyness, so they… they have several drinks before they go to any social gathering. What I might encourage them to do is go to the gathering, let the anxiety come down on its own and then have a glass of wine. You know, rather than having it. 

03:10:25
AMY Previous. 

03:10:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so now having the wine to cope with the anxiety uh… let the anxiety take care of itself and then if you want to have a glass of wine, just because you want a glass of… of wine, that's different. And same with this. If you're cleaning up because you're terrified not to, uh… but it almost feels that way the way you're describing it. 

03:10:40
AMY Yeah, it does. We're not terrified like, you know, like a ghost terrifies a little kid but it's still that word. 

03:10:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY But… Yeah, umm… then, that might be a sign in that moment that uh… to… to wait maybe… maybe it might take a couple of hours, it might take a couple of days but uh… the worst that will happen is there will be a mess for a couple of days. 

03:11:05
AMY Right. 

03:11:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… so does that sound like a and yeah, the other thing, I also want to put this in the context of you've had a really difficult couple of weeks. 

03:11:15
AMY Yeah. 

03:11:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you also at the same time want to cut yourself some slack, you know, when you're going through. 

03:11:20
AMY Just hoping that, that would be okay. 

03:11:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Absolutely, so I mean, if you umm… you know, if you hadn't done any homework for the last couple of weeks with respect to this that will be completely understandable if what you're going through so… so don't uh… yeah, don't… don't feel like every week has to be uh… perfect in terms of this work because there are gonna be other, this is unusual couple of weeks, it sounds like. 

03:11:45
AMY Yeah. 

03:11:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY It sounds like the next couple of weeks will also be uh… Stressful so. 

03:11:45
AMY Yeah. Yeah, the next meeting is right before my final so. One of my classes so. 

03:11:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so you know… you know… you know, the way that I would think about this therapy, we got two more meetings but its don't mean that in the next two meetings, everything has to be changed uh… you know, the… the way, I would think about this therapy is we did learning some new ways to think about things and new ways to behave in… in these situations so that you can ultimately be your own therapist and… and continue to work on these things and that. 

03:12:15
AMY Those… those sheets are (inaudible) like using those. 

03:12:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great, good. Umm… so uh… the… the other, another thing that we talked about and I think… I don't know whether this may not have been a good two weeks to… to be doing this but you're gonna try to do something differently. 

03:12:35
AMY Oh, instead of baking? 

03:12:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Sorry. Oh yeah, that's so instead of baking. That's right. I didn't… I didn't write that down. 

03:12:40
AMY We didn't. We still baked. 

03:12:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, you baked, okay. 

03:12:45
AMY But that was on her. She asked because I asked what she wanted to do because I was… I had like a craft project ready, you know, and she's like, she wanted to bake brownies for daddy. So that's why we did that, the baking, it wasn't… 

03:12:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY It wasn't because you were pushing for. 

03:12:55
AMY No. Right, it wasn't… 

03:13:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY If she had said something else that you would have been fine with that? 

03:13:00
AMY Right. 

03:13:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, okay. Umm… that's good and… and for her did you, you've mentioned that she sometimes gets a little bit perfectionistic and yeah. 

03:13:10
AMY Oh yes. She's extremely particular about things. 

03:13:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So for her, is the baking about that? Uh… Or did she just want to bake? 

03:13:20
AMY I think part of it is that I made it into a routine and most children thrive on routine. So like she knows that you know, the… the day after we spend the night at Granny poppy's house that when she comes home and Kate takes me up, she gets to bake. 

03:13:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:13:30
AMY So I think that's just part of her routine. 

03:13:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY And she enjoys it and… 

03:13:30
AMY Yeah, she does. She picks up what we make. She goes to the book and picks out whatever picture she wants to make and then we make everything from scratch and so, I mean, I think, it's… she looks for it too, to it too, you know, so it's you know. Part of it just because I like to bake and that's why I started it the little tradition but you know, she's, she likes it. It's not like I'm forcing it on her or anything like that. 

03:13:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. It's not like as if she couldn't bake that it would be, you know, terrible for her or… 

03:14:00
AMY Right, no. I don't think so. She might… she might breakdown actually. She… she's pretty good at good at throwing things but umm… uh… she… she might breakdown umm… and like cry and you know mention that you know, but we always bake kitty maps or something like that. And then I'll go, if I can redirect by going over, we're gonna do this though today instead. You know. 

03:14:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY It might be uh… something to think about. If you see some of these traits growing in her like she remember, she didn't like the books were organized and would reorganize them. Uh… Trying to teach her some of these flexibility kind of skills. 

03:14:40
AMY It's early. 

03:14:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, yeah maybe. Something to take advantage of umm… in these situations. Umm… Okay, so this was a procrastination item. So you're working on your final uh… at the library at home just studying for your final exam. 

03:15:00
AMY Yeah, it was a take home uh… because it was through like a video course. So umm… 

03:15:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So in your uh… emotions were frustration, worry, fear, umm… so in your automatic thoughts are never gonna finish. I'm going to fail. Umm… I won't do my best work. Umm… You're going, your children and this is what they'll remember from their childhood that you're always uh… 

03:15:30
AMY That I'm always doing something other than spending time with them. 

03:15:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:15:30
AMY And that's a big fear for me. It really is this like, I want, I only work part-time for a reason. It's like, I spend that time with them and now I feel like I'm and this is something that I want to do and this is something my husband wants me to do is to go back to school and have a crew that I'm interested in and so I know that, that's just temporary, just for a few years, you know, but I'm always afraid that they're gonna sit and go, oh that is there never for me and you know, other thing and then I'm in therapy. 

03:16:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what uh… do you think generally that… that umm… the… the more… the more parents are around, the less the children are in therapy? 

03:16:10
AMY No. 

03:16:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY No, okay. 

03:16:10
AMY Not at all. No. Umm… 

03:16:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… so let's look at that thought although, we remember this as, you know, what… what percent of the time are you as around as you'd like to be? 

03:16:20
AMY As I'd like to be? 

03:16:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:16:25
AMY Oh, pretty close to a 100%. You know, I… I mean, like I work part-time and that is more for health insurance because it benefits my husband as. Any other part is just because it's something just for me, like I get out, I work with patients and I love it. Umm… 

03:16:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you're actually around quite a bit. 

03:16:40
AMY Yeah, you know, but I'm home almost every night except for my time at school. You know. 

03:16:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY And then so, how long, so this… this thought that you're ignoring your kids, is that just been during the exam period? 

03:16:55
AMY Yeah, and I think it's because like if I'm sitting at, you know and I'm on a computer on my laptop, they're just like come on mommy, play, come on, do this and I keep telling them, no I can't. I'm working, you know. Which is why my husband makes me go to the library because he's like so frustrating for you and for the kids, just get out of the house where you can focus without that distraction, you know. Umm… Well, it just makes me feel guilty that I have to, you know, not that kids should get every single thing that they want, I'm not all about that but you know. 

03:17:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Do they get you enough though? 

03:17:20
AMY I think so, I hope… I'd like to think that they do. 

03:17:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:17:25
AMY You know. 

03:17:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY So umm… So that and I guess that's the, the evidence not supporting that thought and there is still despite these terms that you're not, there are a lot of times you are there. 

03:17:35
AMY Yeah. 

03:17:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Okay. Any advantages from the perspective of your children of you doing all these stuff that you're doing? 

03:17:45
AMY Yeah, they… you know, they have… they… they play independently very well. They play together with each other. They don't have me in there, it's like, make them play a certain, not make them play a certain way but to like direct their play or to intervene all the time stuff like that. Umm… That's why I think it is good for kids to have like alone time and downtime and you know be independent. 

03:18:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY What are they learning from watching you could be in school and working? 

03:18:05
AMY I think it's a great thing that they know that, you know, mommy can achieve certain things and you know that… 

03:18:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you're actually modeling that time. 

03:18:15
AMY Yeah, yeah and I think it's a good thing too. It's just those moments were there just like, they get upset because I can't play with them at that particular moment that it gets to me. 

03:18:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:18:25
AMY You know. 

03:18:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Great. Okay, we only have a couple of uh… about five minutes left so, I want to talk about umm… taking into account what you know, stress that you know that you're going to be under over the next couple of weeks so I want to, want to be realistic about this. What umm… what kind of changes could you make or things you could do differently or what uh… what kind of homework would you like to try over the next couple of weeks? 

03:18:50
AMY Umm… 

03:18:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Thinking about what your goals are for the therapy? 

03:18:55
AMY I still like to work on like letting go of like the cleanliness of the house or dealing with the attacks I have when stuff like that happens. Umm… I get to work still on my husband's car and not having to control like his space, you know. 

03:19:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Is that something you think, you could do this couple of weeks? 

03:19:20
AMY Umm… I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. 

03:19:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Let me pick things that you think you can do. 

03:19:25
AMY Okay. I think, I can work on like the stuff at the (inaudible) bookstore like that whole thing. 

03:19:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:19:30
AMY Umm… switching up like my, umm… my routine with them a little bit so they know that it's okay to not have a specific like, you have to do this at this time every Tuesday or this time every Thursday, that type of thing. Umm… 

03:19:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So can we… can we come up with a couple of specific examples of things that you would do differently in that regard? 

03:19:50
AMY I can try the baking thing again. Umm… umm… I wanted to start taking my kids to the library, you know, because they love to read so, you know, have like a field trip with them. 

03:20:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So could you go to the library instead of baking? 

03:20:05
AMY Yeah. 

03:20:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Okay, now what if she gets upset? 

03:20:10
AMY Umm… I won't back down. Umm… But you know, I'll just try to explain that you know, we have something else fun plan you know and kind of talk to about like what she's gonna do, what she's gonna see and have been to the library before, so… 

03:20:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So good. Okay, so there is, there is value in uh… in doing things differently, even if it's upsetting, you know, if it's done in a supportive kind of way. 

03:20:35
AMY Right. 

03:20:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Then, that's great. Umm… Okay. Anything else uh… you're, you're doing a great job with the forms. If you can keep with that will be great. 

03:20:45
AMY Yeah. 

03:20:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Anything else that, that you'd like to work on over the next couple of weeks? 

03:20:50
AMY Umm… 

03:20:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Again, I understand that school has to be the focus, so don't. 

03:20:55
AMY Yeah. 

03:20:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Don't feel like you have to. 

03:20:55
AMY With school and then with Katie and then a couple of other family issues going on, so umm… 

03:21:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY That's fine. So don't, yeah, don't uh… these two weeks are unusual so… 

03:21:10
AMY Yeah. Umm… I don't, I can't think of anything umm… 

03:21:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:21:15
AMY I need to come in here thinking of things that I know kind of for the next time. I think I'll do. That's what I'll do. 

03:21:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Sure, we'll make that your homework, okay. 

03:21:20
AMY I will come up and view those. 

03:21:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY So why don't we… Because we have umm… when you come in next, we're gonna have one more session and you've three weeks between our next session and the last one. 

03:21:30
AMY Oh, okay. 

03:21:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… This one week, that I can't make it in it, so it's gonna be three weeks. 

03:21:35
AMY Okay. 

03:21:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So why don't we make a one year homework practices to come up with a, a game plan for the last three weeks. So we're done with school, you'll… you'll know what's going on with uh… with Katie uh… the amount of things will be common by then. So umm… so let's make a planning for the last three weeks. 

03:21:55
AMY Okay. That I can do. 

03:21:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. Okay. So we… 

03:22:00
AMY I like to plan. I'll plan. That's right. 

03:22:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So I'll back these down for you in a minute but we… we need to stop. 

03:22:00
AMY Okay. 

03:22:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So umm… we'll see you in a couple of weeks. 

03:22:05
AMY All right, thanks. 

03:22:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:22:10
JON CARLSON Marty, I don't know if our viewers notice but in this session, she seemed really different. 

03:22:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, she had a bad week umm… just before this session began, we were just chatting for a couple of minutes and she mentioned that her grandmother had just died and that, I think she… she either died that morning or the… the day before but it was very recent and very uh… very… very upsetting. 

03:22:35
JON CARLSON You were really close to her. 

03:22:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY She's very close to her grandmother, yeah, so you know, I just asked her is there something, you want to talk about in the session because it would really be something that would take us away but from the work that we have been doing and umm… that would… that would have been fine or we uh… so day after just continue with the focus on the perfectionism and she decided to do that. The other big stressor for her uh… in this session is that her youngest daughter uh… was significantly underweight and umm… the physicians were a bit concerned about it and one of the uh… things they were looking at was uh… possibly that she had cystic fibrosis. So she was umm… just about to undergo a bunch of tests for that and they were waiting for results and so on. So that was a big stress as well that umm… really… really both of those were a real distractions for her from the work that we were doing. 

03:23:25
JON CARLSON How does life stress effect problems, or problems like perfectionism? 

03:23:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY I think life stress exacerbates, it can have two effects. So it often exacerbates whatever problem people have. So if it's an anxiety problem, depression or drinking problem, people drink more when they are under stress. They get more depressed or they become uh… more perfectionistic, more anxious. We actually saw with her uh… this week uh… a panic attack, for example, or some increased concerns about panic. So I think uh… umm… that's something that uh… we need to uh… umm… be aware of and… and what we want to do is uh… think, we want to anticipate what's coming. Is this just a blip where the anxiety or whatever problems they're having is temporarily gotten worse because of the stress or is it something that's going to be ongoing problem? So it's something looking forward that we want to… 

03:24:20
JON CARLSON So you really have to teach her coping strategies or strategies for how to manage these stressful events differently? 

03:24:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I think when people are having real stresses, they're causing anxiety, realistic anxiety. The focus is not so much on trying to change their thinking or exposure or whatever. The focus is more on… on being supportive uh… just being generally good therapist and uh… and people with some coping, coping strategies uh… which… which may be some uh… if they are feeling very anxious, it maybe some quick breathing exercises to just manage some of the arousal, they're experiencing. It maybe taking a break from the stress and doing something fun for a couple of hours uh… just depends on the situation. 

03:25:00
JON CARLSON So it's necessary then to kind of divert from focusing on perfectionism and to focus on coping with stress? 

03:25:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY I think so, yeah and I think it again depends how much you have to divert, it depends on the client. So sometimes, you would just completely put aside everything you're working on and to focus on the stress that's happening. Umm… with other people, you might do a little bit of both but uh… yeah. 

03:25:20
JON CARLSON Yeah. Now can you set up session number five for us with your goals? 

03:25:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, the goals for session five are really to umm… you know, I let session four really concerned about uh… her grandmother, her daughter and for session five I really want to follow up on uh… some of those things and see how… how some of that is playing out. Whether those are still major stresses from her and… and decision what to do in session five over will be based on that, if some of those things have resolved then uh… we can get back into working on the perfectionism and otherwise, we may still need to do some of those stresses.

03:27:40
AMY Always have to like have other people seeing me as being perfect and good and… 

03:27:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:27:45
AMY All these kinds of things. So even if I need to get score done, if he's sitting down and watching TV, I can't concentrate on my score until the house is picked up. So if he's not going to do it, I'll go and do it. So now we're doing it up by size. So not really changing the behavior. He's like if she is sick, if she does have a problem, he's like we need to catch it now. 

03:28:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:28:05
AMY Like I knew the reason why I was having an attack, there's all these things worried on. 

03:28:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY You ask me, am I being too perfectionistic here, or Amy is actually trying to be less perfectionist with her kids and that… that's really good.

Session 5 

03:28:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Hi Amy, welcome back. 

03:28:45
AMY Thank you. 

03:28:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So umm… what I'd like to do today is to uh… see how things have been the last couple of weeks uh… to catch up on homework and uh… make some plans for the next while. I guess, I actually your homework items. 

03:29:00
AMY Yes. 

03:29:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY As well. So we can, we can talk about that. So anything that you'd like to add to that agenda? 

03:29:10
AMY Umm… no I got some plans for like you said to come up with you know, for the last three weeks or whatever. 

03:29:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:29:15
AMY So I have that and my own homework sheets and stuff, so. 

03:29:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. So we can, we can go through those and so you had a lot of, it's been a stressful period for you umm… and I just want to catch up on… on… I know these last couple of weeks, you were expecting it to be very stressful. 

03:29:30
AMY Yeah. 

03:29:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY I just wanted to catch up on, on things. So first of all, how is your daughter doing? 

03:29:35
AMY Umm… she's actually doing really well. Umm… her cystic fibrosis test came back negative. 

03:29:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. 

03:29:40
AMY And her blood record came back within normal limits and then there is one more test that the results will come back on Friday but the doctor has, is confident that those will come back fine as well. So… 

03:29:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. 

03:29:50
AMY It's a really off our shoulders and we're just kind of talking it up to genetics because small kids when they're family so. 

03:29:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:30:00
AMY So hopefully, she'll start gaining weight and then the problem will be or it won't have to be discussed anymore. 

03:30:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Excellent. Umm… and you also had a lot of school related stuff umm… is that behind you now, all of that? 

03:30:15
AMY Yeah, I did take home final and a huge research paper on addiction, that's done. And I had another research paper and another take home final and it's done and I turn it tomorrow. 

03:30:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. 

03:30:25
AMY And then, I have a final tonight after this. So… 

03:30:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:30:30
AMY But there is not a lot of pressure on the final. So I'm gonna, just I'm very relaxed right now. 

03:30:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Excellent. Good. Umm… so why don't you tell me a little bit about what's been happening with respect to the sort of perfectionistic kinds of behaviors you're, you're working on. Umm… we had three sort of homework plans. Umm… so one was to continue to keep uh… all those books out of order. Umm… so that was one item. Two go to library instead of baking on Friday and uh… to make a plan for the next three weeks until we meet again in terms of the kinds of things you'd like to work on. So… 

03:31:05
AMY Umm… the book thing has been going okay. It still have some like, I still get kind of anxious about it but you know, like you said, if I sit through it and let that anxious moment ride and then realize that nothing is gonna come of it. I've been doing okay with that. 

03:31:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:31:20
AMY I find it a little frustrating at times but umm… but then like making a conscious effort to you know just go with the feelings that are going on and letting the attack come and go and whatever. 

03:31:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Do you notice any change compared to when you first started? 

03:31:35
AMY Yeah, before I'll get more panicky and I didn't realize like when you'd ask before, you know, if I get fearful of it, of the feelings and stuff and I never thought, I did until like, made like a conscious effort just to let it, knowing that it was gonna end and it was much easier, I think. It was… it was, there was a difference like in the feelings and thoughts are going through my head when the attack happened. 

03:32:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so what were the thoughts going through your head? 

03:32:00
AMY I just, I don't know, well, one of the things I was thinking was like, you know, I got, still let it go and let, let the attack happen and so trying to like, fight it or do other things to calm it down and umm… or to not do something else instead. So umm… and then you know, I kind of, you know reiterated to myself that it's gonna be over and it's not gonna be the end of the world and the speedy heart will go away and my shortness of breath will go away and it will just, it seemed to go away a little bit quicker than. 

03:32:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great so you're challenging the, the fearful thoughts that you had. So do you think, so coping kinds of thoughts. What were the fearful thoughts? So before you started replacing them with these more uh… so coping kinds of thoughts, what were the… were you aware of what you were predicting might happen? What was? 

03:32:50
AMY I think before I really realized what like I was thinking in my head until, you kind of help me make myself aware of it and umm… like when I was seen there, when like the attack was first starting, you know, I was sitting there, getting more upset about the situation and so, just kind of letting it go, you know. 

03:33:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you're telling yourself that it was upsetting. 

03:33:15
AMY Umm… well, actually, it wasn't the book thing. It was something else. But and there were other triggers involved with it and why I was even upset easier or like… 

03:33:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY What was… what was going on? 

03:33:25
AMY Well, my grandmother had passed away. 

03:33:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:33:30
AMY Umm… and it was the day of her funeral and we were running late and umm… at one of the, you know, known as the grandchild who walked into the funeral or anything like that. So I was kind of frustrated and umm…, you know, my husband had to clean up the car and you know, we all dressed up and I was trying to get in the car and there is stuff in there and I was just getting like angry and upset and like I knew that, I was gonna be anxious and nervous and say, I have these other feelings because of what was going on with my family and my grandmother's passing and all that kind of stuff. But umm… you know, then I was, you know, I was afraid that you know, we weren't gonna get there in time. I was afraid that umm… I wasn't gonna be able to deliver the eulogy that I had written for her. Because of how it's at that moment and like then I was upset with my husband for not cleaning up the car when he knew that we were gonna be doing this and we are always running late. So when we run, when we go somewhere as a family, umm… but then, you know, like I kind of just told myself and like I'll just let this feeling go through and deal with it and you know, just kind of subsided when the steps, thinking about all the other things that were, something that I couldn't change. 

03:34:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Correct. 

03:34:35
AMY Like I can't change the fact that we're already. I couldn't change the fact that my husband didn't clean up the car an hour before we left. So you know, like can't change those things. I just kind of… 

03:34:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY You'll let go of that. 

03:34:40
AMY Yeah. 

03:34:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY And is that a new experience for you? 

03:34:40
AMY Yes. 

03:34:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, great. 

03:34:45
AMY So, I just realized that you know, getting marry him isn't gonna make the car clean, getting mad at or having an attack about us being late isn't gonna, you know teleport us to the… to the funeral, so. 

03:35:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:35:00
AMY So you know, okay. 

03:35:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay and… and you having the car being messy, you got there. 

03:35:05
AMY I got there the same time. 

03:35:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Same time. 

03:35:05
AMY Maybe quicker, probably quicker than if you had starting thinking, yeah. 

03:35:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Oh, yeah, much quicker, I had to clean the car. 

03:35:10
AMY So, okay, so that's… that's good and so the books then umm… have the books triggered panicky feelings or not, not so much anymore? 

03:35:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Sometimes but not, not as extreme as they were, you know, I think I'm just starting to, like you said, like the whole thing about going over the bridge, I had to go over the bridge so many times that it just kind of, dissipated, the fear and this is kind of like at times there are a little bit there but not strong. 

03:35:40
AMY Now, the other thing he says that your daughter got first, first a little uncomfortable with the book being out of order. 

03:35:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:35:45
AMY Umm… had she become more thoughtful of it? Umm… well umm… yeah, for the most part. There will be nights where she gets really upset if her books aren't in her particular order. But you know, like my husband and I made a point to tell her like, you know, all your books will still be here in the morning. And all the same books will still be here and you know, they are not gonna disappear if you don't put them in that order. 

03:36:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:36:05
AMY Type of thing, so we're hoping that she. 

03:36:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY And her order is… is her order isn't necessarily alphabetical order, right. 

03:36:10
AMY No, in order. 

03:36:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:36:10
AMY It was first because, I mean, well she knows alphabet but also like just because she knew, you know, animals whatever… whatever, whatever and umm… now she's kind of got away from that. 

03:36:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Does she has her own order that she likes? 

03:36:25
AMY Sometimes she does sizes, sometimes she does it on the order she wants to read them. So she does change up her order. 

03:36:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:36:30
AMY So she does change up her order. 

03:36:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:36:35
AMY But if they are not in order that she wants them, that's when she gets upset and then we kind of. 

03:36:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:36:35
AMY Work with her and bring that out. It's gonna be okay. 

03:36:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Good, okay. That sounds great. Umm… okay so that was the book and let me just uh… the uh… the baking of Friday, mixing it up on Friday, a little bit. 

03:36:50
AMY Umm… that was umm… it was hard for me, I think, I don't know. It was hard for me the first time and then umm… and I don't know a part of it was because my daughter was really upset about it but you know, I try to umm… maybe that is what help me get through that whole panicky feeling was trying to calm her down from her getting upset about it, you know and when we got to the library, she just have such a ball that she just wants to go everyday. 

03:37:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So… so and in the end, it was a positive experience as well. 

03:37:20
AMY Yeah. 

03:37:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY And I've been trying to not keep any specific routine with her with that like we don't go to the library every Friday. We don't bake every Friday. 

03:37:30
AMY Right. 

03:37:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY You know, I'm trying to like to something different all the time, so she doesn't so it's okay, if we don't do something or if we, you know, because routine is such a huge part of my life that it's upsetting for me not to have routine 

03:37:45
AMY Right. And so when I see that, she gets… she's getting upset, you know, it, I don't know sometimes it triggers it more and sometimes I have to get away from it because I have to calm her down or talk her through or whatever. 

03:37:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY so… so for you it was uh… more manageable than you thought it would be. 

03:38:00
AMY Yeah. 

03:38:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, it was. 

03:38:00
AMY And you've got, you did it twice. 

03:38:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. I did it umm… 

03:38:05
AMY Did you have the library both the time or… 

03:38:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY No umm… once I went to the library and then at the next week, we went up, we ran a bunch of errands and we went to a couple of different stores and umm… we did that. So we got out of the house and then we went to the park afterwards. 

03:38:20
AMY Okay. 

03:38:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY So, as we worked, he behaved well. Great. Okay, so there is so umm… great. You go back to baking next week. 

03:38:30
AMY Umm… actually we ended up baking last Friday night because she was just like mommy, we haven't baked in so long, so we ended up baking Friday night but it was, even though it was the same day, I don't, you know, it was a different time and that kind of thing so. 

03:38:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Routine. 

03:38:40
AMY Yeah. 

03:38:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so uh… sounds good and then umm… why don't we take a look at uh… some of the homeworks. So you… yeah, I'll take a look at that first so. 

03:38:55
AMY Some of it was already kind of brought up like my husband's car. 

03:38:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. So this first one uh… the situation was you were sitting at home in bed watching TV or relaxing for no reason, you had a panic attack. 

03:39:05
AMY Yeah. 

03:39:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… you're anxious, panicky umm… and then your automatic response was, what's going on uh… I'm not even doing anything, it's nerve wrecking right now. Umm… and you told me stuff not to panic. Umm… let me, some of these were questions. So you were, you know, asking why am I panicking right now? I'm wondering if in the back of your head, there was an answer to these questions, scary answer. Umm… any thoughts about. 

03:39:30
AMY I don't know, that was a more fearful one that I've had in a long time and I think it was because I thought I was relaxed. 

03:39:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:39:40
AMY You know, I was… I was at home. It wasn't like I was pressured for time for school work or had to do something with my kids or anything. I was just watching TV. And all of a sudden like, this overwhelming feeling of just anxiety came on and then I like couldn't breathe and I like I started like my hand started sweating and I just kind of like… 

03:39:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Any predictions at the moment like what might happen when you were worried that you might pass out or that you might lose control that uh… 

03:40:05
AMY I… I wasn't in control and that I think it's very scary, you know, because I mean, it wasn't like you know, when I'm in the situation like when we are getting out of the car to go to my Grandma's funeral, like I knew the reason why I was having an attack. There were all these things going on. With this is scary because I didn't know it was going on like I don't know why, this happened. You know. 

03:40:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY What do you want to start with? 

03:40:25
AMY Like what were they, like I couldn't, like I felt real tightness in my chest. I couldn't breathe and like I was slowly feel in my heart start racing. And then as that went on, that I would get more anxious and nervous and it would get, the symptoms would be more or stronger and I start sweating and just I couldn't control my thoughts. 

03:40:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Any fear that the panic attack would escalate and cause something to happen that you'd have a heart attack or you'd faint or that it wouldn't go away. 

03:40:55
AMY No, I did have the… the fear that it wouldn't go away. 

03:40:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:40:55
AMY But, I… I don't usually think of a heart attack or anything like that. But… 

03:41:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Any fear that it would just get so overwhelming, you wouldn't be able to cope with it? 

03:41:05
AMY Yeah. 

03:41:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:41:05
AMY On that occasion, yes. 

03:41:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Well, let's… let's try to figure out uh… what might have triggered it. Any… any guesses. 

03:41:15
AMY I don't know if like at the back of my head, I just knew everything that was going on, I mean, but I wasn't thinking about it at that time. I wasn't focused on anything. I just, you know. 

03:41:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY The umm… yeah, one thing that happens is… is generally that would be the last, when did this happen… this happened. 

03:41:30
AMY This happened umm… it happened after my grandmother's funeral. It happened after Easter. 

03:41:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:41:35
AMY So I mean, it was after… 

03:41:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY So basically three big stresses that week, you had your, your grandmother dying in a funeral, you had your daughter's health problem was and… and what actually not problems but what you thought was health problems. 

03:41:50
AMY Right. 

03:41:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY And then you had umm… schoolwork, everything started coming together at the end of the semester. Umm… so in that moment, I guess, a lot of that past. 

03:42:00
AMY Right. 

03:42:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… so what uh… is that stress be so have an impact? 

03:42:05
AMY It, yeah, I mean, the weekend of Easter was, you know, pretty intense with everything with my girls arrangements and sorry, umm… and that sort of thing and but I didn't feel pressed for time for school because I already had half my work done and I saw the other half to do but it, I didn't feel like it was pressing on my mind at the time. And that's the scariest part about the attacks that happened when like I'm, I'll be washing dishes and all of a sudden I'll have an attack. 

03:42:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:42:30
AMY And I'm not thinking about anything. I'm not in a situation that I find like anxiety provoking and that's the scary part is like, how I'm losing control and there is nothing wrong, there is nothing going on. 

03:42:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Well, one way of thinking about is that uh… when there is stuff going on, you're not focusing yourself. You're focusing on that stuff that's going on. Umm… so when you're under stress, you're focusing on schoolwork, you're focusing on your grandmother, you're focusing on your daughter, you're focusing on whatever the… the stress is. It's often after the stress goes away that people often feel the… the impact of the stress. 

03:43:05
AMY I think, I feel relief. 

03:43:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… you feel relief but also possibly some what vulnerable from the… the experience. 

03:43:10
AMY Okay. 

03:43:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY You got a bit of a cold right now. 

03:43:15
AMY Yeah. 

03:43:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY I don't know whether I told you the story or not. But I remember, when I was a graduate student, I always had a cold during Christmas vacation. Pretty much every year. Umm… 

03:43:25
AMY When you had nothing going on. 

03:43:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, it wasn't… it wasn't during exams, it was after and Christmas vacation was always right after exams. So the… the stress of, I don't know whether this is reason but not, I always wondered whether the stress of the exams made me more vulnerable so that right after exams, uh… I kind of crashed and got sick or whatever. So, so uh… it started all unusual for people with who are some what prone to panic attacks to have them. They can surely have during stress periods but it's also not unusual to have them after the stress has, has passed. So it may just be that you're just more vulnerable to, to the experience and uh… any reasons, there is actually a whole phenomenon called relaxation induced panic. So there are people who uh… when they're actually doing relaxation exercises, they are more vulnerable to panic, panicking during those times than at other times. It's also people who when they are lying in bed, they're more vulnerable to panicking than they are at other times during the day, when they are walking around busy. Why do you think that might be? Any guesses? 

03:44:30
AMY I guess, because, I don't know. A lot of times… Would be because you know, you're focused on other things and then your body like how you're seeing, how you always got colds after the fact almost like your body knows that it has to stay well to get through something and then it started kind of like, let's go. 

03:44:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY A passive receptor. Yeah, it could be… it could be that sort of thing. Umm… uh… you know, part of it also is that, it's just what you're focused on. Now if you're focused on your breathing umm… you know, last, I mean, we could do an experiment right now, I can ask you to take a, actually, I won't, let's not do breathing, let's try something different. What I'd like you to do is to scan your body for an itch. 

03:45:10
AMY Right, I found one. 

03:45:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so it took you about two seconds. Umm… do you think, if I hadn't mention that, you would have been aware of it? 

03:45:15
AMY No. 

03:45:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:45:15
AMY It's scratchy. 

03:45:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY so… so basically, if you're… if you're looking for physical symptoms, you'll often find them and I think when people are doing relaxation exercises when they are lying in bed, they tend to focus more on themselves because there aren't distractions out there necessarily. 

03:45:30
AMY Okay. 

03:45:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY And as soon as you start focus on yourself, you may notice your breathing. I remember the first time uh… I don't know if it's part of your training you've learnt how to teach people to do slow breathe sort of, sort of relaxation. 

03:45:40
AMY Yeah, I do relaxation therapy. 

03:45:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY I… I remember the first time, I ever was learning how to teach somebody to slow down their breathing, I was watching uh… another therapist do this with client and just watching them talk with their breathing, I started my own breathing start to feel a little strange and I couldn't quite get a breath or whatever. A few minutes later, it run away but just focusing on your breathing in on itself can trigger some of the sensations. So it maybe something as simple as umm… you were just a little bit focused on your… your breathing at that moment, when you were watching TV. It could be umm… that for whatever reason, you were a little bit breathless or something like that. Umm… you reacted to it. You noticed it maybe in a way that, that you wouldn't at some other time for whatever reason. Again maybe because you didn't have a lot of distractions. Since you noticed it, you might have maybe have the thought that oh no, my breathing is a little funny. And your heart starts racing a little bit. Oh, no, I have a panic attack right now. And then what happens. 

03:46:40
AMY It starts escalating. 

03:46:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY They start breathing more and… and not getting enough air but breathe more heavily and then they start hyperventilating and even before long, you're in the middle of a panic attack. Umm… so the one side of the blue, the way we understand panic attacks out of the blue, you know, I would think of it almost as a reaction to physical symptoms. The same way if you're afraid of dogs, if there was a dog in the room, you might react with panic. If you're a little bit uneasy about some of these physical feelings that you don't like uh… and they happen you react to them as if it's a dog that you're afraid of and it seems to happen out of the blue because those symptoms happen out of the blue. And it's only, even in normal, you might not even notice them but if you're attending to them and looking for them in some way, like that itch that I asked you to look for. 

03:47:20
AMY Yeah. 

03:47:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY You notice it and you react to it. Umm… so if that's the case, if it is just a reaction, the panic is a reaction to some of those early physical symptoms that you're having. It started with breathlessness or some uneasy. 

03:47:35
AMY Yes, I had tightness in my chest and it was hard to catch my breath. 

03:47:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… what were you watching on TV? 

03:47:45
AMY Umm… the ultimate fighter. 

03:47:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:47:45
AMY I'm embarrassed. 

03:47:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY You could have made something up. 

03:47:50
AMY I couldn't… I couldn't come with anything quick enough. 

03:47:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… some people have panic attacks though will avoid very emotional movies like scary movies because it gets trigger some physical symptoms. 

03:48:00
AMY I mean, it's, it's make martial arts fighting. 

03:48:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So it was sort of. 

03:48:05
AMY It's intense. 

03:48:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY It's intense and so that, even that might have let some tension in your chest. Then you turn your attention inward maybe and then that sort of got the whole thing going. Just guessing but, but that's often the kind of pattern, we see when people have panic attacks out of the blue is that they're reacting to some physical symptoms that they are afraid of the same way somebody is afraid of dogs might react to, to a dog, you know. Yeah, in your case, you're not afraid you're gonna drop dead or whatever but you, it sounds like you… you're afraid of the idea of losing control over physical symptoms and… and the idea you won't be able to cope and that will escalate into something that you can't. 

03:48:40
AMY Yeah. 

03:48:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Control. Umm… so… so in terms of uh… umm… the… the belief that is that you won't be able to control these… these symptoms umm… any evidence for that particular belief? 

03:48:55
AMY Just so that they keep getting, they were getting stronger. 

03:49:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:49:00
AMY You know, at the time, it's like. 

03:49:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So uh… yeah they were seem to be escalating. 

03:49:05
AMY Right. But then… 

03:49:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY What about evidence that you ultimately would be able to control them? 

03:49:10
AMY They always go away. 

03:49:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY They always go away. 

03:49:10
AMY Every time. I mean, there has been obviously, I'm sitting here without having one or continuing with one or whatever. So obviously that they don't last forever and nothing does come of it, like I don't pass out, I don't faint, I don't have a heart attack or anything like that. So… 

03:49:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY How long do they last usually? 

03:49:30
AMY Usually, they only last like a few minutes. This one last like half an hour and I don't know if it was because you brought up a point that, there is nothing else going around me, so I was just focused on what, I was feeling like the physical symptoms and maybe that's why it was longer than the ones that happened when I am in more stressful or anxiety provoking situations. 

03:49:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY A lot of people, I work with as soon as they start feeling panicky, they start vacuuming, ding all these things to get their mind off it. 

03:49:50
AMY Yeah. 

03:49:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY But I'm not suggesting you do that because, because in a way that feeds this belief that, oh, no, I got to get rid of this feeling. 

03:49:55
AMY Right. That's what you told me like you know let, let those feelings of physical symptoms or whatever go their course or whatever and that's what I was trying to do so. 

03:50:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:50:05
AMY I just sat there. I didn't do anything well, I mean, I kept watching TV and stuff, so I like get up and make myself busy. 

03:50:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Good. Umm… yeah in terms of the stress, I wouldn't, even though you wouldn't stress of that moment, I wouldn't minimize the impact of that couple of weeks on you umm… so umm… okay, let's look at another one. So you had an email. 

03:50:30
AMY That's my mother-in-law. 

03:50:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY From your mother-in-law umm… but during this dance recital and what was the email? 

03:50:40
AMY Umm… I'd emailed, you know, like my parents, my husband's parent and a couple of other relatives that Dylani's(ph) dance, the first dance recitals are gonna be in June and I… I need to know who wants to come because I have to pay for the tickets by this Monday. So she was, I feel like, a week and a half of me met her a few times. She got back to me on it. And I wasn't happy with her response but I'm over it now, so… 

03:51:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, and what was your response? 

03:51:05
AMY Umm… well, she said that she wasn't gonna be able to make it because umm… she's in grad school herself right now. And she graduates in May and the dance recital is in June and she's like, well I don't know where we're gonna be in a couple of months from now and umm… you know, I only work on the weekends so I can't really take time off. Well, that kind of upsets me just for the fact that it's showing as a couple of grandkids and it's her first granddaughter's very first dance recital and she's not making an effort to come but by then she'll have graduated from school. So she can work during the week if she needs to, make up hours or whatever. Umm… and she tends to only come into town when her other kids aren't coming. Like when my brother-in-law is coming to town, it's the only time she'll ever make the trip to visit her grandkids. And that just kind of irritates me. So you know, I was like having all these anxious feelings because I felt bad for being angry with her. 

03:52:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:52:00
AMY Because of this. 

03:52:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:52:00
AMY You know. So… 

03:52:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So your, your thought was that she expects to uh… you to be there for her things but she doesn't reciprocate umm… any other thoughts umm… why, you know, why uh… usually when people are annoyed or like again they're feeling threatened in some way of the situation. So any thoughts about why she might not have been coming? 

03:52:25
AMY I don't know. I sometimes feel like, she puts my husband and his family like on the back burner. 

03:52:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:52:30
AMY And that just irritates me and it hurts my feelings because I take it as like a personal effect to me. 

03:52:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, okay. 

03:52:35
AMY You know, and umm… but… 

03:52:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY So the feeling that it means that she's not uh… respecting you. 

03:52:45
AMY Right or she doesn't value like me and my, and our kids, you know. And umm… 

03:52:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Any, any thoughts about what that means about you? 

03:52:55
AMY Umm… well, I… I do know for a fact that when my husband and I were, my husband and I were dating that she wasn't very fond of me and my brother, I mean, she had actually told my brother-in-law that and I don't know if, it's because I was dating her very first son or she thought I was after his money or if that was because umm… my husband was almost killed when he was one and a half because of a car accident. And so, you know, the fact that she almost lost him that she has like this special tie with him and she doesn't let go. I have no idea. But she was not fond of me and it could just be my personality but who won't like me. But umm… he umm… she whenever her and my husband argue about something, she always is like we'll get his opinion. He's like no, I'm not gonna do that because if I get Amy's opinion is the same as mine then you're gonna like Amy for the decision we've made. You know, you're gonna put the blame on Amy. He's like I'm taking the brunt of this. This is my decision. When he tells her no about something that she wants. 

03:53:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

03:53:55
AMY You know, but umm… like she's, like I said, she's graduating in May and we're taking the drive with, with the kids to go for her graduation and we're really excited about it or at least I am and other kids will be excited to see her. Umm… it's like, you know we… we try to make that effort to go there and be there for her things that we know are important to her but then when things are important to me or to my husband or to our kids, it just, I don't get the feeling that she's given us that same kind of attention, I don't. 

03:54:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Does she expect that attention from you? 

03:54:25
AMY Oh, yeah. 

03:54:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:54:25
AMY And she said it too. Like she made a point. In the beginning, it was like, oh no, don't come to my graduation, it's not a big of a deal. And now she's getting angry because we might not be able to be there exactly for the time she wants us there. We will be there for the weekend but we might miss out on a brunch or something and she's very upset about it. 

03:54:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Is your husband also uh… hurt about her not coming to the dance recital? 

03:54:50
AMY No, he careless. 

03:54:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what's the difference between how he's looking at it and how you're looking at it? 

03:54:50
AMY He looks at it as well then we don't have to house my mom for three days and I don't have to hear her, you know, nitpick at things. All right, he just have to deal with it and then I take it as personally like she just doesn't want to support the girls or support me or you know. I don't know because I'm a girl. I take things more personally. 

03:55:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Does she see it that way as well that she's not being supportive? 

03:55:15
AMY Yeah. 

03:55:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY But he's okay with that? 

03:55:15
AMY Well, he gets kind of irritated and stuff but he's really good about just letting go. At least, he seems to be, you know, he just, you know. 

03:55:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:55:25
AMY He kind of has it, there is nothing, I can do to make her want to be here and I don't want to be here if she doesn't want to be here. So he just lets her go. 

03:55:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:55:30
AMY So. 

03:55:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… okay, so that's just, the belief that she should be there with you umm… and that it's a personal kind of a fronter or… or says something about how she feels about you and the family. 

03:55:45
AMY Right. 

03:55:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… the evidence she only comes to town when, when uh… all of her sons are here. It says… she says, she can't afford it umm… but yet she travels a lot goes to places. 

03:56:00
AMY Yeah. 

03:56:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… uh… the evidence that doesn't support your thought is that umm… 

03:56:05
AMY Just making me look bad, I don't know. 

03:56:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY It say… 

03:56:10
AMY It's an eight hour drive. She lives in Minneapolis. 

03:56:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Oh, it's an eight hour drive for her to come here. 

03:56:15
AMY Yeah, so and like I said on the paper, an eight hour drive for a three year old's five minute dance, that's a little ridiculous that I'm expecting her to drive all that way for. 

03:56:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY You didn't tell me that. 

03:56:25
AMY Oh, that's exactly why I was, you know, the support, I'm like. 

03:56:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, yeah. Okay so when you look at that way, you're, you're mood at the end is much more relaxed, much more understanding. 

03:56:35
AMY Yeah, like I mean, I can't expect her to be here for every little accomplishment or every little thing that my kids participated in and that's not realistic. No matter how I deal with it and I… I… I can't put that expectation on her especially because she lives so far away. Like if she lived in Chicago, then I could justify my hurt feelings because it's only 45 minutes drive or whatever. 

03:56:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

03:56:55
AMY You know. But… 

03:57:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY How often does she do the eight hour drive to visit? 

03:57:00
AMY Umm… she came in after Katie was born and then she came in for Christmas and then Kate's baptism and Christmas, so four times in two years. 

03:57:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:57:15
AMY So I mean, every six months, you know. 

03:57:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY And do you think that's about what you'd expect. 

03:57:20
AMY Yeah, and you know, we… we make trips to Wisconsin because it's halfway point, it's four hours for each person. So we do see her about every three months or so. 

03:57:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

03:57:25
AMY You know, and we went up to Minnesota a couple of times to visit her. Umm… so, I mean, it's, it's not like she's not a bad Grandma at all. I don't want to cut, to have that point come across, you know, she sends the kids gifts. She calls them on the phone. She's a very must part of their life. I just, at that moment, I was just like, had the anxious feeling and I thought about like, oh my gosh, how can I have an expectation for her when… 

03:57:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY And it sounds like, you were able to really work that through uh… 

03:57:50
AMY oh yeah. And I can videotape it and send it to her. You know. She's probably going to be that great anyway. She's three. 

03:58:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Umm… okay, that's, that's so for. 

03:58:05
AMY So but without this worksheet, I don't know, if I would have like sat there and actually thought about the reasons that don't support it, you know. I'm getting a little bit better at doing that without having felt a doubt but. 

03:58:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY What if because I didn't… I didn't realize, I hadn't read this far ahead. So I was thinking umm… maybe she lived half hour away and… and couldn't make it. What if it was just uh… a half hour away and she just, for whatever reason, she just doesn't feel like she could make it to this? 

03:58:30
AMY I mean, if it was a legitimate, to me, it was like a legitimate excuse like she couldn't get out of work, you know, she works every single Saturday and there is no way she can normal sit there or umm… or if she has like a prior obligation, you know, I guess, I mean that wouldn't be something that I would be okay. If she didn't want to, I would just, I'd be very hurt. I don't know, if I can get over it. Well, I mean, I can get over in time, I wouldn't, I'm not type of person to hold a grudge against her. 

03:58:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY She said, she's a really good grandmother. 

03:58:55
AMY But, I know. 

03:58:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY So could a really good grandmother just not come to a dance recital and still be a good grandmother? 

03:59:00
AMY Yeah. I don't like you anymore. 

03:59:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY What do you think? I mean because really, I mean, in this case your and this case she looks far away because she didn't, you're still uh… in a way you're imposing your value about what's important for a grandmother to do and then maybe lots of other ways she can be a good, maybe she's like, I… I can't stand football. Like it would be really hard for me to go to a grandchild's uh… sports like I was never into sports. Just not football. 

03:59:25
AMY Okay. 

03:59:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY I really don't like. Umm… 

03:59:30
AMY So you don't know what the ultimate fighter is then shh 

03:59:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY No, no, I don't. No I've actually never seen a football game. Umm… 

03:59:40
AMY The Bears going to the superbowl. 

03:59:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY No, no bears aren't big in Toronto. 

03:59:45
AMY Why not? 

03:59:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY We only have that NFL in Canada, so umm… but anyway, the… the uh… you know, so for me that would be really difficult to do as a parent or a grand parent but there would be lots of other things that I would want to do as a parent or a grand parent so. 

04:00:00
AMY I don't know. I think my parents especially my mom was like, they were at everything we are in and we are in a lot of activities. I was in girl's scout. I was in cheerleading and palms and soccer and I was a very active and there was not one thing that my mom missed and to me that's just what you do as a family. You're just there to support each other, emotionally, physically everything. You're just, you're there and. 

04:00:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Are there other ways that other family, families may do that differently though? 

04:00:25
AMY Yeah, and I have to keep reminding myself and my husband's family is very different from mine. I mean, I have an aunt that lives four hours away in Michigan. She's coming to my daughter's dance recital. My brother who is six hours away who is my daughter's godfather, he's driving in for her dance recital. 

04:00:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:00:40
AMY So when I know that my family members are making that extra check then you know, I just feel like I don't get that same extra, I don't know. But that's my family and I turn them over it and I don't know. I mean, you're right, she won't be a Grandma if she didn't go to the dance recital, even if she didn't tell him. 

04:01:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So. 

04:01:00
AMY I probably just have a harder time justifying my feelings. 

04:01:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY And just umm… you know, there is a lot of things that you do for, for your children that other parents might not do and still be good parents. 

04:01:10
AMY You're right. 

04:01:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Just, just be different parents. 

04:01:15
AMY Have different expectations than me. 

04:01:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, umm… okay so that's but it sounds like this was a really helpful exercise for you. 

04:01:25
AMY Maybe, I can write that down on my plan. 

04:01:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… okay so that's, so the other one is the… the other one we were speaking about, yeah. Okay. Great, so let me give this back to you. Let's talk. We got about ten in this last. I want, I want to make sure that we… we take some time to umm… to talk about uh… the plan for the next three weeks what you see as priorities. 

04:01:50
AMY Okay. I have something done. Yeah, you can, you know, the list is there. 

04:01:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so… so what is, what are the first, these are the other two items. 

04:01:55
AMY Yeah. I've jot down how I did it so. 

04:02:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So for the next three weeks, you want to continue working on the books. 

04:02:05
AMY Yeah and I think I'm pretty good with that. 

04:02:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yup. 

04:02:05
AMY Umm… 

04:02:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY And the dishwasher is easy now. 

04:02:10
AMY Dishwasher is great. 

04:02:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So uh… continue to work on books. 

04:02:10
AMY Is it okay, if it bothers me when I load the dishwasher that they are not doing? I have the anxiety attacks over it. 

04:02:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. and… and does it bother you as much as it did at the beginning? 

04:02:25
AMY No. 

04:02:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, okay. Umm… helping family clean, what does that item? 

04:02:35
AMY Well, because my husband is the type of person like when he gets done putting the kids down and I think I talked about this before. He likes to go and relax for a while before he starts cleaning. And I, once I sit down I'm done. Like I just want to get it all do with and then relax. So I don't like get up and start all over. So what we've been trying to do is before we put our kids down for bed, we try to clean up certain things and like umm… if my daughter wants to go outside and she's been playing with her Legos, she has to put all her Legos away before we can go outside before, I would just let it go and I would clean up everything. And then that just puts that responsibility on me and then it makes me more anxious and it gets me frustrated with other people for not helping out. So I'm trying to work on that and like you know…. 

04:03:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what specifically would you do umm… differently say tomorrow night umm… would you… would you then wait and then clean when your husband wants to clean or would you? 

04:03:30
AMY I want, I want my kids to learn how to clean up after themselves away. Like you know. 

04:03:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY You wouldn't basically, you uh… wouldn't clean as much. 

04:03:35
AMY Right. 

04:03:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So they would, they would end up doing more then, okay. 

04:03:40
AMY Yeah. So I cannot well, yeah, kind of pass her responsibility. So I mean. 

04:03:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So umm… so uh… begin to that your children and husband do more of the cleaning, okay. Okay. Great. Umm… okay so then allowing anxiety impact actually occurs, so not fighting them is something you've already been working on. 

04:04:10
AMY Yeah. 

04:04:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So. 

04:04:15
AMY That's a, use diversional tactics. 

04:04:20
[sil.] 

04:04:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Great umm… take a step back to think before reacting. 

04:04:30
AMY Yeah. Like if I were on the fourth with my mother-in-law when she gave me the news that she wasn't gonna come, I was probably really silent with her for the rest of the conversation and then when I got off the phone and probably like thought about it and realize that it wasn't that, it's not that big of a deal. My three year old, I can't believe nana is not here for me. You know, it's, my kids and I are a little bit different. Since she's not gonna care, I mean, she would be excited if she was there but her not being there, she's not gonna. 

04:04:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:04:55
AMY It's not gonna affect her, you know. 

04:05:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what can you do in that moment because this could have easily happened when you were on the phone with her? What did you do in that moment? 

04:05:05
AMY I don't know because that's, umm… I mean some of the not that situation but something happened the other day when I went to go to my daughter for gymnastics and they had no openings left. And I just got kind of upset but it's not their fault they don't have any openings left. You know, and then when I left, I was like, why do I get so like uptight and whatever about it because it's not their fault. There was nothing that they control. I don't know if it's the expectation that I have for everything to be perfect and everything to work out that I just get so tense and excited and like frustrated at that moment. But I just need to, I don't know… I don't know what I could have done in that situation either way where I wouldn't have you know, but when my expectations aren't met, I just had a hard time just accepting it in a positive way without… 

04:05:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Are you able to be aware that you're doing that? 

04:05:50
AMY No. 

04:05:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY In the moment? 

04:05:55
AMY No and that's what I want to try to work out because when I'm in that moment, I get upset and then when I get out of it, it's like, that was awful. Like the way I felt it was awful, the way I dealt with it was awful. It's sometimes the way I react to the person is awful. Like if I were on the phone with my mother-in-law, I know, I would have been very, I would have gotten nasty, that's not my personality, you know, so anything that I would regret it, I would just then kind of short with it probably yeah for the rest of the phone call and then if I were to talk with my husband about it and whatever, I would have realized that you know, that was a huge thing that I was expecting her to… to do and it's not that big of a deal. It's not like something horrible is gonna happen to Amy, if she doesn't, she's not there but at that moment like, I don't know and but I'm not aware of it until Afterwards. But now that I've, like I came up with that goal and umm… actually it was yesterday, after the gymnastics happened and I'm like, you know what that's where I have to think about like and that's another thing with like how we talked about my best friend at the beginning like when she does something that doesn't meet my expectations, I would get so upset and I would react negatively towards, towards her and then after the fact, I would regret my behavior or my feelings or my thoughts or whatever and but I'm not aware of it at the time. 

04:07:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:07:10
AMY On how to become… 

04:07:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Have you had more contact with her over the last few weeks? 

04:07:15
AMY Yeah, things have been going really well. 

04:07:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So ever since you talked, it's, things are different. 

04:07:20
AMY Yeah, yeah, I think we're more open and stuff with each other so. 

04:07:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. So yeah, I mean be one, one option is, is if you, now that you're beginning to pay more attention to this you're beginning to… to work it through on paper afterwards, you may find that in the moment, you may be able to begin to notice that you know, hey I'm feeling, really, really upset right now umm… and that can be a trigger to, to wait. Just wait until you have a minute to either on paper or in your head to, to be into uh… you know, ask yourself the question basically that and does this matter as much as if you feel like it matters. 

04:07:55
AMY Yeah. 

04:08:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… you know and… and uh… and another question, I think is useful is would everybody feel the way I do right now? Sometimes, the answer should be yes and you had certainly had some stresses over the last couple of weeks. Right. Anybody would be reacting the way, you did or, or worse than the way you are reacting, you know, this is very… very stressful situations. But in other situations, you might find that there is really a lot of different ways to responding to a situation and that, that you always went one way but it's not the only way necessarily, yeah. But it does, it does take uh… there is gotta be a piece of you that can, can step back from it and see it happening in a way and sometimes it's easier to do that afterwards and maybe that umm… maybe for now that, that's the best way to do it and if you can't catch it in the moment and then but that hopefully, we'll get, it will get easy over the time. 

04:08:45
AMY Yeah, because that's something that I hope, that I'm gonna start working on now, so. 

04:08:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… have you, have you noticed any changes in, in your moment by moment reactions? 

04:08:55
AMY Like in situations like that? 

04:08:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:08:55
AMY No. 

04:08:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Not yet, okay. 

04:09:00
AMY No and that's why like you know, I didn't really become aware of it until yesterday when I walked out of it, the gymnastics facility and I kind of thought about like you know, it's hard to react to everything when it doesn't go the way, I want it to or expect it to. 

04:09:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:09:15
AMY You know and I just, I, so I become more aware of what is happening so I can hopefully take the mental note to realize that it's not as bad as I think it might be. 

04:09:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. That sounds good and one way of doing that is building in some exposures to surprises. So you could, you could ask your husband for example over the next couple of weeks to come up with a few changes of plan and spring them on over the last minute. That would be one way to, what do you think of that? 

04:09:40
AMY That probably would be a very good exercise for me. 

04:09:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. Did you want to try that? 

04:09:45
AMY Yeah. 

04:09:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. So, I'll make a note. I'll give you this bag. You can make it. 

04:09:50
AMY That's something that won't be easy for me, so. 

04:09:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY No, and hopefully things that are, you can tell that you want to depict things that aren't really… really difficult necessarily maybe things that are, that he thinks will be moderately difficult umm… you know, is manageable. So we actually just have about a minute left umm… is there anything else that you'd like to talk about uh… before we give you much time. 

04:10:15
AMY Oh, no, that's, that was basically the last thing was what I, you know, really kind of realize over this past week that kind of like how my feelings that I behave like that sometimes or I think that way without you know. 

04:10:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… and you also want me, you know, I think it's also important to recognize that everybody finds themselves in those situations and wish that they had reacted differently umm… and uh… so not to be too hard on yourself but at the same time, if you're aware that it's a pattern try to come up with some, some strategies, you're doing very well, I think after the fact and you can bring that into the situation. Even with the easier things and those big ones proves to be difficult. 

04:10:55
AMY Right. 

04:10:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY But with, with smaller things maybe. 

04:11:00
AMY Like with my daughter's health, that's something that's easy for anybody, right. 

04:11:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So good. Okay, then we will see you in three weeks. 

04:11:05
AMY Okay, great. 

04:11:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:11:05
AMY Thank you. 

04:11:10
JON CARLSON Marty, Amy really seemed much more relieved in this session. 

04:11:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I think uh… two things, I think the stress of her grandmother dying uh… as some of that as umm… things have moved on a little bit, just with the funerals happened for example. And the other big stress for her was waiting to find when her daughter has cystic fibrosis, it looks like uh… all the tests have come back negative in this one small test that they are still doing but umm… nothing that she seems terribly concerned about at this point. So that's made a big difference for her. 

04:11:40
JON CARLSON It's nice the way though that you, you use this opportunity though to teach her how surprises can get off track and what she can do about it. 

04:11:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Absolutely. Yeah. 

04:11:55
JON CARLSON Now in this uh… session, she uh… identified these stresses that I think would bother everybody, I mean, child diagnosis or losing a loved one. But then she also talked about another stress, this thing with her mother-in-law and that didn't seem to be to be very realistic. 

04:12:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so this is very nice contrast. In one case, we've… we've got daughters potentially, seriously ill umm… death of her grandmother and in the other case, uh… she was very upset with her mother-in-law for being, for not coming to her daughter's dance recital. We only found about a little bit later in the discussion that her mother actually lived eight hours away in one of the eight hour trip to come in to uh…, to this dance recital and umm… I think it's important with, with any kind of uh… problem with anxiety or perfectionism to, to really distinguish between negative thinking that is realistic versus negative thinking that is… is unrealistic and the cognitive behavioral strategy is would focus or focus much more on changing unrealistic negative thinking, you know, when some of these thoughts are realistic, I think in those cases, using strategies like support uh… problem solving, helping the person maybe to solve this very real problem umm… arousal management steps, relaxation or breathing umm… whereas if the thoughts are unrealistic, we want to focus on changing the thoughts. 

04:13:15
JON CARLSON And so this is where you really teach her to differentiate between the two? 

04:13:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, absolutely and the other thing I noticed that distinction isn't always clear. So people can have a very realistic stressor but still have some unrealist beliefs about that realistic stressor. So even with realistic thoughts, umm… we may still need to work on shifting aspects of the thinking. 

04:13:40
JON CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Now we are getting ready to move on with our final and sixth session Can you set that up for us about how you're going to complete with her. 

04:13:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY The succession we want to uh… continue to build on what we're doing because she's not really she's done for the purpose of this but she still has some work to do uh… in the future and then we also want to set her in addition to reviewing where we're at we want to set her up umm… for working on this turn around in the future, so we want to sort of take stock of wherever we are in therapy and uh… discuss strategies for maintaining those gains and discuss strategies for continuing improvement. 

04:14:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY And that's something that a lot of therapist really don't address this whole idea of, how you maintain or you prevent relapse. 

04:14:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, It's… it's in CBT it's generally uh… a if you know it's going to be the last session it's an important part of that last session the problem isn't some case you don't know what's going to be because people just don't come back… 

04:14:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Sure. 

04:14:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY …later when you can it's an important thing to include. 

04:14:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY That's why session number, six. This is session number six of C.B.T. for problems of perfectionism. 

04:14:55
[music] 

04:15:00
Session 6 

04:15:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Hi Amy, welcome back. 

04:15:05
AMY Thank you. 

04:15:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So this is our sixth session and our final one for the series, umm… so what I'd like to do today is too… uh… ask some questions about where things are at now sort of what uh… what's worked maybe what you'd like to work on in the future, and we can talk a little bit about strategies for doing that I also want to take some time to review the homework, I mean we can start with that, and just talk about how things have gone and… And brainstorm strategies for continue to work on the things you can working on, umm… really you'd like to make sure that we talk about today in addition to those things. 

04:15:40
AMY Not in addition to until what you said. 

04:15:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, great, so uh… you mentioned to me, uh… earlier that you don't have the forms with you but you remember… 

04:15:50
AMY Right. 

04:15:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY …what you did and… and… Okay. So we can talk about that… 

04:15:50
AMY Yeah, so we work very many this time surprisingly, since it was three weeks instead of just two so… I guess that's a good thing. 

04:15:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, Yeah so not, not a lot of episodes things I'd really. 

04:16:00
AMY Mm-hmm. 

04:16:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, So let's talk about the this specific things umm… that you've been working on, so one was to continue working and uh… mixing up the order of books at home and house that been going. 

04:16:15
AMY Well, right now we're in the process of like rearranging the kid's rooms, so the books are all over the floor it's driving me crazy, and then just trying to let it go, 'cause it's not that big deal. 

04:16:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY How long have you been like that? 

04:16:25
AMY Umm… and three days. 

04:16:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:16:25
AMY It is a long time for me to, let there be books all over my daughter's floor. 

04:16:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. You finding it's getting harder with each day or easier actually. 

04:16:35
AMY It's getting harder. 

04:16:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:16:35
AMY Just because you know, I don't know actually but it's just it's got a little bit more bother some but… 

04:16:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so uh… any guesses about why that might be… 

04:16:45
AMY I don't know… I don't know if it's just because like I'm like reaching that threshold of just tolerance. 

04:16:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:16:50
AMY You know, I'm just like, all right, the big the first time I was no big deal and I knew it was and I was like let go. 

04:16:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:16:55
AMY And then, you know the next day like well, all right, it's I don't know… 

04:17:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY In your mind this is something that's not supposed to be that way in your plan is to clean it up… 

04:17:05
AMY Right. 

04:17:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY …after things are rearranged, so umm… In a way it may be it's a little bit different and this is actually helpful it's a little bit different when you're making a decision to make things out of order and to let it be that way then when you've got things out of order and it feels like it's not something you're controlling, your something that's that way because you haven't gotten around to, fixing up the room so it's a good uh… one of things we went I think we probably talked about earlier is when… when you do exposure you set up uh… these challenges and you confront fear situations, one of the things that determines whether exposure is useful or not is, how much control you feel you have in the situation whether it's something you are making a decision to do, versus something that's being imposed on you, and that's why might this might feel different to me. 

04:17:55
AMY Okay. 

04:17:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY It's also in been three days I imagine if it stayed that way for umm… Six months or a year, and I mean I know sitting here right now, it's hard to imagine but to say it did what do you imagine you think in a year, that you'd be pulling out your heritage think you would get used to it eventually. 

04:18:10
AMY I don't know it sounds frustrating. 

04:18:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so it's hard to imagine. 

04:18:15
AMY Yeah. 

04:18:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Okay, what are the other plans was to begin to let your children and your husband do more of the cleaning, you've done the work with that. 

04:18:30
AMY That's probably why I turn these books are all over the floor on a room and not put away. 

04:18:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:18:35
AMY So because umm… we're converting one of the bedrooms into a play room, I told the kids, I'm like you pay these are your spaces, and you guys have to start them the way you want to just be strained, but it's really hard for me just uh… like cokes have all these organization ideas to, how they're going to share the room and how it's going to look inside the set up, and how to design their player room in stuff so… 

04:18:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what's the long… it's a long term plan umm… of the books all over the floor partly because you're moving things right now. 

04:19:00
AMY Yeah. 

04:19:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so… 

04:19:00
AMY But I mean, she has a book shelf in our room that the books. 

04:19:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY She could put things on… 

04:19:05
AMY Could be I mean… I mean we haven't moved the bookcase out or anything it's still right there in. 

04:19:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:19:10
AMY You know she was sleeping bag in the middle of floor… 

04:19:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… 

04:19:10
AMY …'cause she wants it there. 

04:19:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so what's the plan for when the… the organization is done in the how do you plan to just let her have her room the way she wants to be… 

04:19:20
AMY No, no because I mean, I think she's a worry some responsibility that, you know or some respect for her, like her things. 

04:19:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:19:30
AMY You know, and while they're playing they can make as big of a mess as they want within reason, you know, no current on the wall or anything like that but, you know, when they go from like one thing to another that, I'm trying to help teach them that, you know, you kind of clean up as you go, or when you're done with that or before you get to watch a movie or TV show or before you get to have a snack, you have to clean up your room. 

04:19:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:19:50
AMY You know, and it may not necessarily be the way that, I would organize it, or put things away like whether would be alphabetical or whatever but if they're put away, then I needed let that go and just be okay with… 

04:20:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:20:00
AMY …that it's just put away even though it's not, kind of like the dishwasher. 

04:20:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:20:05
AMY You know, if it's put away it's still clean, even though it's not my organizational… 

04:20:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:20:10
AMY …method. 

04:20:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:20:10
AMY You know, so I'm hoping that it will be, that I'll be able to do that. 

04:20:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:20:15
AMY Once we get the rooms changed so… 

04:20:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY That sounds very reasonable, to me yeah. 

04:20:20
AMY It might be harder, but I'm going to do it I'm determined. 

04:20:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what's uh… if we come back, you know, what are your fears if you gave up perfectionism or you gave up some of the rules that everything would be chaos , uh… it's sounds like that's not really where things are going sounds like your goal is really moderation. 

04:20:35
AMY Yeah. 

04:20:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you saw like you've let go of everything but it's also not like you, you need everything to be exactly the way it was… 

04:20:40
AMY Right. 

04:20:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Before so, is that the way it feels? 

04:20:45
AMY Yeah, it's my husband is good like you know, like sidekick for me because he keeps… that's like his line everything in moderation all the time, so like when I kind of get like a little bit anxious or out of control with how things have to be, you know, he can help calm me down or whatever and the fact that I vacant school, you know, I get to organize my things the way, I want to and then I can let the kids have their things organized the way they want to as long as they're put away, they can do it, you know. and say with my husband stuff like you know he's almost 32, I don't need to clean up after him, you know, I don't need to reorganize the dishwasher for him, you know, isn't… he can do it himself for everything. 

04:21:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Did you notice a change in how you're reacting to his way of organizing things? 

04:21:30
AMY Umm…Actually have been pretty good with his stuff. 

04:21:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:21:30
AMY It's the girls and I have a little bit harder time with but I mean, there are a lot younger and I just need to, work with them and not do, it my way but just to straighten up or whatever. 

04:21:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what kind of thoughts pop into your head in terms of thoughts that make you anxious or make you feel like you need to do something. 

04:21:50
AMY Umm… Like with him or just in general? 

04:21:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY With…with the girls. 

04:21:55
AMY With the girls it's just, if they don't do it or if like in the beginning like, when they were putting stuff in like the certain, like the baskets or whatever, they had switched it around, and I talked about this like probably like in the one of the first sessions that, Dylani(ph), like I organized her little people toys in people, animals and accessories, and like when my brother helped clean up one time she got really upset with them she's like no those don't go that way, you know, and now she's kind of switched it all up, and I keep looking and they're going, Oh God! That's not right, and it just drives me crazy and like, you know, like I get tense about it and stuff but then, I just have to let it go. 

04:22:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Now, okay, uh… if we if we look at the thought, so I thought this is just not right in, and anything beyond that, you know, why is that a problem, any predictions about were could happen or… 

04:22:45
AMY I'd like… I'd like logically I know nothing's going to happen. 

04:22:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Well, but it logically he would have any… 

04:22:50
AMY You might, it's just… it's just not right. 

04:22:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:22:55
AMY You know, it's…you know and I can I like joke about their home with my husband and I some of my friends, you know, I joke about like how I don't know, you know, is a bad word but how particular, I am with things but it just I don't know it just like eats away at me. 

04:23:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:23:10
AMY You know, and I know that nothing's going to happen but it just I don't even know what the illogical thoughts are just. 

04:23:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So how uh… how can you deal with it when it happens that feeling. 

04:23:20
AMY Umm… Well, honestly I haven't touched it at all, I don't like rearrange them at all, because they're put away, and that's what I remember is the biggest like that's what the important part not that they're put away my way it's they're clean. 

04:23:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:23:35
AMY They're organized in her style, you know, they're not my toys I don't play with them. So I just, I want the feeling right and just try to not try to forget about it necessarily but just I don't know. 

04:23:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY You will to step back from the feeling ever and look at it as an observer rather than… a participant. 

04:23:55
AMY Yeah, I've been doing that a lot more… 

04:23:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… Yeah, so I'm thinking being able to say, you know, say well we're sort of having that feeling again that that I get sometimes there and being able to recognize it as just that was just one comfortable feeling. 

04:24:10
AMY Yeah, Even feeling like I've been noticing like when things like that come up and it's like, you know, I kind of look at it like how, you know, like (inaudible) would, might look at it, you know, it's like oh good! The toys are picked up, you know, And that's… 

04:24:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right, to get them to shift your thinking. 

04:24:25
AMY Yeah, and that's what I should be proud of because I'm… I have a fear where I'm just going to like make my kids think that if they aren't exactly the way I want them to be then I'm not going to love them or they're not to me excepted or they're not going to be important to me or whatever the case may be whatever thoughts that I might make them feel because of, things I do now or, you know, the older they get the worse I might become with it, you know, and so I just have to remember that, hey they cleaned up I need to praise him for that, and I've been really good about it, I think the past few weeks about just like… 

04:25:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY And success of you going to let it go uh… up here emotionally. 

04:25:05
AMY Hmm… Maybe not as well but, you know, I don't feel like I'm letting it come out in the way I'm reacting or behaving with them. 

04:25:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So your behavior has changed, but your thought is still there. 

04:25:15
AMY A little bit… 

04:25:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:25:20
AMY But like I have to like whenever that part comes up I just have to keep remembering, hey they did a good job they… they clean it up, you know, they did it on their own I didn't have to pester him about anything. 

04:25:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY You believe that when you say it. 

04:25:30
AMY So when I say yeah, but my initial thought is like all its wrong. 

04:25:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:25:35
AMY But then I can remind myself and I'm like, "Hey!" And then, I… I can switch that like I can, I know that that's what's important right and it doesn't bother me as much now that the things are not in my order. 

04:25:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:25:50
AMY So… 

04:25:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you're able to step back and say that's just a father, that's a feeling. 

04:25:50
AMY Yeah. 

04:25:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, how much he believes that, when you uh… if you have to umm… put a number on it where it's the uh… What percent of you believes the… the new thought versus the perfectionistic thought. 

04:26:05
AMY Oh. Like a percentage, Probably. 

04:26:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY After… after you make the shift. 

04:26:10
AMY Oh. Probably at least 85%, I mean it's pretty strong, that I'm like… 

04:26:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, with it. 

04:26:15
AMY Yeah. 

04:26:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, what about before him, before you catch yourself. 

04:26:20
AMY Like what the intensity of the other thought is… 

04:26:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, The actual start of the perfectionistic thought. 

04:26:25
AMY Uh… It's probably a little higher, like 90… Or so like it's… 

04:26:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… so initially the perfectionistic thought is about 90. 

04:26:35
AMY Right. 

04:26:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY …after you make the shift that perfectionistic thought goes down to 15 or 20 or something. 

04:26:40
AMY Right. 

04:26:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, significant yet shift okay. 

04:26:40
AMY Yeah, unlike before working with you right… I wouldn't even like step back and thought of it the other way like I would have just gotten like angry about it or upset about it or I would have just redone it myself in. 

04:26:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:26:50
AMY Like whatever great scene with like the dishwasher whenever my husband of all the dishwasher just kind of like get irritated and redo it myself and, and I just doesn't bother me. 

04:27:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY But other times still where you don't catch yourself. 

04:27:05
AMY Yeah, the other day with the dishwasher. 

04:27:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, (inaudible). 

04:27:05
AMY You know, I thought I was with that but… 

04:27:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY We had a dishwasher episode. 

04:27:10
AMY Yeah, but I mean… 

04:27:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY How many times, is that happening a day where… where you find yourself getting caught up in that, need to have things in a certain way. 

04:27:25
AMY Umm… A day… 

04:27:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Or week or… 

04:27:30
AMY I have not, I say like three or four times a week. 

04:27:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Three or four times a week and what… what might that number of had been when we started. 

04:27:35
AMY Our band at least that much probably a day. 

04:27:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Per day. 

04:27:40
AMY Yeah. 

04:27:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY So it's a significant difference here. 

04:27:40
AMY Yeah. 

04:27:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, great uh… so let me ask you umm… Another thing that we… we haven't talked about for… for a few meetings but it was an issue at the beginning is that uh… some issues around your relationship with your best friend and things last time we spoke about or things were much better and then you come to a new agreement and talked about it things were good has there been any change in that. 

04:28:05
AMY Umm… There's been some like, a couple like tense moments not as much bad as they were previous but on, It tends to happen like if we don't see each other for a while, then I think we kind of get like, just educated with each other easily, I don't know why that is but umm…,you know, like when I'm when I start doing something or I start like getting not, not necessarily getting at her but maybe being a little bit too judgmental about things with her, you know, she's more comfortable now telling me about it. 

04:28:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:28:40
AMY And I can realize it and then I don't necessarily parties for I'm like, oh yeah I thinks, you know. 

04:28:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:28:45
AMY You know, I appreciate her pointing out to me because now I don't always catch it, when I'm doing it, but like she know now that we talked about like what you and I talked about and how I want to recognize my behavior when I'm doing that you know when I want to change it and I want to whatever and you know, so she's I told her like I need you to help me with this I need you to point this out to me so I can become more aware of it, and she's a lot more comparable now, because she was brought up before she died just like it's like. 

04:29:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So that's been good in your relationship. 

04:29:10
AMY Yeah. 

04:29:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, and then when she does that are you able to shift your… 

04:29:15
AMY Yes. 

04:29:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY …to stuff and be happy. 

04:29:20
AMY Sometimes at first I get a little umm… like a defensive. 

04:29:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:29:20
AMY You know, because I feel like she's pointing out my faults, and I don't like being told what I do wrong, you know, I just take it in constructive criticism, I don't take very well usually so most people don't like to be criticized I mean that's the intro, you know, and like when… when she does bring that happened, you know, I kind of get my all defensive, you know, I can feel anxiety, starting up like my heart of start beating faster and I have like a hard time catching my breath little bit well, you know, and I'm like and I will kind of talk about it, and then I come down… 

04:29:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:29:55
AMY …and just kind of going through it. 

04:29:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY But she does talk about it with you, is she feeling hurt by what you've said to her before that, that uh… or are not really. 

04:30:05
AMY No, I think she knows that like so the mail issues and she just kind let go. Mm-mm. 

04:30:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY She isn't taking personally, okay. 

04:30:10
AMY She's a better person (inaudible). 

04:30:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Tell you but you're pairing one of the things we spoke with last time is that, the need to really not fight the panic attacks so they happen to sensations let him go, uh… ride with them, be aware of them, but don't… don't fight them, so if had any panic attacks in the last three weeks? 

04:30:25
AMY Umm… Not, like I've had like the moments where like I said like when I was on the phone with my friend, and she can point something out to me, where I could feel the onset of it. 

04:30:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:30:35
AMY But just like when I talk about things done actually. 

04:30:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:30:40
AMY Where I would even have to think about not fighting it or fighting it. 

04:30:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:30:40
AMY Umm… But actually since we met I've had like a two week break from school, you know, everything with my grandmother's passed, and everything with my daughter being sick is gone, so I've had extremely calm few weeks. 

04:30:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY It's been a good few weeks. 

04:30:55
AMY Yeah, so I haven't had a chance to get real worked up or anything. 

04:31:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Okay, and in the… the last thing we had spoken about was the need to catch yourself, umm… sorry to uh… to deal better with surprises I guess. 

04:31:10
AMY Yeah, I'm (inaudible) all of those still. 

04:31:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, so we… we had one of these which was a possible practice was to have your husband uh… spring some surprises on you. 

04:31:20
AMY Yeah, he's having problems. 

04:31:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY To he's having problems. 

04:31:25
AMY No, he's having fun with us. 

04:31:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Oh! He's having fun, okay. 

04:31:25
AMY Yeah. 

04:31:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what a kind of things uh… has he been swinging on you. 

04:31:30
AMY Umm… I think are one time he had, I think he spilled something on the table and I went to clean it up and he's like, it's like I'll get to it later, and he just let it sit there for like an hour here. 

04:31:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Uh-huh. 

04:31:45
AMY Like every time I got up to clean he's like I told you I get it, and I got just I mean he goes no, I said, I stole that, I'll clean it up because you're not my mum don't take care we to everything. 

04:31:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY And this was something he planned… 

04:31:55
AMY Oh. Yeah. 

04:31:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY …based on your (inaudible). 

04:31:55
AMY Well, he I think you spelled it and then he's just like, all right, let's see how long we can last. 

04:32:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:32:00
AMY People think so… and he even pointed out he goes his like cute, you know, the therapist told you that you have to work us this might have, you know, it's like I'm being supportive. 

04:32:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So was… umm… how did you, so how did you deal with I when it. 

04:32:10
AMY I tried to avoid it, and I tried not to look at the table or do something else like I would get a computer and check my e-mail or I was the one TV. 

04:32:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY You use distraction, avoidance. 

04:32:20
AMY And it didn't work as well as I had hoped, but… 'cause I can still picture in my head. 

04:32:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY So what would another strategy be that the, you could use of that. 

04:32:30
AMY Just clean it… 

04:32:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY So given that your goal is to deal better with surprises and to deal with the sort of unpredictable, uncontrollable of the situation, and I have might, uh… what might have been the way to… to deal with that in a way that would help you to, to be better able to deal with a situations. 

04:32:45
AMY It's not really sure, I did do better with another surprise that, like my husband didn't put I mean or like something happened at work and I wasn't ready for it, and I was like kind of upset about it and I just can't let it go. 

04:33:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Uh-uh, I'll ask you about that, someone hears about that, umm… but let's… let's uh… figure out, a way of handling the that other one first so the umm… let me ask you, let me ask the question differently, umm… If you were going to give the advice to somebody else about, how they might think about a situation like that differently in the moment imagine somebody say it's me uh… something that just for whatever reason that just really gets on my nerves or makes it hard for me to think of anything else, when I went with that spill is there, I want to clean that, what would your recommendation be, other than clean it, again thinking I mean there's two competing goals here, I mean that the one goal is to act out the, what the perfectionism wants you to act out which is to clean it and just get rid of that would get rid of your discomfort right away. 

04:34:00
AMY Right. 

04:34:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Uh… So that's… that's one, one go or the competing goal is the, is the goal of trying to learn to be more comfortable with… with umm… really with, with discomfort were more willing to feel uncomfortable and tolerate, like a discomfort so… 

04:34:15
AMY I just not sure whenever (inaudible) feel uncomfortable. If you can change it, you know, that's… that's the thing I'm having a hard time with is like, if I can change the situation so I'm not uncomfortable from that like feeling frustrated or stressed out, why can't I just change it, but I understand also at the same time that, you know situations come up that I can't change, because I can't control, so I guess like with the whole spilled milk thing, you know, even though I could control it in a way like by changing it, I could change it and it's, you know, it's something minor but… 

04:34:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I mean that the… one of the problems is, umm… If you think about what brought you into this therapy, uh… initially it was that the perfectionism was really causing more problems then, you know, get a little bit perfectionism is great. 

04:35:05
AMY Right. 

04:35:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY You get… get organized, you get things done, you uh… 

04:35:05
AMY You work hard. 

04:35:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY You work hard, and save time, well… well so in some ways it took more time but in other ways, you've got systems that allow you to be more efficient and right in certain areas and things umm… but you came into therapy want to change the perfectionism because or because you told me. 

04:35:25
AMY Well, because I just, I just know that that's a lot of why I get agitated, you know, I get irritated easily with, you know, like I was getting very irritated is with, you know, like I was getting very… I was getting very educated and upset with my friend Julie. 

04:35:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:35:40
AMY You know, and… talking with you, when talking with her about stuff, has really helped that situation, and I'm so grateful for that. 

04:35:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… so the discomfort of the profession as it was causing was greater than any benefit. 

04:35:50
AMY Right. 

04:35:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY That the you have a lot of benefit it as well but, the discomfort was greater and the reason uh… yes so the reason then to, to purposely bring on uh… that feeling of discomfort is to be a part of the… the reason what motivates all the perfections of behavior is the need to have things just right, they need to get rid of any discomfort, and then you know when they need to uh… basically to feel like things are done in a proper way, the way to learn to overcome that, that need or that, that fear of things being uncomfortable is to purposely learn to tolerate feelings of discomfort umm… and if you think of your own experience again you've had a very dramatic, uh… experience in the past where something was very… very difficult and you force yourself to, Confront and deal with and they've got easier, that was the remember… 

04:36:45
AMY Are the bridge… 

04:36:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY The bridges yeah. 

04:36:45
AMY Yeah. 

04:36:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So and you might, you know you can imagine umm… 

04:36:50
AMY No, I can actually like work over into the water… 

04:36:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:36:50
AMY …much before right. 

04:36:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY And you can imagine before you had to get over that fear you might have asked the question well, why should I, why should I, if bridges break up, why should I, put myself through that if I can avoid bridges and, you know, It's not until the discomfort of the costs of having a problem are greater than the benefits that that people start to think about overcoming a fear, we all have fears most of us don't bother doing (inaudible). 

04:37:15
AMY Right. 

04:37:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… Until, again until there's a reason to umm… and me again what the… the reason was so part of, it was that it was affecting your relationship with your friend, remember any other reasons that. 

04:37:25
AMY For coming in. 

04:37:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, for coming… 

04:37:30
AMY I… I just umm… another big fears Mike with my kids. 

04:37:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:37:35
AMY I just, that's a huge thing for me. 

04:37:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:37:40
AMY Like, I just know how umm… some, some kids grow up like just knowing that their parents expect so much from them and if they do less than what their parents expect that, I don't know I just, I don't want to make my kids feel that awful about themselves, just because they're not, the best at every single thing that they do. 

04:37:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:38:00
AMY You know, and I want them to be happy, and I want them to excel, and I want them to work hard and, you know, make calls and, you know, achieve(ph) but I want them to do on their terms not on mine. 

04:38:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:38:05
AMY It's their life, and as much as they, they are a part of my life, I don't want to and as much as I will be in control of everything, you know, I just I don't have a good relationship with my kids and right now I do, but I'm afraid that if I keep going the direction I've been heading… heading, that I won't… 

04:38:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:38:25
AMY You know and that's, that's a huge thing for me. 

04:38:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yup. 

04:38:25
AMY You know. 

04:38:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY And I think… I think it's a great reason to, to work on this as well so… so yes so the reason too, to be more comfortable with the spill, isn't because you want to be comfortable with spills generally, In fact once you, once this is an issue, it's fine to clean up spills. 

04:38:45
AMY Right. 

04:38:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY It's uh… it's more, uh… If you find that you…. you're terrified not to clean it up, maybe don't know if terrified or fear is the right word but it's just extremely uncomfortable, not to clean it up even you know and you know it's going to be cleaned up eventually as I stay that way, but if waiting is very… very uncomfortable umm… then… then that's that might be a good opportunity to practice, learning to tolerate that this discomfort, so that when other situations come up as you said earlier, you can sort of carry that, uh… into other situations and basically just say uncomfortable but, but so what umm… It's just a feeling, it's it will pass it always does uh… that spills eventually going to clean that, will be different think of a spill if you had a nice wood table the spill was going to stain it or something but I assume that wasn't the case. 

04:39:35
AMY No, wasn't the case, so it wasn't figured out how should move or anything like that, they would ruin the wood. 

04:39:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… So yeah so I would just think of this as an opportunity to practice, the same way that if you're afraid of bridges, I might recommend you go over all kinds of different bridges, and you… in any one practice you would not need to go over the bridge in that moment, but that practice would help you later for where you need to go over basically, so this, of course, is much better if you can come up with practices that are relevant in that that are specifically things you want to get more comfortable with and I think the dishwasher was one… 

04:40:10
AMY Yeah. 

04:40:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… that might, uh… those reading better to, to practice those kinds of things, and the other surprises that your husband uh… so I think that I would try to remember backward thinking that part of what, what uh… we talked about his having him surprise you with, with routine like… the things that would break up your routine a little bit late, let's go out now or you know 

04:40:35
AMY Well, yeah. we did that and he called my mom I had a time I got her to baby sit this past week and he's like, we're going to movies and like is nice is that wise I'm just like, I'm like well we have stuff that we have to get done around the house we had plans for today that like things that we wanted to do, we want to start working on our landscaping. 

04:40:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:40:50
AMY …and stuff goes up too bad, for one of us. 

04:40:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:40:50
AMY So and isn't… I mean that was like a fun thing to do instead off, so it was a little bit easier for me to accept but it still was kind of hard for me because I'm just like you know we have this stuff that we have to get done. 

04:41:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:41:05
AMY You know, but like he said, he's like that's going to, we're not going to were still going to be working on it tomorrow anyways, so why not just do it all tomorrow… 

04:41:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:41:10
AMY …everything. 

04:41:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So you went, you went with it in. 

04:41:15
AMY Mm-hmm. 

04:41:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Was it… was it okay in the end. 

04:41:15
AMY Yeah, I got (inaudible), it was good. 

04:41:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Perfect! One of the big movies, uh… Christmas. 

04:41:20
AMY Yeah, I know Spiderman three, so is good movie. 

04:41:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY I wasn't… it was going to uh… good umm… any other surprises like that you got him. 

04:41:30
AMY Umm… One, he messed didn't necessarily do, umm… but we were supposed to have like a big cookout with a bunch of friends at her house, and because one of my daughters was sick umm… we had to cancel, and I was extremely disappointed, and it can ruin my day but, you know. 

04:41:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY So that was just a surprise that… the came up… 

04:41:50
AMY Right. 

04:41:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY …anyway. 

04:41:50
AMY And like in the beginning I was just like, you know, I was really upset about it and stuff and I was like, you know, this so what happens when you have kids just, you know, he kind of talked about it or whatever and I… I got over it and it didn't take long to get over it and stuff but. 

04:42:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Remember what the thought was that was made this upsetting for you, how… how you viewed it as an interpreter. 

04:42:10
AMY Well, I haven't seen so in my for these people and like several weeks or a couple months, you know, because things were hectic with school for me and then with their jobs for them and stuff like that and, you know, we're all looking forward to getting together and, you know, girl an hour and have a couple beers and just like hanging outside, it was a gorgeous day and, you know, it's like, you know, I was just I think I was just really just really frustrated that like these fun plans were just ruined. 

04:42:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:42:35
AMY You know so it's frustrated and, you know, umm… and then we you know because I know that we're not to be able to get together until June. 

04:42:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:42:40
AMY You know, and this was like and on the very beginning of the end of April actually, so (inaudible) you're right, well, that's another month and a half is going to go by without me. I guess having like a fun moment with our friends or whatever and, so it's disappointing and I was, you know, sad about it and over it. 

04:43:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY That that do you feel like that it last too long feeling, or was a too intense or was it that if normal. 

04:43:05
AMY No, it… it wasn't too intense and I was really proud of the way that I like dealt with it, because usually I just like, but it ruin my whole day, you know, but… you know, we got some other stuff around the house down that we normally would know because we're people commit over, you know, and so, you know, we kind of switched our focus and, you know, switched it up which I don't usually do well with change or like anything so. 

04:43:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Tell me about the surprise at work that uh… you said something happened at work. 

04:43:35
AMY Well, I don't know if it was a surprise, but umm… it was like a intense moment at work. I work on a rehab for, in a hospital and we usually don't get very many codes, like umm… anything horrible happen to our patients because they are not medical patients, they are rehab patients and we had a code ABC, which is Airway Breathing and Circulation and it was just like people running all over the place and all the staff and it was just a really intense moment and I was really proud the way I like just… I got in there, I got the crash card in there and, you know, I'm not a nurse or anything, so I kind have to stay outside the room and drag people away from the room whatever but, you know, I like reacted really positively, you know, extremely intense surprising moment that you have no control over whatsoever and umm… you know, having the transfer the patient off the floor to a medical floor after that and then she died later that night and it was really hard for me, I've known this patient for the long time umm… but you know, it was… I was really proud myself for just… getting in there and being able to do it, without like freaking out or… 

04:44:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY That's great. So you tend to do it well with real crisis from that happened? 

04:44:45
AMY Yeah, I don't know (inaudible) that is when I can't deal with, you know, books on the floor. Huh. I guess your (inaudible) going in and I like kind of stuff and… 

04:44:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY Just kind know what to do in that… that situation. 

04:44:55
AMY Yeah. 

04:44:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY No time to really think about it. 

04:44:55
AMY Yeah, that's fighter flight response whatever you just get in there do it, because you just don't even have time to think about it, so but I was really proud of myself because I have never been part of the cord. 

04:45:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, that's great! 

04:45:10
AMY Not that there outcome was positive, but, you know… 

04:45:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY That you're able to deal with a stress when it was like… 

04:45:15
AMY Hmm. 

04:45:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Umm… What… So like in terms of planning for the future, what kinds of things that we go with this therapy is not necessarily especially in successions to completely change everything umm… but rather to give you the two also you need to be your own therapist when we're done, so what kinds of two or three feel like you have now that you can take forward? 

04:45:40
AMY Umm… Well, like the whole thing with my kids organizing their own room, or not necessarily organizing, but cleaning up on their own. I think I had gone into that, have it now or not have it, but like the whole thought process, and its taking me a while and I still have that initial thought that like its not done my way, but then I'm able to rethink it and be okay with those new thoughts that, that they cleaned up to everything, you know, and things like that so… 

04:46:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY And new things that are going to come up is your children get older, they're going to play with friends you don't like and then they are going to come home little later and they aren't supposed to and not do their homework when you want them to do their homework and there's going to be new… new issues that you haven't any other chance to practice uh… and how you're going to care, what… what…. what more general skills do you have that you carry forward into these new situations that arise? 

04:46:30
AMY Umm… I don't know I think part of it, the whole home work worksheet really helps me out and I'm hoping that the more I do that the more natural that will become for me and I think that like even though now it still like I have to work at changing my thought process that even though down the road and like a few years when the girls are playing like you said with people that I don't necessarily approve of whatever that, they'll just become natural to me to like try to rethink things a little bit without having the like think too hard on it, you know, and umm… like I realize I can't like plan everything out and I have to okay with that and, you know, like I said I can't control everything that I do and I don't want it… I don't want to want to control everything that they do, you know, I want to be independent thinkers and self sufficient umm… but I think that… like like working on with those worksheets and stuff that hopefully that all just become part of my routine, like I don't have to right everything out, it will just kind of… 

04:47:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY You'll be thinking, threw in your head. Yeah, yeah, then that should be happen over time. And what… what… there can times where its not gonna be… uh… Again the whole of this isn't to have no limits or no, you know, we want your kids to… to have… to have sort of appropriate limits on what they do and don't do… They're gonna be times where you may not be sure how much of umm… what your watching from your children or from other people in your life is just good parenting and how much of it is perfectionistic parenting. 

04:48:05
AMY Yeah. 

04:48:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY How can you make that distinction? 

04:48:10
AMY I'm not sure. 

04:48:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Uh… Hey. Guesses if you have a moment where you're not sure? 

04:48:20
AMY I can try to look at it from somebody else point of view, you know, thinking, I mean, a lot of reference or ma'am that I know that they don't, most of them don't take things as far as I do with expectations, lot of them see… At least they come across and want to lay back and I don't know if I can come across lay back or not to them umm… but, you know, like a lot of times when I'm doing some with the kids and I'll get little frustrated or anxious or whatever, you know, I'm… I'll sit back and be like how would Robin deal with this? to everything and that's saying that Robin is a better parent than I'm or whatever but Robin might respond better to certain situations than I do, so I kind of try to think of like how other people might respond to that situation and then I kind of think that, you know, I'm not going over board with this situation, this is okay for me be feeling this way or thinking this way. 

04:49:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY That's exactly what I was thinking, yeah, just… just checking either just to try to imagine what Robin or somebody else might think or even asking and I know when I'm…. 

04:49:15
AMY I have a hard time with that. 

04:49:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Did? 

04:49:15
AMY Yes. 

04:49:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, why is that? 

04:49:20
AMY I think it shows that I'm… I'm weak and as much as I love for people to come to me for advice, I'm like parenting issues or whatever or anything at all it makes me feel like they think highly of me, I still have it and I know it's not right, but I still have that thought that like if I go to someone that gonna be like, oh, she's (inaudible) I thought she was, or she doesn't have it all together like I thought she does or she did or whatever and that's still hurt my feelings and that's gonna to be real hard… it's really hard for me to ask for help. 

04:49:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY What does some other things that people might think if you go to them for help? One is that your crappie mother and that's why you've to go for help. 

04:50:00
AMY But I don't… like I know I really don't think that they're gonna sit there and go. God! Amy is a horrible mom. 

04:50:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY What're they gonna… What're they gonna think if you go and ask for help? 

04:50:05
AMY Well… I don't… I don't know what they may…. Some of them might think, hey, even she needs help sometimes or you know, may be there… it would, you know, boost us self-esteem as a parent, you know, thinking that, you know, that I think they're doing is… is good, you know. 

04:50:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Any chance of about thinking you're asking for help makes you a better parent? 

04:50:25
AMY That's actually could one. Huh… But I… I have it… I don't tend to think that way when it comes to me asking for help, seven though I might think that somebody else, it's…. 

04:50:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY I was thinking like that. I… I… I've learned when I'm frustrated with the situation, I'm ready to fire off an email about something that… that… you know, is frustrating me. I always get… if she is around I wish that my wife to read it before I send it umm… and my… and she used to change a few words and that's me know, the sentence could actually send that person and, you know, that lead to a different outcome that you're looking forward umm… you know, one way of looking at that is that I'm weak because I've to ask her help and I can figure it out of my own and the other way looking at it that I'm really smart because I… before sending it off, I got help with that situation, not that really smart but…. but it's an another way…. It's another way of…. just another way of looking at that, that it's actually positive trait to be able to ask for help and that's something… 

04:51:25
AMY Something that I've to work on. And I'm okay with asking my husband for help, because he lives with me day in and day out and he knows that I've thoughts and everybody knows that everybody has faults but I just don't want people to know what mine are. I just don't want them to see it, you know, I like people thinking that I'm good at this and I'm great at that, I mean, everybody does, like no one wants to feel like they're failure at. 

04:51:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY You think any of you friends think you're perfectionistic mother? 

04:51:50
AMY My friend Julie that was, huh, yeah. 

04:51:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY She think that… She think that's a good thing as a… as a parent, or do you think she thinks you're may be little too perfectionistic as a parent. 

04:52:00
UNKNOWN No, I think she thinks it's a good thing, but I don't know if she would carry on with that herself when she has kids. 

04:52:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:52:05
AMY You know. 

04:52:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… So Julie, for example if you asked her for advice and she might back, I can imagine, if I was Julie and I thought you're overly perfectionistic that you can ask me, might being too perfectionistic here, sorry Julie, I think well, Amy is actually trying to be less of a perfectionistic with her kids and that's really good, you know, I may actually see that as a positive if I would. 

04:52:30
AMY Yeah, well, with Julie I'll ask her for advice to even though she doesn't have kids. She is around my kids constantly. 

04:52:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:52:35
AMY And I… I'm okay with her knowing… 

04:52:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:52:40
AMY Like that I need some advice on certain things but even with her I like if umm… my husband and I don't fight often but we usually get like have like one big major thing a year. And the last we had one, I couldn't go to work because I want her to think that my marriage… marriage is just like the marriage to have and that's awful that I cant even go to my best friend when I want shoulder to cry on you know, and I just… I kind of need to get over that. 

04:53:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:53:05
AMY Asking for help… 

04:53:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So that's… 

04:53:10
AMY Or letting my guard down or what ever the case may be. 

04:53:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY So how would you do that? 

04:53:15
AMY Start slowly. 

04:53:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY So taking risks and… 

04:53:15
AMY Yeah. 

04:53:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY And trying and see what happens 

04:53:20
AMY Yeah, and uh… like just asking people that I feel comfortable with. 

04:53:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:53:25
AMY If they can say no, I ask Pete all the time but like I said he knows all my faults so… 

04:53:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So eventually a lot of people actually liked… you know there… there is again moderation, I can imagine that. Yeah if you are in friendship with somebody and they calling you every two minutes to advice about every single possible thing that… that might drive people crazy… 

04:53:45
AMY Right. 

04:53:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY I mean they wouldn't or they'd see you then as… as being too needy or something like that. 

04:53:50
AMY Mm hmm… 

04:53:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY On the other hand umm… you know friendship or relationship is somebody you never needs advice, who never needs help umm… that doesn't necessarily strengthen a relationship. 

04:54:00
AMY Yeah, that would irritate me. 

04:54:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:54:00
AMY If… if I had a friend like me, that would irritate me. I know I would. 

04:54:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY So umm… so what does that tell you? 

04:54:10
AMY That I just need to let go of that. 

04:54:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY And just… 

04:54:10
AMY I just need to know that it's okay to ask for help. I need to know that it's umm… that it's okay not to necessarily show that I am weak because I don't think that I ask like when people ask me for help I don't think they are weak for it. I don't think they are less of anything for it you know, in fact I am actually impressed with like their courage to ask for help and show that they don't know what they're doing all the time. 

04:54:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:54:35
AMY You know, like my one friend Robin, she is like how did you potty trained Eleni, because she's having hard time potty training her kid. 

04:54:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Mm huh… 

04:54:40
AMY You know, and I was glad to offer that advice but then I don't have that same courage to return the favor and ask her for advice on things that I know she's been successful at. 

04:54:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay… okay so that… that could be something to look at as we go forward and then again just using the same con-strategies you've been using looking at the thought… 

04:54:55
AMY Mm hmm… 

04:55:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Trying to think of other possible ways of they may interpret things umm… and… and taking the risks and see… see what happens umm… any… any thing else that you uh… imagine that you would like to continue working on and then in this short of next few months? 

04:55:15
AMY Umm… There's something that we really didn't get in too much or actually at all we mentioned at the very first session and its like an other control thing that I have and its with eating and that's something that I need to work on but that's just a very touchy thing for me and its really hard because I wont even… I wont even talked to my husband about it. 

04:55:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:55:30
AMY So… 

04:55:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY So that's something nobody else knows about it pretty much? 

04:55:35
AMY Mm hmm…no one… 

04:55:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:55:40
AMY So I mean my husband knows that I had problems on past with it but I think he thinks that like I have stopped and like we have like a little code like when I wanted to go to bathroom afterwards and throw up after eating like I would just tell him like I would say something he would you know this was before we even had kids he would be just like just lets go out for walk you know until you don't feel so full or you don't… 

04:56:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Mm hmm… 

04:56:05
AMY You know you don't have that you know just that urge to go do that you know umm… and he was like a great support sets… support system for and I also like gave him like my (inaudible) when I was doing it. Like you know that if I am doing these certain things. 

04:56:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:56:20
AMY You know, and umm… well then I kept doing it when he wasn't around or what ever and then I changed my sighs. 

04:56:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:56:30
AMY You know, so I think he thinks that its gone and its not and its something I need to work on but that's just I don't know if I can… I don't know if I can do that with him or with anybody like that I am forced to help… 

04:56:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:56:45
AMY I think I would have to talk to someone about that. 

04:56:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Is that something you can imagine seeking therapy for? 

04:56:45
AMY Yeah. 

04:56:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:56:45
AMY Because I don't I know I can't do it on my own, I've been trying for a very long time and I just I can't so… 

04:56:50
MARTIN M. ANTONY Would you be able to see a good work book umm… on that topic? 

04:56:55
AMY Yeah. 

04:57:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay, so when… when we are done, I can… I can recommend some books on that. 

04:57:00
AMY Okay. 

04:57:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. Umm… only got a couple of minutes left, umm… is there anything else you would like to talk about before we are done? 

04:57:10
AMY Umm… Not that I can think of, I do appreciate all your help with everything because I know I have seen some big changes with things especially with my best friend. 

04:57:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Mm huh… 

04:57:20
AMY And stupid little things like a dish washer… 

04:57:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Right. 

04:57:25
AMY What ever but umm… I think it gonna be extremely helpful with the way I deal with my kids. 

04:57:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Great. 

04:57:30
AMY You know… 

04:57:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, and the skills you use with the dishwasher or even before we met with the bridge that you just figured out on your own are… are the same skills that you can use with… with uh… any new situations that arise. 

04:57:45
AMY Mm hmm… and I have to remember that even though its new situation that the same like techniques would work. 

04:57:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:57:50
AMY Because that's what its gonna be hard for me its like you know if I am doing okay with this and then something new comes up and then I just like break down and like start having anxiety takes it you know I had to remember that this will be effective. 

04:58:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah. 

04:58:00
AMY For that too. 

04:58:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY And you can go back uh… we haven't talked much about the readings lately but uh… you know the books you've got will… 

04:58:05
AMY Yeah. 

04:58:10
MARTIN M. ANTONY Only books you can go back to and if you find in six months things start to get uh… a little harder again… 

04:58:10
AMY Yeah. 

04:58:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY And you can also if you uh… if you do find that you would… you would like a therapist near you as well you can contact me and I am happy to recommend people in your area. 

04:58:20
AMY Thank you. 

04:58:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY So… 

04:58:25
AMY Appreciate it. 

04:58:25
MARTIN M. ANTONY Good, okay well, thank you gain fordoing this. 

04:58:30
AMY Thank you. 

04:58:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Okay. 

04:58:30
AMY Martin, since we are at the end of our program and this was the final session, can you recap what is that you've accomplished in these six sessions with Amy? 

04:58:40
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I think we began to make a… a dent to her perfectionism. Umm… She is more willing to let things be out of place at home, she is more willing to let her husband uh… take control of a certain situations in the house, letting the dish washer. She is more willing to tolerate uh… changes in plans than she was a little. She saw this work on these areas but we've seen some change there. We've also seen a… a real significant change in her relationship with her best friend and that's something changed after they had a talk and… and really that change is continued over time. 

04:59:15
JON CARLSON Mm-hmm… so over all you were pleased with the progress that she'd made? 

04:59:15
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, over all is very happy with the progress that she made again I wouldn't say she is not a perfectionist any more I mean she's still have some work to do but there's been some significant changes as well. 

04:59:30
JON CARLSON Now, frequently in… in therapies, therapist we think we did a good job but it… we don't really know how the clients reacted or what they thought. What I did after this last session is I met with Amy to kind of get her opinions about therapy with you over these six sessions. It seems like both you and Amy were pleased about the therapy. 

04:59:55
MARTIN M. ANTONY I think uh… its nice to see that she… she had a positive experience. 

05:00:00
JON CARLSON Mm hmm… yeah, you were really both on the same page. 

05:00:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY Hmm… 

05:00:00
AMY And know, making a lot of progress and this was after six sessions and I get the feeling though there is still some more work that needs to be done. If you could have say six more, twelve more sessions what would you wanna do? 

05:00:20
MARTIN M. ANTONY Yeah, I think uh… I deal with somebody like Amy, I would want to have an other uh… you the ten sessions or so and the kinds of things I would want to work on first of all the things we have been working on just changing some of them day to day rules about in her life things we want to continue work on. She still have some work to do uh… in that regard. Umm… I think it would be nice to bring in her husband to make sure that he is on board and… and not doing things to reinforce the perfectionism and that she is… she's doing a pretty good job at communicating with him but just have him come in and discuss some of his perceptions of how things were going would be helpful. The other thing that I think is uh… really important in Amy's case is the… the issue of the self-induced vomiting. 

05:01:00
AMY Yeah. 

05:01:00
MARTIN M. ANTONY The body image she is I think we just didn't touch on it in these six sessions uh… and umm… that's an area that… that I would want to either work on with her myself or refer her to somebody specializes more on eating disorders to… to work on them some that she sees as… something that she wants to change. 

05:01:20
JON CARLSON Another issue was that of her daughter two and seeing her daughter becoming a perfectionist do you need to make an intervention or will Amy's changed just model for her daughter? How to be different? 

05:01:35
MARTIN M. ANTONY You know, we… we have done that uh… bit already so she is uh… Amy is now seeing that as a goal to help her daughter to mix things up a bit so they did that with their baking. 

05:01:45
AMY Mm hmm… right. 

05:01:45
MARTIN M. ANTONY At one point of their therapy they were they had to bake every Friday and umm… Amy made that change where they went to library one Friday and her daughter was all upset she was like no… no we have to bake on Friday and they went to the library and their daughter had a great time and Amy use that as an example for an opportunity to… to show her daughter that its okay to make changes so umm… 

05:02:00
AMY You wouldn't need to do anything else with that, do you think its just gonna take care of itself? 

05:02:05
MARTIN M. ANTONY My guess is that her daughter is so young that at this stage probably would take care of itself umm… but something we would wanna watch for if it comes an issue then uh… there might be something that we… somebody might have to intervene with it at some point. 

05:02:20
AMY Well, I am sure I am speaking on behalf of our viewers who's very enjoyable to watch you work with Amy and to see the positive progress that was made. 

05:02:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Thank you very much. 

05:02:30
AMY Thank you Martin. 

05:02:30
MARTIN M. ANTONY Thank you.
