DR. WINNIE KING If your child shows signs of Schizophrenia, is there anything that can be done to find out right now on keeping kids healthy. 

00:01:05
Keeping Kids Healthy. 

00:01:10
DR. WINNIE KING Hi, I am Dr. Winnie King, in the lobby of The Children's Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. What would you do if your nine year old son started telling you he is hearing voices or having hallucinations? Well hallucinations can sometimes be signs of a severe mental illness called schizophrenia. In most cases the first signs of schizophrenia don't appear until the teens, but sometimes it can happen earlier. That if symptoms do develop before a child turns thirteen, it is called Childhood Onsets schizophrenia or COS. And if your son or daughter does shows signs of COS, you need to reach out for help. Now here is one family story. 

00:01:55
NARRATOR This is the Orton family Meredith Ed and their two children Maggie and Parker beautiful photos of a happy family. Everything seemed perfectly fine and normal. 

00:02:05
Parker as a baby rendered every stranger in sight it was just a lot of fun. 

00:02:10
Tell hi camera? 

00:02:10
Hi camera? 

00:02:15
MEREDITH Parker's Parents He was really interested in everything, but he was different he was always thinking about the meaning of words and the logic of how things would fit together he was always really good enough and good at just. 

00:02:30
NARRATOR But then the first signs of trouble appeared slowly things started derail. 

00:02:35
He went through periods of being anxious, he went through periods where he was inattentive. 

00:02:40
ED ORTON Parker's Father He had a fairly classic set of ADD symptoms in the third grade and he responded to medication, I mean this very remarkable as like day and night just take the pill and you know within minutes he was just like completely different kid. But then in the fourth grade in the fall he became increasingly kind of distant. I can remember seeing at the dining table and we were working at him and a… he was just a… not in our universe at all. And you could speak to and he would not respond and he was just kind of laughing and talking. 

00:03:25
MEREDITH It was that Christmas time in (inaudible ) when he was nine and a half was when we noticed Parker was like looking into the sliding glass door and responding to the mirror. He was interacting with the door more than he was interacting with us. That I didn't recognize that that as a hallucination and I did really think in terms of hallucinations until after that. 

00:03:55
ED ORTON And then he became just floridly psychotic and so he became a potential threat to his family members. He voiced to me that he wanted to hurt his mother and he had actually dreamt some far off ways of… of doing her harm. So at that point it is was more or less necessary to… to harm. I moved him this setting and get him into place where he was, you know, safe. 

00:04:25
NARRATOR First Parker was hospitalized his parents struggled to find a right doctors. They got misdiagnosis ranging from bipolar disorder to psychosis caused by a tick bite. Finally they discovered that the National Institutes of Health was running a free clinical schizophrenia trial in the Western Maryland. And in Maryland their looming suspisions were confirmed. Parker was diagnosed with COS, Childhood Onset Schizophrenia. 

00:04:55
MEREDITH And the doctor said and I said well congratulations he qualifies to be a NR Schizophrenia trial and I think that hardest day. That was the day that I had to like go with so much hope that it was something smaller and more manageable. I guess at first I really thought like I'd lost him, truly lost because it was his as if there were seventy six televisions stations on in his head. And seventy five of them had nothing to do with reality and mostly inappropriate. And he didn't have control of the clicker and so… you know I was… I was at the point of saying squeeze my hand if you can hear my voice. And so you really felt that you lost the child. 

00:05:50
NARRATOR The impact on Parker's parents where shattering but the Parker's memories of the time are less clear. The slurred speech you will hear is a side effect of his medication. 

00:06:00
PARKER I think I remember people telling me that I didn't really pay much attention to what was going on. I remember… always feeling upset. I was just depressed. I was worried… that I would leave the faucet on and then the house would fill up with water and the walls would burst. That's something I remember worrying about that I didn't need to. 

00:06:25
NARRATOR A lot of Parker's memories are vague but the one thing he will never forget even though he was only nine is the diagnosis. 

00:06:35
PARKER I remember the day the guy said schizophrenia. 

00:06:45
WINNIE KING I remember when this guy said schizophrenia it is a devastating diagnosis and is made even harder by the difficulty of getting it right. Even trained psychologist often make mistakes about schizophrenia so a parent had to be relentless about getting the right help. That's how the orders mount up at the National Institutes of Health for Parker's diagnosis. Nitin Gogtay remembers it well. 

00:07:05
NITIN GOGTAY , MD Child Psychiatry Branch, NIMH When Parker hear the word schizophrenia he simply, he looked at us and said that, does this mean my life is over. 

00:07:15
NARRATOR It was a profound question and to understand the answer, you have to understand what schizophrenia really means. 

00:07:25
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN , MD Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research I think it is not an exaggeration to say that schizophrenia is perhaps one of the most misunderstood illnesses of all time. The common misconception of schizophrenia is that it means split personality and it is absolutely not that what so ever. 

00:07:40
NARRATOR The actual symptoms of schizophrenia can be divided into two categories, positive and negative. 

00:07:45
Positive Symptoms 

00:07:50
JUDITH RAPOPORT , MD Chief, Child Psychiatry Branch, NIMH They have hallucination, delusions which would be positive symptoms. They will become paranoid, they will announce to their parents the food is being poisoned, that they hear voices telling them terrible things to do. And the voices quickly become quite continuous. 

00:08:05
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN Majority of these kids that we see at in our age I would say they are hallucinating actively or profoundly almost about ninety five percent of their awake time. 

00:08:15
Negative Symptoms 

00:08:15
JUDITH RAPOPORT They withdraw from social interactions, lose interests in an activity in interacting is so called negative symptoms. 

00:08:25
Loss of Cognitive Skills 

00:08:25
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN Kids stop doing thing that they were able to do. For instance simple things like being able to take shower, or being able to eat their own meals and they literally lose these abilities. And we have had kids for instance who have IQ of 140, 150 so very high functioning kids and by the time they come to us for screening they are barely able to write their name of the piece of paper. It is a total devastation for the child in terms of their ability to functioning in school and day to day functioning, activities of daily living, every single aspect. 

00:09:00
NARRATOR In Parker's case the symptoms were already clear. 

00:09:00
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN Parker's psychotic symptoms were very profound. He was expressing that he was hearing voices, and seeing things, and he had paranoid delusions. Parker is a very intelligent boy but he was so unavailable for interactions as his parents would describe him constantly being in a fog. 

00:09:20
NARRATOR Over time studies have shown that there is a strong hereditary component to schizophrenia and that there are actual physical manifestations of the disorder inside the brain. 

00:09:30
JUDITH RAPOPORT For our patients the most noticeable thing is during childhood and adolescence they are losing grey matter, they are losing cortex. It is pretty clear to us that this is a brain disease. We think it is genetic at any age but we have some sense that it is more genetic in the children. 

00:09:50
NARRATOR But regardless of the cause, young people with schizophrenia are stigmatized. 

00:09:55
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN There is such your stigma associated with hearing voices and being psychotic. We have had kids where they would be constantly hearing voices and talking to the voices, reacting to the voices but if you stop them and ask them, are you hearing voices, they will stop hold themselves and say no not really. And because at some level they want to be not hearing voices or they want to fell normal. 

00:10:25
NARRATOR But can a normal life really be in these children's future what is the prognosis? 

00:10:30
JEFFREY LIEBERMAN At least in my experience I think this is the most severe illness I have seen in so many ways in regards than actually any field of medicine I have been in. What we see in childhood on schizophrenia is that these kids get sick, they become sick and they stay sick. It's a diagnosis that is going to very likely stick with them for the rest of their life, once the illness has set in its nothing but utter devastation. Lot of these parents are and families very high functioning families and lot of times they just don't came and hit their child. And they feel like they are just literally lost their child. 

00:11:15
WINNIE KING If you have a look through at yourself it is hard to imagine but that kind of loss feels like to a family but in that loss of the old Parker a new Parker is emerging. Five years after his illness began Parker is making progress. 

00:11:30
MEREDITH Once he got stabilized on better medication I remember walking to the mall one day. And he saw a butterfly and I just I felt a little hope then because he actually say something that was real and commented on it. 

00:11:50
PARKER When I first got sick I wasn't happy and that now I am happy most of the time. Over all I am happy. 

00:12:00
MEREDITH I am very proud of how he is still in with it and doesn't give up and he just… its part of his life and he is going on. 

00:12:10
NARRATOR But despite Parker's improvement achieved with the help of heavy medication and regular therapy sessions, he is still facing a considerable daily struggle. 

00:12:20
ED ORTON There's a number of different… symptoms that there are… that… im… are impacting him. I think that the kind of cognitive dysfunction is definitely distressing to him that he just can't think clearly, he can't put two ideas together. 

00:12:40
MEREDITH It's a disorder of his… side his it is almost as if somebody struck a blunder in his head and turned it on high. I guess its may be harder for me to deal with the reality itself. His illness in the sense that one of the things that I think is fairly common to patients with schizophrenia is that they will focus in one person or one idea. And I happened to be the one person that bugs him. 

00:13:10
PARKER It just bothers me the way she talks sometimes. She says something I don't like the way she says it and then I get upset with her. 

00:13:25
MEREDITH On the other day he was very, very proud him we were driving in car and he was going on and on about I hate the way you say this na… this na… And I was looking at him like I need a break and then he just turned away from me for about fifteen seconds and then turned back and said, sorry mom sometimes I just can't control it. And I said that was really good what made you, what allowed you to do that. And he said well I… I saw how sad you looked. 

00:14:00
NARRATOR And then there are the hallucinations there are much less frequent then they used to be but in the milder form they are still there. 

00:14:05
NITIN GOGTAY A lot of people don't pick up on fact that he is having hallucinations. 

00:14:10
MEREDITH I think probably three or four times a day, I would say he has a hallucination what I recognize that he is… he is gone, he is focused on the hallucination. 

00:14:25
NARRATOR Here is what they look like on motile a very shuttle hallucinations that occurred while we were interviewing Parker. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:45
PARKER A little bit of the time they scare me but it used to be all the time. When I hallucinate sometimes it makes it hard for me to concentrate. It's kind of a bummer. 

00:15:05
NARRATOR And Parker's challenges impact the rest of the family too. His sister Maggie has had to grow fast. 

00:15:10
MEREDITH That is hard for your little sister to become a big sister. Just as I felt like I lost a part of Parker the same as too for her. 

00:15:20
MAGGIE ORTON Parker's Sister I guess you have to accept that your sibling is sick and you probably going have to do the best thing that you can for your family because I know at least wasn't thinking so much about the rest of my family. But once Parker got sick I started thinking we were about that I do have to help out my family with this. If my life was a book so if it was like an autobiography, Parker would probably be mentioned on the first page but his illness wouldn't be mentioned. May be in Parker's chapter of the book but probably not you know I… I don't want that to be a headline of my book or something. And I guess that's probably like lot of siblings who are trying and think about. We have kind of fought through this together. 

00:16:20
NARRATOR Parker's parents feel the burden too. 

00:16:25
MEREDITH Well I think… I think it's a puts a… a strain on our marriage in the sense. So it's a system under stress at all times. 

00:16:35
NARRATOR But the family is constantly working to help Parker get better and to get help him to become more independent. 

00:16:40
MEREDITH We kind of actively try to help Parker along with that sense of independence. And so that means that on daily basis you kind of pushing him outside his comfort zone. 

00:16:55
NARRATOR One way they do that is through his Tae Kwon Do class 

00:17:00
PARKER It makes you more flexible. Because, it's very good at Tae Kwon Do, They're always saying to us "Kick higher! Kick higher!" 

00:17:10
MEREDITH He can now ride his bike to Tae Kwon Do on his own and that's a big deal. So as time has gone by and he has responded partially to the medication, I feel like we have him kind of two thirds back. And that he is still there but we only get him to see him through the fog of his illness. And the fog of his illness is going to impact what he can do with his life, what he can achieve in his life and what he can give, its going to be there until they find a medication that really works. 

00:17:50
WINNIE KING There is no one medication that can bring a child all the way back from the father see of us and the ones that do help have side effects ranging from weight gains and vision problems to inflammation of the heart. But medication is still a critical part of the child's treatment. 

00:18:05
NITIN GOGTAY Unfortunately there is no medicine that seems to work magically we feel that Clozapine seems to have the best effects at least in our experience than amongst other medications. When Clozapine works it does seem to show our significant improvement. We feel that when the child is able to say that they are unhappy or they are angry at somebody, we take that as a sign of improvement because that's how much loss of functioning has happened in the child. 

00:18:40
NARRATOR But medication alone isn't enough regular therapy is also critical. Parker's mom Meredith shot this home video of a session with Parker's therapist Dr. Richard Light. 

00:18:50
PARKER Sorry that I yell so at my mom a lot because of the way she talks. 

00:18:55
DR. RICHARD LEIT You want other, your mom's the way she talks and how that bothers you. 

00:19:00
NARRATOR Parker's sessions are based on Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches patients how to better control their thought patterns and how to better manage their behavior. It also focuses on interpersonal skills. 

00:19:10
Meredith's Home Video 

00:19:15
DR. RICHARD LEIT Parker's Therapist The interpersonal piece is important because that's a… a big with COS is… is the social skills deficits that come about. So what we do is we do a lot of work with just talking and being one on one and getting him to relate well to another individual. 

00:19:30
NARRATOR So they might work on how Parker can better respond to his feelings ranging form minor daily concerns to any anger or fear he may feel. 

00:19:40
DR. RICHARD LEIT Parker happens to be very smart and so he is able to use his intellect to understand his symptoms. He is got an… an un… unusual ability, I think to understand the illness and what is happening to him and his symptoms. The other thing he also has is a… is a great family for a lot of family support. 

00:19:55
NARRATOR This support from family friends and the community may be the most crucial element of all. 

00:20:00
NITIN GOGTAY We feel that the kids who have the most effective support system where the parents first of all they accept the diagnosis, they educate themselves, they educate the entire social network and advocate for the child every single step of the way. Those kids tend to do definitely better compared to the kids who do not have such strong support systems. So in a way we feel that it literally takes a village for these kids to keep on moving forward in life. 

00:20:35
WINNIE KING The doctors at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland had become a part of that village. Today the the ordains are on their way back to NIH a trip they make every two years to take part in the on going free study there which now has about a hundred patients diagnosed with COS. Over the next two day Parker and his family will undergo intensive testing ranging from blood work to MRIs. Now there is no doubt about Parker's diagnosis. That is not the case for everyone in this study thirty percent of the children evaluated here for this relatively rare disease, actually turn out to not be Schizophernic. 

00:21:15
Hey come on here. 

00:21:15
JUDITH RAPOPORT This is a brain disease that it is very important to get expert diagnosis because I see both the diagnosis being missed and over diagnosed inappropriately. 

00:21:25
NARRATOR Because of that missed diagnoses problem Dr. Gogtay urges parents to be cautious. 

00:21:30
NITIN GOGTAY What I would say is that the first instance of child expressing that they are hearing voices or seeing things, people should not panic, neither should the practitioners or the treating physicians should jump to the conclusion of Schizophrenia. In fact I would say think of Schizophrenia last. For instance very early ages before pre school before age five or six it is actually normal perfectly normal and healthy kids can hallucinate or experience hallucinations. 

00:22:00
JUDITH RAPOPORT Well great, great majority what they question is raised don't have childhood Schizophrenia. 

00:22:05
NARRATOR But Parker does have COS and while he finds the MRIs a bit unpleasant he knows they play an important part in providing clues that may help researchers find a cure. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:40
NARRATOR Along with the free round the clock here that COS patients receive in NIH including medical care and on sight schooling emotional support is also a vital element for patients and for their families. During his original six months stay at NIH his mother Meredith, was able to stay at a nearby place called the Children's Inn. A serene calming environment where she met other parents trying to cope with their children's illness. Here she met Karin whose son Sam also suffers form COS. 

00:23:10
MEREDITH And I remember just looking at you its like oh she is one of me. And I hadn't had anyone like that before. And I think we just connected then we knew that we were of the… the same species. The mom's of children with this illness. I think as a mom when they pop up with ten fingers and ten toes and its really accelerator there starting to smile at you. And eight weeks later down that I get going at you. 

00:23:40
Think you are other words. 

00:23:45
MEREDITH And you know and you passed the three year old mark and they don't have autism and we have to get past H21 to know that they don't have multiple sclerosis. So you have these mile stones in mind of where things can go wrong. But COS is just its not on that list of things to look for. And until the cloud of schizophrenia has lifted and off, you feel like if there essential being as lost. Their personality is lost. I couldn't go to the grocery store for barely six months I didn't go the grocery store because I just. 

00:24:25
You know I liked anybody you know. 

00:24:25
MEREDITH He can cry all day. 

00:24:25
Yeah. 

00:24:25
MEREDITH He just run out it is too exhausting. And people would look at me with sympathy and I would turn into a puddle of tears. 

00:24:35
NARRATOR But their experiences help them to give coping advise to other parents. 

00:24:40
You know what is like grieving it is a process I think before acceptance. 

00:24:45
MEREDITH But allow yourself the time and the space for that process. I think that's the only way to get through it is to understand the. 

00:24:55
NARRATOR You can't avoid it. 

00:25:00
MEREDITH It's a part of what you have to do. 

00:25:00
NARRATOR And the part of what the parents have to do was face the fierce they have for their children. Parker's father has a very specific fear. 

00:25:05
ED ORTON The medication will lose his, affects he and he will spiral down and wind up living on a street or in jail or something you know. Jails are certainly full of Schizophrenic people who by enlarge and shouldn't belong there by they are there. 

00:25:25
NARRATOR So there are fears but there is also hope. 

00:25:30
MEREDITH Sometime in their life time I hope that there is something that can lift the cloud more of the day. So that he could live the fall life that it looks he was going to have earlier. 

00:25:45
ED ORTON I hope that he would be able to go to college. All I really want for him is to be happy.
