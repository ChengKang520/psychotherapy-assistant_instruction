This is the story around the world, where one or two people become very excited, and begin to do something that makes a difference, and suddenly they feel like they have rediscovered the wheel, and then they find out that there are people in countries next door, who are doing the same thing, or who have done the same thing, this was occurring worldwide.

ART THERAPY Spreading the Word 

00:21:45
[music] 

00:21:55
NARRATOR A major challenge when introducing art therapy in any part of the world, is educating others. From the very beginning, art therapist used the eloquent creations of their patients to demonstrate the power of this new modality, to inform by showing products, and sometimes process. Psychiatrist Guy Roux remembers pioneer Margaret Naumburg spreading the word.

ART THERAPY Establishing Standards 

00:24:30
[music] 

00:24:35
NARRATOR There is often a lack of agreement about what art therapy means, and a need to develop consistent standards. 

00:24:40
Diane Waller - UK 

00:24:40
DIANE WALLER Did some research a while back, and uh I found a very, uh, diverse range of definitions of art therapy. Some countries don't even have something called art therapy, or they have uh artist working in hospitals, which of course is very different. But there are actually organizations that are working to develop some common standards, and training, and practice and the European Consortium of Art Therapy Educators, and uh other individuals that are working very hard in their own country, to develop some kind of structure, for art therapy. 

00:25:20
Karin Dannecker - Germany 

00:25:20
KARIN DANNECKER The profession is not standardized yet, the training is not standardized yet, which is one of our goals to finally eventually have a law, concerning art therapy. Who is able to do that, what should the training be about. But what is most helpful is to really include the artist part, and also the psychotherapy knowledge, and both sides have to come into this profession, and create an identity. 

00:25:50
Edith Kramer 

00:25:50
Jin-Sook Kim - Korea 

00:25:50
JIN-SOOK I think anybody who'd like to start training program, needs to be trained first. Obtain graduate degree in art therapy program, but also to go through clinical training, under supervision, as well as going through therapeutic process of their own. That's really important. 

00:26:25
NARRATOR Setting consistent standards requires working together, as in the Brazilian Union of Art Therapy Association, which include many regional organizations. 

00:26:35
Jin-Sook Kim - Korea 

00:26:35
JIN-SOOK KIM I started to mobilize the Leaders of Art Therapy Field in Korea. Because we all wanted to see art therapy to be some recognized field and we made the standardized the curriculum, we made a booklet we distribute, and recommend them, this is how to become an art therapist. But I think this is really important, because lot of people want to become an art therapist, and market, you know, is huge. But if you don't have any standards, I mean it'd be chaotic, it's already creating a lot of problems. 

00:27:20
Leaders of Art Therapy Field - Korea 

00:27:20
NARRATOR One of the biggest problems is that people say they're art therapist, or offer courses, without proper training themselves. 

00:27:30
Caroline Essame - Singapore 

00:27:30
CAROLINE ESSAME Until the masters was established, people would very often set themselves up as art therapist, having done a few hours training, cuz it was that attractive sounding word. 

00:27:40

00:27:40
Betania Norgran - Brazil 

00:27:40
BETANIA NORGREN Unfortunately, some people make some kind of art, and tell they are making art therapy, and that's not art therapy. I like art therapy so much, I believe in it, but I think uh we need to take care of the quality. 

00:28:00
Nizetta Anagnostopoulou - Greece 

00:28:05
NIZETTA ANAGNOSTOPOULOU So the program is really heavy, it's at least four years, with many hours of practice and supervision. It's very easy to open, because in my country, everybody opens uh centers. But it's very hard to health and serious, training course. 

00:28:20
Art & Psychotherapy Centre - Greece 

00:28:20
Karin Dannecker - Germany 

00:28:20
KARIN DANNECKER Up until now, it's most important to look for a solid serious training, who doesn't only weekend things and then call themselves art therapist, which is one of the major problems here, in Germany still. 

00:28:35
Eva Marxen - Spain 

00:28:35
EVA MARXEN You should have a solid training, in art therapy, but not only in art therapy, but clinical psychology, or psychotherapy, whatever school, yeah. But you have to have the training. 

00:28:50
Jin-Sook Kim - Korea 

00:28:50
JIN-SOOK KIM Not just attend the workshops, or some hours, is not going to make you an art therapist. Everybody want to be art therapist, and everybody think they can be art therapist, without going through training. That's what's going on in Korea. 

00:29:10
NARRATOR Ask to provide evidence that it works, art therapy needs more solid research, especially outcome studies. 

00:29:15
Lena Hero - Sweden 

00:29:15
LENA HERO Learning department and therapeutic department those [ph] in Sweden that want evidence for everything and they are very uh narrow minded in what they call evidence. So it's hard for us to prove evidence based art therapy materials, since Sweden that they will, um approve upon.

JAMES MINSON The research project conducted over the period of two years, resulted in consistent scores on the Anso Casey Life Skills Assessment, in the categories of daily living task, money management, self-care, and social development. Scores on the work and studies habits category were up over 22 percent. The results in the eight part questionnaire administered pre and post study, were also consistent in the categories of the importance of the home, school, church, biological family, foster family, art, the glass studio, and life away from home. 

00:31:05
NARRATOR James showed that art is therapeutic, partly because it helps people to become more organized, cognitively and behaviorally. And mastering any skill while creating something all your own, increases self-esteem. 

00:31:20
ART THERAPY Healing Trauma 

00:31:25
[music] 

00:31:30
NARRATOR But perhaps the most vital reason for the rapid spread of art therapy around the world, is its power to help human beings deal with trauma. In Israel, Hannah Sherebrin developed a dramatic metaphor, using art materials.

00:32:10
Japan 

00:32:10

00:33:50
Judith A. Rubin - US 

00:33:50
JUDITH A. RUBIN We need people who are trained, to help other people. Because, there is so much trauma in the world, from natural disasters, to man-made disasters and people who have been traumatized, don't have words, they become speechless with fear. And being able to create images about those experiences, is a way of not only expressing and articulating what happened, but actually getting some control and power over it. So that it doesn't have control and power over them.

Joy Schmidt - Australia 

00:38:20
JOY SCHMIDT Most people have been trained overseas. Paradoxically that was our strength and also our weakness, because we have relied so heavily, on America and Britain for our knowledge about art therapy. And while it's wonderful, and it's still wonderful, we need to find our own uniqueness.
