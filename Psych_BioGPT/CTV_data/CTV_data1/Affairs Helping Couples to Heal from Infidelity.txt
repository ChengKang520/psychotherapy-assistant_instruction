MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS It's 2:30 in the afternoon and it's a beautiful day and you guys are in here wanting to talk about infidelity. Great. I'm glad you're here. Uhm, just out of curiosity, uhm, how many people heard my talk this morning? I'm curious. Oh, so you're stalking me. Thank you. I appreciate that. How many people have heard it takes one to tango, ah, two days ago? Great. You, you are really are stalking me. So, and how many people have not seen me at all at least in this conference? Okay. Great. Welcome. Uhm, I, I usually introduce myself and explain how I got to be the divorce buster that I am, I am today, but I will spare those of you who have been bowling me around because either that or I'll take volunteers from the audience to do it for me. Uhm, because by now I suspect you probably could. But I will tell you that my name is Michele Weiner-Davis and that I am the director of the Divorce Busting Center in Boulder, Colorado which is a wonderful place to be living and I have an office in Illinois as well. Uhm, in my office I see some couples locally, ah, in a more kind of traditional way, uhm, but more of what I've been up to in the last few years is to do two-day intensives with couples who fly into Boulder and, ah, a little bit about those couples, they are all hanging on by a thread. I would say somewhere between 90 to 95% of them are experiencing infidelity which is oftentimes the primary reason that they're coming to my office. So although I may not have intended, uhm, to become an expert in helping people heal from infidelity by default in terms of the couples that I'm working with, it just seems to have happened, uhm, not only given these intensive couples, uhm, but the fact that I've been really specializing in work with couples since the mid '80s and when my book Divorce Busting came out in the early '90s I receive so much media attention for that that I sort of got type chaos as someone to go to when all else fails. And, uhm, I, day in and day out, work with couples who have pretty severe problems and I told that one of the groups that I spoke to yesterday that I started out the family therapy, uhm, and sometimes doing individual therapy. And nowadays at the end of couples intensive when all they're doing is blaming and counter-blaming, I long for those days where I was dealing with problems of depression or poor self-esteem or body image or something like that. Uhm, but in truth, uhm, I love what I do and in addition to the, ah, doing the two-day intensives, I also have developed a telephone, a divorce busting telephone coaching program, uhm, where the reason this came about was because I would get calls to my office from people asking for referrals of other therapists who did divorce busting work in other parts of the country. And since very often I didn't know anybody, and I never wanted anybody to fall with the cracks because you now know what I psychotic optimist I really am, uhm, I decided to, ah, over the course of the trainings that I do, uhm, spot people who really seem to get this way of working both emotionally and technically and try them to do telephone coaching. And so it started out rather small but it has grown now to be an international program. We speak to people literally all over the world. And one of the differences between, uhm, the work that I do when I'm working with intensive couples for two days and the te-- ah, telephone coaching, ah, that we do is that on the telephone coaching there is only one person who wants to save the marriage. Very much so wants to save the marriage. But the other person is out the door. Not only is the other person seemingly out the door, many times that other person is having an affair. And the reason I bring that up, uhm, is because how you treat people when one person is desperately wanting the marriage to work and the other one is out the door and that's the person having it. That is very different from the program I'm going to share with you today which is a program of how to work with the couples when there has been infidelity and it seems as if they do want their relationship to work. At least that's the direction that they're headed. And I have come up with what I consider to be a step by step approach. And by the way, this morning in my talk when I mentioned that it is really successful therapy is really about you and forget about the techniques, so now I'm going to be contradicting myself and sharing with you techniques that you can use and you can bring yourself to the process. And when I say bring yourself to the process, uhm, I'm curious how many people have attended other workshops in this conference about healing-- helping couples heal from infidelity. Raise your hands. Ah, I'd say most of you have. Uhm, and I think what you'll find is that there tends to be some disagreement about how to actually help couples through this struggle. And I really think that's okay because when you bring yourself to the process I'm pretty convinced that there is no single correct way to work with couples in regards to anything including infidelity. So you have to feel comfortable with what you're doing when you work with them. And I say this because part of the promise I made to myself when I begin-- when I got to the field, and I mentioned this earlier that I would really be clear about continuing over the course of my work with people to focus on what works and what doesn't work and to try to build on the things that were effective and illuminate the rest. And the program for healing from infidelity that you'll hear about today is sort of what I've learned in the trenches with couples. I have distilled down all the experiences that I've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of, uhm, being with these couples with serious problems to what seems to work. Uhm, so again, this is a work in progress. There's part-- there are parts of it that I am totally comfortable with. There are parts of it I'm less than comfortable with. But for the moments, this is what I have noticed that works best for me. So I'm going to encourage you to hear what I have to say today, take what fits for you, leave the rest. And I'm also going to encourage you to do that with, uhm, other presenters and other presentations that you've heard because again when it comes back to what really works in therapy is you and your credibility and believing in what you do. So this is what I believe in. Uhm, years ago when I used to be called and, and even now, uhm, but years ago when I used to be called about my billings, about people who have experienced infidelity and the prognosis for their marriage, in some ways I felt like I was a little bit of a cheerleader and I gave such a positive blah-blah message about what was possible after couples had these surprises in their relationship. And what I would say is that infidelity is not a marital-- marriage deal breaker that people definitely can heal. If they're willing to do the work, they can come out the other side stronger than ever. In fact, the metaphor that I used to talk about was that it's said that when a bone breaks the scar tissue of the bone when it heals is actually stronger in constitution in the place of the break than the constitution of the rest of the bone. So this sounds pretty good, right? Uhm, and it's true. Do I still believe that I do? But the longer I've worked with couples, the more I can tell you that I think healing from infidelity is a very, very difficult thing. In fact-- I'm, I'm having to adjust my little microphone here. I feel like Madonna. Uhm, in fact, I, I wrote a blog once called infidelity isn't for sissies. It takes a long time. Uhm, and it takes a lot of work, it takes a lot of dedication. And can people come out the other side with the stronger relationship? You'd bet they can. But they're, they're in for a job and so are you. What helps is to have tools. Uhm, the, the other thing I wanna mention to you is that there is a lot of discussion in our field these days about the fact that perhaps we need to, uhm, allow the theories that we develop in terms of helping couples heal from infidelity to be influenced a little bit more, uhm, by-- from other cultures that in a way some people believe that Americans are too parochial in their perspective about infidelity. And that perhaps that we should be looking to European cultures, uhm, where supposedly there is more acceptance and not same sort of, uhm, really, uhm, difficult reaction that so many people have when after the discovery of infidelity here in the States. Uhm, what I wanna tell you is that in my practice, uhm, I-- the people who come to me are so devastated after the discovery of an affair that many of the symptoms that they're describing. You know, they can't eat, they can't sleep, they can't think, they can't concentrate, they can't work, they can't function. Very reminiscent to PTSD. And so I tend to think that if we are going to look at other cultures, ah, first of all, we live in the United States, this is our culture. And secondly, we're gonna look at other cultures. Maybe we should broaden our skull to look at cultures beyond European cultures. There are some cultures where infidelity brings upon-- brings about public stoning and death, uhm, a consequence I'd like to consider sometimes. No, just kidding. Don't-- just kidding. Uhm, so in, in any case, uhm, and before I get into the step by step method that I use to helping people, uhm, I know that some of you who were in my first workshop are already really with this but I'm gonna ask you that they are with me. Uhm, I first wanna show you a very serious clip about gender differences. And, uhm, how many people when you work with couples talk about gender differences from time to time? Great. In particular, how many people talk about what seems to be stereotypically the tendency in men when women talk about what they're feeling, uhm, for men to wanna fix things? Raise your hands. I can see a lot of hands. Even in the dark, I can see the hands. So this will be a very important clip for you to get a hold of and show your clients while you can. Isn't that great? So, ah, when I saw that I thought that I'm gonna show that at workshops. Even if it's irrelevant, I'm showing that. So thank you for, uhm, allowing my ADD to work. It's okay. I actually contacted the guy who wrote and start in that and I told him that I was a marriage therapist and I was really impressed not only with the wording but the acting and that I planned on showing on it. And so that I can use all PR that I can get. So, uhm, I, I just really love that. And so one more thing before I get into the, the program itself. I know people are interested in demographics in terms of like who's having affairs. So I thought it started out by asking you guys with the show of hands. Who's having affairs? I hear nervous laughter. Okay. So and I'm also wondering how many people actually printed out the handouts that are uploaded. So in this whole group I see like three or four hands. You're, you're not very compliant. So I do have slides and if anybody want some, some information, just then email me so.

Healing from Infidelity Michele Weiner-Davis www.DivorceBusting.com General Thoughts on Healing • Affairs are destructive for marriages • Universal rules don't work • Healing takes a long time and it's not a straight line • Spending time together helps 

00:13:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So first I'd like to start to talk about some general thoughts that I have about healing from infidelity. Uhm, I already have discussed this point in my opening that I believe that affairs are really destructive for marriages. Uhm, that they, uhm, so-- they rock the very foundation upon which relationships and marriages are built which is trust. And it takes, as I said, a long time to heal from that. And for most people there's an enormous amount of grief in terms of dreams lost. I've had so many people say to me, I know people have affairs but I just never thought my spouse would be one of them. And, uhm, it, it, it takes a lot of courage and stamina and dedication to go through the process that I'm going to describe. 

00:14:00
General Thoughts on Healing • Affairs are destructive for marriages • Universal rules don't work • Healing takes a long time and it's not a straight line • Spending time together helps 

00:14:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, can I have the, ah-- thank you. Uhm, universal rules don't work very well. And what I mean by this, I used to-- when I started out working with couples where there was infidelity, I used to have some universal rules that I thought made a lot of sense. For example, uhm, if I was working with the couple and I knew that there was an affair going on, I would make that person make a commitment that at least for the time that we were working together on the marriage that they would stop seeing the other person. Uhm, this didn't work all that well. Two things happened. They either lied to me about what was going on which I didn't particularly like or they dropped out which I really don't like because I always have this belief that if they stick with me I'm going to help them through this process. So I stopped having that as a universal rule because I really felt that it made the affair partner seem like the forbidden fruit. Uhm, there's another thing and that has to do-- and, and by the way, uhm, I won't work with a couple forever if there's another person involved. But I'll work with them long enough to see whether the other person becomes the affair, the affair partner becomes extraneous because we are rebuilding the relationship. The other universal rule that I have now decided doesn't make any sense is what happens when I find out with just one person in my office that there is an affair going on, there's a confession that there's an affair going on. I'm the one that knows, but the other person doesn't know. I used to have a universal rule that we now must disclose this information to the other spouse. And I know that you've been to other workshops, you've heard other people's ways of approaching this, and here's what I wanna tell you about that. There are some people-- because I used to have that as a mandatory requirement, there are some people who when they share the disclosure with their spouse. That is the turning point in therapy. That is when things truly start to get better. That's when healing begins. Because now all the cards are on the table, there's intimacy, there's honesty, there's openness, and that's when things are going to begin to flourish. There are other people who when they finally share the secret the marriage is over. It's done. And since I can't tell in advance what kind of response is going to occur as a result of the disclosure, I don't want to play God. I don't want to insist that this information be shared because I just can't tell. So if I know the secret, I don't like that. It's an uncomfortable place for me to be. But as I said before, I, I will work with that person and that relationship as long as there continuous to be progress and as long as eventually this affair partner will be out of the scene. And the good news is that I have a videotape that I'm going to show you that really, uhm, highlights exactly how I handle the situation because I know that this is one of the most perplexing situations that those of us deal with these kinds of situations find ourselves in. So I will show you very concrete video about how this works. 

00:17:55
General Thoughts on Healing • Affairs are destructive for marriages • Universal rules don't work • Healing takes a long time and it's not a straight line • Spending time together helps 

00:17:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So I said this, healing takes a long time and it's not a straight line. So here's what I mean, and I know if you've worked with these couples you've noticed this too where the disclosure happens, there's a crisis, they decide they wanna try to work on it. In the very beginning, the person who's had the affair from the purposes of discussion let's just say he had the affair but women have affairs too, increasing numbers as well. Uhm, but let's just say he had the affair so he's willing to do whatever it takes to keep this marriage together. And for a while things seemed to be getting better. And then they go out to dinner and the waitress' name is Janet. And Janet happens to be the name of the woman with whom he had an affair. Not only is the dinner miserable, the next of that evening, the next day, the next week, there's a major relapse. And then they do-- they try to rebuild, they try to get things back on track, and they do, and the next time they go out she smell some perfume and it was perfume that she smelled before and again the same sort of thing happens. Very often this is a point at which you will see these couples coming for therapy because especially the person who's been unfaithful who wants the marriage to work cannot really understand what's going on. There seems to be progress and all, all of a sudden they're back to square one. Then there's progress and there's hope, and then it feels like they're back to square one. They are not back to square one. The road to recovery for infidelity is a zigzag. And as long as the trajectory is in an upward position, then you know that you're moving in the right direction. And I'll be talking a little more about this but people tend to get incredibly hopeless when they have a setback. You have to help them keep the hope even when things have taken two steps backward. 

00:20:05
General Thoughts on Healing • Affairs are destructive for marriages • Universal rules don't work • Healing takes a long time and it's not a straight line • Spending time together helps 

00:20:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Spending time together helps. Okay. So we have maternity leave, we have paternity leave. I think we should have infidelity leave. And the reason I say this is because I've noticed with so many of the clients with whom I'm working, uhm, I'll hear things like, "I'm really okay when we're together, when he's around I'm really feeling better and a little more secure. In the moment we go our separate ways and he goes off to work, I start feeling incredibly anxious again." Raise your hands if you've heard that from people. So practically everybody. So the antidote to that is for you to be insistent upon the fact that they spend as much time together after the discovery is possible. Now some people have more flexibility in terms of the work that they do than others. But if they have flexibility, have him take off time from work. And if they don't have that sort of flexibility, help them find the concrete ways to connect a great deal during the course of everyday. Again, I'll be talking more about that. 

00:21:25
General Thoughts on Healing • Balance between discussing the affair and putting it into the past is necessary • Don't throw in the clinical towel 

00:21:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Balance between discussing the affair and putting it into the past is necessary. This is another place where I see couples come to me often where they're having this debate about who's right and who's wrong. So he's had the affair. He wants to just put it in the past, move on, and not talk about it, and just work on their relationship without discussing what happened. And she feels that you simply cannot fathom the pain that I've been experiencing if you're not willing to talk about it. And this is a debate that they'd been having usually for awhile before they get there and then they look at me as if to say who's right and who's wrong. And one of the things I said in one of my other workshops is that the art of doing good couples therapy in regards to any presenting problem is having both spouses leaving knowing that you're on their side. In this case it's easy because they really both are right. They need to be able to discuss what happened. They will not get through he-- the healing part of infidelity unless they can talk about the affair and what happened. And conversely, as time marches on they need to also be together with problem free time where they're just connecting and not discussing it. You know, one of the-- ah, this is a little aside, but one of the homework assignments that I give couples on a pretty regular basis when they'd been debating about this, they do feel some relief after I tell them that they're both right, but they don't really know what to do with that information. And one of the homework assignments that I've, uhm, given them is I'll say, so in the next week, in between now and the next time we meet, I'd like for you to pick, and I'm, I'm picking this arbitrarily, you can bid it to your client situation, at least twice over the course of the week when you for 30 to 45 minutes you sit down, give private time away from the kids where you're gonna uninterpreted talk where you can talk about what happened, you can-- and he'll left to answer all of her questions, uhm, and do it lovingly and you know that there is let's say and I say, on your schedule when would that be best if you picked two times and someone might say Tuesday and Thursday, I'd say great. And then what happens is that at all other times when you have this random thought that you wanna ask about to the person who's been betrayed you have to remind yourself that now is not the time, I will do it on Tuesday evening, I will do it on Thursday evening. And when I'd given this structure to people who are really struggling with who is right and who is wrong, they both are so thrilled that they attended the session with me because she's feeling like I'm saying it's okay to talk about it. He has to answer her questions. And he's feeling it's time limited. I can do anything for, you know, a short period of time. What's been happening is it's-- this whole affair conversation is taking on a life of its own. It's infiltrated every aspect of our relationship. So, yeah, I can do that. So they both leave feeling like I'm their ally. It's a very practical tool. 

00:25:00
General Thoughts on Healing • Balance between discussing the affair and putting it into the past is necessary • Don't throw in the clinical towel 

00:25:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, we're just back for a second. And the last point there is don't throw in the clinical towel. And what I mean by that, and I know you'll know what I'm talking about, if you work with the couples for a while where there's been infidelity and they keep having those setbacks, they will get discouraged, they will really start to question whether it's worth the work to do this, whether they're mismatched, whether this is a sign that they should really start to consider separation and divorce. They will soon convince you to feel hopeless. If you don't remember constantly about the zigzag, don't throw in the clinical towel with them. There is one question that should be your mantra every time they can't come back with the setback which is, how did you get yourselves back on track? How will you get yourself back on track? What do you need to do today to get things back on track? That's one question. Another question might be, I know you guys had a rough spot in between sessions but I'm really curious, how was this rough spot different from the one that you've had about a month ago? Help them to find-- they might say something like it didn't last this long. We didn't say as many things to one another. I didn't have an anxiety attack. Help them find the differences even within the setbacks because that leads to hopelessness. When people can see movement even within the setbacks, then they know that they're on course. 

00:27:00
Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Express feelings- anger, hurt, rage, fear • Ask for details if it helps 

00:27:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So I, I have outward some tasks for the partner who's been betrayed and some tests for the, uhm, partner who's been unfaithful. And although they're, they're written in a linear fashion because that's the English language and that's how you have to do this sorts of handouts or, ah, keynote presentations, uhm, the truth is there's a progression overtime. So something that shows up at the end of this list is not something that you would do right after the discovery. Uhm, so you don't need to tell someone to this who's been betrayed because chances are they'll be doing this in any case. But they could use your support and encouragement. As I said before, the, the devastation that I have experienced in watching people who have just found out about affairs. And when I say just found out, uhm, I, I have recently had several couples, uhm, where it was just like a week before they schedule the appointments that they found out that their spouse had had multiple affairs. Uhm, awhile back, I had a couple who flew in and the guy was determined to save his marriage. And she wasn't so sure and he said, you know, I-- "We've got these two great kids. I really want our marriage to work, it's the most important thing in my life and the only thing that would make me feel differently about this is if she had an affair." I had two days ahead of me with this couple and she said, "I had an affair." And, and so at that moment you start to wonder how am I going to fill in the rest of these two days because he stood up, he was about to walk out of the room. So sometimes, I, I get people in the very early stages, they are-- they, they look at me like people who have had PTSD. They really, really-- do I know that you've experienced this with your clients as well. Encourage them to talk about their feelings in the session, in between sessions, uhm, because it's really part of the process to be able to express those feelings openly and honestly. 

00:29:25
Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Express feelings- anger, hurt, rage, fear • Ask for details if it helps 

00:29:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ask for details if it helps. So this is some place where you'll get this agreement among people who specialize in working with couples. And I wanna tell you that I feel so strongly about this. I'm really glad I'm up here sharing this information with you. That if someone feels, if someone who's been betrayed feels that they need to know details, you need to encourage that process to happen. I'd been-- I have consulted with other therapists who ask many questions about, "Should I let her ask this?" or "Should I let him ask this?" or "What's going to happen if has these images in his mind?" or-- and, and what I wanna tell you is that if someone feels determined to know information, a lot of the therapists stop their clients from asking questions because the therapist feel uncomfortable about the process. If to leave your values out of the process, what I do when people say I really need to know, we start working on that there in the session and I make sure that they have opportunities to do it at home, but I always ask in my very pragmatic way, goal-oriented way, "Was that helpful for you? When you ask those questions last night, was that helpful for you?" And if they say, "Yes, it was extremely helpful because the pictures that I had in my mind were far worse than the facts that I actually got." That's a person who I would support and encourage to continue to ask questions until her curiosity run dry. Conversely, there are some people who ask questions and I will say, "Was that helpful for you?" And they'll say, "No, I felt terrible. Now I have a name. Now I have a picture in my head. Now I know a position. They were-- now I know that he said that he loved her." So I said, "So it wasn't helpful to you?" And they'll say no. I'll said that, "Okay. I'm really glad you're saying that because we have some things to talk about." I guarantee you that in the course of this you're going to feel tempted to ask questions. And since you know in your heart that it's hurting you, not helping you, the next time you feel the urge to ask the questions, "What will you do to resist the temptation to ask the questions? What will you do instead?" Help them come up with the specific strategy that will get them to not ask the question. I think part of what I'm illustrating here, and part of what I feel so strongly about is human beings are very complex and very different and I don't believe that there is any one way of working with every couple who's experienced infidelity. You have to find out how that person is interpreting what's, what's happened in their life and how they're handling it, and what they need to do that's helpful and what isn't helpful. We need to find out who we're working with. I wanna show you a very short clip of a woman who asked. She had just found out I, I think it was like 10 days prior to working with me that her husband had not one but multiple affairs. And w hat really, uhm, ratcheted up her emotions about that is they hadn't had sex for 15 years. So she found Viagra and knew that he wasn't using it with her and, uhm, so it was, it was incredibly stressful. But she-- when she told me she asked a lot of questions, I asked her, "Was it helpful?" and here's what she said. You know what she said? She said, "When I first found that he was doing this, I made up in my head that he was doing it with little boys." So the fact that she found out whatever she found out which was very upsetting to her, but a lot better than that fantasy that she had in her head. So the upshot of this is don't you decide for people what's best for them cuz I see a lot of that. I see a lot of people and therapists doing that, deciding what's best for people. Have them tell you what works for them and what doesn't work for them. 

00:34:10
Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Ask for reassurances without accusing • Identify what might help and ask for it • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Learn how to thought stop 

00:34:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ask for reassurances without accusing. Okay. So here's what often happens. Uhm, so he's on an affair, she's at home making dinner. He's supposed to be there at six o'clock at night. And six o'clock comes rolling around, he's not there. 6:05 he's not there. She's starting to get a little nervous. 6:10, she's starting to hyperventilate. She starts calling him on the cellphone, he doesn't answer his cellphone. By 6:15, she nuts. I mean, she's really crazy. And 6:20, he walks through the door. And when he walks through the door, she bombards him, "Where were you? I knew you were with her. What's going on here? You're a liar. I know you were with her. You didn't answer your cellphone." Now he had the cellphone on silent and he didn't know it. What do you think this woman is needing from this man? She's wanting reassurance. The way in which she's approaching him is the least likely way for her to get what she needs. So when I hear stories like this or when I witness it in the therapy room, I stop, yeah. And I'll say, "What is it that you're hoping will happen?" And I'll hear something like, "I was really scared. I didn't know where he was. I really wanted to hear where he was." I said, "So you would like a reassurance." "Yes, that's right." Well the way in which you're doing this is not likely to get you what you need and what you deserve. You deserve reassurance. So let's do a replay on this. And I actually coach people how to do it differently. How to talk differently so they get what they need, they deserve what they need. And I might say to her-- no, actually, I might say to him, "How would it had been different for you? Had she said to you when you walk through the door that when you didn't answer your cellphone and you're 20 minutes late I got really scared and start to wonder where you were and I'm worried that you're with her and it really scared me?" He said, "That would be a 100% different. I would really wanna be kind and empathetic and caring. But the way she bombarded with her 21 questions, the la-- that's the last thing that I need." So we talk about the way to do it so that people get what they really, really deserve.

MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Identify what might help and ask for it. So very often I'll just say to, to people, uhm, think about this past week. Can you think about a time that you felt just a little bit better. I'm not saying great necessarily, but just a little bit better. And sometimes they'll say yes, there was a time or a short period of time-- hello, hello, turning off my mic would be something that my husband would like to do from time to time I guess. Now we know how to do it. Oh, boy, Murphy's law. Okay, uhm, let's see if I can go back to where I was. Uhm, who's got a good memory? You-- ah, identify what might helps. Thank you very much. Uhm, so can you think about a time in this past week where you felt just a little bit better? Yes, there was a, a short period of time where I wasn't ruminating about it. What was different about that time? What were you doing differently? What was he doing differently? What was going on differently in your life? And if he had something to do with it, she gets to asking for that help. And she gets to see that there are things that she can do even for short periods of time that will make it better.

00:38:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And I have, got that, identify areas of the marriage needing improvement. So this is actually, ah, although you may do this early on and you may not, this is sometimes a tricky situation. I have worked with a lot of betrayed spouses who can't wait to talk about what needs to change in the marriage in order for the marriage to be stronger. And by the way, one of the things that we've learned from the late Shirley Glass who's a dear friend of mine, and I recommend her book, uhm, Not Just Friends, uhm, was that therapist have this mythical thinking and I certainly was one of them, that every time someone has an affair it's an indication that there's something wrong with the marriage. There are some people who have affairs who actually feel good about their marriages, they just decide to have affairs in any case. Uhm, but whether there is the marriages on pretty stable grounds or not, when there's been infidelity and there's hurt to go along with it, they are now in crisis. So their marriage now needs improvement. And once they're sitting in my office, I use it as an opportunity to really strengthen the relationship. Now sometimes with betrayed spouses they are really eager to take a look at what needs to change in their spouse, in themselves, in the relationship for it to be stronger, and to hopefully to the best of their ability affair proved the marriage. But there are other people when I've raised the issue about what needs to change they felt like I was blaming the victim. Do you know what I mean by that blaming the victim? Asking what it-- what needs to change, what do you need to do differently, what needs to change in this relationship, they were starting to feel like I didn't do anything wrong so why are you asking me what do I need to change in order for this relationship to be healthy. So when someone-- again, you have to keep your eyes open for who's in your office and not assume an approach works the same way with everybody. When people are willing to begin to discuss the differences that they need to make, the changes that they need to make in order to really improve their relationship, go for it. But if someone holds up a red stop sign, then that means you back for a while. That means you back off. 

00:40:55
Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Ask for reassurances without accusing • Identify what might help and ask for it • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Learn how to thought stop 

00:41:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Now this is way down the road. It doesn't happen in the beginning. But when I-- the, the bulleted item is learn how to thought stop. And what I mean by that is once things are really on track and somebody is interested in being intimate again not just physically but in all ways, occasionally they'll come and say, "I'm feeling better about things. I'm really appreciating, you know, the efforts that he's putting into the relationship and I know he's doing everything that he can. But every time I try to feel close or get close physically, I start having really bad thoughts or I start getting these images." And there are a lot of different ways that you can deal with it. But one of the ways that I've used with people, uhm, it's a cognitive approach which I'm sure many of you are familiar with is called thoughts stopping. And my particular version of this is I do this exercise with people where I ask them to-- uhm, the moment that-- well first of all, they start it out by envisioning a place or a person or a thing that helps them to feel serene and calm and connected to themselves. And I have them really getting to that image and that feeling that goes along with it. And then I ask them to the next time they have a thought that is interfering with what they're hoping will happen with their spouse to imagine a big red stop sign. And then as soon as they have the stop sign to go back to the image that we've practiced in terms of their safe place, and does this work-- ah, is this an easy thing to do? No, it's not an easy thing to do particularly when people have been so distraught. But I assure people that with practice and stick-to-itiveness that they can shift their thinking as long as they have there, uhm, something to shift their thinking to which is that safe space. Uhm, a lot of people have benefited from EMDR also if the images have been, uhm, really interfering with their goals in life.

Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Learn ways to get back on track • Forgive or accept • Become sexual again 

00:43:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I wanna make sure. Is this the-- okay. Uhm, learn ways to get back on track. Again as I've said earlier, there will be many, many setbacks along the way and it's im-- important that you continue to ask the question, how did you get yourselves back on track? What did you do? What did he do? Or how do you need to get yourself back on track? What will you need to do? Of course, in this process, eventually people will need to forgive or to-- I-- ah, uhm, Janis Abraham Spring wrote a book that I think was pro-- very helpful in terms of helping people know there's no alternative to forgiving someone and that's really just accepting the situation, accepting that it's happened, deciding to move forward in their life, not necessarily forgiving someone, and I find that to be a useful distinction. But in terms of forgiveness, I have a little sermonette that I give people in regards to forgiveness that I will share with you. Uhm, and feel free to use any of it that resonates with you and that you think might be useful to your clients. So often when people are having a really difficult time letting go I tell them, you know, this really isn't about forgiving your spouse as much as forgiveness is a gift that you give yourself. It truly is a gift that you give yourself. When you are holding a grudge or when you have lack of forgiveness in your heart, when you wake up in the morning, your entire world is just black and white, it's just not technicolor anymore. You feel stressed, you feel edgy. There's sort of a low-grade depression that's there. And when you're holding that in and you have such a, a grudge in your heart that it takes its toll on you mentally, physically, spiritually. It also takes a toll on your immune system. And if you have children, and you have lack of forgiveness and you are not interacting in a loving way because you're holding on to this grudge, they're watching you. They learn lessons of love by watching you. Is this what you want your children to learn about what marriage is about? To see the cold war between the two of you? And when I say that, sometimes people to me, "But Michele, I cant forgive because I can't forget." And I say forgiveness is not to be confused with forgetting. You don't forget and you shouldn't forget. We have to learn from our experiences. You're not going to forget this. What will happen overtime is you'll think about it less and less often. The periods between thinking about it will become more and more extended. And when you think about it, it won't have quite the sting that it does right now. But you will not forget this. And then people say, "But I feel like forgiving is to condone the behavior." I say forgiveness is not to be confused with condoning behavior. You don't condone the behavior. You don't feel that it was okay or all right according to your values. You're just saying to yourself that you are wanting to wipe the slate clean. That truly everybody makes mistakes. You make mistakes, I make mistakes, that you just don't wanna live with the shackles of lack of forgiveness. Just remember, this is something that you're doing for yourself. And very often that's enough to help people a little over the edge when they feel like their stuff there. 

00:47:20
Tasks for the Betrayed Spouse • Learn ways to get back on track • Forgive or accept • Become sexual again 

00:47:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Become sexual again. Eventually, ah, you know, especially-- you know, some couples after there has been infidelity, I don't know if you've experiences in your practice but have really had sex, uhm, after the disclosure, uhm, that does that happen. But I've also worked with a lot of people where they stopped touching and they stopped touching for a pretty long time. And if the marriage is going to heal, uhm, it truly has to be sexual again. And part of that entails your leading them down a path of talking about their sexual relationship. It is mind-boggling to me how many couples who have been married for decades never ever talk about sex with each other and they certainly don't do it in a specific way. It is mind-boggling. Or they talked about it in their early 20's and now they're in their mid 40s or early 50's and they incorrectly assume that whatever they learned in their 20's still applies. It's outdated, outdated data. They have to get an upgrade of information. It doesn't apply. You know that as you get older our bodies change, what we need and what we want changes. And honestly, if you're working with couples, you have to feel comfortable talking specifically about sex. And if you don't, then you need to take classes on sex therapy so that you can help to lead that discussion. So I'm going to show you a short clip of that same couple you just saw, uhm, where it's, you know, it's toward the end of the second day but it's still in that first visit that I have with them. They did come back for another two days, but this is still in that first visit. And she begins-- we, we begin to explore the possibility of not necessarily having intercourse, but at least being physically close again. 

00:49:30
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • End the affair • Show remorse • Show empathy • Share details • Expect ups and downs 

00:49:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Here are some tests for the unfaithful spouse. Hopefully this person will have ended the affair before they get to you. But ultimately hopefully they will end the affair, period, because truly that's the, the best outcome for the marriage, it's for the affair to end. The be-- the unfaithful person also has to show remorse and I will lump into that empathy. But remorse-- by the way, we all have that different definitions of what remorse looks like. And very often these couples will be stuck because he'll say I have been remorseful, I've been doing this and I've been doing that and I've doing been doing this, but he's missing the mark because he doesn't know her definition of remorse. So you have to ask her when he is remorseful what sorts of things will you see him doing and saying that will make you know that he really feels sorry about what happened. And for every person it's different. For some people, it's a willingness to talk about what happened. For others, it's a willingness to say I'm sorry to the in-laws. For other people it's, it's saying I'm sorry not once. And by the way, I always tell this to people, ah, if you think you have said you're sorry and you're in that something that hits the mark for your partner, you can't just say it once, you have to say it again and again and again until it's not necessary anymore. So find out from the betrayed spouse what will your partner be doing when you feel that he's being remorseful. Similarly, I want my spouse to be empathetic to really understand what I'm going through. Well I say two things about that. Your spouse will never, unless they'd been in that same position, really understand exactly what you're feeling because you're different people. He can't really, really understand what you're feeling inside, but he could do a jo-- good job of trying. So what will he need to do in order for you to feel like he's truly trying to understand how you feel, that he's really with you on this, that you're on the same page? 

00:52:10
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • End the affair • Show remorse • Show empathy • Share details • Expect ups and downs 

00:52:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Be willing to share the details. Uh-huh, important point here. What I have found with many people who have betrayed their spouses, in the beginning they're willing to share the details if that's what's desired. But when they're continuous to be these relapses and these setbacks, they start to conclude that sharing the details isn't working because if it were working we wouldn't be back to square one. So I'm not gonna talk about this anymore. That's not okay. I mean, that really isn't okay. And I'm encouraging you to be directive with these clients. These clients feel lost. And you know, background is solution focused therapy and in solution focused-- how many people are familiar with solution focused model? Like, most of you are. And you that in solution focused model you're not supposed to bring stuff up that clients don't brought up and you're not supposed to offer solutions, you're supposed to access solutions and resources within. And I say that's all great to do that. But sometimes you have to be directive. And when it comes to this sort of crisis that this people are going through, they are looking for direction. Be strong, be clear. And say it's not okay not to share details if she needs that from you. There's another reason that people who betrayed their partners often don't like to share details. They feel shame. I've had so many people say to me, "I don't want to talk about it because I feel so badly about what happens." I, I feel so much shame. And you know what I say to that person? The fact that you feel shame tells me that essentially you're a really good person and that this behavior wasn't consistent with how you think about yourself and that really tells me a lot about who you are as a person. I appreciate that about you. I also suspect that you're not wanting to hurt her feelings anymore because that's shaming you or you're feeling shamed by that as well and I appreciate that about you. But I just wanna tell you something. You just don't get to protect yourself from feeling shame right now. Right now if you want this marriage to work, what you need to do is to help her through this pain. That will help alleviate your shame when you are walking this path with her in helping her heal from this pain. You don't get to focus on your shame. So when you start to feel ashamed, what is that little inner voice start to say to you? Cuz you want them to be aware of what happens, sort of how, how-- where their mind is going, what that little inner voice is-- where it's taking them cuz you don't want them to go there, you want them to be more cognizant of the triggers. And the next time you hear yourself say, "I don't wanna talk about this because I feel ashamed," that's the tape that's playing in your head. You say, "I can't do this right now, I have to focus on what she's feeling." So it's really important to help a person who feels ashamed to feel better about themselves but to also recognize that they're going to feel even better if they help their partner as oppose to just go inward, uhm, and curl up into ball and not be helpful. 

00:56:05
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • End the affair • Show remorse • Show empathy • Share details • Expect ups and downs 

00:56:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, expect ups and downs. I work with so many people and not, not just men but so many people who get impatient with the erratic progress. And they, they start getting angry and they start-- they stop doing what they need to do to help their partners. And I will pull them aside. Sometimes in this, in this session alone, I'll say this will be one of the hardest things you've ever done. I know you tell me that you wanna save your marriage. If you wanna save your marriage I am really sorry but you are going to have to be patient. It's just the way it is. And a lot of times these are people who have type A personalities and they're really used to-- when they make up their mind that some things are gonna happen, they have a goal, they go after it and it happens. Well that's too bad. It's not gonna work this way at this time. This will be a learning experience for you. And instead of getting angry at your, at your spouse, if you wanna talk to me about it or talk to a friend about it, what can you do to deal with your anger or your impatience around how long this process is taking. What can you do that's productive so that it doesn't have to end up in something that's hurtful in your relationship? 

00:57:30
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Be patient • Be willing to do what it takes to reassure your partner • Examine personal reasons the affair occurred • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Identify possible triggers 

00:57:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Be patient, said that one. Be willing to do what it takes to reassure your partner. Now this is-- uhm, I feel really strongly about this one as well. So I feel that once a person has decided to have an affair, even if there were issues in the relationship that had something to do with the decision to have this affair, the owners of the responsibility, the largest share of the responsibility for getting things back on track outwardly lies directly on the shoulders of the person who made the decision to stray. And the reason I say that is because of this directive which is you have to do what you-- whatever is necessary to help your spouse through this. And what that is, is that so often particularly in the early stages of this, the betrayed spouse wants reassurances in terms of the partner's whereabouts, where are you going, what are you doing, who are you with. So that might mean, uhm, again, spending more time together, frequent calls throughout the day to touch base. Sometimes spouses said, ah, ah, "I don't care about him calling me on his cellphone because who knows where he is when he calls on his cellphone. I want it to be from the landline. I don't even know if there are landlines anymore. But I, I, I want some proof about where he is. I want him to tell me what his schedule, what's going to be. I want him to call me if he's going to be late. I want him to answer my texts in a short period of time to find as however the person defines it. I wanna see his emails. I wanna see his phone records. I want his Facebook password." Now this sounds like a rather extreme sort of way to go in life and very often the person who's been unfaithful will buck and say, "You know, I don't mind doing some of this but I'm starting to feel like I'm imprisoned or like she's my mother." And you know what I say? This is no way to live your life. It's not good for you, I can hear you say that, and actually I don't think it's all that great for her in the long run. But I'm not suggesting that you make this a way of life. What I'm telling you is that you are going through a crisis situation, this is a transitional period. And sometimes when you're going through a transitional period in a crisis situation you have to take measures that you wouldn't have to take otherwise and that's what you need to do now. So I help them come up with the plan. Some people don't need any of this, by the way. I've, I've worked with a couple I think it was just a couple weeks ago where the woman didn't even want him to call during the day because she didn't wanna live her life like that. You have to find out from the people sitting in the room what they need and it is okay to ask for that and you need to urge the unfaithful spouse to comply with the caveat that it's not gonna last forever. 

01:00:55
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Be patient • Be willing to do what it takes to reassure your partner • Examine personal reasons the affair occurred • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Identify possible triggers 

01:00:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Examine personal reasons that the affair occurred. Look, there are lots of reasons that people choose to have affairs. And by the way, one my least favorite statements is when I hear people say, "I didn't mean to have an affair, it just happened." I don't believe affairs just happened. Uhm, I really do believe that on a day by day basis we make decisions. And it's sometimes a slippery slope. You can-- by the way, did you know-- I think it's something like 85% of affairs take place in the workplace? Did you know that? And, uhm, Shirley Glass, uhm, shared that information in her book and she spoke at a national conference and shared that information. And after she gave out that information I remember there was, uhm, a baptist, uhm, pastor who came up with a big bellowing voice to do a keynote afterwards and he said, "Before I do my keynote I just want you to know I called my wife, I said to her, "Honey, I'm not going to work tomorrow, it's dangerous out there." Uhm, so let's see what was I talking about. Reasons for affair. Thank you. Go to the head of the class. Uhm, you are. So, so I ask people, uhm, how did you give yourself permission to take that next step? When you are thinking about this, what did you tell yourself to make it okay? And hopefully we'll come up with their reason for the affair having occurred. Uhm, ah, perhaps you've experienced this. Well sometimes people have no clue, they really have no clue as to why they did what they did, they just did it. And I help them to be a little bit more analytical about it. And sometimes it's for their benefit. But more often than not, it's for the benefit of the betrayed spouse because so many betrayed spouses have told me that unless I really understand what's underneath his decision to stray I won't feel safe in this relationship so I really have to have a handle on that. So that process can certainly take sometime and you can do it with the other spouse present or sometimes you might wanna do, uhm, a few individual sessions with the person who might be struggling to identify the, the reason that he made that decision. 

01:03:45
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Be patient • Be willing to do what it takes to reassure your partner • Examine personal reasons the affair occurred • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Identify possible triggers 

01:03:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Identify areas of the marriage needing improvement. Again, some people are chomping at the bit to talk about what is missing in the marriage and what the emotional or physical void has been in order to heal that part of the marriage, in order to explain why the affair occurred. But believe it or not, there are some people who feel so much shame about what they've done even if there has been something pretty dramatic missing in the relationship. They are hesitant to begin to identify things they like to work on because they feel guilty. And if that's the case, you really have to encourage them and tell them that it, it is okay, this is an opportunity, we're all together, this is an opportunity for us to make your marriage stronger than before. 

01:04:40
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Be patient • Be willing to do what it takes to reassure your partner • Examine personal reasons the affair occurred • Identify areas of marriage needing improvement • Identify possible triggers 

01:04:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Identify possible triggers. Uhm, I do this with all the people that I work with and especially I, I, I work with-- in terms of infidelity, I work with the gamut. On one end of the spectrum there are people who have had one night affairs, uhm, late night at work, too much to drink, out with the coworker, bad decision, never happened before and never happened again. And then on the other end of the spectrum I've worked with people who have, uhm, either what could be classified as sexual addiction or chronic sexual, uhm, infidelity. And one of the things I have found very helpful, uhm, in working with all sorts of folks is to help them to plan how to remain, uhm, faithful as time goes on and by-- and so, in the same way that you might help an alcoholic to identify what might trigger him or her to drink the contextual cues that might lead them down a slippery slope. I do that with the folks, uhm, where there's been infidelity to ask the unfaithful partner, uhm, "What do you think might come up in the next week or two that would a challenge or could be a challenge to you sticking to this great progress that you guys are making in staying the course? Uhm, what's been a challenge to you in the past in terms of remaining monogamous in your marriage?" It helped that person to be specific as possible but they don't stop there. I also turn to the, uhm, betrayed spouse and I'll say, "I know my guess is that there have been behaviors that have occurred in the past that have made you feel somewhat uncomfortable or situations that have made you feel somewhat uncomfortable. Let's talk about them, ones that are particularly might arise again so that you guys have a game plan as to how you will handle it differently instead." Uhm, and thirdly, I will add from my past experience of working with people what I know about triggers and how they can handle them. Uhm, that couple that you just saw, he, uhm, he's an artist. And one of the things that happens regularly in their lives is that every time he has an art event, he, he get surrounded by women who are incredibly interested in his art. And that although he was rather quiet there, he's a pretty charming kind of guy, and he started to recognize all the little steps that are probably leading him down the, the slippery slope. And he said to me, you know, I was thinking about this when I asked about triggers, I like to organize things. And I thought the best way to organize this would be if I thought about my behaviors in terms of red light, yellow light, and green light. The green light are behaviors that are okay. Like, hugging a female friend, that's a mutual friend of both of us, not too long, but that would be okay as long as that's okay with her. And then he went through each of the categories. The, the ones that were doubtful or questionable, the ones that were definitely off-limits. And we did this for quite a long time. The, the one thing I talk to him about is something that I've learned in dealing with people with sexual addiction is this, uhm, thing called second glances, ah, or second looks. So one of the things I shared with him, I said, you know, uhm, people are attracted to the other people. I mean, human beings find other human beings attractive. It's impossible not to look. I mean, it's just part of who we are. That's okay. I mean, it's really okay. It's not okay. When this is an issue in your life what's not okay is to take a second look. It's not okay to turn your head again. And as I said that, she went like pointing over to him, "Yeah, you got him, that's what he does all the time. He's a gawker." And so we talked a little bit about and what they would do the next time if he found himself twisting his body around in contortions to see a woman walking passed him. Uhm, he became more conscious of it, more aware of it, more willing to stop. So identifying triggers I think is a really important thing. 

01:09:20
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Commit to the marriage in a new way • Learn ways to get back on track • Forgive oneself 

01:09:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Helping couples to commit to their marriage in a new way to really get specific with what's okay, what's considered to be, uhm, monogamous or faithful or can it be on Facebook, uhm, you, you know, to really come up with the game plan and an agreement, something they'd never talked about, there are new definition of monogamy. To really redefine their relationship together in this new light is concretely as possible. Let's talk about how you want your marriage to be in terms of safety issues. Is Facebook okay? The private email account is okay? You tell me what's okay and what isn't okay, they'll help you with that. 

01:10:15
Tasks for the Unfaithful Spouse • Commit to the marriage in a new way • Learn ways to get back on track • Forgive oneself 

01:10:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Again, the unfaithful spouse also needs to learn ways to get back on track. And then finally on this list, uhm, we always think about the betrayed spouse needing to forgive the unfaithful spouse. But so often, I've actually seen divorces happen because the unfaithful spouse has such a hard time forgiving him or herself that they can't face the other person and they have to get out of the relationship. Even if they stay in the relationship, they often have such self-contempt about what's happened, that it's really difficult. And you can't be intimate with someone else when you're busy feeling bad about yourself. So I'll show a very short clip about what this man that you've been seeing said about him needing to forgive himself. 

01:11:15
When the affair ends • Lingering feelings of loss, lust and love are normal for unfaithful spouse. Allow time to grieve • Betrayed spouse shouldn't mind read 

01:11:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So when the affair ends, uhm, what-- sometimes what I like to do when I know that the affair has ended or that they're going-- that someone is about to end the affair, I like to get and meet with that person alone because I like to predict to that person that in, in the week-- especially if they'd had a long meaningful affair that in the next weeks or months or however long you might notice that you have feelings of loss, grief. You know, you, you had a meaningful relationship with this person. That just doesn't go away overnight. And when you begin to experience some of those feelings of loss, some people think that they're making a mistake by ending the affair because they love this person so much and that is incorrect thinking. It's normal and natural and healthy for you to grieve over this relationship. It does not mean that you're making a mistake by ending the relationship. So I wanna predict it before it happens otherwise it happens and people draw the wrong conclusion about. Does that make sense? 

01:12:40
When the affair ends • Lingering feelings of loss, lust and love are normal for unfaithful spouse. Allow time to grieve • Betrayed spouse shouldn't mind read 

01:12:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, and I also help them think of ways to grieve through this process, it's a loss. And in regards to the betrayed spouse, I, I-- the, the betrayed spouse shouldn't mind read as what it says. So here's what happens. The affair has ended. They both know the affair has ended. They're home at night. He's staring out the window and she's says or thinks either way, "I know what you're thinking about. You're thinking about her." And you could imagine how that makes for a really great evening. And that happens consistently. You seem really angry. "Are you thinking about her?" So when I suspect that that's going on or what-- if I hear it concretely that it's going on, I will ask the question-- I often ask the questions that are designed to introduce doubt into an unhelpful certainty, that's an unhelpful certainty. Now say when he looks out the window and sort of stares off into space or when he's been quiet for awhile and you think that he's thinking about her, how can you tell the difference between times where he might be thinking about her or times when he might be thinking about football or work or having digestion or whatever it might be, how can you tell the difference between those times? And ultimately, it almost doesn't a-- matter what she answers. The question is the intervention. I want to introduce doubt. She will not be able to forget that question. And the next time she sees him quiet or staring off into space, she-- my voice will go with her, she'll have to remember, "Is he thinking about her or maybe he just is thinking about work or maybe he's just not thinking, he's meditating." And that's really what you wanna do. It's not okay to mind read. So now I wanna turn to a video that illustrates, one of my favorite videos actually that illustrates, uhm, that very difficult clinical dilemma that you get yourself into when you see, when you split the spouses up and you see one person alone and you find out about an affair. I was working with a couple and, uhm, she was identifying what he-- what her husband could do to make things better in the marriage cuz she wasn't sure if she want to stay, and he was doing all those things. And what she said which is always a euphemism for me that someone's having an affair, what she said was, "Yes, he's doing all the right things but it doesn't seem to make a difference." When I hear that, I always wonder if there's an affair when someone's doing all the right things and it doesn't seem to make a difference at all. So one of the things that I do in the presence of the other spouse if I have them both there is I'll say, I'll ask the partner I'm wondering about, I'll say, "You know, you seem so unhappy in this marriage. What's prevented you from going outside your marriage and having an affair?" Sometimes people say, "Nothing has prevented me. I have done that." And sometimes people come up with an explanation for why they would never do that, that's not who they are, and 90% of the time it's-- well, I don't know, about 90%-- mu-- much of the time that's not true. Uhm, but in any case-- then I, then I wanted to see her alone and I suggested that, you know, we split the session or that, that she come back alone. And the audio on this tape is really bad so, but there are, uhm, subtitles so you'll be able to read along with it so the sound does not have to be very loud. Did that woman look physically different to you? She looks so different to me. When I saw her, I just couldn't believe it. I mean, she really, really look different. And keep in mind this was two weeks later when she decided not to see her friend, she decided to focus on herself instead. And what I want to ask you is what are your thought? And, and I guess if you have a response for this, I don't know if there are mics set up or-- I can't really tell, or whether I'll just repeat-- is that a mic? Okay. Uhm, no, there's-- it looks like a mic holder. 

01:17:15
UNKNOWN No, it's a microphone. 

01:17:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, okay, okay. Oh, there it is. Okay. It's a limp mic. 

01:17:25
[sil.] 

01:17:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Thanks. It's late in the afternoon, sorry. Uhm, I would love to hear from you, your thoughts, about why this woman was willing in such a short period of time to shift in her perspective about things and what she was going to do. What is it that you saw me do that might have contributed to that outcome? If you have a thought about it, and you wanna come to the mic, yes. 

01:18:00
UNKNOWN You let her out of the box of it's either this or it's that. 

01:18:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS That's right. 

01:18:05
UNKNOWN You opened up the choices and she could start to sense what she actually thought or what was possible and that it, it wasn't a black and white situation anymore. 

01:18:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Thank you. I, I didn't throw my agenda down her throat. I honored where she was at. I relied on that all the social work added, just start where your client is at. Because otherwise it doesn't work. They'll drop out, they'll go to someone else. I want them to stay with me cuz I wanna help on. So I think that's one thing. What else did you see me do that might have contributed to her willingness to shift? 

01:18:45
UNKNOWN You've told her she was a good person. You validated her. 

01:18:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, yes. Thank you. To me, you know, I think that's a really good response because I agree with you. I like people who I agree with, all right. So, uhm, I, I really think that in the midst of that whole model, that mess, I told her that she was a person of integrity. When she said how badly she felt that she was doing to her husband the same thing, that her husband had done to her, her first husband had done to her, I said, "That must be hard for you." I told her she was a person of integrity, this must really be a struggle. Please remember what you focus on expands. What you focus on expands. If you focus on the responsible caring, empathetic, loving, passionate side people, that's the part that shows up. And I really believe that it's sort of like she, she wanted to be consistent with who she felt in her soul she really was. And not because I had a mandatory requirement based on my theoretical orientation. Because that's what she wanted to be. And my hope for you is that if you have qualms about knowing that someone is having an affair, and by the way, when I split people up or when I see people separately, they-- both partners know that what we talk about in that session is confidential. They know that in advance. I might remind them when we're talking, but they know that in advance and they agreed to that. And it is not comfortable knowing that. But, but in my world, if in a matter of just a couple of weeks I can see that sort of shift, it doesn't always work that way, but it does work that way a lot, then I'm willing to hold that secret divorce in a period of time. And, and then they came in together and they worked on their relationship and their marriage be-- became much, much better and much, much stronger. And she never told him, in case you're curious about it, he never found out as far as I know. So anybody have questions about this video, so come to the mic if you do please. 

01:21:25
UNKNOWN That, that, that was a really good result. But when you said first that how long would-- what, what if she didn't give up the affair, how long would you keep it and how would you stop if, if you-- if she didn't stop? 

01:21:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. That's a great question. So sometimes people don't stop and, and just like I said to you earlier I have no universal rules about things, as long as I feel like we're making progress that the relation-- that the person is willing to work on the marriage, and that it looks like that other relationship is getting weaker, the bond is getting weaker, I'll work on it until I feel-- unless I feel uncomfortable because nothing is changing. I don't continue to work with people when nothing is changing. I think that's unethical. I really do. So how I will bail out and how I've done it before is I'll just say to them that I have a role of when we're working together and things don't seem to be making a whole lot of progress that we take a break. It just doesn't seem to be helpful and I'm not feeling great about it, I suspect you're not feeling great about it. Uhm, if at some point in the future you decide to come back, I'm happy to give it another try, but for now I'm going to suggest that we take a break and that's how we stop. Yes. 

01:22:45
UNKNOWN I have two questions for you. One... 

01:22:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well start, start with one. 

01:22:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:22:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:22:50
UNKNOWN Do you ever bring up the subject of STDs during the treatment? 

01:22:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yes, I do. I-- we talk about it. If the other spouse doesn't know, to the best of my ability we talk about safe sex and I realized that there's no perfect method other than abstinence. I recognize that. Uhm, but we do have a, ah, lengthy serious conversation and I'd been incredibly confrontational with people who don't take that seriously, and I've also refused to see people who don't take it seriously. 

01:23:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. And what if the one who has had the affair says that, that he or she doesn't feel bad about it? And I'm quoting because they needed it for their personal growth. 

01:23:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, I think the only solution there is public stoning. Uhm, uhm, well that would also be a person who I would suspect isn't as committed to some of the people I'm talking to you about who really want their marriage to work. Uhm, I, I-- it's not, it's not okay, it's not okay. There are many things that a person can do for personal growth that don't entail having an affair that is hurtful to the other person. And so I try to help that person find other ways to evolve as an individual that don't-- that aren't quite so hurtful. 

01:24:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, could you comment about how do you deal with, ah, the judgment from maybe relatives or close friends that know that, that one of the spouses had an affair - 

01:24:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah. 

01:24:35
UNKNOWN - and the other one is trying to deal with it and they say, "You know, you shouldn't do this"? 

01:24:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yes. Thank you. That is such an important question. So, uhm, I'll, I'll think about this particular couple that I was working with. And, uhm, what happened was he started to have an affair and his wife suspected it. Uhm, and when she suspected it she went to her sister and brother-in-law who were computer geeks and were capable of you know, sort of breaking into all this personal stuff and to track him and-- so she got her family involved and she comes from a very, very close-knit Irish Catholic family and they were really tight. And when he finally got caught, uhm, she decided she was going to take the two little girls that they had and live and go to be with her family. But when they came to me, she changed her mind and he was so remorseful. He felt so bad about it. He do not wanna lose her. He do not wanna lose the kids. And I did some great work with the two of them as a couple, uhm, that made me feeling re-- really optimistic about the possible ways for their marriage. One thing I always do is ask them, "Who else have you told about what's going on?" You have to find out what's going on the system, not just between the two of them, because they're often forces either for the marriage or as you're pointing out I believe so against the marriage. In her case, she said that she recognize that she would have, uhm, several people in her family who would not talk to her if she decided to work on the marriage. So we spent a great deal of time brainstorming how she could deal with them, how she could handle them, what she would say and what she would do and how she would, uhm, bolster herself because she, she was taking a hit from her family. Uhm, I, I actually, ah, I actually wrote a blog called Don't Ask, Don't Tell Your Family. Uhm, and the reason for that is because so often when something like this happens people rely on family members-- close family members as a means of support as they're going through the crisis period and their family members turn against the other spouse understandably so because they're protective. And then all of a sudden people wanna work on the marriage except the, ah, the family is really more than standoffish. So one thing I would say is being very mindful only, turn to people who are really, uhm, supportive of your marriage, who would understand. Don't talk to people who would not understand, that's the first thing. The second thing is to, to help them to come up with the plan very specifically the things that they can say and do to family members. For example, one thing I-- it's sort of a standard thing with me is I, I told her to tell them that she really loves, that she appreciates their caring and that she knows that they're being protective about her feelings, and that she cherishes them for that, but right now she's really still focusing on trying to save her marriage and keep her family together, and that she hopes that they will understand, and she knows that that would be very difficult for them. It's a kind of let the dust cell for awhile. But you're absolutely right that something that you have to ask about, who else knows about this situation, help them come up with the game plan. Thank you. 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:28:10
UNKNOWN I have a two-part question. Uhm... 

01:28:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Does anybody have a one-part question? Just kidding. 

01:28:15
UNKNOWN One is, uhm, how do you-- I mean, is it good or bad if the couple decides to not live together? I'm over here. 

01:28:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh! 

01:28:25
UNKNOWN There's three mics. Is it, is it good or bad if the couple decides to not live together? Like, uhm, I'm working with a couple right now where in the two sessions and she's told him she doesn't feel he's being honest upfront so she want to live apart. I mean, is that-- does that interfere... 

01:28:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah, they're, they're married couples? They have kids? Or... 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Married couples with kids. 

01:28:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yeah. 

01:28:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, and he was-- he actually spent six months looking to have an affair. So we know in his websites - 

01:28:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-huh. 

01:28:50
UNKNOWN - to find someone and multiple failed attempts, finally succeeded, she found out, and she do-- she feels there's more to it. And as the part of the question is, do you find that there's more success when it was just at sex or also when it was, uhm... 

01:29:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Well, all right. Well let's do one thing at a time. So I wanna talk about-- I, I missed something in my bulleted list. Uhm, but in, in terms of separation, I do have a preference, I have a bias. I prefer people not separate, uhm, because I think the likelihood of divorce is greater if people ultimately separate. Because if there is an immediate sense of relief which gets interpreted as this is better for me. Uhm, also there's another reason I like people to be under the same roof. How can the unfaithful spouse display loving, caring, nurturing behaviors? The other person isn't there. You know, ah, ah, so I, I really prefer that they stay together whenever possible. Sometimes it's not possible and sometimes people do end up separating and I will work with on their relationship after they'd separated, but it's not my preference. You started to mention something about details that she feels like she hasn't gotten the whole deal. I don't know how I missed this. I'm glad you brought it up, but I have had-- you know, what, what often happens is when there is disclosure or somebody finds out about an affair, uhm, and the unfaithful partner begins to share what happened, they withhold information, they don't say the whole thing. And especially if there had been multiple affairs, uhm, only give a partial list of what happened. And what then happens is the healing begins with this partial information and then weeks or maybe some times months later some other parts of the information come out. That is devastating. And in fact, I've had so many betrayed spouses say to me and I know you've heard this too that what was much worse than the infidelity was the leakage of the information overtime because he didn't say the whole thing to me to begin with. So one of the things that I do when I'm working with people is I will encourage them in a very firm way. "I know this is hard. I know that you're thinking you're either protecting yourself or protecting her, you're afraid that, you know, she might wanna divorce you if she knew the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but I'm encouraging you to share the entire information." And I sometimes will do this in the separate session. Uhm, and, and they recognize that I'm on their side because if it, if it comes out later, it's, it's much more difficult to put back together again. I know that wasn't your exact second question but... 

01:31:50
UNKNOWN Well, the second question was, is there a difference in success rate if it's emotional infidelity or if it's just physical or physical and emotional infidelity? 

01:32:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know, I think infidelity is in the eye of the beholder and severity is in the eye of the beholder. And what I mean by that is I've worked with couples where someone has divorced over a kiss and I worked with couples where they've stayed together after someone has had multiple affairs. So it really just depends on what the person who's been betrayed ha-- but meaning they ascribed to it. So I can't say that's worst in that, not only the person in that relationship can say whether it's worst or not. 

01:32:35
UNKNOWN And always clean up your cellphone. I don't know, I've had lots of those cases. Uhm, I work somewhat like you and really, uhm, appreciate your take on this. I've been in a situation where someone has dumped on me, ah, an infidelity in private session. And then the other person repeatedly and obsessively asked me about it. 

01:32:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-hmm. 

01:32:55
UNKNOWN And I am putting the position of lying or, or just, just saying - 

01:33:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No, you're not, no... 

01:33:00
UNKNOWN - or just saying, I can't tell you what was said which is not somehow satisfying to that person, no. And... 

01:33:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, ah, ah, what I would ask you though is you need to ins-- you need to make it incredibly clear before you see them separately that when you see people separately it's confidential information. 

01:33:20
UNKNOWN I do. 

01:33:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And that not to ask about the session because it's not gonna go anywhere. In fact, some therapist who have this, uhm, open, ah, secret policy actually have people sign things - 

01:33:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:33:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS - that they understand what the policy is. 

01:33:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I live in another culture so signing a document is not gonna work. But I do say that. 

01:33:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:33:40
UNKNOWN But I still have had people several that just obsessively every time though, da-da-da-da. And, and what happened, and what did it do, you know I can't show that really, na-na-na-na-na. And does that ever happened or... 

01:33:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well I can actually say that that doesn't happen to me. But what I can't say to you is what I-- if I am to read under your question what I'm hearing you say is the incredibly uncomfortable position - 

01:34:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:34:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS - that you're in. 

01:34:05
UNKNOWN Exactly. 

01:34:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And all I can say to you is when I say to everybody else, "Don't do something that you feel uncomfortable with. Do not do something you're uncomfortable with," regardless of what workshop, seminar, or leader told you it's the right thing to do - 

01:34:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:34:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS - do not do it because you have to be genuine or authentic and real with your client because that's what works. So consume it. 

01:34:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, okay. And would you repeat your, ah, websites? I didn't get it.

01:34:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, thank you for that. I didn't pay here for this. All right, divorcebusting.com and my email address is Michele with one L, M-I-C-H-- I know what I'll do here just for a moment so that you can see this. Uhm, there we go. Uhm, Michelle@DivorceBusting.com. Uhm, and as long as you're on that subject, I'll just sort of tell you that I do intensive training for therapists, uhm, every year in Boulder for three days. It's great fun, lots of videos and I'd love to have you all, join me there also. So... 

01:35:10
UNKNOWN Hi. 

01:35:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, okay. 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN Uhm... 

01:35:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Thank you. Thanks for directing me. I feel like I can't... 

01:35:15
UNKNOWN You mentioned earlier about not paying attention to one have behavior shifts when she moved towards moving away from her, uhm, friend. Uhm, you then went on to mention the huge static shift that you saw in her towards the end of the treatment when she came to two weeks later. Would you also not pay attention to that? And what-- how do you handle that when maybe one of the couples comes and you notice her a, a lot different in the way that they may be dressing or personal care? 

01:35:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, so, ah, ah, I, I wouldn't exactly phrase it as I don't pay attention to it but I would be casual about reported changes or that be much more casual than wow, that's a little bit over the top, okay. And, and, and what I say, I would probably say something to her-- uhm, I might or I might not, it would appropriate. I think to say, "You look great. You know, you look really relaxed. You look great," uhm, because that could have lots of different meaning and I'm sure she would just like it. But, uhm, if, if-- I would necessarily sa-- let's say, I'm suspecting someone's having an affair and they've lost 20 pounds and they're working out, and I wouldn't necessarily comment on that and ask about that in terms of, you know, my suspicions about it, uhm, I probably wouldn't do that. I can't believe how many people are having affairs with their personal trainers. So you're experiencing this, I mean, not you personally, but you know, it's just mind-boggling to me. Uhm, yes. 

01:36:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, could you address any treatment and consideration specific to our heightened in importance in the cases of the same sex couples or, or if emotional fear versus non-emotional fear? Uhm, and others in that case and also, uhm, you've mentioned the people who just decide that affairs even though they enjoy their marriage, what's behind that and what are the treatment implications? 

01:37:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Do you have any more questions to add to that list? Ah, well, okay, so what wa-- and you're expecting me to remember? And, and I ran out of estrogen so, you know, it's not gonna happen. What was the first one? 

01:37:30
UNKNOWN Could you speak-- one, the treatment implication differences if, if there are any with, with same sex couples and, and then what is the phenomenon behind the person who just, uhm, decides to have an affair... 

01:37:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Wait, wait, wait, there with the one question in a time. So same sex couples. I think many of the, uhm, many of the situations are similar. I mean, ah, ah, there probably are some differences. I occasionally work with same sex couples. Uhm, I, I can't say that there's preponderance of same sex couples in my practice but it does happen. But I think many of the emotional issues are very, very similar. Uhm, and to your second question about why someone would just have an affair, I mean, it, it... 

01:38:10
UNKNOWN And where do you-- and what the-- that where do you direct your treatment focus or does it change it? 

01:38:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, it doesn't change it. It doesn't change my focus. Uhm, I, I don't, I don't really delve into what I think-- ah, ah, in other words, if someone says that, "I really loved my wife but I had an affair anyway," it, it wouldn't change anything that I would do in terms of working with them, in terms of the program that I described. It doesn't, it doesn't matter. Uhm, because as I said, now that they've had the affair, there's a problem in the relationship. It doesn't matter what happened before, there's something to be worked on in that. Ah, yes, over there. 

01:38:50
UNKNOWN Hi. Uhm, this is a question for my colleague there. Uhm, he's working with the couple that's very similar to the video clip that you showed. Ah, ah, but the problem is she's decided to, uhm, ah, leave her affair partner and stay with her husband. Ah, but now when he encouraged her to have sex with her husband again, she is just really unable to get herself to do that and she's just getting into depression. Ah, you know, frequent crying spells and anger and things like that. And, and she frequently writes to him saying, ah, "It's very hard for me to, uhm, you know, become intimate with him again. I'm not able to forget the other guy but I know that I have to stay in this marriage so I have no idea what to do." So, ah, what would... 

01:39:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And, and, and can you say one more time what she said about forgetting the other guy? 

01:39:35
UNKNOWN So, ah, she decided to stay in the marriage... 

01:39:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No, no, did you say she needs to forget the other guy, is that... 

01:39:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

01:39:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. So, you, you know, if, if I were her therapist, actually, uhm, I'm trying to think. I think it was a letter, an email that I got from somebody who said, uhm, that she had had an affair. She gave the affair of five years previous and that she found herself really continuing-- and she know she made the right decision, or at least she think she does, but she finds herself like longing for this relationship and thinking about him. And, uhm, she doesn't wanna feel in her life that she's made this huge mistake. And I wrote back to her kind of what I said to all of you before is that just because you have a loving feelings for this person and you think about this person from time to time or even a lot doesn't-- it's not an indication that you shouldn't be in your marriage. You're entitled to those feelings. You had a good relationship with this person and you can take those feelings with you to your grave. They're yours. You own them. No one could take those feelings away from you. That's okay to have those feelings. There is the difference between how you feel and how you act. It's okay. And she wrote me back and she said, "That was the simplest solution. I don't know why I didn't do that." So I think part of what this woman might be struggling with and without speaking with her I really don't know is that she's grieving, she's missing him, and she's interpreting that as having made the wrong decision and it's difficult to be intimate with someone. There may be many other reasons but I certainly would be having, you know, individual-- an individual session with her to find out a little bit more about what she's feeling and why she's feeling that way. 

01:41:30
UNKNOWN So, uhm, would you, ah, try and work with the husband at all or he doesn't come into, at least she... 

01:41:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS No, I would. Ah, you know, it's possible that part of her depression is because there's something that's happening or not happening in their marriage. And I wanna take a look-- a systemic look at that as well, absolutely, absolutely. 

01:41:45
UNKNOWN Hi. 

01:41:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Hi. 

01:41:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, I'm working-- I'm over here. 

01:41:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, sorry. 

01:41:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, I'm working at an individual client whose wife had an affair about two years ago. Uhm, and even though he feels like he's forgiven his wife he's still harboring a lot of anger toward the man with whom she had the affair and he feels like he can't fully move on from it until he confronts the man. And obviously, that's not an option that I want him to take. So I'm just wondering if you have any advice on how to deal with this situation when there's a lot of anger toward, uhm, the other person in this situation. 

01:42:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uhm, did I hear you say not a si-- not, uhm, an action that you want him to take? 

01:42:25
UNKNOWN I'm just-- I don't want him to confront the man with whom she had the affair. 

01:42:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah, that's what I was, uhm, clarifying. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:42:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So I guess what I would wanna know was how would his wife feel about his confronting this other person? 

01:42:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, she doesn't want that to happen either. I'm worried it would be like a, a physical fight. 

01:42:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS A physical fight. 

01:42:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:42:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS A physical fight. 

01:42:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:42:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. And then the reason I just asked you about it, I think we have to be really careful about it not being our values but the values of the people with whom we're working. So if, if you-- does he-- he has a tendency toward violence? 

01:43:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:43:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Not a good one. Uhm, so, what does he telling you that-- what does his goal? What are their goals in working with you right now? 

01:43:10
UNKNOWN He feels he's never gonna be able to fully move on from it - 

01:43:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-hmm. 

01:43:15
UNKNOWN - until he confronts the man. He feels like there's a lot of anger that he can't resolve just within his marriage because he's so mad at this other person and he's, you know, an angry guy in general. 

01:43:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Uh-hmm. 

01:43:25
UNKNOWN So he's just not sure, you know, whether to proceed with this marriage, you know, and, and not confront this guy and just feel angry forever or if he should go after this person. 

01:43:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So, I guess, I mean, ah, you know, I can think of a couple of possibilities, one might be the possibility, and I don't know if this is a friend or someone they both know. I mean, it sort of depends on the contest... 

01:43:45
UNKNOWN He doesn't know the person. 

01:43:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He doesn't know the per-- I mean, one possibility is he could write an email to the guy where there's no, you know, threat or, or violence. But, but the other thing is to work with him about times in the past where he's been incredibly angry about something and he thought he wasn't gonna get through it, but he got through it anyway. How did he do that? You know, so that he can begin to imagine how he might be able to apply those things, skills to this particular situation. 

01:44:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:44:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah, let's take a couple more questions and... 

01:44:20
UNKNOWN So my question is about co-- a couple who can't... 

01:44:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And then they will have affairs. Okay, go ahead, sorry. 

01:44:25
UNKNOWN So, uhm, I'm working with a couple who can't make it through the transition phase. So I'm actually seeing them after they've already been in six years of counseling post-affair. There has been no more affairs, they care about their marriage, but it's her constant insecurity bringing it to him, him reassuring her, going through all the steps, being there, but now that's the pattern in their marriage that they've recreated, and they can't get out of that. 

01:44:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Ah, okay, are you positive that he's reassuring her in a loving way, in a specific way and doing the things that she's saying she needs? 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:45:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:45:05
UNKNOWN I mean, I've really been present with them while he's doing that. 

01:45:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, this will take a departure from everything that I've told you so with people have left the room they're not gonna get the good stuff here. So there's a very, ah, you know, in life I think you are effective if you do more what works and less of what doesn't work, okay. And so even though what I told you stands and sticks with the general way of working and sometimes for long periods of time, if you start to notice that it becomes a pattern that's making things worse, in other words if he's truly comforting her, truly giving her information, and she continues to, uhm, hound him for more and more and more and it's not a laying for fears, then I would really suggest it's time for you to coach him to do something different, to do sort of the opposite of what he's been doing. Uhm, now I know this is gonna sound strange coming from a divorce buster but, uhm, I, I really-- ah, when people get into deeply and trench patterns like that and I suggest that somebody do something really different. It might-- I, I, I have to know them and I would be very careful with this, but I might ask him to act as if he's gotten to the point where he loves her, he wants to be with her, but he doesn't know how much longer he can handle the questions. 

01:46:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:46:40
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And that I would probably coach him to begin in a gentle way to pull away from her. Just... 

01:46:45
UNKNOWN He's done that. 

01:46:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS He's done that. And how is she responding to it? 

01:46:50
UNKNOWN Frantic. 

01:46:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, oh, okay, perfect. 

01:46:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, frantic. 

01:46:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. And then my que-- and I... 

01:46:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well wait a second. That's perfect. 

01:46:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:47:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You want her to be frantic because it isn't until people get to that really uncomfortable stage that they're willing to make a change. She might have to realize that this isn't going where-- anywhere. She's going to have to make a change if she wants to keep him in her life. So that's, that's what I would say. I know that sounds really different from what I've been saying, but-- and not so different because I'm telling you that no single approach works the same way with everybody. So you have to-- I mean, this is the, this is the thing about being experienced in working with couples is that you have to know what to do. If what you're doing isn't working, there needs to be something else to do and that would be the something else I would suggest that you have to do - 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:47:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS - or have him do. 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's great. Thank you. 

01:47:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS All right. All right. You're very welcome. One more question. 

01:47:50
UNKNOWN Over here. 

01:47:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh! 

01:47:50
UNKNOWN Thanks. Ah, yes, uhm, ah, a lot of times in my experience it's actually the betrayer who request the couples therapy, you know, not the, not the betrayed, it's not the victim. 

01:48:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Right. 

01:48:00
UNKNOWN And so a lot of times then there is resistance on the victims, ah, apart and, ah, which really becomes a barrier to the couples therapy because they, you know, they don't even necessarily wanna be there. Ah, you know, that they're not-- so, so I know at the beginning you said that these, these steps are really for people that are both wanting-- both willing to do the work. 

01:48:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Yes. 

01:48:20
UNKNOWN And but I imagine a lot of times you don't have couples where they're both willing to do the work. Can you comment a little bit as to some strategies? 

01:48:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. Good question. So what do you do when-- well, you, you heard his question, I don't need to repeat them so I used to doing it. Uhm, so, ah, ah, you know, I might begin by trying to offer some strategies to get her to come in if she-- ah, and to find out what he's done first of all, to try to get her to come in. So I know that to eliminate that that isn't gonna work, that isn't gonna work. Uhm, but, but for example, uhm, sometimes when I'm working with couples where one person wants the marriage and the other doesn't, I get the person who doesn't wanna come in not on the basis of working on the marriage. They're so determined to get out of the marriage that, that basically what they're told is that they're coming to my office, uhm, to get some closure on their marriage and the problems that they've having, some understanding so that if they go on to divorce that they're not going to repeat the same patterns in future relationships. So I might try a different approach to getting this person in. But if I don't get that person in, and again, I remind you too that the, the, the divorce busting telephone coaching program, that's what it is, it's talking to one person. Ah, what's different about that is the person who's been unfaithful doesn't have much leverage if someone really doesn't wanna be in marriage because they're so upset about what happened. And so what I try to do is to-- and, and again, this was part of my workshop, It Takes One to Tango. Uhm, what I try to do is to ascertain what is it that in addition to the infidelity, cuz we know that your spouse is you know, you know, miserable about this disclosure, at this discovery. But what is it about your marriage that your spouse has been unhappy about. Can you identify, uhm, the parts of your marriage that if your spouse were here your spouse would be saying this doesn't work for me? And begin to help the person sitting in my office to do those behaviors that might soften the person sitting at home. Uhm, in terms of all the behaviors on the list, I might suggest that the person do some of those things, uhm, whether it's being incredibly remorseful, whether it's, uhm, showing empathy, whether it's saying I'm sorry, whether it's helping more around the house with the kids, and I see you have something you wanna say about that. 

01:51:05
UNKNOWN I will just follow up. A lot of times they're quietly suffering before the affair. And, and so now then they think that they have to make it about them even more in order to save... 

01:51:15
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Who-- wait, wait, who's, who's quietly suffering? 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN The, the, the one who went, went outside the marriage, the betrayer. 

01:51:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Okay. 

01:51:20
UNKNOWN I'm thinking of a case in specific where, I mean, he... 

01:51:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS They're silently suffering and now they have to do more. 

01:51:25
UNKNOWN And now they have to do more. Right. Because... 

01:51:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Too bad. 

01:51:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:51:30
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS I mean, if they wanna save the marriage, it's too bad. Because, look, if you don't wanna save the marriage, let's talk what-- how can I help you? 

01:51:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:51:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What are you doing here? If you wanna save the marriage, and you wanna get more out of your marriage eventually, let's talk about what you-- you don't even have her attention now. The first thing you have to do is get her attention. Once you have her attention, then we can talk about her being more sexual, her being kind or her being less critical. Let-- but you don't have any leverage now. You first have to get her attention. Let's talk about what that might be. 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:52:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So that's, that's how I would coach that person. And if he doesn't want the marriage, that's a different subject. But apparently, he does. So, okay. Thank you all you so much for coming, I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
