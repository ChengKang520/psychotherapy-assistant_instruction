CLINICAL DEMONSTRATION 04 

00:00:20
BEYOND CALMING DOWN:HYPNOSIS, ANXIETY, AND THE NEED FOR ACTION OVER AVOIDANCE 

00:00:20
LYNN LYONS, LICSW 

00:00:35
LYNN LYONS What a nice crowd, thanks for coming. I love a crowd. Oh, look all these familiar faces. Umm… So we are gonna do a clinical demonstration. Umm… Erin is my subject. She has very generously decided to put herself in this vulnerable position, umm… and this is a clinical demonstration on how I would incorporate hypnosis h… into somebody who's dealing with anxiety. So Erin is anxious. Uh… She's anxious because she's anxious and also 'cause she's sitting up here in front of all these people. So uh… I think we all need to certainly appreciate her putting herself up there. So let's all give Erin a round of applause. And right now if she had thought bubbles over her head, she would be like, "Stop looking at me, stop looking at me", so. Umm… What I'm going to do is I'm going to interview Erin, I don't know her. Umm… She was kind enough to volunteer and she gave me just a little three-line email about herself. So I'm going to get some information and then we're gonna do this session. Umm… What I want you to pay attention to a few things in this session is that when it comes to me treating anxiety, being calm is not my first priority, for the person who is anxious. This is not going to be a session about relaxing and being calm. I want you to pay attention to what I am going to lead her toward in the direction that I am building in terms of her momentum of dealing with our anxiety. I think a lot of what happens when we think of hypnosis with anxiety is it's all about relaxation and calmness and I think that that misses huge opportunities umm… to be able to develop some really important skills. The goal of the hypnosis session is not to have her feel calm when she's sitting up here, that's easy. The goal is to give her things to work on when her anxiety shows up when she leaves here and steps out into the world. So that's my mindset going in. My mindset is also is that I am teaching to the gap, I am gonna find out what she does well and what she doesn't do, and then I'm going to teach to the gap. The phrase that I use a lot when I'm dealing with anxiety is that we need to be careful not to do the disorder. And a lot of anxiety treatment and a lot of what teachers do, I work a lot with kids but a lot of teachers and parents and even therapists do is that they are actually replicating and giving the anxiety what it's looking for. My goal is to offer the opposite. So that's just sort of a little framework of how I think and where we're going with this. So please make sure your cell phones are off. Please respect that umm… this is Erin's session. She is here for a real issue, which means that it is of the utmost importance that we respect and be quiet while she is doing this. Umm… And then after we're done, we will take questions and I will give Erin the option of whether or not she wants to answer questions from her that is a from you guys, that is going to be totally up to her, but I'll take questions from you. All right, we good? All right. I'm gonna take off my sweater too. 

00:04:00
ERIN I might die when they start sweating. 

00:04:00
LYNN LYONS Okay. Is your mic on? Okay. 

00:04:10
ERIN I'm now. 

00:04:10
LYNN LYONS All right. So welcome. Thank you. 

00:04:15
ERIN Thank you. 

00:04:15
LYNN LYONS Do you want me to get a cup of water? 

00:04:15
ERIN Okay, thank you. 

00:04:20
LYNN LYONS All right, so tell me if you were to leave here, which you are going to eventually, and you're gonna think back and you're going to think, "You know what, I did that session with Lynn Lyons and it was really helpful and successful because…" How would you answer that question? 

00:04:40
ERIN I think I would answer it because I'm either less anxious or because I have better skills to address and deal with it in the future and then hopefully I can take those skills and use them with patients in my own practice. So I'm looking for both personal skills and then things I can translate to use with other people. 

00:04:55
LYNN LYONS Okay, so this is going to be both a personal experience for you, but there's also gonna be a part of you that's gonna be interested in what I'm doing. 

00:05:10
ERIN Likely. 

00:05:10
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Umm… So can you tell me a little bit about yourself, just so I have a little bit of an idea of who you are and…? 

00:05:20
ERIN Let's see. I'm the oldest of four children. I think I've been anxious most of my life. 

00:05:20
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:05:25
ERIN I think the onset was being bullied really badly in school as a kid. 

00:05:25
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:05:25
ERIN And then things happen and it just changes over time. 

00:05:30
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:05:30
ERIN Umm… I'm a newly graduated doctor. I'm not a therapist. I've never been through hypnosis. 

00:05:35
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:05:35
ERIN Umm… I… I am anxious around the idea that decisions I make every day have the real potential hurt people. And so making mistakes have real consequences. 

00:05:45
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:05:45
ERIN And I take that very seriously, and I think the idea around not making mistakes is kind of a theme, kind of the perfectionism theme in the sense that I thought as a kid if I just don't give them a reason to pick on me, maybe they'll finally leave me alone. And so I think that… that's translated throughout life, if I can just not rock the boat, not give people a reason to laugh at me, feel humiliated. I mean, insult or whatever feeling is there, I think that's kind of been a thread or a commonality that has run throughout. I was more depressed when I was younger and I think as I become an adult, I'm definitely more anxious and it also runs in my family. 

00:06:25
LYNN LYONS Okay. So anxious parents? 

00:06:30
ERIN Uh… My father deals with pretty severe generalized anxiety and as well as depression in his entire family has a whole wide variety of issues around that. 

00:06:35
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:06:35
ERIN Have issues around that. 

00:06:35
LYNN LYONS Okay. And so in dealing with your anxiety for all of these years, what has worked for you? 

00:06:45
ERIN Over achieving. 

00:06:45
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:06:50
ERIN Being on time. I get really anxious, like if I have a class or I'm supposed to be somewhere, if I'm not five minutes early, I'm late. Like showing up when something's already started, it makes me anxious. Disrespecting other people's time. 

00:07:00
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:07:00
ERIN You know, I feel like it's really important, if you say you're gonna be somewhere, you're gonna do something, you show up. 

00:07:05
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:07:05
ERIN And so umm… not being able to do that or, you know, and then you fall into the chronic apologies syndrome of being a woman, and culture, and all those things. 

00:07:15
LYNN LYONS Okay. Umm… So what happens when you do school up? 

00:07:20
ERIN Umm… I think it depends on what. For example, umm… test things, you know, I just graduated from medical school, etcetera. So I did incredibly well and I've always been at the top or towards the top of anything I've ever done, at least academically. And so I think I latched onto that as a vehicle to move forward. And so being hyper alert or putting more energy into detail, in a way it's bad and that it pays off. 

00:07:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:07:50
ERIN And I'm rewarded for it because I do well and I got to where I wanna go, so… 

00:07:55
LYNN LYONS Yeah. What happens when you do screw up? 

00:08:00
ERIN I think part of it goes into that tachycardia, the sweating, the oh my god, oh my god, and I think it's more the anticipation of how someone might react. And then I find when I have to go through a conversation or I have to be like I screwed this up. Umm… It's not nearly as bad as what I perceive it to be. I think I'm by far my own worst enemy when it comes to kind of catastrophizing, if that makes sense. 

00:08:25
LYNN LYONS So there's a lot of internal competition. 

00:08:25
ERIN Yeah, there's a lot of negative self-talk around that. Like, I can't believe you did this, you know, and I always feel like the punitive, effective that would be much worse or much more severe, what I do to myself is probably worse than anything, anybody would do to me, if that makes sense. 

00:08:45
LYNN LYONS Yeah. And so you know that and you've had a lot of experience with this. What is it that… that doesn't sort of sink in about that? 

00:08:55
ERIN I don't know. That's a good question. Umm… I think cognitively when I step back and separate from my physiological experience of heart racing, racing thoughts, all of that and then, if I can kind of intellectually step back from the emotional component of it, I can logically and rationally understand that. But in the moment, that's not the headspace that I'm in. And I think depending on what the issue is, or what the task is, or what's… or if it's something that doesn't necessarily have a distinct endpoint. Like, I'm gonna be a doctor for a long time or I'm never gonna pay off these loans. So, you know, I've got… and I'm a brand-new baby doctor. So it's going to be a long time and a lot of years of having to make difficult decisions, you know, and I had a relationship recently and I thought it was ending, you know, moving towards getting married and I think I have a lot of anxiety around, you know, I chose to do medicine, I chose to do these things and does not mean that I inadvertently gave up the right to… or give up the possibility of getting married, and having a family, and all the things that are really important to me while during this and being who I am and where I am right now is absolutely where I believe and feel truly that I'm meant to be. And so I think part of the hard part for me is my anxiety isn't necessarily around a particular thing like fear of flying or it's kind of more nebulous and generalized, and it has to do with very real things that it makes sense that you might be anxious around, if that makes sense. 

00:10:30
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:10:30
ERIN So it's harder and on a day-to-day basis, as you go through the minutes of your life and do what you have to do, it's hard to kind of… it creeps up. 

00:10:40
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:10:40
ERIN Or you don't… you know, then it's there and you're like, oh, okay, this will go however long, but it's always kind of running in the background that doesn't change. 

00:10:45
LYNN LYONS Right, it's always there. 

00:10:50
ERIN Right, it's never… you're never really free of it. It just pops in and out in more severity. 

00:10:55
LYNN LYONS And when it pops in, what do you do? 

00:11:00
ERIN I think it depends on the context in which it comes up, but umm… for example, I took my board exam this summer, clinical boards, and we had some really horribly written questions, etcetera umm… and I was fairly certain I failed at a particular section of it that's required to get a license. 

00:11:15
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:11:20
ERIN And afterwards, it's like I kept ruminating, I had nightmares for two weeks and literally the same questions that I'm like oh my god, I can't believe I picked the wrong one or oh, my god I can't, you know, I walked eight miles up and down the mountain afterwards to try to… and movement always kind of helps, I feel like anxiety has an energy behind it. And so when I move, when I exercise, when I do things, you know, I don't do all sitting still. And so when I do things that kind of helps but it doesn't change this beating yourself up for kind of not being perfect, I guess that's the best distilled summary, it's like beating up because you made errors regardless of what the degree of… 

00:12:00
LYNN LYONS Well, you think you made errors. 

00:12:00
ERIN Right. 

00:12:00
LYNN LYONS Maybe you made errors. 

00:12:05
ERIN Right. 

00:12:05
LYNN LYONS Maybe not 'cause that part that you were worried about that you failed, apparently you didn't. 

00:12:10
ERIN I did not. 

00:12:10
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:12:15
ERIN And I did way better than a lot of my peers. So not only do I… and I think that happens pretty frequently. 

00:12:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah, that you do when? 

00:12:25
ERIN Like, when… 

00:12:25
LYNN LYONS Uh-huh. 

00:12:25
ERIN I don't get under a 90% on anything in all of the medical school, which to me is like… 

00:12:30
LYNN LYONS In all of medical school, you didn't get under a 90%? 

00:12:35
ERIN No, on anything. So it's like… but to me, it's like oh my God, you know… 

00:12:40
LYNN LYONS Oh, my God, what? 

00:12:40
ERIN Well, no, it's when you're… I guess, I don't know. What you're used to being, cheering and you're like oh no, I'm here. I think my sense of failure is different than the average person's sense of failure, perhaps, you know. 

00:12:55
LYNN LYONS It's all relative. 

00:12:55
ERIN My expectations are a bit different. 

00:13:00
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:00
ERIN Yeah. 

00:13:00
LYNN LYONS Yeah, okay. 

00:13:00
ERIN So… 

00:13:00
LYNN LYONS So it's tiring in there. 

00:13:05
ERIN It's exhausting. 

00:13:05
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:13:05
ERIN Yeah. I think I would really love to feel okay being average. I don't even know what that means. 

00:13:10
LYNN LYONS I don't think you're ever going to be average. 

00:13:15
ERIN Well, that's unfortunate. 

00:13:20
LYNN LYONS Yeah. I think that maybe we can make some things average, but you don't strike me as… 

00:13:30
ERIN Maybe balanced is a better word. 

00:13:30
LYNN LYONS I think that's a better word, yeah. 

00:13:35
ERIN I think balanced feeling like… I always feel like I'm constantly not doing enough, but I finished… like, I'm finishing my fifth degree in June, you know, like I'm… 

00:13:45
LYNN LYONS How do you know when you've done enough? 

00:13:45
ERIN I wish I knew. I don't. And I think that's the underlying message is I constantly feel like, I'm not doing enough. But when I look at everyday people, I'm guessing they probably don't even an average day, don't… You know, they say you'll learn and forget more in your years of medical school than most people ever have to learn and retain on a lifetime. 

00:14:05
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:14:10
ERIN You know, but to me, it's like that doesn't register because I've always been really high-functioning and I've always been, you know, so my sense of what's normal and what's acceptable is like just being distorted by that. And it wasn't. parents pushing me, it wasn't anything like that. Like, it's just the way I've been my whole life. 

00:14:30
LYNN LYONS Okay, all right. So just so you know, the goal of this session will not be to make you mediocre. 

00:14:45
ERIN I can accept that. 

00:14:45
LYNN LYONS All right. Because I think that would be a setup for the both of us. 

00:14:50
ERIN Okay. 

00:14:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah. Okay. All right, you ready? 

00:14:55
ERIN Yes. 

00:14:55
LYNN LYONS All right. So here's how this works. I talk… 

00:15:00
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:00
LYNN LYONS …you listen. 

00:15:05
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:05
LYNN LYONS I already know you're good at doing that. Umm… At some point, I will check in with you. 

00:15:10
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:10
LYNN LYONS You will hear me. 

00:15:10
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:15
LYNN LYONS You've never done this before, so you're not gonna be, you know, gone somewhere and… 

00:15:20
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:20
LYNN LYONS …I'm not going to ask you to do things that you will remember. 

00:15:25
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:25
LYNN LYONS Umm… I will check in with you. It will sound something like this. I will say Erin, in a few moments, I'm going to check in with you. I'm just curious and I'll ask you a question. It will probably be something along the lines of is there anything I said that's particularly ringing true for you, is there anything you'd like to share. 

00:15:40
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:40
LYNN LYONS At that point, you can talk to me. 

00:15:45
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:45
LYNN LYONS Or if you say, "I don't want to", that's fine too. 

00:15:50
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:50
LYNN LYONS But just you know that I'm going to interact with you. Okay? 

00:15:55
ERIN Okay. 

00:15:55
LYNN LYONS This is an interactive thing. I am not doing something to you, we are partners in this. 

00:16:00
ERIN Okay. 

00:16:00
LYNN LYONS Okay? 

00:16:00
ERIN Yep. 

00:16:00
LYNN LYONS All right. So thank you for all of that the information, it's nice to have somebody so articulate to work with. 

00:16:10
ERIN Yeah. 

00:16:10
LYNN LYONS I work with kids a lot and they sometimes go, "I don't know." So thanks. Although, I don't know is a very helpful answer at times but… 

00:16:15
ERIN It's ironic, it's one the population I'm afraid to work with because kids are so different than adults. 

00:16:20
LYNN LYONS Oh, but they're not. All right, you ready? 

00:16:25
ERIN Ready. 

00:16:30
LYNN LYONS Okay, so first thing I want to do is just kind of arrange yourself in a way. 

00:16:35
ERIN Yep. Okay. 

00:16:35
LYNN LYONS And just you just did that nice kind of letting it go breath, right? Yeah, good. So all of these people are just going to be quiet and it's just you and me. 

00:16:45
ERIN Okay. 

00:16:50
LYNN LYONS All right? So go ahead when you're ready. I want you to just allow your eyes to close when you're comfortable, just because I want you to be able to just go inside a little bit. And, you know, one of the things that's kind of interesting about this process… and you made mention of it is how much our thinking, and our anticipating, and our imagining has an impact on our physical self, on our emotional self, on the choices we make. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
LYNN LYONS And just as a little illustration, Erin. I want you just to imagine for a moment that you and I are experiencing just a very gradual, almost imperceptible increase in gravity. So your eyelids feel a little heavier than usual. That's right. And your feet, and your hands, and your body can just sink into the chair. 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
LYNN LYONS And I already know what a good student you are, and I'm already watching you. Continue with that. 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:05
LYNN LYONS And so here we have this new experience, this thing you've never done before, this willingness to step in. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:30
LYNN LYONS And you're right, when you think about yourself that you do things that not everybody would do, that you step into things that not everyone would step into. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
LYNN LYONS There's this part of you, that's rather daring, rather courageous, and certainly curious. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:30
LYNN LYONS This willingness to learn, and to experience, to go after things. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
LYNN LYONS I was talking to a client of mine last week. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:00
LYNN LYONS And the conversation was about the different parts that we all have. 

00:21:10
[sil.] 

00:21:15
LYNN LYONS And how we pick and choose the part of us that we'll use for the job at hand. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:35
LYNN LYONS That when we're in our work environment, we might have one persona. When we're with our friends, we might have another one. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
LYNN LYONS That there are things that will do over here, that we choose not to do over there. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:10
LYNN LYONS And I don't know if this will surprise you or not, but this whole conversation that we were having… 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:25
LYNN LYONS …was revolving around his need to be perfect. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:45
LYNN LYONS And the conclusion that I was hoping he would come to is that she gets to pick and choose… 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
LYNN LYONS …what needs a lot of attention and what doesn't, what needs a certain amount of effort, and where he can coast. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
LYNN LYONS when he cut himself a little bit of a break. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:40
LYNN LYONS And when he really needs to buckle down. 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
LYNN LYONS It really is okay to achieve. It really is okay to be curious and to work hard, to discover things about yourself. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
LYNN LYONS It really is okay to want to be good or even great at what you do. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:40
LYNN LYONS I had to find a new dentist recently. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:50
LYNN LYONS And so I was asking my friends about who they saw, about their experiences. And I didn't say to any of them, "I'm hoping to find a mediocre dentist. Who do you recommend?" 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:30
LYNN LYONS And when people come to see me… 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
LYNN LYONS I don't introduce myself as Lynn Lyons, mediocre social worker. That's not what the M stands for. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:10
LYNN LYONS But about five years ago, I was talking to a 10-year-old, who probably could have been you. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
LYNN LYONS And she was telling me about how things need to be a certain way, about how she worries, about screwing up her 10-year-old things. 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
LYNN LYONS And how she worries about handling 20-year-old things, and 30-year-old things, and 40-year-old things. She told me that she worries about doing her taxes. Now that's a planner. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:30
LYNN LYONS And as I was talking to her, I was giving her my flexibility speech, offering her my wisdom about how perfection is so exhausting. And I jokingly said to her, "Well, accept if you grow u to be a brain surgeon and accept if you're mind brain surgeon, then go ahead and be perfect." And her mom who is sitting next to me, who I just met, sort of meekly raised her hand and said, "I'm a brain surgeon." And I felt my face get hot. And I apologized, I don't know why. 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:55
LYNN LYONS She said there's a saying in brain surgery, "Perfection is the enemy of good." 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
LYNN LYONS She said, "When you're in somebody's brain, hanging out, and making sure that everything is perfect is when you get into trouble. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
LYNN LYONS Spending too much time trying to fix it all. It creates more problems than it solves. 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:55
LYNN LYONS So I go in and I get out." And I thanked her sincerely, and I told her I would remember that moment, and I do. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:30
LYNN LYONS You see, Erin, the trouble when we stay inside, the trouble when we hangout too long inside is that we miss some important learning. We miss the evidence. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:20
LYNN LYONS There's really something so valuable about learning. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:40
LYNN LYONS When to go in and when to get out. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:31:55
LYNN LYONS Now you just finished medical school, and you probably know more about this yourself than I'll ever know, and I have no doubt that you are so filled with knowing. 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:35
LYNN LYONS But there's one thing you said that caught my attention. 

00:32:45
[sil.] 

00:32:50
LYNN LYONS That you will learn and forget more in medical school than most people will learn in a lifetime. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:05
LYNN LYONS And I'm here to just remind you that there are some things really worth forgetting, that there are some things that are really okay to move on from. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:45
LYNN LYONS You've learned facts, and anatomy, and formulas. You've learned things that I don't even know how to describe or put into words. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
LYNN LYONS You are a student acquiring new knowledge, and perhaps it's okay to forget about, let go off, move on from some outgrown lessons. 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:35:00
LYNN LYONS Perhaps, as you enter this new aspect of your career, of your life, of your growth. Perhaps, there are some patterns. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:45
LYNN LYONS I often tell my teenage clients to go through their closets and bring me back one piece of clothing that they loved when they purchased it and that they wouldn't be caught in now for anything or to sing for me the song they knew by heart when they were 12. 

00:36:40
[sil.] 

00:36:45
LYNN LYONS In front of me is a person who learns, and grows, and steps forward. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
LYNN LYONS Who moves, who moves. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
LYNN LYONS Isn't it nice to know about those aspects, those achievements. 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
LYNN LYONS Those strengths? 

00:37:50
[sil.] 

00:37:55
LYNN LYONS Now in a moment, Erin, I'm gonna just check in with you. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:10
LYNN LYONS And you'll be able to speak with me, if you choose. In a way that feels easy and natural, you'll be able to stay just as focused as you've been for these last few minutes and what I'd like you to share with me if it works for you is anything that you've been thinking about as I've been talking, anything that's been going on inside of you as you've been listening to me? 

00:38:50
ERIN Relief. 

00:38:50
LYNN LYONS Relief? 

00:38:55
ERIN Yeah. The ability to let go of things and go forward without them hanging on to you. It's a lot easier to run as a horse than as a pack mule. 

00:39:20
LYNN LYONS What a nice image. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:30
LYNN LYONS Anything else? 

00:39:35
ERIN More acceptance, that it's okay to be or to feel or to whatever it is that I'm. And that as much as my identity has been tied up in my intellectual success, my academic success, and that's been rewarded for the thing that I'm most proud of is my emotional intelligence and my ability to perceive and relate to people. But I've been my anxiety and my whatnot has been so positively rewarded with how I've chosen to deal with it that it's hard to step back from that and I don't know what it feels like to not be in perpetual motion. 

00:40:35
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:40:35
ERIN And I want that for myself, but I struggle to give myself permission to do that or I think that if I slow down or if I stop, my value is no longer there or the same. 

00:40:55
LYNN LYONS Okay. 

00:41:00
ERIN To the external world. 

00:41:00
LYNN LYONS Right. All right, take a nice breath and settle in, just let yourself sink back in. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:20
LYNN LYONS And I think that… Well, I'm not surprised actually that you've been busy internally during this process. 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:45
LYNN LYONS You know, there are… 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
LYNN LYONS …all sorts of different ways that we deal with our energy. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:10
LYNN LYONS There are all sorts of different ways that we deal with our thinking. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
LYNN LYONS I find it very interesting, Erin. 

00:42:35
[sil.] 

00:42:40
LYNN LYONS That one of the parts of you that you recognize is your emotional intelligence and your ability to connect with people. Because I can tell you that in all the years I've been a therapist, nobody has ever asked me the score I got on my licensing exam. 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:35
LYNN LYONS And you're right when you say… 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
LYNN LYONS …that running like a horse is easier than being a pack mule. 

00:44:00
[sil.] 

00:44:10
LYNN LYONS Let me just remind you that there's nothing wrong with running. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:30
LYNN LYONS Especially, when you're doing what you love. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:50
LYNN LYONS And so as you're stepping into this career, being busy and curious, feeling nervous and unsure… 

00:45:15
[sil.] 

00:45:20
LYNN LYONS …Running here and learning there, how nice to know… 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:45
LYNN LYONS …how nice to know… 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
LYNN LYONS …that you can still be amazing, and thoughtful, and connected, and conscientious. 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
LYNN LYONS Without all the baggage. 

00:46:25
[sil.] 

00:46:30
LYNN LYONS You can still be who you are now. Sitting here. Stepping in. And just like that brain surgeon. 

00:46:50
[sil.] 

00:46:55
LYNN LYONS You'll begin to recognize and appreciate that staying inside your head is far less satisfying… 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
LYNN LYONS …than living out here sharing yourself… 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:35
LYNN LYONS with us. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:45
LYNN LYONS I said to a young woman just before I left, sometimes you are not the best person to talk to you about you. 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
LYNN LYONS When you next find yourself running around inside your head, going in circles, when you next finds yourself stuck in that powerful brain of yours. 

00:48:45
[sil.] 

00:48:50
LYNN LYONS You can just remember… 

00:48:55
[sil.] 

00:49:00
LYNN LYONS …you've chosen to share yourself and many people will be far more interested in that. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:25
LYNN LYONS Now in a moment we're going to bring this experience to a close. I want you to just take some time to absorb and process, and I don't know what is going to happen in the future that something I said or something you said is just going to pop into your head and maybe it'll make you smile a little bit, and maybe as you go through the rest of the conference here deciding what to keep and what to forget, you can continue to feel that relief, a little inkling of acceptance, just stepping into a new stage off of this stage. 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:45
LYNN LYONS Emotionally managing you. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:51:00
LYNN LYONS Now when you're ready, you can begin to fully reorient yourself, take your time, you can allow your eyes to open and comeback fully to this room, to this place, moving your body around. 

00:51:20
[sil.] 

00:51:30
ERIN Whoa. 

00:51:30
LYNN LYONS Whoa. How you doing? 

00:51:35
ERIN Good. 

00:51:35
LYNN LYONS Good? 

00:51:35
ERIN Yeah. 

00:51:40
LYNN LYONS All right, just take a moment. Anything you want to say to me? 

00:51:45
ERIN Thank you. 

00:51:45
LYNN LYONS You're welcome. Thank you. 

00:51:50
ERIN I will definitely walk away with some of this. 

00:51:50
LYNN LYONS You get to choose. 

00:51:55
ERIN It's there and as somebody who hasn't eidetic memory for what I hear. It's almost guaranteed. 

00:52:00
LYNN LYONS Fantastic. Yeah. Umm… Are you willing to take questions from people? Is that all right? 

00:52:10
ERIN Yep. 

00:52:10
LYNN LYONS Okay, let's dramatically swivel our chairs this way. 

00:52:15
ERIN Can I make a quick comment? 

00:52:15
LYNN LYONS You can say whatever you want. 

00:52:15
ERIN Just a sidebar. For every little ding and buzz of cell phones that actually is really distracting, and does attract. So I now truly got it when they say please turn your stuff off because it actually would interrupt, and attract, and sidebar what was happening. So just some honest feedback from a participant, I know it doesn't seem like it, but it actually really does make a difference. So piece of constructive criticism from the… 

00:52:50
LYNN LYONS Duly noted. Yeah. So if you have questions for me or for Erin… Can… One second, can you give me a time check? We have five minutes, guys, all right, talk fast. Yes, we need a microphone. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN You answered this already. 

00:53:05
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN But I'd like to hear. Did you learn anything? What… what… what happened to you in the moment, different in some way? 

00:53:15
ERIN Wow. So I started off really tachycardic and when my eyes closed, I could literally see my heartbeat and color behind my eyelids, umm… and in the beginning I think the hardest part was just drowning out the prevalence of my heartbeat from the experience because, you know, I'm an anxious person, I'm in front of a bunch of people, umm… it's nerve-wracking and that's part of the reason I challenge myself to do this. Umm… And as she talked and I was able to kind of settle into it, I would hear the narrative in the background and go forward and backward, and forward and backward to what are the things and… When she said, "It's okay to forget", that really kind of clicked and it's like instantaneously I felt something shed like, and that's when the horse versus the pack mule piece came in. It was almost like giving me permission to move forward, and know that I still get to be me on my own terms, and all the good things about me get to go with me. But I don't have to hang on to those narratives that hold me back or that continue to umm… spin me back into a cycle that just goes over and over and that's not productive and that… it's… it's okay and that other people will see that it's… there is more to me than achievement, accomplishment and that competence isn't something I have to convince people of, you know. So I think that was an incredibly excellent gift to get, if that makes sense. And then as I was just listening and she's like, "I'm going to ask you a question", my heart rate would speed up again. It's like, oh no, I come back. Umm… And as a hypnosis experience, it was very interesting. I lost feeling in my hands and my feet at one point. Or I just like, I knew they were there and I couldn't tell if I was sweating or not sweating. Umm… And I'm… my background, I do in medicine and Chinese medicine, I'm finishing my doctorate in that in June, and so my experience is very much feeling my chi, my energy cycle at one point when I had the kind of the forgiveness piece and the letting go, all of a sudden everything stopped and started spinning in the opposite direction. And it's still flowing that way and it's a much less chaotic vortex pace, I feel much more balanced, if that makes sense, so. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:55:50
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Uh… Many of the things that she said, she heard her say it to you outside of the hypnotic state and I was wondering what do you think the made difference to you…? (inaudible). 

00:56:10
ERIN Me or her? 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN You. 

00:56:15
ERIN Oh. 

00:56:15
LYNN LYONS Yeah. 

00:56:20
ERIN Umm… I don't have a basis of comparison because this is the only time I've ever been in a hypnotic state, umm… but I feel like learning vocabulary around therapy because again, I'm not a therapist. They're brought u the idea of trance and being kind of like in that connected space and the zone and I think when we connect to other people in a true honest, fully present state, I think that conveyance could go either way. I was speaking to one of the prisoners the other day and talked about the fact that I do acupuncture and he was like, "Oh, so it's just hypnosis with needles." And I was like, "Yeah, it is." So, you know, I realized that what I do isn't that different. We have a different language but I think you could accomplish this with a true heart-to-heart connection and a true full embodied presence with someone inside or outside of the hypnotic state. I don't know how to do hypnosis, but I have experience of convenience and receiving with people umm… just by virtue of being truly present and truly open. Does that make sense? I don't know if that answers your question but it could go either way. 

00:57:30
LYNN LYONS Anybody else? 

00:57:35
[sil.] 

00:57:40
LYNN LYONS I'm gonna ask… There's a woman behind you, and sorry, for the sake of… 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Sorry. 

00:57:45
LYNN LYONS That's okay. Go ahead. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Could I ask you that same question? What do you feel is different from inside room therapy session with those anecdotes, etcetera? 

00:58:00
LYNN LYONS So what feels different for me is I think the connection, umm… that… umm… for me, when I am doing that versus having a conversation, my goal, remember I work with kids too, so sitting here with Erin, I'm gonna do a very formal session where I'm going to tell her what's gonna happen and she's gonna cooperate because she's such a good student. There are many situations in which that whole setup is not going to happen but I'm going to launch into something hypnotic. My goal is to convey the message in the most memorable way possible and this is just one of the memorable ways of doing that. So it has to do with the ritual of this but it also has to do with what is helpful to me is that when I am doing hypnosis, I am slowing down, and I'm a pretty fast person. And so selfishly, when I have the opportunity to sit in front of Erin, Erin is very articulate and talkative. She was quiet and I got to say what I wanted to say. And my goal was to make her curious and receptive about what was coming next. And one of the things with somebody like Erin is she is so articulate and so intellectual is that if I were just having a conversation with her, she may have a tendency to just back down with an argument to everything that I'm saying. And in this setting, that didn't happen. So I felt like I was able to join Erin in her receptivity. And the thing that's fun for me about doing it is that I heard a few things and one mistake that I made was that I should have said to Erin, you will hear things in the background but I didn't. So note to self. She pays attention to everything. 

01:00:30
ERIN That's very true. 

01:00:30
LYNN LYONS So I didn't do that. 

01:00:30
ERIN But just to piggyback on that, I think and kind of to go back to your question, one thing I think that made the difference in this format is that by priming me that all I had to do was listen, it made it so much… the connection and the strength of it, I think was more direct and more strong like, a fiber optic cable versus dial-up, you know. And so I think that made the difference for me to receive what you had to say, so… 

01:01:00
LYNN LYONS She intellectually works all the time, and as soon as she sat down, I said to her, and I don't know if we were even on at that point, I said to her, "This is time for me to work and you to listen." I… I made that suggestion immediately because she is always at work. I wanted to give her some time off. 

01:01:25
ERIN It was awesome. 

01:01:25
LYNN LYONS All right. All right. We are done, thank you for… Okay.
