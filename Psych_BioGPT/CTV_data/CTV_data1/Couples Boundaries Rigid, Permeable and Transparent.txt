UNKNOWN So… And now boundaries, what a fascinating topic. It seems as though boundaries come in two flavors. There are internal and external boundaries. And the boundary issues never ever stop challenging us, they never go away. When you say yes to one thing, you are also saying no to possibilities in other places of your life as an internal boundary. The pain of saying no to possibilities is so great for some people is that they really hate to make decisions because it means saying no to something else. Every boundary is a decision. But how are you gonna know who you can become if you never push yourself beyond your own natural boundaries. Then are external boundaries, those are boundaries with other people and the environment. I like the phrase when it comes to boundaries with another person. The phrase is "No can be a complete sentence." But saying no to somebody just set the… sets the stage. You have to keep on maintaining that boundary, which is a challenge after you say no. Which is why I am so glad that we have three panelists here to sort out the complexities of boundaries. And what's even better is that each panelist, which we have Rick Miller, Martha Kauppi and Janina Fisher. Each panelist has a different perspective on boundaries. Is that cool? So it's not just going to be everybody up here singing Kumbaya, having the same thought, feeling an approach to boundaries. No, that's what makes for a good panelist. What they will do is each person will have up to 10 minutes, count them 10 minutes to give their reflections on boundaries. After each person has up to 10 minutes then they will have a discussion among themselves about yes, I agree, or here's where I differ, and that's what makes things interesting. And then we will have questions and answers from you guys, and here's what's gonna be even better. When you come up to ask a question and you start speaking into the microphone and saying, "My question is," that puts a boundary around, wandering around and gets right to the point. So it really is my pleasure to have these three panelists clear up the mystery of boundaries. And Rick is gonna go first by almost unanimous consent… consensus. Thank you, Rick. 

00:03:25
RICK MILLER Great to be here. How's the sound? Not good. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN Can't hear you. 

00:03:25
RICK MILLER Can't hear me. Ah, you can hear me now? I'm just talking to hear how it sounds, all good? 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:03:35
RICK MILLER I don't want to go too much into the microphone. So I'm Rick Miller. I'm a gay male psychotherapist and I decided to trap you all into being here with me to talk about boundaries within the gay male community for couples. It's a very, very tricky issue, something that I struggle with as a therapist. So I'm gonna talk about rigid permeable and transparent boundaries. And first thing that I was thinking about was our role as psychotherapists. Is it up to us to challenge the norms of the gay male community? Or is it up to us to take the norms of the gay male community and adapt them to the clients that we're working with? I wish I had an answer that would work in every situation but there is no such thing. And as a gay male working with gay men with awareness of the gay male community, it's still a difficult one to answer. But what I can say is if you're working with gay men and you're challenging the community too much based on your own perspectives, they're gonna be out of there because they're not gonna believe that you understand what they're dealing with. Yet, at the same time, you have your own belief system about the depth of relationships and what creates success and what makes success. Another thing is what is your comfort level in discussing sex with your clients. You'll be talking about that more, but I think about that a lot in working with my gay male clients how it's taken me years of developing my own comfort. And if you don't ask they are not going to tell you. So there's a lot of work to be done with that. And the other thing is that our clients size us up from the moment they call us, from the moment they walk into our offices. And for those of you that are not gay, you're going to be tested. Does he understand me? Does she appreciate me? Can I talk about sex? Can I talk about the nuances of open relationships? And will she be or he be okay with that? And that's… that's a tall order. And the last thing that I wanted to say is that the norms of the gay male community and the non-gay community are very different. These are the boundaries, the gay male community is very sexual and open in its sexual energy. And sometimes that's a good thing sometimes it isn't a good thing. I frequently joke that more straight men wish they had the privileges that gay men had regarding sex 'cause the boy would they have fun. And ironically, men are men. So straight men and gay men have a lot more common in sex than men do with women, that's the irony here. So I'm gonna talk about rigid boundaries and I… I was thinking about my gay clients who look at the norms of the heterosexual subculture and think that those boundaries are way too rigid for them. And so when your gay male clients come into your office they may assume that that is your viewpoint. And in my experience many gay men are too free with their boundaries and don't pay attention to what's healthy for them. They just go along with the external boundaries of the community rather than being attentive to what's best. As I do a lot of somatic work with my gay male clients, we shift the focus from external to internal and it's pretty amazing the work that takes place to be able to ascertain within oneself, what works for me? What are my boundaries? What do I need? What helps me feel safe? And frequently, when I'm working with people with out of control sexual behavior, doing this is a wonderful, wonderful tool because I used to get caught in the trap of labeling people and telling them what they needed to do. As you can imagine that didn't work too well. 

00:07:50
HOST No, now you tell me. 

00:07:55
RICK MILLER I don't know where I was on rigid boundaries 'cause I'm not talking about that at all but I'm on a roll here. Another question, what is cheating? What is considered cheating in the gay male community? Two years ago, I was speaking at a Harvard couple's conference and the question came up in the large audience. If you're naked with someone in a hot tub, this was for heterosexuals, does that count as cheating. And the heads were nodding yes in the audience and I'm thinking for gay men, absolutely not, totally not. So a couple questions to think about for your own clarification, is using pornography privately okay? 'Cause that's a norm for many gay men. What about keeping in touch with exes on social media sites or otherwise. Striking up friendships on social media and making new friends and not telling your partner about it, chatting online, or even flirting with people knowing that it's not gonna go anywhere, but putting those innuendos out there. Those are norms in the heterosexual community that may not necessarily be comfortable but might be okay in the gay community. Now I'm not endorsing it saying it should be okay or it isn't okay, I'm just saying people are coming into your offices thinking that this is how it is. I don't know what time it is or what time we started I think I'm halfway there speaking of no boundaries. Speaking of boundaries and timing, how many of people run over their sessions. Only one hand… two hands… three hands. I've made a practice not to, and I've learned that there's a safety that comes from adhering to boundaries for what it's worth. 

00:09:40
HOST You know, what's interesting? I thought you were keeping track of the time. 

00:09:45
RICK MILLER Well, I did, but I didn't… I didn't really remember when I started. So that's a permeable… permeable boundary. Okay, onto permeable boundaries, open relationships are considered the norm in gay male couples. Now I'm not saying it is the norm or it should be, but many clients will come into your office saying I'm gay that means I get to have an open relationship, or my relationship is in crisis, we need to open it up. About 80% of my gay clients that are in crisis do tell me that they think they need to open up their relationship to make their problems better. How helpful is that? I always urge my clients to consider the ramifications of what it means. I frequently tell my clients that I'm not against open relationships and I've worked with many men that have had open relationships. But I'm a real stickler when it comes to the timing of open relationships and I go through a little spiel, some of which I'll go through right now and I also have it in my books about tips for opening up relationships. For example, your relationship comes first. If you're gonna open up your relationship it doesn't give you free rein to not be home. Communication is essential. So other than the issue of deciding is this the right time, there are a lot of decisions to be made between partners about what's okay, what isn't okay, do we have a policy where we talk about it or don't talk about it, do we hook up once with strangers, can it be more than once, can it be friends, is it when we're out of town on business trips, or when you're out of town on business trips, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Many things to consider. What I always say is that think of it as a trial period. And I asked people to think about a period of time that will work as a trial period. Now some people might say three years, think that's a little bit long, maybe 60 days or 90 days to evaluate how it's working, and also for those that are in therapy to talk about it regularly, and have it be the content of couples therapy because it stirs a lot up. A couple things to think about are that opening up a relationship will mean a change in sexual functioning between a couple. Frequently, there's an energy that's shifting away again internal and external. And unless you are the Energizer Bunny, there's probably so much energy physically but also emotionally, so the couple is going through a pretty significant transition. And this is something to think about, I just got lost, I was gonna say one more very important thing about opening up relationships. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN You still… you still have that minute and a half left. You're doing great, Rick. You're doing great. 

00:12:55
RICK MILLER Okay, I know what it was. Expect difficulties. There's no such thing as opening up a relationship and having it be 100% smooth. Jealousy, envy, inadequacy are common, normal human reactions. And that is part of what happens in our role, as a couples therapist is to be able to decipher the complexity of these feelings with our clients. Should they decide to embark on this? Also, if you don't give them permission to do it, it doesn't mean they're not gonna do it. They're gonna do it and not tell you. And I've had many clients come to me and I can, at this point, tell when they're about to say it in their certain stutter, and body language, and tone, what they've begun to embark on. So get yourself comfortable and well versed in for… for gay men, what works and what doesn't work, and get some consultation, supervision, contact me, speak to other gay men, whatever it is that works for you. Let's see, transparency is something we've been talking a lot about in the last few days. And of course, a healthy relationship involves being transparent. Difficulties in male couples are regarding the issue of vulnerability. Men are men not just with sex, we don't know how to communicate. We weren't taught to be good communicators. We're taught not to reveal feelings and talk about our vulnerabilities. So in any relationship issue between gay men, getting at vulnerability and expressing vulnerability is… should be your number one treatment choice. So that's what I call transparency. And then of course, the issue of sharing sexual details and fantasies, and previous experiences before meeting their partners is a really, really healthy thing. That's something that many gay men are comfortable with, but then you'll get people that come into your office that won't talk. And it's our job to kind of pull, pull it and tease it, and get them to talk about it more so that their relationship feels more fluid and more comfortable. When you do that your job will be successful. So that is my 10-minute spiel on boundaries in gay male relationships. 

00:15:15
HOST Thank God, Rick. You did… It was terrific man. Listen… 

00:15:20
RICK MILLER I went over by one minute. 

00:15:25
HOST I… I just want to say though that all the talking points that have to be discussed. When you discuss boundaries, they often reflect values. 

00:15:30
RICK MILLER Good point. 

00:15:35
HOST And values are notoriously difficult to negotiate with. 

00:15:35
RICK MILLER Yes, yes. 

00:15:40
HOST So it's not just the logistics. 

00:15:40
RICK MILLER Yeah. 

00:15:40
HOST And that's what makes it ever more complex. 

00:15:40
RICK MILLER Good point. 

00:15:40
HOST So great… 

00:15:45
RICK MILLER Values for them, values for ourselves. 

00:15:45
HOST Totally, totally. 

00:15:45
RICK MILLER Yeah. 

00:15:50
HOST So the second person on our panel will be… 

00:15:50
MARTHA KAUPPI Martha Kauppi. 

00:15:55
HOST Martha, welcome aboard. 

00:15:55
MARTHA KAUPPI How's the sound? Oh, good. I thought I wasn't gonna disagree with anything you said until you said, what was it you said about, there's no such thing as opening your relationship with out it being stressful or without expecting that it might not be easy. I just want to reframe that too. With all due respect, there's no such thing as being in a relationship at all and expecting it to go easily. So I'm just sayin'. 

00:16:30
RICK MILLER Can't disagree with that. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. Oh, yes, our first… our first disagreement. Thank you, Martha, that's terrific. 

00:16:40
MARTHA KAUPPI Yeah. You know, I've been talking to Rick a lot in the last couple of days and I… I just feel I love him, he's great. And every time we disagree about something, it's partly 'cause we have a different cultural perspective. And then we see, "Oh, yeah, it's just a different cultural perspective." So I actually don't work with very many gay men about their open relationships, I work with a lot of other people though. So I just… I wanna start talking about boundaries because I'm a sex therapist and I talk to an awful lot of people about sex and sexuality including training therapists about it. And you can't talk about sex without talking about consent. And even though there's been a whole big media splash for the last few years about consent, shockingly few people understand consent and even people who should understand consent. So when I talk about consent, I'm talking about the ability to say yes, no, and maybe. I'm talking about the ability to say not any more, or not right this minute. Those are all boundaries and in a healthy sexual interaction, you have to be able to set them, keep them, and withdraw them. And as a sexual partner to somebody who's making a boundary, you have to have an idea that a boundary is a thing that rolls over time, consent rolls. So just saying would you like to have sex? Yes and then considering that to be a done deal for whatever unfolds after that is ridiculous, and it doesn't qualify for consent in my book. So to me, you wanna be able to say, I want this, I don't want this anymore, I want this other thing instead, I want to go back to what we were doing before, and I want other partner to be saying, do you like this, do you still like this, or are you wanting this, where… what… how would I do this in a way that makes you more comfortable, or happier, or feels better. That's a rolling concern, and it's a collaborative process between partners. It's not just something one person does and it doesn't last longer than a moment. So now, the reason I'm talking about consent on a boundaries panel is as a therapist when you think about what would be required from your client in order for them to be able to consent in the way that I'm talking about sophisticated, ongoing, collaborative discussion. Well, they're gonna be it a needing some boundaries. So you really can't talk about consent without talking about boundaries. And so if you're working with a couple about a sex issue and you haven't discussed consent specifically and you begin to you're gonna very quickly find out something about differentiation of self, a person's ability to set a boundary and change a boundary, as circumstances unfold. And when we put this specifically in a sexual interaction things get like a thousand times more complicated because there are all these feelings and expectations and I might lose this relationship, and if this is like a first sexual interaction with somebody, "Oh my God, I don't want to really be seen as troublesome, or problematic, or needy, or withdrawing, or any of those things. We're trying to please our partners when we're having sex oftentimes more than we are at any other time. So somebody might be very good at boundaries in every other's fear and completely collapse in a sexual interaction when it comes to consent. So that's my first thought if you can call that one thought. And my second one is about open relationships, because that's what I'm giving a talk about in a little while. So I work with lots of people and in… in polyamorous relationships specifically, but also other kinds of open relationships. And… so in a polyamorous relationship, my definition for that is an open style where one some or all partners are free to engage in other relationships that involve not just sex but also romance and loving feelings, given that there is consent among everybody involved. Well, so there's that boundary thing again, right? And so now, we're talking about a complicated relations structure where lots of feelings are coming up as they would in a monogamous relationship. And people have to manage that all. And there's a whole lot of complicated and sophisticated communication that has to go on about everything, not just about sex. So I think of an open relationship or a polyamorous relationship as being an invitation for growth in terms of differentiation of self and the ability to build more nuanced ability to consent and have boundaries. So I'm sure that's not 10 minutes, but those are my thoughts. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN Oh, Martha, terrific. Wow, thank you. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN You did that… You did that really, really well. 

00:21:45
MARTHA KAUPPI Oh, thank you, so quickly. 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Janina. 

00:21:50
JANINA FISHER It's so quickly. Oh, can you all hear me? Is this working? Yeah. You know, as… as I'm listening to the two of you, I keep… I keep writing little notes that say, "It's all in the body." right. So what norms we're comfortable with are in our bodies. That's why it's hard if we're… if we're uncomfortable with the norm in the gay community of open relationships. And a failure to embrace monogamy or choice not to embrace it monogamy, right. Our bodies may feel uncomfortable when our gay male clients are talking about their relationships. Same with polyamorous clients, we may be uncomfortable as are our polyamorous client is talking about Joanne on Friday, and Pete on Thursday, and… and her husband on Wednesday. And… And so we have boundaries that are getting triggered in our relationships with clients. And… and just as their boundaries get triggered or don't get triggered in their relationships. And I think it's very, very important for us to be aware that when we feel uncomfortable, client says something and we feel a tensing, you know, when I can tell the boundary muscles go across your midriff and down your sides. So you're listening to a client and you feel this tension in your midriff, listen to it. Because what it means is that something is feeling uncomfortable in the boundary areas of your body. And… and my perspective on boundaries is that they start in the body. The feeling of having comfortable boundaries, being at ease with saying yes, being at ease with saying no, being at ease with saying maybe starts in the body, you know, if we have time we could… I could do an exercise with you, but to try it on your own sometime, or try it with a client, that's the fun part. You asked the client to notice what happens when he or she says no. Does it feel good? You know, so sometimes I just ask, "Does that feel good or bad?" "Does that feel pleasurable or unpleasurable." Because sometimes people can't describe what is happening in their bodies. But if they can say, it feels good, or it feels bad, or it feels better, or if it feels worse, they're in touch with their bodies, right. That's how you know whether you like something is your body says, "Mmm… Yeah, I like that." or "Oh, not so much." And the boundary styles we have of course, are reflective of what we learned as an adaptation in our early attachment relationships. So you can feel rigid boundaries in your body and you can feel a sense of being permeable, or… or diffuse in boundary style. And often that's what couples in part are fighting about. You know, when couples have the classic fight, you know, we have to talk about this, and then the other person shuts down, or can't right. That's really a boundary fight because the person with more permeable boundaries has to talk about it, right. And the person with more rigid, or weak, in sensory motors, I get there where we call it being over or under bounded, right. If you're over bounded because that's the only way you feel safe, your response is gonna be, "I'm not ready to talk about it." right. I… I discuss with myself first. I once had a fourth of July barbecue when I was first starting to think about the way in which these boundary styles conflicted in couple relationships and you know, it must have been something about the fourth of July or the wine that was flowing, but suddenly I said, "Okay, everybody, those of you who have to talk about it go to this end of the yard, and those of you who need to process it internally, go to this side of the yard." And all the couples neatly split in half and over here, those who have to talk about it were saying, "How do they expect that anything's ever gonna get resolved if we don't talk? How we gonna process things? And over here, this group is saying, "Why do you have to talk about everything, like you know, why can't you have a conversation with yourself, get it straightened out," right and then come back and talk." And I… and I could listen to both sets of conversations and think, you know, they're both right. Because… because the… the… I won't call them clients because we're, you know, we're them and they're us, right. Those of us with more permeable boundaries have to talk about it. We can't contain the feelings. We've got to be able to talk about it. And those with who are over bounded because that again, permeable boundaries doesn't mean you're better, it means you grew up in an environment where adaptation meant keeping your boundaries permeable. If only to pick up what was going on, how you needed to behave, what your mother needed, what your father needed, permeable boundaries are good for that. Or maybe you grew up in an environment where you needed to be over boundaried, so that you had a buffer, so that you had a way to protect yourself, and… and so all of those fights are really fights about boundaries. And… and I've loved would, I know I'm supposed to disagree, but I loved what Rick said about… about helping people to notice when their bodies are saying not comfortable, don't like this. And what I love to do is to help people set boundaries using their bodies. Because, I don't know, if you all had this experience but I've spent what feels like years as a therapist trying to rehearse with people how they're gonna say no. Whoops, it's funny, I still am having this relationship probably with my microphone. 

00:29:40
RICK MILLER For your microphone, your hands can be boundary. 

00:29:40
JANINA FISHER We've been fighting, I know, we've been… That's right, I'm violating its boundaries, you are so right. That's right, okay, good. I respect your boundaries, do you respect… But the problem is I need it to respect my need to gesture, which it's having trouble doing too. So when… If we're gonna say meaningful no, it has to come from the gut, right. So I don't want to just talk about how, you know, did you ever do the what we used to do 20 years ago. We'd have people write out the script of how they were gonna set the boundary and then read the script to the partner or memorized the script, and why that didn't work? I came to realize it's because their bodies weren't in it. So now, I wanna help people to notice the feelings, note is there a sense of an energetic boundary or space around the individual. Or is there a sense that anyone could come in, and there's no… there's no buffer. Is your client somebody who feels violated if someone has a different opinion, right, which is a huge problem for many clients with permeable boundaries because your opinion goes right to the heart. There's no boundary to say, "Okay, that's your opinion, I have my opinion." So… so that's something that I can help clients work on, imagine, you know, imagine your mate, here I… I say look around the office find an object to represent your mate and we might work with a gesture that helps create a sense of boundary. What happens as you look at your mate and you set your boundary or you look at your mate and you make a boundary with one hand and you reach out with the other, right. all of… This is good for those who are over bounded because you're not taking away the boundary, right. You're simply giving them a boundary and a way to connect. 

00:32:20
HOST Janina, Janina, you still have a whole minute left. 

00:32:20
JANINA FISHER Oh my God, what am I gonna say. And the other thing, thank you, I just remember. The other thing boundaries do is they help us to contain our feelings so that when, when we speak, when we're… when we say something, we're not just letting somebody have it. We're… we're actually containing enough of what we're feeling to communicate to someone in a way they can hear. And that's fun to work on with people. In sensory motor, we work on helping people with a container gesture, right. So this might be the gesture that you know, so make a container big enough to hold all of your feelings and then we… we will help them notice the feelings settling and then you could help someone notice the sense of boundary. I have these feelings, I can still feel them, but they're not taking over my body, and my voice, and I'm not just throwing up on my mate, I'm actually having a conversation. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Janina, you did that really well with the last minute, thank you. 

00:33:45
JANINA FISHER Oh my God. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN And now the fun part for you guys to talk between amongst yourself about ideas you had when somebody else was talking, sparked an idea, sparked in agreement, sparked here's where we differ, so we'll do that for a few more minutes. Go ahead. 

00:34:05
RICK MILLER I have a thought. 

00:34:05
JANINA FISHER Good. 

00:34:05
MARTHA KAUPPI Well done, glad you are gonna ask. 

00:34:10
RICK MILLER Janine mentioned when your body says no when you don't listen and I'm thinking about the number of clients we've all worked with that don't even know what their bodies say. And frequently, they will come into our offices for guidance, for something external, or perhaps for something internal, but they're using us as the external guide, when in fact, what we can do is help people to go internal. And I do clinical hypnosis and when I do hypnosis with people it's very common that for the very first time in a long time people feel a sense of calm, feel a sense of relief and a huge sense of gratitude that I could bring them or leave them even though it's them doing it themselves to a place inside that they had no idea that they had access to, it feels so magical to them. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
JANINA FISHER Do you want to respond to that or do you want me to. Umm… then I'll do, other than to say you know, contrary to the popular view of hypnosis, in… in a hypnotic state you actually feel energetically boundaried, you don't feel you're under the control of the hypnotherapists, which is part of why it's so powerful. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:35
MARTHA KAUPPI I was struck by the body thing too when you were talking because there is a way of having a sexual issue that has to do with an aversion. And that is, that is a body response that keeps you safe and that's when somebody suggests or does something with you that just makes you go, you know, and people have that, and they have it I think because they didn't recognize the early sign you know, they didn't recognize the early sign and have a sufficient level of differentiation to say, "No, thank you. I think I would prefer to do this thing instead." And then a few years goes by and you touch my shoulder and I'm, "Don't touch me" you know. And then it's hard to unravel from that point. So I think that both of you are exactly right that if you're not taught to honor what's going on in your body and then express it verbally, which is not as easy as it sounds, it really does set you up for all kinds of problems. 

00:36:35
JANINA FISHER Right, it actually… You are a perfect person to try out my hypothesis because… because you'll… you'll know. You know, my hypothesis has been you know, 'cause I'm thinking about trauma and sexuality. That what happens when we're in the midst of making love is that we lose our sense of time and place, and boundary. And that's part of what's pleasurable about sex, but it's also part of what's triggering. And so my… my… the work that I've done with… with couples where trauma is an issue for one or both has been around having the individual noticed the point at which they get triggered, much as you were saying and then pausing, and this takes tremendous collaboration, and then pausing to notice who they're with because at the moment that they're triggered, they're often remembering someone else, and touching them inappropriately, or getting up… Their bodies are getting aroused against their will, right. So there's a certain point of arousal when suddenly it feels unsafe because they've lost the sense of here and now. And so at that moment I… I help them switch to who are we, where are we, right. This is Mary and Jim and we're in our bedroom where it's safe and it's 2017. The tricky part is maintaining the arousal enough to… to be able to be sexual while reorienting to the present. But you know, truthfully, I'd rather that they totally lose the arousal and that the survivor feels safe and want to do it again, right. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN So partly, are you guys suggesting that wouldn't we try to set boundaries with other people that perhaps the first step is the negotiation with ourselves. Do I even have the right to set a boundary? And if I get what I want, that could also scare the hell out of me. If I want and I fail, now what? So it sounds like much of what you're saying starts with an internal negotiation with yourself, not just with the other person. 

00:39:20
JANINA FISHER I think we'd all agree on that. 

00:39:20
MARTHA KAUPPI I agree too, yeah. 

00:39:25
RICK MILLER I'm also thinking about impart… Is that your hand or was that my mouth. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN This is what happens when we lose our editing function. 

00:39:50
RICK MILLER This is horrible. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN You know, and we don't have a boundary around editing and every therapist puts a boundary moment to moment when we have clients in front of us, what we want to say, and what we do say. 

00:40:05
RICK MILLER That's a good point. 

00:40:05
HOST Now Rick on the other hand doesn't struggle with that. 

00:40:10
RICK MILLER Not a problem, well, I lost my moment. But I was gonna talk about partners who are so attuned to their partners during sexual and intimate moments that they're feeling the dissociation in their partner's body themselves when their partner isn't feeling it and how complicated that is and what they do with that, and how we decipher those struggles in our offices. 

00:40:40
MARTHA KAUPPI That's exactly what I was thinking. I was thinking my microphone is coming and going. I was thinking it's not just the survivor that benefits from that, it's also the sex partner of survivor because it's a devastating experience to feel like an abuser. 

00:40:55
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:40:55
MARTHA KAUPPI When you're in an intimate interaction trying to tune in and that's not just destructive for one partner, it's hugely destructive for the other. So there's a responsibility I think to be able to set a boundary so that your partner can trust you so that your partner can trust you dont move forward. So the boundary isn't a selfish thing at all, it's a gift. Because for instance, if I know that I'll say no, I will be able to ask you a favor. If I don't trust you to say no, I won't be able to lean in at all. 

00:41:30
JANINA FISHER Yeah. I have to say I love the concept of rolling consent. And I was thinking about how… how hard that is to do because it means for rolling consent, you have to be in touch with yourself enough to know "Oh, I like that a minute ago, but I… This is so great." And then to be able to verbalize it. And that something that you have to really teach couples how to do and also teach the other partner, well, both partners how to tolerate it. 

00:42:10
MARTHA KAUPPI Yeah, pretty much the backbone of almost every single treatment plan for a sex issue I think is what I would call the linear versus circular model of sex. So the circular model of sex is one where you can up shift and downshift and choose from a smorgasbord of things without some sort of operational goal like orgasm as an end point and a marker of success but rather the marker of success being maintaining connection with your partner regardless of what activities you do and regardless of whether it goes according to plan. So when your partner, for instance, loses their erection, to continue with the connection and stop worrying about the penis and vagina penetration and that's how we attend to the closeness of the sexual interaction, which includes obviously being responsive to dissociation. We have to tune into each other, be respectful of each other's body language boundaries and any kind of shift so that either just kinetically naturally we move through a sexual interaction in a connected way or we have to actually think about it and make it happen, sounds so simple. And when I say backbone of treatment plan, I mean a year or three I mean, this can be a really complicated project because it's the differentiation of self project and that everybody can do that quite yet. 

00:43:35
JANINA FISHER Absolutely, and if one has permeable boundaries, it may be a huge individual project just to develop more boundary, right. 

00:43:50
MARTHA KAUPPI Yeah. 

00:43:50
JANINA FISHER And if one has rigid boundaries, a huge individual project, to you know, we have a wonderful word in sensory motor psychotherapy, we talk about relaxing a pattern, which is not as scary a word that was actually the one place where I was… I was not disagreeing with you, but thinking about the complications of it. You know that word "Vulnerability" is a very frightening word for certainly, for males in our culture but also for lots and lots of females too, right. Maybe not frightening because women are not supposed to cry because our culture allows women to cry, but because it wasn't safe in our early environments and how… You know, that… this is about the I think, probably the dance of the therapist boundary with the clients boundaries like how do we help people approach vulnerability when vulnerability is terrifying whether it's connected to shame? And again, I think of Sue Johnson and her concept of titrating risk, right. How do we help someone be just a little tiny bit vulnerable, right. Just a tad, I noticed in a lot of Sue's tapes, the vulnerability is around saying you know, I can't talk about that yet, with, right, which is actually to a lot of vulnerability for some people. And… And how… how do we, whether it's a gay, straight, polyamorous, how do we help people befriend their vulnerability is to me a big question. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Do you guys are you ready for some questions from the audience? 

00:45:55
RICK MILLER Yes. 

00:45:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:46:00
HOST Do we have people who are microphone runners? We do, and the microphone runners are… We have one right over there. Is there another one, and another one over here, so if you have a question raise your hand and a microphone will magically appear. If you don't, oh, wait a minute. Yes, we have one there and one there. Thank you. Go ahead please. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN I have a question for Janin… Janina, what I was wondering about was an exercise that I do with couples when we're trying to set limits on conflict and really just maybe some ideas that you might have to make that more of a… of a sensory experience for that to deepen it rather than it just being an intellectual exercise. 

00:46:55
JANINA FISHER What are some of the rules you give them? What was kind of you know, I love the idea of teaching couples to fight fairly and to fight well. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. It's really something that they come up with themselves. They reflect on what is it okay for me to do when we're disagreeing? What is it not okay for me to do it we disagreeing, and likewise partner, what is it okay for… you know, what is it okay for you to do when we're disagreeing and not. So it's very much something, it's collaborative, well, it's individual first of all and they are thinking it through, but then they share what's okay and they get to talk about it and agree or disagree. And… But I find it a very heady exercise. And I'm just wondering something to bring it more into the body to slow it down or deepen it. 

00:47:40
JANINA FISHER Right, right, right. So you know, one of my favorite ways of getting into the body without scaring people, this is my… my quest is to find ways to help people embrace their vulnerability, there's emotions in their bodies without scaring themselves off to death. So… so I might, you know, sometimes I help couples, I do a little psycho education about how you can't feel close to someone unless you both feel safe in the body. And… and if… and if your body doesn't feel safe or your partner's half body doesn't feel safe, the two of you can't feel close. So you know I might frame some of those rules as… as about establishing a feeling of safety. So we could go through them having the you know, the partner that wants the rule about don't yell at me saying, "When you yell at me, here's what happens to me." And you know, "Don't criticize me." What happens in the body when you're criticized, because usually what happens is something the partner doesn't really want, right. Because the partner that's so critical doesn't really want you know, her spouse or partner to feel this big. 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN See, Janina, Janina, it's kind of interesting, almost you could say when somebody makes a request "Don't criticize me" What do you feel when you express the desire not to be criticized? And what does the partner feel when they hear the request not to do the criticizing so you can keep checking in with the body with each separate request? 

00:49:50
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. And my… my favorite sensory motor question is how can you tell you don't like this, right? What's telling you, you don't like this? What… what happens to you when you're criticized? How can you tell… 

00:50:05
HOST It's an ongoing checking out as it goes back and forth. 

00:50:10
JANINA FISHER With the rolling consent, right. It kind of all flows into one. 

00:50:15
HOST And someone else had a question back here, go ahead. In the back, oh, right here we have, go ahead. 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN Actually, I have a comment and a question associated with exactly what you're talking about. Self soothing, centering I mean, for myself and sometimes for my clients, I learned in yoga, put the tongue against the roof of the mouth, breathe, center, connect with the feet to the earth to minimize your mission… reactivity, because there's an overwhelm. You might have some other techniques you sometimes have a client place a hand on the heart. So any comments about that I appreciate it. 

00:51:00
HOST So Martha, Martha, Rick, anything you would say when you are negotiating these kind of boundaries. 

00:51:05
MARTHA KAUPPI Well, I would say that what… When we're talking about staying in your body and reading your body and your responses, then if we talk about that in a sexual interaction, we're basically describing embodied sex… sex and sexual interactions and a deep connection with your partner that's based in reality rather than some sort of fantasy. So I wish that were easy. I wish that were easy, but it's a great thing to teach therapeutically and those kind of mindfulness techniques that you're talking about are very helpful. You can call regulate beautifully when you're really close with bodily close to somebody that you trust even if you really get thrown off center, maybe they can help you stay as long as you don't feel trespassed upon. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Rick is there anything you want to add to that? 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN Ready for the next question? 

00:52:00
RICK MILLER Yeah, I'm ready. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN All right. And someone else had their hand up. Oh, over here. 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN We're gonna get you, this guy's actually… 

00:52:10
RICK MILLER Oh, he's been tenacious so… 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN I have to call on somebody who is standing up with the microphone she looks kind of familiar… 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN Is this on? Okay. Now I was interested in two quick things one, Martha, if you would talk a little bit more about navigating consent in a polyamorous relationship and then also if the rolling consent plays into that in some way. 

00:52:35
MARTHA KAUPPI That's a really good question. Yes it does. You know from moment to moment what we prefer shifts. And oftentimes we have a theory about how we're gonna respond in a particular situation so we sign up for the experiment and that's how we find out what we want and don't prefer. And that's when we need to show up with some sort of an honest statement about change. And that continually happens in a sexual interaction, continually happens in a monogamous relationship, and happens all the time in a polyamorous relationship because there are so many moving parts. The more people there are involved the more little separate organisms are involved, that's a lot of ecosystems to manage. And a lot of differing levels of differentiation itself, a lot of differing understandings of relationships and differing agreements. So absolutely, it's crucial to be able to tune into what… where you are, where you are hoping to get to, how stuck you are there, who is there with you and feel free to renegotiate everything in a very fluid way, all of the time. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN This questions for the panel. What is it about sexuality that it has such a profound impact on the human psyche? 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN Hey and listen, while you are at it will you give, will you respond to the meaning of life? And give an example. 

00:54:10
[sil.] 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN I was gonna say its fun, pleasurable. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN What is enormous question. Thank you for stumping the panel, I really appreciate it. We got a question here that stump three experts with one question, way to go. 

00:54:40
MARTHA KAUPPI Oh, it does us really deeply because we're letting somebody and much closer than we normally would feel comfortable, so there's the potential there for the deepest kind of intimacy because you are sort of emerging organisms, sort of literally. And I think that it's just so moving for people to do that and then you stern a little pleasure, which makes it so you want to do it again. And things start to get even better. 

00:55:15
JANINA FISHER And you know, it's interesting. Because as I was pondering as I could see you guys, you know, we're all kind of like "Oh my God" deer in the headlights with that question. You know, I was thinking part of it may be also the versatility of sex because among traumatized individuals, often sex feels safer than attachment. It's a way of being connected to somebody without exposing too much vulnerability, without getting emotionally intimate and sex gives us think that gamut, right. It can deepen and emotionally intimate relationship and it can spare us from having to attach deeply while still giving us that experience of connection. So that it has… it has to be in part that it can be so many things, right. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Okay, last question. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Okay, this is for Rick. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on how I might be tested as a therapist when a gay couple comes in and even though I think I'm pretty open and so on. How do… how might I step in it and not know the next step in it 

00:56:40
HOST Oh, really good question. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN If you could, if you could elaborate it little bit more. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN Oh, really good question, yeah. 

00:56:50
RICK MILLER I appreciate your asking it. Micro aggressions happen all the time for any minority group. And frequently, if we're speaking to someone and we take the liberty to say things comfortably thinking that whether it be humorous or that they will understand, that may not be the case. I am all about the bond in the psychotherapy relationship and when gay men work with a non-gay therapist there is a profound sense of healing that takes place on a much earlier level. And so making deep heartfelt communication as opposed to trying to win them over would be my very quick answer to you. Frequently, when therapists try to convince their clients that they understand or I've worked with a lot of other gay men, sometimes that can feel off putting to clients, when in fact, the way in which you make eye contact, the way in which you can be comforting and accepting to them is bigger than anything else. 

00:57:55
MARTHA KAUPPI (inaudible). 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Thank you, thank you. I would just… I just want to say one thing because we got to keep the boundary around two o'clock, sorry Martha, but in case you didn't notice it, I was doing a series of negotiations with Nate, who is running the PR system. What's this called? 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN PA system. 

00:58:15
HOST PA system back there, Nate and I have never communicated. He would turn this off, I would signal to Nate I'm about ready to speak, we set up a communication negotiation process in front of you. Nate, I appreciate your picking up on the subtle cues really, really fast, when they shut me down and turn me on. Thank you, Nate. And I just want to have one final appreciation for our panelists. Rick Miller, Martha Kauppi, and Janina Fisher, yes.
