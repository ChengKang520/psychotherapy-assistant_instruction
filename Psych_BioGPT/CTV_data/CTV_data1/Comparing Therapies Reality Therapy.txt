Comparing Therapies Using a Simulated Client William Glasser, M.D. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Marie. 

00:01:00
MARIE Yes. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM GLASSER The person that's role playing with me is one of the attendees at this conference. And she's a counselor and therapist, and she's going to portray, excuse me, she's going to portray a man whom she works with. I don't know anything about the man, all I know is what I just told you. Okay, go ahead- 

00:01:25
MARIE Yes. 

00:01:25
WILLIAM GLASSER -Marie, you want to, uh, just play him, and I'll start out as if you're the man, tell me the man's name. 

00:01:30
MARIE My name is Paul. 

00:01:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, Paul, well, uh, you came here, to see me today, and I just don't want to put any, you know, words in your mouth, just tell me the story, whatever it is. 

00:01:45
MARIE Well, the story is that, um, I suffered um, a career change when I wasn't expecting, and it put a lot of pressure on my marriage, and I seemed to uh, be repeating the same pattern that I did in my first marriage, and it makes me, um, very unhappy, because I'm now doing the same thing a second time. 

00:02:05
WILLIAM GLASSER So, the problem is your marriage, is what you're saying, how long you been married with your second marriage? 

00:02:10
MARIE Uh, five years. 

00:02:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Five years, and, excuse me, and were you uh, happy at first? 

00:02:20
MARIE Yes. 

00:02:20
WILLIAM GLASSER And then you're saying your career changed, and you started withdrawing from your wife? 

00:02:25
MARIE Uh, yes, I guess I withdraw, I don't mean to, but I, I have a hard time staying focused when I'm home. All my energy's going into my new, uh, venture. 

00:02:40
WILLIAM GLASSER And is this new venture succeeding? 

00:02:40
MARIE Uh, as far as I can see, it is. 

00:02:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And so, how does your wife deal with this? 

00:02:50
MARIE Um, I guess you would say that she nags me to pay attention. 

00:02:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Mmhmm, she's starting to nag a little bit, so. Okay and when she nags, what do you do? 

00:03:00
MARIE Um, I just tell her I'm doing the best I can and I think I am, but I know I'm not. 

00:03:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Does her nagging, in a certain sense, uh, do you choose to withdraw after she nags even more? Or do you come close for a while, and then withdraw, how do you handle it? 

00:03:20
MARIE Well she says I just withdraw. 

00:03:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Mmhmm. Okay, so, you agree with her, is that right? 

00:03:25
MARIE Yes, but if, if she presents it in a um, argumentative way, I just get defensive and argumentative. 

00:03:35
WILLIAM GLASSER So you also argue and defend yourself, she's critical of you a little bit too. 

00:03:40
MARIE Well she's critical about my not paying attention. 

00:03:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Does she know you're coming to see me? 

00:03:45
MARIE Yes. 

00:03:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Is this something that is okay with her? 

00:03:50
MARIE Definitely. 

00:03:50
WILLIAM GLASSER She thinks you need the help then, huh? 

00:03:50
MARIE Yes. 

00:03:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. And have you ever said to her well, you oughta get some help? 

00:04:00
MARIE Uh, yes, she'll come when we think it's okay. 

00:04:00
WILLIAM GLASSER So if I wanted to see her along with you, that would be okay with you? 

00:04:05
MARIE Yes. 

00:04:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Now in this situation, where you say you're withdrawing, and I say you're choosing to withdraw, because I believe people literally choose all the things they do. If you're withdrawing, you're aware of it. 

00:04:20
MARIE Yes. 

00:04:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You're walking away from her when maybe you should walk toward her, things like that, is that what you're saying? 

00:04:25
MARIE Yes. 

00:04:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Now, the the thing that I kind of believe and although you may not have uh, thought much about this, but, the only person's behavior that you can control is your own. Obviously you can't control hers, or you'd tell her be happy with you and things like that. 

00:04:45
MARIE Right. 

00:04:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And so, are you right now, and I think you are, but I want you to repeat it, because I wanna make sure, are you dissatisfied with the marriage that it is right now? 

00:04:55
MARIE Yes I am. 

00:05:00
WILLIAM GLASSER You're dissatisfied. And, uh, if you're dissatisfied, is there anything cross your mind that you could choose to do to make the marriage better now? I mean, you're withdrawing, that's certainly it-, is there anything you could choose to make it better right now? 

00:05:15
MARIE Well I wish I could pay more attention, but I'm just consumed with all of the insecurities I have about this new it's totally different than what I did for 25 years- 

00:05:25
WILLIAM GLASSER In other words all this is going through your head in your wife is kind of dropping out of the picture and she's a little bit concerned about that to say the least, huh? 

00:05:35
MARIE Right. 

00:05:35
WILLIAM GLASSER What are some thoughts that are going through your mind, don't tell me all about your business, but just a few thoughts that run through your mind that are consuming you as you say now? 

00:05:45
MARIE Is this the right choice? Uh, why did I have to leave the other job, it was going so good, um, um, am I gonna be able to have enough money to keep the, the business going, um, where am I gonna find the people, I'm having trouble with the people I have now. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM GLASSER So those are the negative thoughts. 

00:06:05
MARIE Yes. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM GLASSER But the positive thoughts as you told me are you think this thing is doing pretty well to some extent. 

00:06:10
MARIE Yes. 

00:06:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, now, when you married your wife, what did you think about your wife as, as a partner, how do you look at a wife, you've been married before, so this is not the first experience you say the other one didn't, was broke up, but this migh-, wife, what's a wife to you? 

00:06:30
MARIE Um, she's uh, first of all my friend and lover and, um, I'd like to do things with her, but not as much as she wants to do. Um- 

00:06:45
WILLIAM GLASSER But you think of her as your friend and partner. 

00:06:50
MARIE Yes. 

00:06:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And, what is friend, I understand that, but what is partner mean exactly? 

00:06:55
MARIE Well, I don't think, uh, like we don't have children in the home, I don't think that, uh, she tells me what to do or I tell her what to do. We're just sort of equal partners. 

00:07:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, you don't tell her what to do, she doesn't tell you what to do, you try to get along as partners do. 

00:07:15
MARIE Right. 

00:07:15
WILLIAM GLASSER And, does your wife work outside of the home? 

00:07:15
MARIE Yes. 

00:07:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, do you have anything much to do with her job? 

00:07:25
MARIE No. 

00:07:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so whatever it is, does she ever talk to you about her job? 

00:07:30
MARIE Um, yes but she works with children and I never had children, so I'm not very interested in it. 

00:07:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Mmhmm. And you knew this when you married her? 

00:07:40
MARIE Yes. 

00:07:40
WILLIAM GLASSER That you weren't very into-, did she accept that you're not very interested in children, is it something she accepted? 

00:07:45
MARIE Well actually, um, I was more interested before I had this major life change. 

00:07:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so, this thing is kind of, as you say, overwhelming you. 

00:08:00
MARIE Yes. 

00:08:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Excuse me, so if you continue the way you are, and you don't change in some way to try to get closer to her, you suspect this marriage is gonna go down the drain too? 

00:08:10
MARIE Well that's what I'm afraid of. 

00:08:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. How much is the marriage worth to you? 

00:08:20
MARIE Well now you sound like my wife. 

00:08:20
WILLIAM GLASSER I couldn't hear you. 

00:08:25
MARIE Now you sound like my wife. 

00:08:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well, that's okay, I don't mind sounding like your wife, she's not here, I can sound like her a little bit. 

00:08:30
MARIE She thinks that I'm paying more-, that my job is more important than she is. 

00:08:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh huh, well that's normal thing, that she'd say in this situation, and you've kinda told me the job is more important. 

00:08:45
MARIE Well, I don't th-, I don't feel that it's more important, I just know that I have to put all my energy into it, because- 

00:08:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Well let's get down to specifics, I mean, uh, are you gone from the home how many hours a day during the five working days? 

00:09:05
MARIE Uh, I work six days, and I'm gone about 10 or 11 hours. 

00:09:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so six days, let's say 12 hours you're gone, 12 hours you're home, six days, what do you do on Sunday? 

00:09:20
MARIE Um, well. Uh, we, in the summer time we do go boating, but I don't, I'm not really as interested in it as I used to be, and we, we used to dance, but, um, I just don't seem to put my feet together anymore. And um, I guess she arranges for social things with our friends, and I participate. 

00:09:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, but, whatever you were doing before, the kind of, the joy has gone out of it for you now, you're all overwhelmed with this other stuff. 

00:09:50
MARIE That, yes- 

00:09:50
WILLIAM GLASSER So, I'm just trying to figure out, just take Sunday, when you actually stay away from work, is that right? 

00:10:00
MARIE Yes. 

00:10:00
WILLIAM GLASSER And on Sunday, what do you do on Sunday, what did you do last Sunday? 

00:10:05
MARIE Uh, well, let's see, I had to do some things around the house, and, uh, then we, we went on a picnic and uh, and in the evening, we went to the movies. 

00:10:20
WILLIAM GLASSER So, you tried to do something that would get you close to your wife, but for some reason, like the picnic, which could have been a good time two or three years ago, it didn't work very well. What did you do on the picnic itself? Do ya, did you talk about anything, or just munch the food down, how'd you handle it? 

00:10:40
MARIE Well, um, I'm not the most social person in our marriage, uh, I, I talk to the people who talk to me, and, and I just hung out until it was over. 

00:10:50
WILLIAM GLASSER But to start a business, you have to be a little bit social. 

00:10:55
MARIE Yes, I know that's different, it seems easy just to talk to customers and employees. And you're not like, it doesn't take so much out of you. 

00:11:10
WILLIAM GLASSER What makes it easier? What about them makes it easier than talking to your wife? 

00:11:15
MARIE Um, well they're strangers, and I just have to please them for a minute. 

00:11:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh huh. 

00:11:25
MARIE I just heard what I said. 

00:11:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, that's okay. You don't have to please them, you say do this do that, check back with me and things like that. 

00:11:30
MARIE Yeah it's all done. 

00:11:30
WILLIAM GLASSER It's all done. And with your wife, it's not all done, huh? 

00:11:35
MARIE No. 

00:11:40
WILLIAM GLASSER So, uh, if she doesn't accept you the way you are, is this gonna be the end of your marriage? 

00:11:45
MARIE Well I hope not, but I don't know- 

00:11:50
WILLIAM GLASSER Well hoping has nothing to do with it, I mean, hoping, hoping is a very weak behavior. 

00:11:55
MARIE Well, I know that it didn't work before. 

00:12:00
WILLIAM GLASSER So you already know how weak it is. You hoped the last time. 

00:12:05
MARIE Yes. For 25 years. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. Does it, does it take any energy or effort on your part to hope? 

00:12:15
MARIE Uh, no. 

00:12:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Hoping is kind of a easy thing to do. 

00:12:20
MARIE Yeah. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. It takes a lot of energy to start this business. 

00:12:25
MARIE A lot. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM GLASSER A lot of thinking and everything else. 

00:12:25
MARIE Worry. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And, are you saying that your brain is such that you really, let's say your wife was like another business. And if the other business failed, both businesses would fail. They're kinda tied together, because in a kind of a sense, they are. 

00:12:50
MARIE I see. 

00:12:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And so, uh, how would you deal with your wife if you thought she was another business, that if that failed, which it could very well harm this enterprise if it does fail, it might cost you money, it might cost you time, it might divert your mind, so there's some kind of advantage to you in kind of I suppose, not falling back into the fact that I'm not very social, I'm overwhelmed, does she buy the fact that you're overwhelmed? She may have bought the fact that you're not that social, maybe, right from the start, but how about the overwhelmed part? 

00:13:30
MARIE Um, no she always asks me if I'm there for 10 hours, what's overwhelming me in the evening. What-, what's going on with me, and I tell her what I told you. 

00:13:45
WILLIAM GLASSER And she doesn't believe it, she doesn't buy into it, huh? 

00:13:50
MARIE Well she says that it-, it's more important to think about the problems than it is to think about having a good time. 

00:13:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, I suppose the problem'll always be there. Uh, do you consider yourself a creative person? 

00:14:05
MARIE In business. 

00:14:05
WILLIAM GLASSER You are creative. 

00:14:05
MARIE Mmhmm. 

00:14:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And your creativity ends in business, you think? 

00:14:10
MARIE Pretty much been that way. 

00:14:15
WILLIAM GLASSER What do you, does the creativity come to mind in business? Does a creative idea ever come to mind at home? Because creativity, creative people, ideas come to them almost any time. 

00:14:30
MARIE Yeah, sometimes they come at home, and I write 'em down. 

00:14:30
WILLIAM GLASSER You write 'em down, huh? 

00:14:35
MARIE Yeah. 

00:14:35
WILLIAM GLASSER But those are business ideas. 

00:14:35
MARIE Right. 

00:14:35
WILLIAM GLASSER I'm thinking about a creative idea toward your wife, has that ever crossed your mind at home? 

00:14:45
MARIE No. 

00:14:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so now we've established a lot of things. If you do and keep doing what you're doing, there's a good chance you can predict the outcome, right? 

00:14:55
MARIE I guess so. 

00:14:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, and you're choosing to do what you're doing, no one's forcing you to do it or not do it. It's not against the law to do something different with y our wife is it? 

00:15:05
MARIE I never thought of that as a choice. 

00:15:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You never thought of it as a choice? 

00:15:10
MARIE No. 

00:15:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Have you ever done anything in your whole life that wasn't chosen? That you can think of? You got married, wasn't that a choice? 

00:15:20
MARIE Yes. 

00:15:20
WILLIAM GLASSER When you kiss your wife isn't it a choice? 

00:15:25
MARIE Yes. 

00:15:25
WILLIAM GLASSER When you don't talk to her, isn't that a choice? You realize you're not talking with her, you don't hear anything. 

00:15:30
MARIE Well that's the part that I can't seem to stay aware of. 

00:15:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh I think you're aware of it, you just figure, well, that's not an important choice. You come to me because of the problem with your marriage, not with your business. I'm not a business advisor. But I have advised a lot of people about marriage. 

00:15:50
MARIE Yes. 

00:15:50
WILLIAM GLASSER And so, if you continue doing what you're doing which isn't working. If in business, something isn't working, do you keep doing it? 

00:16:00
MARIE No. I stop it right away- 

00:16:05
WILLIAM GLASSER You stop it. As quick as you can. 

00:16:05
MARIE Yes. 

00:16:05
WILLIAM GLASSER And in your marriage, you keep doing what you know isn't working, and keep doing it like, you go through the motions of a picnic, but your heart's not in it. You're too, you say, well it's not important. 

00:16:20
MARIE So are you saying that's, I'm making a choice to do that, to be that way? 

00:16:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Oh, well if you're not making a choice to do it, then why would it be happening? Let's say that your business hits big. And in two weeks you have 10 million dollars rolling in, and another million dollars just selling out with a dot com things, or something like that. 

00:16:40
MARIE I'd be happy. 

00:16:40
WILLIAM GLASSER You'd be happy. And you'd probably share your happiness with your wife. 

00:16:45
MARIE Yes. 

00:16:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, so it's a hypothetical thing, it probably isn't going to happen. 

00:16:50
MARIE But that's what I tell her. 

00:16:50
WILLIAM GLASSER What? 

00:16:50
MARIE That it could be big and then we'll be happy. 

00:16:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh huh, but she's not willing to wait for that. 

00:16:55
MARIE Right. 

00:16:55
WILLIAM GLASSER I mean, we're dealing with a person that says more than this, I'm not gonna put up with. So, then, it's a doomed, it's doomed, and I kinda can't help you. But it's hard for me to believe that a creative person, who literally wanted to do something about the marriage, what if you told your wife I wanna work seven days a week instead of six? Think about that. 

00:17:30
MARIE I, I think she'd probably would leave. 

00:17:30
WILLIAM GLASSER She'd leave you. Okay. So, six days you think she can hang in there. That's why you're taking Sunday off, right? 

00:17:40
MARIE Yes. 

00:17:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, that's reasonable, I don't, I don't fault you for doing that, that's fine. But let's say you ran it up to seven. And you told your wife how many days because don't you get antsy at home on Sunday when you think you could be down there fussing around with various things? And here you say I'm sitting in a picnic in the park, what the hell am I doing here? 

00:18:05
MARIE Yeah, yeah that-, that's what I do say. 

00:18:10
WILLIAM GLASSER It happens, doesn't it? And your wife senses that, she's not insensitive to you, she's very sensitive to you. So, let's just say hypothetically, this is very hypothetical. But we have to talk about what might help. Because just a run through with about you oughta do more, she oughta do more, is not gonna work, we gotta get something going here. No, you're gonna work six days a week for about 10 hours a day, and then you're gonna work on Sunday for maybe, go in maybe eight hours on Sunday. Come home, leave about, about eight in the morning, come home about 4 or 5 in the afternoon. Let's just say that's it. Now, you ask your wife, would that be okay with you? What would your wife say? 

00:18:55
MARIE You don't wanna know. She'd say that's it. 

00:19:00
WILLIAM GLASSER She'd say that's it, that's the end of the ballgame. 

00:19:05
MARIE I knew this was, uh, coming, because I always felt that your new business was more important than our marriage. 

00:19:10
WILLIAM GLASSER She'd probably say if it was up to you you'd probably work eight hours a day, right? I mean eight days a week. 

00:19:15
MARIE Eight days a week. 

00:19:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, that's right, but it's not up to you. 

00:19:15
MARIE But I'm not doin' it just for me. 

00:19:20
WILLIAM GLASSER No, you're doing a business, if you're make money, and make, your wife will accrue in the happiness, but you see, that's not what's on her mind right now. What's on her mind is that she had a husband and from her standpoint, I'm putting words into her mouth, but I think they're accurate, from her standpoint she doesn't have a husband anymore. She has a guy that's working hard to produce a lotta money down the line, but also after all this, it might not produce that money-, you don't know. If she would come to you and say, look, you know, work all you want, all the time, how would that, how would you feel if she said that? She said I'm behind ya 100 percent. Work all you want all the time. If I don't see ya for two weeks in a row, I can live with it, because darling, I know you're happy, and all that kind of a thing. 

00:20:15
MARIE I'm supposed to imagine that that's gonna ha- 

00:20:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Imagine as opposed to what you got now. 

00:20:20
MARIE Oh, well I would be, I think that'd help our marriage. 

00:20:25
WILLIAM GLASSER It would help your marriage, even though you'd hardly be married, it would help your marriage. 

00:20:25
MARIE Well she said that if it was her idea. 

00:20:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh huh, okay. But, let's, let's say she doesn't say that, but we're throwing that out as an idea, but that would be good for you. 

00:20:40
MARIE Yeah, it would take the pressure off. 

00:20:40
WILLIAM GLASSER What if your wife said to you or maybe you could say it to your wife. I mean, you could say honey, when I'm with ya, I'm not with ya. I'm worried about the business. Would that be the truth? 

00:20:55
MARIE Yes. 

00:20:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Could you say to her I love ya and I don't wanna lose the marriage? Would that be the truth? 

00:21:00
MARIE Yes. 

00:21:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. Could you say to your wife if I could figure out a way, even though I'm not with you that much, but when I'm with you, I'll really be with you, how much of that time would you need to save this marriage? I'm not saying you could do it, but this is a question you'd be asking your wife, because you could tell her the truth. On Sunday, you really weren't with her. On the night time, sometimes you're watching television, but she's watching and it's your mind is spinning off into various things that are on your mind. And, it's like a cancer eating away at your marriage. Which you can see it happening, that's why you came to see me. And so, I'm wondering if a person like you who's moderately creative, not too social, but you got married twice, you want a woman, you want some help, you want some love. 

00:22:00
MARIE Yes. 

00:22:00
WILLIAM GLASSER All these things which she gave you until this started. And then she was surprised, did you consult her before you went off on this venture? 

00:22:10
MARIE Um, you mean when I went into the business? 

00:22:10
WILLIAM GLASSER This new venture that you're in. 

00:22:15
MARIE Uh, well, not really, I mean I-, I didn't have a job, so I had to do something. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay, but she understood that you were going off into it. 

00:22:25
MARIE Right, yes. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM GLASSER And probably hoped it would work out for the best. But it hasn't. So, but, but it has a chance, you say it's gonna suc-, you say it's gonna su-, you have a think it's gonna succeed. 

00:22:40
MARIE Yeah, I think it will. 

00:22:40
WILLIAM GLASSER So could you tell me, because she's not here, but could you tell me tell me, what you could do to convince me that you're gonna spend some real time with me that's our time, like has making love, has that kind of, slacked off in your marriage? 

00:23:00
MARIE Yeah. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM GLASSER Making love has slacked off. Could you tell her honey, I wanna make love to you, I know you don't feel loving toward me right now, but I wanna have a time every week, once or twice a week, when we make love. She might look at you a askance, but she must have enjoyed making love to you at your age when you get married, you made love before and it was okay, and it was good in the beginning. Making love's a very important part. 

00:23:25
MARIE It is. 

00:23:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Would you be willing to ask her quite-, we're not, we're just-, working on this now. Would you be willing to ask her a question about I wanna set aside at least twice a week when I treat you in a way that I'm with you. And it ends up with us in bed making love. Because I'm relatively young and so are you, and we wouldn't wanna stop this. My being abstinent doesn't help my business. I don't think there's any close correlation between the two. But being abstinent kind of takes your mind off sex, which gives you more time for your business, in your case, it isn't such a serious thing. Because you got your business to fall back on. What has she got to fall back on when you don't make love to her? 

00:24:20
MARIE Nothing. 

00:24:20
WILLIAM GLASSER If she fell back on another man, that wouldn't be that good, would it? 

00:24:25
MARIE No. 

00:24:25
WILLIAM GLASSER She's probably not gonna do that, but I'm just saying her fallback thing is she can't work with the kids day and night. The kids go to sleep. And so uh, what I'm trying to help you, guide you in some way to get you to think about is, that this is a problem that's solvable. But so far you don't wanna solve it. You'd like to solve it, and you hope it gets solved. But you haven't put a great deal of effort if any effort into doing much except you complain a lot to yourself. Do you ever kind of feel a little bit like it's her fault that she's putting this pressure on you and I can't devote so much time to the business? 

00:25:15
MARIE Sometimes. 

00:25:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah. So you end up kind of blaming her, criticizing her a little bit. These are the things that destroy relationships. Let me tell ya. What I call the seven deadly habits that destroy relationships. And see if, with your wife, these will also wreck your business if you use them too much, but they really do destroy relationships because if your business is going to succeed, it needs good relationships there too. You say you can talk to them and they shut up and things like that. But if they talk to you and they're unsatisfied, they won't work as hard. And the key to solv-, starting a successful business is a lotta hard work, but you can't do it all yourself. Other people have to work hard too. So, lemme run through these habits and see if you recognize them. Criticizing, the worst. Do you find yourself criticizing your wife overtly or covertly very much since this trouble has started? 

00:26:15
MARIE Well, um, not much, not much overtly, but yeah I think- 

00:26:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You send the message kind of you should do better than you are and things like that. How about blaming a little bit of blaming? 

00:26:30
MARIE Yeah. 

00:26:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Complaining, do you run through a lotta complaining in your mind? 

00:26:35
MARIE Um, sort of the same thing as, yeah, before. 

00:26:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Mmhmm. Okay, those are the main ones. There's seven of them, but let's stop here with criticizing, blaming, and complaining. Could you in some way talk to your wife and say right now tell her you went to the counselor, cuz you have, tell him-, excuse me, tell her that the counselor focused on criticizing, blaming and complaining, do you have the feeling in the last period of time we've been together that I've been criticizing you, blaming, and complaining about you. Do you get that feeling? You, you're the wife and I'm you now. 

00:27:20
MARIE Yes, I do. 

00:27:20
WILLIAM GLASSER You get that feeling. Then tell her the doctor that I went to says that this is wrecking our marriage. And our marriage can't stand this kinda behavior, would you kind of agree with that? 

00:27:30
MARIE Yes. 

00:27:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay. 

00:27:35
MARIE I'm still her, right? 

00:27:35
WILLIAM GLASSER You're still her. 

00:27:35
MARIE Okay. 

00:27:35
WILLIAM GLASSER Now, you could say to her, I'll say it, I'd like to stop it. I'd like to talk about it, and I'd like to stop it. I can't give you all the attention you want, but when I'm giving you attention, I'd like it to be without criticizing, blaming, and complaining. So, since I wanna do it, would you help me? 

00:28:10
MARIE How can I help you? 

00:28:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Well you could help me by saying, I'm getting the feeling right now that you're not only not with me, but you're blaming criticizing, or complaining, and if you'll say that to me, I'll try to stop. I need the reminder from you, you have to care about me enough to help me through this stage, and I have to care you-, about you enough so I stop doin' these things that are wreckin' what we got. 

00:28:35
MARIE Okay. 

00:28:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Because these are tangible things. You go down to your office there where you're workin', and you start criticizing, blaming, complaining about the people you work with, they're not gonna work as hard. This doesn't work with a, this kills human relationships. And you're doing it. You say you're not doing it overtly, but she's getting the message. You have to tell her that you know you're giving her the message if you want it to work. She'll appreciate that. 

00:29:05
MARIE She will? 

00:29:05
WILLIAM GLASSER I think she will And she'll appreciate if you'll tell her I wanna stop doing this. And, if I can stop doing it, we'll get along better than we have, but I need your help, I want you to point out and just say to me, honey you are aware of these things you're doing it now, could you stop. And then you'd say to her, probably. But what should I do instead? And she'd say well, you know, you're a creative person, you're running a new business and everything, could you come up with some things that we could get closer? That wouldn't be criticizing me, blaming me, or complaining about me? So now, you be you now, don't be her. Could you come up with some things that you know that she would enjoy, even if it's for a short time, it would have validity, if for a short time you could have this togetherness without you doing these, three of these seven bad habits. 

00:30:10
MARIE So how long a time are we talking about? I mean, if I'm home for three hours, or four hours in the evening, am I asking her to be close with her for part of it? 

00:30:25
WILLIAM GLASSER I think if you're home three hours in the evening before you go to bed, a small part of it, let's say, an hour of really good attention to her, without criticizing, blaming, complaining, that you could creatively figure out, but it's also after you go to bed. People in, go to bed, a married couple, they frequently talk to each other, and they're close and they talk. And that's the time when you hold her that you could talk and she would say you're not doing it now. See you have to become aware of these things. You can't choose to stop something if you're not even really aware you're choosing it in the first place. You've sighing now, does this kind of seem impossible for you to do it? She won't want time with you if you spend 12 hours with her, is worthless. If these things are going on. She wants you do it with little children, she knows about little children, she works with them, you're lacking quality time. And so, you're saying well if I give her enough time, it doesn't have to really be quality time, because I'm there. And she says you're not there. 

00:31:40
MARIE Right. So, you think that if I told her that I would be there out of the three hours one hour of quality time that she would like that? She would be okay with that? 

00:31:55
WILLIAM GLASSER I don't know what she'll be okay with, but it'll be better than what you're having now. Does she work Saturday, or is she off Saturday? 

00:32:00
MARIE She's off Saturday. 

00:32:00
WILLIAM GLASSER And you go to work Saturday. Are people working there or is it just you down there on Saturday? 

00:32:05
MARIE No, people are working there. 

00:32:05
WILLIAM GLASSER People are working there. Could you say to your wife, why don't you come to work with me? We'll be together. Even if you don't do much, you'll see what I'm dealing with at work, and then we'll eat a good lunch together, and I'll get it outta my mind, we'll come home together, and that night, we'll have had an experience together where you've seen what I'm up against, I can't see what you're up against, which children, I'm sure up against a lot, you might even tell me a little of that, and I'll be willing to listen to you. Some way, see you're apart now. And the idea is to get closer together. It's not the amount of time you're closer together, it's the getting closeness. Once you get a certain distance, which you are already, there probably, the time doesn't make that much difference. 

00:33:00
MARIE Um, I'm still back there about her coming to work with me. 

00:33:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, do you work in a terrible place, which you're all dirty and everything? 

00:33:05
MARIE No, but I, I, it made me kind of weird to think that she'd be there watching me. 

00:33:15
WILLIAM GLASSER She might not be there watching you, she might bring a book along, you might give her a little something she could do. You might make her a little bit part of the thing. After all, if you make money, you're certainly gonna share it with her. Probably you wanna give her more than the money in terms of showing her you put up all this, we'll give you a lot, you don't look like a selfish person, you're trying to succeed. 

00:33:35
MARIE Yes. 

00:33:35
WILLIAM GLASSER If she doesn't wanna go, but tell her, on Saturday, we're apart all day long, just having you near me, just having lunch with you, maybe just having you come and then things you see could give me another pair of eyes because you love me. She's an intelligent person, isn't she? 

00:33:55
MARIE Yeah, she has some ideas, but, um, I, I don't think I would like that. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM GLASSER You wouldn't like that, huh? So you wanna keep the business and the, and the home separate Okay. I'm just trying to figure out what to suggest because, you're not coming up with much, and I feel that, I gotta help ya. 

00:34:20
MARIE I know. 

00:34:20
WILLIAM GLASSER How about the quality time in talking to her about the three things, criticizing, blaming, complaining, and have her remind you if you're doing it and say this is not getting us closer you think under those circumstances you could be a little more creative? Maybe laugh a little bit, maybe do something instead of, something new like maybe always picnic, but try, or boating, but trying something different that would take more tension from both of you. To bring you together a little more. Cuz picnicking, you can wander, boating you can really wander, you're not goin' over the falls and things like that. Do you see what I'm driving at? 

00:35:05
MARIE Yes, I know. I, I do find it, uh, strange to think that I made the choice. 

00:35:10
WILLIAM GLASSER You're still going back to that choice. 

00:35:15
MARIE Because these are gonna be choices that you want me to make. 

00:35:20
WILLIAM GLASSER Everything you do is a choice. You ti-, keep an eye on your life and see if you do anything that's not a choice for the next week. Say if you, if you withdraw from her a little bit, it's not a choice, it's just brain damage or something like that, I don't think it is. 

00:35:40
MARIE I think that's what she said once. 

00:35:40
WILLIAM GLASSER Yeah, well it feels to her like it's brain damage. What I wanna do, because I think this session's coming to an end, what I wanna do is see again in a week with this advice that I've given you, to bring you closer together. And see if you can do something like this for a week, tell her you're choosing it, tell her you're going to be aware that you're choosing it, and she can help you with that, cuz you won't be aware of it. But as soon as she reminds you you'll be aware of it. At some level you're aware of it, or you wouldn't do it, you couldn't choose to not pay attention unless you chose to not pay attention. You can't just not pay attention. Everything's a choice. Think about that, think about even at work everything's a choice. 

00:36:30
MARIE But she's gonna help me by pointing out all the things the she's pointing out- 

00:36:35
WILLIAM GLASSER She could point out that right now, you-, I feel as if you're complaining about me. Right now I feel as if you're blaming me, right now I feel if you're criticizing me. And she could even point out, and this is what you did that led me to feel that way, and I, and you told me you want me to explain this to ya, and then if you could be, say, well that helps because like I say, I wandered away from it. 

00:37:00
MARIE Okay. I understand. 

00:37:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Cuz you say, you wer-, this choice is an important thing. If everybody could kind of learn that they choose all we do, we would make a lot less destructive choices, and self-destructive choices. It's when we think it isn't a choice. When people say, you made me do it. She doesn't make you do anything. No one's ever made you do anything, even though it seems that way. I'm not making you listen to me, if you don't want to listen to me, you can not listen. You can go away and say guy's full of hot air. It's okay, I can't stop it. And then if you can come up with something a little bit creative at that time, it could really change your relationship. Keep her away from work, that was probably a bad suggestion, but you know I'm kinda desperate, I wanna help ya. I mean if I had a cure for ya, I'd give it to ya. All I know is, that when you begin to do the things that I advocate, you start thinking, if I do this or say this with any other human being in the world that I want to get along with, if you criticize the president or the congress, that's nothing. If you do it with your wife, your children, whom you work with, whatever, that's really something. And then you say to yourself, if I say or do this with this person, I wanna get along with, and you think of your hands here, and you say, are we getting closer or moving apart? And you always know. There's never any time that you don't know, because genetically all human beings wanna be close to some other human beings, and you married your wife to be close, not apart from her. And so when you break that genetic commandment to be close, by choosing one of these behaviors, you feel it instantly. And that feeling gives you kind of a little bit of insight. But you won't feel it yet, she has to remind you a little about it, but you have to learn this feeling. It's there but you don't, you don't pay attention to it, you just slough it off, well-, it's important to her. 

00:39:05
MARIE Okay. 

00:39:10
WILLIAM GLASSER So you come back next week, and if you want to bring her with you, I would be very, very happy. And we could talk about the same things together, which would be very, very powerful. But if she doesn't wanna come, you said she might, though. So I welcome it, but still do it all week so we have something to talk about next week. 

00:39:25
MARIE Right. 

00:39:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Because time is precious and you don't have a lotta money to waste on counseling 

00:39:30
MARIE Right, if it works, um, I'll come alone. If it doesn't work, I'll bring her. 

00:39:35
WILLIAM GLASSER No, bring her either way. If it works, let's celebrate, if it doesn't work, well we'll try to find-, figure something else out, that's all. We don't wanna give up on this-, this is a human problem. You know, if we want to stop the sun from rising, we can't do that. But when people are trying to get along with each other, there's always ways, and that's what you come to counselors for. We are people that help people get along with one another. You're miserable now, because you're not getting along with your wife, and you want to. 

00:40:00
MARIE Right, that's true. 

00:40:00
WILLIAM GLASSER So you have every reason to try to do this and if it doesn't work, bring her along. I think that we'll just work at it till it does work, I'm not used to kind of having people come to see me and pay attention like you're paying attention and not having something good come out of it, and I think it will. But if it doesn't, it doesn't, but I'm, I'm a, up-, if your wife wants to come in, I'm very, very optimistic. 

00:40:25
MARIE Okay, thank you. Thank you doctor. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Okay? Thank you for coming in, all right. Thank you. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
WILLIAM GLASSER In, in a sense, this is a problem about a problem. It's his problem, but it's a problem that's creating problems in her, and I have to deal with it, but only deal with it as much as I can, although we did role-play her a little bit, which is I think perfectly legitimate in therapy, but, uh, role-play that it's his choice in what he could do. The interesting thing to me was, as she role-played him, and she knows him very well, she's been seeing him for a while, that the idea of choice, Marie could you tell me did the idea of choice, when I told you about it as a counselor, did that come to you as a somewhat new idea? 

00:41:25
MARIE Uh, no, I, it was I was taking the words that I used that are similar to choice with him, and, um, like empowerment, and I was saying, well, you know, choice would be new for him to think that he's choosing to do this at- 

00:41:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Well, empowerment and other things are good words, but I think choice is the operate powerful word. And when people begin to realize I'm choosing this, just like if a person in a sense the man is upset, he's probably depressing, I call it, depressing a little bit, if he would say to himself, I didn't get after him about this, yet, we have time with, as he'd say, I'm choosing to depress this ideal with my wife, because of certain things that I'm actually doing. The more you say choice, the more people can realize that better choices are possible, because I think this is why I'm so against uh, organic psychiatry, the popular thing now, and the use of drugs, because they're saying, the people have no choice, they've got a chemical imbalance in their brain, if that were true, psychotherapy, this whole conference that we're doing here, would be worthless. But it's not true. Choice is powerful. A man named, uh, Benson came here, and he talked about relaxing. And how relaxing helps your physiology It helps your, how you feel. And, people really were interested in this. So, by making a choice, he was saying choice to do this meditation thing, that I can change your feel-, your physiology. Now, would we call that a mental illness? No, that's not a mental illness, that's good. But when we talk about mental illness, we say well that's no choice at all. It's just the much the choice to change your physiology to feel bad as it is to feel good. Because, your choice involves all the components of your behavior. Which are your acting, your thinking, your feeling and your physiology, when Dr. Benson was talking about the mind-body relationship, he was talking about something that doesn't exist, it's not a relationship, it's the same thing. Your mind and your body are all the same. Dr. Alexander Lohan, that's at this conference talks a great deal about the fact that your mind and your body are all the same, in that way I agree with him quite a bit. Well, I think that if there are any questions, I don't know how this works, I can't see a thing, I mean I'm blind to the audience. But if there anyone wants to ask a question, I'd certainly entertain it. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Uh, do you ask it from here? 

00:44:10
WILLIAM GLASSER I can hear it. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Okay, I'm wondering, assuming they come in the next week together, and things haven't worked, how you would proceed from there, and would you continue to focus on his choices, or would you also begin to explore her choices. 

00:44:25
WILLIAM GLASSER Uh, if it hasn't worked, and she came in, I would focus on both of their choices, and they're both choosing, and what they're choosing now is destroying the marriage. They're both withdrawing. And they're both blaming each other for those withdrawals. And so my marital counseling technique now, I called structured reality therapy is very powerful, and will help them become aware of what they're doing. And, uh, but definitely, to answer your question, her choices are just as important as his, and she doesn't think she's making choices either. She thinks that her misery is being caused by him, he thinks a lot of his misery is being caused by her, and they, what they learn in the structured reality therapy, to make better choices to help the marriage, the marriage is now flown out the window. But if she and I are married, this marriage is a connector, and if I make better choices to help the marriage, then we can really begin to help the other. But if I make the choi-, he resents making them to help her. But if he can focus on making them to help the marriage, then he's doing something he really can do and has control over. And I help them with this in the structured reality therapy. Is there another question? 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, I have one. 

00:45:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Yes. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Um, what I saw was you tenacio-, uh, tenaciously, uh, pursuing the idea of choice. And I wasn't sure, in the experience of the client, whether you saw this, this is really to the role-play, um, Marie, uh, whether you felt you had a choice. And, what one does when somebody clearly feels like a victim of his circumstance, even though you point out in all the logic of why there's choice, so I guess my question's two-fold. One is, in the context of the role-play, did you have the feeling that you had choice. 

00:46:25
WILLIAM GLASSER That's to Marie, yes. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN And the other is, what do you do when somebody is consistently saying and giving you all of the barricades um, to being able to view themselves as having a choice? Um. 

00:46:40
MARIE Well I, I brought it up several times with Dr. Glasser, because, uh, this person although not characterized as a victim in, in counseling, he, um, doesn't seem to have much energy towards thinking about new ideas like choice. Which is, uh, you know, a very good easy way to present somebody with, uh, ways of doing things differently. 

00:47:10
WILLIAM GLASSER Mmhmm, and I think the answer to the second part of your question, what I did because he is kind of a goal-oriented person, and I offered him a goal, which was to spend the next week seeing if there's anything he does that isn't a choice. And, if he were with me, even as he left I'd reinforce that, I said that'll be real interesting. And that, in a sense, is a way to deal with it because when I think when you ask people to point out things they do that aren't chosen, they have difficulty doing it. They say it came over me, and things like that. But then we focus on 'it came over you' may be the emotion, but we then move it into what I call total behavior I'm talking about in the situation, you were doing some acting and some thinking. Acting and thinking doesn't come over you as much as emotion. We just keep working on it, because if he doesn't become aware that this is a choice, then, the therapy won't be very effective. And, in my experience, working this way with clients, or I wouldn't have demonstrated this, is highly effective and shortens therapy considerably over doing other things like looking back into his past marriage, or explaining a, working toward, in great depth, how he feels, we established how he felt all right. So that's my answer, I don't have a better answer than that. I was tenacious, I think therapists have to be tenacious, because therapists the only people that can be tenacious and still the person will give you a hearing. They won't get tenacity among other people, like even from his wife, would be kind of a turn off. He came for help. You have to assume he came for help, and my job is to help him. One of the experiences with role-plays which makes them difficult, is that the role-player doesn't feel the urgent need inside to get help. That the client does. That makes the role-play more difficult in one way, but more valid in that the therapist will struggle with a variety of techniques to try and move this semi-immovable person that doesn't really feel any pain, and may even be enjoying seeing you struggle to some extent. This is all, this is all part of role-playing, and that's okay, I don't mind that, that's fine. I think Marie did an excellent job, and I appreciated her. Okay, bye. Okay, thank you again, very much, I was pleased to have this opportunity. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Will you take one more question? 

00:50:05
WILLIAM GLASSER Well I certainly will. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you for a nice, clear presentation, I have only one question. What are the other four of the deadly habits. 

00:50:15
WILLIAM GLASSER Ah, the deadly habits. The seven deadly habits of highly miserable people. Highly unsuc-, whatever they are, they're bad habits, the first is criticizing. It's the worse by far. The second deadly habit is blaming, complaining, nagging, threatening, and punishing in the Alphie Cone (ph) sense of, uh, rewarding to control. If you give people a reward to control them, then that's, that they don't like it. No one has ever been criticized by another human being that I can conceive of, and say to that other person thank you. I appreciate that. I was trotting down the primrose path, and you have now straightened me out, and now I'm trodding down the path of righteousness, I appreciate that very much. People don't appreciate it. They don't like to be criticized Constructive criticism is the biggest oxymoron of the world. There is no such thing as constructive criticism. It's the deadliest of the deadly habits. And as much as we can remove it from our relationships, our relationships will improve. If you run through the deadly habits again quickly, uh, you know, criticizing, blaming, complaining, nagging, threatening, punishing, and rewarding to control, don't use these if you're a married person for the next week. I can guarantee you by a week from today, next Saturday, you will have a better relationship than you have now. If you can persuade your mate not to use them, you'll have a much better relationship. But if your mate continues to use them when you don't use them, their ability to use them satisfactorily weakens. And don't forget that the worst criticism is when it's correct. That's what really bothers people. So if you're going to criticize people, at least do it badly, that'll help a little bit. I'm working in a black hole here, so I can't see anything. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Do we have time for another question? 

00:52:30
WILLIAM GLASSER Another question, absolutely. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Great. Um, I have a client that I'm working with who's a victim of domestic violence. She tells me that she has no choice in remaining in the relationship, because her perpetrator has said if she ever leaves him, or gets a restraining order, he'll kill her. 

00:52:45
WILLIAM GLASSER Absolutely, she's 100 percent right, she has no choice if that's what the situation is in remaining in the relationship. But she has a lot of choice, even with a terrible, terrible person like she's married to, in how she deals with the person. And if she can learn some choice theory, because as much as she's maybe one half percent at fault, and he's 99 and a half percent at fault, if she's still tries to do whatever she can, that from her standpoint doesn't separate him from her, even that half percent will be what she, better than she's getting now. I don't want to in any way minimize, in any way give you the idea I condone domestic violence, but she says she has no choice but to stay. So if I were counseling her, I would say, well let's take a look at the words that come out of your mouth, living with his man who is certainly a very, very terrible person to live with as you have explained it, a man that you believe with kill you if you even leave him. But still during the course of the week, words come out of your mouth, actions come out of your body with the words, it's total behavior. He even senses your feelings, and may punish you for feeling bad. These people are very sensitive to your feelings, and say I'll hit ya till you don't feel bad any more, knock you unconscious. So, there's always a choice, even though there isn't much of a choice, in this man's case, there was more choice, but uh, if you're willing to suffer the ultimate you know, have someone literally kill you, you always have a choice, I'm not saying that's a wise thing, but every day you're reading the paper how people who are given the choice about giving their wallet to someone or, or fighting to maintain it, and they get killed. That was a choice too. Not a very sensible one. Another question, we have maybe one minute? Okay, well, thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity.
