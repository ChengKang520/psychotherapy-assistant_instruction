JOSEPH WOLPE, M.D. A case of social aniexty 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Dr. Estrada from California, uhm, volunteered at the last session with Dr. Wolpe to, ah, be his client this afternoon for this presentation of a live demonstration of a social anxiety. So without further ado, I would like to introduce Dr. Wolpe and Dr. Estrada. 

00:01:10
[sil.] 

00:01:15
DR. WOLPE Your first name is Santiago. 

00:01:20
DR. ESTRADA Yes. Santiago. 

00:01:20
DR. ESTRADA What is your problem? 

00:01:25
DR. WOLPE Uhm, my problem is that, ah, I, ah, experience a lot of discomfort, ah, which I believe is anxiety. I don't understand it very well. I experience it, ah, in very particular situations. I experience it in situations that, ah, are usually, ah, receptions, wedding receptions, any, any type of social situation where, ah, I don't have a particularly defined role. Ah, I guess--the best to, to explain this is to give an example. Ah, I went to a birthday party just two weeks ago and there was maybe two or three hundred people there, it was a special kind of, you know, birthday party, and we walked in and I shook hands with the person whose birthday it was. And he shook my hand and greeted me very warmly and we embraced and then he stepped on to the next person and I was kind of standing there and all of a sudden, ah, I wanted to get out of there. I mean, after about--I don't know how long it was, it seemed maybe it was just a minute or two. I, I became very anxious and, ah, kind of like the way I'm feeling right now, shaking and, ah, uncomfortable. And, ah, and so I wanted to get out of there. In other cases, ah, the same thing is happened but I sat there and I tried to do, you know, relaxation techniques, deep breathing, ah try to tell myself that, you know, I try to work it out but I haven't been able to do it. And so what happens is that I become--it feels--when, when I do stay in that situation, the next thing that happens is that I start to imagine that people are looking at me, like the way they're doing right now probably. And, ah, you know, ah, ah, it gets very uncomfortable and it creates, ah, some, you know, some disc--some problems for my, for my wife, you know, who wants to stay there longer cuz, ah, you know, what I'll say, you know, when are we going to leave. And she'll say, we just got here. That's pretty much it. 

00:03:30
DR. WOLPE How, how long have you had this problem? 

00:03:35
DR. ESTRADA Well, uhm, it's interesting because I've always been--I've, you know, I've done a lot of presenting and I've done television, I've done radio. I've done all kinds of things and, ah, if I can--as, as far as I can go back, I even used to dance in the streets and, and panhandle when I was a kid. As long as I have a defin--defined role, it's not a problem. But I can go back to, god the sixth grade, you know, and I can remember a situation, ah, where I was invited to a party. It, it, it was a party, I think, and, ah, you know, I had never been to a party. I felt very uncomfortable. I didn't know what to do. And there wasn't any--if there had been dancing, I would have gone and asked somebody to dance. I wouldn't--as long as I have something to do, there's no problem. Ah, so I can remember it, you know, when I was a kid, ah, but I don't, ah, you know, so I, I can go back to it then but it wasn't, you know, so masked or I guess have become so habituated that I, ah, that I'm not sure how long it's been a problem. But it certainly has been a problem in the last, ah, I've become aware of it in the last, ah, two or three years. 

00:04:45
DR. WOLPE How old are you now? 

00:04:50
DR. ESTRADA How old am I? Uhm, I'm 40. 

00:04:55
DR. WOLPE So in sixth grade, you would have been something like 12? 

00:04:55
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, I was in sixth grade, I was older so I guess, I, I, ah, English is my second language, so I think I was thirteen already. 

00:05:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
DR. WOLPE Would you say in general that over the years, this has got better or worse or stayed the same or fluctuated? 

00:05:20
DR. ESTRADA I think that it has gotten worse, ah, yeah, I think it's gotten worse cuz I think I just haven't-- I've become more aware of it. Ah, and so because I am more aware of it, ah, it's worse. And, ah, I'm more--I know that it causes, well I, I, I'm positive, as I'm saying this I'm saying to myself, no it doesn't but it does cause problems for my wife. It's not--it's, ah, you know, when we go that kind of situation, she almost knows to some degree that, ah, I'll become, ah, uncomfortable, you know. So I've become more aware of it. Ah, this is kind of an aside, I've become more aware of it as I've become more sensitive to my, to my wife. 

00:06:05
DR. WOLPE Now, uhm, to what ext--to what extent does it really interfere in your life? 

00:06:15
DR. ESTRADA Well, this is what I was alluding to, it interferes in my life because, it's, ah, you know, I enjoy being with my wife and I care for her very much. And, ah, if we go to that kind of a sit--ah, that kind of a situation or that kind of an activity, we, you know, we're--we can't stay there very long, so we either end up getting frustrated or angry. And, and, ah, it does it in that way. And another way that I think is professionally, ah, I've always been involved, you know, as an officer, I've always had roles to play and, and like I said before, there's no problem. But I think now in my business, I have a small business, small company, and there are times where you go to, ah, social activities where all the people do is drink and talk and that's, you know, that interferes with my, ah, bottom line, with the profit that I make at the end of the year because I need to, to be able to do that, to, to increase my business. So it interferes with my, with my business and it interferes with my personal life. And, and, ah, ah . . . 

00:07:20
DR. WOLPE But in addition, insofar as it's, it's a situation that, that makes you anxious, it's kind of a source of, of pain? 

00:07:30
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, it is. It's, it's uncom--it's kind of like the feeling I'm feeling right now. It's an uncomfortable feeling because I breathe faster, I am nervous. 

00:07:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
DR. ESTRADA Ah, I feel, you know, ah, a little shaky. In those terms, you know, if that's what you mean that's, ah, you know, when, when the episodes occur, it's--they--yeah, those seem to be getting more intense. 

00:07:50
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:07:55
DR. ESTRADA Ah, and I don't recognize--another thing that's interesting is that I don't recognize what's happened until afterwards. I mean, you know, the reason that I volunteered for this is, uhm, because this--in--because I was somewhat, you know, inspired this morning and, and you mentioned the idea of flooding and I thought well, you know, this would be a great opportunity to take advantage of it, you know. Plus, I'm cheap, you know. I don't mind if they pay me, I just don't want to pay them, you know. Yeah. 

00:08:30
DR. WOLPE Well, ah, you, you mentioned that, uhm, an important, ah, factor is you're not having a role in the situation. In this is situation you do have a role. 

00:08:40
DR. ESTRADA Yes, I do. 

00:08:45
DR. WOLPE So apparently this is a role that, ah, doesn't quite fit the bill? 

00:08:50
DR. ESTRADA No, I, no, no it doesn't. 

00:08:50
DR. WOLPE Well, so now what, what is there that's different between a role like this and a role that would make a difference? 

00:09:00
DR. ESTRADA Well, the difference is that I could play this role because I, I've had training, formal training in theater. I know how to act, I know how to create a character and maintain it. And I can do that but if, if I do that, it's like, ah, you know, pointing--if I go into the dentist and say my right molar hurts when it's my left and so if I get into that mode, I feel like am I going to get the help that I want from you. 

00:09:20
DR. WOLPE Yeah, but that's not quite the question. The question is, you do have a, a central role right now in this room. 

00:09:30
DR. ESTRADA I'm the patient. I, I . . . 

00:09:30
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:09:30
DR. ESTRADA . . . I would say, yeah. 

00:09:35
DR. WOLPE Now, ah, it seems that, that, uhm, that role is not the same. It, it doesn't have the same, well, uhm, beneficial or protective effect as another role. Let's say you, you were doing, you were doing a dance on the stage. 

00:09:50
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:09:50
DR. WOLPE That would be better? 

00:09:50
DR. ESTRADA A dance? I could handle a dance. 

00:09:55
DR. WOLPE Well, but, but would you feel different if you, if you were doing a dance? 

00:10:00
DR. ESTRADA Oh yeah. I mean, I wouldn't feel the way I feel right now. 

00:10:00
DR. WOLPE Okay then. 

00:10:00
DR. ESTRADA Oh yeah. 

00:10:00
DR. WOLPE Then what is the critical difference? What does, what is . . . 

00:10:05
DR. ESTRADA Oh, okay. 

00:10:05
DR. WOLPE . . . in the dance that is not in the present situation? 

00:10:10
DR. ESTRADA The difference is that I'm not in control. I mean, I feel like I'm not in control. I feel like you're in control. 

00:10:15
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:30
DR. WOLPE Now that's, that's a very important statement. Are there, are there other situations, I mean, the--in life, there are, there are many contexts in which one may or may not be in control. Are there any other, uhm, not control situations that you can think of that produce the same effect? 

00:10:55
DR. ESTRADA Hmm. Yeah, I guess there are times like, uhm, and I'm hav--I'm have--I'm stretching. I feel like I'm stretching. Ah, perhaps in, in a department store like if I'm in line or something like that and I--if I--I always carry a book. I always have-- I always have something to do it seems, most of the time, I have something to do. I--and I make sure of that because, ah, again, I, I can do small talk and--but when I do that, I have to put myself in that role, ah, of a conversationalist but most of the time, I would prefer to read or I would prefer--I don't particularly enjoy small talk. Ah, so yeah, there are--like it could be, it could be in a barber shop, it could be in the department store. If I don't have something to read or something, I'll look for something to read. Ah . . . 

00:11:45
DR. WOLPE Because reading is doing something definite? 

00:11:50
DR. ESTRADA Yes, yes. I, I--when I'm reading, I--yeah, exactly. It's just me and the book and I don't have to, ah, interact with others. I guess. 

00:12:05
DR. WOLPE Now, you, you gave an example of when you were in the sixth grade, when you felt like this. Can you. . . 

00:12:15
DR. ESTRADA You know, I just--I just got a, a real clear picture of a situation when I was maybe even before the sixth grade because--well, it might have, it might have been like in the second or third grade. I, I, I did all--I was always interpreting for my mother and father because they didn't' speak English. And I remember once in a hospital, ah, interpreting and, ah, the doctor just stopped talking and my mother kept asking me, you know, what he said or what was happening and I, I, I couldn't, ah, there was nothing I could tell her. I just told her he stopped talking. And it became very, ah, uncomfortable and I didn't have at that time, you know, I didn't have the courage especially at that time cuz I just--I didn't have the courage to tell the doctor that my doctor was upset, you know, because he, ah, he wasn't saying anything. I don't remember how long that lasted, maybe three or four minutes. 

00:13:10
DR. WOLPE So, uhm, your mother was very upset, the doctor wasn't talking and you were very upset? 

00:13:20
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, I was. In fact, right now I experience the anger. I just--I, you know, I got angry and I experienced it right now. I got angry cuz there was nothing I could do to get him to, ah, to talk to us. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
DR. WOLPE But, ah, I don't get the picture very clearly. I mean, the, the doctor was explaining something through you to your mother? 

00:13:45
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:13:45
DR. WOLPE And, uhm, he suddenly stopped talking. I mean, what was it? Was he distracted or what? 

00:13:55
DR. ESTRADA I don't remem--I don't remember. I really don't remember. It was--like I said. It came--it--well, it came to me in a flash. I just remember being in this--might have been a clinic, and, you know, he--I was translating, ah, and I translated. I told my mother--I forget what the question could--I don't know what the question was--something to do with, with her health. Ah, and, uhm, it had something to do with whether she was going to stay in the hospital or not or may even have had something to do with, with an operation. I don't remember clearly. I just remember that after that occurred, ah, he, you know, he, ah, he stood up and like he did something and he came back and he sat down and she's saying [non-English narration]and, ah, ah, you know, I tried to ask the doctor, you know, what, what's going to happen to my Mom or--I didn't know how to, you know, ask the question I guess, and he didn't say anything. He kind of sat there and he was, you know, pensive, thinking, looking through the--through the file and, and, you know, doing, doing that. 

00:15:05
DR. WOLPE He was . . . 

00:15:05
DR. ESTRADA And I was sitting there and I didn't know what--after a while I just sat there. I didn't know what to do anymore. 

00:15:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. In a way, he was ignoring you. 

00:15:10
DR. ESTRADA Yeah. 

00:15:10
DR. WOLPE Or you were, or you were just, you, you, you, ah . . . 

00:15:15
DR. ESTRADA I fel--I felt ignored. 

00:15:15
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Did he eventually, ah, come out with the necessary information? 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:30
DR. ESTRADA I don't remember. I, I believe he did. I mean, I guessing that he did. 

00:15:35
DR. WOLPE Anyway, you, you felt very, very upset in that situation? 

00:15:35
DR. ESTRADA Yes. I felt very powerless. 

00:15:45
DR. WOLPE Do you think this is the first time this happened? 

00:15:50
DR. ESTRADA Do I think it's the first time that happened? I don't know. I don't believe so but I don't know. 

00:16:05
DR. WOLPE Okay. 

00:16:05
DR. ESTRADA Because I can go into a whole bunch of other stuff from that that's just, uhm, I believe that being--where I grew up and--there was a lot of times, no, no, I, I guess there was a lot of times that I felt powerless, ah, but I think that probably was one of the first times that I became aware of, as I look at it now, there was, there was a moment there, there was time there and, ah, you know, I didn't know what to do. I was--I must have just been learning English at that time because when I went to school, I couldn't speak English. 

00:16:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:16:35
DR. ESTRADA And I know that that was, I mean, I just ran away from school every chance I got. So, ah, I'm sur--I must've felt--that's probably why I ran away. I probably was uncomfortable. In fact, I--well I'm not sure, I'm not sure if I was uncomfortable or it looked better outside but I know I ran away a lot. And I didn't understand what they were saying. 

00:16:55
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Well, you felt, ah, powerless in that situation. And al--also in general in all of these situations as, as you've put it, there's a lack of control. 

00:17:10
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, I feel like I don't have, ah, control of the situation. 

00:17:15
DR. WOLPE Well, there are also other kinds of situations that, that we all experience where, where we don't have control. Uhm, can you think of any others which are not of this type where you have a feeling of lack of control? 

00:17:30
DR. ESTRADA Where I have a feeling of lack of control? 

00:17:35
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:17:35
DR. ESTRADA Uhm, yeah, I can think of obvious things like if I'm watching a football game, I don't have control of who's going to win. 

00:17:40
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:17:45
DR. ESTRADA Ah, I don't have control, ah, over whether, you know, whether you like me or not. 

00:17:50
DR. WOLPE Whether your--and whether your team will win or not. 

00:17:55
DR. ESTRADA Exactly, I don't have any control over whether the team's going to win or not. I . . . 

00:17:55
DR. WOLPE But, but does that produce, ah, any, ah, distress? 

00:18:00
DR. ESTRADA Not, not, no not, not severe. I mean, if I'm betting some money, I'm a little, you know, uncomfortable but, but, ah, no. No, I don't feel real uncom--well, it depends. You know, if it's, like if it's the Rams, which is my team, I mean that, you know, I, I might feel a little uncom--you know . . . 

00:18:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:18:20
DR. ESTRADA . . . very uncomfortable. I did when we played San Francisco last week. 

00:18:25
DR. WOLPE Well, what about if, ah, you're in a car that somebody else is driving? 

00:18:30
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, yeah, you know, that's something that's very interesting. Ah, I very rarely let other people drive. 

00:18:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:18:35
DR. ESTRADA Ah, but I let my wife drive and I--again, it's, it's I do that, ah, because I'm trying to grow. I'm trying to, ah, you know, I'm trying to change a little and, ah, so I'll do that but, you know, it's really difficult cuz I'll end up-- cuz, of course, I know how to find parking places better than she does. That kind of stuff. I'll say why didn't you park over there. Yeah, that's difficult. 

00:19:00
DR. WOLPE Okay, but you, you let your wife drive but when she does, ah, do you feel entirely comfortable? 

00:19:10
DR. ESTRADA No! No, I don't. And, and I don't. And I don't let her drive. But she, she, ah, she just, you know. She's not here or else, I'd really be making a point of that one. 

00:19:25
DR. WOLPE Well, let me get some kind of, of a quantification of this. Ah, you remember this morning, we, we did this, ah, subjective anxiety scale. 

00:19:35
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:19:35
DR. WOLPE Where you can rate anxiety from zero to 100. 

00:19:40
DR. ESTRADA Right. Pierce (ph), ah . . . 

00:19:40
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:19:45
DR. ESTRADA . . . Sarason (ph), yeah. 

00:19:45
DR. WOLPE Right. Now, uhm, let's--well, let's talk from present moment. Sitting here in this situation we are in a sense, ah, well, you don't have control, how much anxiety do you have? 

00:19:55
DR. ESTRADA Right now? 

00:19:55
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:19:55
DR. ESTRADA On a scale of one to . . . 

00:19:55
DR. WOLPE From zero to 100. 

00:20:00
DR. ESTRADA Zero to 100? Right now, at, at this moment, it's probably like maybe 65. 

00:20:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:20:05
DR. ESTRADA Ah, it probably was like 80 right, right before this. 

00:20:10
DR. WOLPE I see. Now, of course, it's a special situation because there's an audience. 

00:20:15
DR. ESTRADA There is?! No. Yes, okay. 

00:20:20
DR. WOLPE Now, suppose, supposing you--that there was no audience and you were sitting with me in my office. Would that be any different? 

00:20:30
DR. ESTRADA Well, that's an interesting question because when we were sitting over there talking before this . . . 

00:20:35
DR. WOLPE Yes? 

00:20:35
DR. ESTRADA . . . I was, you know, again though it's the context. It's still, you know, I feel if we were in the office probably by now I would have, I would be relaxed. I probably would be--but, you know, it's, it's hard to tell. I, I may not because of, you know, of who you are and, and, ah, some other factors. 

00:20:55
DR. WOLPE Okay, well I think a, a good useful comparison would be with when we were sitting over there and talking privately . . . 

00:21:05
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
DR. WOLPE . . . there was no audience. How did you feel then? 

00:21:05
DR. ESTRADA Over there? 

00:21:10
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:21:10
DR. ESTRADA Probably, as far as discomfort, probably a, a 70, 75. I was anxious, I wanted to get started as soon as possible. 

00:21:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay, so clearly the, the audience is playing some part here? 

00:21:25
DR. ESTRADA It is some part. I'm trying to, you know . . . 

00:21:30
DR. WOLPE All right. 

00:21:30
DR. ESTRADA . . . forget they're there. 

00:21:30
DR. WOLPE So I, I really, uhm, want this as a kind of point of comparison. 

00:21:40
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:21:40
DR. WOLPE In the situation where you're sitting next to your wife and she's driving the car, how much is your anxiety level? 

00:21:50
DR. ESTRADA Uhm, you know, that, it, it varies. If I relax and completely just tell myself, you know, but I do, I'll actually do relaxation exercises and I'll just say, you know, leave the driving to her. And if I tell myself that and I stay with that, you know, I can be at a 20, 30. 

00:22:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:22:05
DR. ESTRADA However, if I don't do that, then I'm watching and I, you know, I'm probably--could be a 70. 

00:22:15
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:22:15
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, and get up to even 99 sometimes. 

00:22:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. But, ah, to get to control on the other side, when you're driving your car yourself and she's sitting next to you, what's your score? 

00:22:30
DR. ESTRADA My score? 

00:22:30
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:22:35
DR. ESTRADA It's about a five or a 10. 

00:22:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
DR. ESTRADA I'm pretty relaxed. 

00:22:35
DR. WOLPE Well, ah, do I, do I correctly understand it though, what you're saying then really there's a certain alertness because of the road and that's a, you know, you're, you're somewhat keyed up but essentially you're not having, you're not really having anxiety. 

00:22:50
DR. ESTRADA Oh no. Not at all. 

00:22:50
DR. WOLPE Okay. Now let's go, let's go back to the situation with your wife driving the car. Uhm, and if, if you don't distract yourself in some way by relaxing and so forth, the, the score can be pretty high. 

00:23:10
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:23:10
DR. WOLPE Now, to what extent is the height of that score controlled by the circumstances in which she's driving? For example, she may--can be going, going, ah, at, ah, 15 miles an hour, ah, say behind a funeral pro--procession. 

00:23:25
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:23:30
DR. WOLPE Uhm, she could be driving along a, you know, a clear country road with no other traffic. She can be driving on the expressway. Now do these things make a difference? 

00:23:40
DR. ESTRADA Yes. 

00:23:40
DR. WOLPE Well, give me some conception. 

00:23:40
DR. ESTRADA Well, I think that, for example, uhm, if we're on the, if we're on a freeway--let's say like we're on a freeway like, let's say from, ah, Newport--like if we're on our way to San Francisco and we're going through I-5 and it's, it's desert and, uhm, you know, I can relax. You know, I can get fairly relaxed. Ah, but let's say if there--she has to stop and make turns and, and that kind of activity, ah, that--then I become very uncomfortable, or if she's looking for a parking place or if we're going, you know, to a game or a concert or whatever and there's parking places, I, I, ah, get anxious about that. In certain kinds of traffic, where there's traffic, ah, I get, you know, I'll get anxious in those situations. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:35
DR. WOLPE Well, is, is there any way of, ah, sort of, uhm, categorizing this, this, this variable? Uhm, one, one thing one might think of, although it may not be the only thing is, a relationship between what you might call the, ah, ah, your--the driving hazard situation and your anxiety. I mean, it, it . . . 

00:25:00
DR. ESTRADA I see. 

00:25:00
DR. WOLPE . . . it needn't be that but I'm just rais--raising that question. 

00:25:00
DR. ESTRADA I'm not conscious of that. It's a good question. Ah, I'm not conscious of hazard. What I'm conscious of is, is that if--is that I put myself in the driver's seat . . . 

00:25:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:25:15
DR. ESTRADA . . . you know, and I--if I see like for example, parking is the best example I can give. If we go to a game and there's, you know, I would figure out a way to take a short cut to get that parking place. Like run over somebody. No. But, ah, see I would do that and so I, I, I'll transpose myself into the driving situation. I'll, you know, I'll do that when I see an opportunity, when I'm paying attention. 

00:25:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. All right. Now let us suppose that, uhm, this, this is a, a poorly attended match that, that you're, ah, driving to or your wife is, ah, doing the driving. Ah, there are very few people. So it's not the Rams. And, ah, well, there, there are, ah, nevertheless, uhm, well wait a minute. Whi--while you're driving with her in this situation where there are not many cars, what would your anxiety level be? 

00:26:10
DR. ESTRADA Well, if there aren't very many cars, you know, maybe if I'm, again, paying attention without doing the other exercises . . . 

00:26:20
DR. WOLPE Yes, because you see, we can't really talk this thing . . . 

00:26:20
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:26:20
DR. WOLPE . . . talk about the other exercises . . . 

00:26:25
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:26:25
DR. WOLPE . . . because they are, they are distractions. 

00:26:25
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:26:25
DR. WOLPE And we are interested in your being able to be comfortable when, when, when these situations have their full impact upon you. 

00:26:30
DR. ESTRADA Yes, yes. Okay, I would say probably I'm--it's hard for me to say--between 40 and 50, 55. It, it . . . 

00:26:45
DR. WOLPE Okay. 

00:26:45
DR. ESTRADA . . . would be a variance there. 

00:26:45
DR. WOLPE All right. Well, that's ballpark. Then, as you enter the parking lot, there's a beautiful parking place that you see and you would make for it and she doesn't. What happens to your score? 

00:26:55
DR. ESTRADA Well, it goes up to 99. I mean, it goes real high. 

00:27:05
DR. WOLPE Now, the question really is--or a question is, how important is it really to get that parking spot? 

00:27:15
DR. ESTRADA Not--it's, it's not that important. It's not that important at all. I know--I know that. I mean, I know that afterwards. 

00:27:25
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:27:25
DR. ESTRADA When I'm in the middle of it, I mean, it's life and death. 

00:27:25
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay, well look, it seems, it seems to me that, ah, there is a, a respect in which, ah, this driving situation provides a kind of core, ah, model for this, ah, you know, reaction to loss of control. But I, I want ask you, I want to take it further and ask you, can you think of other situations, not driving situations, that do the same thing to you? 

00:28:00
DR. ESTRADA There might, yeah, there--and this, this is far-fetched, there might be a situation in a discussion perhaps where a point's being made and I, ah, I have a different kind of point, I may feel a little--you know, those kind of feelings if I don't have an opportunity to express, you know, the other thought. Ah, but that's--I can't think of any other, you know, right off hand. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
DR. WOLPE Now look, apart from the--these kinds that we're talking about, are there any sources of emotional disturbance in your life? I don't mean--obviously everybody has problems and stresses and so forth, but I mean of this kind, sort of what, what you might call neurotic types of problems? 

00:28:50
DR. ESTRADA Me? 

00:28:55
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:28:55
DR. ESTRADA Ah, no. No, I don't, ah, I don't think so. No, there, there may, you know, there may be. I, I, ah, first of all, I'm embarrassed right now. Ah, uhm . . . 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:15
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, there are. Ah, I think there's situations, for example, like a conference like this, ah, which I don't particularly enjoy and I don't, I don't par--I don't participate in conferences unless I'm, I organized it and I'm running it. Ah, you know, and I can do that very well but if I come here and I really don't, again, don't have a role, I have to, ah, like this morning when we sat with a group of people and I didn't know them and, ah, you know, I just kind of got into this role of introducing myself and doing these things because if I didn't, I just forced myself to do that, otherwise, I wasn't going to be able to enjoy my breakfast. And I--so I forced myself to do that. So these kinds of, of situations are-- can be uncomfortable . . . 

00:29:55
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:29:55
DR. ESTRADA . . . for me and I avoid them. 

00:30:00
DR. WOLPE Okay, but, but in any case, ah, these are really, ah, variations on the same theme? 

00:30:05
DR. ESTRADA Yes. Yes, I guess they are. 

00:30:05
DR. WOLPE Ah, so I'm really asking you, are there any other themes? 

00:30:10
DR. ESTRADA Any other themes? 

00:30:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:30:10
DR. ESTRADA Well, I think that I just got through writing a, a manuscript and, and, ah, an opportunity to plug it, ah, but in this, this book that I'm writing, it's called A Cry of Hope, and in it it has to do with self-esteem. I think that I have always had a problem, you know, with that, with feeling good about myself and, and who I, you know, particularly my ethnic group and, ah, the particular ethnic group and socioeconomic status. And I think that in reviewing my life and, you know, applying my particular approach that I utilize in, in therapy, that it's real clear that I had a real problem all of my life with self-esteem and that's why I, I would characterize myself as an overachiever. Ah . . . 

00:30:55
DR. WOLPE Okay, now let . . . 

00:30:55
DR. ESTRADA . . . so there's that theme, I guess. 

00:30:55
DR. WOLPE Okay, well that, that leads to something else. Ah, insofar as there, as there is this problem of self-esteem, is it, uhm, well, is it entirely the way you view your--view--the way you view yourself or is it related to the way other people view you as well? 

00:31:20
DR. ESTRADA I think it's both. Yeah, it's the way that I view myself and, ah, I think it's that first, how I view myself and, obviously, I learned that, ah, and, and I've done a pretty in-depth analysis of my life and there were times, in the time I was growing up, where there was a lot of--significant amount of negative reinforcement as far as, you know, being a Mexican was concerned. 

00:31:50
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:31:50
DR. ESTRADA Ah, so that, you know, that didn't, ah, it didn't help my self-esteem. 

00:31:50
DR. WOLPE Well, let's, ah, sort of, you know, plant your head a little bit because of the shortage of time . . . 

00:31:55
DR. ESTRADA Certainly. 

00:32:00
DR. WOLPE And, ah, let, let me ask you this. I mean, uhm, insofar--ah, well, you, you say in general, you are concerned about the, the opinions of others. What are the dimensions, the, the dimensions along which the, the, uhm, negative opinions of others are important to you? 

00:32:20
DR. ESTRADA I'm not sure I understand. 

00:32:20
DR. WOLPE Okay, well, ah, for example, supposing somebody where, where to--you, you had the reason to think that, that somebody, ah, who you respect, regards you as, uhm, lazy. Would that bother you? 

00:32:40
DR. ESTRADA Yes. I have a hard time, you know, real hard time relating to laziness. It would bother me if somebody, ah, that I respected even, you know, even you, who, who I don't know, ah, but I, you know, I respect your work. And, ah, in fact, I experience it down there, I wasn't sure whether, you know, you were paying attention to what I was saying. You were looking around while you--I don't think you were. 

00:33:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:33:05
DR. ESTRADA But at that point in time, you know, I felt, yeah, that, that I felt a little anxious. But I was able to, you know, to tell myself that obviously you were a little nervous too about doing this. 

00:33:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Well, I, I . . . 

00:33:20
DR. ESTRADA Obviously, you weren't, I mean . . . 

00:33:25
DR. WOLPE Okay. Well, we actually dealt with that at the time . . . 

00:33:25
DR. ESTRADA Yes. 

00:33:25
DR. WOLPE . . . so I'm not going to go back to it. 

00:33:25
DR. ESTRADA Yes, we did. 

00:33:30
DR. WOLPE Ah, so, ah, but, but this, this is something like what, what I'm getting to and to--we can't possibly the way the structure is now, but something like this, uhm, I'll, I'll put it to you in a, in a kind of way which is easily manipul-- manipulable. Ah, and it's, it's actually a way in which I, ah, a setting that I often use in therapy. Suppose that you were sitting next to the window at a public library on the ground floor on a beautiful day and the window was open and outside there was a path on which people were, were walking. You would--you couldn't see them and they couldn't see you. But you could hear clearly what they were saying. And, ah, supposing, supposing what you heard, ah, was, uhm, the voice of, ah, a person who's well, moderately important in your life. You know, not very important. And he's saying something like this, ah, "Yes, I agree with you, Santiago's, ah, a very, a very nice guy but he doesn't really apply himself to things." Would that upset you? 

00:34:40
DR. ESTRADA Yes. Yeah, it would upset me more if he said I was incompetent. That would upset me a lot but that's--some--something like that would upset me, ah, if it was somebody I respected. 

00:34:50
DR. WOLPE Well, what about, ah, selfish? Self-centered? 

00:35:00
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, that would upset me too. 

00:35:00
DR. WOLPE Okay, you see, I don't want to go into this, but, I mean, you see, what we are getting to here is that quite apart from, from, from aspects where your, your own evaluation, your self-evaluation's involved, there is also a social aspect of what the other person thinks. Now clearly, the, the way you react in the kind of setting that, that I've put before you, it depends on two things, number one, the content of the criticism and the person who is making the criticism. 

00:35:35
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:35:35
DR. WOLPE And if we were going to go on, ah, to, to a treatment, we, we, we would, ah, we would have a kind of a, ah, an interactive analysis, you know. 

00:35:45
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
DR. WOLPE Ah, levels of anxiety in relationship to every combination. So we, we would have what, what we call, ah, a grid hierarchy. There are two dimensional hierarchy. And that, that would be part of the, ah, of what we would work on. 

00:36:00
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:36:00
DR. WOLPE To desensitize you to, to the, ah, to views of people, to opinions of people where it, it has no, uhm, no objective significance. 

00:36:15
DR. ESTRADA Let me see if I understand. So what you're saying is that-- first of all, that if I--that I would start perhaps by having a bus driver say something. 

00:36:25
DR. WOLPE Exactly. 

00:36:30
DR. ESTRADA Okay. And eventually to, ah, Carl Rogers or somebody like that. Right? 

00:36:40
DR. WOLPE Right. Now, uhm . . . 

00:36:45
DR. WOLPE I apologize. I'm not trying to . . . 

00:36:45
DR. WOLPE No, it's, it's okay, uhm, because after all, you and I have a special relationship. Uhm, in any case, you've, you've got the point. I mean, ah, it really doesn't matter if, if the bus driver thinks you're lazy, to, to take that example, but as the person becomes more important to you, it, it can be, ah, well, it can affect you more, although, uhm, objectively it may not matter anyhow. I mean, there . . . 

00:37:15
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:37:20
DR. WOLPE Uhm, there are certain things, take for example, selfishness. Ah, it's okay to be selfish, I mean, provided that we, we use it in the reasonable sense you know, to, to be . . . 

00:37:30
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:37:30
DR. WOLPE . . . doing things which are primarily for you, you take other people into account, but you're selfish. Now in--with that meaning accepted, then it doesn't matter who thinks you're selfish. 

00:37:40
DR. ESTRADA Exactly. I can see it. I mean, I can see a lot--I can see a lot of things. I can see now that, for example, in the social situation, one of the things that I, that I'm, that I can see now is that, I think what I've afraid of is someone's going to say, I don't belong there. 

00:37:55
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:37:55
DR. ESTRADA You know. If I have a role, I, I mean, it's irrational. I know it's irrational, but I think that's--when you were talking, I thought that must be, you know, one of the things that I'm frightened of is that I don't belong there. 

00:38:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:38:05
DR. ESTRADA Ah, if I have a role, you know, I guess one of these things makes me belong to some degree. 

00:38:10
DR. WOLPE Okay. 

00:38:10
DR. ESTRADA Ah, but yeah. 

00:38:10
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:38:10
DR. ESTRADA I can, I can see that. 

00:38:15
DR. WOLPE Yes, well, well see now that's, that's very important, very interesting, you see, because what is now emerging is that the rel--the relevant stimulus is something that you're inferring. I mean, even though you're not necessarily verbalizing it, ah, you're, you're sort of picking up a kind of an evaluation of, of the situation. We--in a sense, you're projecting it into somebody's else mind. 

00:38:35
DR. ESTRADA Yes. 

00:38:35
DR. WOLPE Ah . . . 

00:38:35
DR. ESTRADA Exactly. 

00:38:40
DR. WOLPE And, uhm, and so, you know, that, that is the thing, ah, the evaluation that, that is in your mind projecting to his mind is, is the, the subject matter which would be the content of desensitization in that context. 

00:38:55
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:38:55
DR. WOLPE Uhm, just to give you a, a parallel, there was a, a patient I had, uhm, years ago who, ah, used to get upset at, at the, ah, ah, the weekly meetings of his organization because he'd always think when he got up to speak, they are thinking so and so of me. 

00:39:15
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:39:15
DR. WOLPE No one ever said it, but he was thinking that. And he was reacting to, to his own thought. So, you know, that kind of thing could enter. Uhm, now. Let me get a lit--we've, we've very little time so, let, let me just get some of your background. Uhm, you grew up in Mexico. 

00:39:45
DR. ESTRADA No, I, I grew up here, in California. 

00:39:45
DR. WOLPE Oh. 

00:39:45
DR. ESTRADA My parents, my parents are from Mexico. 

00:39:50
DR. WOLPE I see. And, uhm, well, how many brothers and sisters do you have? 

00:39:55
DR. ESTRADA There were, ah, seven of us. 

00:39:55
DR. WOLPE Where did you come? 

00:40:00
DR. ESTRADA I was the last one. They were, I mean, some of them were, the 20--one was 20 years older than I was. 

00:40:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:40:15
DR. WOLPE Are your parents alive? 

00:40:15
DR. ESTRADA No. 

00:40:15
DR. WOLPE Ah, what sort of a person was your father? 

00:40:20
DR. ESTRADA He was a macho. 

00:40:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:40:20
DR. ESTRADA He was a real quiet man, real hard worker. Ah, and was very courageous and brave and, ah, very quiet and, ah, did not show a lot of, ah, emotion except when he got angry. 

00:40:40
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Was he, ah, good to you generally? 

00:40:45
DR. ESTRADA I loved him a lot and, and whether he--yeah, he was good to me as--he was very good to me. He was also, you know, he was very, very good to me but he also, ah, ah, did not show me--he did not give me a lot of attention or time. 

00:41:00
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Now when he lost his temper, now was that too any important extent directed against you? 

00:41:10
DR. ESTRADA If there was, yeah, of course. Yeah, when, when I, if I, ah, disobeyed him, ah, it was, it was directly at me. 

00:41:20
DR. WOLPE Well, was it reasonable. I mean, was . . . 

00:41:20
DR. ESTRADA Was it reasonable? 

00:41:20
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:41:20
DR. ESTRADA Well, yeah, it was, it was him getting upset--looking back on it, was reasonable. Ah, it's, it wasn't reasonable how upset he got. I mean losing his temper and losing control was . . . 

00:41:35
DR. WOLPE It was excess . . . 

00:41:35
DR. ESTRADA . . . unreasonable. 

00:41:35
DR. WOLPE In that way, it was excessive? 

00:41:35
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, it was excessive. 

00:41:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:41:35
DR. ESTRADA Yeah. He didn't--he never hurt me, you know, but, you know, I mean his--he yelled and, and, ah . . . 

00:41:40
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:41:40
DR. ESTRADA . . . that, that was very frightening. 

00:41:50
[sil.] 

00:41:55
DR. WOLPE And, ah, what about your mother? 

00:41:55
DR. ESTRADA My Mom was, ah, she's the funniest person I've ever met in my life. She was something else. She was just, ah, very, very funny, very sociable, ah, very--also very courageous woman. 

00:42:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:42:10
DR. ESTRADA Ah, she, ah, just, you know, I guess just to be--she was married at 12 and, and had children when--had her first child when she was 13. And she was totally, ah, she didn't speak Eng--I mean, she didn't write or read in either language but she was a very, ah, fantastic person. 

00:42:25
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. And, ah, was she interested in you and, ah . . . 

00:42:35
DR. ESTRADA She was, you know, she--I mean, it was a kind of mixed relationship. She, she lik-- she loved me and cared for me and, and she, and, ah, gave me a lot of attention. At the same time, I felt, you know, used by her because I was, ah, kind of her, you know, vehicle into the English-speaking world and there was times that, you know, that even at, you know, at the age of 10 or so, I knew that I was, you know, I was playing a part for her. Sometimes we were doing stuff or involved in activity that . . . 

00:43:00
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
DR. ESTRADA . . . that my Dad wouldn't have approved of. 

00:43:05
DR. WOLPE Well, so there were, there was a good feeling as far as . . . 

00:43:10
DR. ESTRADA Oh great, yeah. 

00:43:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:43:10
DR. ESTRADA I mean overall, yeah. After 20 years of therapy, I love her. No. 

00:43:15
[sil.] 

00:43:20
DR. ESTRADA No, we did--we had a good relationship, overall I think so. 

00:43:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:43:20
DR. ESTRADA Sure. Yeah. 

00:43:25
DR. WOLPE All right. She, she was, she was, ah, as I understand, never unduly punitive. 

00:43:30
DR. ESTRADA No, no she wasn't. Never. 

00:43:30
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:43:30
DR. ESTRADA On the contrary. 

00:43:35
DR. WOLPE Okay. Ah, now were there any other adults who played an important part in your early home life? 

00:43:40
DR. ESTRADA Yes, yes. There was a principal of the school. 

00:43:45
DR. WOLPE Oh no, your home life. 

00:43:45
DR. ESTRADA In my home life? Yeah, my--I had two brothers. One of them . . . 

00:43:50
DR. WOLPE Well, okay. Now I said adults but okay, tell me about your brothers. 

00:43:55
DR. ESTRADA Well, my brothers were adults. 

00:43:55
DR. WOLPE Oh, okay. 

00:43:55
DR. ESTRADA My brother was old enough to be my father. Ah, he was, let's see, I'm 40 so he was, he was about 17 years older than I was. 

00:44:00
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:44:05
DR. ESTRADA And he was a pachuco. Do you know anything about pachucos? No. Anyway, he was-- a pachuco was kind of like, I guess, perhaps not a hippie but that's as close as I can come to it. He was a--it was a subculture and they, they had their own dress and, and, ah, lang--dialect. And they were mostly, ah, found in gangs and, ah, drugs was part of that activity. 

00:44:25
DR. WOLPE You, you took part in this, ah, sort of hippie culture? 

00:44:30
DR. ESTRADA Me? 

00:44:30
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:44:30
DR. ESTRADA Somewhat. 

00:44:30
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay, so he bas--he then was of a positive, ah, person I guess? 

00:44:40
DR. ESTRADA Well, he, you know, it was kind of a mix. He was, ah, he was in San Quentin two or three times. 

00:44:40
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:44:40
DR. ESTRADA But even though he was, he was still a positive force in that he had a--he was--he had a personality like my Mom. He was very sociable and people liked him. Ah, I had another brother who was, ah, he, ah, he graduated valedictorian from . . . 

00:44:55
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:44:55
DR. ESTRADA . . . from the high school that he went to. And he--they both played a role in my development. 

00:45:00
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay. And there was nothing, nothing, ah, negative about that? 

00:45:10
DR. ESTRADA About . . . 

00:45:10
DR. WOLPE About the other brother? 

00:45:10
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, there was. I mean, in both of them, there was a negative factor in that, ah, this is another factor, I'm really, ah, is that in my mind, I believed that they were, ah, that there is--superior to me because they were light-skinned and, ah, they never, you know, they never did anything, you know, it was just, ah, something that I learned. I learned that from my mother. 

00:45:45
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. You felt them superior because they had, ah, lighter skin? 

00:45:50
DR. ESTRADA Right. I learned that when I was a child. I, I, ah, when I was small, my mother, as I said, didn't have a lot of education and she alluded to, to, ah, color a lot, you know. 

00:46:05
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:46:05
DR. ESTRADA To the other kids being--maybe their complexion, you know, gueros is what we call them. 

00:46:10
DR. WOLPE I see. Well, did, did that have a lasting impact on you? 

00:46:15
DR. ESTRADA A lasting impact. I'm not sure . . . 

00:46:20
DR. WOLPE Well, I mean, did, did you possibly . . . 

00:46:20
DR. ESTRADA Did I think about it a lot? 

00:46:20
DR. WOLPE . . . possibly, you know, go through life after that, ah, thinking of yourself as, well, inferior because your skin was darker? 

00:46:30
DR. ESTRADA Not, not--it wasn't a dominant feeling. After doing, again, a lot of analysis, I--it had a, it had an impact. Ah . . . 

00:46:35
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Okay. Uhm, well, we, we have to reach--to try, to try and condense things here. Ah, I, I would expect that, that your, your educational life was, ah, ah, pretty satisfactory. That your . . . 

00:46:55
DR. ESTRADA It was excellent. 

00:46:55
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:46:55
DR. ESTRADA I mean, it was-- it was, it was excellent. 

00:47:00
DR. WOLPE And, uhm. . . 

00:47:00
DR. ESTRADA It was excellent--I should say, it was excellent after I came back from Vietnam. I mean, it wasn't excellent until af--I went to junior college and when I came back from overseas . . . 

00:47:10
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:47:10
DR. ESTRADA . . . I just had tremendous, ah, motivation and I was able to focus and I did real well. Before I went overseas, I, I had a difficult time writing a sentence. 

00:47:20
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. Well, I think that basically, this is about as far as we can go. Obviously, we need to go into many things . . . 

00:47:30
DR. ESTRADA Yeah. 

00:47:30
Dr. Wolpe. . . in greater, ah, detail. Ah, we need to go into more things. Ah, we need to do some questionnaires, such as the, the, ah, Pierce survey schedule, which, you know, covers a very wide range, and, and, ah, I can't pretend that I have anything like a complete picture of you and that I'm able to hand you like this an answer to, to your problem. But I think that we do have enough to be able to say that if the following things were done, there would, there would be marked progress. And, uhm, essentially, uhm, we could, we could adopt, ah, two lines of action and both of them would involve the use of, ah, systematic desensitization. In the, the one, in the one, we would, ah, ah, take the theme of lack of control, ah, very, ah, possibly using the situation of your wife driving a car and we could quantify that. In other words, ah, you know, driving, uhm, very slow on such a road, fast on another, and so forth. In other words, we, we could have a, ah, an anxiety quantification of, of the different situations in which, in this, in this sense, you, you, you are abandoning control in increasing ways. This control, of course, being, ah, lack of control being measured by the increasing levels of anxiety. So that could be, ah, ah, a basis for, for one desensitization program. And the other one would be the, the one that we touched upon which involves, uhm, the opinions that other people have of you in, ah, different areas. And these would be imagined in a state of calm, systematically until eventually you wouldn't, ah, turn a hair at any of them. 

00:49:40
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:49:40
DR. WOLPE Now, there are, there are . . . 

00:49:40
DR. ESTRADA And you'd use this, this, ah, systematic desensitization for both of them? 

00:49:45
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:49:45
DR. WOLPE Okay. 

00:49:45
DR. WOLPE But they're quite different. 

00:49:45
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:49:45
DR. WOLPE I mean, the whole, the whole, ah, subject matter is different. Uhm, there's, there's also another area which I can see, which relates much more broadly to what you have called self-esteem. And, uhm, I would have to go into it. I mean, I don't really know, you know, how to, how to, uhm, uhm, well, I, I don't even know what to say about it because I just don't know enough about the, the directions in which I would go. 

00:50:20
DR. ESTRADA Can I send you my manuscript? No, I'm just kidding. 

00:50:20
DR. WOLPE Well, that sounds like a fitting award. 

00:50:25
DR. ESTRADA No, okay. I understand what you are saying. 

00:50:30
DR. WOLPE Okay. Well, are, are there, are there any questions that you have for me? 

00:50:35
DR. ESTRADA Ah, yeah. There is, as far as, as, you know, the, the quantification of the car driving versus the opinions that other people have, ah, you're saying, you're saying--are you saying that you'd use the same approach in order for me to become less sensitive, you know, to those, to those particular stimuli? Would I--is it the same approach or would it be a different approach? 

00:51:00
DR. WOLPE No, it's, it's, it's the same treatment. In the, the one context, we, we would be using the car situation, ah, in order to expose you to, ah, different quantities of, of abandoned control, ah, enabling you to, to accept these--to, to be calm . . . 

00:51:25
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:51:25
DR. WOLPE . . . in these until, you know, you, you were calm, ah, even, ah, at the most extreme, ah, reasonable level. 

00:51:30
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:51:30
DR. WOLPE And, ah, and the other one is to desensitize you to, uhm, adverse opinions of others. Uhm, when, when, when there's no harm objectively to, to, to be inferred from the, from the adverse opinion. You see, what you're doing there is, you are able to, to take the, the one, uhm, well, wait a minute. There are, there are two different things there. Uhm, I'm glad that I've reminded myself there. The first one is the, the, ah, negative labels that, that you would overhear of other people. 

00:52:10
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:52:10
DR. WOLPE And the other one is, ah, the, the, the situation of, uhm, ah, being with other people where, where you don't have control, where you're the underdog and you are inferring that they are thinking . . . 

00:52:30
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:52:30
DR. WOLPE . . . negative things about you. And what would have to be, ah, done there would be to sort of exteriorize, uhm, the, ah, the inferred negative labels. And so that would really be a third hierarchy. 

00:52:40
DR. ESTRADA That would be a third? 

00:52:45
DR. WOLPE Yes. 

00:52:45
DR. ESTRADA Okay. 

00:52:45
DR. WOLPE Because we have the, the, ah, the, your wife driving, we have the, uhm, sort of, ah . . . 

00:52:55
DR. ESTRADA The broad self-esteem? 

00:52:55
DR. WOLPE . . . fairly fo--fo-- formal--formal ideas and then the, the third one is the, is the, ah, the particular ideas that you get when people are, ah, ah, inf--when you infer people to be thinking something about you. But, of course, it's quite clear that the second, that these last two really might be coalesced. It may turn out that, ah, you, you will find the content for the two dimensional, ah . . . 

00:53:25
DR. ESTRADA Uh-huh. 

00:53:25
DR. WOLPE . . . grid in the kinds of, ah, ah, computized (ph) thoughts you have of them, nega--negative, ah, opinions of people when, ah, when you don't have control. 

00:53:40
DR. ESTRADA I, I don't understand that last . . . 

00:53:40
DR. WOLPE Okay, well, you were giving the example of, ah, when you went into introduce yourself to people this morning and, ah, you, you went out of your way to introduce content. It gave you a certain feeling of control and you then said that, that you had a feeling that they were evaluating you negatively. 

00:54:00
DR. ESTRADA Did I, did I say that? 

00:54:00
DR. WOLPE Well, you didn't quite say, say that but it, but, but . . . 

00:54:05
DR. ESTRADA Yeah, the general feeling, the general feeling is, is, is that, I would say, yeah, cuz I . . . 

00:54:10
DR. WOLPE Well, what, what I . . . 

00:54:10
DR. ESTRADA Yeah. 

00:54:10
DR. WOLPE . . . what I'm saying is that, it ought to be possible to verbalize in what way, ah, you, you sort of feel, feel them to be . . . 

00:54:25
DR. ESTRADA I understand. 

00:54:25
DR. WOLPE . . . thinking of you negatively. 

00:54:25
DR. ESTRADA Right. 

00:54:30
DR. WOLPE And you could be desensitized there either directly or more probably, as a component of the, of the, of the grid situation. But I'm not quite sure of that. 

00:54:40
DR. ESTRADA Right. Because in a sense I'm doing that to some degree. I mean, I'm doing it just to get, I, I, I do it enough to be able to introduce myself and do that first part . . . 

00:54:45
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:54:45
DR. ESTRADA . . . yet, ah, it's a reoccurring issue and . . . 

00:54:50
DR. WOLPE Uh-huh. 

00:54:50
DR. ESTRADA . . . that what I, you know . . . 

00:54:50
DR. WOLPE Yes, but you see, what is happening there is that you're coping with the situation. 

00:54:55
DR. ESTRADA Exactly. 

00:54:55
DR. WOLPE You're, you're not really removing your sensitivity. 

00:55:00
DR. ESTRADA Exactly. 

00:55:00
DR. WOLPE And what we want is to remove the sensitivity. 

00:55:00
DR. ESTRADA Yes. Yes. Well, thank you. 

00:55:05
DR. WOLPE Well, it's a pleasure to talk to you. 

00:55:10
DR. ESTRADA Thank you.
