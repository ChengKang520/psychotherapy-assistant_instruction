MICHELE HARWAY I'm, I'm Dr. Michele Harway. Umm… a, an expert on family and domestic violence. Umm… I have published a number of books in this area. I've done a number of continuing education seminars with marriage and family therapists, psychologist and other many health providers here in California as well as in other parts of the country. And I'm here today to talk about the context for domestic violence and the reason that mental health professionals really need to learn a great deal about this particular social issue. Umm… I often hear from people things like, "Well, I really don't need to learn much about this topic, because I don't plan to specialize in working with this population." So the first point I'd like to make is why it's so important for all mental health professionals to have knowledge and expertise in this area, even if they in fact are not planning to specialize in working with the population. First of all, let me give a few umm… statistics about the incidents and prevalence of domestic violence. These may not surprise you, there's been a great deal in the media, particularly during the O.J. Simpson trial, about how, how frequent domestic violence is as a societal problem. First of all, anywhere from 3.8 to 8.7 million couples are said to experience relationship violence. Umm… the number is very greatly… partly based on how the questions are asked. When the question are asked as part of a crime victimization survey, there are fewer people that respond that they in fact have been involve than this kind of, of an interchange than when it's asked in a different contexts. And also, exactly how the question is worded, what, what kind of violence is being ask about, will effect the number of people that admit to having participated in violence. Umm… violence effects people, not just who are in ongoing relationships, but it also effects who are dating. And the prevalence of domestic violence is said to range from 22% to 39% of college students, and is said to be even higher among dating students at the high school level. Umm… battering or domestic violence is not restricted to heterosexual couples. It's, umm… something that affects gays and lesbians also in very, very large numbers. And 3.3 to 10 million children are said to be exposed to relationship violence, with an understanding that more and more children are affected by exposure to violence. And I will be coming back to that point. There is also the fact that somewhere between 30% to 70% of batterers abuse their children as well. So they're not only being abusive with their partners, but they are also abusing their children. And there is some evidence as well that battered women are also, in some cases, abusing their children. So therefore, given those figures, umm… it is highly likely that a mental health professional is going to find somebody in his or her waiting room who has been abused by a partner, who is doing the abusing or who is part of an extended family of, umm… of a batterer or a battered person, or is a child who has been exposed to violence in the home. I wanted to make my listeners aware of the fact that I personally will use different terminology, and I suspect that other people will also be using a variety of different words to represent the same phenomenon, that is two people in an interpersonal relationship, whether it's violence being dispensed by one person against the other. Umm… the other thing that I want to make my listeners aware of, I am going to be using certain pronouns when referring to batterers. I am usually going to be referring to the batterer as the batterer or he, and the battered one I will often refer to as she. That is not to say that there aren't batterers who are female, who are in fact abusing their male, male partners. And as I indicated and reporting that there were, umm… a lot of… that there is a lot of violence in gay and lesbian relationships. There of course are male batterers who are abusing male partners and female batterers who are abusing female partners. So the, the diversity of kinds of batterers and kinds of battered one is such that I really should be using pronouns such as he or she throughout. Umm… nonetheless, not only is it difficult linguistically to manage that he or she's throughout, but also the, the statistics are still that the great majority of batterers are in fact male and the great majority of those who are battered are typically female. One of the, umm… interesting findings is that even when women are in fact the perpetrators, umm… the impact of their violence is much less than it is for men. And I wanted to quote something from a study by Heyman, Feldbau-Kohn, Enrensaft, Laughinrichsen-Rohling and O'Leary, 2001, and they said, "When only behavioral acts are measured, women and men appear to be equally aggressive. When the physical and psychological consequences of aggressive acts are included, women are far more likely to be victims than are men." Umm… and this is important because the media has made a lot of the fact that they are in fact quite a number of women who are violent. Much of the work that I do is in the area of training mental health professionals to asses for domestic violence when the clients present for various forms of psychotherapy. And this is a key point in what I want to share with you to today, it's the importance of doing the assessment. Umm… there are several pieces of information that suggest that mental health professionals have traditionally not done that assessment to the great judgment of, umm… their clients. In the late, umm… 1980s, umm… some colleagues and I did some research to test out what we'd been… What, what we had been reading about the family therapy literature, which seemed to suggest that in cases of domestic violence, psychotherapists that employed a family systems approach made both members of the system co-equally responsible for the violence. So my colleagues and I planned a piece of research to test out whether that in fact was the case. We've sent out questionnaires to a large group of members of the AAMFT, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, and we presented them with a, an actual case, umm… that was summarized in vignette form. There were actually two versions of questionnaire. One version in which a young couple had been sent to counseling because of violence in their relationship. The other case actually came out of case law, and it was a situation in which there had been violence and subsequent to a violent episode, he ends up killing her and it ends up in the, umm… in the case law because he used what came to be known as "the bitch deserved it" defense. And of course, the name says it all. Umm… but in our study, we sent out a version of the questionnaire that either had the case describing the young couple or had the case describing the couple with the fatal outcome, except we described all of the events up to but not including the fatal outcome. And we asked mental health professionals to tell us what was happening in the case, and what interventions they would make and what legal and ethical issues the cases raised. And we thought they would talk about how the victim was co-responsible for the violence. In one case, the victim had actually been on the telephone talking to a former boyfriend, in the other case the victim had been in a bar, drinking out late the night before. So we thought the therapists would tell us about the co-responsibility of the victims for the violence. And to our great shock, a majority of our respondents mentioned a variety of things that might be happening. The fact that there were family of origin issues, the fact there were, there were communication problems, but never even mentioned the violence. And we were perplexed by this, you know. Could it be that they could not see the violence? And in fact, the violence was very, very clear. In one case, the young woman was pregnant. He finds her in the phone booth talking to the ex-boyfriend and beats her up in the back, in the kidneys, causing her to miscarry. And then he claimed she beat herself in the back. Violence was pretty, pretty obvious. Umm… but… So we couldn't believe that the… that the, the results of our study were due to the fact that respondents could not see the violence. Umm… we thought perhaps what was happening is that the respondents saw the violence, but because they weren't trained about how to deal with cases of domestic violence, they focused on those issues that they could deal with, such as communication problems, family of origin issues and the like. We did a second study to test out that hypothesis. And again, we approached a large group of mental health professionals, and this time we used the second case, the case in which there had been the fatal outcome. We again presented the vignette to people, asked them what was going on, how will they intervene. And then we said to them, "By the way, we thought you would like to know that he in fact ended up killing her during the violent episode. Now, assuming you'd had the opportunity to intervene, what would you have done?" And this time what we got were a number of different interventions which were clearly not focused so much on the violence as on other issues. So we, we felt this was support for our belief that mental health professionals, at least at that time, chose to focus on things that they could intervened with, that they were trained to do, umm… rather than focusing on the violence because they really did not know what to do with the violence. Umm… this is what got me started in doing the continued education that I have been doing ever since, and much of the writing. Because it suggested to me that we must train mental health professionals to do this work, and that most traditional programs have not focused much on doing training in this area. I am supported in this belief by some findings of other, of other studies. The two other studies that I often cite that support the notion that therapists, even very well-trained therapists, really do not know how to, umm… to work with domestic violence. A very early study, one done by Goodstein and Page in 1981, examined women who were in emergency rooms, battered women who went to emergency rooms for various physical injuries as a result of the violence. And they asked them about their mental health experience, had they been to a therapist. And they found that a great majority of them had been to a therapist, but never returned. They went one time and didn't go back because the therapist never asked them about the violence. Umm… a more telling study to me is a very interesting study by Amy Holtzworth-Munroe and her colleagues at the University of Washington, which they published in 1992. They had been studying a sub-sample of the Gottman longitudinal study of couples. And the sub-sample included couples in which there had been incidences of domestic violence. They were interested in comparing this sample to couples who were maritally distressed, but nonviolent. And so they approached, umm… psychotherapists in the community and they had five different samples. And the psychotherapists facilitated their access to clients of their's who were maritally distressed, but supposedly non-violent, so that they could serve as a comparison group for the violent couples from the longitudinal study of couples. And they found that more than half of those couples, couples who were maritally distressed but supposedly non-violent, were in fact violent, with the husbands themselves reporting that they had been violent towards their wives in, in the, in short period time prior to, to the study. So when you take these studies together, it becomes really clear that mental health professionals must do an assessment in every case, particularly when it's a couple presenting. But I also would argue that in cases where a single individual, a woman, a child, when they present with certain kinds of, of symptoms. I would like to introduce you to a couple. It represents, umm… sort of the typical situation in which domestic violence, umm… happens. I like to present this case, because often the response that I get from the people that I trained is, "Well, I just don't understand why if there was violence in the relationship, why she didn't leave?" Very common question. So I like to give people some sense of how it is that an individual gets caught up in a violent relationship, and by the time she figures out what is happening, is unable to leave. I wanted to give you a flavor of that by introducing you to Susan and George. And I think that Susan and George are described in more detail, I am going to hit the high points. In my book, "Spouse Abuse: Assessing And Treating Battered Women, Batterers And Their Children" which I wrote with Marsali Hansen. Actually, the book is about to come out in second edition. It is published by Professional Resource Press, along with a great deal of other material on this topic. But Susan and George met at a church social. And right from the start, she was very taken by him. He is tall, he is good looking, he is very personable. He has a wonderful job, he is an engineer, and he basically is the man of her dreams. Meanwhile, he sees her as the woman of his dreams. She is intelligent, she is moral. She is financially able to contribute to the family and she is very beautiful. And they date for a short period of time, and their courtship is idyllic, which is often a very… fairly typical of relationships that eventually become violent. George was very romantic. He frequently buys her roses and gifts and he takes her to expensive restaurant. He basically sweeps her off her feet. And he enjoys spending time with her so much that they spend virtually all of their time together. Now, that's often true of fairly new relationships, where the two members of the couple want, in fact, to spend as much time together as they can. So that in and of itself is not necessarily of concern. But it's just something to note in these cases. One of the reasons that they spent so much time together is that Susan doesn't have much time after she leaves work. But also, George begins to give her reasons that he doesn't like this friend and that friend and the other friend. And because she wants to please him so much, she takes in the information that he give her, and she begins slowly to become alienated from her friends. One of the things that is often found in cases of domestic violence, is an increasing, umm… isolation of the victim from people in her circle. So when this kind of thing happens early in a relationship, it could be the beginning of a violent relationship. Umm… one other thing is that George kept telling Susan that she doesn't really need her friends, that he is really the only friend that she needs. And he really should come to her… Oh, I am sorry. He should… She should come to him because that's what a relationship is supposed to be. So by the time that George purposes to her, Susan has no friends left. He is really her only… her best and her only friend. And of course, she is so swept off her feet by this man that she immediately says yes, and she prepares for the wedding. But of course, he is very involved in the wedding. He wants a fancy white tie wedding, he wants a Saturday night wedding in a big hotel. He wants to Beef Wellington, he wants his brother to be the best man, he wants his sister to be an attendant, he wants his cousin to be an attendant. He doesn't want her brother. I think you begin to get a sense of the certain amount of control that George is exerting even in planning this wedding, which was something that Susan had dreamed about her entire life. And even though what he had planned was very different from what she had planned, she acquiesced because she is so in love with him. Again, this so far has nothing that suggests domestic violence. And yet, there are some red flags that have been raised by the behavior of, in this case, the groom. So, so far there's been nothing abusive or violent, but shortly after the wedding, George begins to change. And at first, he simply puts Susan down. She wasn't as perfect as he thought, but then she'd never been married before and maybe with a little instruction. And he starts criticizing her, then he nags her, he derides her, he begins to express unfounded jealousy, which is often fairly typical of relationships that are abusive. And he begins to spew insults about her family and her workmate. And then he begins to restrict her activity. He forbids her to leave the house during her time off, he controls the family finances. Most of the time, this is done under the, umm… with, with the impression that this is something to protect her. He doesn't want her to be out late at night because she can get hurt and so forth. But eventually, she complained… He complained so much about her work that she simply quits her job. And granted there is her participation in this increasing isolation, but sometimes it's just easier if you have a partner who is complaining about everything to simply acquiesce, and at that point the hope is that that he will in fact be quite. Of course, it doesn't happen in violent relationships. Susan feels some relief after she quits her job because sometimes thereafter she finds out that she is pregnant. And meanwhile, George is still at work, trying to isolate her from others, he begins to tell her things that her family has said about her behind the back and, you know, she begins to isolate herself from her family members. And then when the baby is born, George Jr., and George doesn't want Susan's mother to come stay with them. But throughout this, Susan keeps hoping. She keeps hoping that George is going to be kinder now that he has the son he always wanted. Of course, now he changes his tune somewhat, and not only is she, you know, doing many things wrong, but he finds fault with everything that she does for the child. He doesn't help at all with the child, but he does hold him and tells him how inept his mother is. And he is very upset with Susan because she's let herself go physically after the birth of the baby. And he is angry that she no longer looks like the woman he married. What we've noticed in, in this last part of the case, is a progression from isolation to greater control to a certain amount of verbal and emotional abuse that George has began to, umm… to display. But there has been no physical violence. First time that George struck her, Susan was stunned. And this is often the way that a battered woman will describe it. That it seems to come out of the blue, that there was nothing that seemed to lead up to that. Of course, if she were to look back and do an analysis of abusive behaviors that had preceded it, she would in fact see that there had been a whole constellation of abusive behaviors. And in this case, you know, he's been yelling at her because she is not doing a good job housekeeping, and she is not taking a good… care of the child. And then always sudden, he pushes her so hard that she falls over the coffee table. He punches her in the face, her ponytails come undone and they have this large physical fight. But the morning following the fight, George is very contrite. He tells her that he had so much pressure at work that he had lost his mind, and he apologies and buys her an exquisite bracelet to makeup for hurting her, and promises that it would never happen again. We begin to see what Lenore Walker in her… has described as the cycle of violence, in which there is cycle where the tension… Pick up with this over here on the board. The tension… tension has risen, and the relationship, it is followed by an explosion, which is the battering episode. Following the battering, however, there is what Walker has called the "honeymoon period." Where the batterer becomes apologetic, contrite, courts her to make up for the explosion. And inevitably, following that honeymoon period there is another period of tension rising, followed by another explosion, followed by honeymoon period and so forth. And the cycle of violence was something that, umm… that very few of us were aware of until Lenore Walker did a famous study of 500 battered women in a shelter in Colorado. And she interviewed them about their experience and found that, in fact, most of those relationships seemed to be captured by this cycle of violence. So in this case we have George who is in the honeymoon phase, who is apologizing and being contrite for what he is done, and the battering phase. But inevitably, tension will rise again and there will be another explosion and other honeymoon period. There is some evidence that in some cases, the honeymoon period becomes shorter and shorter. The, umm… If you talk to a battered woman who is unaware of this cycle of violence, she will often describe her partner as a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She is aware that there seem to be two sides of him which are captured by the part of him that is abusive and, and sometime the battering, and the part of him that is gracious and courts her. In fact, many battered women choose to believe that this is the real "George", whatever his name is, whereas this particular individual is an aberration. So getting back to, to George and Susan, this cycle continues. After the first violent episode and the first honeymoon cycle, there is a perpetuation of this pattern. And in the case of George and Susan, they come to the attention of mental health professionals when their daughter Katy is four years old, and Katy begins to have somatic symptoms. She goes to a very wise pediatrician who, umm… suspects that these are stress related, and recommends that the family seek counseling. And, umm… so I present this case to you so you get some sense of the insidiousness of the violence. By the time that that it's clear, umm… to Susan at least, what is happening, she's stuck. She has no job. She has no friends. I assume she has no resources. She has very little family willing to support her anymore. She's basically been cut off from all those support systems. And she has two children that she has to support. And this is the situation that many battered women find themselves in. The cycle of violence is a very useful tool when working with a battered woman to help her understand the experience she's been living through. Umm… as I have talked to clients who are battered, they describe a really chaotic situation, and as I mentioned already, they're able to describe their, their partners as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But they don't have a sense of how, how clear cut the cycle can be. So oftentimes, and educational tool is to introduce them to the cycle of violence, and it begins to order an experience which is felt chaotic to them until then. It makes a great deal of sense and they are able to begin to track as… When the tension rises and to begin to understand that it will inevitably be followed by an explosion and as, you know, as we may talk about later on, there are some things we can do to help them protect themselves and prepare themselves for that inevitable explosion. The problem with cycle of violence is that when it is described to somebody who is abusive, they have great difficulty recognizing themselves in this. Umm… they also have a great difficulty recognizing themselves in any kind of conceptualization about violence and abuse, which talks about power and control. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence that that power and control is the root of, of violent episodes in relationships. However, most abusers, most batterers when they are presented with this, have a great deal of difficulty recognizing themselves in this. They don't, do not feel powerful and do not feel in control. The next thing I am going to be showing you is a modification of the cycle of violence that Lenore Walker presented us with using some of the work of my colleague, Kendall Evans. Kendall Evans is the clinical director of "Another Way" which is the batterer treatment program in Los Angeles, California. Umm… and he has a many, many years of experience in working with batterers. He was involved in developing standards for the… for batterer intervention programs in Los Angeles County. But in working with batterers, he observed that… as I mentioned that is cycle of violence did not capture. The phenomenological experience of a batterer, instead he purposes when he calls "cycle of feeling avoidance", and it goes something like this. Tension is something we all experience, every one of us. It is how we deal with the tension that makes a difference. For batterers, oftentimes, the tension is about unresolved feelings from the past. Those unresolved feelings are what I called the "little feelings". They may include feeling of shame, of guilt, of fear, of abandonment. Many batterers, however, have gotten very good at defending against these feelings. Many batterers, in fact, do not even feel those feelings. They defend against their feelings in one of a number of ways. They are passive and there are active defenses. Passive defenses might include such things as rationalization, manipulation, intellectualization. Active feelings might include such things as drug use, alcohol use, search for excitement and high risk behavior

MICHELE HARWAY And battering. Now, part of what Evans speculates happens is something in the real life that… today's life sets off an unresolved feeling from the past. It gets defended against. Let's say that it gets defended against by some kind of an active defense. Umm… that active defense is anger, umm… transforming the partner into the enemy, and because most of us are trained to defense against an enemy, to attack the enemy, umm… battering is then the outcome. In that moment, the partner is seen as an enemy and the batterer, the batterer's survival feels like it's at stake. And so he lashes out to save himself, to protect himself. But of course, as soon as the explosion, the battering act is over, he's left with evidence of having hurt the person that he loves. In fact, most abusive partners very much do love the ones that they hurt. So they are left with the knowledge that they have hurt somebody they love, and that that person is angry at them. And so in that moment, they have to make for it, they have to atone for it. So we do going to the honeymoon cycle even in the cycle of feeling avoidance, but what has happened is that the battering act has in fact contributed additional problems to whatever is going on. So the battering act itself both serves as a release against the unresolved feelings of the past, but in fact, contributes to an increase in the tension, as it creates additional problems. Umm… one of the nice things about this particular model, umm… is that it has some vocations for treatment. It also shows the co-existence of drug and alcohol use and violence. Umm… there is much, much evidence in the literature that these… that substance abuse and violence do go together. According to this theory at least, it may be that they both serve the same function, and that's why they tend to come together. Umm… there is a evidence however that if somebody uses drugs and alcohol, umm… that if they are go into some kind of program for drug and alcohol, some kind of drug and alcohol treatment program, that they're likely to, to continue to violent, if the battery in not intervened with. So both of the problems have got to be addressed, a single one cannot be addressed. Umm… obviously, this is, this is a psycho-dynamic model, umm… It's important to state that while I have being talking as if all batterers are alike, we know that that's not true, that there is not a single batterer. However this model is very effective with a great number of the batterers that do find themselves in treatment. But treatment is not appropriate for every single batterer, it's important to say that. I'd like to introduce you to another couple. This is not a couple that I… You know, that I have written about. It actually is something that's cited in a book by Island and Letellier. And it's called the "Carrots(ph) Incident". I am going to read it to you. Steven and I are in our kitchen in the Castro in San Francisco cooking dinner. The music is on, the windows are open and we are chatting and bopping around. It's an average day. Steven trying to me and says, "Patrick, will you cut the carrots?" And I say, "Sure, how do you want them?" Steven answers, "Oh, any way. It doesn't matter." I continue my talking and dancing and the carrots are cut and I'm ready to do whatever is next, the tomatoes, the chicken. Steven is suddenly angry. "Oh, honestly. Look at these," he shouts. "These are no good." He is clinching his fists. "I can't believe you!" he shouts. "What I am supposed to do with these?" It's the carrots. He doesn't like the way the carrots are cut. "Steven, you said it didn't matter how I cut them. They are fine." Steven shouts back. "I will tell you they are not fine.'' With the one swipe of his hand, the carrots are off the cutting board and onto the floor. "Oh, Steven, come on. Why'd you do that for?" "Don't tell me to come on, do you hear?" Pow, a fist on the side of my head. Pow, another fist, this one in the rips. I pushed up against the wall. Again, he yells, "Don't tell me to come on!" I shout, "Get off me, you fucker." And I push him away, livid. He pummels me in head, in the face, in the chest. I am thrown against the wall again. I run out of the room terrified, angry, shocked, sad. "What did I do? Why did this is happen? What am I doing wrong?" I run into the bedroom. Steven stays behind to clean up the carrots and to continue cooking. He comes into the bathroom ten minutes later. We're shirtless. I'm washing my face and neck and chest. "Let me see," he says, gently taking my chin in his hand and turning my face towards his. He eyes my cut lip and some marks on my neck and chest. I am still shaking. I start crying. Steven says, "Oh, my darling. How can I do this to you? I love you so much. Come here." And he hugs me and rocks me as I cry. "You've got to help me, Patrick. I don't like hitting you." Here, we have seen the whole cycle. We have seen something happening. What has happened? Patrick has cut the carrots wrong. Is he really angry about the carrots? Well, not really. But he is angry about what the carrots symbolize. Because if Patrick truly loved him, he would intuitively know how to cut the carrots. Remember that Patrick asked Steven how he wanted the carrots cut, and Steven said any and all way. He didn't really mean that. He meant, "You know how I like them. And if you love me, you will know what to do." And the anger is about… now this is all happening in a nano-second, and I am sure it's not being processed, but certainly what appears to me to be going on is in that moment, Steven feels that he's being emotionally abandoned. Because if Patrick truly loved him, he would have cut the carrots correctly. And in that moment, umm… he goes to a defense against that feeling, 'cause it's too painful. Umm… and he sees Patrick in that moment as his enemy. He is immediately transformed from his loving partner, they're having fun, dancing, and it's a beautiful day and, you know, whatever they are doing in the kitchen. He is immediately transformed from that situation to an enemy, and an enemy has to be, has to be beaten. But of course, as soon as he does that, he is immediately struck with remorse. This is somebody he loves. So once he has discharged the energy that it is caused by his momentary feeling of abandonment, he is once again both remorseful about what he is done to his partner, feeling terribly guilty and trying to atone for it. And I also want to point out that Patrick, in that moment, is questioning himself as to what it is that he did wrong. And that's also very common in cases of battering. I'm going to make what may feel like somewhat of an abrupt transition, because what I have been trying to build to is talking about making an assessment. And unless you have clients who are court referred, you will not know that there's. And that is because batterers will never come and tell you that they have been violent, because they truly believe that they're not at fault. I am sure that if Steven and Patrick were to enter your office, and if they were to describe this fight that they had, Steven truly feels that Patrick did this to him, umm… even though he is the one that used his fist and beat Patrick up. Umm… so it's unlikely that Steven will come in and tell you that he has been violent. Patrick, on the other hand, feels responsible to a certain extent for the violence. He feels a great deal of shame himself for having done whatever it was that he did that brought along the violence. And so he is unlikely to volunteer that there is violence in the relationship. There is also some empirical information which suggests that when couples come in for marital counseling, and where there has been violence, that they seldom will mention the violence themselves, because they don't consider the violence the real problem. The violence is something that's seen as unstable and infrequent and secondary to other problems. When we think about a relationship, the relationship encompasses many days and many other changes. And if in fact the cycle of violence happens even every other day, that still leaves a… in most cases in which there's violence… there's violence, the cycle of violence may take a week, it may take a month, it may take a year to go all the way through the cycle. But even in a case where violence happens every other day, there is still many, many, many inner changes that occur between the couple that doesn't fit in the cycle of violence. So that couple is less likely to see the violence as the primary problem. What is the problem is the argument. It is the disrespect, or whatever it is that they have decided in their brain is the problem in that particular relationship. The most important thing for you to remember, from my perspective at least, from this tape, is how important it is for you to ask questions to find that about violence. And I have a specific protocol that I am going to introduce you to to guide you in asking the right questions, because as you might imagine, simply asking, "Are you a batterer or have you been battered," is not going to yield you what you want. Lenore Walker has talked about the presentation of battered women as being a presentation which is very consistent with post traumatic stress disorder. So some of the thing that a battered woman might present with depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse, suicidality, intrusive thoughts, somatization, hypervigilence, victimization of others. And of course, many clients who come in for individual therapy, present with one or more of these symptoms. So the fact that somebody comes in presenting with these symptoms, does not necessarily mean that she has in fact been battered. But I simply give you this information to suggest that there may in fact be individual clients who've presented with these symptoms who may have been battered, whose symptoms may well be the consequence of a long time history of being in an abusive relationship. I am going to talk first about doing an assessment when a couple presents for a couples therapy. Umm… the typical situation that I encountered is the following. The phone rings. I pick up the phone. It's usually the woman on the phone. And she tells me that she'd like to come in for couples counseling because, "My husband and I are having a communication problems." Very often the communication problems, of course, you are hiding something a little bit nastier than that. What I usually tell her on the telephone at that moment is how my intake is going to proceed. I let her know that in the intake, it is unlikely that we will be able to address directly the problem that has caused her to pick up the telephone to call me that day. Umm… that we are going to have at least one session, perhaps two, in which we're going to do an intake, and that point, we will decide together what the appropriate course treatment is. Notice that I'm not committing myself to treating the case, but I am simply committing myself to doing an intake. And I am letting her know that right from the get go. I also let her know that there will be three parts to that intake. Part number one, I tell her that she and her partner will be coming into my office and that I will be spending a very short period of time with them together. Then I let her know that I will spend some time with her alone, then I will spend some time with him alone. That's the second part of my intake. And the third part of the intake is I will bring the two of them back together in my office, and we'll discuss what the treatment options are, if indeed I've managed to get through the entire intake in that one session. Remember that I have left it open to having the possibility of a second intake session. I said things happen this way because it's particularly important that I have some time alone, umm… with each member of the couple. It's extremely unlikely, as I've mentioned, that either of them is going to volunteer information about the abuse. And I really… in fairness to them, should not be eliciting that information when they are together in the room. Because if I do, if let's sat she tells me when the two of them are together in the room, that he's been violent, that's likely to set off a violent episode when they leave my office. And so what I've done is I have in fact endangered her by asking the question in his presence. I am going to refrain from asking those kinds of questions until each of them is along. You know, I'll walk you through what it is that I am doing. When the two of them are in my office, I am looking for certain things. I am looking fear. Fear is the single best indicator that there has been some abuse or violence in that relationship. So I am looking to see how they interact. I am looking to see whether either or both of them minimize things. Again, often minimization accompanies battering and is fairly tell-tale. I am looking for something involving their conflict resolution strategies. Uh… depending on how long I spend with the two of them together, I may or may not see that, and then may want to reserve that for my time alone with them. But what I am essentially looking for is whether they think in win-lose lose or in win-win terms. Do I have some sense that the resolution of their conflicts requires one person to emotionally overpower or control the other? Is there any kind of pattern for attempting to control of overpower the other? And also very important, do I feel controlled by the client? Batterers can be extremely charming. But often, if they are abusive in their primary relationships, they are also abusive in other parts of their life, and they are likely… I didn't mean to say abusive, I meant to say controlling… if they are controlling in their primary relationship, they are also controlling in other parts of their life. And they are likely to be controlling even with me, the therapist. So I look to see whether I feel that the client is… one of the clients is trying to control the session. Other things that I'd be looking for, not necessarily when the two of them are in my office but when a single one is there, I am looking for instances of isolation, I am looking for one person blaming all things on the other. Often batterers do blame their partners for all the things that go wrong. I am looking to see whether one person is willing to hurt the other one to win. So what cost are they willing to win the, you know, the interaction. Is there evidence of self righteousness or knowing "the right answer", or "the right way"? Is there lack of empathy for the partner? Batterers often have a very difficult time demonstrating empathy. When they first come into my office, I reiterate what it is that I plan to do during the intake. Because I've already told her on the phone, she may or may not have told him. And I want him to be equally aware of the fact that we are not going to be resolving the issue that has brought them into therapy today, and that in fact, the intake will be split up in the way that I have just described. Umm… I am going to play the odds, in the sense that since it's most likely that if there is abuse, he is likely to be the abusive one and she is likely to be the abused one, that means that I am going to set things up such that I see her individually first, followed by seeing him individually. I have a more of a problem if I am seeing a same sex couple, because it's… I don't have any odds to go on. So I am going to have to use my observational powers during the first part of the intake to try to figure out, who if there is an abuser, who is most likely to be abusive and set things up so that I see that person second. Umm… the reason that I see the abuser second is at the end of my time alone with each of them, I need for him to have acknowledged that even at some minimal level, that he has been abusive towards his partner. And I am most likely to get to that point if I've talked first with the victim, because she is more likely to give me information about the abuse. And armed with that, I'll be more successful in getting him to admit to having been abusive. I describe the process of asking the questions as using the freeze-frame approach. And I ask her to talk about a recent disagreement that they've had or the worst disagreement they've had or the last agreement they've had, and I ask her to tell me in, in excruciating detail what has happened. I found that if I don't do that, the story that I am likely to get will be something like this. "It was Tuesday, I'd had a bad day at work. And I came home and George was very upset with me. I had told him I wanted to buy a new couch. He really didn't want to buy a new couch. And so we argued, and I didn't buy a new couch." And with that particular story, I have no sense of what the interaction looked like. Now, take the same situation described to me with a freeze-frame approach, which I am going to have to train her to tell me about. "It was Tuesday, I'd had a bad day at work, I came home, George was angry at me, I had wanted to buy a new couch." "George was angry at you? Well, slow down a second." I will say to her. "So what happened, what did he say?" "Okay, and what did you say and then what did he say?" "Oh, and then what did you say, or what did he do, what did you do?" By doing that I begin to get the details of what actually happened. George first might have accused her of spending all the family money on nonsense. She might have retorted in some angry or submissive way, it doesn't matter. He might have then escalated. And by using the freeze-frame approach, I get the escalation of the violence, and the fact that eventually he begins to push her, hit her and so forth. So I ask for the, umm… the interaction. I ask what happens, what he says the next, what she says the next, what she says the next, what he says, what he does next. And usually by then, I have a very pretty good picture of whether or not there's been violence. If for some reason, however, that has not yielded me very much information, I might ask her whether she's ever felt afraid. You might remember at the earlier on I mentioned that fear is a very tell-tale sign of violence. So if she says to me, "Yes, you know, I am afraid of him. I have been afraid of him." Then I ask her to recount for me the conditions under which she's been afraid, and then I will go into my freeze-frame approach and say, "Okay, what did he say? What did you say, what did he do, what did you do?" And slow the action down until I get a description of a violent act, if in fact one occurred. The question has to be framed more like, "Has there ever been pushing? Has there ever been shoving? Has… Have you slapped or been slapped? Have you hit or been hit? Have you kicked or been kicked? Have things been thrown or broken? Have there been injuries?" But the specific violent behaviors may need to be numerated one at a time to get an exact example of what has happened. Let's say that in the middle of this set of questions, that there was absolutely no evidence of violence. Everything she tells me seems like a normal relationship, with or without conflict. At that point, I would, you know, spend a little time with him because I have said I will, just to find out whether from his perspective… because there is always the possibility that she in fact is the batterer and he is the battered one, but I would spend some time with him to find out from his perspective whether conflict is indeed resolved the way she has described it, and if that's so, then when I bring the two of them back together into the room, we'll talk about ongoing couple's therapy to resolve the issues that are there. If on the other hand, in that process, I find out from her that there has in fact been violence, I have both an ethical responsibility to give her some very quick information to keep her safe, usually that will consist of some information about contacting some of the domestic violence programs. This has to be done orally, I cannot take the risk of giving her written material, which he may then see and use as a reason to beat her up. Give her a few… a few hints on how to keep herself safe in, umm… in the case of another violent act. Then I move to having him come in the room. And the questions that I asked him are exactly the same, using the same freeze-frame, umm… approach. The only difference in my questions to him, in contrast to my questions to her, if indeed she has told me that there's been violence, is to ask him whether his partner has ever felt afraid. And if the answer is yes, I will say, "Why do you think that is?" Because oftentimes, while he maybe unwilling to admit to any kind of violent act, he will be willing to admit to his partner having been afraid. And when we use the freeze-frame method to break that down, that's when he will tell me that he maybe sort of kind of push her a little. And that's all the information I need. I need for him to admit if there's been violence. I need for him to tell me that he has participated in that violence, that he's been in fact the perpetrator of that violence, even if he is minimized that it is only about this big. It's very, very important that the admission come from his lips, because I cannot want to bring them back together if he has not acknowledged the violence. I cannot say, "Your wife or your girlfriend told me that this violence occurred." Because of course, then I am endangering her. So it's important that I get him to admit to having participated at… even at a very minimal level in the violence. Once that has happened and I am able to bring them back together, umm… then we can talk about what the… what the treatment is. And usually what I will say to them at that point is, you know, "George, you told when I was talking with you alone, that last Tuesday that is, you and Susan had an argument about buying a new couch, that you pushed her a little. And you're concerned about that, you know. She is afraid of you, you are concerned about that. I know that you care very much about Susan. Here is my recommendation, umm… my recommendation is that it would be premature at this time for us to work on the couple's issues…" And I will come back to talk about that with, with the listener in a few minutes. "But instead what I recommend, George, is I have a colleague who has a wonderful group for man who have similar issues. And I'd very much like for you to attend that group." Notice that I don't use the word violence, battering, abuse or anything else that might be a red flag. I suspect that George is very sensitive about this issue, umm… even with the way that I am presenting it, the likelihood that they will follow through on my recommendations are not very good. But I certainly want to increase the likelihood that they may indeed follow on that recommendation. And I know that if I mention violence or abuse or battering or anything like that, anger management, or anything like that, that George is unlikely to follow through my recommendation. So instead I talk about a group of men who have similar issues. And then I turn to Susan and say, "Susan, you know, when you and I talked, it was very clear to me that you also have some issues that you need to resolve. And then when the two of you have done this individual work, then I would like to recommend that we get together and work on many of the couple's issues that you, you know, that you have talked about and you need to work on." The reason that at that point I would not do couple's therapy is most court mandated cases are sent to situations where the treatment can be done in a group modality for the batterer. But in addition to that, there is some evidence that as long as the violence is a large part of what is happening between the couple, that couple's therapy is in fact not going to be a very effective treatment modality. If you think about the fact that in couples therapy, we are going to be examining a number of different couple's issues where conflict resolution has been dealt with in a violent manner. It's likely that as we bring up additional issues that are problematic between the couple, that those might in fact be resolved through violent means. And so those things need to be dealt with, but they need to be dealt with after the perpetrator has learned other ways to deal with, with conflict, other than the one that he has used. There is also some evidence from the longitudinal study of couples that John Gottman and his colleagues at the University of Washington have done, that the batterer's behavior is completely independent of the battered women's behavior. And just a very quick little anecdote, when John Gottman and his colleagues were studying the sub-sample of couples in their study who had, umm… used violence, they asked those couples to come into the laboratory. And they were being observed through a one-way mirror. They also were, umm… hooked up to a variety of electrophysiological measures, and they… I asked them to repeat an argument that they had been having. Not to use violence, but to begin to discuss where they had left off. And they observed the couples. And one of the things that they noticed is that independently of what she did, if she nagged, if she was submissive or passive or active, that her behaviors were completely unrelated to his behaviors. When he became to be controlling and abusive, it was completely independent of what she did. And if that's true, then that suggests that in a couple's modality, if you are working with the couple and trying to train them to work better with each other so they might resolve the conflict differently, umm… you'll be unsuccessful in training her to do anything differently. Or more importantly, even if you train her to do something differently, it's not going to have an impact on his behavior. Many of us believe that batterer's treatment must be done with the batterer first, that he must learn how to deal with his controlling and aggressive impulses, and in the cases of the cycle of feeling avoidance, he must learn to deal with his feelings in a different way. I haven't talked much about what I recommend for her. When I do bring them back, I do recommend that she go into treatment. Umm… treatment of choice would really be both individual therapy and a support group with other battered women. However, because my goal is to get him to treatment group, umm… if you get her some support, I don't want to mention anything about being in a support group for battered women at that moment. I am hoping that by referring her to a therapist, umm… who is trained in this area, and I will give her names of people who are, that that therapist in the course of the individual treatment, will also refer her to a group. Groups are very, umm… a very good, uh… adjunctive treatment modalities for somebody who… who's been in an abusive relationship. It's very helpful to see other women who are at different phages of recovery. I'd very much like to thank you for your attention. I am going to be leaving a list of resources for you. Umm… I have some referral groups, umm… there are a number of reading materials that I might suggest. Umm… for those of you who are interested in a more academic book, we recommend, umm… this book that I added to with Jim O'Neil called "What Causes Men's Violence Against Women?" which was published in 1999 by Sage Publications. And I've already mentioned the spouse of this book, there is a new edition coming out that Professional Resource Press would be publishing. I am also going to be giving you number of other resources, might mention a few of them, Donald Dutton's book, "The Batterer" is a wonderful resource to understand some of the dynamics of the batterer. Lenore Walker's book "The Battered Woman" is a wonderful educational piece if you are working with women who have been abused, it really helps them understand how the experiences they have had is very consistent with that of other abused women. I am going to give information regarding gay and lesbian domestic violence. There are a couple of books on that. Umm… so I will list some, umm… some reference books and some resources for referrals for clients that you might have that are affected by this problem. And I thank for your attention.
