00:00:20
What is Choice Theory? 

00:00:20
BANNING K. LARY Choice theory developed by psychiatrist William Glasser is an explanation for human behaviour based on internal motivation.

Choice Theory evolved from Control Theory

William Glasser, MD 

00:00:30
1925 - 2013 

00:00:30
BOB WUBBOLDING It's what we call an internal control psychology, so we are really, we have control, more control over our lives than we think we are by making choices and that's why it's called Choice Theory. It originally was called Control Theory r control system theory and William Glasser changed the name of it because he put a lot of emphasis on the word choice. 

00:00:50
BANNING K. LARY Choice theory infers that all behaviour is genetically driven in the attempt to satisfy five basic needs, common to all human beings. 

00:01:00
BOB WUBBOLDING It's based on the idea that we choose our behaviour and, that these choices originate in five sources current sources. 

00:01:10
BANNING K. LARY Choice theory asserts that our five basic needs are Hard-wired into our genetic structure, and everything we do is motivated to satisfying one or more of these needs 1. Physical survival, the physiological need includes food, shelter, safety, and the urge to reproduce 2. Love and Belonging, the psychological need manifests in personal relationships, social connections being part of a group and having at least one intimate person with which to share love and affection 3. Power or self-efficacy, the psychological need can be said to be rooted in the desire to become skilled or competent to be recognized for achievement and there by establishing confidence and self-worth 4. Freedom or Independence, the psychological need views autonomy is essential to making choices, which control the direction of one's life 5. Fun or Learning, the need for fun is expressed through laughter, pleasure and enjoyment participation in sports or games, going out to dinner or traveling or exploring new places. Especially, as they promote learning and developing knowledge in life skills.

PRACTICING REALITY THERAPIST 

00:02:25
DAVID REBER All of our behaviours are generated in order to either meet those needs uh…and to increase pleasure which is associated with beating those leaves or to decrease just comfort which is uh…any state in which those needs are not met or we are prevented from being met. 

00:02:45
BANNING K. LARY The choice theory model is used in reality therapy to help clients self-evaluate and gain more control of their lives by making effective choices, choices he describes how a person can move from being externally controlled, to being internally controlled, and thus gain power over his or her life experience, while working in schools and prisons the1950's and 60's, Dr Glasser realized many prevailing types of external control psychology, failed to produce positive behavioral changes instead they served only to punish or disconnect people, from meaningful personal relationships, Dr Glasser found this disconnectedness to be the source of what is called mental illness. Another social problems, such as drug addiction, violence, crime, school failure, abuse and suicide. Choice Theory draws from the work of Abraham Maslow, Albert Ellis and other pioneers in humanists psychology, who are able to improve human thinking and behaviour more successfully than the stimulus response models employed by Watson and Skinner.

00:03:55
WILLIAM GLASSER Mental health can be taught to anyone, who is capable of learning. And choice theory, that could be taught to anyone, who is capable of understanding what a choice is, because all through our lives we make choices, and as we make choices, we make choices that help us get along with people in our lives, and we make choices that harm us, as we harm our the relationship of people in our lives. 

00:04:25
BANNING K. LARY During his 50 years of psychiatric practice Dr. Glasser found that all unhappy people have the same problem, they are unable to have good relationships with the people, they wanted to have good relationships with. He also found that miserable people, often blamed others for causing their misery, instead of accepting personal responsibility. 

00:04:50
DIAGNOSIS:Unhappiness

00:04:50
CARLEEN GLASSER That's true as the major diagnosis in the DSM-IV should be Unhappiness, that's what he said is, is the major problem with anyone, who showing some kind of sign or symptoms of physical pain, emotional pain whatever kind of pain people were in it, it's mostly caused by unhappiness. And unhappiness is cause for the most part because people are in relationships that are not made satisfied, and these relationships would could be with you know, their children, they could be with their spouse, they could be with themselves, they're not in a good relationship with themselves be careful that you, you easy on yourself but take responsibility for the choices you make and he took the word responsibility and actually translated it into the word choice because he said if it's a choice it's your responsibility. 

00:05:45
BANNING K. LARY There are ten basic axioms, or essential premises on which choice theory is based. 1. The only person whose behavior we can control is our own. 2. All we can give another person is information. 3. All long-lasting psychological problems are relationship problems. 4. The problem relationship is always part of our present life. 5. What happened in the past has everything to do with what we are today, but we can only satisfy… …our basic needs right now, and plan to continue satisfying them in the future. 6. We can only satisfy our needs by satisfying pictures in our quality world. 7. All we do is behave. 8. All behavior is Total Behavior and is made up of four inseparable components acting, thinking, feeling and physiology. 9. All total behavior is chosen, but we only have direct control over the acting and thinking components. We can control our feeling and physiology indirectly through how we choose to act and think. 10. All Total Behavior is designated by verbs and his named by the part that is the most recognizable. In Choice Theory Dr. Glasser uses the example of depression, he would say I am choosing to depress or I am depressing instead of I am suffering from depression or I am depressed. This removes the external control from the situation and places the responsibility on the individual to employ internal control over his or her behavior.

ROBYN ROGERS It's sort of like you can really reinvent yourself by just changing the way you look at the world, I mean it's like you come out in the morning and whether the sun shining or not you say to yourself today is gonna be a great day, and then you do everything you can to make it a great day and by doing that cognitively you actually probably will end up having a better day. 

00:07:55
BANNING K. LARY The concepts of choice theory are summarized in the how the brain works diagram which depicts how a person perceives responds and interacts with people, and events in the external environment. The Real World is made up of everything which occurs in time and space, that which we perceive and everything else we cannot possibly perceive, because of the sheer quantity of the phenomena, to make personal sense of the world, we have filters which screen and limit information received, so we can utilize it without becoming overwhelmed. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN And not all the real world information comes then obviously because there are a lot of things that occur in the real world that we don't perceive we can't hear what dog hear or smell of other animals well and so we don't get all the information, and some of this kind of blocked out and it goes through then this Total knowledge filter. 

00:08:50
BANNING K. LARY Once we acquire information from our senses, sight, smell, taste, hearing in touch. It first passes through our total knowledge filter, which contains everything we know or have experienced in life, where 1. We decide the information is not meaningful to us, and the perception stops there. 2. We do not immediately recognize the information but believe it may be meaningful to us so we have some incentive to gain more information or 3. The information is meaningful to us and therefore passes through to the next filter. 

00:09:30
DAVID REBER We think about the idea of the sky is blue. Well, is that good or bad well it depends if you want to go on a picnic with your sweetheart in the afternoon is probably a good thing, but if you're a farmer or have been a grout for six months and your crops are drying up and there's no clouds in the sky you think it's a bad thing, but in reality it's neither worst it's just information. 

00:09:55
BANNING K. LARY In the valuing filter you place one or three values on the information, if it is needs satisfied you place a positive value on it, if it hind our ability to meet our needs we place a negative value on it, if it neither helps us nor hinders us in meeting our needs, we may place little or no value on it, it remains neutral then what passes through our valuing filter becomes part of our perceived world. A person's perceived world is a subset of the real world comprised of sensory data, which is passed through the knowledge and valuing filters, no two people have identical perceived worlds. This is illustrated by the parable of the blind man and the elephant five blind men meet an elephant for the first time, and try to describe it to the others, it's flat and floppy says the blind man touching the elephant's ear. No, it's round and heavy says the man with his arms around the leg, it's like a tapered tube says the man holding the snout, it's thin and ropelike says the man grasping its tail. No, it's broad and wide says the fifth blind man his arms outstretched spanning the elephant's torso. 

00:11:10
DAVID REBER Then this information then receives a ballad of good, bad or neutral and it goes into our perceived the world, and this is where we sort of make this comparison, what are we perceiving that we are getting from the real world and does it meet our expectations according to what we think would be a quality world. 

00:11:35
BOB WUBBOLDING We say that somewhere in your mind, let's put it that way there is this collection of specific wants of, of things you think are important in life and we call it the quality world, because it everything in there has quality has it's satisfying that's what that means, it's satisfying to our needs so the best way to think of that is uh…a collection of pictures, that we have inside of us that we really intensely desire not just whimsical things like, we want to stay alive and we want to have control in our life, we want to be free of the excess uh, outside coercion. 

00:12:10
BANNING K. LARY A person's quality world is comprised of pictures people places things, activities, ideas and belief systems, which he or she perceives as being need for feeling and thus direct one's behavior. These pictures relate to past experiences future aims or ambitions, and represent our idealized selves. These pictures can vary in levels of intensity or in the possibility of a attainment, such as the personal goal of becoming a doctor or having a family, building a vacation home or even winning an Oscar, pictures in our quality world changes or needs change as we go through life, in infants quality a world would only contain a picture of the parents, the source of all their need satisfaction. Notice how the size and span of the images can vary how one picture can fill one or more basic need. 

00:13:05
CARLEEN GLASSER It's just a simple uh…feedback loop of the real world and your quality world, and what you're seeing, your brain perceives is the difference between what you want in your quality world in comparison to what's in the real world and if they match, you're happy, and you keep going along your merry way, but many times we look at, at the real what we perceive the world around us and ourselves being in it. And we see something that does not match the picture in our head, and that picture in our head is our quality world, and the quality world drives behavior, because it represents everything we really, really, really want and so when the, the world out there doesn't matter the people or the things their job or whatever it is doesn't match that picture in our quality world where unhappy. 

00:14:00
BANNING K. LARY This acknowledges Glasser observation, the quality worlds are not always comprised of pictures others might ethically, legally or morally judge as being right. "A lot of people have not found anyone they can trust and enjoy being with. They may have been rejected or abused… to feel good they begin to replace people pictures with non-people pleasure pictures, pictures of violence, drugs and unloving sex… As they do so, they separate themselves further from people and happiness compounding the urgency of their problem." In other words people who cannot fulfilled their needs in ways society regards as being healthy and positive, may turn to negative and destructive activities to get their needs met, this is where aberration begins psychologists, counsellors another helping professionals often use a person's quality world as a starting place, to help the client self evaluate and make choices which move the person from where they are, to where they want to be. 

00:15:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Bill put scales on the chart are scales or out of balance we, we feel a strong urge to behave that's a frustration signal, and what, and how we behave is with total behavior we act, we think, we feel and we have physiology and so it's like the four wheels of a car, and that car, is the car of life, it's driving down the road of the real world, and when we're driving down that Real World Road we can turn down this road to happiness and make choices that will help us where we can go down the road to unhappiness, and that's what the woman in the prison was doing she was continually doing things taking the road the direction of, of choices and behaviors that hurt her. 

00:15:55
BANNING K. LARY As we experience life we are constantly comparing what we want our quality world pictures with what we've got our perceived world, when the two match fairly well we feel good, when there is a mismatch. If you're a degree of frustration depending upon the importance of the quality will picture and one's distance from achieving it. Choice Theory views that frustration signal as an urge to behave in a way that will help us get more of what we want. 

00:16:20
DAVID REBER The frustration signal is perceived by how we feel physically and emotionally, and then that alerts us to… A drive to change what we're thinking in doing it which is where we have our control the front wheels are like connected to the steering wheel of a car and that's our control system, the back wheels act a sort of a guidance system, that tells us whether or not what we're thinking in doing and working. 

00:16:50
BANNING K. LARY Choice serious search all behaviors purposeful. The behaviors are best attempt at a certain place and time using available resources to meet our five basic needs are behaviors an attempt at making the real world conform to the pictures in our quality world. Generally, we employ "organized behaviors," or those which have worked for us in the past. When these known behaviors are no longer effective, we have the ability to "reorganize," or create new behaviors. 

00:17:20
ROBYN ROGERS If you change your behavior your thoughts will eventually go along with it as well your feelings and physiology, if you can decide that you're going to stop smoking, but that action that you have to take, thinking about it won't make you stop smoking, you'll stop smoking because when you see that cigarette you'll choose not to pick it up unlighted. 

00:17:45
CARLEEN GLASSER When you're counseling someone focus on the front wheels of the car help people come from that feeling physiology, I feel bad, I feel sick, I feel you know miserable I'm anxious, I'm angry whatever the feeling is whether it's physical or emotional, they mostly come and then present with that those, those complaints, and what we are asking them to doing in reality therapy and counseling with Choice Theory is focused on what are you doing now. And what can you think perhaps that, they you could do differently, that will help you to get more of what you mean rather than keep you from getting what you need. 

00:18:30
BANNING K. LARY A major key to mental health and life satisfaction is getting along with other people, Glasser has identified 7 disconnecting habits, which destroy relationships and 7 connecting habits which support relationships, the 7 disconnecting habits are criticizing, blaming, complaining, nagging, threatening, punishing and bribing to control the 7 connecting habits are supporting, encouraging, listening, accepting, trusting, respecting and negotiation. 

00:19:05
BOB WUBBOLDING The essential question though is, is what you're doing bringing you closer or further away from the people around you, that would be the bottom fundamental bottom line type of self evaluation, is that is what you're doing helping your relationships or not and this has many, many nuances and extensions to it, is what you're doing getting you what you want is what you're doing uh…in a school in a classroom is it helping you learn is it helping other people learn, that helping the teacher teach uh…and then the teacher in a classroom asked, can I ask the same question is what I'm doing, getting me more connected or more disconnected to these students. 

00:19:50
BANNING K. LARY Principles of choice theory are being used effectively in schools, to allow students greater autonomy in learning, while promoting positive relationships to create shared visions, implementing choice theory in the classroom has been shown on to increase internal motivation and curriculum outcomes while decreasing behavioral problems, lead management first developed by W. Edwards Deming then later explained and redefined by Dr. William Glasser is the application of choice theory principles to any situation, where one's responsibility is to manage others, leave management relies on intrinsic motivation and self-evaluation to facilitate communication, build trust and create quality work. This contrasts with additional boss management which relies on extrinsic motivation through the application of coercive techniques, and various forms of punishment. Choice Theory is the basis for reality therapy where clients are guided to self evaluate and find their own answers to their life's problems, reality therapy is non-judgemental, and focuses on present circumstances. The goal being to empower the client to reconnect with other people, and develop a workable plan to get what they want out of life. When Dr. Glasser died in 2013, over 84,000 people around the world who had participated in seminars on choice theory and reality therapy, with over 10,000 becoming certified today these practitioners work in the helping professions in all areas of society, from school counseling to prisons from alcohol and drug abuse to management and executive coaching, they work in private practice and on staff in institutions, corporations and in government agencies such as those providing social services. Over the past several decades Dr. Glasser is work in choice theory and reality therapy has been researched or referenced in hundreds of articles, published in peer reviewed scientific journals, these studies have addressed the full range of mental health issues, from attachment theory to adolescent problems and classroom management, from family counseling to increasing educational outcomes, from drug addiction to mindfulness from athletic coaching to personal wealth management, in short the choice theory model has been proven to work for anyone, anywhere who has a sincere working desire to improve his or her life experience, throughout his life Dr. Glasser was a prolific researcher and author, who disseminated his findings on the efficacy of the Choice Theory, reality therapy approach to mental health in over 35 books. And for others he co-authored with his wife and partner Carleen Glasser. 

00:22:45
WILLIAM GLASSER But what I try to offer, and all the people I work with in the William Glasser institute, what we do is teach people how to live their lives, and get along well with the important people in their lives, without attempting to control them or change the way they were live or doing anything like that.
