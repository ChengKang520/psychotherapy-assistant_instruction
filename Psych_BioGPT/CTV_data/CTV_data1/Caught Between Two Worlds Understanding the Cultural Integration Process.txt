GEORGE GUSHUE It's my pleasure and honor, I'm George Gushue. I'm a member of the faculty in the counseling program here at Teachers College. And it's my great pleasure to introduce our next speaker to you. Let me tell you a little bit about Doctor Fuentes. Doctor Milton Fuentes received his M.A. in psychology with a focus on Latina/Latino psychology from Montclair State University and his Psy.D. in clinical psychology from the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology at Rutgers. He completed a pre-doctoral fellowship in clinical and community psychology at Yale University and post-doctoral training in epidemiology at Columbia University, uptown at 168th Street. He's currently professor and chair of the Clinical Psychology Department at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology, D.C. Campus. He's also a licensed psychologist in New Jersey and New York as well as the Director of the Clinical and Community Studies Laboratory. He's a founding member and former president of the Latino Psychological Association of New Jersey and the 2012 President of the national Latino/Latina Psychological Association. Doctor Fuentes' interests are in the areas of Latina/Latino and multicultural psychology, child and family psychology and pedagogy. He serves as a consultant to several community based programs including the Puerto Rican Family Institute. So it is a real pleasure to be able to welcome you. And I give you Doctor Milton Fuentes.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Migration patterns U.S. Department of Homeland Security (2010) Latin America. Africa. the Caribbean and the Middle East Factors that facilitate or impede the cultural integration or bicultural process? Role of Skin Tone? Evidence for the Multidimensionality Model? 

00:02:20
ACCULTURATION "The process that takes place as a result of contact with culturally dissimilar people, groups or social influences" - (p. 227, Gibson 2001, as cited in Schwartz et al, 2010) Models of Acculturation Unidimensional Model (Gibson, 1964) Bidimensional Model (Berry, 1980) Multidimensional Model (Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, and Szapocznik, 2010) 

00:02:20
Unidimensional Model (Gibson, 1964) Bidimensional Model Berry, 1980) suggests that immigrants have their own unique translocation and acculturative process, often questioning: Which aspects of their culture of origin/heritage they should maintain? Which aspects they should discard? And Which aspects of the new host culture they should adopt and which aspects they should disregard? 

00:02:20
BIDIMENSIONAL MODEL While the acculturation experts agree that the acculturative process is complicated, Berry (1980) suggests that individuals typically fall into one of the four following categories: Assimilation (Immigration Paradox) Separation Integration Marginalization Transcultural identity (Comas-Diaz, 2012) 

00:02:20
BICULTURALISM Integration or biculturalism is correlated with positive adjustment and favorable psychological outcomes Better adjustment self-esteem Lower depression Prosocial behaviors Cultural Role Switching 

00:02:20
MULTIDIMENSIONALITY MODEL Cultural Practices (language use, media preferences, social affiliations, customs and traditions) Values (belief systems: collectivism vs. individualism) Identifications (attachment to cultural groups and the esteem drawn from them) 

00:02:20
MEDIATORS OF THE ACCULTURATIVE PROCESS Age of migration Children vs. adults Visible minority status Second-generation migrants Skin Tone Ethnic Enclaves (Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, and Szaporczak, 2010) 

00:02:20
ROLE OF SKIN TONE Participants with darker skin reported higher levels of race-related stress Participants with darker skin reported high levels of institutional, individual and cultural racism With Latinos Income was negatively correlated with perceived racism Participants who reported lower income levels tended to report higher levels of perceived racism S simultaneous multiple regression analysis found that skin color and income level significantly predicted perceived racism (Fuentes, et al., 2008) 

00:02:20
ACCULTURATION & ADAPTATION The process of immigration and acculturation can be paralyzing (Flores & Carey, 2000) Vega (1995) describes this struggle as being related to the loss of important social support networks. Lack of family support, income language Acceptance of traditional cultural values and practices Compromises many Latino immigrants' ability to effectively and efficiently adapt to their new surroundings (Castro, Barrera & Martinez, 2004) 

00:02:20
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The factors that facilitated or inhibited cultural integration in individuals who self-identified as being bicultural? Evidence for the Multidimensionality Model? Role of skin tone? 

00:02:25
MILTON FUENTES Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for being with me. So, according to the Department of Homeland Security a little over a million people will migrate to the United States each year. And as they come into this country they come with their culture of origin and they're going to connect with a whole new host culture. So the question becomes how is that going to play out. So this research became interested in that question. What are the factors that facilitate the cultural integration process and what are the factors that hinder the cultural integration process? We were also interested in the role that skin tone plays in the cultural integration process and we'll share some interesting findings we found there. And then, as you may have read in the American Psychologist a few years ago, a new model for understanding acculturation was unveiled, the Multidimensionality Model. And so we were looking for evidence to support this particular model. So that's what we're going to be focusing on over the next 50 minutes. So let's, I've thrown the word acculturation around a couple times, so let's just get a working definition out there. In terms of acculturation it's the process that takes place as a result of contact with culturally dissimilar people, groups or social influences. There have been three models that have been introduced to us around acculturation and understanding acculturation. The Unidimensional Model, the Bidimensional Model and now this new Multidimensionality Model. In terms of the Unidimensional Model, back in the mid-sixties the understanding was people arrived from another country, they shed their old identity. They took on this new identity. And that's how we understood acculturation. Fortunately Berry came along to help us further understand this phenomenon and introduced the Bidimensional Model. And this particular model suggests that immigrants have their own unique translocation and acculturative process, often questioning which aspects of their culture of origin they want to hold on to, which aspects they want to let go of. And as they encounter this new host culture, which aspects of this new host culture are they going to embrace? And which aspects are they going to dismiss or stay away from? And so this is a way of understanding the Bidimensional Model. Now while the experts recognize that this is a very complicated process, Berry suggests that people typically fall into one of these four quadrants: Assimilation, Separation, Integration, and Marginalization. The research that we're focusing on today is interested in the Integration process. And I'll explain to you why I became why I became kind of curious in that particular model. In terms of Assimilation, you know, I'm going to assume folks have kind of a working knowledge, but I'll just give you some quick and dirty in terms of these four quadrants. In terms of Assimilation, folks come over. They take on the new host culture. They drop they culture of origin and they just assimilate. It's the whole melting pot phenomenon that we've been introduced to. There's an interesting experience associated with assimilation and that's the Immigration Paradox. We have found that when folks come here, they tend to be healthier than over time. We have found that, for example with adolescents who come over from other countries, they tend to eat better. They tend to be more mobile. They tend to be more compliant with medications and treatment. However, over time those things start to shift and change. And what we find is the higher levels of psychiatric distress, illness, especially in the areas of substance abuse. So those are some of the things associated with Assimilation. In terms of Separation, folks come over. They don't want anything to do with the host culture and they just kind of hold on to their culture of origin, Separation. Integration is when folks kind of take on aspects of the new culture and hold on to aspects of the culture of origin. Cultural integration or biculturism. There's different terms that are used out there. And then Marginalization. The newer research is finding that this is a less prevalent phenomenon in terms of acculturation. There are less folks who are marginalized, especially, the way I'm coming to understand it is as we become more global and technology really advances, the ability to kind of connect with people across the world and maintain your identity has really increased. And so it's allowed for people not to feel marginalized. But if you can imagine maybe 25 years ago, 30 years ago, somebody coming from Guatemela making their way to Laramie, Wyoming. Right? Folks may not be as receptive to this particular person from Guatemala, so they're not invited into the new host culture. And they don't have fellow Guatemalans, or folks from Guatemala to kind of help support their culture of origin, so they become marginalized. That was the understanding back then. The research is showing fewer folks fall into that particular quadrant. For those folks who went to the National Latino Psych Association conference in 2012, which was held in New Jersey, we had the pleasure of listening to Lillian Comas-Diaz talk about some of this stuff. And she introduced this idea. She was kind of struggling with this thing of people coming over and identity and how it all plays out. And I think she wanted us to really appreciate that it's not additive or you subtract. It just doesn't work that way. To her it was more multiplicative and when all these things come together something new emerges, something transcultural emerges. And so she was suggesting that there is this transcultural identity, not just take away this, add a little bit of that. When you put all that together, it's like sancocho, if you appreciate sancocho, right? The stew that Puerto Ricans-, Puerto Ricans think they own it but Dominicans think they own it and Columbians think they own it. But when you take the parts of sancocho, you think about the chicken and the yuca and the this and that. It does no justice to what actually happens when sancocho starts to cook, right? And so that's what she was suggesting through this transcultural identity phenomenon. My research is interested in cultural integration because I'm bicultural and I became curious about those factors that facilitate my biculturalism. And so I started to look at the research behind it and we find that people who are bicultural or culturally integrated tend to have more favorable psychological and physical outcomes. We find that people who are culturally integrated have higher levels of self-esteem, lower levels of depression, pro-social behaviors because they can comfortably navigate these two new environments, right? I can go in and out of Latino spheres and U.S. American spheres comfortably, speak the language, eat the foods, know the code, if you will, within these spheres. Something that we've been talking about and calling cultural role switching, the ability to kind of go back and forth into these different spheres. The Multidimensionality Model, so we've looked at two, right, Unidimensional and Bidimensional. Now the Multidimensional Model that was introduced by Schwartz and his colleagues and released in the American Psychology in 2010, recognizes that acculturation's a pretty complicated process. There's a lot going on. The older models really focused on the first aspect here, cultural practices, things we can see, things we can observe. These folks really encouraged us to think about the values people bring into the picture, if you will, how those value inform their functioning, how those values inform their decisions. And then just because you speak Spanish and you eat the foods and you dance the dances doesn't mean you necessarily feel Puerto Rican or feel whatever it might be. And so do people identify with that? And do they draw esteem from it? When people say I'm Puerto Rican, is it something that they're afraid of, embarrassed of? Is it something that they embrace and get excited about? So what is their identification and do they draw esteem from it? And so these folks really kind of broadened our understanding of acculturation and really encouraged us to think about it in a more complex way, which I appreciate. We know that acculturation process is mediated by a number of factors. For example when people arrive right? If you arrive when you're a child you're going to have a very different experience than if you arrive as a teenager and if you arrive as an older adult. Some folks would argue that because children are a bit more kind of flexible and nimble, they have an easier time acculturating or taking on the new host culture. If somebody came over a bit older they might not have as easy of a time. When you come over, what do you look like and you able to kind of blend. If you're not able to blend, folks are going to argue that it's going to be more difficult for you to acculturate because you may want to, but folks might not invite you in, right? This new host culture, you want to knock on the door and come in and they're not letting you in because of perhaps what people are seeing, right? The visible minority status. Skin tone, which I'll show you a little bit of my research on skin tone, also will affect this process. And then when you arrive, the question becomes where are you arriving to? Right? So if you're Dominican and you make your way to Washington Heights, you're going to have a very different experience than if you make your way to Paramus, New Jersey. Right? If you're from Central America, South America, and you make your way to Union City, New Jersey, you're going to have a very different experience than if you make your way to Upper Side Old River, New Jersey. Right? so if you're making your way to places where folks are like you, talk like you, eat the foods that you eat, connect with you, appreciate your values, the acculturation process is going to look very differently. In terms of skin tone, that's something I've always been interested in because the research, and you know, we do this and I really want to encourage folks not to do this. The research talks about Black, Whites and Hispanics. Right? As if Hispanics can't be White or Black. Right? As if we don't come in different colors. And so my research really wanted, my research really wants folks to think about that. You know, when I hang out with my darker skinned Puerto Rican friends we have very different experiences, right? I don't have to wonder whether I can catch a cab at 11 o'clock at night. Cabs will stop and take me wherever I want to go. I don't wonder whether somebody's going to question whether I'm going to change the element of the community if I move into the community. Right? I can kind of blend in because I'm a lighter skinned Puerto Rican. I don't worry about people following me in a store and making sure I'm not going to shoplift. I don't have those experiences. And chances are it's because of my skin tone. And so what I found in my research was, I brought people into the lab and I'll show you the tool we used. Just asked them to kind of identify their skin tone on a scale form one to ten, one being light, ten being dark, and we had the shades in between. And then we administered the race-related stress scale. And what we found was, you know, often times we do research for questions we already have the answers to but we need the data to support it, right? We found that darker skinned people experienced more race-related stress than lighter skinned people. Right? That's not earth shattering. But what was more interesting for me was when I looked at Latinos in particular we found the same experience, that dark skinned Latinos-, the income was negatively correlated with perceived racism. So with Latinos, if you were more poor, you were more likely to experience race-related stress. And then when we did a multiple regression analysis, if you are darker, you're also more likely to experience race-related stress. So it's like a double, double whammy there right? If you're poor and dark skinned, you're going to have a difficult experience. Again, nothing earth shattering. But what for me is exciting about this is that we need to get away from this idea that all Latinos are alike and we all have the same skin tone, right? When we talk about Whites, Blacks and Hispanics and you say Hispanics have this experience in our psychological research, my question to you is going to be which Hispanics? The light skinned Hispanics? The dark skinned Hispanics? We're not capturing that in our research and we have to capture that in our research. And I'll tell you when you look at the results of our current study, what we're finding in terms of skin tone. And it's a very simple variable to measure. And so I want to encourage folks to consider using it in their research. More on acculturation and adaptation. Flores and Carey likened the process to a paralyzing process, the process of acculturation here. Vega describes the struggle as being related to the loss of very important social networks. Folks lack their family support. Income may vary, they may lose some income. Language issues in terms of being able to navigate in their new environment. Their new environment may not be as accepting of their traditional cultural values and their practices. And so Castro, Barrera, and Martinez say that this process can compromise many Latino immigrants' ability to effectively and efficiently adapt to their new surroundings. In terms of our study, we were really interested in understanding the factors that facilitated or inhibited the cultural integration process. How does one become bicultural? What informs that process? We were interested in looking to see if there was evidence in our data to support this Multidimensionality Model that's introduced. And of course, we were interested in the role of skin tone. So that's what we're going to talk about over the next 20, 25 minutes. So I'm going to invite one of my colleagues up, Johanna Oliva, to talk a little about the study and how we went about doing our study. You want to go up there?

JOHANNA OLIVA Yeah, I can come up there. Thank you Doctor Fuentes. So right now we're just going to go into the methods part of our study. And as you can see, most of our participants were actually undergraduate students. 85 of our participants were female, 15 were male and one identified as a transgender. The average of the ages were about 20 years old and because they were all undergraduates, the majority were actually freshmen with 37 percent, sophomore with 35 percent, juniors with 23 and five percent were seniors. As far as race and ethnicity, the majority of the race and ethnicity we received were actually Latinos with 38 percent, Asian with 21 percent, White and Caucasian with 20 percent and then other and Black and African American both received each nine percent. As far as where they were born, on the United States natives, there were 69 of them that were actually born in the United States. 11 were born in Asia. 10 were born in Latin America, five in Europe and three actually were born in Africa. Now the materials that we used, we actually took our participants from the subject pool of the University's Psychology Department. And the pre-screening process was that they had to actually register for our study. They actually saw a screen that said, "Do you practice more than one culture on a regular basis? If yes, then our study is interested if your experience and how you manage with these cultures." So if they actually were bicultural or they experienced more than one culture, then they were able to register for our study. In doing so they then went through an interview process, where after the interview process they filled out a demographic questionnaire and a Skin Color Scale. and then they received one research credit towards their psychology requirement. As part of the interview protocol, we asked them different questions on how they actually felt that they were bicultural. Some of the questions were, "How do you think you became bicultural?" "What helped you become bicultural?? And "Did you encounter any obstacles in becoming bicultural?" After they actually went about and asked them to elaborate on these experiences, we then asked them to fill out the questionnaire where they identified their age, their gender, income, ethnicity, and all those other factors. And then after that they actually filled out the Skin Color Scale, which is actually the unique part of our study is that because we really were looking to see how the skin color or how they identify whether their skin color actually helped their acculturation process. And then for our actual coding analysis, we did an open coding where we identified different themes that we saw within the interviews after the interviews were transcribed. We did an independent review and then after that we actually did some consensus building where we actually identified what were the codes and what were the themes that we mostly saw and we coded them accordingly. After doing that we did a closed coding where each researcher did their own individual closed coding and just tried to really identify what was what we were mostly seeing in the study. And as far as inter-rater agreement, which is what Doctor Fuentes is going to talk a little bit more about later on his presentation. So I'm going to hand it over to Annie (ph) and she's going to talk about the things that we found.

00:20:10
THEMES (FACILITATORS/INHIBITORS) Family (85/21%)-Parents, Siblings, Grandparents, Extended Parents (67/18%) School (53/12%) Friends (36/11%) Language (44%) Discrimination, Greatest Inhibitor (6/32%) 

00:20:10
MULTIDIMENSIONALITY MODEL (FAC) Cultural Practices (language use, media preferences, social affiliations, customs and traditions) Behavioral (79%) Language (44%) Values (belief systems: collectivism vs. individualism) 49% Identifications (attachment to cultural groups and the esteem drawn from them) 58% 

00:20:15
ANNIE So as we were looking through all of the transcripts of the participants interviews, we saw that there were certain themes that came up as facilitators or inhibitors to the cultural integration process. And the themes that came up were family, school, friends, language and discrimination. So when we saw that family came up as a pretty consistent theme, family came up, 85 participants referenced family as being a very important factor to facilitating the cultural integration process. 21 percent referenced it as an inhibitor. And when we talk about family, we're talking broadly about family in including parents, siblings, grandparents and extended family such as aunts or uncles or cousins that may have played a role. When we looked in this family theme, what really stood out and emerged was parents. So 67 of the participants really felt that parents were key in facilitating cultural integration for them. 18 of the participants referenced parents as really inhibiting the process of cultural integration. Another theme that came up was school. And so that 53 of the participants referenced school and their school experiences as helping facilitate that process of cultural integration, where 12 referenced it as inhibiting the process. Friends was another theme that came up with 36 of them, 36 of the participants saying that friends helped facilitate. 11 said that friends were an inhibitor to the cultural integration process. Language was big, very big. Language was referenced by 44 of the participants as being a facilitator of cultural integration. And language did not come up as an inhibitor to the cultural integration process. The other thing that we saw was discrimination, and discrimination came up as the greatest inhibitor. So that 32 of the participants really talked about how discrimination experiences that they had really inhibited their process to becoming culturally integrated. Six of the participants said that experiences of discrimination actually helped facilitate that process for them. So as we reviewed the interviews and the transcripts we were looking at these transcripts and also thinking about this Multidimensionality Model. And we did see that there was the factors of the Multidimensionality Model, such as cultural practices, values and identifications, which Doctor Fuentes spoke about before, really did act as facilitators and were referenced by the participants as helping facilitate that process for them. So when we talk about cultural practices, we're talking about language use, media preferences, whether they listen to Spanish language radio or TV programming, English or any other languages, social affiliations, customs and traditions. So that's really what's included in cultural practices. But what we saw was, because the language was often referenced independently of other kind of cultural and behavioral practices, we looked at language aside from other behavioral practices. So we saw that other behavioral practices, 79 of the participants really referenced behavioral practices such as media preferences, social affiliations, customs and traditions that they celebrated, as being a part of that cultural integration process for them. And then independently language was referenced by 44. We also saw that values, as you know an aspect of this Multidimensionality Model, was also identified as being a factor in their cultural integration process. So 49 participants really talked about how their belief systems, for example their collectivistic versus individualistic belief systems helped in their cultural integration process. And we also looked at identifications and how individual identified. And we saw that 58 of the participants really had some sort of identification attachment to a cultural group and really drew esteem from that, and through that they were able to-, this supported and facilitated their cultural integration process. So we looked at skin color. That's the scale that they used, so basically they had to kind of look at their skin tone and see kind of where they fell and where they matched. So by and large the majority of our participants were lighter skinned. The scale actually has a range of one to ten. But in our results the-, our range was one to eight. So if you look, more than 80 percent really kind of endorsed a lighter skin tone of one, two, three or four. And I believe only about 17 percent broke down in the darker skin tone range. The average for our sample was three, but as we can see, 35 really referenced number two which is a lighter skin tone. Now I'm going to turn it back over to Doctor Fuentes. 

00:26:15
"...I guess sometimes I feel torn, like, I don't call myself Dominican, even though I was born there, I just consider myself American..." 

00:26:15
"...I'd say there was a lot of influence from, I'd say the media and my peers. How I grew up, I mean I couldn't always just stay Hispanic with a Hispanic culture. I went to school, I had to speak English. I became friends with you know, people from other nationalities. From other ethnicities that maybe spoke English, maybe spoke other languages, but English is what we had in common..." 

00:26:15
"...I don't feel connected. Because like in both ways I'm forced to be like this and that. I'm forced to be this person at home. I'm forced to be this person at community, I can't really find my own self. To be comfortable. To be who I am..." 

00:26:15
DISCUSSION Implications Family, especially parents, school and friends play key roles in the cultural integration process. Language was an important facilitator. Discrimination was the greatest inhibitor (light skin sample) Skin tone appeared to be a mediating factor in the integration process, as most of the participants reported lighter skin tones on the New Immigration Survey (NIS) Skin Color Scale (N-101, Avg 30). How do we best prepare people for this dynamic? Evidence to support the Multidimensionality Model. 

00:26:15
DISCUSSION Limitations Focused primarily on the experiences of light-skin, U.S. born undergraduates in a particular region Based on self-identification/self-report Need to establish inter-rater agreement 

00:26:15
DISCUSSION Future Directions Explore the relationship between acculturation and skin tone Examine the differences between U.S.-born and foreign-born individuals Compare Latinos to Non-Latinos Examine relationship between skin tone and inhibitors 

00:26:15
DISCUSSION Questions? Comments? Thanks for joining us! 

00:26:15
MILTON FUENTES So, you know, for me when I do qualitative research the numbers are interesting but the soul of the data are the words, right? That to me is what I need to bring to you. And so I captured three quotes that I think really get at the spirit of our research and what people are experiencing as they try to integrate here in the U.S. "I guess sometimes I feel torn, like, I don't call myself Dominican, even though I was born there, I just consider myself American." "I'd say there was a lot of influences from, I'd say the media and my peers, how I grew up. I mean I couldn't always just stay Hispanic with a Hispanic culture. I went to school, I had to speak English. I became friends with you know, people from other nationalities, from other ethnicities that maybe spoke English, maybe spoke other languages. But English is what we had in common." "I don't feel connected. Because like in both ways I'm forced to be like this and that. I'm forced to be this person at home. I'm forced to be this person at community, I can't really find my own self. To be comfortable. To be who I am." So it really kind of gets at the title of our presentation which is kind of caught between two worlds and what folks are experiencing. So what does all this mean? What's the so what to all this research? So families obviously, especially parents, play a key role. And for those folks who play with parents-, who play with parents-, who work with parents, who work with parents, you know they may come to you and ask, How should I raise my children? Should I raise them to be American, to be more American? Should I help them kind of keep their language and understand their culture of origin? And you know, lots of professionals will say lots of different things to that question. What this research is suggesting is that you want to invite them to do both, right? To experience both. Life is, for me life is much more interesting as a bicultural bilingual individual, much more interesting. I get to experience two different worlds. And so school and friends also play an important role in this process. Language, which isn't surprising, played an important role here as well, right? If you speak both languages, you can enter both worlds comfortably and enjoy both worlds comfortably. So that kind of made sense and folks really kept bringing that point home for us. In terms of the greatest inhibitor, again, it doesn't surprise me, right? If you're experiencing discrimination, the chances of you really wanting to hang out with the new culture, the new host culture are pretty slim. So it kind of doesn't surprise me that that would be a big factor there in terms of the cultural integration process. Now this is what I could use your help with. And it could be our sample, and we'll talk about that as a limitation. But, you know, we said if you experience more than one culture on a regular basis, we're interested in your experience. And what we got was light skinned people coming to our study. Now we could argue that perhaps there are more light skinned students at Montclair State University. We could argue that and so we're already pulling from light skinned folks. But I want you to dialogue with us about what else you think might be going on here. Why is it that light skinned folks are more likely to integrate, culturally integrate or become bicultural than dark skinned folks? We'll talk about that in a second. Oh, I see some hands. That's good. And then the question becomes, how do we best prepare people for this dynamic? Right? If you're working with somebody who is just arriving and has a darker skin tone, how does this come up in the consultation room? How does this come up in the therapy room? Can we bring it up? Can we discuss how to manage this particular dynamic? What will be the experience of this individual and how can we help them navigate that? How can we help them develop resources for navigating this dynamic? And then the other exciting piece is that there is evidence to support this Multidimensionality Model. You know, when the model was introduced, they used a lot of the research to support the model. But it was-, it's a theory. They have a theory about acculturation, so we want to find data to support the theory. And so we have some data here to support this particular model. Some of our limitations, right? We focused primarily on the experience of light skinned folks. So it's their experience culturally integrating. We got to find the dark skinned folks who are culturally integrated and we got to ask them about their experience. And I wonder if they would report more inhibitors than facilitators. We also worked primarily with U.S. born folks. Two-thirds of our population were born here. We do have one-third and so we can dig deeper into the data and see what their experiences were like and do they differ from the U.S. born folks. And we also looked at a particular region, Montclair State University in the Northeast. And so what does that-, how does that compare to the South? How does that compare to the West Coast? So something to think about. We also need to establish our inter-rater agreement. What I found-, we used In Vivo to code our data. And what I did find was, and Annie and Johanna and Stephanie can't be here. She's the project leader. She just started a new job and she can't take time off yet. So she's with us in spirit, but when I looked at what they were doing in terms of the data coding, the instances they found were pretty close. If there was like, 25 of the participants saying school was a facilitator, you know, Annie's said 25. Stephanie said 24, and Johanna said 23. So the numbers weren't too off. So I suspect inter-rater agreement's actually going to be pretty good. But we're still trying to figure out did they identify the same instances at the same time. So it's what we need to look at. In terms of future directions, I'd love to look at the relationship between acculturation and skin tone. Just bring folks into the lab, have them identify their skin tone, do a quick and dirty kind of acculturation measure and see what that relationship is really quickly. I suspect that darker skinned folks are less acculturated or less likely to be acculturated, or less likely to feel invited in. I also would be interested in examining the differences between U.S.-born and foreign-born as I mentioned earlier. Maybe for the NLPA conferences coming up in a couple months in Albuquerque we'll look at Latinos versus non-Latinos at that conference. And we're also interested in looking at the relationship between skin tone and inhibitors. So those folks who have a darker skin tone, we're going to dig deeper into the data to see were they more likely to report inhibitors. My suspicion is that they probably are more likely to report inhibitors. And we'll stop here, take your questions and comments and see where you are at this point. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN My question is how did you define discrimination to the participants? How did you describe that to them or define it to them? 

00:33:25
MILTON FUENTES They actually-, it was a qualitative research study so as we were asking about things that go in the way, in terms of integrating, they reported experiences that sounded to us like discrimination. People commenting on language, their inability to speak clearly, those kinds of things. So we-, yes. Yeah. Right. So it was a qualitative study. So they told us their story and then we looked to see what was in their story. Okay? 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Thank you for the presentation. I have two questions. My first one is about immigration status and if you asked about that and if that was-, if that influenced the person's cultural integration process? And my second one is about the skin tone question. Because I think it was self-, they had to identify their skin tone. I wonder how others viewed them and also as a Hispanic person my skin tone changes depending on environment so that's also interesting for me where I place myself on that. 

00:34:25
MILTON FUENTES Right. Okay. So let me-, in terms of the second question. It was their skin tone at that moment, right? And the inter-rater agreement within that when we do it in the lab, we find that if you say you're a two or a three, chances are we're going to say you're a two or a three as well. So it's actually got pretty decent inter-rater agreement. But, you know, could you tell me more about when you say your skin tone changes depending on the context? You mean just kind of climate-wise? (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Like literally weather, like Miami and Vermont, for example. 

00:35:00
MILTON FUENTES Yes. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN And how that changes drastically. 

00:35:00
MILTON FUENTES Yes, absolutely, absolutely. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN And the other one was the immigration, undocumented versus documented. 

00:35:05
MILTON FUENTES Yes. Did we ask about immigration status? I don't think we did. No. So, we could take a closer look at the data to see what was going on there. I suspect because they were-, and this is just an assumption, majority were students at Montclair State so the majority of the students are citizens. I mean we have a few that were not citizens. But I would suspect the majority are U.S. citizens. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Could you say more about language being a facilitator? I'm not sure exactly what you meant by that. How did it emerge in the interviews? 

00:35:45
MILTON FUENTES Do you want to talk about that? 

00:35:50
ANNIE When I-, when we saw that participants were referencing language and we say that it was a facilitator, language in the sense that they were able to be bilingual. They had-, they were able to retain their language of origin and also have some English fluency. Now that English fluency may have looked different from participant. But they were able to identify mostly as bilingual. So they were able to have both. And that was really key, as a key facilitator. 

00:36:25
JOHANA OLIVA Also we asked them one particular question, what are the advantages of being bicultural? And most of them would say, well language. I speak two languages. So that's how we got all that part of the data. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN On the language topic. When you spoke about parents and families being a great influence on whether people felt integrated or not, did you find out whether the parents spoke English at home or if the parents had a degree of English fluency? 

00:36:55
MILTON FUENTES We don't have that particular data. It didn't come up in the interviews. In terms of parents being facilitators and inhibitors, in some instances parents were insistent that they speak their language at home, that they do things-, here at home you need to do things this way. If you're in school or in the community, you can do whatever needs to happen there, but here at home parents really kind of, in some instances, really forced them to do things with the culture of origin in mind. Did I answer your question? 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:30
MILTON FUENTES Okay. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN I just have one question about the very last slide. You said that you wanted to compare non-Hispanic population-, the Hispanic research to the non-Hispanic. I guess, it's not really a question but kind of a comment. I would wonder if you compared Hispanics to the Black population if you wouldn't find the same disconnect with Blacks, because you're looking at skin tone, who are light skinned all the way to dark skinned. And whether it's one, where is the research done. Where are these students coming from? So you talk a little bit about where they're born. If you're in Vermont versus if you're in New York City. If you're going to assimilate a little bit faster or slower. But if you compared this to other non-Hispanic groups, like the Black population, who have also different skin colors, and whether they feel assimilated to the American culture. 

00:38:25
MILTON FUENTES Yeah. That's an important observation. I think we have the ability to do that. I think we could look at skin tone as a variable. But what do you make of-, I see Maninder's (ph) hand. But I also think, what do you make of the fact that the only folks who came our way were light skinned folks when we asked about bicultural folks. Maninder, did you want to comment on that or did you want a different question? Okay, I'm actually being asked to stay here because of the camera. Okay. I'm not a very good host. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:39:00
MILTON FUENTES Yeah, go ahead. The mike's coming over. Thanks. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN So, I don't know exactly why, but I wonder whether that has something to do with what the research team might have looked like? You, as a researcher being light skinned yourself. And also I think people's experience as light skinned individuals being more accepted, etcetera, that they might be more willing to come forward for a study like this because the level-, not that they don't experience discrimination, but the level and type of discrimination might be very different. And the historical feelings around research studies, you know obviously with Black populations in the United States as well as other populations, has been pretty negative. 

00:39:35
MILTON FUENTES Yeah. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN So I'm wondering whether that might have something to do with it. But thank you, by the way, for an amazing presentation.

00:39:40
MILTON FUENTES Thank you. Thanks, Maninder. Yeah, it's interesting. I do think that that is contributing to this phenomenon. I mean, at the heart of all this is in this country if you have lighter skin, you're going to have a very different experience than if you have darker skin. And so I think more, I mean personally I know that I have had a very different experience as a light skinned Puerto Rican. And doors have been open to me. And I remember growing up as an adolescent, my first name is Milton. And so I was able to like, blend in. I was able to hide. And I remember as a teenager not saying my last name, Fuentes, because that would out me as a Latino. But my skin gave me such privilege to kind of come in and out of circles and nobody would question do I belong here, do I not belong here. So I think that's at the heart of this conversation. Yeah, again, we didn't look for that particular phenomenon, but it's an important phenomenon. I think that the beauty of this work is that it's lifelong work, right? And you are all generating some great, important questions that we could continue asking of folks out there. But it didn't come up. So I could speak anecdotally, right, about that. But it didn't come up in our particular study, the different shades that are in the family. Well folks, I really appreciate your time and attention and your energy. Thank you for being with us and have a great afternoon. Take care.
