Bioenergetics Alexander Lowen, M.D. 

00:01:05
[sil.] 

00:01:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN This is an unusual occasion for me too, because, uh, I'm gonna work with a lady whom I've known for quite a time, and actually who was presented as the, uh, demonstration model ten years ago at this place, at the, uh, conference, you know, that you're having. And, so, it'll be a continuation in a sense, that I've never had her as a patient through the ten years, but we're gonna pick up where she is now and work with the problems that, that she has. So, let me ask, uh, Ann Halek(ph) to come up. 

00:01:50
[sil.] 

00:01:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, do you have a mic, Ann? Do you have one? Could we have a microphone? All right, so that's one. Try that. 

00:02:10
[sil.] 

00:02:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN It's not on yet. 

00:02:45
[sil.] 

00:02:45
ANN HALEK Is it on? Ah. Okay. 

00:03:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN That the mattress? Right through here. 

00:03:05
[sil.] 

00:03:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN Put it ,the long side this way. Okay. I'm just curious. Is there anybody present here who was present at the conference ten years ago? Well, that's interesting. Gonna start as I generally do, if I was doing a regular session with a patient, and ask her a little bit about where she's at, and what she feels. Establish a connection, you know. And we'll go back into the history of, uh, that experience ten years ago, then bring it up to the present. Then we'll move from there. So, uh, can you say a few words about how you're feeling right now, just, uh, nervous? 

00:04:25
ANN HALEK Well, it kind of, uh, brings back a lot of memories. Um, we weren't videotaped last time, so that's new. 

00:04:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN We weren't, huh? 

00:04:35
ANN HALEK No, it was just an audio tape. 

00:04:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN It's much more difficult to do a real session, you know, a large session when you're doing emotional work. 

00:04:45
ANN HALEK Yeah. Um, I, I found the uh, ten years ago the session was very powerful, I think because of the energy in the room, kind of added to, to my energy, and made the work very deep. Um, and the work we did then was very helpful to me, very helpful. 

00:05:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you be specific on which areas in your life? 

00:05:10
ANN HALEK Well, if you remember, um, what we addressed was my asthma. Um, I had had asthma, uh, at that point for about ten years. And it started when I was in a very stressful situation, uh, with four teenagers and a husband that I was not getting along with and working two jobs and all that. And so I had developed this asthma. And, uh, the work we did which . . . 

00:05:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Breathing. 

00:05:40
ANN HALEK . . . brought up, with the breathing and the deep grief work really opened my chest up. Uh, and that's been very helpful. I haven't had, uh, I had one asthma attack shortly after that, but I haven't had any attacks since then. I, you know, I still have chronic asthma, so, and unfortunately I've got a chest cold last week. So, I hope it doesn't interfere with our work, but, I, I have a cough, so. 

00:06:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, I think the work we do will help the cold too. 

00:06:10
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:06:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, uh, do you remember the work we did on sexual issues? 

00:06:15
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:06:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN Would you say a few words about how you experienced that and what it's done? 

00:06:20
ANN HALEK Um, you wanna, which ones? 

00:06:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Anything. Just talk a little bit so we have a sense of what the problems are today, you know. 

00:06:35
ANN HALEK Okay. Okay. Um, it would be easier for me to do if I did it kind of from a history. 

00:06:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes, absolutely. 

00:06:40
ANN HALEK Okay. All right. Um, I would say that for the five years after our work, um, I was, I really had a lot more energy. I was much more in touch with myself. Uh, I was also doing some bioenergetic work. Um, and then about five years ago, uh, a whole cascade of events happened all at once, you know. Life hits you all at once sometimes. And, I need some water. My mouth is drying out. 

00:07:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Should be some, uh, can we get some water that we could have right in front? The throat get's dry, it's awfully difficult to talk. 

00:07:30
ANN HALEK Yeah. Uh, anyway, um, five years ago my father died. And, um, the issue that we had talked about ten years ago had to do with my , um , brother and some early, um sexual play when I was a child. And his, um, my parents came home one time, and he became frightened that I would tell them, and he held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me if I ver told. And so, some of the work we did was on that issue around having my throat cut. The, the fear of that, and the closing down and the, um, inability to speak to talk about what had happened to me, and the fear that I experienced with that. Well, when my father died, um, my brother became in charge of the estate, which was a very upsetting thing for me. And, my mother was still alive, and at the same time in my work, at, at the university we had a change in administration and I love my office where I could do bioenergetic work. And, um there were a lot of changes that were very hard. So, there was this cascade of events that, um, led me to start shutting down. Um, two years later my mother died, and, and it, it, turned out all right. I mean, you know, my, my brother was fair to me, but the fear that I had that remembering his anger and fear and hatred. And, I, it was very hard for me at that point to get past that through that time. Um, two years ago I rented an office and I quit the university part time. And, I rented the office primarily to do my own bioenergetic work. And, um, and that's helped. Um, and then about a year ago, I started a private practice again, and that's helped a lot too. But, but the shutdown that I felt has, um, affected me a lot. Oh, and at the same time, I forgot to mention, five years ago menopause started. Uh, I'm 57 now, so, um,all that, all those things happening together was the, was the real burden. And consequently, I started to shut down. I started not breathing again. Um, and I started gaining weight. And, um, that's been frustrating and upsetting to me. 

00:10:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Uh, well, we can see that the weight is a problem that you have. That's obvious, you know, in terms of the feeling of your body, your ability to move and express your feelings. 

00:10:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Right, I, and I've never been heavy before in my life, so. So. 

00:10:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, I think it was this catastrophic series of events, catastrophic events, that really, you couldn't handle them, see. You feel comfortable doing a little work with me here now? 

00:10:50
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:10:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's good. The way this bioenergetic work, uh, operates is that, uh, we look at a person's breathing to see how well they can get the breath in and out, as an expression of how much energy they have. If you don't breath, your energy is very low. And if you want to change any dynamic in your personality, you need ot have a good store of energy available to work with. To do the breathing, we use a number of exercises. The main one is over a stool like this to get you to use your voice. And hopefully to get you to cry. Have you been able to cry lately? 

00:11:30
ANN HALEK Yes. This past week. 

00:11:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Since you knew you were coming? 

00:11:35
ANN HALEK Yeah. 

00:11:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Is it difficult for you to cry? 

00:11:40
ANN HALEK Yeah. 

00:11:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Do you feel embarrassed by crying? 

00:11:40
ANN HALEK It's mostly the avoidance of the pain. 

00:11:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN But, in the crying, itself, is it painful for you to cry? Where do you feel the pain? 

00:11:55
ANN HALEK Well, I feel it here, and I feel it here. And I feel it here. 

00:12:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, there's a lot of tension in your body. And it's that tension which is really causing you the pain. And unless we can get the tension released, that pain won't clear up. Do you wanna ask me a few questions before we start, and we'll go right to work. 

00:12:15
ANN HALEK Um, no, I don't think so. 

00:12:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Okay. Now, this is a body work, see, so that you have to take off the clothes a bit. Not naked, you know, but we want to see the body itself and how it operates, especially the movement of the breathing, where the holding patterns are in the body. Because if we don't work on that level, we can't make change in the personality that the body work needs to go to. Come on up, Ann. Let's go right to work. 

00:12:45
ANN HALEK Okay. Did you want me to say anything about my history? You know? 

00:12:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN I'm not sure. What we need to go for a moment, and we'll see where it goes. Annie. 

00:12:55
ANN HALEK I'll take this off. 

00:13:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, Ann told you that she suffered from asthma. And I worked with a lot of asthma patients because we do a lot of work on breathing. And one of the things I found out is that asthma is caused in a child when it blocks its crying. Your, and they you try to choke it off because your parents can't stand the crying. You choke off your breathing and you go in a spasm. And from then on, you're vulnerable to an asthmatic attack any time the pressure increases and you can't cry. So, we've got to get our patients to cry. If you cry, and if you saw the demonstration I did the first day, you remember I had everybody crying a bit, as much as I could. Crying is the healthy way to release tension. Babies cry because they get tight and frustrated. And when they start to cry, the crying itself released the tension, as nothing else can. We use, uh, 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN We start with this exercise. This is called a breathing stool, and you're lying over it, and begin to make a sound in a voice. And we can see, you're forced to breathe when you make a sound because you can't make a sound if you don't breathe. And we watch the breathing process and try to deepen it and open it up. So come on, Ann. Come on over that. I'm gonna tell you this, that I do this exercise almost every day of my life. I do it because it helps me breathe. The more I breathe, the longer I'll live. Bring your feet back a little more. All right. Now she has a lot of tension in her body. That's the thing that's creating the fat tendency in the body. When you are tense, and you are holding back the expression of feeling, the energy is not being released and it accumulates in the body as fat tissue. Now, try to make a sound, Ann. Good. Just let it come out stronger. 

00:15:10
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:15:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now breathe. Now that's a constricted sound, you see. We want to open that voice so the air can also go through. Take a breath in and make it louder now. 

00:15:30
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:15:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Keep it going. 

00:15:40
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:15:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now breathe. There. Now we go the breathing started. You can see it in the body. That's very good. You're not too frightened, are you? Now when you do it again, making that sound. At the end of the sound, go into the uh-uh-uh-uh. Break through to the crying if you can. You're right on the edge, you know. 

00:16:15
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:16:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's good. That's it. Now the body's coming alive. You see that movement through the body as the wave of her breathing goes through. Go on. There. Okay. Now relax a bit. And you can see where the breathing held all through here. That's good. Can you do it on more time? 

00:16:55
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:17:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's good. Stay with me. And you can hear the choking off of her cry. And see, right now, and that's where the asthma comes from. Breathe. Just breath. That's it. Now, when you breathe and come alive, you're also gonna feel the pain in your body by, caused by the tension. Do you wanna come up for a moment here? And now bend forward. We'll reverse the position, bring your feet closer together. Closer together. Even a little more. Now put your fingertips down, Ann. See? And now straighten the knees, and what we're looking for here is what's happening. The legs start to vibrate and vibration is the release of tension. You shake loose. And this is nature's way of healing the body. Keep breathing and keep vibrating. Okay. I can hear her breathe now. Now one, one experience in the treatment like this isn't gonna change her. But I wanna get her back into a pattern where she's gonna do this exercise pretty regularly at home with a stool. Cry. Vibrate. Cry Vibrate. And it'll deepen her breathing, and only that will help her get over the problem of the weight and the problem of the, uh, tension and throat. That's good. Now, come on. Keep breathing. Now, make the sound again, Ann. Come on. 

00:18:50
ANN HALEK Ah. 

00:18:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's great, and let it go through your body. Come on. And let the crying come out. Come on. You've got a lot to cry about. That's it. Go on. 

00:19:20
[sil.] 

00:19:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now you cannot go wrong breathing, but you go wrong if you don't breathe. Press more into your feet if you can, Ann. Just lean a little forward. Now straighten the knees more to get. Yeah, there you go. See? Good. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:19:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Wanna come up? Stay like that. Let your mouth open. Okay. Now, when you study Ann's body, you can see she's got a big hump here. You know now. And that's hang up. She's hung up like this, unable to come down into her feet. You know? Very frustrated, aren't you in this situation. That's good. That's it. Now, this all has to be stretched out, but you can't stretch it out because it's holding you up, and you're afraid to let down. Now there's a lot in Ann's personality of trying to hold herself up all the time. You sense that? And the holding up is that I'm gonna try to be a good girl and child. I'm gonna try to be successful. I'm gonna try to do the right thing. Holding yourself up and afraid to break down. That this is the result then your, you get. That's good. Just let the crying go a little more. And keep the vibrations going. That's all. Now let's, we make it stronger all the time to get more vibration. To get more release, vibrations release. And I'll ask Ann to come over here to the mattress and we'll just put your head up here, Ann. This isn't a good mattress to work with, but they, they were made to sleep on, not to do bioenergetics. And what we need to do then. We go the crying going. We need her now to express some stronger feelings such as anger, you know, because she's been hurt. She's suffered. And if you can't get a little angry about the fate you've had to suffer, then you get stuck, and you can't get the release. So, start to kick a bit, Ann. Raise your legs higher. Higher. Now, as loud as you can, use the word "Why". Go on. As strong as you can. 

00:22:30
ANN HALEK Why. Why. Why. 

00:22:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Get up to a scream if you can. 

00:22:40
ANN HALEK Why. 

00:22:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. Go on. Go on. Way up. 

00:22:45
ANN HALEK Why. Why. Why. 

00:22:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's good. That's it. Breathe. Breathe. All right, now bend the knees up a bit. Let the crying work. She has put on a lot of weight since the, uh, last time I've seen her actually. Do you have any idea how much? 50 pounds. Yeah. That's good. That's good. And, uh, that's the holding in of her feelings that puts the weight on, because if you let the feelings come out, you see, you discharge attention, and your body relaxes and it stays trim. Are you tired? 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:23:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you make the kicking a little stronger. And what would you like to say? You know, you can say no, why, leave me alone. Don't touch me. Anything that expresses some feeling you have. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Why's a good one, a good one for everybody. 

00:24:25
ANN HALEK Why. Why. 

00:24:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Get it up to a scream if you can, Ann. 

00:24:30
ANN HALEK Why. 

00:24:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Excellent. 

00:24:40
ANN HALEK Why. 

00:24:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Good. That's it. Go on. You wanna rest a moment? That's it. Just let the crying work. That's it. Now the body's beginning to move now, and it's moving because she's releasing some of the tension that held her in. Good. That's good. Very good. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, do you have a sense of what you would like to do or say now? Feel your body and see what it wants to do. Would it like to kick so more or what? 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:40
ANN HALEK You know. I feel, I feel trapped. 

00:26:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes, you are. Okay. Hold on to that. 

00:26:15
ANN HALEK I feel , I feel trapped. I feel, you know what I mean. I can feel the weight, and I feel, I feel bound by it. And, my, my dilemma's been is that when I want it off, I, I and there's some, I stop it from happening, cuz I know what to do. I just. 

00:26:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Were you say easy or?(ph) 

00:26:50
ANN HALEK Uh-huh. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:26:55
ANN HALEK It's the, the, uh, weight is insulating me. And so in a way, I, I like it. And, and, at the same time I hate it. So it's like, it's like I'm in this, I'm in this fight with myself again. 

00:27:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN You are. That's right. It goes on my head. 

00:27:30
ANN HALEK It goes the other way. 

00:27:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN But, she knows how to do it. I'll let her. Come up further. I'll take this. 

00:27:35
ANN HALEK I have to wear the funny one. Let's see. We'll do it like that. Other way. All right. Exactly the way it doesn't look like it should go. 

00:27:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN There it is. We can hear it now. 

00:27:55
ANN HALEK All right. 

00:27:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you hear her? 

00:27:55
ANN HALEK You can hear it? 

00:27:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now have a seat over, uh, on that. 

00:28:00
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN Because we have to do a certain amount of analysis, understanding the problem. You can't do these things blindly. Just breathe in, and we'll talk a little more. Then we'll go back to some work. 

00:28:10
ANN HALEK Okay. 

00:28:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN Breathe in. Relax. Do you feel frightened? 

00:28:20
ANN HALEK Somewhat. 

00:28:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN Mostly sad? 

00:28:25
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:28:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN Try to say exactly what you're feeling. It'll help. 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:35
ANN HALEK Well, I, as I was telling you a minute ago. I feel caught, it, within myself. It's like, um, and you know what to do, and yet I can't push myself through it, you know? Um, and the, the, um, the, the struggle that I feel it's, um, it's, it's an internal thing, you know. 

00:29:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN I believe that, but, uh, can you sense what the internal struggle is about? Now, you don't mind here, in, in this work as we, that we get in deeply into this? 

00:29:30
ANN HALEK Right. Right. 

00:29:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN But you see, you, insulating yourself and one has to ask what are you afraid of in terms of coming out from behind this protective, uh, insulation? Well, you know something about your history and your problems. It's a little embarrassing to be up here, but, uh, I think she is no different than any of the people here. We're all struggling to find some meaning in life, and some happiness and joy. And if we hold things in, we'll never get there. 

00:30:10
[sil.] 

00:30:10
ANN HALEK I'm afraid of the sadness, and I think that keeps me from, from feeling, cuz I don't wanna feel the sadness. And I think I don't also, I don't wanna let myself down. And I, and I feel like I am letting myself down. 

00:30:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes, you are, but, uh, that's healthy. Whereas holding yourself up, you do this. Posture, you see, and you defeat yourself. When you let yourself down, you come down into your feet and you feel solid. You've got the ground under you, but if you're hung up like this, you're a disaster and will continue. 

00:30:55
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So, how do I get my shoulders to 

00:30:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Huh? 

00:31:00
ANN HALEK How do I get this part to let go? 

00:31:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, first place, you gott a do much more screaming and crying to get some energy into your body. And then, uh, this area here, you have your back up. Follow? 

00:31:15
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:31:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN Do you know what having your back up means as an emotional expression? 

00:31:15
ANN HALEK Anger. 

00:31:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Anger. She's holding a lot of anger in, and has held it in all her life. That's why you get this problem. Can you feel your anger any way? 

00:31:25
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:31:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Is it hard for you to express it? It is, of course. 

00:31:35
ANN HALEK It is, yeah. 

00:31:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, uh, you want me to go on mammalizing(ph) the words? 

00:31:40
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:31:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN So, we look at Ann, and you look at her face, see? And what you see is that she's always trying to be pleasant and nice and agreeable, etc. And hold in the negative feelings. So they all accumulate up in here. Am I right? 

00:32:00
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN All right. Now sit. Let me come over a little closer here. Uh, can you get a nice position on there safely? 

00:32:10
ANN HALEK What do you mean? 

00:32:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Just like that, so you could, yeah. Now you're gonna look at the audience. Make two fists. That's good. You are, yeah. That changes your expression. What are you feeling when you do that? 

00:32:25
ANN HALEK The anger. 

00:32:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you express it now? 

00:32:25
ANN HALEK Yes. 

00:32:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Go on. 

00:32:30
ANN HALEK Ow. 

00:32:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN With words. What are you feeling? What could you do? 

00:32:30
ANN HALEK I could kill. 

00:32:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Go on. Let it out. 

00:32:40
ANN HALEK I could kill. 

00:32:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you scream it? 

00:32:40
ANN HALEK I could kill. 

00:32:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Break down if you wanna. 

00:32:45
ANN HALEK Oh. 

00:32:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. Louder. Now again. 

00:32:55
ANN HALEK Oh. Oh. 

00:33:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN The choking. Listen. Get the scream out. I could kill. 

00:33:00
ANN HALEK I could kill. 

00:33:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN Go on. 

00:33:05
ANN HALEK I kill. 

00:33:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. Go on. 

00:33:10
ANN HALEK I could kill. 

00:33:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Okay. Let it go. Let it go. Well, if I was in your position, I would feel I could kill someone. You got badly hurt as a child. You know that. Now, that's good. Breathe. Ann, listen. As you get these feelings out, you're gonna lose weight. That's the only chance you have to lose weight. To get the feelings out. Holding in will just blow you up like a balloon. 

00:33:50
[sil.] 

00:33:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, uh, can you think of a, we'll go with the anger a bit, because there's such anger there. The other thing we do as an exercise is to the hit the couch, you know. And, uh, generally we use the tennis racket for that. We don't have it, but, uh, you can express it just like that, see. Right? 

00:34:25
ANN HALEK Mm-hmm. 

00:34:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN Do it again. 

00:34:25
ANN HALEK I could kill. I could kill them. I could kill them. I hate them. 

00:34:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Good. Let it out. 

00:34:35
ANN HALEK I hate them. Oh. I hate them. 

00:34:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Okay. Breathe out. Now look, you're on the edge of it. You have to get it, you've got to get it up into a higher place. Follow? And that's the release, because it's caught here. I could kill. You know. Get it way up there. Do you know why you're afraid to get into higher pitch, which is effective? 

00:35:05
ANN HALEK Why? 

00:35:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN You're afraid to lose control. 

00:35:10
ANN HALEK Yeah. I'm afraid I will. 

00:35:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN But, you're safe here, Ann. You are. First place, because you've got somebody who knows you and can control it and guide you. But, you, a person doesn't feel that it's safe, you know? To lose their head, they'd go crazy. They would kill, you know. So, let's go a little closer to it, okay? Look. Like this. Shake your head when you're saying, "I could kill you." Shake your head. 

00:35:40
ANN HALEK I could kill you. 

00:35:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. 

00:35:40
ANN HALEK I could kill you. I could kill you. 

00:35:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Excellent. Go on. 

00:35:50
ANN HALEK I could kill you. I could kill you. 

00:35:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN Good. 

00:35:50
ANN HALEK I could kill you. I could kill you. 

00:35:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Okay. Push. Relax. Drop the arms. That's enough. I hear a little deeper breathing. Does it embarrass you to go into these feelings? 

00:36:10
ANN HALEK No. 

00:36:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, good. That's good. That's good. That's good, Ann. 

00:36:15
ANN HALEK I feel liberated. 

00:36:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Huh? 

00:36:20
ANN HALEK I feel liberated. 

00:36:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, remember she said that she was boxed in. what she was holding in was all this tremendous rage, right. 

00:36:30
ANN HALEK Yes. I could kill you. 

00:36:40
[sil.] 

00:36:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN You have a lot more of that in you, haven't you? 

00:36:55
ANN HALEK Yes. 

00:36:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, now what I would suggest if, does it frighten you to go into this, uh, degree of anger? 

00:37:00
ANN HALEK Actually, it felt good. It felt , it's like something shook loose. 

00:37:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's exactly it. It helps, yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:10
ANN HALEK Yeah. Yeah. I mean I've been, I've been hitting with the racket a lot, but it hasn't. 

00:37:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Liberated you. 

00:37:20
ANN HALEK It hasn't let that go. 

00:37:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, see there. We're dealing with a deeper problem. Not just a recent one. A whole characterological(ph) problem of being a good girl. I know you. And staying in control. You really let yourself go out of control. So, you hold this tension here in this statement I mustn't lose my head. Don't lose your head. Don't lose your head, Ann. And look at what you end up with then. That's where this is. Now, can I would recommend you do this, uh, I, I could kill you at home. Well, if you can. No, it's all right. We use a lot of other expressions. We don't have to go to this area, you know, to the actual violence or actual I could kill you. See? Come round your back again. Let them get the anger, get the breathing going. And let's do some other expressions that are as liberating. Go with the words, "Leave me alone." 

00:38:35
ANN HALEK Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. 

00:38:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Scream it if you can. 

00:38:45
ANN HALEK Leave me alone. 

00:38:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN Get it up there. 

00:38:50
ANN HALEK Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Leave me. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. 

00:39:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's right. 

00:39:05
ANN HALEK Leave me alone. I'm so alone. 

00:39:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's good. 

00:39:10
ANN HALEK Leave me alone. Ah. 

00:39:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. That's good. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN That's it. Good. 

00:39:35
[sil.] 

00:39:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, you can work these problems out. She's still in her fifties. You know, in one session or ten or even a hundred. You've got to stay with this problem and work on it all the time. It's deeply structured in there. That's good. Breathe. But you feel better for it. Freer. That's it. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, we're gonna go into a deeper aspect of the problem. And you can tell as, as I can tell when you saw her standing, that she's really a very nice person. See? In a way, a good person. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN And I think all her life she made a tremendous effort to be nice. You can see that in her expression. Hang on, right in that statement, Ann. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN What are you thinking? I know what I'm thinking. 

00:41:20
ANN HALEK I'm wondering what you're gonna do. 

00:41:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN Well, why don't you ask me? Well, I'm not really gonna do anything. I'll just try to guide her into where the issues are that we can face. You wanna sit up a minute again? Come back? Huh? Yes? Yeah. Fell comfortable there. That's better. Now, Ann can get a, some of her anger out. Not enough, you see, but there's a deeper problem in her personality and in her body, you see, that blocks her and ties her up. Do you know what it is? Huh? Well, certain, there's a split somewhere through here. You feel it, right? It's from right across here. Well, what does it split? Sexuality. It splits the lower part of your body from the upper part of your body, and that reflects a sexual problem. And until that sexual problem is worked on and a release of the contraction, you know, occurs, she can't get loose of the fact. She can't let it pass out. See? And this is to everybody in this culture has a sexual problem. It might shock you when I say that, of course, this is not a natural society where people are free to live the life of the body. Oh yes, they have sex and all of that. But, they never really surrender to it. They do it, but they don't feel it. They don't feel a sense of release. There isn't a sense of giving in to your feelings. Sex is only one of them. Anger is another. Crying's a third. You block feeling, and then you blow up like this. That's the reality. All right. Now, when she was here ten years ago, we worked on the sexual issue, see. But, obviously it was a, more a demonstration. Did I ever work with you as a patient really? How many sessions did we have? Really? Well. Didn't do enough then. See you, you judge the effectiveness of the therapy by the changes that occur in the person. Now at that time I wasn't strong enough myself as a therapist to break through to the issues. I can do it more easily now, but even then, it's not one or two sessions. It's a lifetime commitment to your body and to releasing tension. All right. 

00:44:15
ANN HALEK I'm not ready to stop. (inaudible) 

00:44:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes. The sexuality, yeah. Now, do you like, some more work, right? Could you? No, is it? Let's do the inter sexual exercise a bit anyway. Grab ahold of the ankles. This is a basic sexual exercise in bioenergetics, which opens t his area up. Put, put your head way back. Grab your ankles. Hold on to your ankles. It's called a pelvic arch. Hold on. Put your head way back. Come on. Come on. Put yourself forward. Push yourself more forward. Get your head back more. Get it out of the picture when you're having sex, don't think. You don't need your head. Now bring your knees together a bit. Force them together and breathe. Now we're gonna open this whole tension up. Not greatly, but at least a little. That's it. Good. That's it. Now at least we get the breathing down here, so we're past this block a little bit. Not enough. Bring your knees together more. Come on. Breathe stronger. Come on. Breathe. Good. Come on. That's good. There. You're getting there. Keep breathing. It's going through now. Yes. That's the release. It's not strong enough, but it's going through. That's it. It's going through the whole body. Good. 

00:46:00
[sil.] 

00:46:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN Bring those knees together more. Good. All right. Now, that's the sexual movement, where the pelvis is moving that way. It's not coordinated yet, but it's a breakthrough. Keep it going. Go ahead. Wanna rest? Try to stay with it. The longer you stay with it, the more it releases. Put your head back even more. Come on. When you're having sex, get the head out of the way. Get your head back more. Come on. Come on. That's it. There we go. Now, we, will you be able to do this yourself at home? 

00:46:40
ANN HALEK Yeah. 

00:46:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Okay. It'll make the difference. Yes, that's good. Are you frightened by these vibrations? Huh? What, what did you say? 

00:46:55
ANN HALEK I just avoided it. 

00:46:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes. That's it. Great. 

00:47:10
[sil.] 

00:47:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Very good. How does it feel to you? 

00:47:20
ANN HALEK Good. 

00:47:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN Remember you said you were blocked up. Does it feel as if it's sort of opening for you? Good for you. You'll warm up through there. Grab the ankles once more. Let's try to get it. Now, some of you have, may have the exercise book that we use, called "The Weight of Vibrant Health". It has a picture of this exercise and how to do it. And, grab your ankles more. Can you? Good. Grab them. Pull on them and put your head way back. See? Come on. That's it. That's better. That's it. Breathe. That's it. Breathe. That's it. 

00:48:05
ANN HALEK (inaudible) 

00:48:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yes, that's all right. You just gotta feel your way. That's good. That's it. Go ahead. Shake loose. Good. Put your head back more. That's it. That's it. And make a sound now. Come on. Louder. Louder, come on. Come on. Get the voice out. That's it. Let me say that you won't reach an orgasm doing this, but you'll get a release. 

00:48:55
[sil.] 

00:48:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN You wanna come up or stay? Rest? 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:10
ANN HALEK Thank you. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN Did that embarrass you? 

00:49:50
ANN HALEK It's a strange thing. 

00:49:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN It's a strange thing to be, uh, cheered for letting go. Generally you're praised for holding in. Can you say some words about how you feel? Slowly. 

00:50:20
ANN HALEK It's such a strange thing to have, have the society praise us for the things that cripple us. You know, it's, it's a very strange thing. So, thank you. I think you're applauding the right thing. And. 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:40
ANN HALEK I, I'll keep the memory of that to help me get through. Thank you. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:50:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Would you like to ask me any questions, Ann? 

00:51:20
[sil.] 

00:51:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN You'll have to stay with this. Yeah, I was telling her that she has to stay with these exercises consistently, regularly because the tensions were tremendous. And you've got to just slowly start working them out. Just what you did her. Can you, uh, kick at home like that? Like you did kick? 

00:51:55
ANN HALEK Yes. 

00:51:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, let me say that I go, I do these exercises myself. I kick every morning or generally every morning about 350 times. Get into my feet, so I'm gonna ask her to get into her feet, when you're ready. Cuz you have a different sense of yourself when you can feel your feet on the ground as they say. All right. I'm getting my feeling of feet. My feet are on the ground. And you can see the difference as I stand here. 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Can you stand on your feet? Put this away. That's right. Bring your feet parallel. Closer together a bit. Closer. Closer. Closer still more. Turn your toes in a little. That's good, yeah. Bring them closer. Oh,yeah. like that. Now, can you feel your feet touching the ground? Press into the heel. Hold your head up a bit. That's it. Now breathe. Breathe. Feel your heel. Press into it strong, Ann. This is called in bio, in bioenergetics, this is called grounding, feeling your connection to the ground. That's it. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:53:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Now, when she does it, did you feel it about up to here? Just down a bit? There. It's really gotta go all the way up your back. Try arching your head back a little. All right. Now, try it. 

00:54:05
ANN HALEK There we go. 

00:54:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN Ghere we go. Go ahead. Now, breathe. Breathe. Stronger. Stronger. The stronger you breathe, the more energy you have. Go ahead. Breathe. Come on. That's it. Breathe. And press the feet against the floor. That's it. Come on. That's it. There it goes. Go ahead. Keep going. Like that. 

00:54:30
ANN HALEK Yeah. 

00:54:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN Yeah. That's it. Hold it. That's it. 

00:54:45
[sil.] 

00:54:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN Still feel your feet? When I did the workshop, I had a number of people doing this exercise. One I love to do myself. And I'll just tell you how these things come about. Some years ago I was walking down a country road near my summer home, and as I took a step, I suddenly felt myself grow two inches taller. I never knew why, how it happened. Took me many years to find out where the ball of the foot really is. And most people do not know where it is. It's, so I'll tell you that the ball of the foot is just in front of the heel. And when you can press that part of your body into the ground, like I'm doing now, I can feel a chill go up my back or a tingle. You know what they call that charge going up the back? Kundalini. That's how you can reach your kundalini charge. Hold it now. Good. That's it. See the hump is diminishing a little right here. 

00:56:30
[sil.] 

00:56:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN We're stomping. Now, uh, can you say a few words about how you feel? Then we'll quit. 

00:56:50
ANN HALEK I feel so much better. I feel. I feel like myself again. I feel , I feel, I can feel the energy, and I've been trying to get that energy to move through, but I stopped it every time. And I knew, but I couldn't, couldn't get it to it. Thank you. 

00:57:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN Thank you for coming up.
