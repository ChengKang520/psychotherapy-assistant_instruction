C. ALEXANDER SIMPKINS Ah - 

00:00:00
MARY PIPHER Nice, quiet. 

00:00:00
C. ALEXANDER SIMPKINS - hello everyone. May I have quiet please. Thank you. Ah, hello my name is C. Alexander Simpkins and I'm moderating for this topical panel with, ah, Don Meichenbaum, Mary Pipher and John Gottman on children and adolescents, thank you for your attention. 

00:00:30
DON MEICHENBAUM Well, good morning and welcome. Thank you for your attendance and interest then moreover let me commend you on your good judgment in being here. Ah, this a critically important topic because almost all forms of adult psychopathology whether it's aggressive behavior or other forms of externalizing problems or whether its internalizing problems like, ah, depression suicidality, more or like personality disorders and the like begin in, ah, childhood and adolescents. There are very few forms of adult psychopathology that have that kind of onset. And not only that with regard to certain kinds of behaviors that I involve in, in terms of externalizing problems like aggression and so forth. Ah, your aggressive behavior is as consistent over the course of your life is as your I.Q. So if we can identify the early starting risk factors than maybe we could do something to intervene accordingly. I am-- I'm 73 years of age and I am in what Erik Erikson calls the generativity phase of life. I am, ah, head of the Melissa Institute Research, ah, director of the Melissa Institute. And we have, ah, developed the website called www.melissainstitute.org, uhm, that this year alone has had 2 million hits worldwide. Ah, all of the stuff that I'm going to, ah, talk about you can go to the Melissa Institute website and download. Given my obsessive nature, ah, I have also put together a, ah, 357 page handout that's on the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference. And for this presentation you can go to pages 108 to 258 and see, uhm, what makes a violent youth? How do you get from being born to killing Melissa? Ah, and how do you intervene? There is also a large section near on adolescent suicide, ah, treatment of anxiety disorders and trauma. So, I, I have a real concern that, ah, children in this world are overlooked and, ah, do not get ample attention. Moreover I have a question for my co-presenters and for you in the audience. This week is the anniversary of the Newtown shooting and you'll see the annual report we actually put that picture on place. This week Vice-President Biden, met with the surviving families of the Newtown 28 children and teachers who were killed. He said that the administration is now going to spend several $100 million on mental health for children and adolescents. 

00:03:55

00:04:00
DON MEICHENBAUM So, here's the question. Given what we know, how do you think we should spend that money? What do you think we know about the development of psychopathology and the likelihood of violence towards others or towards oneself that you think we should intervene, a mess kind of interesting. You know, where are we as a field in understanding this as to where you would spend your money. What are the potential protective factors that help kids who are in high risk make it in spite of? If you identify children who are high aggressive by using some universal screening. This is a double-edged sword because if you follow them developmentally one-half to two-thirds are going to desist and no longer be aggressive. And if you identify these kids too early you have the potential of making things worth and stigmatizing them. The Melissa Institute they just give you one example, has, uhm, a preventive of intervention especially with regard to aggression I'll talk about the others of-- in terms of de-- depression and, and anxiety in a moment. If you can get children to read by grade three at grade level, the likelihood of them getting in trouble with the law is significantly reduced. In fact, people who are in the business of building prison cells in the United States. Look at the failure rate at grade three and make pretty good predictions of the likelihood of the number of cells they're going to need when these kids grow up. This is as good as Gottman predicting divorce. No, this is really important, right? Cuz, you don't wanna buy expensive gifts for people who seven years down the road are going to get divorce? Right? And this is not something you wanna do, okay? So, one of the things that becomes really kind of interesting is we at the Melissians do have put a lot of work into reading and you can go to the website and actually download 300 movies for free on how to teach reading comprehension skills. And it's not just that reading occurs, ah, reading becomes a gateway skill that has all kinds of trajectory implications cuz if they have difficulty reading the net, difficulty with behavior they get sent to the principal's office, if you get sent that principal's office 10 times not only that you then get to put into especial classroom, if you get put in the special classroom as well other kids you get suspended. So what happens if they put on a trajectory? So, I think that if you're going to study child psychopathology you need to have a lifespan perspective. And we have written about and be happen to address questions here, on how you could alter that cascading model. Ah, we spend a lot on s-- on bullying and cyber bullying and interpersonal violence and, and you'll be able to go into the handout and see all the work that we've done with regard to adolescent suicide and depression. In fact, we have argued on-- that you need a kind of checklist for what needs to go on in training gate keepers, emergency staff, school personnel and community because as the adage goes, it takes a village to help people make it. We now know and I'll pass the mike over to my colleagues in a moment, what are the nature or protective factors that kids need? Kids need guardian angels. They need some significant other in their lives. Some kind of support system. So, in fact, one of the things that we ask children regularly is the following. If you were absent from school, who beside your friends would notice that you're missing and would miss you? That's a very clever question. And what happens is it turns out that school connecting this is absolutely a critical issue. And I could talk you know, on other ways to get that besides that question. If you're dealing with African-American youth and this questions should be rationally and ethically sensitive. One of the most important questions I'll talk more about this tomorrow with regard to spirituality is when is the last time you went to church and who talk to you? So, one of the things that becomes interesting is that you need to know that social network. The last thing that I'll comment on is each kid has a particular skills, some redeeming feature. And it needs to be a very strength-based orientation from my prospective. It's not a matter of just treating the psychopathology of getting rid of the symptoms but you need to find out whether they have a particular athletic skill, competence, ah, that they have some kind of, ah, sense of humor. Look, look I-- I come from Canada, and the treatment of choice in Canada, okay, ah, Canadians have no innovations, okay. These people who yell out should be on meds, okay. Ah, so I come from Canada, right? So, what is the treatment of choice for cognitive disorder to hyperactive kids in Canada? Hockey, right. And I suspect that the people who yelled out most likely played hockey as kids. 

00:09:55
MARY PIPHER I've got-- I've got a mike. Well, thanks that was really interesting. Uhm. 

00:10:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Can I se-- can I say something Mary? 

00:10:05
MARY PIPHER Sure. 

00:10:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Ah, I've known Don Meichenbaum for 40 years and, ah, I don't know but this generative phase in my opinion, he has never left adolescence. 

00:10:20
MARY PIPHER Well, I was gonna comment on that phase too because I don't wanna say I'm in stagnation after you said you were in generative phase. Ah, but I'm in a different-- I'm in a different place than Don because his working at a very big level with, with national problems and national institutes. And I live in Nebraska and I'm working at a very small level with the children around me and, and through writing and through big engaged with grandchildren and refugees children and poor children in my town and so on. And, ah, I'll just say a few things and then we're gonna leave a lot of time for people ask questions because we mainly wanna talk about what you wanna hear. But since I wrote Reviving Ophelia now came out about 20 years ago that long. And-- thank you, thank you. But since I wrote that book, uhm, when I wrote that book most homes did not have PCs. And, uhm, also the video game industry didn't exist at any level like it does now. Also 9/11 hadn't occurred. And we had not had a school shooting in this country. And this reminds me of a point I wanna make about children which is I think children are traumatized now, all children are traumatized as they come to understand the world they're living in. And, uhm, there's very interesting study done by Alex Bentley. And what he did he had some kind of giant computer where he could measure, he, he could count by year the number of emotional words in the English language published in America over the last century. So we started out in like 1910, and, and put all this you know, newspapers, literature, etcetera into this giant computer program and, and he, he found out a whole lot about changes in the emotional life of, of Americans. Now, interestingly enough with all of the psychology we've had in the last half of the, the 20th century. The most, ah, emotional times with the 20s when they started. A h, we-- we have actually lost emotional words in our language. And the 20s were also not surprisingly the time when there were the most happy words. People were happy in the 20s. There are full of hope, times work good, the war was over, you know, it was just a very lots of progress, lots of important changes in quality, a life and people were really having a good time. The time when people were sadist, just take a guess, World War II lot of sorrow words. Now, what's happened since 1970 on is more and more fear words. Every year our language is pervaded by more fear words. And I think this fear is in the bodies of all of us, I think it's in the bodies of children. And so, one of the things that I think a lot about when I think about helping children, uhm, is-- I know as an adult with many years practice in yoga and Buddhism and so on. How hard it is to quite to myself. And so I think how is it, ah, I can help children learn to, to be quite and calm and find a space within themselves that, that they can trust to take care of them. And this is-- this is poor children it's refugee children, it's children whose parents worked two jobs, who are mostly alone and so on. And the, the main things I've come up with for this is first of all I, I really like to help children with mindfulness and breathing, and yoga and things like that, and just simple the little things like when I visit refugees I take them a gift called sturdy birdy, do you know-- any of you know what that is? It's a little yoga game for kids where they spin the dice and then hold yoga poses. But it's a very-- it's exercise if you live in a small apartment it's yoga, it's meditation and breathing and so on. I also have a great deal of faith in the idea that no matter how small the home is, there needs to be some place in it that's quiet and that anyone in the family can go and be alone and calm down and work with their own upsetness or discomfort or need for calmness. And then the other thing I wanted to mention is one of the most grounding experiences, any of us can have, is to have a deep connection with the natural world. And I live in Nebraska that's not very hard to pull off. But wherever you live there's a sky and there are birds. And so one of the things I, I really-- every child I visit and work with that is over 2 years old, I take a bird book too. And whenever I have children with me and I'm outside which is I always try to be outside with children if I can. I teach them the very simple and beautiful skill of lying down and looking at the sky. In the daytime or at night, my little grandson Coltrane woke me up he stayed on that with us and he woke me up around four in the morning and of course I didn't wanna wake up, but I thought, well given I'm up what can we do for two or three hours until the sun comes up. And I realized you know, were going out lying under the stars. So we get our sleeping bags and bundle up we go out and lie in our front yard under the stars. And I talk to him about whatever the constellations in the sky. And he said, uhm, "Nana we're looking at the universe together." Well, I think that lesson for him is the lesson I would when all children to have. I did that Newton-- ah, Newtown Connecticut is a very example of when that can help an adult. That night after Newtown it was really, really cold in Nebraska. And, and I went out with the sleeping bag and a big blanket and I was so rattled by that event. I just could not get my arousal system to calm down. And I lay down on the driveway and I looked at the stars and it took me about an hour and a half. But, but it worked for me to calm me down. So one of the things I, I very much like is to help children from a very young age. I think to raise children is extraordinarily difficult work in 2013. And I think the primary components are wisdom, work, attention and presence. And, uhm, ah, I really-- I think most of my goals with my own grandchildren with any grandchildren I-- or with any children I work with. Uhm, all of them seem like my grandchildren by now, children all seem like grandchildren with me. It is to give them this set of inner skills that will enable them to deal with whatever happens next, so. Thank you. Thank you. 

00:18:30
JOHN GOTTMAN I can-- I can't imagine a better grandma than Mary Pipher. 

00:18:35
MARY PIPHER Thank you. Thank you. 

00:18:35
JOHN GOTTMAN And Coltrane is a lucky kid. Uhm, I, I want to ah, address, ah, Don's question and I think it's, ah, what I want to say is that, ah, everything we know about well-being in mental health involves the quality of kids closest relationships. Uhm, and you know, in our research looking at parent-child interaction and kids' friendships with one another and, ah, it turns out that we can measure the parents marital satisfaction in two ways equally well. One, is giving them questionnaires that they fill out, and the other is by taking a 24-hour urine sample of their children. And measuring how many-- how much catecholamine is being secreted in the urine. The kids who are-- whose parents who are unhappily married are secreting more adrenalin and no adrenalin than the kids whose parents are happily married and this is affecting their development. So, I would spend that money, ah, in two ways. The first one is I would really try to, to create in the United States of America the emotionally sensitive school. And the school environment are-- is of-- currently a really difficult place for most kids. And if you take a look at-- I-- and we, we did some work you know, just following children in school just to see what their everyday life is like and had cameras in, inside the room-- classrooms. And it's a tough life for a lot of kids especially kids who have no friends. Kids who are rejected. Uhm, kids who are in-- even if they are not bully, kids who are lonely-- Steve Asher has found. Now, how do you create the emotionally sensitive school? How do you create the school that has no bullying, that has no racial prejudice? And how do you create a school in which kids really learn, well we know the answer. And the answer really began with work that Elliot Aronson did, a long time ago, uhm, in creating what he called the jigsaw classroom. And this is, ah, what Elliot Aronson did was he created in Houston Texas, ah, during a period of very high racial intolerance against Mexican-Americans and African-Americans by White kids and a lot of bullying. Ah, he created cooperative groups where kids had to learn from one another. So, for example if they were studying World War II, one kid in the group, in a four person group who was Mexican-American another who is African-American and not-- and two who were White. Uhm, the-- one of the kids who have become an expert on the Manhattan project the atomic project, the other would become an expert on Japan's entry into war, another on the life of Adolf Hitler and so on. And the kids work with the big kids in the expert groups like all the kids who worked on the Manhattan project, work with the teacher to become really knowledgeable and expert. And Eliot Aronson, ah, when he saw kids bullying other kids in these groups, his graduate students did not say, "Be emphatic and be sensitive." They said, "If you kid doing that you're never gonna learn how-- about the Manhattan project from Carlos if you make fun of his accent and how he speaks English and you'll fail the test." And it turned out, this cooperative education, ah, really over the period of the year ended racial press-- prejudice in the school in which of this used. And it ended bullying as well. It has been repeated as an experiment in every continent on the planet. And it has become a method of education called cooperative learning. Now, just to give you some idea of the effectiveness on education not just on the social world of children. The country of Finland had the lowest educational achievement two decades ago of any country in the world. And what they did was they changed their educational system to do two things. First, they make sure that all children were not hungry when they went to school, they fed them because many of the children came to school hungry. And second, they institute of cooperative learning. At Finland's children now are the highest achieving children in the world. The experiment was repeated in Shanghai, again Shanghai's children. A decade ago, were among the lowest in the world and now they are among the top nations. So, we know cooperative education changes the social structure and relationships of everybody in the school. And we can do this. But it's a matter of changing schools so that they're not oriented around testing and achievement but oriented around learning, learning with one another and creative learning as well. Uhm, I'll, I'll tell you about one other experiment done by a mathematician cuz now people are saying, kids need to learn in the STEM fields, you know, that-- that's about science technology, engineering and mathematics. Well, ah, man named, ah, W. Warwick Sawyer, ah, mathematician was asked by the-- by Australia about 50 years ago to train Australia's mathematician so they could become world class mathematicians. And the way Sawyer did that was that he took graduate students in mathematics in Australia. And instead of trying to cover all the math he gave them problems and they started working on the problems cooperatively. And they reinvented mathematics and of course what happened after they were done reinventing their fields rather than having them cover material they then started forging new areas and became a very creative group of mathematicians. The second thing I would do and-- in in addition of creating in America the emotionally sensitive school is to really work on parent education and change the relationships of parents, ah, with their children and, ah, you know, we know that even with even with sing-- so called single parents are 40% of, ah, children are born to single parents. But the Fragile Families Project in the United States that studied, ah, these, ah, single moms in 16 different cities discovered that 80% of them are actually involved with a man that there is a parental relationship there. Sixty percent of the time that man is the father of her-- of one of our children at least and his living with her is the romantic relationship. So we need to work on getting people out poverty. The other thing that is very important in this-- that we-- that we're now learning about is the incredible importance of fetal development, so that moms who are not, uhm, nurtured adequately during pregnancy, who are stress during pregnancy, ah, are giving birth to kids that are already at birth at an enormous disadvantage. We used to think that 50% of IQ, of intelligent was genetic. And now that we've studied the fetal environment, we now know that only 26% of intelligence is genetic. That fetal of environment is absolutely critical. Well, in my lab we can predict the babies, ah, emotional intelligence the babies ability to self-soothe, how much our baby will laugh or cry, from how the parents talk to each other about the conflict issue in the last trimester of pregnancy. That fetal environment is critical. If people are gonna get out of poverty, the mothers who give birth to children who are gonna poor have to have a pregnancy, have to have a relationship that is nurturing, have to have a pregnancy that is calm and loving. And so I would work, ah, and spent a lot of that money to change the, ah, the world of families as well and parent-child relationships. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
DON MEICHENBAUM Uhm, so I will give you Vice-President Biden's telephone number. Ah, let, let me, ah, pick up on some of the things that you said. Ah, the Melissa Institute is been heavily engaged in the process of trying to bring, ah, social, emotional learning to schools. And make them more inviting I proposed the jigsaw as well as other kinds of projects and in fact in Illinois, ah, they now have the casual project that's been mandated by the state in order to address that issue. And to downplay the notion of testing as the criterion, ah, this concept of raise to top and so forth are counterproductive. Uhm, ah, so one of the things the Melissa Institute has, ah undertaken is to target 114,000 principles in the United States. We have created a principle report card where we will, ah, try and educate. Ah, so I need Arne Duncan whoever is going to be the next secretary of education to target. Nothing happens in schools I work for 20 years in schools, nothing happens unless you have the principle on board. And therefore, you need to, ah, highlight this, ah, that the Finland data is indeed, impressive they are the number one country I just present it when my colleague Deb Pepler who spent months there and, ah, one of the things that was interesting is that there's no such thing as a special needs classroom. Okay? Every kid in Finland is treated in individualized plan that addresses that. Ah, so I-- I'm all for that, we are also heavily involved with, ah, parent training and your data about the prenatal period is really interesting. Ah, consider the fact that when you look at conduct disorder kids most of them are coming from teenage mothers. These teenage mothers becoming pregnant by whom antisocial guys. Knowing that there's data indicated, if you look at aggressive girls as by peer nominations in grade five and six. You could predict pretty well whose gonna become teenage pregnant. So, therefore you could actually have this lifespan prospective and therefore if they become pregnant you know, the key question is what goes on during that, ah, developmental phase. Uhm, so I, I, I would be clearly endorse your notion of spending the money not on mental health workers who are gonna provide tertiary. But really getting into the kind of universal and secondary high-risk populations. Ah, the, the second kind of notion this is how much we differ. So after Newtown, you took your grandson out and look at new impact it, okay. I went online and wrote an article on how to use motivational interview to change the behavior of the NRA. That's a different kind of style. No, no but seriously, I mean gun availability is one of the things that you need to address. And in fact that article on there you, you can go them and listen to two website and see the guidelines on how to find concurrent agreement and in fact in the latest, ah, annual report we did a study of NRA members and found out how much they readily endorse gun control sales and so forth which differs from their leadership. And, uhm, and, and, and hopefully, ah, that would be an important way. Ah, the problem is that in Liberty City in Overtown in Miami with the Melissa Institute they're on their rooms to go into the part of the house that's quiet. 

00:31:20
MARY PIPHER Yeah. 

00:31:20
DON MEICHENBAUM I mean these are drive by shootings, these are high-risk kinds of activities. 

00:31:20
MARY PIPHER Yeah. 

00:31:25
DON MEICHENBAUM So, ah, one of the things that happens I'll talk more about this tomorrow is, ah, we work with African-American ministers. You know, we work with the gate keepers in each community in order to find out ways to intervene along this developmental cycle in that particular fashion. Ah, I will also note, ah, you'll, you'll see this in your handout. Ah, I've also written about, ah, computer technology in the future of helping kids. And, uhm, there are couple of projects I've recently been involved and there's a website called www.reachout.com for adolescence. Ah, this came from Australia where they indicated that teenagers who go to this website and hear story telling by other teenagers, this is peer to peer counseling. Uhm, ah, about cyber bullying and body problems, you know, body image problems, parent adolescent conflict, academic that, that significantly reduced the likelihood of, of a suicide in, in that country and it now is in the United States, ah, I, I just spent the last, ah, they're, they're now creating interactive comic books for, ah, teenagers who address various kinds of problems. I've spent the last month writing the scripts for comic books on trying to embed within that cognitive behavior kinds of coping strategies, ah, there are various kinds, ah, especially for those who are working with adolescence, ah, in the back of the Anger Handbook, there is the appendix on how to take an angry aggressive youth and turn them into a social problem solving, we're trying to train principles or vice principals. You know, when these kids has said, "You're here again, have we not gone to this? Do you wanna be suspended?" As compare to how do we engage these kids in a kind of, ah, cognitive behavior or emotional process. And my colleague Jim Lawson and has made videotape, modeling films of, of those particular interactive styles. Uhm, I would also love to see Gottman develop a app, uhm, that can be put on a cell phone. So that when I am in distress with my wife and I wanted to take a time out. You know, when I say at workshops you know, you have to be compassionate, emphatic, you have to be non-judgmental. You gotta be sympathetic and my wife turns to me and says, "Why not you ever do that with me?" And I said if you paid me a $150 an hour's I would do that with you. 

00:33:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Of-- we actually have 12 iPhone apps, ah, that do things like that and you can find them in-- on-- in the apps store. 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:20
DON MEICHENBAUM Is there a way that you could have my wife put them in my stocking as a stocking stuff for, for. 

00:34:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Absolutely. 

00:34:30
MARY PIPHER You know, I wanted to say something. I wanted to say something about your question too and then - 

00:34:35
DON MEICHENBAUM Yes. 

00:34:35
MARY PIPHER I'd like to hear from the audience but, uhm, ah, ah, I think that, uhm, this couldn't be part of your bill except in a more indirect way. But one of the things that would really help the children in this country would be to raise the minimum wage. Because so many parents are working-- they're working two jobs and one of the reasons children are watching so much television much of it really inappropriate and harmful to them, is their parents have no time for the work that it takes to raise a child. So that would be really important to me. The other thing I, I think about a lot is, uhm, how much childhood has changed in terms of where attachment is the focus and, uhm, right now a lot of children by the time they're 8, 10 especially in junior at age, much of their attachment is focused on machines. Their, their, their, uhm, their, their phones, their video games, their, their computer games and, uhm, I think that-- I mean, we all know that the causes very serious problems but one of the, the things that I think I would be doing a lot of education about with parents and with schools is, is how does-- come up with a really general accepted, ah, national set of ideas. For what is appropriate with machines and when they can be use and when they can. Because right now every single parent has to duke this out on their own with their children. And of course what they're told when they try to deal with their child is I can't stop being on Facebook because then friends will talk about me or I cannot be on Friendster or whatever because then I'll be left out and, and what know-- what's been said about me by the people. So if we could-- I, I just think that somehow, uhm, things are, are just gonna get crazier and crazier for children and for adults too because adults are hook too. Until we have a sort of-- we have all of this new technology and we don't we have rules yet. And, and I think that there's probably a way, a group like the group here involved with could start setting up some rules about that which would be just wonderful. 

00:37:25
DON MEICHENBAUM Thank you. 

00:37:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Ready? Should we hear from the audience? 

00:37:30
MARY PIPHER Yeah, sure. 

00:37:30
DON MEICHENBAUM I, I, I-- let me just add one thing about the, the minimum wage in poverty. Children who come from poverty especially if they're minority and it's important to consider that in about 15 years, uhm, minority populations will be the majority in the United States. So, if we do not address the inequality gap that is becoming more and more apparent in the United States. Our children are going to suffer. And especially in terms of school readiness. So, a colleague of mine named Andy Biemiller and others have actually conducted research, we wrote a book called Nurturing Independent Learners about why smart children keep getting smarter and other children fall further and further behind. 

00:38:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

00:38:20
DON MEICHENBAUM So if you go into your local high school that teacher in the first year high school is confronting students in his or her class who differ by ready for this six grade levels. Okay? 

00:38:30
MARY PIPHER I know, I know. 

00:38:35
DON MEICHENBAUM So imagine the challenge for that teacher. These children from poverty are coming into school approximately two to 3,000 vocabulary words behind their middle class and upper class counterparts. The level of vocabulary at the beginning of school is highly predictive of reading comprehension at grade three. These kids are never going to catch up, okay. So, if you continue with the observation of, ah, John in terms of the prenatal development, okay. There is now an increasing literature by Beerman and others about how important school readiness is in the first five years. Eighty percent of the brain is going to be developed in that period of time. And moreover, I will at least highlight for you very quickly for those-- for us who-- for we who study trauma in children. There is the studies called the adverse childhood experiences scale by Felleti and others. When children are exposed to four or more of these traumatic events like sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect being raise by depressed mother going-- growing up in a home where there's marital distress, living in the neighborhood of violence and the like. If you have four or more of those kinds of things and you'll see the scale included in the hand that I put together, there are neurophysiological sequelae. So these children who have been so exposed, the left side of their brain is seven times less active than the right side. That the corpus callosum which is a connective tissue on the commissure is shrunken. That the ability to have frontal lobe function controlling the amygdala and all the emotionality there-- these kids have compromised immune systems, they're more likely to develop sexuality transmitted diseases. So one of the things that becomes important that the Melissa Institute has addressed, is that these kids need what we call metacognitive prosthetic devices. Just like kids in wheelchair need devices and so forth. So, you can actually go online and see our system website called TeachSafeSchools where we have enumerated the variety of strategies that teachers could use. There's of-- there's a cha-- a website called teach like a champion which a, a whole program now on looking at schools that are 90, 90, 90. Ninety, ninety, ninety schools are those schools who have kids 90% are poverty and 90% they're on lunch programs and the like. And these schools are producing remarkably successful academic and emotionally thing. So if we could study those schools, okay, you can actually go online and see teachers from those schools how they do it. You know, how they get compliance the way in which they teach to the whole child, ah, the way in which they do reading readiness and, and the like. So, I think that we have a pretty good feel on how to alter the trajectories here. We just need a commitment. If we could give the vote to children so that they become a lobby group in order to redirect that money then I, I think we would be-- you need to invest in the future. Maybe now we could invite the questions and comments by the-- is that okay with you guys? 

00:42:00
MARY PIPHER Sure. 

00:42:00
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. So there are some microphones here and, ah, ah, hopefully they're clear enough. Please start this off. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:42:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Can we have the lights up? 

00:42:10
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah, could we get the lights? 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Lights is now on. 

00:42:15
DON MEICHENBAUM Ah, we can give you one of the... 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN There now. 

00:42:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Can you speak directly into the microphone? 

00:42:15
JENNIFER Okay. Good morning, thank you very much this is very stimulating. 

00:42:20
DON MEICHENBAUM Please turn up the lights in the room. 

00:42:25
MARY PIPHER Yeah, go ahead. 

00:42:25
JOHN GOTTMAN In the room. 

00:42:30
JENNIFER I'll try. 

00:42:30
DON MEICHENBAUM Okay. Go ahead, go ahead and talk. 

00:42:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Go ahead. 

00:42:30
JENNIFER My name is Jennifer(ph), I'm a therapist from Canada. And I happened to also be a Christian a therapist whose a Christian, ah, the Christian therapist. And I was curious John when you alluded to the fact about spirituality and church. Uhm, my-- the majority of my practices teenagers love them, they're great, working with them all the time. And I'm wondering about integrating those rules and if any of you have any feedback about that? 

00:42:55
DON MEICHENBAUM Well, I'm, I'm, I'm giving, ah, ah, an address tomorrow on spirituality and, ah, integration with the psychotherapy and the like. And, uhm, ah, just to quickly answer your question, there are now evidence-based interventions, ah, that have good effects sizes that are spiritually oriented. So in fact, Rebecca Propst is now done a whole program on how to do, ah, treatment of depression in adolescence use-- who are a Born Again Christians. Ah, there's a separate kind of program on how to alter interventions for Latinos, ah, who are adolescents who having problems. So from my point of view-- whoops, from my point of view the degree to which you're culturally and sensitive to those issues and tailoring and accordingly would be appropriate. That's sort of my answer. 

00:43:50
JENNIFER Do either of you have anything to say? Mary, John? 

00:43:55
MARY PIPHER Well, the one thing I, I said actually when I wrote about, ah, teenage girls 20 years ago. And, and which I believe more now that I believe at the time is that development has many, many aspects you know, emotional, physical, cognitive, social and so on. But one of the aspects of development is spiritual and I think when doing therapy with teenagers whether they are Christian or non-Christian. One of the really important questions to, to talk to teenagers about is what do you-- what do you think the, the meaning of life is and, and who design the universe and, and what's that-- what's the purpose of life? And what is the-- what is the deepest belief you have that will sustain you through the most difficult times. And so you're working with a specific group of, of children in exploring those questions. But I think those are really good questions for all children and, and I, I like to see children focus on that. One of the simplest ways to-- for me to think about spiritual is if your life has too many problems for you. If, if a situation is too big for you to deal with which happens to all of us all the time, get bigger. And that's what spirituality is, is getting bigger it's having some kind of transcendent, response to pain and upsetness. So that would be how I would talk about it, it rather than in a particular you know, Christian versus Buddhist and so on. 

00:45:40
DON MEICHENBAUM Who will get the next question? 

00:45:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, adolescents, ah, adolescents want to rebel against, ah, whatever their parents belief and yet there-- they really looking for a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. So I think those existential questions are very important on-- and Viktor Frankl really talked about, uhm, what happens when the existential vacuum exist and you get, ah, all kinds of problems that come up psychological problems that come up, uhm, you know, internalizing externalizing disorders, suicide and so on. So the, the idea of, of helping adolescents create, ah, a sense of shared meaning that is their own, that is unique, uhm, that helps them individually from their parents I think this very important. So I, I'd, I'd make a distinction between religiosity and spirituality. Spirituality maybe, you know, define very broadly in terms of finding that meaning and purpose that is no so-- not just about you and hedonistic pleasure but something-- cuz the pursuit of pleasure is empty as Frankl pointed out. But the pursuit of some kind of meaning, some kind of purpose and of course it's unique to every adolescent to create that, to find that, that passion, I think it's very important. 

00:47:05
MARY PIPHER Thank you. 

00:47:10
JENNIFER Thank you. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN I have a question about prenatal development, uhm, for Dr. Gottman. Uhm, you addressed how, uhm, people in poverty have the stressors especially because of these relationships they're having. Uhm, my question is more about normal average relationships, uhm, people who are pregnant but women experienced physical stressors and normal maybe high-risk pregnancies just things that are very hard for them during pregnancy. Uhm, how does that affect the development? 

00:47:45
JOHN GOTTMAN You know, there-- there is, ah, there is an interesting book, ah, that you might enjoy reading it's called Origins, and it talks about summarizes a lot of the research on fetal development. Unfortunately, it doesn't deal with emotion or relationships, uhm, which is a big omission and a very important omission. But it will give an idea of how, uhm, how important this period is, how important that is for, ah, a pregnant woman to really feel that she is loved and taking care of and safe. And, ah,-- and how sensitive, ah, the fetuses to all of these stresses that she undergoes regardless of where they come from, where the stresses come from. So, uhm, you know, we now know a lot about this period and I think we can really make a difference. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN How could we address that as professionals? 

00:48:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Well I think it's important for our pediatricians, physicians, OB/GYN doctors to really not-- do less and other people who, who worked with pregnant women, uhm, to just really be aware of the literature. How important nutrition is, how important it is to have calm and peacefulness and a loving relationship. So it's necessary to intervene on a lot of different levels to, ah, to really change that field of environment. For example, ah, you know, we know alcohol creates this fetal of alcohol syndrome. But even if-- even if a woman drinks one glass of wine a week when she's pregnant it affects the fetus in a very big way. Ah, if she-- if she smokes, ah, you know, even, you know, a couple of cigarettes a day, it has a big impact. If her, if her marriage or relationships, ah, are strain, she's secreting cortisol which passes through the entry uterine barrier. So there-- and there are a lot of evidence-based programs now that are designed to, to help make this pregnancy period a very different kind of experience. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:00
NATASHA Hi, there! 

00:50:00
MARY PIPHER Hi. 

00:50:00
NTASHA My name is Natasha(ph) and I have a question for you that is, uhm, related to PTSD existentialism versus practicalism and gender, ah, and how gender relates to attachment. So I wanna give you an example, ah, case example very quickly and just ask you how you would deal with it. Uhm, last year, I led the group for teen parents all year. There was one male who consistently came on a weekly basis out of the group of any, any week we would have between five and 10, ah, teen parents. During the course of the year, ah, the male continually tried, will, will call him Juan(ph) continually tried to, ah, encourage whose junior high school partner he was a ninth grader she was a seventh grader 12 turning 13. Ah, continually tried to and engage her in coming the group and she came a couple of times. Uhm, and we did our best to attach with her as well. Uhm, over the course of the year it became, ah, known to me as the group of facilitator through the case manager that Juan(ph) had disclosed that in his house he had a bag with about $200,000 in cash from drug related work he had done. So, he was about to become a dad. He was very committed to coming to this group. 

00:51:45
DON MEICHENBAUM Could we ask what's your question? 

00:51:45
NATASHA And my-- sorry, my question is in a practical level. What would you do? 

00:52:00
[sil.] 

00:52:05
MARY PIPHER Well, I, I first of all I would have to congratulate for running that kind of group and, uhm, those are really difficult groups worki-- working with, with very young parents and, and there's a lot of concerns for the children and so on and so on. You know, a question like that cannot be answered in a sudden like this. Because-- essentially when I was in grad school one of my favorite teachers said the answer to every question is it depends. 

00:52:35
NATASHA Yeah. 

00:52:35
MARY PIPHER And there are so many it depends - 

00:52:40
NATASHA Yeah. 

00:52:40
MARY PIPHER - in that story. 

00:52:40
NATASHA Yeah. 

00:52:40
MARY PIPHER That the three of us there's absolutely no way. One of the things I decided early on when was speaking is when I got ask particular questions - 

00:52:50
NATASHA Uh-ah. 

00:52:50
MARY PIPHER - about what I would do or wouldn't do involving a clinical case. 

00:52:55
NATASHA Uh-uh. 

00:52:55
MARY PIPHER I would always refuse to answer him because it strikes me unless you're someone like Dr. Phil doing this for entertainment that when you answer a question about how someone should behave with another human being. 

00:53:15
NATASHA Uhm. 

00:53:15
MARY PIPHER You're taking an ethical responsibility for outcome. 

00:53:20
DON MEICHENBAUM Yeah. Yeah. 

00:53:20
MARY PIPHER So I just-- I'm sorry I don't think - 

00:53:25
NATASHA It's okay. That's fine. 

00:53:25
MARY PIPHER - probably any this will answer that question but I, I couldn't answer it. 

00:53:30
[sil.] 

00:53:30
NATASHA Okay. 

00:53:35
DON MEICHENBAUM All I know is that I'm gonna come out wherever you live and lie under the stars. I mean not only you a good writer you are wise woman. 

00:53:45
MARY PIPHER Thank you. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Hi! there. Uhm, so many of the, the issues and solutions that, uhm, you've discuss today in the panel are policy issues and our fascinating policy issues but, uhm, clinically do you have any suggestions for specific modalities or inte-- or interventions working with, uhm, adolescents with severe attachment injuries in ways to help them strengthen their EQ, uhm, so that they can avoid some of the pathologist that you sort of munched the beginning of the talk with. 

00:54:30
MARY PIPHER Well, this is a very random suggestion but a couple of things I really like to do when I had, uhm, teenagers who were not connecting with other people in the ways that, that we would help they would by 12 or 13, was encouraging to get into theater where they're actually practicing, experiencing emotions as they act. And they generally like to do that because most teenagers are a bit, uhm, self-absorbed and, and like attention and so on. And then the other thing is one of the best ways in the world to increase one's empathy and point of view, a respect from point of view, uhm, is, is literature. And so I really like having, ah, children read and talk to me about what they read and, and I took some responsibilities as a therapist for recommending books that I thought would help a particular child with a particular seven needs. 

00:55:45
C. ALEXANDER SIMPKINS So, ah, we have time for one more question. 

00:55:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, I just wanted to say that, ah, it depends, ah, on the attachment injury but yet-- your, your therapy with a adolescent is going to be a new attachment experience for them. And if they have an avoidant attachment disorder then you know, they're relying on themselves not-- they don't see other people as a source of comfort. And they generally don't have a well developed lexicon for emotions. So really teaching them an emotional literacy is an important part of that. If they have an insecure boy-- uhm, an insecure attachment that is, ah, anxious and preoccupied then again they need to of-- a they, they need a different kind of treatment and their liaison with you is gonna help them learn how to down regulate negative emotions, how to seek, you know, real comfort rather than, you know, clinging kind of comfort and how to build a sense of independence which will adolescents are gonna, gonna need to do, right, as they develop. So I think you are the answer to your own question. 

00:57:00
DON MEICHENBAUM My own-- my own last comment what I get presented with cases like this, is I, I would ask you the clinician, what this is that you like about this child? What redeeming features that she have? She is not in attachment disorder client she's a person who had a life experience that led to this and it is your job, you know, as a clinician to respond to her full persons that is, I would acknowledge and validate her style of having difficulty connecting. And she didn't get born that way she'd had have a life experience and then I would say, I could appreciate given what you've live through. How you've come to this? And what I wanna do and this is my own Colombo style, okay, is understand how you been able to achieve X, Y and Z in spite of that history. My concern is especially when I worked with adolescents is I go around they go "Hello, I'm Dr. Meichenbaum and they go, "Hello, I'm borderline personality disorder. And I say I don't know how many parents name their kids borderline personality disorder. So they become the disorder or the diagnostic category. And as John was highlighting, ah, the quality in nature of your therapeutic alliance, we just did a whole presentation on that with Scott Miller, is seven times more important than any technique you're going to use. So the degree to which you could establish, maintain monitor. The quality in nature of your relationship and the degree to which she could now evidence in a-- another settings would be absolutely critical to get her moving. So I would you know, I always ask clinicians you know, uhm, these are difficult people to work with whether you like her or not you look forward to the session. She have any redeeming value, I mean does anyone else like her. What strange does she have? Okay. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Thank you so much. 

00:59:05
DON MEICHENBAUM And then I, I would proceed from there. 

00:59:10
MARY PIPHER Thank you. Thank you all for coming. 

00:59:10
DON MEICHENBAUM Thank you very much.
