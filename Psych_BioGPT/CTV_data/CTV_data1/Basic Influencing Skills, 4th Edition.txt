MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Attending And Listening As Interpersonal Influence: Stay with the client's topic Introduction Mary Bradford Ivey, EdD, NCC, LMHC Empathy is central Listen to draw out stories The word "problem" can be negative Focus on client's issues Listen, listen, listen 

00:01:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Even though our central goal in helping, is to be client focused and to hear the clients issues from their perspective, inevitable how we listen influences what they say next and how they will frame and think about their issues. We want to tread as lightly as possible, as we listen to the stories and issues that clients share with us. Empathy and the goals of your client need to be central, when in doubt listen. My goal of this session is to do two things; first I'll demonstrate empathic listening skills, such as questions, paraphrasing, restatement, reflection of feeling and summarization. We need these skills to draw out client concerns, please note that we try to use the words concerns, issues, and challenges, rather than the more negative word, problem. The counseling and therapy field to often focuses on the negative, concerns, issues and challenges are always to describe the counseling process, as an opening for change. As a helping field seems stuck on the word, problem, join us in an effort to become more positive and more optimistic. The second goal is to demonstrate how even good listening skills can draw a client off the central issue, sometimes counselors that new use, are afraid to follow the client and thus may misdirect what is said. Carlos is coming to talk about issues of racial harassment, and you'll see me take him off topic, something that we want to avoid, if we are truly client centered. After that short demonstration, I'll again use listening, but focus on the central issue, watch for the use of skills, and how I seek to follow his main interest, again, when in doubt listen.

MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Negative Demonstration How Not To Listen: Taking The Client Off The Topic Counselor: Mary Bradford Ivey, EdD, NCC, LMHC Client: Carlos Zalaquett, Ph.D., Lic. 

00:03:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Carlos, how are you doing today? 

00:03:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Fine, Mary. 

00:03:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good. Uhm, you came in, you wanted to talk to me about something? 

00:03:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, ah, something that happened this, this weekend I have to tell you. I really feel very upset, but I was upset this time because I went to the store and I went on a weekend, trying to avoid the crowds and all that, and ah. I'm pretty much the only person in the store, I'm leaning to see something on a shelf, and then all of a sudden I noticed that there's another person looking at an item right next to mine. 

00:03:50
Interpretation via question 

00:03:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY She's looking at an item right next to yours? Do you suppose she was looking at something for herself? 

00:03:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Ah, yeah, yeah, but, but, you know? 

00:04:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I see! 

00:04:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I, I will. 

00:04:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Then what happened? 

00:04:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, ah, well I didn't make much of that, but, but, I went to the next aisle, and low and behold, here is this person looking at the item right next to mine again. 

00:04:15
Note nonverbal behavior 

00:04:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Okay, she's one of the store clerks, looking at the item you are? 

00:04:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, yeah, it looks more like a security person, I think. 

00:04:20
Topic jump 

00:04:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, you're wondering. Oh, yeah, but what were you shopping for Carlos? 

00:04:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uhm, well, I, I was trying to get a couple of things for my kids, you know, and so, that was. 

00:04:30
Topic Jump 

00:04:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY How are the kids doing, by the way? 

00:04:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT The, ah, the kids? 

00:04:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, how are your kids doing? 

00:04:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT They, they are doing very well, thank you, uhm, there, but, but, I no, I felt like, uhm, I was being followed in the store, I got to tell you. Yeah. 

00:04:45
Focus on feelings 

00:04:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Felt like you were being followed? 

00:04:45
Focus on feelings 

00:04:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. 

00:04:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And how did that make you feel? 

00:04:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, upset I guess, a little bit frustrated cuz I, I'm a professional, I don't think I should be looked at as somebody who can take something from the store. 

00:05:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No. Never. 

00:05:05
Key Points • Mary's listening style took Carlos away from central issues • Interview focused on Mary's needs MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Positive Demonstration Attending As Influencing: Stay With Client Central Concerns Just before this interview starts, Mary goes through key structuring issues with Carlos: • Signed permission to record • HIPA • Confidentiality • Legal issues 

00:05:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hi Carlos. How are you doing today? 

00:05:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Fine, Mary. 

00:05:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good, nice to see you and you know, we have just finished going through these, uhm, HIPA requirements, and you know all about the HIPA stuff, and, and you've signed a permission form, to, for the record, to record this session, and you know that everything is confidential, except for legal issues. 

00:05:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. 

00:05:45
Notes useful in first session, but obtain permission 

00:05:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Ah, and I just wanted to tell you, in these first sessions if it's okay with you, I'll have my pen and paper here and I might want to take some notes, if that's okay with you? 

00:05:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Sure. It's good knowing that it's confidential, then that's okay. 

00:05:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. And do you have any questions of me, Carlos, before we start? 

00:06:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, I, I, wonder how do you work with, with your clients or patients? 

00:06:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Well I like to work with whatever works with them, I, I'm very flexible, uhm, I, I think I know a lot about multiculturalism, I think I know a lot about listening, and, uhm, just work with whatever works for us together. So, and then before we begin, uhm, I'd like to say, you know, I'm a white woman and you're a Latino, uhm, if we have any issues that are multicultural related, I think we should just put them on the table and both of us, discuss them. 

00:06:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, thank you for mentioning that, I can't, I mean I feel, okay, but if something comes up I'll tell you. 

00:06:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Oh, good, that's what I want it to be, I want it to be a mutual arrangement, like that, so we can talk like that. 

00:06:50
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Key Starting Points • Maintain openness on multicultural differences • Allow client to ask you questions • Focus your listening skills on the client's main issues Open question 

00:06:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So we're ready to start, Okay. Uhm, what would you like to talk about today, Carlos? 

00:07:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, you know, uhm, I, I, I came because of something that happened this weekend. 

00:07:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And it had happened before, but I never find, found myself sort of, lacking words, or what to do and this is, truly because it's something, aggravated me emotionally I think. Uhm, I was at the store and , went on a weekend, and I, I, usually don't dress, you know, like, ah, on a weekday like today, but quite the contrary to that, I dress very casually. And, and... 

00:07:30
Restatement 

00:07:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You dress casually and not, not in a suit like today? 

00:07:30
Paraphrase, closed question 

00:07:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Right. And, ah, and, and I go to the, to the store earlier to avoid the crowds, but on this particular occasion, I think I was pretty much the only client in the store and I' m leaning, uhm, to see an item on the, on the shelf and then all of a sudden, ah, there's somebody leaning, ah, to look at the item right next to me. And I didn't make much of it, but then the same thing happens on the second ah, row, but then the third row, an three times in a row... 

00:07:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So somebodies following you or someone's look, looking at the same time, in the first row, second row, third row and this person is right with you, and is that a person from the store there? 

00:08:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, That makes sense, and then I saw that person right next to the cashiers when I was exiting, so that's when I, when I, I got upset. Cuz I realized that they were following me in the store. 

00:08:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It wasn't just another person, it was somebody. 

00:08:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And I was the only pretty much client, so why would they follow me, I thought. 

00:08:20
Open question, paraphrase 

00:08:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Why do they follow you, you're the only client in the store, the stupidest. Nothing else happy and they followed you to three different stations? 

00:08:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, that's why I felt that the guys were, following me because, I could steal something or because they thought that, because of the way I look I will do something to their store, you know an, and that draw a lot of remorse, ah, in my mind, because had happened before, you know, and you really don't get, I don't get that upset because of them, it's not that obvious but, this time it was, I was. 

00:08:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Very obvious. 

00:08:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. 

00:08:50
Eliciting/reflection feeling 

00:08:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And at the time how, so here they were, they're following you around station to station, I mean obviously falling you, and not just, ah, and, and, probably wondering who you were and what you were doing in there, and, an then you get to the end and how do you feel when all that happens? What kind of feelings? Very, very upset with that to happen. 

00:09:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very upset! Yeah. I felt like, uhm, I was being followed in the store, I got to tell you. 

00:09:15
Focus on feelings 

00:09:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So, you felt like you were being followed? 

00:09:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm 

00:09:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And how did that make you feel? 

00:09:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, ah, upset I guess, a little bit frustrated. Cuz I, I'm a professional, I don't think I should be looked at as somebody who can take something from the store. 

00:09:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No. No. Never. 

00:09:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Wouldn't you be upset? 

00:09:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I would be very upset. 

00:09:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, me too, and, and I was upset, exactly. 

00:09:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Makes sense. Upset so much that you're almost angry, do you think or? 

00:09:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, upset, I wouldn't say that I was that upset, but then I, yeah. 

00:09:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What, so does that happen other places, did, what else is happening to make you feel like that? 

00:09:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah. I have like three or four of those occasions, you know, in the last four years, I guess, I had them before but, you know, after a while it sort of gets to you. 

00:10:00
Client only partially explores feelings, wise not to push 

00:10:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah, how does it make you feel inside, when that happens? You're still wondering, yeah, uh-huh. 

00:10:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Thinking well. Yeah. 

00:10:05
Open question broadens issue 

00:10:05
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You know Carlos, you got some of these issues, I think one of the things, uhm, I mean are there any other things, or is it usually just this kind of thing in the store and it just, similar kinds of issues like that? 

00:10:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah I remember helping a friend of mine, uhm, he, he had a cleaning business and so on the weekends I would go out and, truly it was sort of my exercising, I would go and do cleaning with him. 

00:10:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:10:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And it was interesting because his clients would never talk to me, they would talk to him and ask him to ask me, what to tell me. 

00:10:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Sort of like you wouldn't understand or something. Except that you're the professor with all the education. 

00:10:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What I, that's my point all together, you, here, here you are you're an educative guy, and then all of a sudden, you know. 

00:10:45
Five minutes deleted as they elaborate on details of the racial harassment MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Brief Summary Drawing out strengths 

00:10:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Carlos, you've got, you've named three different incidences, that are really important to you, I mean the things that have happened, that really have bothered you. And when we have issues that bother us, I think it's important to think of the strengths that we have and I'd like to have you talk about your strengths, because that's how we solve the issues or the, or that are bothering us or that are upsetting us. 

00:11:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well I think I'm a hard worker person, you know, uhm, I'm also, uhm, quote, unquote, keep over analyzing things and understanding others. 

00:11:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Mm-hmm 

00:11:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You know, uhm, I work with people and I think I relate well with them, you know, so I get through them, and so, ah, I think that those are strength of mine, yeah. 

00:11:30
Summary of strengths 

00:11:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hard working, understanding, working with people, you've got lots, lots of strengths an, and I would add, I think you have a wonderful family too, so. 

00:11:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. 

00:11:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Ah, you have lots, and lots of strengths to deal with issues, and do, and some other strengths too, that you'd like to talk about. 

00:11:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Yeah, you know, as, as a Latino and as a Chilean, eh, we have a strong family tie and, ah, we support one another, even from a distance, we still keep our relationships, so I have a good support, ah, group also if you want to put it that way. 

00:12:00
Cultural strengths important 

00:12:00
Open question oriented to client goals 

00:12:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So your family is a good support and that ain't just the close family but, the family in Chile, is a support group, which is really wonderful. So you have many, many strengths Carlos you're very fortunate and when you think about what goals that you could, uhm, what we could do about them, what you could do about this situation, what, what comes to mind, when you think about this? 

00:12:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, one of the things is, is sort of like, ah, being able to, to calm down in this situation and address probably the situation and, you know, ah, ah, directly. But in addition to that, sometimes it might not be, ah, worth it, to, to do that, so the capacity to address the situation, but also the capacity to determine when it's more appropriate to do so and when it's more appropriate to back off and just let it go. Cuz I'm assuming things will happen no matter what. 

00:12:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Bu these things are going to go on, so you've just got to decide, when you gonna, when you gonna let it roll off your back and when you're gonna do something about it? 

00:12:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. 

00:12:50
Encouraging action 

00:12:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY What's something you might could do in the, uhm, the store for example, what could have been or might've been, or if you chose to do so? 

00:13:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well one of the things that I could've done, is to speak with the manager. 

00:13:00
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Absolutely. 

00:13:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And address the directly, and say, "This is the way I perceive the situation to be." You know, and if you are doing this to a person, you know, from a different background, but keep in mind that, we are in a city with a 24%, you know minority, ah, group, so you don't want to lose your clients. 

00:13:15
Summary 

00:13:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You don't want to lose the clients don't want to lose you, you might even, you might even tell them you're a professor at the university and this is not, ah, the way you like to be treated in the stores and this is not a store that I would like to. 

00:13:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, so gonna say. That's very true. 

00:13:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So you almost have to stand up and speak up, not only for you, but for other people that don't have the voice to speak up. 

00:13:35
Social justice and empowerment 

00:13:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT You know, that's interesting cuz that's, what, what came to my mind in the situation also, if they are doing this to me, can you imagine what may happen with person with less education and all that? 

00:13:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Right. 

00:13:45
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And maybe they wouldn't be as capable to address the issue as I may be, so I, I think hear you, is, ah, not only just for me, but also for others. 

00:13:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And you're also a wonderful writer, an, ah, I'm thinking, you might be able to write some letters to, ah, these companies, even the presidents to tell them what happens in stores. 

00:14:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Absolutely. Yeah it really is, just to show you how emotional you can get in this situation, again even think about it, but that's, an great way to go, yeah, yeah. 

00:14:20
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Carlos previously had taken too much responsibility for the harassment. Mary used social justice concepts to help "externalize" the issue. Next, Mary and Carlos together move toward empowerment -- taking action. What Did Mary Do Right? • Listened and followed Carlos' main issue • Included multicultural issues • By listening helped client find his own solutions What are your thoughts about social justice action in this session? MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development These demonstrations re for professional training and for use in skills, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped. ELICITING AND REFLECTIVE MEANING: THE COMMUNITY GENOGRAM Allen Ivey, EdD, ABPP Nelida Zamora Many positive meanings can be drawn from the community genogram 

00:15:10
ALLEN IVEY Hey, Nelly, nice to have you back, how have things been? 

00:15:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Good, thank you, how about for you? 

00:15:15
ALLEN IVEY Oh, we've been busy around here. 

00:15:20
NELIDA ZAMORA (cross-talk)You're banged! 

00:15:20
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, it's been a nice break, but it's time to get together again and ah, what's new and good with you over the break? 

00:15:25
NELIDA ZAMORA I went to visit my family last week and it was good to see them again. 

00:15:30
ALLEN IVEY Ahh, so it was nice to get back, now they're located in? 

00:15:30
NELIDA ZAMORA They're in Miami. 

00:15:35
ALLEN IVEY Ahh, wowler. There's a little a chilly in the air. 

00:15:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Mo, chilly. Yes. 

00:15:35
ALLEN IVEY Is it chilly there too? 

00:15:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Slightly, but not as cold as here 

00:15:40
ALLEN IVEY We kind of froze up here. 

00:15:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah, I heard, good thing I was in Miami then. 

00:15:45
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:15:50
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development COMMUNITY GENOGRAM: Identifying cultural backgrounds, strengths, and resources 

00:15:55
ALLEN IVEY Anyway, it's good to get started, and last week we, let me, couple before the break, we talked about you doing a community genogram, gave you some of the ideals about it. Were you able to put it together? 

00:16:05
NELIDA ZAMORA I was. 

00:16:05
ALLEN IVEY Oh, can we see it? 

00:16:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Sure. 

00:16:05
ALLEN IVEY Find out what you got there. Oh, well that's beautiful you even used the computer to make, ah, gorgeous thing for us. 

00:16:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. Thank you I'm glad you like it. 

00:16:15
ALLEN IVEY So, could you tell me a little bit about what's here? 

00:16:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Sure. I chose to include important parts of my community. 

00:16:25
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:16:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Currently and as I was growing up, that have helped shape me into the person I am today. And, uhm, this solid line symbolize positive connections, the dash line symbolized both positive and negative connections and the jagged line is more negative connection. 

00:16:40
ALLEN IVEY More negative connection out of high school, I see, so the positive there with, the university, the church, the local park and your grandparents and then your mother's home, which is the little more, up and down. 

00:16:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm, yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:16:55
ALLEN IVEY I see! Well as you know, ah, we've been talking the past, about some of the issues with your parents, but today we really want to focus on, really strengths and positives from your background, ah. So, I'd just like a, just a brief, very brief positive story about each one of these and then we'll select one or two to look at a little more in depth. Ah, so let's take the difficult one first, ah, high school with that real broken line, so it, I gather it was kind of traumatic and difficult for you, I just want briefly, one example the problem you had there, a difficulty, a challenge. 

00:17:30
NALIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. Well, when I was a senior in high school, I wasn't sure if I was going to pursue a college education, just because my family's very traditional, they're Latino. So, uhm, it's more accepted for a woman to, ah, stay at home and be a wife and not so much pursue an education. So, I really didn't have my parents and my grandparents support, to pursue that at first, so that's why my senior year was a little more tumultuous for me. 

00:17:55
Immediate move to positive meanings 

00:17:55
ALLEN IVEY A little more tumultuous? Okay, but was there any strengths, that positive things that happen, something must've positive happened, or you wouldn't even be here now? 

00:18:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. Right. Nah, I was lucky enough to have a very good counselor, in high school, who pretty much guided me in the direction that I thought I needed to go, to go, and she just put things into perspective for me, so that was very helpful. 

00:18:20
ALLEN IVEY So in the middle of some difficult and conflict you had a, actually that's neat, you found a counselor. 

00:18:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah. 

00:18:25
ALLEN IVEY Small wonder you end in a counseling field, is that right? 

00:18:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Who knew, yeah. 

00:18:30
ALLEN IVEY So even though you have that jagged line, there are real strengths there, that you came out of that, it helped you keep going, also you kind of find, that you kept going, in spite of some conflict, I noticed that, that's neat. 

00:18:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY Ah, okay, ah, actually I guess we don't need to talk too much about your mom's home, we could talk more, we've talked about that in the past. Could we kind of at least, get a sense of one of the conflictual problematic issues? Ah, now just to tie in, you did go home and visit them in Miami, were you visiting your grandparents mainly or your mother and father? 

00:19:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, My grandparents mainly, and my mom. Yeah. 

00:19:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah? And how, how, how did it go, with each of them? 

00:19:05
NELIDA ZAMORA It's good, luckily my relationship with my mom right now is much better. So, it's always good to visit her whenever I get a chance. Yeah. 

00:19:15
Reflecting nonverbal feelings 

00:19:15
ALLEN IVEY And one thing I hear, as you talk about your mom, is that, ah, even though you've, put that to the semi-conflictual thing there, I see your eyes almost dancing. 

00:19:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Do you? 

00:19:25
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, as you talk about the fact that it's going better, that really, and that feels good to me, to see it, at least there's some progress going on there. How does it feel for you? 

00:19:35
NELIDA ZAMORA It honestly feels good for me too, because throughout high school we did have a very difficult relationship, as I was growing up. But when I decided to pursue college and later graduate school, she was one of my main support systems, so. 

00:19:45
ALLEN IVEY So there is support there, in this community, as well 

00:19:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Yes, there is. 

00:19:50
ALLEN IVEY Okay. And, ah, your grandparents you picked as something very special when you were growing up. 

00:20:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm, yeah, you know, they raised me, so even though they are very traditional, very conservative, uhm, not to open minded about certain things, such as a woman pursuing a higher level of education. Regardless they've always supported me in my decisions, and they've been great strength and support to me also. 

00:20:15
Reflecting meaning 

00:20:15
ALLEN IVEY I, so they really are important to you? 

00:20:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely, mm-hmm. 

00:20:20
ALLEN IVEY Many time. Ah, you, ah, you live with them more, do you, actually live with them, did you? 

00:20:25
NELIDA ZAMORA I did. 

00:20:25
ALLEN IVEY How many years? 

00:20:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Till I was, at least 21 and decided to go to graduate school. 

00:20:30
ALLEN IVEY Wow. Oh, when did, when, what age were you when you moved in with them? 

00:20:35
NELIDA ZAMORA I was probably about, five or six. 

00:20:40
ALLEN IVEY Oh, I see, so, you were never really did live with your mother then, that much? 

00:20:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Not really. 

00:20:40
ALLEN IVEY I see. 

00:20:45
NELIDA ZAMORA I was, I was back and forth, but mainly with my grandparents. 

00:20:45
Positive reframe of meaning 

00:20:45
ALLEN IVEY So they really in, ah, some sense, really provided the critical support and while conservative, I, I imagine that word conservative, also means you can count on what's going to happen, is that right? 

00:20:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Yes. Mm-hmm, that's right. 

00:21:00
ALLEN IVEY So you can count on those people, that's wonderful. 

00:21:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. I can always count on them. 

00:21:00
ALLEN IVEY Wow, the local park, what's going on there? 

00:21:05
NELIDA ZAMORA It just brought me back a memory of my childhood, you know, it's, it was right across the street from my grandparents' house and it's not something that, you know, I really think about too much. But as I was putting this together I always kept going back to the park, good memories I had growing up. My grandfather's older now so he's not as energetic as he used to be, but I remember when he would take me to the park and we'd go on bike rides together and things like that, uhm, so that definitely made me feel good, thinking about it, I decided to include it. 

00:21:35
Visual images clarify meaning 

00:21:35
ALLEN IVEY So that, You also have that whole issue of nature, as we got people and locations and then nature and, ah, you had a particular visual image of the park when you think about it? 

00:21:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Just how tranquil it was. 

00:21:50
ALLEN IVEY Tranquil? 

00:21:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. There was always this discord between my grandparents and my mom, which of course consequently affected me, but the park was like, a getaway you know, so. It was just a calm an tranquil atmosphere, my grandfather would take me on bike rides and it was just, a chance to kind of leave the issues at home, you know, and just kind of, go on a mini vacation and get away from there. 

00:22:20
Reflection of meaning 

00:22:20
ALLEN IVEY That's a place where you could really feel at peace. 

00:22:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Yes. 

00:22:25
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development IMAGES AND BODY ANCHORING Allen next develops image more specifically. Note: 1. Stay with feelings 2. Visual image of a specific instance 3. Finding a place in body where that feeling resides 4. Anchor that positive feeling there 5. That anchor can be a resource for her working with difficult life issues 

00:22:45
ALLEN IVEY I'd like to stay with that feeling of peace, can you kind, get a visual image of the time when you were in that park an you, at a specific time with your grandfather which you felt, ah, feeling of peace? 

00:22:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, one particular instance where I felt? 

00:23:00
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, one particular day. 

00:23:00
NELIDA ZAMORA It must have been you know, when I would just take my bike down there and just go on the hills and ride back and forth, uhm. I just felt very at peace and free, to be able to do that safely with my grandfather there, so. 

00:23:15
ALLEN IVEY Could you just say that word, at peace and free. 

00:23:20
NELIDA ZAMORA I just felt at peace and free. 

00:23:20
ALLEN IVEY How does it feel when you say those words? 

00:23:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Soothing. 

00:23:25
ALLEN IVEY Soothing? 

00:23:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Relieving. 

00:23:25
ALLEN IVEY Where do you feel that soothing? 

00:23:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Where? 

00:23:30
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Physically? 

00:23:30
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:23:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Around my chest 

00:23:35
ALLEN IVEY Your chest? 

00:23:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:40
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development 1.Start with positive story 2. Single image from story 3. Positive feelings associated 4. Locate strength feeling in body 5. A resource that is always with the client 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY Uh-huh. I'm wondering at times, and every time that one of the purposes of the community genogram is to find strengths, that we get from past events or present events and then try to locate them in are body. Now can you imagine, can you imagine how your, by the way first, do you ever think about when you're in a situation of tension, ah, here, graduate school, whenever, do you ever think about that local park? 

00:24:15
Positive meaning calms client 

00:24:15
NELIDA ZAMORA I do, mm-hmm, it, this just helped me put it into perspective, because I don't realize how much I think about it, uhm. I didn't realize how much I thought about it, till I actually did this, so. But yeah I do find myself going back to those memories and those visuals and that calming and soothing feeling that I had when I was there. 

00:24:40
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development USING IMAGE IN FUTURE 

00:24:45
ALLEN IVEY A couple things for you here, first of all, just for you personally, ah, when you get, and, when you get in the future, when you get in those places of tension an exam, I don't know, in a conflict with somebody, you always have that feeling of you and your grandfather in the park and that feeling in your chest and if you take a breath, let it go, and visualize that park, that's what we call a resource. 

00:25:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
ALLEN IVEY It's always with you, ah, ah, there's a wonderful book, ah, titled, My Voice Will Go With You, and the community genogram we have lots of voices going with us and they aren't just in are head, they're also in are body. 

00:25:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:30
ALLEN IVEY And we could talk, we got also a negative knots and so forth all over are bodies, as well, but if we focus on the, on the positives, we're going to get somewhere. 

00:25:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. 

00:25:35
ALLEN IVEY Also I got to tell you I'm going to bring a little, like your, your, in counseling, ah, I've been very much into bringing the world of neuroscience into counseling. 

00:25:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:45
Positive thoughts change the brain 

00:25:45
ALLEN IVEY Now this clear research evidence, I know when people say research, they tune off, but this is good stuff and the thing is, there's clear evidence now, that positive emotions are located in the cortex, particularly in that left cortex, the executive decision making and if we think in are heads about positive things, like that, we're, we're actually strengthening and building positive neurons. And you know what those positive neurons do, we're actually changing the brain. Those positive neurons get deeper in are brain and they can overcome negative things in the, what we call the amygdala, where the sad, mad, glad, you know those emotions? 

00:26:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:26:25
ALLEN IVEY So thinking about the local park, just that one thing, and your grandfather, can help you deal with negative situations. So it's not just a cognitive issue, it's also physical, emotional issue, that's why we have the community genogram, it can be used as a real healing device, okay. Ah, now, ah, we've heard a little about your grandparent's, but can we have just one more scene from your grandparents that courage you, did you think about being there with them? I'd like a visual image, if you could this time. 

00:27:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:27:00
ALLEN ZAMORA It may be a little hard, but, may, may want to close your eyes, but just think of the time, just whatever crosses your mind. 

00:27:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Well my grandmother was always cooking, she was always in the kitchen, cooking meals for us and that's what would really bring her happiness. So, just seeing her, fulfilled and happy, you know, when she was always cooking meals for her family, brought me a sense of peace too. Because I knew she was okay, you know, so would, you know, make me happy, watching. 

00:27:25
ALLEN IVEY Ah-ha. So this, happy and where does that happy feeling come in, where does that go? 

00:27:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Physically right? 

00:27:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. 

00:27:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, My heart. 

00:27:35
ALLEN IVEY In your heart? 

00:27:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah 

00:27:40
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:27:40
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development At this here and now moment, both Nely and Allen have tears in their eyes. Sensory experiences often bring out deep emotions in surprising ways to both client and counselor. Self-disclosure and instruction 

00:27:50
ALLEN IVEY I've got to share this with you, I too have a grandmother and one of the most wonderful memories I have of her, is her baking bread. And she was from the old country and she made it, you know, when she made it, she made it for the week. But the smell and then she's, she's, as she made the bread she sang Methodist hymns. So it was this smell of the bread, every time I smell fresh bread, I think of my grandmother, and I kind of, get some of those same feeling joy that you feel. And my grandmother was always with me, and her voice goes with me, her spirit goes with me, and your grandmother's spirit goes with you, we have wonderful things, despite all the crap we deal with, and if we can focus more on those, we're going to get farther. And, ah, I really get deep feeling when I think about that, you can tell and I suspect you do as well. Okay, the church is important to me too, what happens with the church for you? 

00:28:40
NELIDA ZAMORA It was almost like a safe haven for me, uhm, you know whenever I needed to pray or again, just kind of, get away from it all and I was a little I wouldn't go to the park as often, I find healing going to church. 

00:28:55
ALLEN IVEY Healing and going to church, mm-hmm. When, when you think, most of us have visual images with the church and maybe some type of, I don't know if you had, I'm Episcopalian, and we talk about smells and bells, they also have a meaning as well. I can get images an smells and sounds as well as visual images, what occurs to you, when you think of the church? 

00:29:15
NELIDA ZAMORA The first thing I could think, I could think of is the incense burning, I always remember that smell, uhm, so even now when I, it's a different church obviously, because I'm living in a different city, but smelling that same incense just reminds me of that healing that I would get, back in the day, when I was in Miami, going to that church that I would always go to. 

00:29:35
ALLEN IVEL I've got to give you a little more professional stuff about neuroscience, the olfactory bob, bulb in are brain is the very first part of are brain to be stimulated. It's the one that touches us first, and why it goes back evolutionary to animals survive by smell, and so the issue of smell is really amazingly important role and I talked about the smell of the bread, I think some of our deepest emotions are sometimes associated with odor, aroma, and smell. 

00:30:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Right, mm-hmm. 

00:30:05
ALLEN IVEY And, ah, and actually are, are church is now a little more liberal, occasion to bring in the smells and bells. 

00:30:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:10
ALLEN IVEY You kind of like it, there's something about ritual, the repeating thing, and I'm saying myself, how about you? 

00:30:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Right. Yeah. To be honest, it does make me feel comfortable, because, I, I, always went to the same church when I was in Miami and I didn't think that I would be able to get used to a new one when I moved away. But, uhm, that first Sunday I was in town and I went, it was like, I had never left, you know, so it did make me feel at home again and comfortable. Mm-hmm. 

00:30:35
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. So one of the things we're kind of looking here at and we're looking here as you know, in the skill of meaning, and simple things that if we start asking more questions, have much more meaning and they live with us much more fully and you say, "I grew up with my, da, da, da, da, da." 

00:30:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
ALLEN IVEY If you start looking at what's really going on, that's who we are, we grew up in a community and a family, deeply affect us. 

00:31:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. Right. 

00:31:00
ALLEN IVEY So the church is there, again I'm gonna ask for you, do you get any feeling, ah, in your body, associated with that? 

00:31:10
NELIDA ZAMORA An overall, general feeling of healing and calmness, again. 

00:31:15
ALLEN IVEY The overall feeling, just everywhere? 

00:31:15
Client now finds her own anchor quickly 

00:31:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah, just everywhere, like relaxing. 

00:31:20
ALLEN IVEY I think it's one of the reasons, there's also good evidence that spirituality, church, and belief, speaks important things to mental and physical health, so you've got that asset as well. The spiritual. 

00:31:30
NELIDA ZAMORA I also feel like my minds not racing, you know, when I think about it, just more calm and less tense. 

00:31:35
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, yeah. There's a time for calm, putting yourself together almost totally, you know. What about this university, I didn't expect to see the university in here? 

00:31:45
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHS 

00:31:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Believe it or not, yeah, there's positive associations with that and it's just something that I never thought I'd be able to do, just because of the preliminary lack of support that I received from my, my family. 

00:32:05
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:32:05
NELIDA ZAMORA But, uhm, you know I did it and I did it successfully I feel, so I decided to include that on there. 

00:32:10
ALLEN IVEY Ahh. You did it successfully, okay. 

00:32:15
NELIDA ZAMORA I did. 

00:32:15
ALLEN IVEY Could you tell me about a specific success that you had, you're probably expecting that at this point, the concrete example? 

00:32:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Taking my statistics test, and passing. Uhm, Math was never a good subject for me, so I was, you know I majored in psychology and statistics was probably, the deal, you know you have to pass statistics one and two, to be able to graduate and I had a very tough professor, I didn't think I was going to be able to be successful in that class. But, I remember very specifically that, one day that I took that test and as I was taking it, I knew that, I knew all the answers, so it just, I mean I was going to pass it and I knew I was going to pass the class and that was just a very good day for me. 

00:33:00
Reflection of nonverbal feelings 

00:33:00
ALLEN IVEY Okay, so that you could, eh, yeah, I see that great big smile, and not many people smile at a statistics test. 

00:33:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Well. 

00:33:10
ALLEN IVEY Not many. 

00:33:10
NELIDA ZAMORA I'm smiling because I passed it. 

00:33:10
ALLEN IVEL You passed it, okay. And what was the, again, what, what, what words would you describe to use, that passing that test? 

00:33:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Happiness, and, ah, a feeling of success. 

00:33:20
ALLEN IVEY Happiness. Success. Success, an you're kind of wrinkling your nose, when you say success, what, I wonder what's going on there? 

00:33:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, I just, again I didn't think it was something that I'd be able to do, so almost saying is kind of, hard to except, you know, I, I can't believe. 

00:33:35
Reflecting meaning 

00:33:35
ALLEN IVEY Hard for you to except a success. Uh-huh, I kind of wonder, hard for you to except success, interesting okay. 

00:33:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Yeah. 

00:33:45
ALLEN IVEY Now that you did have success, and there's a big smile. 

00:33:45
NELIDA ZAMORA I did. Mm-hmm. 

00:33:50
ALLEN IVEY It's hard to except though. Okay, let's imagine you're, that you're really successful without the wrinkle. 

00:33:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Okay. 

00:33:55
ALLEN IVEY How does success feel? 

00:34:00
NELIDA ZAMORA It feels really good, feeling. 

00:34:00
Free association strategy 

00:34:00
ALLEN IVEY Where do you feel success? What, of the first, what other words do you associate with, with success, what other words come to your mind? 

00:34:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Aside from success? 

00:34:10
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. 

00:34:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Just a feeling of accomplishment. 

00:34:15
ALLEN IVEY Accomplishment, that not a feeling, success, what other words, accomplish, you said the success, accomplishment? 

00:34:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Accomplishment, help me. 

00:34:25
ALLEN IVEY Helping? 

00:34:25
NELIDA ZAMORA No, help me. 

00:34:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay, I'll help you, like I'd prefer they come from you, I will supply if necessary. 

00:34:35
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, accomplishment, success. 

00:34:35
ALLEN IVEY A person is accomplished, with the success, what are they demonstrating? 

00:34:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Uhm, capability? 

00:34:45
ALLEN IVEY Capability? 

00:34:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:34:45
ALLEN IVEY What else, capability, accomplishment, success, capability? 

00:34:50
NELIDA ZAMORA Ah, just feeling enabled, you know, you can accomplishing means something. 

00:34:55
ALLEN IVEY Enabled, okay, how about throw in persistence, you don't pass that exam without persistence, were you persistent? 

00:35:00
NELIDA ZAMORA That's very true. I sure was. 

00:35:05
ALLEN IVEY Is that a part of, of success? 

00:35:05
NELIDA ZAMORA I think so. 

00:35:05
ALLEN IVEY An not anymore words that occur to you, I could throw another if you don't have it? 

00:35:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Perseverance? 

00:35:15
ALLEN IVEY Perseverance, hanging in, etcetera. How about strength? 

00:35:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Strength also. 

00:35:20
ALLEN IVEY You don't, do you see yourself as a strong person? 

00:35:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Now I do, that I was able to move away, I didn't think I was ever going to be able to do that either. 

00:35:25
ALLEN IVEY Now you do? So you have accomplishments, success, perseverance, that, that one moment in university represents a lot if you look at your total community genogram, doesn't it? 

00:35:40
NELIDA ZAMORA It does, it's almost the most important to me. 

00:35:45
ALLEN IVEY Cuz you pulled it together! Where would you locate, ah, accomplishment, success in your body? 

00:35:55
NELIDA ZAMORA I guess, my mind. 

00:36:00
ALLEN IVEY Your mind. 

00:36:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Strength of mind definitely. 

00:36:05
ALLEN IVEY Strength of mind, okay. So you have, ah, peace, tranquility, ah, I suspect all those are a little bit of strength, and your grandparent's too, as you work through it, ah. 

00:36:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely. 

00:36:20
ALLEN IVEY Yeah. Support a whole wrap of things, that happened, to bring you where you are. 

00:36:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm. 

00:36:25
ALLEN IVEY My friend Paul Peterson says that, "There are many voices, speaking within us, we represent many cultures and yet, in that one particular moment." You kept all of the past an pulled it together, put a wonderful foundation. Okay, let's put this away and, ah, just look a little bit further. Ah, what does all of, ah, the community genogram mean to you at this point, as you think about it? 

00:36:50
Nely summarizes strengths 

00:36:50
NELIDA ZAMORA It just means, to me that I really did have a good foundation, growing up, because sometimes I question, "What if things had been different?" You know what if my grandparents would have been more supportive, what if, you know my mom would have been more supportive from the beginning, but I'm still here where I am today and I've been successful and I've been strong enough to do it and that kind of, just compiles, all these incidences for me. But it still helped shape me into the person that I am today, you made me see that. 

00:37:20
ALLEN IVEY So was it, sort of, kind of saying that cuz it really, ah, what this means to you, ah, is that you have a lot of supports a lot of strengths, a lot of success the accomplishments and, ah. Another word to use is empowering, and, ah. So what, go on, what else does this mean to you? 

00:37:45
NELIDA ZAMORA It just helped me, put a lot of, I guess things about myself into perspective, just even now, as we were talking about it. When you mentioned strength, and you saw me wrinkle my nose, I, I couldn't except that success and strength that comes hand in hand with that. So, uhm, it's almost like an epiphany for me, so I'm grateful for that. 

00:38:05
ALLEN IVEY I, I, I, I, feel grateful for participating, and you should take that measure and just say strength, without just wrinkling your nose a few times. 

00:38:15
Gestalt type repetition to anchor 

00:38:15
NELIDA ZAMORA Strength, strength. 

00:38:15
ALLEN IVEY Is that a joke? Louder! 

00:38:20
NELIDA ZAMORA Strength. 

00:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Hey, I like that. Okay. 

00:38:20
NELIDA ZAMORA It's all good. 

00:38:20
ALLEN IVEY Let's, let's call it for now, thank you. 

00:38:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you.

CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, ah, we have had about three sessions by now and we have worked, intensely in a couple of issues, but I've noticed after, ah, our conversation on that last session that there were two main or key issues, that we need to focus on. 

00:39:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. 

00:39:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT One was your feelings of loneliness, and the second one was feeling overwhelmed, by the recent news, ah, indicating that your father had been diagnosed with cancer. 

00:40:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:40:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT When in conversation I asked, you to do a genogram, as a way to understand what other potential resources were there in your family. 

00:40:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:40:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Were you able to do the genogram? 

00:40:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS I sure was, and I brought it with me today. 

00:40:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh that's, let's see it, please. Ah, Great, great. 

00:40:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Okay. 

00:40:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Let me understand what, what you, ah, represented in this genogram? 

00:40:25
Note Carlos' frequent encouragers 

00:40:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, ah, in the genogram, the triangles represent the females in my family and the squares represent the males, and on this side of the genogram is my mother's side of the family and and they came from Trinidad, so that is the water. 

00:40:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Oh, that's representative of the water I see. 

00:40:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah, They came over the water to the United States and on that side is my father's side of the family and, uhm, peach is for Georgia, uhm, they are from the south, in Georgia. 

00:40:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uh-huh. I see. 

00:40:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm, and if you notice, genogram much, uhm, it really helps me, uhm; find some of the issues and why I'm feeling so lonely. On my father's side of the family, uhm, at the top my great grandparents just recently passed away in their 90's and that is why the X is through them, they are deceased, uhm. My grandmother and grandfather had, uhm, two son's, and my father only has one brother, uhm, which is my uncle there, but if you notice, everyone is kind of spaced far apart on my father's side of the family, because they are not only, uhm, not very close to us as a family, but they're not very close to each other. 

00:41:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I see. 

00:41:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm, so on my mother's side of the family, however in contrast, uhm, my grandfather is, ah, deceased, I did not ever know of any of my great grandparent's on my mother's side. Uhm, my grandfather's, deceased, and my grandmother they had seven children, ah, my mom is the sixth out of seven, uhm, and that this is her right here. Uhm, if you notice this side of the genogram is pretty close together an kind of jumble up, cuz we are, they are all close, as well as, my family is close to them. So they are, uhm, very involved in are life's, uhm, very, well, very involved in gossip and everything else, so in that side of the family. Down here is my father and my mother, and my father and my mother, they had four children, I am the oldest , and then I have a brother that's right about 18 months younger than me, a sister and my youngest brother. Uhm, the arrows here shows that I'm close to this side of my family, not close to that side of my family and the sibling that I'm closest to is my youngest brother, here. Uhm, but where I feel alone even though I have all of these family members is that, uhm, this brother, my brother that's right underneath me and my father, they have no relationship. 

00:42:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Okay. 

00:42:50
SERIASHIA CHATTERS And my sister and my father they don't have a relationship, my youngest brother and my father do, uhm, and he and I also have a great relationship, but he is in college, he's a sophomore in college, so I find myself not wanting to bother him with any of the caregiving issues for my father. Even though he likes to be involved, I find myself trying to not burden him, because I want him to be able to enjoy his college years, so. 

00:43:15
Open question 

00:43:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, I, I, I, I, gather, ah, that this is a complex sort of relationship, but, what, what did you learn, by doing this, ah, genogram? 

00:43:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well what I learned, and, and just looking at this with me being down here is that I have a huge support system, uhm, even though I do feel alone, this is kind of a really good illustration that I-- This side of the family is really heavy with a lot of resources that I have not tapped, uhm, people that I've not talked to about the diagnosis, uhm, my father's side of the family, even though there far away from each other, they're also very secretive and so my father's always telling me he doesn't want anyone to know that he's been diagnosed. Uhm, but everyone in this side of the family kind of knows something is up and they've been asking me, "What's going on?" "How can we help, we know something's wrong?" And I've kind of been shying away from it, so I've, really do to tap into this side of my family for help. 

00:44:15
Paraphrasing 

00:44:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT How interesting, so what that means is that they, they, they seem to be willing to learn about and to help? 

00:44:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes they are. 

00:44:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Suggesting that you're not alone then? 

00:44:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:44:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I can see that's it. 

00:44:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. 

00:44:25
Search for strength/supports 

00:44:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, let me put this aside for a second, and ask you to, ah, think about, about this, what, what strength can you draw from your, ah, family genogram, from your, the members represented in the genogram? 

00:44:45
Keeping strengths in mind helps deal with issues 

00:44:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well, one thing that I can definitely draw from which I have, I feel very lucky to have, is that a family that is close together, we bond together, uhm, we are able to, we face a lot of other issues together. However, uhm, I know that with this recent diagnosis, I've kind of closed off because I didn't want anyone to know, my father didn't want anyone to know, but what this, this strength that I'm really drawing from is how close we are and how we can deal with things as a unit, instead of dealing with things separately and so I really need to reinsert myself back into my family unit and draw from that strength. 

00:45:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Great, and I also notice that, that there was a similar, ah, sort of finding in relationship to your own sibling, to your own family, so let me see if I can, ah, suggest you something. 

00:45:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes. 

00:45:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Would you, when you, uhm, think about that if, you're feeling lonely for example, by now you realize that you were taking a lot of responsibility in this, when in fact you have a community behind you, your family behind you. 

00:45:45
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. Yes, yes 

00:45:50
Note how cultural style relates to client issues 

00:45:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Uhm, and, ah, in addition to that, that you can draw some strength, from your family, specially the, the, the side from Trinidad. 

00:45:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Yes 

00:46:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT And, ah, the question is, what kind strength or what kind of, ah, resource specifically do you think you can utilize from this relationship with your family in Trinidad? 

00:46:10
Seria moves to strengths and away from "problem" 

00:46:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well the resource that is to ask for help, uhm, most definitely, uhm, a lot of times my mom and I, we try to balance things between the two of us on, my aunt will ask, "Can I come over?" "Is there anything you need, need to do?" And my mom will be like, "No!" And what I really need to do is, talk to my mom and tell her that when my aunt asks if she can come over or if she can help, is to actually reach out for help and to say, "Yes! Please come over, cuz we need a break." "We need some time away from the house." Uhm, it also made me realize that we have, meaning my family, my, my immediate family, has let this thing between my dad and my, my brother and my sister and my dad, go on to long and then we just kind of excepted it, as that's it they're not ever going to come together and for us to have four siblings and only really one sibling taking care of my dad, we really need to bond together as siblings. And so, I really think that I need to call my brother and even see if I can get him to come down to talk to him about what's going on, so. 

00:47:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So we have now two sets of potential actions to be taken, the question is, will you do it? 

00:47:25
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Yes I will, I, I, have to, I really do have to, because I can't do this by myself and I, I know that it's unhealthy, for me to continue to do this by myself. 

00:47:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Well, I, the, the, I think that this is a, ah, good moment to summarize and adjourn, but with the commitment of coming back and revisiting this potential, ah, actions, to see if you were able to implement them and to the, tell me what kind of outcome did they produce. 

00:47:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Yes I definitely do need to come back, because I, I might need some help getting those relationships started, so. 

00:48:05
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, very good, thank you. 

00:48:05
SERIASHIA CHATTER Thank you. 

00:48:10
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Now, let's see how Carlos uses the strategy of FOCUSING to help Seria restory her issues from a more positive perspective 

00:48:20
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Seria, we have, ah, ah, an interesting conversation and, and drawn, uhm, uhm, big amount of information from the genogram. 

00:48:25
SERIASHIA CHATTER Yes. 

00:48:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, let's start broaden up this, this, ah, ah, understanding of your situation, by focusing on different dimensions. 

00:48:30
SERIASHIA CHATTER Okay. 

00:48:30
Eliciting feeling, FOCUS ON CLIENT 

00:48:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Let me ask you first, how's all this making you feel? 

00:48:35
Family issues can be complex, Search for strengths 

00:48:35
SERIASHIA CHATTER Well, uhm, as you can see in the genogram, how distant my father's side of the family is, uhm, the way that I feel about that is, I feel really, it, it helps, it helps to exacerbate my feelings of loneliness, uhm. I feel as if, I would like to tell my grandparent's what is going on with my dad and I would like to go to them about it, but there's so many issues going on, on that side of the family. Uhm, there's they're very southern, uhm, traditionally southern, and it's kind of like, one of those things where, when I try to talk to them about how overwhelmed I'm feeling, they try to, take it to religion and religion is going to take care of it all, when you really don't need to worry about that. On my mother's side of the family, we are very close, uhm, but with it being a Caribbean background, a lot of taking care of someone, is, it's your responsibility, so it's, shouldn't be viewed as a burden, it's your responsibility, that's just what you do, you take care of your elders when they're sick, but if you complain about it, all in a sudden you're ungrateful and that there's something wrong with you, because it's becoming a burden. So, looking at these two sides of my family, even though I'm really close to one side, uhm, sometimes it's difficult to go there and say that I'm feeling burdened, because I'm not supposed to feel that way, as far as, that's the way that, that side of the family looks at it. 

00:49:55
FOCUS on Cultural Context 

00:49:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So you are drawing most of the, the strengths from you Trinidad side of the family, and they seem to be related to some sort of, ah, ah, sort of a cultural perspective, cultural background. 

00:50:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes. 

00:50:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What specifically from, from the cultural perspective helps you in this? 

00:50:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well the part that helps me is that, uhm, I'm lucky that, that side of my family does view taking cares elders, of your elders as a responsibility, because a part of me knows that it doesn't matter how sick my father gets, uhm, I'm not going to be trying to put him in a nursing home or get rid of him, wherever I go he's going to go, and it's kind of natural to do that, almost, uhm. On my father's side of the family, uhm, my great grandparents were in a nursing home, uhm, they only came home to my grandmother's house when they could no longer afford to be in a nursing home. So kind of the nursing home thing was kind of, ah, you know, the first resort instead of the absolute last. So, I feel comfortable taking care of my dad, and, uhm, I think a lot of that comes from the fact that, I was primarily brought up Trinidadian, so yeah. 

00:51:05
FOCUS on family 

00:51:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT That's when you, you, you get that, that strength, that type of approach to, to taking care of your own and taking care of fam. 

00:51:15
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Mm-hmm. 

00:51:15
CARLOS ZALAQUETT What about the rest of your family, what does the rest of your family say, your immediate family? 

00:51:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Uhm, not much. My, my brother that's right under, underneath me in age, he will say, "Well I'm glad it's you and not me." You know those kinds of things, and my sister, she is 21 and if that says anything about her or her age, most definitely she's kind of, here and there and everywhere. She'll stop in every once in a while, but I don't really think that my sister has a gravity of the diagnosis to, help her, as of yet. Ah, and my younger brother, uhm, I talk to him all the time and I had, kind of drawn back from that lately because I don't want to burden him, but he comes home every time he gets a chance, he's always home and he's always trying to care. Him and I, seem to be the most familiar, uhm, and also the most caring for my father, both of him and I view it as a responsibility not a burden. And so I find myself thinking I can't wait till he graduates and he's can get out there and get a job and help, uhm, cuz he and I, even though we're ten years apart, we're the closest together, so. 

00:52:25
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So you, you see him as (inaudible ) outside support person, you work with him closely but, but he's away? 

00:52:30
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Oh, most definitely. Right. 

00:52:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT But when he comes he helps? 

00:52:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:52:35
FOCUS on cancer impact on client and family 

00:52:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, what does the diagnosis of cancer, have meant to you and to the rest of the family? 

00:52:40
Seria FOCUSES on meaning to herself FOCUS moves to family 

00:52:40
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Well there's so many different dimensions in it, uhm, for my mom it has, it has meant a change in what she has viewed to be what, she thought she was going to retire and her and my dad were going to travel and none of that's going to happen anymore, because my dad can't travel, uhm. For me it's very nerve racking, because I wonder is it hereditary, am I going to get it? Uhm, I find myself often when we go to his appointments, asking his doctor a ton of questions, "What can I do to prevent this from happening to me?" Uhm, because I wouldn't want my husband to have to take care of me like, I, my mom has to take care of my dad and coincidently I do. Uhm, and for are familiar unit, are, my immediate family, I think it's kind of distanced us even more, because for my brother who isn't helping, I find myself resenting him, because it's like, you have graduated, you're working just like I am, uhm, what makes you so special that you don't have to come home and help take care of dad, but I do? And so there's a resentment there underlying, I haven't said anything about it, but there is a resentment and I don't think I really verbalized it until today, that I do kind of resent him. That he gets to go on and have fun, and I'm home taking care of dad, so. 

00:53:55
FOCUS on client's feelings 

00:54:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I can see. So let, let me focus a little bit more on that, on that, feeling of resentment, ah, ah, tell me more a little bit, explain to me a little bit more what does it mean to you? 

00:54:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Well I think that, uhm, just, I mean as an aside, I think that my brother, uhm, being a boy it's kind of like one of those things where you're a man you don't really have to, but it's the responsibility of the girl to do it and I am the oldest. And so, I have that addition of being the oldest and the, the woman and a part of me says that, "You know this is a responsibility you've taken on yourself; I mean you really didn't have to." But, another part of me, which is my, probably my Trinidadian side says that, "You had to, it wasn't, there was no choice." And so, I feel as if there's no choice and I guess why I resent him, and now that I think about it, is the fact that he was able to make a choice and he chose not to be involved. 

00:54:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Mm-hmm. Now, he chose, to not, to be involved, you perceive that to be the case, uhm, so is there a chance for you to speak to him about this, ah, cuz sometimes it may not be necessarily a choice, it may be that his concern about the situation, also may not know how to react to it. 

00:55:10
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. Right. 

00:55:10
FOCUS on counselor through brief self-disclosure 

00:55:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Ah, to, to give you an example, in my own personal, ah, experience, I've struggled when my own father was diagnosed with ah, with, ah, very severe illness. I didn't know how to deal, ah, what to do and how to go about helping, but I also, uhm, didn't realize that some of my own siblings were experiencing a similar struggle and so could happen with other members of your family. 

00:55:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Mm-hmm. Right. Right. 

00:55:40
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So, it is possible that by engaging in a conversation with them, you may find some different dimension, like we did today, like this ideal of the resentment, ah, I mean not this ideal, this feeling of resentment and it could, ah, be an important discovery, cuz it can help you then to find other ways to go about it, other ways to cope with it uhm. 

00:56:00
Seria discovers a way to restore he situation 

00:56:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right. And I, I, never thought about it that way, I, I never thought about the fact that him not taking care was probably because he didn't know, how to and, I mean in all reality, what I could probably do is to give him some ideals as to how he can help. Because how I help is going to all the appointments, but I do live here and he doesn't and so, that's probably, he doesn't know how he can help and so we could probably talk and I can say, "Well you could help me by." And give him some examples, I never thought about it that way. 

00:56:30
FOCUS returns to client, Seria 

00:56:30
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good and you can also feel, ah, concern about, would this counsel also fake name? 

00:56:35
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes, yes. 

00:56:35
Acknowledging feeling 

00:56:35
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Which is an important concern, and I realize you have the same concern, ah, but in your case, you have been proactive in finding out, and how to prevent it, if that is the case, but may be your brother, ah, may not feel comfortable doing that. But, still have a hold of that feeling inside himself. 

00:56:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right, the fear. 

00:56:55
Summary and plan for next session 

00:56:55
CARLOS ZALAQUETT So there are a number of other, ah, ah, elements in the remain, ah, in dimensions in this situation that need to be explored. 

00:57:00
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Right 

00:57:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT I'm glad that by now we understand that you are not alone and that you have resources. 

00:57:05
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. 

00:57:10
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Now, what we need to do in future sessions, is continue exploring the different dimensions of your current situations an different ways to cope, ah, and manage them. 

00:57:20
Seria has restored her issues in this session 

00:57:20
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yes. Yes, and in, in, in just this session, has been very helpful, because now that I realize that some of the feelings that I do have, it kind of gives me a better opportunity to try to resolve some of those issues that I never really thought were issues. And so, and it kind of has damaged my relationship with my brother, cuz him and I used to be really close and so I do need to, uhm, do that and I think I should do that after I leave this session, before I lose the gaul to do it, so. 

00:57:50
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Very good, I think it's a great way to, uhm, think of goals for this session, and I appreciate that. 

00:57:55
SERIASHIA CHATTERS Yeah. Yes. 

00:58:00
CARLOS ZALAQUETT Thank you. 

00:58:05
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The client has developed a new story in this session. Drawing on strengths and focusing on multiple dimensions of the complex issues has been helpful. FOCUSING Telling the Story from Multiple Perspectives It will help if you FOCUS on multiple issues 1. The client 2. The issue, concern, challenge, or "problem" 3. Significant others (e.g. family) 4. Mutual focus and immediacy 5. Interview focus 6. Cultural/environmental/contextual issues MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development These demonstrations are for professional training and for use in skills, theories, multicultural, and practicum/internship courses. The demonstrations present situations that viewers may encounter in real life. All demonstrations are role-played with volunteers who gave their informed consent and willingness to be videotaped. 5-POINT CLIENT CHANGE SCALE The CCS helps you evaluate where the client is in the change process. Level 1. Denial Level 2. Partial examination Level 3. Acceptance & recognition, but no change Level 4. Generation of a new solution Level 5. Transcendence You can use this scale to assess two important dimensions of interview process. 1. Long-term change in client over several interviews. Use this information to assess interview effectiveness and client growth. 2. The immediate "here and now" client reaction to your interventions. Use your observations to note the effectiveness of what you said. If your intervention is ineffective, intentionally change your comments to help the client continue exploring issues. Example 1: Illness of Grandparents Client change over several interviews In this vignette, we see DENIAL of the facts and emotions (Level 1) 

00:59:40
S. KENT BUTLER So you said you have a lot going on in your life right now, so what else is going on? 

00:59:45
NELIDA ZAMORA I just got off the phone with my grandmother and she told me that my grandfather's been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. 

00:59:50
S. KENT BUTLER Wow, that must be a heavy thing for you right now, so how you dealing with that? 

00:59:55
NELIDA ZAMORA I'm not really worried about it, I'm dealing with it, cuz it can't be real, I know that's not true. 

01:00:00
S. KENT BUTLER So you're not dealing with it, you mean, you, you don't believe that it's true? 

01:00:00
NELIDA ZAMORA No at all, that can't be true, he's very healthy, there's no way. 

01:00:10
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development In this second vignette, we see PARTIAL EXAMINATION of the facts and emotions (Level 2) Also called "bargaining" and limited exploration 

01:00:15
S. KENT BUTLER So I've been thinking about you over the past couple of weeks and I'm just wondering, uhm, how are you dealing with grandfathers diagnosis? 

01:00:25
NELIDA ZAMORA He still has a diagnosis of prostate cancer and I haven't been dealing with it too well. 

01:00:30
S. KENT BUTLER What do you mean by, not dealing with it to well? 

01:00:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Every time I think about it, I just get so scared and angry, I don't understand why me, why does it have to happen to me, when he such an important person in my life. 

01:00:40
S. KENT BUTLER Okay, so tell me a little bit about the anger and what you're scared about. 

01:00:40
Fear and anger common in incomplete examination 

01:00:40
NELIDA ZAMORA I just can't deal with it in a constructive way, I'm scared of what's going to happen to him, I'm scared of just letting the anger over take me and it shouldn't be happening to him, I'm angry at the doctors. What do they know anyway? 

01:00:55
S. KENT BUTLER Okay. 

01:01:00
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development In the third vignette, we see ACCEPTANCE & RECOGNITION (but no significant change) of the facts and emotions (Level 3) 

01:01:05
S. KENT BUTLER So you've been spending a lot of time in, in the hospital with your grandfather as of late, so how are things going for you these days? 

01:01:10
NELIDA ZAMORA It's been okay, I have to do the best I can to deal with it, I'm still scared and I'm still angry sometimes, but I'm just doing the best I can, I'm being there for him and supporting him. 

01:01:25
S. KENT BUTLER So, what's changed over the past couple weeks, in terms of how you are starting to see this situation? 

01:01:25
Note more emotional balance and acceptance 

01:01:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Well after a couple weeks I've realized that, that diagnosis isn't changing and there's an operation that's coming up pretty soon, so I just want him to be okay, I'm just trying the best I can. 

01:01:40
S. KENT BUTLER So what are you doing to prepare yourself for this operation? 

01:01:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Familiarizing myself with what type of operation it's going to be and what the operation entails. I've gone to speak to the surgeon and I know that he's a good surgeon, so I feel better about it. Mm-hmm. 

01:01:50
S. KENT BUTLER Good. I'm happy for you. 

01:01:55
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

01:02:00
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development In the fourth vignette, we see the GENERATION OF A NEW SOLUTION (Level 4) 

01:02:05
NELIDA ZAMORA So, I have something to tell you. 

01:02:05
S. KENT BUTLER Okay. 

01:02:05
NELIDA ZAMORA The operation went really well. 

01:02:05
S. KENT BUTLER Excellent, excellent. So how are things going for you now? 

01:02:10
Nely finds new ways to deal with situation 

01:02:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Well I'm still frightened about it, but after talking with the surgeon, he says that the cancer will most likely clear, so I think the best way to deal with how I feel right now, is to continue to exercise and meditate and to join a cancer support group, to help me in it. 

01:02:25
S. KENT BUTLER Mm-hmm. All right, so have you been doing anything in terms of finding a support group? 

01:02:30
NELIDA ZAMORA I have. Uhm, the hospitals have a couple of suggestions of support groups, that I could start going to, so I think that'll really help a lot, to talk to other people, that have been through the same type of thing. 

01:02:35
S. KENT BUTLER Okay, great. So how, how's your relationship with your grandfather, how are you, what, what other types of things do you do and talk with him about? 

01:02:45
NELIDA ZAMORA Well I think We're closer than ever now, just because I was so much of a support to him and he can't speak English so, I've been able to translate what the surgeons says to him and he's better able to understand what's going on, so he's. 

01:02:55
S. KENT BUTLER Mm-hmm. So he felt more a part of what's going on and more, more connected? 

01:03:00
NELIDA ZAMORA Absolutely, yep. 

01:03:00
S. KENT BUTLER Excellent, that sounds really good. 

01:03:05
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development In the final vignette, we see TRANSCENDENCE (Level 5) This level of change happens relatively rarely and represents a major change in thinking and feeling 

01:03:15
S. KENT BUTLER So your grandfather's home now, and everything seems to be going well, in that regard, so how are the support groups going for you? 

01:03:20
NELIDA ZAMORA They're going really well, these past couple months have been a really difficult time for me, but thank you for helping me through them and the support group has made a tremendous difference. 

01:03:30
S. KENT BUTLER In what ways have they? 

01:03:30
NELIDA ZAMORA Well talking to other people that have been through the same thing, really help and they even asked me to take leadership over it, so I'm very excited about that and I think it will be a good thing. 

01:03:40
S. KENT BUTLER So what's exciting about the leadership role? 

01:03:40
Major change from original denial, fear and anger 

01:03:40
NELIDA ZAMORA Well just that I get to reach out to others who are struggling with the same thing that I struggled with, such as, negative thinking, uhm, for a while there I was even like, well cancers genetic. What if something like that can happen to me? But talking to these other people, that have been through the same thing, it's just made me more optimistic and have something to look forward to. 

01:04:00
S. KENT BUTLER So you're not so much concerned about your own health as, as you were, when we talked earlier, when you were like, scared, that could happen to me 

01:04:05
NELIDA ZAMORA Right, mm-hmm, not anymore, it's helped a lot. 

01:04:10
S. KENT BUTLER Okay. I'm so proud of your growth in this area, so that's good. 

01:04:10
NELIDA ZAMORA Thank you. 

01:04:15
S. KENT BUTLER So what's going on at home with, with your grandmother and grandfather? 

01:04:15
NELIDA ZAMORA There well, my grandfather's healing and the cancers cleared, so, uhm, it's all good news. 

01:04:20
S. KENT BUTLER Good, excellent. 

01:04:25
NELIDA ZAMORA Mm-hmm, thanks.

MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Training Example 2: Teenagers dealing with classroom conflict The immediate "here and now" client reaction to your interventions Level 1: Client here and now DENIAL of issues 

01:04:40
ALLEN IVEY Alexis, what's up? The principal just sent you down here, what's going on? 

01:04:45
ALEXIS Well I did nothing, I mean I just walked into the cafeteria and my friend started yelling at me. 

01:04:50
ALLEN IVEY You say you did nothing, I don't even know what went on, I just know you got sent here, what happened? 

01:04:50
Denial 

01:04:55
ALEXIS Well, we got into this argument and it was over something really stupid, and all I did was just slap her, I mean I did nothing. 

01:05:00
ALLEN IVEY Ah, okay. 

01:05:05
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Level 2: Client PARTIAL EXAMINATION of issues in here and now 

01:05:10
ALLEN IVEY Now Alexis I can see that you were pretty angry and I can see why. Ah, how you thinking about it now? 

01:05:15
ALEXIZ Well, I think she was still in the wrong, like all the way, but maybe I shouldn't have walked in and slapped her, but it's, she deserved it. 

01:05:25
ALLEN IVEY You feel she deserved it, but you're really still pretty angry with her. 

01:05:25
Some admission of participation in fight 

01:05:30
ALEXIS Yeah, I mean she walked in and she's the one who started the argument in the first place, I did nothing. 

01:05:35
ALLEN IVEY You did nothing but slap her? 

01:05:35
ALEXIS Yes, well I probably shouldn't have done that. 

01:05:40
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:05:45
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Level 3: Client here and now ACCEPTANCE AND RECOGNITION of issues, but still no change 

01:05:50
ALLEN IVEY You know, Alexis as I listen to you, I can really understand why you were so angry and were pushed into slapping her. At the same time, ah, I see a little change in you now, how are you seeing the situation now, could you kind of summarize how you see it now? 

01:06:05
ALEXIS Well, I think I probably should have talked things out with her, instead of slapping her, that was not the best course of action, uhm, but, I don't know, I think we were both in the wrong. 

01:06:15
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. Both. 

01:06:15
ALEXIS And I would like her, for her to apologize to me, but I think I should do the same for her. 

01:06:20
ALLEN IVEY So really you just got to, gonna have to deal with the situation and recognize that both you blew over the top a little bit. 

01:06:30
ALEXIS Yes. 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY Okay. 

01:06:30
ALEXIS Yes. 

01:06:30
ALLEN IVEY I like what I'm hearing Alexis, it sounds to me you're looking at the situation a little bit differently, ah, how do you see it now? 

01:06:40
ALEXIS Well I think, I should take more of the responsibility for now and I need to go apologize to her and, uhm, really handle myself better, even if she did say something that really made me angry, I should not have slapped her at all. 

01:06:50
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. So it looks like your anger is really justified, but slapping her is a little bit more than what she said. Is that right? 

01:07:00
ALEXIS Yes, yes. If I really have a problem with her I should, you know, cool off and then sit down an talk with her; and not just burst out and slap her. 

01:07:05
ALLEN IVEY I like that. 

01:07:10
MICROTRAINING And Cultural Development Level 4: Client here and now GENERATION OF A NEW SOLUTION 

01:07:15
ALLEN IVEY Alexis, we've been talking now for almost a half hour and I see you looking at the situation very differently, what sense, what meaning, do you make of it now? 

01:07:25
ALEXIS Uhm, that I just really need to control myself better and if people do something to me I just, I need to control myself and not do anything and slap them, that's not the best thing to do. 

01:07:35
ALLEN IVEY Mm-hmm. I also hear there, that you'd like to do a little work on, ah, looking at, sometimes you been angry in other situations, I hear you kind of want to work on that too. 

01:07:45
ALEXIS Yes, this has really helped me to learn what those other things that come up in my life, just to, really control myself better. 

01:07:55
ALLEN IVEY And also got to say, just as I've worked with, I'm very impressed that you could, look at that situation so quickly, so well. How do you feel about yourself that you're able to move from, "I didn't do anything?" To saying, " I do need to work on myself." How do you feel about yourself? 

01:08:10
ALEXIS Well just having an open mind and realizing that, you know, you definitely could be in the wrong and that even if other people do stuff to you, you don't like, it, you need take the ownership for whatever your part was. 

01:08:20
ALLEN IVEY Sounds like you're going to be able to deal, I like it. 

01:08:20
ALEXIS Yes sir. 

01:08:25

When, when there's a situation that I really believe I should do something, I, I'm capable of doing it, there are important things that I don't need to get all wired up, on this one, uhm, really coming down and understanding , that sometime people will do things, that, that are not necessarily intentionally bad, but they are, but none of those deserve, get all wired about, or all stressed out about. You know in a sense you pay with your own body when you do that and they don't deserve that, that payment anyway.

Confrontation: Supporting While Challenging Norma Gluckstern Packard, Ed.D., LMHC Ralph Packard Negative Confrontation: What Not To Do 

01:17:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Morning, Ralph, I, I received a message on my voice mail from you, that you want to talk about something this morning and, ah, just wonder what it's about. 

01:17:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, basically I want, I wanted to follow up on what we, we did, ah, a week ago, in reference to the issue I had with, ah, my father an, and how it, ah, affects me or how I think it affects me. And, and I don't think that I really got much out of the last session, ah, for myself and you know, some of it was, you know, I understood an then there was part of it I didn't really, really get and I guess I'd need some, some clarification, ah, so more, you know, meat on the bone, to say, so, say, you know, I need something else, other than what I get in the last session. 

01:18:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Hmm. Well, I sort of think that's, maybe your fault Ralph, I mean, you just don't put any meat on the bones. 

01:18:40
RALPH PACKARD Well I try, I mean, I, I did the best I can, I mean what do you expect? 

01:18:45
Negative confrontation 

01:18:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, you just talk to me about this, an then you go off on something else. You never seem to be consistent, so I'm trying to understand just, is this how you look at things? 

01:18:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, quite frankly, I didn't come here to get in a contest, with you over these, this issue. I came here to try to get some clarification and, and a more understanding. 

01:19:00
NORM GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, and the more we've been doing this, the more you are always end up blaming me and saying, it's my fault, because I really don't think you're working at it. 

01:19:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, I don't think you shouldn't have sensitive about those things, I'm the one that's coming to you with a problem and now it sounds like you have the problem. 

01:19:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, I, I just don't know whether, this is getting us anywhere, because all we're doing is arguing with each other. 

01:19:25
RALPH PACKARD Well, then what do you suggest? 

01:19:30
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Confrontation: Supporting While Challenging 

01:19:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Ralph, I received your message on my voice mail, and something about the, what we've talked about and I thought that the, what we talked about, I thought it went well, but I hear you, you didn't and I just wondered what was the problem. 

01:19:45
RALPH PACKARD Well, I thought it went well, but when I left here, I guess I kind of like, ah, developed or kind of had an empty feeling that, that I'd left something behind, that I didn't fully explore or, ah, or, you know, get to where I can understand it or, and I guess that's what I, I (inaudible ). By the way do I call you Norma or do I call you doctor or, well what do I do, I mean? 

01:20:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, that's an interesting thing, I'm certainly comfortable with you calling me Norma, but maybe you'd rather call me doctor, or what's your, what's your comfort about that? 

01:20:20
RALPH PACKARD I would prefer not to call you doctor, if I could. 

01:20:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I'd be fine. 

01:20:25
RALPH PACKARD So just if I have to refer to you by name, I'd say Norma. 

01:20:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD All right. 

01:20:25
RALPH PACKARD All right, Norma. 

01:20:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD All right, so. 

01:20:30
RALPH PACKARD Well I thought are session last time, went, went well, but I, I kind of got the feeling that, that I wasn't really getting any kind of, ah, inside or anything out of that and. 

01:20:45
Paraphrase 

01:20:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD So what I hear is that you didn't think there was any substance, in what went on, in that you want to keep looking into a little bit deeper or get a little bit more understanding what the problem is with your father? 

01:20:55
RALPH PACKARD Well, part of it may be me, because I don't think I'm looking for, ah, the same thing that you think I ought to be looking for. I just want some kind of peace of mind, as in reference to, ah, my own personal feelings, not, ah, I'm not interested in, in much else, I'm interested in. 

01:21:15
Early challenge 

01:21:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But, on the one hand, you say, you want to get peace of mind, but unless you're willing to explore, it's going to be difficult to get peace of mind. That's, that's what I feel you resist. 

01:21:25
RALPH PACKARD Whatever is, whatever we have to do to get there, you know, I'm, I'm willing to, to, to do that. So, why don't you just, ah. 

01:21:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD All right, so you'd be comfortable if I, to, or what if he's like, ah, was is you talked about your relationship with your father and how that affected you. 

01:21:40
RALPH PACKARD Sure. 

01:21:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD That was about your father, while on the other hand I began to think, and I think that's what caused the issue a little bit with us. Is that you were thinking about, the relationship you have with your children and that, I think maybe that you felt that I was bringing it to a different level. 

01:22:00
Client challenges counselor 

01:22:05
RALPH PACKARD Well, I didn't feel that, but, you know, perhaps you're, perhaps you're right. Could you tell me why you came to that, ah, position, ah tell me some more, I, I don't, I don't quite understand what you're. 

01:22:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, you know, you're suggesting that I explore, I think that, what I would like, for you and maybe think about what, what'd you think I meant by that, I think that would be helpful. 

01:22:25
RALPH PACKARD Well my relationship with my children is, is, ah, is distant. 

01:22:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay. 

01:22:30
RALPH PACKARD Ah, they live in different parts of the country, as you're aware of, and I do, I don't see them that often, ah, and as I explained, you know, I'm, I was more interested in what they were doing. And it somehow didn't, you know, coincide with what I had in mind for them to do. 

01:22:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD So, what I hear you saying is that, ah, that you had certain expectations and yet, in some sense, they, your kids aren't really even, either living or living up to your expectations, am I saying that right? 

01:23:05
RALPH PACKARD Absolutely, yes, yes, yes. 

01:23:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD And, and how is that affected you as you, think about that? 

01:23:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, it makes me feel like I'm, ah, failure as a father and, ah, ah, you know, I, I guess that I maybe was operating under the misconception that, that I was a good role model for them. And that, that I worked, I worked all my life, I worked very hard, ah, and I thought that perhaps they might notice that and, ah, and pick up on those, ah, habits or role model and, ah, I don't think they did. And now I'm faced with, I think they have other expectations from me now, which I don't want to actually get in, you know, get involved with. 

01:23:50
Confronting discrepant expectations 

01:23:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Oh. So they have expectations or you think that, on one hand, I hear you saying, you had certain expectations for them, which, and they didn't live up to, but now there having expectations for you and you wonder whether you're going to be able to live up to them or whether you want those expectations. 

01:24:05
RALPH PACKARD Quite frankly, I think they want me to help support them. 

01:24:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Wow. 

01:24:10
RALPH PACKARD Which I'm not, ah, you know, terribly thrilled with doing, my father didn't do that for me. 

01:24:15
Confrontation and failure to generalize 

01:24:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay, so that's the connection with your father, on one hand your father did, in one hand; there was things your father didn't do, that you thought would be good. But in the other hand, he gave you some very good values, that you preceded to, that you've continued with and somehow you've not been able to translate that to your own, I guess son's, is that your sons and daughters or. 

01:24:35
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, all of them, yeah. 

01:24:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Well, where do we think we go from there, I mean that, maybe what I should say is, do you feel that, that we've really hit the substance or there's more to it, in what we're talking about? 

01:24:45
RALPH PACKARD Well I don't think I'm, I, I, I, I, find it very difficult to be terribly open about this, you know. 

01:24:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I sense that, I sense that. 

01:24:55
RALPH PACKARD And, ah, so you know, ah, maybe I need a little bit of, you know, prodding to, but I, I am willing to talk about it, otherwise I wouldn't be here. 

01:25:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD All right, then, then let's talk more about it, let's, let's explore, is it your son, I think I heard you say, it was sort of, more from your son's than your daughters , that the expectations, you, that they haven't lived up with to. 

01:25:15
Discrepant feelings about children 

01:25:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, perhaps I had different expectations for my son's than I did my daughters. My daughters, by the way happen to be, they both have jobs they've been working for almost 20 years now, at the same job, and, ah, so I kind of, you know, I kind of feel good about that. But I don't feel good about, ah, my son's, I had, I had other expectations for them. 

01:25:35
Confronting summary 

01:25:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Uhm, you don't think those, you don't think that, that you need to reevaluate those expectations, in terms of maybe, asking more from them, then they really can give at this point, you've come to that point in life, where you want to come to some peace, with, with wherever they are and where you are? 

01:26:00
RALPH PACKARD That's exactly what I want, I want to be able to free myself up of the feelings that I have about this and, and just kind of, say, "Okay, so that's who they are and where they are and what they're doing and, and that's the best I can accept." And if, if one goes on the premise that love is unconditional, for a child ah, then, ah, it's very easy for me then to make a stage left on that and say, "Fine, you know that's it." But I just somehow can do that superficially, but then after a while I start, I'd start thinking about (inaudible ). 

01:26:38
Confrontation 

01:26:38
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD And, and I hear that, that you, that if love is unconditional, something you're quoting from and you'd like to believe that you could do that, but you're finding it, that, that's your conflict, you can't really, doesn't really work for you? 

01:26:45
RALPH PACKARD Yeah, absolutely. 

01:26:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD How does, talking about it, you talked about it before, this conversation we're having now? 

01:26:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, it's, it's, ah, it's kind of a relief to, to, ah, if it worked, I don't know what you can say, feel good, but it, it's, it's, ah, it, it's, it's feels okay to talk about it and, ah, and get it out, rather than, than holding it in, and, ah, that's something that's never been easy for me to. 

01:27:10
Gentle confrontation challenge 

01:27:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I sense that, that, that you're being able to talk about it, but you haven't come to some peace with it yet and that maybe this is sort of, just beginning to look at this in a way that you haven't, done that before. 

01:27:25
RALPH PACKARD Yeah. Well, I don't, ah, I may not have much more time, I mean, you know, ah, sooner or later you know, you, you gonna go to the big condo in the sky or you're gonna make a, you got to, ah, just . Yeah, so, I would like to not have to go through whatever time I have remaining, ah, with this kind of, ah, that's why I'm here, that's what, what this is all about. 

01:27:50
Summary 

01:27:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD So, the, this is just a couple of issues, it came about, first talking to, about your father, and then in some sense, you, he didn't have enough expectations for you, that you probably could accomplish more had he, in some ways been such a, he was such a giving man. 

01:28:05
RALPH PACKARD Yes. 

01:28:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But, the, the maybe he should made some more demands. 

01:28:10
RALPH PACKARD I think he was too good of a father, on one hand, but then on the other hand he was not so good, because he didn't demand the, you know, some, ah, higher level of accomplishment on my part, that perhaps I could've, ah, provided. 

01:28:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Yeah. But the common. And now you have your own children, your own son's and your. 

01:28:25
RALPH PACKARD And it seems like the whole thing is just kind of, like. 

01:28:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Reversed itself. 

01:28:30
RALPH PACKARD Reversed itself and, and in a sense is repeating. 

01:28:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD How, when you say repeating, what do you mean? 

01:28:35
RALPH PACKARD Well, it seems like the same thing is going on, I'm in the same position now, that he may have been in, he probably didn't even know it, ah. 

01:28:45
Confrontation 

01:28:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD For you? Oh, well there, there, there's a couple of, I see a couple of options, that you, that you have some understanding of it, but you're not at peace with it. 

01:28:55
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development Confrontation summarizes the conflict. The client examines his father's incongruities and how this pattern might be played out differently now. 

01:29:00
RALPH PACKARD Right. 

01:29:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Or that, that's one option, just say, "Okay, I understand it and I'm at peace with it." On the other hand, "Maybe would I get more peace if I had that conversation with my son's or with ever talking about this with them?" Before as you read, as you mentioned go to the condo in the sky, do you think it would be easier, or not even any easier, but help, better for you, to have that conversation with them, that you're having that you never could have with your father? 

01:29:30
RALPH PACKARD Maybe, maybe, I'm not sure. 

01:29:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You're not sure? 

01:29:35
RALPH PACKARD About that. 

01:29:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Maybe that is something you could, since this is the first time you really talked about this, maybe we need some more conversations about it. To be able to think about, what would it be like having this conversation with any of your son's. You're smiling. 

01:29:50
Client identifies situation more clearly 

01:29:50
RALPH PACKARD Well, yeah, it, it, it, it perhaps wouldn't be pleasant for, ah, because I'm sure they have a lot of, ah, of anger towards me or some frustration, ah, of things that maybe I didn't do, that they thought I should do, ah. 

01:30:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But. But maybe that, maybe that's not so bad, maybe that anger should come out, if, if, if there could be a dialogue. I mean one of the things you might be fearful of is that it's just going to turn into what you said, a lot of anger on your part and on their part. 

01:30:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, I think it's very, maybe very selfish on my part, I feel that I shouldn't have to have; carry this burden. I made an effort to, to, ah, provide a role model for them, I supported them, I took care of them, I did the best I could with them, ah, and, ah, they don't seem to be any, ah, any reward for that. 

01:30:40
Confronting reality 

01:30:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You just brought up another issue, which you said reward, that, that's, that's, ah, kind of, heavy word. Are you looking for them to give, give you something back, say, "I appreciate you?" 

01:30:50
RALPH PACKARD Sure, sure absolutely. 

01:30:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I can come up with another, are you fearful that, that might not happen is that... 

01:30:55
RALPH PACKARD It's not going to happen, I've pretty much decided that's not going to happen. 

01:31:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay, so, in some sense you're sayings that you've relieved yourself of some of these things you're thinking, but you're not going to really take it to the next step. 

01:31:10
RALPH PACKARD No, no I don't think so. 

01:31:15
MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development The client has moved some from his original denial of responsibility. We would call this partial examination of the issues. 

01:31:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD And you know, I think we need, and this is, on one hand, I hear you say no, but then on the other hand , I hear you, it's almost like you sighed and said, you gave up, I had, had a sense of giving up. 

01:31:30
RALPH PACKARD Yes, (inaudible ). I've, I think I've kind of given up, but that. 

01:31:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD It's still bothering you. 

01:31:35
RALPH PACKARD That's not a good place to be. 

01:31:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Ah-ha. That, absolute what you're saying, so maybe we can talk some more the next time we talk and talk about getting to that next place, so that, if you decide not to, you can do it feeling comfortable. But if you start to do it, then we, then you talk about what are expectations would be if you do it, to talk to your, to the, particularly to your boy. So I imagine maybe even some of, your daughters might like to, maybe they want to express some good feelings about you. I think one of the things I hear, is that you're fearful that it's only gonna be all negative and I have a feeling that maybe there's going to be some positive. Just getting to know you, I can sort of feel that there's going, there's some good stuff there. 

01:32:15
Client returns to some resistance 

01:32:15
RALPH PACKARD Perhaps, yeah, I , I. 

01:32:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You are very, every time you say, perhaps, I have the feeling that you're well. 

01:32:20
But he continues examination 

01:32:25
RALPH PACKARD Well, you know, I'm not sure, it's, ah, ah, you know, and I can't, I don't want to make a judgment on what other peoples families are like or anything, but I would make the assumption that, that children, you know, like I guess I express certain things that I thought were valuable, ah, that my father and I did together and places that we went, things that we did and so on. 

01:32:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Okay, (inaudible ). 

01:32:52
RALPH PACKARD And the support that he gave me, ah, I expressed that to him, I don't, my children I don't see them doing that, I haven't seen them do it. 

01:32:55
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But, well and in some way they may not, but you have you given them the chance? 

01:33:05
MICROTRAININGAnd Multicultural Development Interview ends shortly after this. A segment from the follow-up interview 

01:33:10
RALPH PACKARD Norma, ah, last week when we, ah, finished are session, I left and I thought about something you'd said and so, it just so happened Christmas day, ah, my youngest son called me and so, I figured that'd be an ideal time for me to, ah, maybe, you know. So I started to talk to him and, and he's been going through a, kind of a , ah, situation with a divorce, with his custody of his children, everything, so I talked about that with him for a few minutes, tried to be supportive and whatever I could do to, to help him. Somehow, I don't know, I must've said the wrong thing and the next thing I know, ah, we were into a very negative conversation, which ended very abruptly, with me hanging the phone up and that was the end of that conversation. 

01:34:05
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD All right, how do you feel, about what happened and? 

01:34:10
RALPH PACKARD Well, in one sense, I feel good about it that, ah, I said something when I hung up, that I really wanted to say for a long time and which I won't repeat here. But I did say it, and, ah, and I kind of felt pretty good about that, later on I didn't feel so good about it and I guess I'm kind of right back where, you know, I was walloring around before with that kind of issue and, ah, it's at the same place now, that it was. And I think, ah, I don't, I think it's almost irreparable right now, I don't think we'll get back together, talking again, it's that feeling. 

01:34:45
Focus on here and now reflection of feelings 

01:34:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD How do you feel, right now, how do you feel about it? Cuz I think that's what we need to talk about. 

01:34:50
RALPH PACKARD Well. I'm, I'm about ready to say, "If that's the way it's going to be, that's the way it's got to be." And, and just let the relationship go and, ah, that's the end of it. 

01:35:00
Gentle confrontation: Incongruity his acceptance of situation 

01:35:00
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You know, I hear you saying that, but your whole being, I watch you with your foot, I watch that you really don't, that you really don't want to leave it, that that's the way it's going to be, that you're not comfortable leaving it that way. 

01:35:15
RALPH PACKARD Well, I just wonder how much more of myself have I got to give to get some, some kind of, ah, positive interaction with him going. Ah, it, it doesn't seem to work and, ah, I can't continue to, ah, take that kind of abuse, ah, frankly, I don't want to, nor do I suspect I should have to. 

01:35:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD So you have expectations from him, if you do something for him this expectation and he's back to you. 

01:35:45
RALPH PACKARD Well, there's some history there, there's some history there. I had the same situation with my father. 

01:35:50
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Oh, all right. 

01:35:50
RALPH PACKARD And him and I, had very strong words and, and I went north and he went south and that was the end of it. And finally after six, seven months, ah, my mother called me and she, ah, was crying and carrying on and she said, "You know, your father is an old man and you've really got to, you've got to give, you've got to talk to him, you've got to talk to him, don't expect him to come to you, cuz he's not going to, he's stubborn." And I, you know I understand that, I guess I have some of the same, yeah. 

01:36:25
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD I was going to say, that you maybe have some of the characteristics. 

01:36:25
RALPH PACKARD So, maybe that's, makes sense. So, I did, I called him and I said, "Look, you know, we had words, we had a bad time, ah, we ought to get together and we should talk about this." And, and he agreed, and, ah, and we did and we kind of resolved it and after that, it was fine. 

01:36:45
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD You know, I see what you're saying, but I think I hear you saying, that as a role model you did this and you're expecting your son to be the same role model, he may not be. Did, the expectation is that he will come back and talk to you, do exactly what you did with your father. 

01:37:00
RALPH PACKARD Do I expect that my son, to call me and say, "You know, I, dad I'm sorry that some of the things that I said, ah." I don't expect that, no. 

01:37:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But, that's what you want. 

01:37:15
RALPH PACKARD Of course. 

01:37:15
Confronting on willingness, impact scale, full examination 

01:37:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD But, if you don't, so that, as long as you got, what your expectations are, you know in some sense they won't be met, but that's what you want. So how do we balance that, what you, the expectation and what you want? 

01:37:25
RALPH PACKARD I think that's why I'm here, I expect to hear that from you. 

01:37:30
Counselor self disclosure 

01:37:30
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Ah, but, I can't, I might solve that problem differently. It, would you like me to tell you what I would do, when I have some of those issues or do you? If that's important to you, I will, because I've has some of those issues, but for me and I'm a different person, I don't have expectations for my children, I hope they will do what I want them or what I, what I, what my inner expect, I have inner expectations, but I'm grateful if those expectations are met and sometimes they're not. And so that's a very different, I, that's a very different way of looking at it, if that's what you really want to hear from me. 

01:38:10
RALPH PACKARD Are, are you saying that, that, ah, there's something wrong about having expectations for children? 

01:38:20
Continuation of self-disclosure 

01:38:20
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD No, but I'm saying that, that if you don't have these expectations for your kids, it's easier for you, it's easier for me and so I don't get disappointed, when they don't perform, that's what I'm saying. 

01:38:35
RALPH PACKARD Oh, I see. 

01:38:35
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Because sometimes they don't perform, but I think that, that, that's me, and that may not be you, that, that's asking me to share something. 

01:38:40
Impact Scale Continuation of full examination 

01:38:40
RALPH PACKARD Well that's sounds, very good, if I could get, maybe get, if I, if they could say to me, or one of them even, just said, "Look, you know, this is where I'm at and this is who I am and this is the best I can do and, and I don't blame you for it, I don't hold you responsible for, or anybody else, it's what I didn't do in my life that's caused this, not what you didn't do." But I don't think that's going to happen. 

01:39:10
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD That, and that may not happen, I know that may not happen. 

01:39:15
RALPH PACKARD All right, so. 

01:39:15
Gentle confrontation Exploring other options 

01:39:15
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD So, you have to find some peace for yourself, that's what I'm feeling now, that if you don't, and then sometimes I think what happened with your younger son, you may not be, be, that you can do that with him, but I know you have a couple other son's. You think that maybe you need to have that conversation, cuz I remember we talked that, the conflict between you and your younger son has always been pretty tough, but what about your two other sons, where you don't have that? 

01:39:40
RALPH PACKARD Possibly I could do that with, with the, my oldest son, yeah. 

01:39:40
NORMA GLUCKSTERN PACKARD Yeah. And, and maybe that's, you know sometimes we have to live with what we can have.
