JEFF Okay, I as an organizer of the conference, I get to choose the people who I want to introduce and wanted my first selections withheld and Bill has been really a friend, a brother for many years but for mutual interests with Milton Erickson brief therapy publications and Bill is one of the most talented and amiable and enthusiastic presenters. He is always one of our most highly rated speakers. He is going to be speaking with us about two very important concepts in brief couples therapy, acknowledgement and possibility. It's a lecture that I haven't heard before, so I'm very much looking forward to learning from him and I can say to you that we save the best for last. You're going to be delighted and educated and I'm sure that you'll enjoy what Bill has to offer us. So please join me and warm welcome to Bill O'Hanlon. 

00:02:05
BILL O'HANLON Thank you so much. Thank you Jeff. Jeff and I were just reminiscing of how we both studied with Dr. Erickson in 1970s and what a long strange trip it has been, we were, Jeff had hair out to here and I had hair down to here at that time. I'm still handsome here, I'm still handsome here, yeah. All right, so acknowledgement and possibility in couples work, I think like most of you, one of the first things that really, you know, that I learned as a counselor, as a therapist was Carl Rogers and he was so great, wasn't he? You know, he was just so loving and kind and accepting to people and he taught us the basic thing that anybody needs to do who does counseling or therapy which is to listen to people empathically to view them with positive regard and to validate what they feel, do you know their felt experience and who they are and all that stuff and that was great. And I really liked it but I found some limitations with it so I added another part to his acknowledgement and validation piece in this presentation. Two things that occurred to me, the first one was that I was working in a community mental health center at the time and I remember a woman coming in for her about 22nd session and I remember hearing myself say and so you're depressed again this week and she nodded and I nodded and she felt totally accepted and understood and she wasn't changing, but she loved to come in every week because she got that warm support and that was important and some people getting that warm support, they just go off and change and that's it. But some people they just get the warm support and they really don't change. So the second limitation that I found is when I started doing couples work, I was trained as marriage and family therapist in systemic approaches. When you have one person in there, it's a little easier to just do that acknowledgement stuff, you got two or more, a family, a couple, and they are off to the races and you're just you know, yes, and you acknowledge one person, the other person gets pissed off. What are you taking her side for or his side for? You know, it's not as easy so I thought I just kind of get us into this moment for why I've added this second piece to what I think was Carl Rogers essential contribution to articulating what most of us do really well, which is this listening and validating and acknowledging. So some of you came to my presentation the other day and I used movie clips to illustrate what we're up against with couples therapy and how that helped couples move. So there is kind of a little repeat for those people over there. This is from the movie The Ref, some of you've seen it, Denis Leary and Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey and Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis play this couple that's just like the couple from hell. They can't stop bickering even when Denis Leary who is this robber gets stuck in a New England town on New Year's eve after his getaway car takes off and he gets -- he trips the burglar alarm when he is trying to do a big heist. He kidnaps this couple so he can stay in the town and find a safe place to stay until he can get his getaway car driver back and this couple is the couple he kidnaps and they are the couple from hell and he threatens to kill them if they don't stop fighting. That doesn't face them, you know. And finally, he says I can't believe it, I kidnapped my parents, you know. So here is the couples therapy, in which the couples therapist has been taught a simple model of getting them to communicate and just listening and you'll see the limitations of this with some of the couples with whom we work. All right, here we go. 

00:06:15

00:08:30
BILL O'HANLON So couples come in and they want you to take sides, they want to tell you who is right or what's wrong, you know, and who is wrong and that doesn't usually help them, I've noticed and so let's go on with their couples. 

00:08:50

00:10:35
BILL O'HANLON Part of the session allied with one another, so that's good. So, Carl Rogers was great influence on me and then the next influence was Erickson. Erickson was a guy who went for change. He undermined your current reality and invited you to a new one pretty quickly and so you know it was confusing to me after I studied with these two people and after I learned couples therapy and I thought I've got to find a way to kind of meld the best of Carl Rogers and meld Erickson to do this kind of inviting people to change pretty quickly and joining with them and validating, and listening to them deeply and not judging them and you know, moving them on somehow sort of the mutant child of Carl Rogers and Erickson was what I was looking for, how do you validate while inviting change and bridge between problems and solutions because of all you do is acknowledge people and validate them, they'll often stay with the problem. And if all you do is challenge them and invite them on, you know, those people are provocative therapists and they just trying get people change, sometimes they get a lot of pushback because people don't feel heard and understood and they feel too threatened and I don't think we do too well when we are so threatened. To me, it's like curling, I've never played curling and I don't, to tell you, I don't even know what the point of it is to tell you the truth. But I've seen it on the Olympics and they push this puck and this big stone I guess they call it and they sweep in front of it and that's the way I think about therapy. To me, successful couples therapy and all therapies stands on two legs. One is you want to join with people be right in there with them acknowledge and validate and the other is you want to invite them into possibilities and if you only lean on one leg, you're going to be unstable, it probably won't work. If you lean too much on the acknowledgement leg though and don't put in any possibility, they probably will stay where they are, if you lean too much on the change, you might lose them because you haven't joined them, you haven't heard them, you haven't acknowledged them, you haven't accepted them in some ways, so curling the analogy is you're sweeping right in front of the stone, you have to pay such close attention to where they are, the clients, that you have to sweep open possibilities right in front of them if you have a different agenda and you say, okay, tell me about your childhood and that's not where they are, tell me about your parents' relationship, and that's not where they are, you're sweeping in a way that doesn't make any difference for the stone. You want to open up a path right in front them and I've discovered having used this stuff and I'll tell you some methods of doing this for long time is the couples would tell you when they're ready to change, how? They'll stop complaining about the other and about the relationship and about the past so much and they'll start talking about what they want and what could happen. They'll start giving hopeful, you know, things that they'll tell you rather than just the complaints and how bad it is. You can't tell when that's going to happen, you just keep sweeping open possibilities and they say well you know, we're hoping that we can you know settle things without arguing so much and all of a sudden you hear the first sign of hopefulness. They'll tell you when they're ready to move on that is when they felt heard enough, accepted enough, validated enough that they're ready to consider new possibilities. So, that's analogy that I use. It's important to join with people and this is a challenge with couples therapy and including their negative feelings and points of view without invalidating the other person and while you're inviting them out of discouragement and into hoping change and so how do you do this? I've a bunch of methods and I'm going to tell you the first method. The first method here is when people, when couples tell you about their problems, unless they're doing them right in front of you, like he never listens and he'll say yes I do, clearly he listened to that. So my thought is put it in the past where it belongs. Maybe he hasn't listened sometime in the past or a lot of times in the past, so I just it in the past tense, which isn't a big change but it's a little change. I say, so he hasn't been listening to you. Now, that may not seem like a big change to you, but what that does is it puts the problems in the past and keeps the possibilities open in the present and the future. So that's the simplest one and is one that most of my couples don't even notice, and sometimes I do this a hundred times during the first session, and at the end of it they say, you know, nothing's changed but we feel more hope. Now maybe just by coming in to see somebody they feel a little more hope but I've also seen couples sessions where they feel less hope at the end of the first session, right. So I think this is one of the ways that get some crows. Okay, the second method of acknowledgement and possibility at the same time, doing both at the same time, is you notice when couples get into, when anybody gets under stress, I think, we tend to generalize. She is controlling, he never wants to do anything. They tend to go global. And there is no possibility in that, it's like he is never going to change, he's never going to change, this marriage is over, this relationship is over, there's no love here anymore, they globalize generalizations and what I do is, I do Carl Rogers with the twist with this, I reflect it back to them what they just said, but I put in a little possibility by saying so pretty much you have the sense that most of love if not all of it's gone. I hear how that's different from there's no love in this relationship. There's a little possibility in there and sometimes they'll say no, there's no love, there's not even maybe, you know, it's done. But most of the time, they'll just accept that as a pretty close approximation to what they just told you except what I've reflected back to them has a little possibility in it and I do this again 20, 30, 50 times during the course of a conversation in the session and by the end of it, there's a little opening typically. So global to partial, even if they don't use global terms like always, never, no one, you know, everybody, I use terms like rarely, usually, typically, almost always, as far as you can remember, the what? Oh, sorry, I heard a phone, I'm here and it was talking to me, and so the third one is, yes. 

00:17:35
 Can you just say how you say it? 

00:17:40
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, so she always has to be in control. So pretty much all the time, she needs to be in control. Now that pretty much softens it, just a little or he never listens. So he hasn't been listening to you very much at all. You can barely remember a time when he has listened to you. Or there's no love in this relationship, so in the last while really there hasn't been much love in this relationship. So either make it more, a little less globally in the time that is recently, in the last while, or I make it less global in scale. Everyone to most of it, nobody has ever loved me. Very few people have ever loved you. All right, and this third one then is you validate the perception, but you don't agree that that's the unchanging truth or reality. So your sense is she needs in control most of the time or even she needs to be in control all the time. As far as you can see, he is called with everyone that he knows. You get the difference between he is called, when you reflect that and he is sitting over there and he doesn't agree with it. I was showing a clip the other day and I said so you get the sense that you know that he just wants to be in control and he goes, I don't like this control thing, I don't believe in control. And you can tell they had that discussion once or twice about him being controlling. And it really pushes the button so when I'm trying to validate her, he is over there listening saying you're invalidating me, because I feel blamed, unaccepted. So I say so your sense is that he needs to be in control and I see him start to react and I go and your sense is that's not an issue for you, that's an idea she has about you. And my goal is to get both of them nodding at the same time. To start to create that context of acceptance, they're not probably going to do with one another right away because they're so pissed at each other, so discouraged at one another, so disappointed about what's happened that it's hard for them validate one another especially if the point of view is about them. And it's a little balmier invalidating or it's not so complementary and usually when they're under stress, they'll go right to the less complementary theory about the other person or label about the other person. So I've got a very quickly join both of them and open a little possibility or they're off to the races like they do at home, you know, like they have their typical argument at home, I've got to intervene somehow. All right, so somehow, I've gotten these mislabeled, this is number four, possibility method number four, map problems and solutions. One of the things that happened for me when I came to study with Dr. Erickson is he wasn't at all oriented to diagnosis or pathology. And I was saying the other day, I was in a year-long psychotherapy course, a pro-seminar when I was a graduate student and we had to choose our favorite approach to psychotherapy and do a 40-page paper about it and when we got to the end of the year, I realized I've chosen Erickson, I was in trouble. I went to the teacher and I said, you know, you said 20 pages has to be on the person's theory, the approach's theory of psychopathology and 20 pages has to be on the theory of intervention. I'm doing Erickson and I cannot find a theory of psychopathology. I can find a small one that is people are little rich and they should be more flexible, that was the bid and that took about a paragraph to say. So I had, so she gave me permission to write thirty nine and a half pages on his theory of intervention and one half page on his theory of pathology. So what happened for me is, I learned from Erickson to go for the resources. Even in the problems, he would find the strengths and abilities and solutions there. And I became a much more solution-oriented therapist, and I wasn't so interested in just hearing about the problems but of course when your clients come in, they're interested in talking about the problems because that where their suffering is, that's where their tension riveted. So what I learned to do is marble in assessment about the problem with assessment about the solution. So they don't just go into the one place so I like, what I learned in undergraduate psych school is that the more you're in one still like you're depressed it's hard to remember happy memories. If you study in a blue room, and you go back to that blue room, it's easier to remember the stuff you studied. It's state dependent they say, it's sometimes environmental, it influences sometimes internally influence by what state you're in, when you have an experience, it flavors what you think of and how you perceive things and how you remember things and most of the time in psychotherapy, in a couples therapy, we're talking about problems. So what comes out? They look problematic and they remember a lot of problems about their relationship, they don't remember much in the way of good stuff, what worked, when they felt love, I don't ask my couples when they first come in for couples therapy, do you love each other, because they usually they say no, at least one of them will say no because they can't remember that love, they're so pissed off or disappointed or discouraged that they don't remember that so I want to marble in some of those brain circus, if you want to think about brain science that have pathways about good memories and joy and solutions and good times with the couples. And what I do is like I make a map of problem land for the couple and a map of solution land and then we go back and forth during assessment and of course I want to see if I can import things from solution land into problem land. All right, let's say, one particular couple tells me his problem land, we have problems, there's usually loud voice tone, we have arguments in the kitchen to the bedroom, it's usually the evening and there's eye rolling, sarcasm and this one couple said, he is lawyer-like. He like grills me during an argument and he interrupts me, all right good so. Tell me about a time when you resolved the problem where you've gotten a long better or so earlier in your relationship and things were going better, and they'll describe softer voice tones they usually had discussions in the car or walking around the neighborhood, interestingly when they didn't have eye contact. What do you think? You know, we're supposed to, you're supposed to have eye contact and really now, actually for this couple, they had better discussions when there was an eye contact. So they will teach you their solution, not the one you thought with your theory. Morning to early afternoon was a better time for them to have discussions for some reason, who knows why? They didn't have eye contact because they said and there was patient listening and gentle humor rather than that sarcasm. So there I go back and forth when I'm doing the assessment and all of a sudden they start to remember better times, other times and they typically start to soften towards one another. So that's another way of doing this acknowledgement possibility. Here's an example with a couple that I was working with that was, one of them was having what she called mini-meltdowns, where she just freak out with her, go to bed, wouldn't talk to, they wouldn't talk to each other for two days and we were trying to work on so that didn't happen so much at all anymore. Let me just. 

00:25:25

00:25:40
BILL O'HANLON Sorry, I should have given you a little more introduction. So I said tell me about a time when you start to have a conflict and then it sort of melted away. And you didn't get into your meltdown and so they said we can remember two incidents like that and they started to tell me about one and one was, Amy, who is on your right here says during the middle of an argument she said, shh, you're getting very ugly. Now the way Amy remembered it, it was the humor they got her, because she is a very funny person. She thought I kind of joked her out of it. But her partner said, no it wasn't the humor, it was that you were quiet and you touched me in that gentle way because Amy, she can get really loud. It wasn't the humor, it was the soft touch and the soft voice. So now they're telling me a little about what worked while they're telling me about the problem in a weird way. So let me play a little more of this. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:29:05
BILL O'HANLON So we got to that and I won't show you anymore of that but essentially she said that would make much, if you could say in a soft voice, I'm really angry with you, I'm not going to leave today to really shh you. That would really make a big difference to me and if you accompany it with a soft touch, that would do it. I will calm right down, we could go on with the discussion, or you could leave if you needed to, it's what the other partner like to. Amy liked to leave to get a little distance from it. So they are teaching me what works and what doesn't. I'm hearing about the problems and I'm also hearing about the solutions. That's that acknowledgement possibility we were talking about. Okay, next method, the fifth method is, this is something that I learned again from Erikson. Erikson said if you don't say the no, the patient will say the no. And so Erikson had all these weird ways of doing it, because he was a weird guy. He would say you really want to change, do you not? You don't think you can save this marriage, do you? He would say the yes with the no. He said if you don't say the no, they will be compelled to say the no and convince you of the no. If you argue too much they should stay together, they will jump on the other side of the seesaw and say, no we can't be together. So you can get yourself in that position of getting stuck with their no. So there are simple ways to do this and as I said, Erikson did it with tag questions. You really want to change, do you not? You are not sure you can change, is this not so? You want to change and you don't want to change. You are hoping against hope, the things can better, right? You can have these slides, you don't have to take picture, if you want. I'll give you the slides, that I would put in my website in a couple of days. Maybe you shouldn't change yet, that's what DMRI people used to do. They'd say, I don't know if you should change yet, before you figure out what's been going on. There is sort of a yes and a no in that. Erikson used to say to people, don't tell me everything this first session. I think you should hold some things back. And they would like rush to tell him everything. And so, maybe there are some benefits to not changing. Let's talk about what you are getting from the way things are before we go about helping you change. Sometime ago I was at a big mental health conference and I was giving keynote address, and the other guy who gave a keynote address at the banquet in the night was a historian, not a therapist. This is mental health conference. He was talking about Lincoln's depression, he had written a book called Lincoln's Melancholy, which I recommend to you, if you've never read it. I was stunned by this talk that he gave because Lincoln was a really great -- he was good at this including the no, because he'd had so much suffering in his life, when other people suffered, he didn't just say cheer up, he would join them in their negativity and wipe them out, because he was also an optimistic guy for as depressive as he was. He almost killed himself twice during depressive lessons in his life. And so the historian is giving this talk and he reads this letter that Lincoln sent to someone who lost her father, who was one of his Generals in World War -- in the Civil War and it was right in the middle of his subordinates, really busy and he found out this woman and fallen into a deep depression in the ten months since her father had been killed in the war and her father was a friend of his and he'd known this young woman and she was in her early 20s and she hadn't gotten out of bed for like ten months. And they were really worried she was wasting away, they were worried she was gonna die, and they said will you write a letter, and he sat down and penned this letter. I was so stunned by this -- by the acknowledgement and possibility, the yes and the no in this letter, I'm gonna read it to you. Dear Fanny, it's with deep grief that I learned the death of your kind and brave father, and especially that it's afflicting your young heart beyond what is common in such cases. In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all. And to the young, it comes with bitterous agony, because it takes some unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. Now so he normalizes her grief. This is the way of the world, people die, terrible things happen, he knows this from his own personal experience. I am anxious to afford some alleviation of your present distress. Now I've italicized a couple of these things, he didn't italicize them. Perfect relief is not possible, except with time. Now, that's a wonderful sentence to me. Perfect relief is not possible except with time. You cannot now realize that you will ever feel better, is this not so? Now that sounds a lot like what Erikson was doing to me, right? And yet it is a mistake, you are sure to be happy again to know this, which is certainly true will make you some less miserable now. I have experienced enough to know what I say and you need to only believe to feel better at once. The name of the book is called Lincoln's Melancholy, which is what they call depression in now these days. Lincoln's Melancholy by Joshua Shenk Wolf. So I'll give you a personal example. I was married and my wife got deathly ill, she was ill for about ten years, on the verge of dying many times and suffered so much, she wanted to die. And every once in a while, she get a little better and I would try to, you know, keep her going because I didn't want to lose her and you know, I psychotic optimist that I am, I believe she could get better, which I was right, I wanted her to know, she'd get better ultimately. But she didn't believe she would get better and she wanted to die all the time, for after a while. She was too much suffering, I can't do it. As I come on, hang on, you know I would do anything I could to talk her out of it. And so every once in a while she'd get better, we love movies, so we went to movies whenever we could and we went out to this movie called What Dreams May Come, some of you might have seen it. It's a really uplifting movie because everybody you come to love in this movie dies in this movie. Robin Williams plays a pediatric oncologist, a great guy, great with kids that have cancer and their families, his wife Annabella Sciorra is a great artist and she becomes curator of a museum and she -- you know, they have two great kids, they're fantastic with the Dalmatian dog that they all love. First the dog dies with cancer, okay, that's a little sad, right. Then the mother -- the kids ask the mother, you know, can you pick us up in school today, and she said the no, the nanny has to pick up because I got this board meeting at the art gallery. On the way home, the nanny and kids get in a car accident and die. So she doesn't want to live anymore, she just wants to -- she tries to kill herself. Now Robin Williams who is in love with her says like I've already lost the dog, lost the kids, I don't want to lose you, but ultimately she just keeps trying to kill herself and they have to hospitalize her. And they hospitalized her not in the hospitals we use the managed care run ones, but the ones with the green lounge, you know and the one to one staff patient ratio. But still she is miserable and she is not doing anything, and he comes out to visit her every day, trying to convince her to come back to life, and to come back to him and then she wasn't to blame for the kids' death, because she didn't pick them up that day, but she considers herself to blame, she can't go on. And so finally he goes out there and everyday he is trying to convince her and she stops looking at him, stops talking to him. And finally after a month, he goes out to talk to her because he realized this is what he's been doing wrong, he had been driving her away, and it's not working. And so we are in the movie theater and this is always something you should pay attention to as a spouse, this is just a marital tip. When someone's elbow is digging into your side during a movie and they say this is what happens in our relationship, pay attention to that, it's really important. So let me just show you this little scene in which the elbow is digging and then I'll tell you what I got from in it and what you might get from for couples. 

00:37:00
[music] 

00:37:10
 I need to talk to you and you don't have to respond. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
 This is a one-way ticket for me. My helping around here is not helping you, that's killing me. So today is kind of a D-day, D for decision I guess. A divorce. 

00:37:45
 That would be two Ds with us. 

00:37:50
BILL O'HANLON That would be two Ds, she says. She has spoken in a month. She looks at him for the first time in a month. 

00:37:55
 Stay corrected. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:05
 Look what happens when you don't say anything for a month. Cindy called. She said everything is waiting for you. 

00:38:15
 At the gallery. 

00:38:15
 Only artists and curators will meet with you and you are better. 

00:38:20
 Looks away, looks down. 

00:38:20
 And I told her it was the museum and one of those meetings, that kept you from driving that day. And if you went back, it'd mean, you weren't sorry and you weren't wrong, and you would be betraying your children. She said you were crazy and I said she was a soulless bitch! And I hung up on her! That didn't go very well. What's true in our minds is true, whether some people know it or not. That's when I realized I'm part of the problem. Not because I remind you, but because I couldn't join you, so I left you alone. 

00:39:20

00:39:25
 Thank you for the bouquet. 

00:39:30

BILL O'HANLON She comes out of hospital after this -- just for time to visit and we cut that out this, and very emotional scene, but sorry I gotta move on.

00:40:00
BILL O'HANLON So on the way home, my wife says to me you leave me alone in it. When I am suicidal, you leave me alone. She says you wouldn't that with one of your clients. I said, no I would. But I do not want to lose you, I have a stake in this. You know, with my clients I would say, you know, really it's their choice. I want them to live and I want to be able to help them to live, but really that's their choice, but I am not giving you that choice. You gotta stick around and she is like well, that's the thing. I feel alone, I feel more suicidal when I am alone. So you know, the next time she tells me she wants to die, the only thing that comes to my mind is psychotically optimistic things like we'll get you another test, we're gonna go to a new doctor and they gotta a new treatment, and I can't think of anything helpful to say that's not invalidating of her suffering and her desire to die, because I don't wanna agree with it, right. And so I just bite my tongue, because I can't think of anything to say and I just laid down and I just held her. She told me later that's the first time you didn't leave me alone in it. You were just with me. And within a couple of hours, she was talking about what she wanted to do next month. And I just say anything is like oh, now you wanna live, oh, nothing like that. I wasn't smart enough to do that. But I got it that sometimes you need to include the terrible stuff you do not want to include to get to the possibilities. So that leaves to the sixth method of acknowledgement and possibility and that's including opposites. So let me tell you a story. So I am working with this couple and this couple has lost a child as an adult a few year. In my presentation every day I tell this story, because I think it illustrates it really well. They lost their child to murder and there was this long murder investigation, it was quite messy, and they were just devastated and their friends gathered around them and supported them, but after a while, the friends -- it was too much for the friends, because you know all these gruesome details and they have -- they caught the murderer and they had to involve with the DA and there was some thought that he might get off even though he'd done this thing, it was real clear he'd done it and they kept a meeting with a DA and there just torn up and finally it comes to Christmas time and their friends like this is not a Christmas subject and they all kind of distanced from them, unnoticed by all the other friends and they spent Christmas alone with nothing to do, just sitting, there are Christmas tree, seeing they are missing their son for the first Christmas he is not there and no friends to talk to. And they become bound with one another, their each other's support, because nobody else didn't get how terrible this is and go through with them. And the friends all find out after Christmas that they all had pulled back and they feel even more guilty and they distanced even more. So they spend about a year and a half alone, just the two of them against the world, dealing with this terrible thing and finally they started to fight because they can't meet each other's every need and the strains are really -- you know, it's already hard enough to deal with the death of their son, but you can't meet everybody's need. You know, you have to have some outside support and they realize this and they come to couples therapy and that becomes really clear within a couple of sessions. They go, yeah, we've gotta get back out there, but here is the problem. Our friends, every time we talk to them, they tell us, we've gotta let this go, we've gotta get over it. And what they don't get is, you don't get over something like this. And so it really -- you know, we want our friends, we don't want their support, we don't want this kind of invalidation that they give us, you've gotta get over this. And so, they are in this dilemma. And finally, you know, they go out to -- during -- while we are in -- they are in couples therapy, the come back and they tell me they were out to a party couple of days before and they were standing around a circle of friends and someone said something in the circle that was hilarious and they both laughed and they caught each other's sight, because it was the first time they laughed in two years. And it's like is it okay for us to laugh, and they both sort of shared each other's reassurance like of course, our son wouldn't want us not to laugh and they just went and enjoyed the laugh. But on the way home, they talked they said, unfortunately, we were worried that our friends were started -- we think that means we're over it. We don't want them to start up with that stuff again, about how you've gotta get over, now, it's good you are over it because we just want to kill him when that happens. We just are so upset when that happens. And I said, what they don't get is that you'll never get over this and you're moving on. And they said, that's it. Say that again. And I said, you'll never get over this and you're moving on. They are like can you write that down, can you write that down, we're gonna tell them that. The next time they say anything about it, we'll say we're never gonna get over this, and we are moving on, that's how we're gonna respond. And so they wrote it down and now they had a response to their friends and they were so excited because that articulated something that's very hard logically to articulate. And again, you know, eastern religions, that's why I put the yin-yangs, they have this, it's like the yin is in the yang, the yang is in the yin, and it's both at the same time. You hate him and you love him. You can't stand this marriage and you can't leave. You can't forget that affair and you have to forget it, right. And so when some people have that as a conflict, what I want to do with this method is to put an and in between. It's like they've gotten stuck and two feelings or aspects of them or the couple is trying to go through a single door and they get stuck. And I am trying to make double door and say, it's okay, you can have both. That's sort of that no with the yes. Two, it's like you are hoping against hope. So Marion Woodman, the Jungian analyst calls this holding the tension of the opposites. But I don't really like the tension part, I just want the and part. This and this. This marriage is over and it's not over. And that is hard to get logically, because we have this Aristotelian logic, you know, this is either or. And it can't be both. You know, I learned in reciprocal inhibition when I learned psychologies of you can't love and hate at the same, yes you can. The heart, the soul, the human character is big enough to hold those contradictions to allow them to be two things at once. So here are some of the variations of that. This part of the method, you love him and you hate him. You want to leave and you want to stay. You'll never get over the affair and you are moving on, you can remember to forget and forget to remember. You can be vulnerable and protected. You can be as close as you need to be and as distant as you need to be. You feel alone when you are together. You can hold on to let go or to let him go. So this is kind of what Jungians call the shadow stuff and sometimes, we'd, you know, I was talking to the other day, Joni Mitchell has this song that I like a lot. It's about the breakup of relationships. She said and the line goes, so now I am returning to myself once again. And then there is a pause and she says, these things that you and I suppress. And what happens in couples is certain topics are taboo, certain aspects that you don't get to express and there are shameful aspects, there are unexpressed or suppressed aspects or neglected aspects. There are disowned aspects, devalued and sometimes you'd think I have to leave this relationship to get that stuff back to allow it. And so the -- the possibility is can you bring that stuff in and stay together, if it's a possibility right? So let me give you an example of this. We'll bring this to a close. So this is from The Story of Us, Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis. This couple have two kids they love dearly, but their relationship has really deteriorated. The kids go off to summer camp and they are deciding whether they're gonna stay together or break apart, and at the -- and she's become the ultra responsible one and he is become the fun, let the kids off the hook and don't get me consequences, playful, forget to cancel the papers when they gone vacation, forget to fill the washer fluid in the car, you know, he is the irresponsible one, she is the ultra responsible one. And they've gone to these shadow kind of cartoon images of each other. And they decide they're gonna break up. And they're finally gonna tell the kids when they pick them up at summer camp, and they're both readying to telling the kids, because they love the kids so much they know what is gonna do to kids. But they just try to make it several times over the summer, back to couple and they just can't do it. And so here they are in the way to the summer camp to pick up the kids.

 You're ready. 

00:51:50
 Yeah. 

00:51:55
 Yo! Hey, hey. What's up buddy? Good to see you. How you doing? 

00:52:00
 What's the matter mom? 

00:52:00
 She just missed you, that's all. 

00:52:05
 You both just grown so big. 

00:52:05
 Hey, look at you guys. I don't recognize you. Hey, wait a minute. Which one of you is Erin? 

00:52:15
 Check it out dad. 

00:52:15
 Wow. I guess we know what your highest today. Look at that, beast all-round camper, congratulations buddy. Look at that Katie. I guess this calls for a celebration. Come on kids, Riverdance. Come on, come on. I am the best all-round riverdancer. Come on Katie, kinda like little Latin loop-de-loop thing. Wow! Hey, now go with the big finish now. 

00:52:35
 Dad. 

00:52:35
 Come on. 

00:52:35
 Dad. 

00:52:35

00:52:35
 Come on dad, we're hungry. 

00:52:40
 Okay, all right. Okay, let's go home. 

00:52:50
[sil.] 

00:53:00
 I think we should go to Chow Fun's. 

00:53:05
 It is that they weren't going to Chow Fun's, as Tom never going to hit the bars. That's their favorite Chinese restaurant, they don't want to spoil it for their memory. 

00:53:10
 Chow Fun's? I thought we both agreed that we really couldn't talk at Chow Fun's. 

00:53:20
 I know. 

00:53:20
 What do you say? 

00:53:25
 I'm saying Chow Fun's. 

00:53:30
 Are you saying Chow Fun's because you can't face telling the kids, because it's that's why you are saying Chow Fun's, don't say Chow Fun's. 

00:53:35
 That's not why I'm saying Chow Fun's. I'm saying Chow Fun's because we are an us. There is a history here and histories don't happen overnight. You know in Mesopotamia or ancient Troy or somewhere back there -- they are cities built on top of other cities. But I don't want to build another city. I like this city. I know where we keep the Bactine and I what kind of mood you are in when you wake up by which eyebrow is higher and you always know that I am a little quiet in the morning and compensate accordingly. That's a dance you perfect over time. And it's hard, it's much harder than I thought it would be. But here is more good than bad and you don't just give up. And it's not for the sake of the children, but they are, god, great kids, aren't they? I mean god, and we made them, I mean think about that. There were no people there and there were people and then, then, grow and I won't be able to say to some stranger, Josh has your hands. Do you remember how Erin throw up a really good memorial. And I'll try to relax. Let's face it. Anybody is going to have traits that get on your nerves. I mean why shouldn't it be your annoying traits and I'm not at a beach, but I do have a good sense of direction. So at least I can find the beach, which is not a criticism of yours. It's just a strength of mine. God, you're a good friend and good friends are hard to find. Charlotte said that in Charlotte's Web and I love the way you read that to Erin and you take on the voice of Wilbur the pig with such commandment even when you are home tired. That speaks volumes about character and ultimately isn't that would it comes down to what a person is made of because that girl in the pit helmet is still in here. Bee-boo, Bee-boo. I didn't even know she existed until I met you. And I'm afraid if you leave, I may never see her again, even though I said at times you beat her out of me, isn't that the paradox? Haven't we hit the essential paradox, give and take, push and pull, the best of times, the worst of times. I think Dickens said it best, the Jack Sprat of it. He could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean. It doesn't really apply here, does it? I guess what I am trying to say is, I'm saying Chow Fun's because I love you. 

00:56:10
[music] 

00:56:15
 I love you too.

 Did you hear that kids? Now your mom wants go to Chow Fun's. Isn't that great? I love Chow Fun's. 

00:56:35
 Dad the egg rolls are good, but they are not that good. 

00:56:40
 No, no, the egg rolls are fantastic. They are warm, crispy, greasy as all hell, everything you want in egg rolls. 

00:56:45
 Exactly. Okay, High/Low, Erin your first. 

00:56:50
 My high for the summer is Austin Butler wrote me a 111 times. 

00:56:50
 How did you come up with High/Low. 

00:56:55
BILL O'HANLON Sorry. This for time for business, because I am pushing. Thank you. Thank you for being here. I will put the slides up on my website within the next few days and you can get a copy of those because I some people frantically trying to write or take pictures of them. Go to billohanlon.com, click free stuff, click slides, after there is a whole list of things come up. Give me about a week to post with my webmaster. So I hope what we've done here is reminded you of those two key things. If you stand too much on the acknowledgement side, people may not move on. If you stand too much on the challenge and change and new possibility sides, people may feel left behind, they don't feel you'd get them, that you've heard them, that you've acknowledged their pain and suffering. So both legs make a balanced approach to couples therapy. Thank you. 

00:57:40
 Bravo. 

00:57:40
BILL O'HANLON Thank you.
