Video Lecture 4: An Integrative Approach to Anxiety Role Play 3: A Focus on Existential Concerns 

00:00:00
Dr Clive Jones DipT, DipCouns, BEd, MEd, GradDipPsych, PhD(Psych), MAPS 

00:00:10
CLIVE JONES In, in this next video, case example, we're looking at anxiety again, but this time focusing here on this aspect of what may influence and encourage anxiety. We're looking at the existential and spiritual area. And, uh, in the context you'll, you'll hear in this first part of this case example the client sharing his story about existential concerns, uh, that have encouraged him to feel anxious. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN What brings you here today, Terry? 

00:00:45
TERRY Well I've just had my 57th birthday, uh, just a month ago. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:00:55
TERRY And, um, my dad died when he was 57 from complications around heart disease. And that's something that I also have as well. So I woke up couple nights ago going, "I'm the age that he died at." 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN Oh no. 

00:01:20
TERRY Exactly. And, um, it's scary. It, it feels like there's a death wish on me. I, I, I, I don't know whether that's what it is, but it feels like this. He made it to a certain age, I look a lot like him, I act a lot like him, I'm the oldest in the family, oldest of my four brothers, and, um, yeah, I'm scared that what's gonna happen to me. I'm, I'm reliving so many things that he's done and it's scary. It's really scary. So there's a real fear of dying right at this moment, or at this time because of the age that I've just turned. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN And 57 is that pivotal year for you, isn't it? 

00:02:10
TERRY Well, it is 'cuz it's the age that he, you know, he died and I don't know what to, I don't know how, I don't know how to just say "so it is" and get on with my own life. I feel like I'm stuck. I feel like I'm, the thought keep coming back, it keeps coming back. And it's seems to get, sometimes it's more intense than other times. So it's, it's, it's, it's challenging at the moment. And it's affecting other things that I'm doing. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Okay, so, for you, 57 and Dad's death has become a real anxiety. 

00:02:50
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN So let's worry about some of the things that could happen. Okay. So you're at the same age as Dad was, what are some of the things that could happen? Let's say them out loud. 

00:03:00
TERRY Well, I could die of a heart attack a, a, a, a heart attack, um, that, that he, like, he died from which, and I do have, I have had two heart attacks myself. So I'm aware of what that means and, and the, the pain and the, the, the challenge around that happening. So yes, so that's one possibility. 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN Okay, what else? 

00:03:30
TERRY Um, that's it. That's 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Okay. So it gets stuck there. 

00:03:35
TERRY Yeah, it's, it's, it's like the, it's that, okay, there's a, there's an age thing there and that's what could happen to me because that's what happened to him because I'm like him. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. And especially, you used the words "that could happen to me." What else could happen? 

00:03:45
TERRY Well, I could, it could not happen as well. Yeah, and, and, and I, I know that and I can tell myself that. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:55
TERRY Um, uh, I can tell myself that and I can understand it, but the other feeling seems to come, come back in almost immediately and get, it can become quite strong. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. So when, it sounds like when you said to yourself, "Okay, I could be fine, I could be fine," it just comes in like a flood and says, "No, but what if I'm not?" 

00:04:20
TERRY That's right, yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:20
TERRY Yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, that sounds really relevant. So what are you, what's happened for you when those thoughts come flooding back in? What are you thinking and feeling and what's happening? What questions are you asking yourself, even? 

00:04:35
TERRY Well, what happens to, you know, what happens to me when I am not here anymore? Physically not here anymore? It's, there's a whole, it's a whole range of thing-, some of them are interesting, some of them are actually are interesting, but it feels like I've still got things I wanted to do. There are still experiences that I want to experience, either new and or old, I guess I've already, some things I've already done in life but I'd like, I'd like to keep going and continue with. Um, so it's, I, I, I, I, you know, I find, sometimes can feel really hot and cold and sweaty and, um, it's just an anxious feeling of, what do I do, you know, yeah, what do I do with this? It, it, it's almost like it goes round and around and around, um, and then it goes away. It'll just go away 'cuz I get interested in something else. Could be anything, could be, you know, it could be anything at all, but something else will happen and it's gone and then something will come back to remind me of it again. 

00:05:45
CLIVE JONES In the second section of, uh, this case example on existential concerns that would be encouraging anxiety, uh, the, the story unfolds more and the client unravels the meaning and significance of particular areas of the story that are encouraging anxiety for him. You notice, uh, you will notice that, uh, the counselor is taking a, a, a non-directive approach to allow the client to really, uh, voice, uh, uh, uh, for the first time really, uh, those concerns that are causing him anxiety. And so it's quite a significant process in this next section where the client is moving from an internal dialogue and is actually sharing very specifically with someone else. This is an important part of being able to, first of all, face clearly, and then work though, existential concerns that are encouraging anxiety. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN So it seems like today, Terry, you're really looking for answers. 

00:06:55
TERRY Yes, to a certain, to some degree. I don't know whether it's an answer or it's something else that I can't actually put my finger on. I can't actually say, yes, this is what I'm looking for, this is what I want. Although, having said that, I can say, I'd like to turn 58. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:15
TERRY Yeah. I, I'd like to move on from this age because of the, of the coincidence with my dad and Dad's age when he died and my age now. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. So you'd like to successfully turn 58. 

00:07:30
TERRY Yes. I'd like to still, well, I'd like to be alive. Yeah, I'd like to turn 58. Yeah. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:35
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN What does 58 represent? 

00:07:40
TERRY Um, in my mind it feels like this, I'm less likely to die. Or I'm less likely to die, I don't know, the same way as my dad. It's, it's sort of like this, this, this year is, it's, it's very much focused on him and how he was and what I remember of him and the fact of, you know, I can see the last time I saw him before he died and, yeah. It's just all come up. And I've been, you know, in a sense, part of me has been dreading this year for a long, for a number of years. Um, and others that in my family remind me of the fact that, not, not in a, not in a morbid way, but, oh, you know, you're a, you're the, you know, oh, you're the age of, my brothers will say it in conversation from time to, or have said it from time to time. So I am, yeah, I'd like to get to 58 so that it doesn't happen. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. And even then your brothers can say, well, you outlived Dad. 

00:08:45
TERRY Well, that's true, yes. They could do that, but that seems okay. It's like, the "outlived" is better than saying, well, this is the same year as when he died. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN What a tragedy. 

00:09:00
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. It would be. 

00:09:00
TERRY Yeah. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN And what's happening for you thinking about Dad and in ways that you probably never thought of Dad before? 

00:09:10
TERRY What's happening for me? Um, lots of, uh, it's, it's to do with memories and, uh, various ways we interacted which sometimes was okay and sometimes wasn't. Um, but just memories of him. Uh, yeah, and how he interacted with me and, and, and mainly, not, not, not so much any other way at all. Just our interactions. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN And it sounds like they've come really close to the surface for you now. 

00:09:50
TERRY Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's because they ended there. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN They do. 

00:09:55
TERRY You know, when I was a lot younger than I am now and he was 57, so there's, there's, there's nothing more to build on. And there are times I'd like to be able to talk to him. Having now reached a certain, the age that, that, that, that he had, I realized the wisdom that he had that I never acknowledged before. So in a way there is a, I wanted to say, and I, I just, I, I do talk, I talk to him in my head and say, you know, I now appreciate some of the things you said, whereas when I was the 20, or the teenager or 20-year-old or 30-year-old I couldn't see it. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN So tell me about a situation now that you would like to talk to Dad about. 

00:10:40
TERRY Well, it was some of thing, some of the, when I was a teenager, particularly, and I guess, you know, there's the rebellious, that's the rebellious side of me, no matter what he said, I would've thought, well, you know, I'm not gonna do that no matter what. But some of the things, some of the decisions he made, um, I, I guess now, I can sense now my mum particularly didn't, she didn't agree with them. Um, but she was the sort of person that didn't say, at least, not, not out in front of all the family, that, uh, "I don't like that idea," or "Can we talk about this?" or "Can we talk about as a family?" Um, it, it, it could be simple things, like where we go on holidays, for example, or when we go on holidays. Dad decided that the only time we have holidays was at a certain time of the year around Christmas and New Year. And while that might not seem strange, it was like he decided rather than when we were all old enough to be able to decide where we'd like to go, no one else was considered. So he, he was a very much a, at least he presented himself to be very much a, a factual person rather than allowing himself to talk about things emotionally. And, and, and, and the reasons why, you know, the feelings behind thinking. Never ever, ever heard him talk about feelings about things. But I'm sure he had, well, I know he had them, but we never heard them. I never heard them. So there are things, that's, that's an example, and, and, you know, it was interactions with me and some of the things, some of the things that he said, no, this is how it's gonna be done, whether it was my education and so forth. I, I, I just, I'm just curious, I'd like to find out, well, what, what was happening for you at the time? You know, why did you think that? Rather than not, not what did you think that that was appropriate or no, not, not the factual reasons but the emotional reasons. You know, what was behind it? What did you think might be good for me or what did you, why did you think that might be the best? Rather than just hearing what he decided was the best and that was it, end of story. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN It sounds like you knew Dad the father, but not Dad the man. 

00:12:55
TERRY Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he had a certain position and that's where he pretty much stayed. Yeah. That's, yeah, that's where he stayed. It's, I, I think, um, you asked me before, you said before about having a certain wisdom, being able to (inaudible ) and, and, and be honest with each other and be able to say, well, you know, he, he, he is, you know, I know you didn't, you weren't aware of this, this, my father would say this, "You weren't aware of this then, son, but." 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:30
TERRY Okay, so what's the but? Or not but, or and. What's the and, you know? To be able to talk about it just so that I can understand more of his person. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN To fill in the picture more. 

00:13:40
TERRY Yeah, that's right. 'cuz I know who he was, I know physically who he was, but I don't really know anything else apart from, or very little apart from that. My mum's filled in some of the bits and pieces for me, but again, that's not first person, that's coming though someone else's eyes. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Exactly. And through Mum's experiences of Dad rather than who your dad was to you. 

00:14:00
TERRY That's right. Exactly. It's a totally different relationship. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN And now especially when, when you're Dad's age and you would relate to Dad as a person with emotions and feelings that, as you said, a teenager, you didn't have that understanding. So Dad and you might actually be friends now. 

00:14:20
TERRY Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm sure we would be. I'm sure we would be, but never got that chance. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. And that'd be a great place to be. 

00:14:25
TERRY It would. 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. So what are you doing with all of this that's happening inside of you? 

00:14:35
TERRY Um, I talk about it with my wife sometimes. Her, her dad's still alive and I, I encourage her to keep the contact, um, and she does and I. So I don't have a contact with, I don't have contact with him, there's, we talk but it's very superficial, and that's fine. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:00
TERRY Um, uh, I think a lot, no, remind myself not to be, to be, to, to, to be open to share that wisdom, or if someone asked me why I do, you know, someone, someone, one of my um, I, I now relate more, more closely than ever to my nephews and nieces. Um, they range from 22 of age downwards to about 10 or 11. And when I go to Sydney, um, I know they enjoy talking with, uh, with Uncle Terry. Um, and I've had some marvelous conversations with them, not telling them, but just listening and, and they will ask me, they're, they're very open, well, "What, why, why would you think, why did you say that?" "Why did you, what did you think that might be a possible thing for me to think about?" And I will tell you why and explain perhaps from my own life why I think that's so. Um, so I guess that's how I'm using it. I'm sort of imagining myself in that 57-year-old father, wise person, and while I'm not talking to my sons or daughters because I don't have any, um, but talking to close relatives that I'm happy to talk with. Not forcing them to, but I usually end up, you know, we have a family do and I end up talking with them and that's great. It's really good. So there's a sharing of wisdom and, and allowing them to see me being emotional about something if something really moves me. Seeing, uh, see me, let them see me cry or be frustrated or angry. 

00:16:45
[sil.] 

00:16:50
CLIVE JONES The last section of this, uh, case example on existential elements of anxiety will be looking at um, a summarizing of the path taken so far. Often with existential concerns the client, uh, can dialogue in a way that's very philosophical and can move around a lot of different places, but just because there's larger and significant things being talked about in a broad range of different areas, uh, it doesn't mean they're not significant and they are certainly the points of concern that encourage their anxiety. And so when the, the story can have so many, uh, thoroughfares to move through it's important that the counselor does spend a bit of their time in summarizing and clarifying what those existential concerns are to bring it back to the connection that it has with the anxiety. And so this last section is starting to do that as an example of the ongoing process of working with existential concerns. 

00:17:55
[sil.] 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN Terry, in this session we've really talked a lot about your dad, of course, and Dad's death at 57 and the anxiety and the many issues that the anxiety has brought up for you and the challenges of now wanting to talk to Dad at 57, talking to your dad who was 57. That essence just seems so palatable that there is so much that you still want to talk to Dad about. Where do you and Dad talk? 

00:18:30
TERRY Um, when I go walking. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:18:35
TERRY Yeah. I do a lot of walking and I live near there. I live near the waterside and, uh, it's my exercise, but it's when I do lots of, lots and lots of um, what about this, what about that, and what about the time when, particularly this year 'cuz, you know, that's this whole feeling of unease around being 57. And I guess I wanna ask him, or I ask him things like, so what's it like, what was it like for you to be 57? Did you know that you were going to die? 'cuz I think he did. I think he knew he was, I think he knew he was really unwell. But he didn't say anything. That's, that's my intuition, but, but I've heard that from other members of the family as well, that they felt that Dad knew and he wouldn't say anything. And I want to know what it is 'cuz I guess I wanna know whether it applies to me as well. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:19:35
TERRY It's that whole 57 um, yeah, it's, it's. I'm fascinated and I'm scared at the same time. I wanna know what it's, you know, what was happening for him and I'm scared in case it happens to me. 

00:20:00
UNKNOWN And it seems in so many ways you've constant-, you've consciously made yourself different than Dad because before when you said when you said Dad was a very, he didn't emotionally talk about himself, but you've become the opposite in that everybody can talk to Uncle Terry and that even in a situation like this, there's still that open and honesty where Dad, maybe he did know he was ill but kept it to himself. And maybe your mum, you know, or maybe Dad being who Dad seems to have been, he kept it away from Mum so she didn't worry. 

00:20:35
TERRY Yeah, I think that's right. I think that's what, I think that's what probably happened. And um, I try to know why. Why couldn't he say what he, what, what was going on in his mind? And I don't, I ask the questions, but I don't, well, I hear responses. 

00:21:00

00:21:00
Video Lecture 4: An Integrative Approach to Anxiety Role Play 4: A Focus on Intrapersonal Conflict 

00:21:15
CLIVE JONES The, the next case today that we're going to be looking at is focusing anxiety from the intrapersonal perspective or anxi-, another term for intrapersonal is intrapsychic. And again, as talked about in previous videos, the intrapersonal or the intrapsychic focuses very specifically on those internal issues and conflicts that a person might have within themselves. And so as you'll see here, uh, the issues that are causing anxiety for this client is focusing very specifically on, uh, the stuff that's going on inside them, uh, what's going on within them, what are they wrestling with, and issues that they're facing within themselves very specifically. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Hello, Bruno, how are you today? 

00:22:05
BRUNO Good, how are you? 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Good, good, good. Um, you phoned so I was thinking give me a bit of the story, let's, let's start at the beginning and see where it takes us. 

00:22:15
BRUNO Yeah. I really don't know what's happening. Uh, what I found was that, uh, I've been, I haven't been feeling very comfortable with work at times. So um, basically, everything would be fine one moment and then the other moment I, I feel like being very stressed. And, uh, pretty much like a constant being sitting down in that room anymore. And, uh, started to go on for quite a while now and I kinda was waiting to set back, but it didn't and it started to affect my progress in work. So I got a referral, I keep on calling, trying to see what's happening. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN And you're here. So when you're at work, this is, this is when you get these feelings? 

00:23:05
BRUNO Well, mainly, yeah. That's, that's where, well, when I'm not at work I'm often, you know, relaxing with friends and I don't really get worried, but I think the pressure really gets on at work. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Bruno, do you think this is affecting your work performance, I mean, your concentration, that sort of thing at work? 

00:23:25
BRUNO Yeah, that's why I decided to see you. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Right. Now so it's quite intense. 

00:23:30
BRUNO Yeah. 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Okay. What, what do you feel like, when the, when you, when this comes on, what, what is it that you're feeling? 

00:23:40
BRUNO I can't really explain it. It's like it comes from within. It's, it's. I can't concentrate at all, I feel like, agitated, um, I might even say nervous, you know, like yeah. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN Feel a bit crunched up or? 

00:24:00
BRUNO Exactly. Yes. And, uh, just like the blood's going through my head at light speed. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN S-, sounds, sounds to me like it might be anxiety. Would you call it? Yeah? 

00:24:15
BRUNO Yes, exactly, yeah. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Exactly. So there's something impacting you that's, makes you really almost fearful? 

00:24:20
BRUNO Yes. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:24:20
BRUNO Yeah. I can't quite put my finger on why it is comes at different times, but yeah. 

00:24:30
UNKNOWN So at, at this point there's something that's, that's triggering, triggering these feelings of anxiety, uh, with fear in there. 

00:24:40
BRUNO It seems like it comes out of nowhere, but yeah, something is. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN What do you do? What do you do when you get these feelings? 

00:24:45
BRUNO Well, usually I just get up and have a walk outside and, uh, but I be having five-minute walks every two hours anymore. So yeah. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Bruno, does it only happen when you're at your desk? Does it happen, like, anywhere else outside of work? Let's look at that for a start. 

00:25:10
BRUNO I can't remember anytime happening outside of work. It mainly happens when I'm at work, yeah. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN And is it just when you're at your desk or at your workstation or it happens everywhere in the work environment? 

00:25:20
BRUNO Mainly when I'm at my desk. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN I know this probably sounds as if I'm harping on, on the, on the one point, but, Bruno, is it like a um, I'm trying to find a connection here so it, uh, to introduce like, what would trigger this. So is like if, if somebody comes up to talk to you or? 

00:25:45
BRUNO I can give you an example of the last time it happened. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN Oh. Let's hear it. 

00:25:45
BRUNO Um, I'm a programmer. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:25:50
BRUNO And, uh, what happens is I have three different bosses. And uh... 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN That would cause anxiety. 

00:25:55
BRUNO Oh, it does! But that's not the problem. The problem is the lady that tests all my applications, you know, she's the lady that tests everything before a program actually get, goes out. Now, that's a job that needs to be done, but it's being done by someone that has absolutely no idea what they are doing. So last week I, I really lost it 'cuz, uh, she came over to my desk and tell me things that weren't working and she was screaming, not screaming, but she, you know, like, really agitated about these things. When, maybe it was because she didn't know how to use it! So here I was, listening to that for half an hour when all that she is doing is reporting my bosses that something that she couldn't do properly and blaming it onto me. And I was on up as soon as she walked out, I felt like I could not take anymore. If I didn't stand up and went outside for a walk, I don't know what would have happened. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN Bruno, do you think it might be a bit more than, than the anxiety and the fear? Do you think it could be a bit of anger there too? 

00:27:20
BRUNO Sounds like it! Yeah, a bit of, uh, actually saying it, it does. I would not have phrased it that way before, but yeah. 

00:27:35
CLIVE JONES As you can see in that first section, uh, the client was encouraged to explore the internal, uh, conflicts or issues that were going on. And slowly but surely there was a, a revealing of issues that the client was having within themselves that was encouraging anxiety. In this next section of the role play, you'll be seeing, uh, greater clarity coming out in regard to the intrapersonal, almost intrapsychic issues that are causing the distress and the anxiety in the client. And you'll find quite interestingly that, that there's a, a conflict causing the anxiety is really a concern and a worry over anger and feelings of anger and how to control anger. And so this is about within the individual, uh, even though it does involve relationships with others as the story unfolds and you're hearing that, ultimately, the real anxiety is coming from, uh, concerns and issues about anger within self. And, and so this next section reveals that intrapsychic or intrapersonal conflict a little bit more. 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN So Bruno, we, we think we might be dealing with anger now? Do you think? 

00:28:55
BRUNO It does ring a bell, yeah. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN It does, yeah. So Bruno, you mentioned about when this lady comes over to speak with you and, you know, you're concerned about some of the, um, what she's examining your work and she doesn't seem to have the, the IT understanding that you have. Um, you know, are you angry at this person, are you angry at this lady? 

00:29:20
BRUNO Not, not really. Like, the way I see her is like, she's, she's totally replaceable, you know? It's not like, uh, I feared her in any way or, it's just that, mainly it's the fact that when she's around I can't control myself. Well, I mean, not, if you know what I mean? 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:29:50
BRUNO I start getting angry without even noticing it and what I feel is that then I'm not in complete control of my body or myself or. So when I'm talking, I might start, you know? Jittering, so. That's when I feel worst about, yeah. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN So, so that you sort of (inaudible ) towards this person, but there's some anger there, so what, what is it, what is causing the anger? Very often we're told that anger is also associated with fear. Is there something, is there a fear there that's associated with this anger? 

00:30:40
BRUNO Well, there is a fear. It's more the fear of losing the (inaudible ). 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Would you, would you be afraid, angry, whatever at this moment of what you might do? Maybe fearful of yourself? 

00:30:55
BRUNO Well, I don't know what I could do, but the possibilities are not good. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:31:00
BRUNO That would be not, and so it happens in a week's time we have a meeting, her and my three bosses, and I'm terrified of what, what I could do. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Excellent. So you're terrified of what you might do in that situation. 

00:31:15
BRUNO Exactly. I need help before that meeting. 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN I think we've come a long way just recently. So, Bruno, when, when you have this, this fear or this anger, um, and you're fearful of what you might do, you're feeling fearful of losing it, what, what actions would you be, would you be fearful of, of doing? 

00:31:50
BRUNO Oh, just, I couldn't stop, just standing and shouting towards her or sometimes I know I would throw a monitor at her face, but, uh, hopefully it wouldn't get that far. But I couldn't, I would be lying if I said that, that, that this isn't there, that, that I'm willing to do such a thing. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Bruno, can I ask, the way, the, this is quite intense for you, isn't it? So when you have these intense feelings, how do you, how do you cope with it, how do you suppress it, how do you not? 

00:32:25
BRUNO Well, so far it hasn't come to the point where I have to actually go to which won't be the case. Next time we'll be locked in a room practically and I'll be, have to just sit there and that's why I'm worried. But so far I've been able to rush out of it and go, go away before I do something stupid. But I'm afraid that it keeps getting worse and worse and worse and it'll come to where I won't, I won't be able to do that. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I can understand that. When you have these feelings you say you want to get out and rush away. 

00:33:00
BRUNO Yeah. 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN What are you thinking as you're rushing away? Can you? 

00:33:05
BRUNO You have to understand that I'm not rationalizing this. Uh, it's just trying to work the angry, the anger out. So that's basically what I'm going, but it's sort of like I'm talking to myself. It's just like, trying to soothe myself. 

00:33:30
CLIVE JONES Okay, now after watching that second part of this role play, you can see that the, that the client is terrified of his anger and so the anxiety is coming from a fear of himself, a fear that's coming from within himself, about himself, and in regard to his anger, in regard to how he can, um, emotionally regulate the anger that he's feeling. And so you can see how the client has moved from just having what you would say panic attacks and, and bouts of anxiety at work and not knowing why or where they're coming from and then you can see how though a subtle, not directly guided approach, the, the counselor has, has encouraged the client to review and reassess what that actually means, that anxiety. And you've seen that it's moving into the intrapersonal or the intrapsychic where the client is, is feeling terrified of his own anger. Now to show a secondary factor in regard to that is the interpersonal as well. Okay, so there is an intrapersonal or intrapsychic conflict within the individual and a secondary factor is the interpersonal with the client's boss as well. And so, uh, a reassessment of how to approach and deal with the issues that the client faces with the boss, that is certainly something that would move on to down the track in terms of the counseling process. But you can see that there's a focus here very specifically on the intrapersonal. And so now this next section is still staying on the intrapersonal for now and for sure, as the counseling process progresses through the weeks, then it would shift to the interpersonal and looking at different ways of communicating and dealing, um, with the situation with the boss. But for now it's focusing on the intrapersonal and in this instance you'll see now the counselor is starting to have the client reassess their perspective on anger and reassess, um, their own sense of ability in being able to deal and cope with their anger in an effective way. And so you can see that there's a, a reframing and a, and a, and a reassessment process going on to resolve the intrapersonal conflict. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN So, Bruno, as you said, as you're rushing out, you're, you're, you're not thinking, you're not, you're being irrational. 

00:36:00
BRUNO Sort of. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Can, can, can I press a little further and just, just ask so, even when you get outside, when you, when you take that deep breath, what, do you know, do you know what you're thinking then? Is it a sense of relief, is it? 

00:36:15
BRUNO Well, I try to control myself. And I can control, that I, it is okay for me to come back, do my work. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN So Bruno, when you leave that area, when you leave the room, what, what is it that causes you to leave? Is it, is it, um, is it that, like you said, a, a, a fear of hurting this person or saying something or throwing something? Um, is it that fear of not knowing what to do through yourself? 

00:36:50
BRUNO Yeah, the, the anger gets to a point and I think like I'm going to hit this person or if there is a (inaudible ) I'm going to, you know? And I don't wanna do that, obviously, so I think it's the best thing I could do is. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN And, and you haven't hit her, you haven't hurt her, you haven't hurt anyone. But no. 

00:37:15
BRUNO I wouldn't think I would hurt a fly, but then again, a fly doesn't make me that angry! 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN That's certainly a very good point. Um, so Bruno, considering that you haven't hurt this person, you haven't hurt anyone in the past, you said you wouldn't hurt a fly, what is it that's, you're concerned about that makes you feel you might do something next time? When you said you're not a violent person? 

00:37:45
BRUNO I don't know, really. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Is it, is it a fear of maybe having these bad thoughts of hurting someone even though you've not done the actions to hurt someone? 

00:38:00
BRUNO Yeah, I don't think I could ever actually do that, no. No. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Is it maybe that recognition that these are negative thoughts that you would to hurt this person or would certainly enjoy hurting this person? 

00:38:15
BRUNO Yeah, I wouldn't. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Well, of course you wouldn't. You said you wouldn't. But Bruno, it's perfectly natural for us all at times to want to hit someone or, 

00:38:30
BRUNO That's not right, is it? 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, it is. It's perfectly normal to. I mean, Lord, there are times when I would like to, to hit someone. But I don't and that's the difference. And that's the difference with you. 

00:38:40
BRUNO And how can I know that I won't? 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Well, you haven't done it yet, have you? 

00:38:45
BRUNO No. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN And you have strategies in place which you already know where you remove yourself from the situation. So it maybe it's that fear of, not so much the anger, uh, when you get angry that, that, that fear of what, you know, um, of the situation. Maybe it's more a fear of what you think you might do. And you know you're not going to do anything except the right thing and remove yourself. 

00:39:20
BRUNO It makes a good point. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN It's perfectly normal to be.

Video Lecture 4: An Integrative Approach to Anxiety Final Summary on the Video Series: An Integrative View on Anxiety 

00:39:45
CLIVE JONES Well, the case examples that you have gone through and, and looked at have been, uh, picked out to represent some areas of this integrated model of personality. Just to clarify, uh, in regard to any issues that represents in counseling but specifically what we've been talking about with anxiety, it is inappropriate to uh, box and, and, and manualize a treatment for anxiety or any other issue, for that, matter. Uh, what we're wanting to demonstrate through these, uh, videos is that when dealing with clients, we have to be aware of the various range of issues that can influence, uh, thoughts, feelings, or cognitions and emotions and behaviors. There are internal factors that, that push out on those things and there are external factors that are pushing in on those things as well. And so as counselors we need to be aware of the various places that clients come from and where, where they're at in terms of their anxiety. And as a result of that, it means that we can't just grab onto one surefire method of treating anxiety. We have to deal with it in the context of where the anxiety is coming from. Is it to do with existential concerns, intrapersonal relationships? Is it predominantly concerns about cognitions or physical symptoms? Uh, it's very important that, um, the client and what the client is sharing and communicating plays a significant part in how the cli-, how the counselor ends up working with the client. So remember, an integrated approach is really important. We will keep in mind the broader concept of those influences on the way we might think, feel, and behave.
