The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Good afternoon everybody. Welcome. Thanks so much for coming to this demonstration hour. I really appreciate it that. Ah, I was gonna do a clinical demonstration of hypnosis but since I have you here I thought I'd like to talk to you about the merits of Amway products. Ah... 

00:00:20
JENNA No! 

00:00:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So, why hypnosis? And I don't know of any modality that has had more ups and downs in terms of, ah, acceptability than hypnosis. Any one domain that has more mythology and misconception associated with it than hypnosis. And from a clinical perspective, to me, the most obvious things about the merits of hypnosis are, are the big factors. People learn more easily when they're focused. People learn more easily when they're relaxed and it isn't even necessarily relaxation has to be a part of the deal. That's not really the defining characteristic of hypnosis but when people get absorbed in experience. It's so much richer, so much more multidimensional. And of course, with a therapeutic points of view, the things that we talked about, we want the person to be able to not just know and understand but also to be able to experience in, in whatever way subjectively is, is the most meaningful to them So anytime that I'm doing a demonstration of hypnosis as I'm about to do, I'm really striving to create a context where this person can do some self explorations, self discovery, some connection to truly the best parts of themselves. I'll say more about that in just a moment but let me divers for just a second and say when I come into these demonstration hours and many of you have seen them in the past, you know that I don't have someone specific that I begin with. It's always a random kind of thing to begin with. So I would like to continue that and make it a fair thing in case there are multiple people who want to be a volunteer for this process. So if, in fact, you would like to be a volunteer let me just give you a couple of, ah, self selection criteria. First of all, obviously it has to be something you feel comfortable talking about in front of the group. Ah, it is being recorded and the recording is gonna be following you around for a while. So ah, you know, that, that's important. Secondly, with help if the problem that you're presenting to me is a relatively circumscribed one. Now is not the time to present to me a personality disorder or the fact that you like that you have a more than casual interest in farm animals. Uhm, third, the foundation's criterion is that you not have been a volunteer before at any of the meeting so that we have the opportunity who haven't had that experience yet and we give them a chance. I have that, that experience. And so, if you are interested in volunteering, you wanna throw your hat in the ring. Actually, what I would like you to do is just write your name on a small slip of paper and hand it to Jenna(ph) the, ah, volunteer here and then we'll do, ah, a lottery. It just seems the fairest way to do that. So, ah, everybody ha-- who, who is interested has an equal chance of participating. So while we're doing that volunteer thing, the other comments that I wanna make about hypnosis all relate to the fact that what we're working with ultimately is the quality of people's attention. You know, in the days passed people used to use more esoteric terminology like trance states and s-some pretty, ah, unusual portrayals of what would happen. Modern cognitive neuroscience has been focused entirely on attentional issues and different qualities of attention. And it's one of those things that whenever somebody's beginning to session like this, you don't really know what this person's going to be capable of experiencing. This is one of the interesting phenomenon in the field of hypnosis. It is a given that people differ in their capacities. Nobody argues that point and people have been trying to assess what hypnotic responsiveness is about literally for the last hundred years under the most stringent of scientific conditions. And still it's somewhat mysterious. If we ask the question what determines hypnotic responsiveness, it's really hard to know. It hasn't been correlated with intelligence, hasn't been correlated with age or gender or socioeconomic status or a-any of the big five personality variables. Uhm, and what's particularly interesting to me is that while nobody would argue that people differ in their capacities, ah, where the discussions get really interesting is in terms of what that means and there you have the different viewpoints about what this whole phenomenon is. So as I begin session, for me it really is an exploration and that's the, the attitude I approach this with. So if we have some names of people, now's the time to do the, ah, pulling this out. In the middle that you reach up about where you can't see it. So if you don't get picked, you can blame Jenna(ph). 

00:06:40
JENNA An Astrid Ogre(ph). 

00:06:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Astrid(ph). Okay, come on up Astrid(ph). Uhm, she needs to sign her release and Astrid(ph), if you wouldn't mind removing your name badge otherwise it will be reflecting the lights and... 

00:07:00
[sil.] 

00:07:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM All right. So while they're doing that now would be a good time to remind you if you would mind shutting off your cellphones. It would be nice to do a session like this without having external interruptions. 

00:07:20
[sil.] 

00:07:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM She has no idea that while she's signing that, underneath is a form that says she's taking over my car payments, ah, this is... ssshh. Don't tell her. 

00:08:00
[sil.] 

00:08:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM We're good. Hi Astrid(ph), how are you. 

00:08:15
ASTRID Fine. 

00:08:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Good. Have a seat. Thanks so much for volunteering to do this. Appreciate that. Honey, move it down just a little bit closer your mouth, there you go. Let's do a test on the mike. Say something. 

00:08:40
ASTRID Hello. 

00:08:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Great. Okay, hello. What would you like help with? 

00:08:45
ASTRID Uhm, I have trouble, kind of trusting other people to be there for me, tend to be really independent, uhm, have a hard time asking for help even from family members. 

00:09:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM A hard time trusting that people will be there for you. 

00:09:05
ASTRID Correct. 

00:09:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM How do you know who should be trusted to be there for you? 

00:09:10
ASTRID well, I think, like my husband I should trust. Ah, my adult children. It's kinda my siblings and, and even my work colleagues. 

00:09:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, now you've told me who you think you should trust. The question I asked was how do you know who you should trust. 

00:09:35
ASTRID I think because I trust them or I think they trust me, that it's reciprocal. 

00:09:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM If somebody trusts you that means you're trustworthy? 

00:09:45
ASTRID It doesn't make sense does it? I, I guess I don't have a good answer. I don't know. 

00:09:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. So, even as you hear yourself say that, what occurs to you? 

00:10:00
ASTRID It's, ah, probably intellectual, kind of. Thinking about it versus maybe not, not feeling the, the trust or understanding that. 

00:10:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Do you trust yourself? 

00:10:20
ASTRID Yes. 

00:10:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM How do you know you can trust yourself? 

00:10:25
ASTRID Cuz I feel like I'll, I'll be there for me. 

00:10:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM How do you know that? 

00:10:30
ASTRID More of as-- kind of a sense of it. 

00:10:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, so if I'm introducing you to someone - 

00:10:40
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:10:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - how do you evaluate this person, how do you assess the quality of trustworthiness this person has? 

00:10:50
ASTRID I think it's more the-- again the sense, maybe the congruency between what I feel and, and what they say. 

00:11:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Congruency between what you feel and what they say. 

00:11:05
ASTRID Right. 

00:11:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now, I don't really intend to pry much but is it something that-- just generally yes or no experiences that you've had of being let down apparently - 

00:11:20
ASTRID Yes. 

00:11:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - by people who were in a position to live up to some responsibility - 

00:11:25
ASTRID Yes. 

00:11:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - but they didn't. 

00:11:30
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:11:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And what did you conclude from that? 

00:11:35
ASTRID Ah, I think I-- that lots of people are not trustworthy. I think I generalized from, ah, specific to, ah, kind of, ah, lots of people. 

00:11:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Mm-hmm. And of course there are a lot of people who can't be trusted. 

00:11:50
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:11:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And there are some who can. Which is why what I asked you how do you know who you can trust. 

00:12:00
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:12:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Your answer basically was not sure. 

00:12:05
ASTRID Mm-hmm.. 

00:12:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Have you had much experience with hypnosis? 

00:12:10
ASTRID No. 

00:12:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Any experience at all? 

00:12:15
ASTRID I, I did some training, like, many, many years ago but I, I haven't utilized it much in practice or even with myself. 

00:12:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You've had the experience of getting absorbed in the experience in that training or not so much? 

00:12:35
ASTRID Not so much, no. 

00:12:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Cuz the experience wasn't there, because you just didn't respond to it. 

00:12:40
ASTRID Mmm, I didn't take the time. 

00:12:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You didn't take the time for it. All right. Is there anything specific that you wanna tell me about or do you have an idea already that I got an idea what's going on. 

00:13:00
ASTRID Right, right now maybe. 

00:13:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Yeah. Anything else you need to tell me in other words. Okay. Cuz here's what I'd like to be able to do. Obviously this is gonna be a hypnosis session. 

00:13:15
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:13:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And what I'd like to do is use this experience as a way of orienting you to a different quality of thinking about this whole issue and I'll be interested as we go along to able to check in with-- see what you're experiencing if that's all right with it. 

00:13:35
ASTRID Sure. 

00:13:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, all right. Let's begin. Arrange yourself in whatever position's comfortable for you and begin by taking in a few deep relaxing breaths. Let your eyes close whenever you're ready so that you can start to build an internal focus for a while. Because over the course of the next few minutes I'm gonna be talking about a lot of different ideas, possibilities, experiences. And I thought it was very reassuring, very reassuring Astrid(ph). To hear you say that you could trust yourself. Because ultimately that is the skill that I'm going to be building on. I don't know if other people really know just what you mean when you say you trust yourself. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Does it mean you trust yourself to be comfortable? Does it mean you trust yourself to do what you said you're going to do? Does it mean you know yourself well enough to know which parts of yourself, which dimensions of your experience. You can reach inside and connect it to in ways that provide you comfort. You know as well as I do, the world is filled with a diverse range of opportunities. Different qualities of people, places, things. 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And the fact that you've come to know yourself well enough to trust yourself. Doesn't really matter what I say unless it fits and enhances experience in some way. Doesn't really matter how other people see the issue and over the years you've learned what makes you reliable in your responses. Enough to be able to have that sense, a profound sense that you can reach inside and find the relevant part... 

00:18:40
[sil.] 

00:18:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...Right when you need it. But isn't it curious even at a meeting like this one Astrid(ph)? Where you're exposed to lots of really interesting and experienced people and how different their views are. How diametrically opposite. They can be in approaches... 

00:19:30
[sil.] 

00:19:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...And you discover that other people don't think the way you think, don't feel the way that you feel, don't value what you value. And likewise there are things that are so important to them that you don't really care much about. The things that represent their deeply held values and beliefs and it's one of the things I've learned through years of traveling different cultures, how different people can be about the most basic things like what the proper use of money is or what the best use of time is. Even what people define as food. Things they're willing to put in their mouth, I would even think about eating. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And while you spent so much time exploring yourself, learn about yourself. Whether a lot of people go traveling in other countries or in other cities and they don't really observe what's there. It's curious that you can be so filled with opportunities to notice what's unique, what's different and how often people notice just what reminds them of home. Every person you meet, Astrid(ph), is of foreign culture. Each place you go there will always be similarities. They have roads, they have buildings but there will always be differences and what matters subtle differences and not so subtle differences. 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM But I wonder what you think about those people who becomes so critical because these people are eating wrong, they're dressing wrong, they're just not doing it the way it should be done and... 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...What it-- interesting realization. I remember working with a couple once and she said to him, "You don't do what I want you to do." And he said, "Tell me what you want me to do." And she said, "After all these years together, why don't you know what I want you to do?" And every time that they've had that discussion 1000 times the discussion ended right there. So you can imagine her surprise when I asked her they question, "Why after all these years don't you know that he hasn't got a clue?" 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM That while she's so absorbed in the ideas about what he should know. While she's not doing a particularly good job of sightseeing... 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:15
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...Seeing who he really is and the fact that there are some people that just need things spelled out and then what you discover is whether they have the ability. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM What a difference between someone's motivations and someone's actual abilities. And while you've been puzzling over why people just don't get it, why they don't recognize opportunities to be responsible. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM There's a deeper understanding that you're evolving at this very moment. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM It's one of my favorite tasks that when people want something from someone that they're not getting without ever really knowing. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Does this person even have it. So I send people out to ask for things from other people that they know they don't have. Can I borrow your yacht for a weekend? Can you rent Maui to me? 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Can you trim 50 year of my age? And it seems like a really strange assignment but you can imagine the looks on people's faces when you ask someone that you know who doesn't have a yacht very seriously and earnestly to borrow their yacht. And what other interesting way to absorb the deeper point Astrid(ph) that you never ask someone for something if you don't even know whether they have it be a good idea to master that before you ask for understanding or compassion or empathy or responsibility or even common sense. 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now I can talk about traveling, cultures, imaginary yachts but while I've been talking about these things... 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...You've been absorbing a deeper message. And in just a moment I'd like to check in with you and without disturbing your comfort continuing to enjoy just being focused. You'll find it easy to let your voice describe what you're aware of experiencing right now Astrid(ph). And so if you would now describe for me what you're wearing. 

00:33:40
ASTRID It's more acceptance and, and of difference is limitation and being okay with that. 

00:33:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Acceptance and limitations and being okay with that sounds good. What's the alternative? 

00:34:05
ASTRID Not knowing. 

00:34:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Not knowing, wanting and not being sure what a comfortable position to be in to start to think in terms of what you want and you can wonder why you'd have to tell 'em what you want. But I think you have lots of samples of behavior to know if you don't spell it out it's gone. And even when you're very sure that what you want is a yacht will it be nice to know first. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM But just absorbing it's a different perspective, a different experience. What a shift Astrid(ph) to think it's your limitation. 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM What a difference to enjoy the comfort of knowing that the things you want can make perfect sense. 

00:36:20
[sil.] 

00:36:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM It doesn't mean the other person can provide it. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I remember in one of these demonstrations once, a young man coming up who is new to the field and he said in his previous job he felt quite confident in his abilities and then comes to the therapy field and has lots of downs. It didn't help that his supervisor was even laterally critical had the teaching style, the-- I'm gonna teach you what you did wrong. And so he always felt like he was making mistakes and was inadequate. And what a curious thing how many parents there are. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM That if you do something right, they don't say much about it and if you do something wrong they're all over you. But it helps to know how to recognize strengths. The things that people can do and might be different... 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...And even now I wonder whether you've noticed the shift in your breathing. You haven't moved much Astrid(ph) and to be listening and to have lots of different thoughts and feelings and awarenesses. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM How curious when you discover smack in the middle of that familiar kind of interaction where being disappointed is a half step away. What comes bubbling up is when you ask yourself why am I asking this person for a yacht and the extraordinary relief. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM It isn't exactly what you would have wanted but what an extraordinary thing to have a comfort that just wasn't there before when you're so clear it isn't about you and you might have a very different response now to the question I started with. How do you know when you can trust someone to be true to who they are and you being insightful enough to know what they can do and what they can't. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I have a cartoon show sometimes. We're talking about these things in workshops. A woman is looking rather distressed with her boyfriend and a caption reads, if you really loved me you'd win the lottery. And I wonder whether she has any clue at all that what she's asking for is the yacht he doesn't have. And so what will be different in what you ask for. I'll be curious to hear about that. What will be different when you get to go through one more round of realizing. I really know now not much sense in asking for what they don't have to give. And yet, every once in a while somebody says to me but once in a while they do come true and I call that the stopped clock hypothesis. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day but you're not gonna want to count on it. 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And someone said again Astrid(ph), I'd like to check in with you and ask what you're aware of right now. You can describe it easily. 

00:45:00
ASTRID And it's that's okay the way it is. People are doing the best they can and doing the best they can. 

00:45:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So if you absorb that, what would it mean. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM A very different response on your part wouldn't it. 

00:45:25
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:45:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM A lot more comfortable, a lot more accepting, a lot less hurt. And then will you know there are inside words and there are outside words and your inside word might be "moron" and your outside words might be "I understand honey". 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And that same smile that just came to your face, let that be the smile that they'll just never understand. Enjoy it, use it and let it be just mysterious enough to really enjoy. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now I've talked about a lot of different things Astrid(ph) and what I'd like to do now is just be silent for about 20 seconds of clock time and give you the chance to absorb it and integrate it. The different awareness of how it feels what you think how it plays out and when I again speak in 20 seconds, my voice can just relax you more deeply. And the 20 seconds of silence begins now. 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And you can just continue to relax, and comfortable. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Isn't it just as I said at the beginning incredibly reassuring that you trusted yourself enough to allow yourself this experience. Having no idea what I was gonna say, what I was gonna do. You trusted yourself enough to consider to accept, to reject... 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...And to just be with that deeper awareness that whatever people say or do, and likewise, whatever people don't say and don't do, it gives you a deeper understanding of the range however narrow or broad it might be of what they're capable of just as here and now you're discovering your ability to broaden your range to be more understanding, to be more realistic. Whether it's about you're politicians, or family members, your friends wouldn't matter who it is. It's about you deepening your trust of yourself to move in this situation with a quiet confidence and a mysterious smile... 

00:52:05
[sil.] 

00:52:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM ...That you know, you just know. 

00:52:20
[sil.] 

00:52:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Take whatever time you'd like to Astrid(ph). That's right. Just start to bring this experience to a comfortable close. Take whatever time you need to or want to to absorb. And then when you feel like you're ready, you can start the process of gradually reorienting yourself. That's right, at a rate that's easy and comfortable reorienting completely. 

00:53:15
[sil.] 

00:53:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Hi, how are you doing? 

00:53:25
ASTRID Good. 

00:53:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Wanna tell me about it? 

00:53:30
ASTRID No, that-- it was, you know, talked initially about other people like my, my family but really is it brought that feeling of peace, ah, as I was listening to you. Reminded me when I had gone sky diving. Actually the, the first time was a tandem jump and that was just a very peaceful experience. But many years later my daughter wanted to outside w-with her and it was a free fall and no experience in between and that did go well. And that was the, the, the, the trusting is they had more to do I, I think, with that which had nothing to do really with my family per se but that didn't go well and I landed in the tree. Uhm, and so that-- I actually felt myself breathing, you know, more anxious as I re-experienced that but, uhm, i-it's just interesting how what I, you know, came-- what I presented isn't what, what actually went through or maybe what was the issues that I needed to deal with. 

00:54:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And so where did that go for you? 

00:54:40
ASTRID A little more... 

00:54:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM That realization. 

00:54:45
ASTRID Yeah. Ah, again, more trusting myself which was with that sky diving experience when I stop listening cuz we had radios and they were telling us what to do when I stopped listening to them and trusting myself cuz they were telling, telling me wrong. They thought I was somebody else. And so, I guess I was listening to their directions. It was-- I was going in circles but when I stopped listening to them, you know, then-- I mean it wasn't-- well it was okay, I'll come I guess except I landed in a tree but, uhm, that was better when I stopped listening to them and really trusted myself. 

00:55:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And even trusting yourself to handle it - 

00:55:30
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:55:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - when you're not sure. 

00:55:30
ASTRID Yeah. 

00:55:30
DONALD MEICHENBAUM It's exactly what just happened here. 

00:55:35
ASTRID Mm-hmm. 

00:55:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You didn't know what was gonna happen here. 

00:55:35
ASTRID No. 

00:55:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM And so when I said that-- any particular reaction to it? 

00:55:40
ASTRID Yeah, that's... 

00:55:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Just feel it. Sounds like... 

00:55:45
ASTRID Thank you. 

00:55:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Thank you so much for doing this Astrid(ph), appreciate it. We, thank you, we still have about five minutes left. Will you be willing to respond to questions from the group if there are some. 

00:56:00
ASTRID Sure. 

00:56:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM With the five minutes that we have I'd love to use 'em so I'm, I'm willing to respond to questions that you have any questions for Astrid(ph) about her experience if you wouldn't mind coming up to the mike and, and let's take advantage of the fact that she's here and she can tell you about it from a purely subjective point of view. Are there any questions? One over there. So you can ask Astrid(ph) if you'd like about her experience or you're, you're all curious about the process I'm happy to respond to questions as well. 

00:56:35
 Is anyone up? No? 

00:56:35
 Do you have? 

00:56:40
 There we go. 

00:56:40
 Astrid(ph), did you know that all that was in there? 

00:56:45
ASTRID Well, I, I mean I, I obviously have those experiences but when I came up here I was-- no. I, I, I was really surprised that that sense of peace triggered that first very positive experience that was directly linked then to this much more negative experience. 

00:57:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So that, so your sense of not being able to trust people was not linked to the sky diving and the tree experience prior to this. 

00:57:10
ASTRID Uhm, I, I think there have been some. I mean my mother died when I was a kid so I think there was some not trusting and that was my intellectual awareness but the probably more recent kinda not being able to trust others, needing to trust their selflessness was the sky dive experience and that was I think the more relevant one now. 

00:57:35
 Sure. I think you're speak for all of us too cuz I don't think any of us saw that coming. It was pretty amazing, thanks for doing that. 

00:57:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Thanks for your question. 

00:57:45
 Hi. Thank you for the demonstration. I would just like to know, uhm, I mean, I've never seen, ah, a session like that with a the therapist is talking so much. So I was just wondering wh-- wha-- what-- how did you know what to say? Where to go? I mean, you just kept on so are you tuning in with the-- what are you doing. I mean because I guess you can easily lose a thought. Can you put a few words on that? 

00:58:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I-- but you see the whole idea is she presents an issue to me - 

00:58:15
 Mm-hmm. 

00:58:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - and I already have a pretty good idea what's missing here - 

00:58:25
 Okay. 

00:58:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - where the connection isn't happening. 

00:58:25
 Yeah. 

00:58:25
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So I'm using my language as the focal point to start to build associations that weren't there as you're hearing her describe. 

00:58:35
 Yeah. 

00:58:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So you're using your language to grab the person's attention and start to build these linkages. Hypnosis cures nothing. It's what happens during these experiences and it isn't logical, it's a much more felt kind of an experience as the person gets more absorbed in it. But the-- but you'll notice also how often I'm checking in with her. Okay, where are you now, where are you now, where are you now? So, you know, it's a, it's a more interactional thing even though yes, I'm talking a lot but I'm introducing ideas that are meant, that are meant to speak to the essence of here's what's missing in our experience. 

00:59:20
 That makes sense. 

00:59:20
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Now, I, I wanted Astrid to be absolutely clear by the time the session was over. Trust doesn't exist outside in the world. Trust exists in your ability to cope with whatever happens out in the world for her to be able to reach inside herself and pull out the resources she needs when she needs them to handle the fact that this person just said something really mean or this person did something really irresponsible. So that instead of being it painful and turning against herself, she could flip it an be able to say, you know, that wasn't particularly swift on their part. 

00:59:55
 Okay, thank you. 

01:00:00
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay, sure. Anything else? 

01:00:00
 Forward. 

01:00:00
 Yeah, I have a question over here. 

01:00:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Where are you? 

01:00:05
 I'm hiding behind the podium, over at the side - 

01:00:05
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

01:00:05
 - to your right. 

01:00:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Okay. 

01:00:10
 Uhm, one of-- certainly, ah, in the beginning of the presenting problem, ah, was revolving around the issue of, of, you know, not being able to trust yourself and trust is this internal thing. You can't really rely upon other people to make your-- you trust them. Uhm, but one of the things that I felt are saying at the beginning was that she wanted to be closer to people and that she have felt, ah, kind of, I don't know, you can cross-- correct me if I'm wrong Astrid(ph) but, ah, kind of ashamed or guilty or bad about this distance that she created by being so independent. Uhm, how do you feel, ah, this maybe affected by, uhm, focusing so much on her own individuality of her own self. 

01:00:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM I think you missed - 

01:00:55
 Oh, that's why I'm asking, yeah. 

01:00:55
DONALD MEICHENBAUM - an extremely salient piece of it when you heard her say how she could be so much more accepting. What do you think that will do for the relationships? 

01:01:10
 Sure, sure. 

01:01:10
DONALD MEICHENBAUM That's the inner personal argument. This isn't all on one level. It's about her relationship with herself but it also then plays out with how she adjust her expectations of other people, how she learns to be more tolerant when people do things that aren't necessarily the nicest of brightest things to do. You know, to, to be that much more accepting, that much more realistic about other people and to therefore be able to have a much easier time in the relationships. 

01:01:40
 Hmm, okay. 

01:01:40
DONALD MEICHENBAUM So to me, to me it's important, both pieces there. The internal part but also the external part. 

01:01:45
 Oh, sure. Yeah, thanks. 

01:01:50
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Thanks. We, we-- one more and then we better stop there because we're already running over. 

01:01:55
 I, I guess this is a similar question to the one asked before given the relatively little amount of information that you got at the beginning and even during what was going on and then translating that into the entire content to what you were saying. Uhm, how would somebody who is new to therapy, ah, how does one, how does one get to the point where they can hear a theme such as, uhm, trust and then kinda automatically know, "Okay, we're gonna have to go to acceptance, we're gonna have to go to judgment." 

01:02:35
DONALD MEICHENBAUM You know, therapy is a remarkably redundant business. You know, I'm, I'm really trying to remember the last time I heard a new story. You know it's, it's new because it's the unique individual I'm dealing with but all of us-- it's-- there's, there's a pretty finite range of experiences that we share as human beings. And so there are these repetitive themes and the variations come with style and gender and age and experience and all the-- all those what I think of as being more cosmetic kinds of things. But at the level beneath that, all of us are struggling with that same issue. How do we find security in an insecure world and, you know, if we, if we look for the right person to feel secure with, what happens when they disappear or if we look for the right job to feel secure in. What happens when the budget dried up or if we look for the right-- there i-- that message that I was giving Astrid(ph) that there isn't security in the world, there's security in your ability to manage that to me is the most empowering part of this whole process. But to speak to the heart of your question, that's the artistry of therapy. You're-- any session, hypnosis or any approach is only as good as it's targets and what to me is very clear is that the difference is in qualities across therapists is how they hear people are telling and where they go with that. You know, some, somebody else might have gone to mother, somebody else might have gone to childhood experience of being embarrassed, somebody else might have gone to the last fight she had with her husband, somebody else might have gone to you. Those are all content. And wha-- what is the me-- what does it matter which story it is. It's what she concludes about herself and about people on the basis on that experience is really my major target. So we better end there. Again, thank you for coming Astrid(ph). Thank you so much. 

01:04:45
ASTRID Thank you. 

01:04:45
DONALD MEICHENBAUM Really appreciate it a lot. Thank you everybody. Thank you Astrid(ph).
