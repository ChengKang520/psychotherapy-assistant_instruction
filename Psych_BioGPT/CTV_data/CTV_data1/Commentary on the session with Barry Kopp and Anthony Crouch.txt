Commentary on the session 

00:00:10
With Barry Kopp and Anthony Crouch 

00:00:20
ANTHONY CROUCH We're to talk about a short session with you as counselor with a young woman as a client and this is very much, uh… an attempt to illustrate the person-Centered approach and that's your background in Europe. Person Centered counselor and if you wanna say anything about yourself, uh… especially in relation to that. 

00:00:50
BARRY KOPP Umm… I guess I've being practicing as a Peron Centered Counselor for something like 15 years, umm… and I guess what I would say is I, I was also trained in, umm… in other aspects of the person centered family, I was a psychotherapy especially focus in orientate psychotherapy, uh… which is working within a body, experiencing and person's experience, person's experiential psychotherapy, umm… and there we didn't particularly look at that, umm… and here on but I think it's important that person centered is not just Rogerian, there's a whole school, if you're like, umm… 

00:01:35
ANTHONY CROUCH Say, you've trained in a, a number of areas as person centered? 

00:01:45
BARRY KOPP Yes. Yes, which, which, which have a symbol philosophy of work. 

00:01:45
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, okay. So the session is as it say, quite shorten yet, for me, does achieve with client quite a lot. It goes quite a long way. I don't know how you experienced, uh… the session. 

00:02:10
BARRY KOPP Umm… I think in terms of demonstrating person centeredness, I, think with session to the start to… 

00:02:25
[sil.] 

00:02:30
BARRY KOPP Develop a depth. Umm… I think certainly in all my part as the therapist the, there were moments when there was a struggle to fully understand, umm… but I think out of that came clarity at times, so I think, you know, within that congruence sometimes within maybe don't quite being where the client was actually brought clarity for both of us, I think at times, umm… the client was struggling to fully understand where she was. 

00:03:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes. 

00:03:05
BARRY KOPP Umm… 

00:03:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Well, I think in many ways that's what she says. That's what it was about really, it was about her beginning to look at this, well, she said, she hadn't talked about this before. 

00:03:15
BARRY KOPP And it was a little bit of holding, yeah, and I think she says that ready towards the end of, umm… when we were coming towards them to the session that she was very aware as still holding the stuff in there, she was really just starting to talk around it rather than what was also going on the inside. 

00:03:35
ANTHONY CROUCH But the need to want, the real pain to come out. 

00:03:35
BARRY KOPP Didn't want to share it to me or anyone else and yet at the same time I was saying that this is the first time I've been able to start to talk no one else would understand what I'm talking about. Somehow being able to start to reveal that and I think quite a gentle manner, a gentle presence with 

00:04:00
ANTHONY CROUCH And more than just understand is it, because they wouldn't understand they would then reject me. 

00:04:00
BARRY KOPP Yes 

00:04:05
ANTHONY CROUCH The implication of being, which you draw out I think about two thirds way through the session approximately. 

00:04:10
BARRY KOPP And that's sort of, sort of comes by I think to the theory of that, you know, I feel that I has a regard for hard as client. She was able to start in some, some small way to trust me to start to reveal that I was going to reject her which I use to, I think is an important part of building that relationship. 

00:04:35
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, as it begins, you're right, as she begins to trust you and trust herself. She hasn't open fully, umm… but she's begun the process really. 

00:04:45
BARRY KOPP And starting to express that anger, umm… towards but slightly towards her mother has who's abandoned, umm… and towards her father and the new family as there all sorts of things starting to on the surface level come out, umm… 

00:05:00
ANTHONY CROUCH And we, 'cause we, we've talked about, uh… and then that, uh… earlier on we talked about the, umm… the developmental dimension of the CP-Zvi model and worked with past in it and this is actually quite a good example what she does very much bring this in quite early on, she mentions about her mother and that, that the divorce and a mother leaving her and so it wasn't it was, it was and that if, for me looking in the session and not being a person centered counselor, you know, umm… I've, my own background is counseling psychology and within that I began, uh… as a psychologist when I was counseling psychologist. As a psychologist I began in a cognitive development. And, when I, umm… moved to the counseling psychology, I went first for the transfers still in the humanistic. And I know the person centers within that. But I, what I was very much more into, much more active on Gestalt psychotherapy and before then a few years later I got very interested in Psychodynamic, so I'm quite integrated but I'm not person centered and they've already trained in the person sensed approach. But, for me watching that as a kind of integrative counseling psychologist and it did feel very you felt you were gently following this person that was in the in over all sense of what which if I was looking at somebody else like it, we have from a psychodynamic or CBT, it was effective, I probably wouldn't get that as the number one that was the foreground and that you were very gently following this person. And yes, you were coming in with some, umm… certain types of intervention but they, they're of, they were all, you know, arising from what the client was saying really. 

00:07:00
BARRY KOPP And, I think that's quite important. I said, I think one of the things I also do is a sort of clinical supervision and I get supervisees sort of asking that, sort of saying to me, what do you think that's what the client meant and that it will help, I'm not quite sure I would know but did you not check that out with the client in that moment, well no, I'm sort of assuming that and I think there's something about that very, you would use the word track in very carefully tracking what the client is saying and being in that moment, by moment contact with the client and I think there's one part where I draw that sort of link back to the mother because it's present. It's also seem to be present in what she was saying in that moment and so is… is about sort of for me, that moment by moment journey but also everything that's come before can be part of where we are in the in the moment, so sort of drawing those links or, or checking whether I'm quite with what's being said if I makes sense, so is what I was thinking the same was whether what we claim to be thinking so I'm checking out by understanding on a constant, umm… basis rather than assuming that that is what is meant and I think that is in places where I haven't quite got what like, what she's saying and by check him out that comes this clarity, you know, only for myself but I think also for the client to as well. 

00:08:45
ANTHONY CROUCH So that's very much about developing the empathic, empathy for the client developing an empathic relationship, attempting to really understand this client and how they see the world. And, it's clear that you're, you're doing that throughout, oh, that's a kind of, that's the core really of the, of the process. Umm… what about the, the other core conditions like, ah… are there any moments in the session or any aspects of the session that you'd point to in relation to other, you know, of the other crock editions? 

00:09:25
BARRY KOPP Yeah. Umm… Well, I'm hoping from ruling the relationship would be the congruence(ph) that it and, I think, you know, those movements certainly were there's a sense of for me struggling to fully capture where the client is, umm… I guess she's my congruence(ph) because I'm not assumingly know, I'm checking out whether where I'm is where the client is if that's what the client is meaning, umm… and I think there's one movement were the client questions what I'm, what I've reflected if lay or, or what've said, umm… 

00:10:05
ANTHONY CROUCH Yes, I seem to remember there was a moment, when I think you said something about fear. 

00:10:15
BARRY KOPP You're frightening him 

00:10:15
ANTHONY CROUCH And she said well, she thought about it and said no, it's not fear and then you kind off that shifts, so yeah, so that's, have you don't, you know, you follow the cloud basically… 

00:10:30
BARRY KOPP Yes, Yes… 

00:10:30
ANTHONY CROUCH And it take anywhere out. 

00:10:30
BARRY KOPP But, but, I think that's all part of that developing empathy that sort of congruence(ph) is I'm not assuming but what I'm experiencing is necessary the same was the clients. I'm continually tracking that out, umm… I guess in a real way, umm… For the client, you know, I think sometimes, umm… you know, clients we mean one thing, and then when you reflect it back, actually it's not quite what we meant and in a very that very Phenomenological way we get somewhere we get to what the right experience is what the right mean what the right feeling is. Umm… so I guess that's my congruence(ph) within session. Umm… and I hope that in some way that I'm shall experience my unconditional regard of actually wanting to understand, wanting to meet, how well was, umm… 

00:11:35
ANTHONY CROUCH Certainly that was also in a way of her from my perspective is integration cast psychologies that was her, umm… that was of her at the center of her issue if you like. The, the lack of that, the sense of worthlessness, the sense of her mother just left her and didn't know really why and therefore she's like blaming ourselves perhaps or forfeiting and, and… 

00:12:00
BARRY KOPP Not being able to care for herself. I think like that was where, we're sort of started… 

00:12:05
ANTHONY CROUCH She wasn't well caring for. 

00:12:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah, and I followed this university year and, you know, the very sort of service level A that we're talking about earlier the life event if you like which has led to what's behind all of that, oh, what's going on through the self. 

00:12:20
ANTHONY CROUCH And, and really the kind of main let's face it. In terms, the internal we have there, have mask and her hidden herself very much. She, she, she, she articulate that herself. 

00:12:30
BARRY KOPP At her own conditions of worth were either I go out I get drunk. I do these stupid things. I don't care for myself, but underneath actually there's this wounded child that, that doesn't at least caring for but doesn't want to ask anyone to care 'cause no one else will understand because I've abandoned, umm… which I guess would be an interpretation but it's a sense of maybe what she was coming for. 

00:13:00
ANTHONY CROUCH And also the, you know, there's a, the pattern of relating as well, that, that as the second dimension that we talked about and, and obviously the past which she brings up right, you know, within the first two minutes, I think three minutes, she, she references a divorce and, and loss of a mother and how that's still impacts her life. And, she sees it as the kind of becomes clears that she sees that as core to her problems really. And, changing the way she relates to that past is, is what is beginning there and by the end of the session. 

00:13:40
BARRY KOPP I think by the end of the session of those a grown awareness of what it's all about and it's a starting place. 

00:13:50
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, so the positive regard is actually something that, you know, where she took continues to experience this, would be something she could take away? 

00:14:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah, I know, I think… 

00:14:10
ANTHONY CROUCH That would be very valuable 'cause it's, like contrast with her to core sense of feeling worthless and a mother abandoning her. 

00:14:15
BARRY KOPP And, yeah, as, as a therapist, if, if I can somehow give that regard what I think I was sharing in that session for her to be able to reveal what she revealed because in some ways what she was saying this is the first time that I've started to talk about this , um what I think if she wasn't experiencing that regard that I want this person and I want to know you and, and, and I have a, and I value you enough to wants to know and not judge you. But I'm here to understand what, you know, what, what's happening for you and where you're coming from and to meet you in your world not in my world, you're like. 

00:15:00
ANTHONY CROUCH I know that as I say, as I said at the beginning there was a sense, real sense of a kind of gentle following of the client and real listening and checking out what you're hearing and I suppose, you know, as a non- person-centered- practitioner. It's kind of amazing how far you got, you know, after that, right? ' Cause, umm… In other words you didn't need all of the fancy technique some treatment sort of that to get actually somewhere really quite valuable. 

00:15:40
BARRY KOPP And which is what workers (ph) are saying. That is about the relationship and I think… 

00:15:45
ANTHONY CROUCH But also though before you going on, I'm sorry. I was gonna also say that, it that, there's a lot hidden I think, umm… in terms of what you're doing because mostly what you're doing is listening and within that providing the positive regard and the congruence(ph), you know, someone's listening you don't really see what they're doing, but actually quite a lot is going on, on your side of things it's just you see it. 

00:16:20
BARRY KOPP Cause of very close to listening, it's paying very careful attention to and maybe this didn't come out quite so much in the session to what I'm hearing but what I'm also experiencing within the room, so in a sense, 10% of it normally is just what you're hearing but the other 90% is what, what is being communicated which is not being said between, umm… the client. 

00:16:50
ANTHONY CROUCH But this sounds very, very thoughtful and again it's like I wouldn't have known this, so I just watched the session. So do you wanna a little more? 

00:16:55
BARRY KOPP I gotta try and articulate it, there's quite difficult I guess it's, I guess is that if paying full attention and full awareness to everything that I am experiencing when I am hearing what the client is saying and then somehow, use that word reflecting it back, have I actually captured the full meaning of not what just has been said but what is unsaid as well. Am I on the right track? So it's part of that congruence(ph) you like is, is being willing to say, oh, I'm not sure if I'm right but to little bit as put that always is this what, is this what I'm hearing, is this what you're saying, umm… 

00:17:45
ANTHONY CROUCH And, I suppose what's going through my mind, in those which wasn't person centered right, what's going through my mind is that when you did, uh… I'm just thinking when you meant, when you mentioned to her about, umm… fear being frightened inside of her own and you've known what I'm thinking is, uh… given the, you know, the session as a whole and way you got to and the fact that there is a locked covered of deep hurt, there is going to be some fear from my perspective, my interpretive respect to there's definitely gotta be ways of fear of all of that hurt and maybe she, but if it would maybe she didn't want to touch into that at that moment. 

00:18:25
BARRY KOPP And, I think that, that sometimes… 

00:18:25
ANTHONY CROUCH So might is it I was kind of saying that you may have, you may have been hearing that you're saying what's unsaid and you've, you're fit to say that to her she says no, but maybe on two or three sessions down the lines, she says yes. 

00:18:40
BARRY KOPP Yes, and that almost, that's what I was gonna say as well, that sometimes just by saying something even with the client at that moment in time doesn't quite want to hear that or doesn't even recognize about at a later date it then is able to open up. I think what's really for me is important is if you don't check it out in that moment, it actually can get lost and you can't really bring it back at a later date unless it re-emerges. 

00:19:15
ANTHONY CROUCH That sounds really important as well and what was passing through my mind was something about a real relationship, you know, what's really going on in this relation but this particular moment you have an opportunity to say something, it's a risk, you say anyway, because you can't say it later on 'cause is not real then. 

00:19:30
BARRY KOPP But also, some think about saying it in a way which I'm owning my response. So I'm not just 

00:19:40
ANTHONY CROUCH You're not hiding it. 

00:19:40
BARRY KOPP I'm not hiding it. This is my response and sometimes I don't know, you might've come through it in the session, what, what, what I am doing is I'm also becoming the client when I'm responding, umm… So what I'm saying is, I am whatever it's who was that I've embodied where the client if you get to that point and that, that may not have been in that, in this particular session, umm… but certainly there's also about gentleness, so it's not a, it's not giving it as a fact, it's a gentle response back. 

00:20:15
ANTHONY CROUCH Yeah, it's a possibility. 

00:20:20
BARRY KOPP Yeah, if that make sense. 

00:20:20
ANTHONY CROUCH It's not a, it's not the truth from the expert. 

00:20:25
BARRY KOPP Yes, it's not the truth from the expert, yes. 

00:20:25
ANTHONY CROUCH It's just a possible that as a possibility that in this case. 

00:20:35
BARRY KOPP Is this what you're saying? Is this what you're meaning? Is that what you're experiencing? 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
ANTHONY CROUCH So is there anything else you'd like to say about the session or your experience anything as you would like to how I mean, I just said that, immediately something brought to the… my mind. I did like painting them. I can't remember the exact phrase with something like painting the mask on when she goes out and she's reckless as a way as a way of escaping from the hurt and the, and the fears of rejection of whatever, does that, you, you use the phrase painting this mask on as, you know, as a part of the process and that was a very powerful image for me and I'm sure it would have been for her. 

00:21:25
BARRY KOPP Umm… I guess what I, what've made of, well, I've been trying to do that is, that's my understanding of what she's saying. So sometimes is putting it into a slightly different language, umm… but it's very close to what the client is saying, umm… 

00:21:45
ANTHONY CROUCH It, no. What I mean is there's a, there's a powerful expression. 

00:21:45
BARRY KOPP All right 

00:21:50
ANTHONY CROUCH Of it was like a summary but it was in a colorful metaphor. It wasn't like a classic old, just, you know, seven sentence summary of what she's been saying and yet it didn't encapsulate for me in a kind of powerful metaphor of a painting this. 

00:22:05
BARRY KOPP I think sometimes is just keep it simple, it, it's bad and you know, that's particularly person centered I think is, umm… therapists we all develop our own style of it. I think that's part of being congruent is actually I can't do it like Carl Rogers. I'm not like Carl Rogers and I can only do it as Barry. The same as anyone else can only be themselves as a person centered therapeutic or any therapist as that you're who you are with in your particular model and embody your model in the way that you work but it's also something about, it how you embody or inhabit the model. So you come through, through the model, does that make sense in, perhaps losing myself in that. 

00:22:55
ANTHONY CROUCH I think, umm… I think what you're saying is that just as each person is different each, counseling each of time it's difference maybe, through the experience and practice they develop their own particular uniqueness and individuality and their own personalize, were in personalize but it's their, with your case person centered, umm… counseling and I suppose with that the reason why just, I think I highlighted that metaphor for that picture of painting the face on which goes is because imagining, if I imagine myself to be the client that's probably something I would take away as a kind of powerful image that I might then reflect on. It's like a kind of insight in a way and it didn't come from the expert, it came very much from her, it, it, it was, what was beautiful about it was it. It was a, it encapsulated something really, really important about her experience of the world and her internal conflict. 

00:24:00
BARRY KOPP And, I think that sort of it's quite some, is something quite important that doesn't that work doesn't stop in the 50 minutes you might the client in one week. The, the client goes away and thinks about the session and then, things may change between sessions but that there's an active ingredients between sessions as well. 

00:24:15
ANTHONY CROUCH Well, it, it kind of bit more what was we talked about in a, in when we talked but person centered counseling and research whatever it is the client factors, it's the client engaging in the process so the start softens, you know, the sessions only part of it that clients decline everywhere and I know, just glad in the session. 

00:24:35
BARRY KOPP I think, I've we haven't had more sessions but it would've been interesting to see where that would have developed, umm… If we'd continue to work together. 

00:24:45
ANTHONY CROUCH And, umm… just, you know, kind of more challenging question. Uh… Is there anything you do if you could go back and, uh… change anything. is there anything you'd do differently, uh… anything you've done? 

00:25:00
BARRY KOPP That's quite a challenging question ,umm… 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:15
BARRY KOPP I think in terms of what we were doing. I think it represents all or replicates what I do to with clients, umm… quite well, umm… 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:35
BARRY KOPP I think there might be movements when… 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
BARRY KOPP Perhaps, we could have focused in more on something that would have sad, umm… but maybe that was right all or wrong in a sense, umm… With that of improved what we've done, I'm not quite sure. 

00:25:55
ANTHONY CROUCH So in a sense that was are you saying that there was kind of you going it, in and out in terms of the being able to be with her. 

00:26:05
BARRY KOPP Yeah, and I think, may, maybe… 

00:26:05
ANTHONY CROUCH If you could somehow been with her even more that might have been better. 

00:26:10
BARRY KOPP Yeah or actually for you to focus in on some of the points, umm… but I think in terms of the first session that was probably, you know, that, that was a lot of work to place and it could have taken a different direction, but. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:30
ANTHONY CROUCH Well, as I say I, I found the session. Umm… to really take clients somewhere in that and it was clear at the end of the session that she had found valuable and, uh… 

00:26:45
BARRY KOPP Thank you 

00:26:45
ANTHONY CROUCH Would have continued. Say, good work! Thank you.
