a confidential space ethical considerations when counseling children and young people Peter Jenkins in conversation with Judith Mulcahy a programme from the School of Health & Social Sciences 

00:00:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hello, my name is Judith Mulcahy and I’m program leader for the post-grad program counseling children and young people, here at the University of Wales in Newport. On this DVD, you will see me talking to Peter Jenkins. Peter is a senior lecturer in counseling at the University of Salford and the author of several books on the legal aspects of counseling and psychotherapy. Formerly a member of the BACP Professional Conduct Committee, he is currently a member of the UKCP Ethics Committee and his most recent book co-authored with Debbie Daniels is Therapy with Children, Children’s Rights, Confidentiality and the Law. Peter came into the studio with me to talk about some of the ethical considerations that need to be kept in mind when working with children and young people and the first question I had for him was simply to ask what he saw is being the differences between counseling adults and counseling children and young people from an ethical standpoint. 

00:01:40
PETER JENKINS Okay, um… from an ethical point of view I think that the, the major starting point is obviously that children are more vulnerable… 

00:01:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:01:50
PETER JENKINS …ah than adults in a number of different ways depending upon the their age, the, the, the stage of physical developments. 

00:02:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:02:00
PETER JENKINS The emotional development, the level of cognitive understanding ah… so there has always been a view that in terms of therapeutic work with children they need to be additional safeguards and often additional training for therapists working with children and young people in order to make sure that they are able to take part in therapy in a way that meets their needs, but also it doesn’t place them under particular stresses or strains and would be to the, the disadvantage. 

00:02:35
JUDITH MULCAHY So, so what sort of things should such a training include would you say? 

00:02:40
PETER JENKINS In terms of the competence of therapist work with, with children and I suppose it might be useful to distinguish between children and young people. 

00:02:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… absolutely. 

00:02:50
PETER JENKINS And one suggested definition is that children as the terms relates to children who are in primary school or primary school age so roughly up to about 11. 

00:03:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:03:00
PETER JENKINS And young people is the term that really covers children from the age of about 11… 

00:03:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmmm… 

00:03:10
PETER JENKINS …through to 18, obviously the term child has a legal definition as well. 

00:03:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:15
PETER JENKINS But sometimes I think it's useful to distinguish between the two groups, because it neatly encapsulates the kinds of broad differences that you might expect so that in terms of therapy, in terms of the kind of ethical issues that may come up they, they might be very different for children who are below the age of 11 than a young person who could be say 15, 16, 17 but you know, an older adolescent if you like. 

00:03:45
JUDITH MULCAHY And I guess for both of those age groups there’s, there’s a difference between working with them and working with adults around autonomy, or, or the lack of… 

00:03:55
PETER JENKINS Certainly, um… I mean the way that young people’s entitlement to, to therapy is perceived is I suppose the rule from the, the younger the child… 

00:04:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:04:10
PETER JENKINS …then the greater, the responsibility of an adult to have a, have an overview to, to be mindful of their particular needs to perhaps make decisions which to some extent are made on behalf of the child or the young person, I guess that would also apply for children and people with learning disability again dependent upon what the nature of that disability is it’s very broad phrase, but not to assume that the child, the young person was necessarily capable of entering into therapy at the same level as perhaps an adult. 

00:04:45
JUDITH MULCAHY And I guess there is an issue there and the chronological age and the developmental stage as well. 

00:04:50
PETER JENKINS Sure, yes. 

00:04:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:04:50
PETER JENKINS Yeah. Because I mean what we do now is that although we can be aware that there are developmental stages… 

00:04:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:04:55
PETER JENKINS …I mean we can think about Piaget and Kohlberg and Erikson and so on that they don’t necessarily follow through in… in kind of need packages and it maybe that children of a similar chronological age have very different emotional needs and they have very different levels of understanding and self-awareness, empathy and, and so on and it's really important for therapist to be aware of this obviously to, to tune their… their approach to the needs of the, the child, the young person that they are working with and I think also that there are, there are flows perhaps within therapeutic model itself which is very much, I mean as we are doing now it's a face to face encounter. 

00:05:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:05:40
PETER JENKINS It’s primarily verbal. 

00:05:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:05:40
PETER JENKINS And certainly in my experience, experience of, probably many therapists is that for many children and young people talking in this kind of way it is not necessary the best way of, of making psychological contact that something that’s more active, something that’s more indirect perhaps. 

00:06:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:00
PETER JENKINS It’s going to be much more effective, in fact what we as therapists plays (inaudible ) song which has lot of eye contact and face to face. 

00:06:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:06:10
PETER JENKINS Kind of contact in the way isn’t necessarily going to, to work with perhaps a very inhabited or… 

00:06:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:15
PETER JENKINS …withdrawn or preoccupied young person. 

00:06:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely. And, and I would, I would acknowledge that and say that actually using you know or trying to match communication methods of children and young people is… 

00:06:30
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

00:06:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …is vital. 

00:06:30
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:06:30
JUDITH MULCAHY In such therapeutic encounters. So I’m wondering Peter we are talking about you know their autonomy. 

00:06:35
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:35
JUDITH MULCAHY It brings to mind you know that other adults we were talking about being in their world parents… 

00:06:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:06:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …is a great issue isn’t it? So is it the case that you are saying that as a primary child would need parental permission to enter into such a contract. 

00:06:55
PETER JENKINS Well, I, I think that’s the working assumption that… 

00:06:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:06:55
PETER JENKINS …if we move into the whole area of who gives permission if you like… 

00:07:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:00
PETER JENKINS …for children young people to become involve in counseling and, and therapy, because obviously children and young people are by definition dependent upon adults and other caretakers in, in their lives and the impact of the, the Gillick decisions certainly with young people under the age of 16 in England and Wales and, and the statute in Scotland. 

00:07:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:07:30
PETER JENKINS I think it has opened up the door to offering confidential counseling to young people under the age of 16. 

00:07:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:35
PETER JENKINS And certainly that, that’s the few of the children’s legal center and that that’s I think in why they understood in practice since the mid 1980s. 

00:07:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:07:45
PETER JENKINS What Gillick doesn’t clarify is what is the lowest age if you like… 

00:07:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… absolutely, yeah. 

00:07:50
PETER JENKINS …that a young person can have this mysterious… 

00:07:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:07:50
PETER JENKINS …quality of sufficient understanding, it's interesting we don’t apply this test to adults. 

00:07:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, indeed. 

00:08:00
PETER JENKINS Ah, but the rule of thumb I think to many therapists has been that it's unlikely that a child in primary school would have this sufficient understanding if, if we translate that to mean in terms of say Piaget Schema… 

00:08:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:08:15
PETER JENKINS …that this would be what is called abstract thinking ability to be able to, to look at something from another person’s point of view. 

00:08:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Sure. 

00:08:25
PETER JENKINS To anticipate the consequences of your own actions. 

00:08:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:08:30
PETER JENKINS To be able to look at it in the round rather than simply from this is me and this is how I feel and this is what I want. 

00:08:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:08:35
PETER JENKINS So the issue of parental involvement or permission I, I think becomes much more relevant working with children in primary school. 

00:08:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:08:45
PETER JENKINS But there is a recent legalization but actually turn… 

00:08:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Oh. 

00:08:50
PETER JENKINS Somehow on its head. 

00:08:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:08:50
PETER JENKINS And this is surprisingly is the case of Naomi Campbell. 

00:08:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Right, yes. Yep, yep. 

00:08:55
PETER JENKINS She is an unlucky heroine when it comes to confidentiality and therapeutic work, but Naomi Campbell won a very important case in the House of Lords. 

00:09:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:09:05
PETER JENKINS You might remember she was photographed coming out of Narcotics Anonymous meeting by the Daily Mirror and she sued for breach of privacy. 

00:09:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:09:15
PETER JENKINS And she won her case. And that’s essentially the case was that her attending a therapy session was a private matter. 

00:09:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:09:25
PETER JENKINS Now this is really interesting, because you could use that piece of case law which comes from human rights act to argue that for a child or a young person attending counseling is also a private matter. 

00:09:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:09:40
PETER JENKINS And controversially, parents don’t necessarily have the right to know. 

00:09:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:09:45
PETER JENKINS If the, a child in primary school or a young person in, in secondary school is going to counseling unless the child, the young person makes it very clear that they agree to that. So I mean that’s a particular reading of the Naomi Campbell case, but it certainly throws… 

00:10:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:10:00
PETER JENKINS …throws things into the air I think coming(ph), because the Gillick case we have been working with this for um… about 25 years or so and I think a lot of people have reasonably rounded understanding of that. 

00:10:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:10:15
PETER JENKINS But the law changes as this is not a fixed scenario by any means and I think we also have to, to look at the implication of, of new case law and, and new pieces of legislation as, as they come on to the scene. 

00:10:30
JUDITH MULCAHY So what, what would you say to schools, I mean I have recently have experienced quite a lot of, of counselors recently who had been working at secondary schools and not even in primaries actually… 

00:10:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… 

00:10:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …where school staff have a real issue with this, with parents not knowing that… 

00:10:45
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:10:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …a children in counseling. 

00:10:45
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. 

00:10:45
JUDITH MULCAHY What, what do you have to say about that? 

00:10:50
PETER JENKINS I think this is a real tension and we did some research in Manchester a few years ago and this was a national survey of secondary schools providing counseling um, both in England and in Wales and we found that something like three quarters of secondary schools provided what they described as individual therapeutic counseling which was a very welcome finding, the most surprising thing that we did find was that 40% of secondary schools required evidence of parental permission in order to provide this… 

00:11:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:11:25
PETER JENKINS …individual therapeutic counseling and this was far higher than we could reasonably have expected. So there is a real tension, I think a real conflict between the way that many secondary schools would want to operate and I assume from, from that point of view what they would want would be to have good close working links… 

00:11:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes. 

00:11:45
PETER JENKINS …with parents I mean for it to be a family oriented, a family friendly school, but what does strike me is that for within the educational system and for, for teachers as a profession there seems to be a fairly limited understanding of the right of children and young people distinct from the rights of, of parents. 

00:12:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:12:15
PETER JENKINS So I think there is a temptation or perhaps a pressure to offer counseling in a way what parents are seen to have an oversight of this and parents can if necessary they can give permission or even perhaps withdraw permission… 

00:12:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:12:30
PETER JENKINS …for their child or young person to go to counseling. From the school’s point of view this may seem to be the school working very much in harmony with parental wishes, the difficulty is that, what that does is that it provides parents with a right of veto. 

00:12:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:12:45
PETER JENKINS Over the separate right of the child the young person… 

00:12:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely, yeah. Yeah. 

00:12:50
PETER JENKINS …to access counseling and I guess for, for some young people that it's actually I mean we, we know from the findings within Wales recently that it's family issues that bring young people into counseling. 

00:13:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:05
PETER JENKINS And there maybe a conflict of interest I mean, that the young person concerned is dealing with the bereavement or there are issues within the family they need a separate private confidential space to talk about that, parents and I may speak as a parent myself can feel very threatened to think that… 

00:13:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:13:25
PETER JENKINS …well, our dirty linens been washed in public. 

00:13:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:13:25
PETER JENKINS What are they, what is my child saying? What is the counselor doing with this? And temptation is perhaps to close it down. 

00:13:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely. 

00:13:35
PETER JENKINS And that’s very distinct from what goes on in other professional settings, I mean within, within social work, within medicine and nursing, it's very clear understanding that the child has rights and needs which are absolutely distinct and separate… 

00:13:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes. 

00:13:50
PETER JENKINS …from those parents. Not that you deny parents, I’m not trying to like parents are out of the equation, but that as a social worker you never assume that what the parents want is automatically in the child’s best interest, you look at the two things quite separately and make an assessment similarly with medical procedures. 

00:14:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:14:10
PETER JENKINS What the parents want and what the child is asking for, you have to consider both. So there is something of a lacuna here, I think within education policy and maybe perhaps within the professional training of teachers. 

00:14:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… so not only having to educate teachers as to the nature of therapy, but actually to, to, to these issues as well. 

00:14:30
PETER JENKINS I, I think so yes, yes. I mean the term partnership is used… 

00:14:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:14:35
PETER JENKINS …very widely and, and perhaps overused, but I think there is a job of work to be done and you, you can see it actually happening and taking place where counseling is well embedded within schools and counselors have worked really hard to try to convey what they do, what counseling is about, the benefits of counseling and why they need to work in a particular way, why they need a room… 

00:15:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:15:05
PETER JENKINS …in which to work. 

00:15:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:15:05
PETER JENKINS I mean very often teachers will say well, yes you can have a room, but that concept even a room is necessary a kind of a private space in which you can do… 

00:15:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely and, and sometimes that… 

00:15:15
PETER JENKINS …therapy as well. 

00:15:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …I understand why come rush in and, and come and get some material so, or why there can’t be a window that everyone can look through as they going pass. 

00:15:25
PETER JENKINS Yes, absolutely. 

00:15:25
JUDITH MULCAHY You know, all those sorts of issues on that. 

00:15:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:15:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Come back to your point Peter about children’s rights. 

00:15:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:15:30
JUDITH MULCAHY I know here in Wales that you know, the UN rights of the child is, is, is paramount and wag thinking. 

00:15:35
WAG Welsh Assembly Government 

00:15:35
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:15:35
JUDITH MULCAHY So I am wondering how you see that the tension between interpreting those rights… 

00:15:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:15:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …against the responsibility of, of other adults who were looking after them. 

00:15:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… well I think it's a very welcome step within the Welsh context that my understanding is that the, that the, the Welsh government has set that the, the UN convention of the rights of the job 1989 is going to be a key reference point in terms of… 

00:16:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:16:05
PETER JENKINS …policy and after that it has developed the seven core aims in relation to, to children and young people and this has been a long time coming, uh… I think both the fact that within the full parts of United Kingdom that they are children’s commissioners and all of those interestingly England was the last one to appoint… 

00:16:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yeah. 

00:16:25
PETER JENKINS …the children’s commissioner and the, the UN convention is an international statement about the rights of children, so it's a very welcome development. However, I do see some limitations with the, the UN convention as a statement if you like… 

00:16:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:16:45
PETER JENKINS …about the, the rights of children. Essentially, it's about the rights of children and young people up to the age of 18 in terms of protection um… prevention and participation. 

00:17:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:17:00
PETER JENKINS So there are three broad areas. 

00:17:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:05
PETER JENKINS And clearly these are very important they are from if you like a welfare perspective of adults needing to provide for children and young people. What I think is not well developed within the own convention are issues around autonomy and various people have argued that within the UN convention there is a notion of the evolving capacities of the child which relates to the debate of our autonomy, so what I would point to perhaps within the emphasis on the UN convention while this is very welcome and it is something that’s not parallel for example with, within the English government, that there are some limitations to this. 

00:17:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:17:45
PETER JENKINS It’s still set very firmly within a welfare perspective… 

00:17:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yep, yeah. 

00:17:50
PETER JENKINS …and adult centered perspective about the needs of children and I think that the case for developing children’s rights to autonomy is something which I mean whether that comes out of a reinterpretation of the UN conventional or whether that comes from a different point of the compass, I think it's something which we need perhaps to leave open for the moment. 

00:18:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, and then in practical terms within schools for example or indeed when working in other agencies, you know the involvement of other adults and other services is often a part and parcel of the work that we do, so… 

00:18:30
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:18:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …how, how do you see the maintenance of children’s rights versus the need to sometime share information with, with other helping agencies… 

00:18:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:18:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …sometimes parents. 

00:18:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:18:45
JUDITH MULCAHY And sometimes indeed teachers. 

00:18:45
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. I think there has been a huge shift I mean within perhaps the, the last five or ten years that the information sharing agenda has really grown in terms of its volume and its importance and we can trace this back to speaking as next social worker I mean that… 

00:19:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Oh alright, yeah. 

00:19:05
PETER JENKINS …the whole series of child abuse inquiries going back to Maria Colwell in the mid 1970s and the emphasis in each report was the importance of sharing information to an agencies and so on. And after that eventually the most recent that these reports I suppose would be the Victoria Climbié inquiry report. 

00:19:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:30
PETER JENKINS And again information wasn’t shared and wasn’t, wasn’t hacked(ph) on. What that has produced I think has been some very important government initiatives such as contact point and, and the common assessment framework. 

00:19:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:45
PETER JENKINS And the importance of professionals working across professional boundaries and sharing information for the benefit of the child. 

00:19:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:19:55
PETER JENKINS I think that there is a risk again that within that process, the needs and rights of the child can on occasion be overlooked. 

00:20:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:20:05
PETER JENKINS And where a child is happy for information to be passed on assuming that they have some grasp of where the information is going to and who… 

00:20:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:15
PETER JENKINS …who is going to be acting on this and what the outcomes maybe, that very often children and young people has something swept alone by process of information being passed around to, to different agencies. 

00:20:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:25
PETER JENKINS And that’s one of the areas where a sense of a lack of control on that part… 

00:20:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:30
PETER JENKINS …begins to be experienced very strongly, so you have a tension between the needs of agencies to communicate and the position of the child the young person within that… 

00:20:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… where once again they don’t have an autonomy in fact. 

00:20:50
PETER JENKINS Well, with, I suppose within certainly with a counseling setting… 

00:20:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:20:50
PETER JENKINS …it's the offer of confidentiality I’m not arguing confidentiality is, is open ended or… 

00:20:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:00
PETER JENKINS …or total but it's that offer a promise of confidentiality that may mean that the child discloses abuse or difficulties and relationships or whatever or perhaps risky activity… 

00:21:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:10
PETER JENKINS …that they are involved in. Agencies may then respond to that information is then shared and the young person is then swept along within a process which they don’t necessarily… 

00:21:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:21:25
PETER JENKINS …sign up to because it's difficult for a child to fully understand what the outcome is going to be it's difficult for parents and adults… 

00:21:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:21:30
PETER JENKINS …I think to do that. 

00:21:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah absolutely. 

00:21:35
PETER JENKINS So with the information sharing agenda is now very firmly established but again even from a policy point of view it's interesting that research has suggested that within 70s and to the 1980s, so a lot of the child abuse inquiries indicated failures of communication and agencies not sharing information. The more recent inquiries it's over the last decade and a half it's suggested that it's much less about failure to share information and it's much more about assessing the significance of the information that agencies have. 

00:22:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:22:10
PETER JENKINS And that’s a very different argument I think, because that really points to social workers and teachers and other professionals being able to accurately use the information they have… 

00:22:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:22:25
PETER JENKINS …rather than saying I haven’t got enough information to make a decision. 

00:22:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:22:30
PETER JENKINS So I think there is a floor if you like within whole information sharing agenda, that bureaucracies has been a very hungry for information… 

00:22:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:22:40
PETER JENKINS …and the indication is that many social workers spend by 80% of their time in front of computer screen filling in forms, doing assessments and so and more and more information doesn’t necessarily need to better quality assessment or event where affective child protection interventions. 

00:23:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely and this, this brings us to the, to the neb of it I think there is tension between child protection and children’s rights. 

00:23:05
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:23:05
JUDITH MULCAHY And you know what are the risks involved in not passing something on that we are thinking we should or should, you know we may pass… 

00:23:10
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:23:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …on we may not, because many counselors find themselves in a situation where they know that they are supposed to pass that information by safe guarding policies that they wanted. 

00:23:25
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:23:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Um, but by doing so they will be possibly ensuring that child loses it's only source of… of support. 

00:23:35
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. I think it’s extremely complex situation and I wouldn’t like to under estimate the difficulties that are faced by the, the counselor in that situation or by the child or young person, by the family, by the agencies which are there to safeguard the child I mean it is a very, very difficult situation. I think where a child is making a disclosure and they give that consent to the information… 

00:24:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:00
PETER JENKINS …being passed on then hopefully the outcome of that process will be… 

00:24:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:10
PETER JENKINS …as positive as it can be. 

00:24:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:24:10
PETER JENKINS I mean the, the intervention by children services the, and perhaps interviewing by the police, if it goes to court, I mean all of this can have a very difficult and profound effect on the child and family relationships and it can lead to re-traumatizing the child… 

00:24:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:30
PETER JENKINS …to some extent. But hopefully that will be a positive route to follow. 

00:24:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:24:35
PETER JENKINS I think the difficulty that I perceive and that many counselors bring to my attention is where the child makes a disclosure, but they also are saying at the same time, but I don’t want this information… 

00:24:45
JUDITH MULCAHY That’s right, yeah, yeah. 

00:24:50
PETER JENKINS …to be reported… 

00:24:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:24:50
PETER JENKINS …and that’s the difficulty. 

00:24:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:24:50
PETER JENKINS And of course one answer is just to say well this is the contract, this is the consent that we agreed right at the beginning. I hear what you are saying about your reluctance for the information to go on. 

00:25:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:25:05
PETER JENKINS But I’m obliged to do that. Now, my concern is that the young person’s autonomy in that situation is in danger of being eclipsed and I think that also the way that perhaps organizations and policy makers understand the notion of a disclosure is perhaps very different to the way the therapists may understand that… 

00:25:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yeah. 

00:25:30
PETER JENKINS …without wanting to, to some pressures or… 

00:25:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, hmm… 

00:25:35
PETER JENKINS …as if we, we need to be mavericks in someway outside of established process, but I think the evidence is the way young people disclose abuse or major difficulties in terms of relationships or risk, risky behavior they are involved in that very often they do that on the basis of their own pragmatic assessment of the relationship with the person to whom they are disclosing that they have made some kind of assessment… 

00:26:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:00
PETER JENKINS …this teacher or this family member, this counselor perhaps is somewhat they strike me as being sound and that I can tell them this… 

00:26:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:26:10
PETER JENKINS …then they won’t be shock they will understand. 

00:26:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:26:15
PETER JENKINS They, they will help in someway. So, it's really in terms of the interpersonal relationship that they are making, what is a very risky decision because they don’t know how the person is going to respond. If the counselor immediately then feels obliged to pass the information on… 

00:26:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:26:30
PETER JENKINS …and the young person is not giving them the consent then that’s a very powerful message to the young person, in terms of I suppose the, the capacity to judge integrity… 

00:26:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:26:45
PETER JENKINS …or truth telling or fidelity or whatever kind of framework we want to put on that and I think what is very challenging is for the counselor or therapist to work with the ambivalence of the young person in making that disclosure, again I think for many therapists a disclosure is not a discreet event, it's not this happened on this day with this person that from my own experience I think very often a disclosure is… is fragmentary… 

00:27:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:27:15
PETER JENKINS …it's allusive in the sense that you can kind of see something coming down the road towards you, you have the sense of what this might be about… 

00:27:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:27:25
PETER JENKINS …there are things unsaid which is powerful as the… 

00:27:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:27:25
PETER JENKINS …as the actual description of perhaps an abusive incident or whatever and it's also sequential that the information comes out in bits and pieces, it doesn’t come out as a finished job law(ph) and as a therapist particularly why the young person is saying I’m telling you this, but I don’t want you to pass it on… 

00:27:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:27:50
PETER JENKINS …because I don’t want my step-dad to go to jail, I don’t want to go into care, I don’t want the family to be broken up. 

00:27:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:27:55
PETER JENKINS All these concerns which may or may not be based in fact that it's really important for therapist to acknowledge that and to work with that, I’m not arguing necessarily that therapist should never report in that situation. 

00:28:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:28:10
PETER JENKINS And somewhat is the risk to the child and what is the risk perhaps to other siblings in the family and… and sometimes these risks can be very severe, but that there needs to be the professional space for the therapist to work with that, it's much better for the child to make a disclosure and for them perhaps to, to make the own report to child protection services or to do it with the support of the counselor rather than it for be… 

00:28:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:28:35
PETER JENKINS …it to be a conflicted disclosure, the very real risk is that the child makes it a disclosure to the therapist, the therapist acts on it. And without the child’s active consent, the risk I would suggest is the child is then retracts… 

00:28:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Which often happens… 

00:28:50
PETER JENKINS …the disclosure. 

00:28:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …yeah. 

00:28:55
PETER JENKINS And of course… 

00:28:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:28:55
PETER JENKINS …I mean it's much easier to have information about the number of disclosures or number of social services interventions and children on child protection plans and so on. 

00:29:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:29:05
PETER JENKINS The, the scope of retraction… 

00:29:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:29:05
PETER JENKINS I mean anecdotally I… I would think is um… it, it's very significant but it's very personal event. 

00:29:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:29:15
PETER JENKINS And it's not likely to appear in any child protection statistics. 

00:29:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, that was an, a very interesting point you make and I would agree with you that there are huge number of retraction… 

00:29:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:25
JUDITH MULCAHY …certainly many would(ph) have this experience. 

00:29:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:25
JUDITH MULCAHY And, and of course within the, when working within an organization what tends to happen is that the counselor is told once there has been a disclosure that they have to actually actively stop the session, record what’s being said. 

00:29:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:40
JUDITH MULCAHY And, and in fact stop therapy because then they are not been allowed to continue the therapeutic relationship whilst there are child protection proceedings… 

00:29:50
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …which, which goes against all that you have just been explaining about in other therapeutic relationship. 

00:29:55
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:29:55
JUDITH MULCAHY And that the model they have for future in the subjective you know, exchanges with anybody. 

00:30:05
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. My colleague Debbie Daniels, the co-author of the book Therapy with Children, she, I think she would say from a psychodynamic point of view as you have actually crossed a boundary… 

00:30:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yeah. 

00:30:15
PETER JENKINS …at that point. 

00:30:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:15
PETER JENKINS And certainly from a legal point of view the, the therapeutic process stops and what then happens is something called pre-trial therapy so again as you say… 

00:30:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:30:25
PETER JENKINS It’s covered by very specific protocols. 

00:30:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:30
PETER JENKINS And that’s understandable because in relation to the needs of the co-process then the crown prosecution service need to be very aware of the, the nature of the therapy that’s going on they needs to be supportive that it doesn’t rehearse evidence it doesn’t contaminate… 

00:30:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:45
PETER JENKINS …the evidence and so on. The myth that therapy actually has to stop physically at that point… 

00:30:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:30:50
PETER JENKINS …hopefully is no longer current. 

00:30:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:30:50
PETER JENKINS But I think it's a very good illustration of where the therapeutic process which is whereas an intense, it's an interpersonal relationship and which is that would help the young person to explore that their material and their emotions and feelings and situation, becomes overtaken… 

00:31:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:31:15
PETER JENKINS …by a much more public process if you like. 

00:31:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:31:15
PETER JENKINS As you say the, the records the therapist keep then become records of, of document… 

00:31:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:25
PETER JENKINS …records which are accessible within the co-process and so the whole nature of the therapeutic work I think really has to change and no doubt the young person will experience that as well. 

00:31:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:35
PETER JENKINS Because the message is well, these are things which we can’t re-talk about… 

00:31:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:40
PETER JENKINS …until after the court case. 

00:31:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:31:45
PETER JENKINS Whereas up until that point then this was something which the young person would be able to talk about and encouraged about, if that was what they wanted to bring to, to the therapy. 

00:31:55
JUDITH MULCAHY And certainly, when we are just talking about psychodynamically, in attachment terms I, I can whilst see that that young person will then you know go back into shame mode… 

00:32:05
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:32:05
JUDITH MULCAHY …rather than any sort of re-achievement that should be, should be happening. 

00:32:10
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. 

00:32:10
JUDITH MULCAHY In terms of pre-trial therapy and my, my understanding also is correct me here if I’m wrong that there has been a ruling it says that actually the needs of the child are paramount now, so whereas all of this maybe the case, we still should put the needs of the child first. I would certainly agree again from the experience that not all, all agencies or police, or… 

00:32:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:32:35
JUDITH MULCAHY …solicitors understand that. 

00:32:35
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:32:35
JUDITH MULCAHY But that actually has been, has been said somewhere. 

00:32:35
PETER JENKINS It's very clear, I mean in the pretrial practice guidance from the crown prosecution… 

00:32:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:32:40
PETER JENKINS …service in 2001 also for vulnerable adults and the most recent guidance is called achieving best evidence. 

00:32:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:32:50
PETER JENKINS And it's absolutely clear that the needs of the, the child or it's a vulnerable adult must come before the needs of the, the legal system. But it's surprising that there is, there are still pockets of resistance to this… 

00:33:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Oh, yes, yeah. 

00:33:05
PETER JENKINS I still hear stories where young people are denied access to therapy on the grounds that the crown prosecution service wouldn’t allow it. 

00:33:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:15
PETER JENKINS So there is, it seems to be a communication problem within the criminal justice system in terms of getting message. 

00:33:20
JUDITH MULCAHY And I think parents, parents are often told this as well… 

00:33:20
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

00:33:20
JUDITH MULCAHY By, by you know people, other people who work within the system which then stops them from, from bringing their child to… to therapy… 

00:33:30
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. 

00:33:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …which is very difficult. 

00:33:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Okay. We, we touched that Peter on, on record keeping and note taking. 

00:33:35
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:33:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Umm… I know this is a huge area… 

00:33:40
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:33:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Umm… in that specific case, again it might be useful to just reiterate the rights around, around records and notes. And again it's my understanding that only a judge has the right to subpoena notes. 

00:33:55
PETER JENKINS The whole area of note taking of who has access to notes is probably I think after confidentiality that this probably the major area of concern to, to therapist working with children. 

00:34:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:34:05
PETER JENKINS Or with adults. 

00:34:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:34:10
PETER JENKINS And there is massive uncertainty now. This is really been I think brought about by the introduction of the Data Protection Act 1998, prior to that where therapists were keeping records it was very much private concern and I would, I would imagine that for many clients that they neither knew the records were being kept or wouldn’t have thought well, I, I would like to see what’s being written about me, even if they asked for that the chances are it could have been turned down. 

00:34:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:34:40
PETER JENKINS There was a very important case brought by Graham Gaskin who was a young man in care of Liverpool Social Services and I mean it's quite pointing because I mean I was a social worker at that time when… 

00:34:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Right, yeah, yeah. 

00:34:50
PETER JENKINS …when he was around, I wasn’t his social worker and he wanted access to his social work records and social services said, “No, you can’t have them, because they are confidential”. I remember having discussions with young people in care, I mean… 

00:35:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… yes, yeah. 

00:35:05
PETER JENKINS …it's a very similar kind of discussions and my response would be what anything you want to know ask me and I will tell you, and they would say no I want to read the file. I say, you can’t do that it's confidential. So confidentiality was something that as a social worker though I could shelter behind and Graham Gaskin actually, I mean his… he was unconventional solution, he broke inter-social services and stole his records, you have read them and return them I’m not suggesting that… that… that, that they do that, but he also more importantly he took his case to the European court of human rights. 

00:35:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:35:45
PETER JENKINS And it was clear that he was going to win at least in part, this court case. 

00:35:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:35:45
PETER JENKINS So it’s very interesting from 1988 suddenly professional records held by social workers, teachers and doctors… 

00:35:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:35:55
PETER JENKINS …which had been 'confidential' up till then suddenly became accessible and you have access to social records… 

00:36:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:36:05
PETER JENKINS …to educational records and to medical records. 

00:36:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:10
PETER JENKINS The door swung open. 

00:36:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:36:10
PETER JENKINS And I think it's from that point that certainly professionals realized that if they recorded something they had to record on the basis that the client, the patient… 

00:36:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:20
PETER JENKINS …the service user in principle could read and is a very salutary discipline to do that… 

00:36:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes, indeed. 

00:36:25
PETER JENKINS …but when you know that you will be accountable for, for what you write. 

00:36:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:30
PETER JENKINS What then followed was the, the Data Protection Act 1988… 

00:36:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:35
PETER JENKINS …that extended this principle of client access to electronic records and to many but not all forms of hand written records. 

00:36:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:36:45
PETER JENKINS And I think the cultural impact of this own therapy has been absolutely massive. So that most therapists work on the principle that they are recording in theory at least is accessible to clients and work within that frame rather than to the idea that well, this is private, this belongs to me, this is something the client will, will never be able to access so it's a very, it's a very powerful discipline, a very useful one I think. So that’s one way in which clients can access records. The, the second route of access is really through the legal system and courts access to records can be made by judges… 

00:37:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:37:30
PETER JENKINS …order um… sometimes the police will try to access records formally or informally… 

00:37:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:37:35
PETER JENKINS …with authority or with, with more questionable means on occasion and this is really to be used within criminal prosecutions or quite often solicitors will also try and access records for the purposes of using them as evidence in civil litigation perhaps claims work, by stress or whiplash injury… 

00:38:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:38:00
PETER JENKINS …and compensation cases and so on. So long rendered answer but I mean there are, there are a different routes of access to records and what it has shown and thrown into very sharp relief is that counseling recording is very singular. It's a distinct professional culture. It's very different medical recording and that it often doesn’t have the kind of factual detail that I think perhaps judges or police officers or the CPS think that it should have… 

00:38:35
JUDITH MULCAHY And that itself causes difficulties… 

00:38:35
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. 

00:38:35
JUDITH MULCAHY …because that that, that prone to interpretation. 

00:38:35
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:38:40
JUDITH MULCAHY And I know of, of records that have been, your counselors who found that their records have been used against their clients… 

00:38:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:38:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …and that’s something quite difficult… 

00:38:45
PETER JENKINS Yes, yeah. That’s again I would go back to the notion of therapy being a very, very private activity between therapist and the client obviously it takes place in a, in a context and an agency, but by definition it's, it's a private interaction and that notion of privacy, a confidentiality of boundaries is to my mind crucial for the client to feel safe enough to disclose very personal, very sensitive material often as you say a very shaming material. 

00:39:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:39:20
PETER JENKINS And what can happen is that the records of that encounter can be taken out of context and then used for very different purposes. 

00:39:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:39:30
PETER JENKINS So for the client who is perhaps bringing a case for, for workplace stress for example against their employer… 

00:39:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:40
PETER JENKINS …should those counseling records be fed into that legal process, then the defense solicitors for the employer will no doubt be looking for material which will invalidate the claim. So… 

00:39:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:39:55
PETER JENKINS …the fact that the, the employee has a history of receiving psychiatric help, history of anxiety, of depression, being on medication perhaps using illicit drugs… 

00:40:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:40:05
PETER JENKINS …perhaps this childhood experiences… 

00:40:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Sure. 

00:40:10
PETER JENKINS I mean that any of the material… 

00:40:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:40:10
PETER JENKINS …can and will be a scribe within the co-process. 

00:40:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely yeah, yeah. 

00:40:15
PETER JENKINS And very often it's not the client’s advantage. Some clients may feel that counseling records can be used to their advantage. 

00:40:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:40:30
PETER JENKINS I mean for example the, the obvious instance is where somebody wants to bring a criminal prosecution against an alleged abuser. 

00:40:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:40:40
PETER JENKINS I mean so… 

00:40:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:40:40
PETER JENKINS …the it's a child or young person or an adult in that situation. So that if you maybe well the records of therapy will help in that process. 

00:40:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yeah. 

00:40:50
PETER JENKINS They may or they may not. 

00:40:50
JUDITH MULCAHY They may not, yeah absolutely, yeah. 

00:40:55
PETER JENKINS And there may well be material in that… 

00:40:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:40:55
PETER JENKINS …which actually can be used to undermine their status as a credible witness. 

00:41:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:05
PETER JENKINS And of course the, the real tragedy is that for many of our clients the effects of abuse… 

00:41:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:10
PETER JENKINS …have led to emotional difficulties or a need for psychiatric care or support… 

00:41:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:15
PETER JENKINS And all of this tends to then… 

00:41:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:41:20
PETER JENKINS …contaminate or color… 

00:41:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:41:20
PETER JENKINS …the status as a, as a witness in a court of law. 

00:41:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:25
PETER JENKINS So we are left with a very low successful conviction right. 

00:41:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yeah. 

00:41:35
PETER JENKINS Right for um, cases of sexual assault, sexual abuse and so on. 

00:41:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:40
PETER JENKINS I mean it’s the… 

00:41:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:41:40
PETER JENKINS The thing is a very… very low. 

00:41:40
JUDITH MULCAHY I have been worked in an abuse agency… 

00:41:40
PETER JENKINS Alright. 

00:41:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Again I totally corroborate that and I think again that there is that tension for therapists in… 

00:41:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …in suggesting to clients they should go forward with, with those… 

00:41:50
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:41:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …sort of cases, because as you say they, they are very often… 

00:42:00
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:00
JUDITH MULCAHY …don’t lead to any prosecutions, but again is that our, is that our… our goal to make. 

00:42:05
PETER JENKINS Well, I guess it's important to acknowledge that for some clients that, it's extremely important for them to have their voice heard that for them to have their, their day in court and for them to, to be involved in reclaiming their status as a citizen to see justice done, this is a extremely important… 

00:42:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:42:25
PETER JENKINS …and very therapeutic. 

00:42:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:42:25
PETER JENKINS And in some cases… 

00:42:25
JUDITH MULCAHY It’s not. 

00:42:30
PETER JENKINS That this will, this will be the successful outcome of a prosecution and I think attitudes within the police and the Crown Prosecution Service have shifted enormously… 

00:42:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:40
PETER JENKINS …in many cases they are very actively supporting this I mean… 

00:42:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yes. 

00:42:45
PETER JENKINS …they are very involved they are very respectful of clients and aware of the… the tensions around the role of therapy and record keeping and so on. 

00:42:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:55
PETER JENKINS But there can be no guarantees… 

00:42:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Nope. 

00:42:55
PETER JENKINS …and it's a… a very, its high risk strategy I think and the risk is always that the client if unsuccessful that they may be re-traumatized by sense of not being… 

00:43:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Indeed. 

00:43:10
PETER JENKINS …believed in court and that they're alleged abuser is… is not punished… 

00:43:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:43:15
PETER JENKINS …and that they have been through a very painful process… 

00:43:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. Hmm… hmm… 

00:43:20
PETER JENKINS …to know greater fact. 

00:43:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely. Coming back to uh… the idea of accessibility to records, since its very pertinent for schools, counselors Peter at the moment. 

00:43:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… 

00:43:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Because umm… counseling records were often kept as part of the child education records… 

00:43:35
PETER JENKINS Yes, Yeah. 

00:43:35
JUDITH MULCAHY …so again there is a massive tension here between where promising confidentiality on the one hand, but… 

00:43:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:43:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …actually this is available to who? Are the teachers, um… parents umm… 

00:43:50
PETER JENKINS Well, again I suppose it goes back to the case of Graham Gaskin because what's Gaskin did in winning his case was to speed up the whole process… 

00:44:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:44:00
PETER JENKINS …of access to specific kinds of records social work, education and health records. 

00:44:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:44:05
PETER JENKINS So, again I think for counselors in schools, there's often a, a temptation to try to frame the record keeping as a personal activity… 

00:44:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:20
PETER JENKINS …so that I'm a school counselor, these are my records, that my record, records… 

00:44:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:20
PETER JENKINS …of my therapeutic work with these children, they're about me, they're about the process… 

00:44:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:25
PETER JENKINS …I, I take them to supervision. Whereas my understanding is that counseling records within a school context, which are essentially being carried out because… 

00:44:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:44:40
PETER JENKINS …the counseling is within the education… 

00:44:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:40
PETER JENKINS …framework. These are technically part of the, the child's education record. 

00:44:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:44:45
PETER JENKINS And as you point out, there is an anomaly that both the child… 

00:44:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:44:50
PETER JENKINS …and the parents can access… 

00:44:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

00:44:50
PETER JENKINS …the record separately, I'm… I'm clearly as, as a therapist that might mean that you choose to keep very brief, very… 

00:45:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:45:00
PETER JENKINS …factual records rather than detailed process recording or… 

00:45:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:05
PETER JENKINS …records which in some ways would embarrass so… 

00:45:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:05
PETER JENKINS …be to the disadvantage of the child. There is a way as I understand it, of blocking parental access where… 

00:45:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:15
PETER JENKINS …it would be felt to be against the child's interest… 

00:45:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Oh good. Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:20
PETER JENKINS …is that I'm buried within the fine print of Data Protection Act, there… there is a sub law(ph)… 

00:45:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Alright, okay. 

00:45:25
PETER JENKINS …that you could, you could quote. But I think again you would need almost a therapist's perception… 

00:45:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:30
PETER JENKINS …that this is a contentious area and the… 

00:45:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:45:35
PETER JENKINS …child's need for pervasive confidentiality… 

00:45:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:35
PETER JENKINS …is distinct from the parents right to know and we are back to that issue… 

00:45:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:45:45
PETER JENKINS …that we talked about. 

00:45:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Sure. 

00:45:45
PETER JENKINS …in terms of um… 

00:45:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:45
PETER JENKINS …almost the child's needs and interest being subsumed… 

00:45:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:50
PETER JENKINS …under those of he parent or the family… 

00:45:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:55
PETER JENKINS …and that lack of… of wider understanding… 

00:45:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… Hmm… hmm… 

00:45:55
PETER JENKINS …that both within law and policy, these can be… 

00:46:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:00
PETER JENKINS …very, very carefully separated out. 

00:46:00
JUDITH MULCAHY And of course, that, that can almost work backwards as well where a parent or member of staff in deed, speaks to a school counselor and, and more or less insists such… such a child… 

00:46:15
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …should be seen… 

00:46:15
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …or, or expresses their concerns or worries about same(ph) child… 

00:46:20
PETER JENKINS Sure. Yes, yeah. 

00:46:20
JUDITH MULCAHY …and, a sort of information gathering in a, in a, in a backward sense, so… 

00:46:25
PETER JENKINS Yes, yes. I mean talking to school counselors this, this is kind of um… 

00:46:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Common. 

00:46:30
PETER JENKINS Ad-hoc… 

00:46:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:46:30
PETER JENKINS …interventions on the corridor… 

00:46:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:46:30
PETER JENKINS …so you know how is… 

00:46:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:35
PETER JENKINS …so… 

00:46:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:35
PETER JENKINS …my child getting owned(ph) or have you so and so… 

00:46:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:35
PETER JENKINS …I'm very concerned about them… 

00:46:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:40
PETER JENKINS …and I guess part of what counselors develop through working within a complex organization… 

00:46:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:46:45
PETER JENKINS …like a school is how to… to work with and how to parry those kinds of veiled requests for, for information perhaps very direct request because again on the one hand, they need to have a working relationship with their teaching colleagues, with parents, but they need to prioritize the privacy and confidentiality of these counseling service and I think that takes enormous skills if you like… 

00:47:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Diplomacy. 

00:47:10
PETER JENKINS …and diplomacy. 

00:47:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:47:15
PETER JENKINS So that other people can understand… 

00:47:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:15
PETER JENKINS …that its not a brush off, its not personal… 

00:47:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:20
PETER JENKINS …but I need this in order to be able… 

00:47:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:20
PETER JENKINS …to do my job. 

00:47:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:25
PETER JENKINS And I think also from the point of view, the way that young people perceive the role of the school counselor… 

00:47:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:30
PETER JENKINS …that to see the counselor chatting and laughing… 

00:47:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:47:35
PETER JENKINS …with teachers on… 

00:47:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:47:35
PETER JENKINS …the corridor, I mean again a very sensitive shock might misread that… 

00:47:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:47:40
PETER JENKINS …and they might be… 

00:47:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:47:40
PETER JENKINS …hypersensitive to the suggestion that information is passing… 

00:47:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:45
PETER JENKINS …without, without their… 

00:47:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:47:45
PETER JENKINS …their proper consent. 

00:47:50
JUDITH MULCAHY And of course, why would they think there was any different to a lot of, particularly the most vulnerable children who tends to have many other services involved with them anyway… 

00:47:55
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

00:47:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …and used the information… 

00:47:55
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:47:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …sharing with other, yeah… 

00:48:00
PETER JENKINS Yeah, yeah. Although, again the research team suggests that where you have a counseling service within a school, that's well embedded, the children and young people begin to appreciate quite quickly… 

00:48:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:10
PETER JENKINS …the differences between disclosing to a teacher… 

00:48:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:15
PETER JENKINS …or member staff and disclosing to a counselor. 

00:48:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:15
PETER JENKINS And that they, they… they become quite savvy… 

00:48:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Fine tuned… 

00:48:20
PETER JENKINS …in terms of… 

00:48:20
JUDITH MULCAHY …to the differences, yeah. 

00:48:20
PETER JENKINS …of, of what you call tell… 

00:48:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:48:25
PETER JENKINS …to, to which person… 

00:48:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:25
PETER JENKINS …and the limits to which that information maybe put. And again, the suggestion very strongly is that particularly for, for young people, for adolescence that when they disclose, when they won't explore, perhaps family issues… 

00:48:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:40
PETER JENKINS …or painful experiences or whatever, that what is really important to them is a sense of having some control… 

00:48:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:45
PETER JENKINS …over that material… 

00:48:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:48:50
PETER JENKINS …and they judge this is in a very pragmatic way and… 

00:48:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:48:55
PETER JENKINS …so the risk is for, for counselors who don't manage these boundaries or aren't seem to manage boundaries in… 

00:49:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:49:00
PETER JENKINS …a very appropriate way that the counseling service may be seen like you only as a very leaky service… 

00:49:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. Hmm… hmm… 

00:49:05
PETER JENKINS …and young people may then be cautious about using it or about what they had prepared to disclose within that. 

00:49:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… Okay. 

00:49:15
PETER JENKINS So, because word gets around very quickly… 

00:49:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Of course, yes. 

00:49:15
PETER JENKINS …doesn’t it within schools… 

00:49:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:49:15
PETER JENKINS …in terms of well, I told this… 

00:49:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:49:20
PETER JENKINS …person and bang… 

00:49:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:49:20
PETER JENKINS …you know it was all round the staff room before you could… 

00:49:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Indeed. 

00:49:25
PETER JENKINS …sit down. 

00:49:25
JUDITH MULCAHY I wonder if you see any differences or any sort of specific issues around working with LAC children, looked after children. 

00:49:30
LAC Looked After Children 

00:49:35
PETER JENKINS Ah… 

00:49:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Thinking about you now we are quite often asked to go to reviews to write reports… 

00:49:40
PETER JENKINS Right. Yeah. 

00:49:40
JUDITH MULCAHY And again, other services finding quite difficult CAMS teams in particular… 

00:49:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… 

00:49:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Umm… to understand why we wouldn't write you know the same sort of reports as they were… 

00:49:45
PETER JENKINS Okay. 

00:49:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …and what, what if I any involvement to be having such review meeting. 

00:49:50
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm. I think maybe the issue would be less about the, the nature of the client, client groups… 

00:49:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:49:55
PETER JENKINS …in terms of well, this is a looked after child… 

00:50:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:00
PETER JENKINS …I supposed to a child who is, about the child in need or… 

00:50:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:05
PETER JENKINS …just the child who has come for counseling, but its more about the interface… 

00:50:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:10
PETER JENKINS …the tension between being part of a, a multi-disciplinary team… 

00:50:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:15
PETER JENKINS …and being a therapist with… within an agency contacts where your primary focus is the child or… 

00:50:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:50:25
PETER JENKINS …young person as a client because again experience seems to suggest that once counselors move into multi-disciplinary team setting where there is an expectation that information will be shared, the reports will be written… 

00:50:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:40
PETER JENKINS …umm and of course, this is crucial things like the common assessment framework… 

00:50:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, right. 

00:50:45
PETER JENKINS …and to child protection case conferences or the working of, of… 

00:50:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:50:50
CAMS Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services 

00:50:50
PETER JENKINS …CAMS Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services, but I think what is often not clear is what is the counselor's role within this… 

00:51:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:00
PETER JENKINS …they have this information because it's been disclosed to them by the child… 

00:51:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:05
PETER JENKINS …on what authority what moral authority do they then pass this information… 

00:51:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:51:10
PETER JENKINS …on to other professionals and what use will be made of it… 

00:51:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:15
PETER JENKINS I think the reality is in many cases, not a great deal is done with, but the information has been… 

00:51:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:20
PETER JENKINS …fed into this, this wider context… 

00:51:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:25
PETER JENKINS …and is now held by different agencies. Um, and we know that very often, there isn't necessarily a practical outcome to this… 

00:51:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:35
PETER JENKINS There may be no intervention, there may be no further action on… 

00:51:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:35
PETER JENKINS …the part of the agencies. So, I'm not sure what the best answer to this… 

00:51:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:45
PETER JENKINS …is because the pressures are there, the invitation is there for, for counselors, particularly school counselors to get more and more involved in multi-disciplinary… 

00:51:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:51:50
PETER JENKINS …team work and information sharing. 

00:51:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:51:55
PETER JENKINS But I think, we always have to remember that, we're only there because all our prior and primary commitment to the child or the young person as… 

00:52:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:52:05
PETER JENKINS …our client and not lose sight of that. 

00:52:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. And even being if, if you as a counselor are invited to a, a review meeting or any, any meeting of other services, even if the… the other services involved acknowledge your, your right to remain silent if you like… 

00:52:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:52:25
JUDITH MULCAHY …you're… you're still hearing other information and, and… 

00:52:25
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:52:25
JUDITH MULCAHY …of course therapeutically that's also very difficult, so… 

00:52:30
PETER JENKINS Yes, yes. Yeah. 

00:52:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …again it’s a two-way processes isn't it? 

00:52:30
PETER JENKINS Yeah, yes. Yeah. 

00:52:30
JUDITH MULCAHY And I think I would certainly, as… as a therapist I would always be sharing what I know with my client… 

00:52:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:52:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …so that there's you know, as far as possible we… we… we… we address the, the imbalance of power which is there anyway. 

00:52:45
PETER JENKINS Yes. Yeah. 

00:52:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Umm… 

00:52:45
PETER JENKINS Yeah. It just a difficult one because, I think a new model of counseling is emerging, so this perhaps idealized model that we've, we used in the past where it’s the therapist and the client and you have a… 

00:53:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:00
PETER JENKINS …protective therapeutic space, you do your work and your records are contained within that… 

00:53:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:05
PETER JENKINS …you liaise as little as possible… 

00:53:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:53:05
PETER JENKINS …with parents… 

00:53:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:53:10
PETER JENKINS …or other agencies and you do your… 

00:53:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:10
PETER JENKINS …therapeutic work and umm… 

00:53:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:10
PETER JENKINS …and work in that way. And we're now in a very different context… 

00:53:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:53:15
PETER JENKINS …I mean particularly with issues around child protection, safeguarding, information sharing, the expectation is that therapy is part of a treaded system of referrals, so its tear one or tear two within that, that kind of referral system, that therapists are called upon to be part of case conferences… 

00:53:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:53:40
PETER JENKINS …to as you say to report about the… the child situation to contribute to documents like the common assessment framework and so on. And I think there is a very real risk that the, the counselors actually pulled out of role… 

00:53:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Yeah. 

00:53:55
PETER JENKINS …because the argument then is well, if as a counselor, if this is the whole series of, of new activities that you're going to take on, then would it not be more accurate to call ourselves education social workers. 

00:54:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. It's an interesting turn. 

00:54:10
PETER JENKINS …rather than… well we used to… 

00:54:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:54:10
PETER JENKINS …have educational… 

00:54:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:54:15
PETER JENKINS …social workers… 

00:54:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:15
PETER JENKINS …umm… in many local authorities. 

00:54:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:15
PETER JENKINS And it's very clear to, to the child, to the parents, to the agency… 

00:54:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:20
PETER JENKINS …the young person discloses, then it's almost a conduit of information that then goes into a multi-agency setting… 

00:54:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:30
PETER JENKINS …and there, there is no… there's no tension… 

00:54:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

00:54:30
PETER JENKINS …if you like or much reduced tension… 

00:54:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:54:35
PETER JENKINS …in terms of well, I'm telling you this… 

00:54:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:54:35
PETER JENKINS …on the basis of my assessment review… 

00:54:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:35
PETER JENKINS …as a therapist you as a person and but that would perhaps be much greater… 

00:54:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:40
PETER JENKINS …greater clarity, the… the risk is that what we are calling counseling… 

00:54:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:45
PETER JENKINS …is in fact being stretched into a new and… 

00:54:50
JUDITH MULCAHY I think that's, that's a real… 

00:54:50
PETER JENKINS …unrecognizable role set if you like… 

00:54:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:54:55
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

00:54:55
JUDITH MULCAHY So Peter and a final question for you around the issue of confidential space… 

00:55:00
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:00
JUDITH MULCAHY What, what are the risks for or what might the risks be for a child, if a counselor does hold on to some information for a while rather than reported immediately. 

00:55:10
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… yeah. I think this is a, a very serious question to raise and the risk is clearly that a counselor may have information which is disclosed to them by a child or to be a young person because I guess, as a therapist you're making hopefully an informed risk assessment as you're processing the client's material. And it maybe that the, the threshold for reporting is lower for a child who by definition is more vulnerable… 

00:55:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:55:45
PETER JENKINS …than for a young person, but that's the risk is that the counselor decides to hold on to the information about the abuse that the young person is experiencing or risky behavior that they're involved in. 

00:56:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:05
PETER JENKINS And in order to protect the therapeutic alliance, they hold on to information which is crucial to protect the child from further harm or to prevent further harm actually happening to, happening to them. Its, it’s a very difficult… 

00:56:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:20
PETER JENKINS …situation… 

00:56:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:20
PETER JENKINS …to be in and I guess if I was wearing my social work hat, I would say that umm… that is not a call that the counselor should be making… 

00:56:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:30
PETER JENKINS …that, that information may well be the missing bit of the jigsaw… 

00:56:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:56:35
PETER JENKINS …as a counselor our perspective is very much with the individual client… 

00:56:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:40
PETER JENKINS …and what we're not are attune to is the wider social neighborhood… 

00:56:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:45
PETER JENKINS …or community perspective… 

00:56:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:56:45
PETER JENKINS …that what the child or young person is disclosing is about alleged perpetrator who is abusing multiple children… 

00:56:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Yeah. 

00:56:55
PETER JENKINS …and we know that abuse is often serial… 

00:57:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:00
PETER JENKINS …in nature it's often not confined… 

00:57:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:00
PETER JENKINS …to an individual child in a family setting… 

00:57:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:05
PETER JENKINS …or in a community setting. So, the risk is that the, the abuse is, is contained… 

00:57:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:10
PETER JENKINS …and is sealed over if you like… 

00:57:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:15
PETER JENKINS …and the, the child continues to be in an abusive… 

00:57:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:20
PETER JENKINS …situation. However, the alternative is that, if the counselor passes the information on without the child's active and willing consent, then there are risks of a different kind… 

00:57:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:35
PETER JENKINS …with child, that the child is swept into a child protection procedure, which they don't understand, which they don't agree with, perhaps which may have an uncertain outcomes. 

00:57:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:45
PETER JENKINS And at a certain point, they may simply retract, the disclosure. I think we, we need to find a better way of doing this that may sound a bit utopian but… 

00:57:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:57:55
PETER JENKINS …its interesting that there is a very lively discussion going on within the safeguarding industry if, if if you like, if I call it that which is, I think acknowledging the weaknesses of the current system which is almost approaching that of mandatory reporting clearly… 

00:58:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Yeah. 

00:58:15
PETER JENKINS …um… reporting child abuses is not a legal requirement in England or Wales umm… or Scotland. There is an argument that it, it maybe mandatory in Northern Ireland for, for very specific legal reasons, but… 

00:58:25
JUDITH MULCAHY And I suspect, Peter if I could just stop you there a moment, I suspect that will come as news to quite a lot of people. 

00:58:35
PETER JENKINS Right. 

00:58:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:58:35
PETER JENKINS I mean the, the legal situation very briefly is the obligation is on the local authority to investigate on the section 47 of the, The Children Act 1989, its not been changed by The Children Act 2004. What we have is a statutory system for reporting and investigating abuse… 

00:58:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

00:58:50
PETER JENKINS …and clearly if people, people work in the statutory sector, they will be the bound by the terms of working together and the, the statutory guidance and also by the, the contract of employment that they have… 

00:59:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. Hmm… hmm… 

00:59:05
PETER JENKINS …but there isn't, if you like an overarching obligation… 

00:59:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:59:05
PETER JENKINS …on us as citizens to report abuse. Umm… I mean I think people assume that there is, but maybe they are referring to United States where there is… 

00:59:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. Hmm… hmm… 

00:59:15
PETER JENKINS …a broader system of mandatory reporting. Mandatory reporting is not necessarily the most effective way… 

00:59:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

00:59:20
PETER JENKINS …of trying to combat… 

00:59:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Of protecting and in fact… 

00:59:25
PETER JENKINS …and eliminate… 

00:59:25
PETER JENKINS …or, or protecting children. And there's a very interesting discussion going on within safeguarding agencies, which is that given the expressed needs of young people to have some kind of control or say over what happens to their disclosures that's perhaps what we need isn't intermediary stage, so you have counseling while the young person discloses… 

00:59:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm. Hmm… hmm… 

00:59:55
PETER JENKINS …and rather than move very quickly into the counselor reporting to the designated teacher, they contact child protection team, child's social care whatever investigation… 

01:00:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:00:05
PETER JENKINS …then unfolds and the future of the therapy then becomes kind of really quite uncertain… 

01:00:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:00:10
PETER JENKINS …at that point. The argument is been made in, in a number of different ways say, its… its umm… there are cases reported on in Australia, Canada there's a safe doctor scheme in Belgium and the Netherlands, interestingly there are examples of this at work in the UK, in Scotland where you have a space where a young person makes a disclosure and the therapist works with that and it maybe that the safeguarding agencies are involved, but not with a view to launching a full scale investigation… 

01:00:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:00:50
PETER JENKINS …that there is… 

01:00:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Interesting. 

01:00:50
PETER JENKINS …there is a process of discussion and negotiation… 

01:00:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:00:55
PETER JENKINS …based on a very clear understanding that the, the young person's commitment and active involvement… 

01:01:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:00
PETER JENKINS …is crucial to following this through, in… into any kind of satisfactory… 

01:01:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:05
PETER JENKINS …conclusion. So, in a sense, you move from the therapy into… it’s still a boundary space, but the outcome is not necessarily going to be a formal… 

01:01:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:20
PETER JENKINS …report to a safeguarding agency, which would trigger an investigation and the argument you know, I mean interestingly is coming from the most unexpected… 

01:01:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:30
PETER JENKINS …court as the NSPCC in their evidence to the laming enquiry, the second report was making exactly this case… 

01:01:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Oh! 

01:01:40
PETER JENKINS …that it, it's surprising, its not… 

01:01:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Very surprising, yes… 

01:01:40
PETER JENKINS …its not a point of view that you would disassociate… 

01:01:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:45
PETER JENKINS …with the NSPCC, but they seem to have within this document a very clear understanding that to move from a disclosure within therapy to an automatic reporting… 

01:01:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:01:55
PETER JENKINS …and investigation system is not necessarily the best outcome, even in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Let alone in terms of the impact on the, the young person… 

01:02:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:05
PETER JENKINS …their relationship with the, the therapy with and with the therapist. And I think this is a very promising area because we have, we have a crisis within… 

01:02:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:02:20
PETER JENKINS …child protection and safeguarding. 

01:02:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:02:20
PETER JENKINS And it's based on a legal system which is adversarial, we have thresholds reporting… 

01:02:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:25
PETER JENKINS …again a recent report from the children society shows that for young people who disclose abuse, that the response of the safeguarding agencies is often very partial… 

01:02:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:02:40
PETER JENKINS …and is, is limited by their resources by their perception of the risk. So, it's not necessarily… 

01:02:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:45
PETER JENKINS …going to lead to, to positive outcomes if you like for… 

01:02:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:50
PETER JENKINS …the young person anyway that it needs to go through a whole serious of process. 

01:02:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:50
PETER JENKINS I think this is acknowledging that there are resource question within all of this… 

01:02:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:02:55
PETER JENKINS …and that in order to… my point of view is therapist to, to maintain and promote our reputation as a confidential service that this is the notion of therapy as a confidential space… 

01:03:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:10
PETER JENKINS …is something that we really need to look at very seriously. 

01:03:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Well, it sounds like a very interesting expiration… 

01:03:15
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …and certainly in terms of we were talking earlier about you know in the best interests of the child that it seems to be heart… 

01:03:20
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:20
JUDITH MULCAHY …of it rather than… 

01:03:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:25
JUDITH MULCAHY …and, and promoting during that holding time promoting and… 

01:03:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …and enhancing that the client’s strengths… 

01:03:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …to deal with… 

01:03:30
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:03:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …what’s likely to come next which… 

01:03:35
PETER JENKINS Yeah, sure. 

01:03:35
JUDITH MULCAHY …which seem like a very good idea. 

01:03:35
PETER JENKINS Yeah. I think it's interesting that this, this notion is not from, if you like counselors outside… 

01:03:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… hmm. 

01:03:40
PETER JENKINS …the system he was saying safeguarding is so, is not working, but this is an internal critique, this is coming from social workers and safeguarding agencies in a number of different countries… 

01:03:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:03:55
PETER JENKINS …where they’re saying our experience is that to, to try to hold that space to explore the disclosure to look at the options to avoid moving very quickly… 

01:04:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:04:05
PETER JENKINS …into a procedure which is based on information… 

01:04:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:04:10
PETER JENKINS …gathering, assessment… 

01:04:10
JUDITH MULCAHY And timing, yeah. 

01:04:10
PETER JENKINS …bringing, bringing, moving very quickly to a criminal prosecution if that’s one of the options on moving to social services intervention that we… we need, if you like to try to contain our own anxiety… 

01:04:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:04:25
PETER JENKINS …and to work with this and say what are the options? What does the child want? What does the family need in this situation? It might be a better outcome in, in this particular situation. 

01:04:35
JUDITH MULCAHY That’s really interesting. Okay, Peter we’ve looked some of the, most of the general themes here. 

01:04:40
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:04:40
JUDITH MULCAHY I wonder if you could look at some specific examples now… 

01:04:45
PETER JENKINS Okay. 

01:04:45
JUDITH MULCAHY We’ve got some sort of case scenarios which some of our counselors have put together for us. 

01:04:50
PETER JENKINS Sure. 

01:04:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Okay? 

01:04:50
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

01:04:50
JUDITH MULCAHY And so, I wonder if you could look at this first clip. 

01:04:55
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… Okay. 

01:04:55
NORMA JAMES I have a 14-year-old client at the moment and he is suffering from consistent very low moods after the loss of his brother to suicide. He’s asked for my help in making an appointment with his GP, because he is very, very worried, he is hearing his brother’s voice in his head all of the time. He doesn’t want his parents to know about the appointment. 

01:05:20
PETER JENKINS A very… very challenging case… 

01:05:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:05:20
PETER JENKINS …to work with as, as a therapist and, I mean what I take from this is, is that there are potential risk indicators in terms of perhaps the young person developing symptoms which might need some kind of, of psychiatric intervention really beyond what a therapist could competently offer. I think the scenario raises a number of issues about accessing psychiatric services… 

01:05:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:05:55
PETER JENKINS …and the… the role of the therapist within that, I mean I suppose it does assume that the therapist who is working with the young person is sufficiently skilled and competent to be able to, to perceive… 

01:06:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:06:05
PETER JENKINS …that there, there are risk issues here that this… 

01:06:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:10
PETER JENKINS …could be the beginnings of umm… psychotic symptoms, I mean I guess all of us hear voices in different way, so we would involve very… 

01:06:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:06:20
PETER JENKINS …sensitive expiration of that, but it's really for the therapist to began to think about, am I competent to work with this… 

01:06:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:06:25
PETER JENKINS …what is the risk to the, the child or the young person and how to perhaps help them to, to negotiate the transition to… 

01:06:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:35
PETER JENKINS …more specialized forms of… 

01:06:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:06:35
PETER JENKINS …of help. It's interesting that this report recently by Ian Kennedy on children within the national health service and he makes it very strong case, the children and young people to should be able to self refer into CAMS… 

01:06:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:06:50
PETER JENKINS And of course, what we have at the moment is very much kind of gate keeping system. So to access CAMS, really it needs to go through the GP or committee mental health team… 

01:07:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:05
PETER JENKINS …or you know appropriate source of that kind. 

01:07:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:05
PETER JENKINS And this, if that was available, if… if that applied within the local CAMS that this maybe one way for the young person to be able… 

01:07:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:07:15
PETER JENKINS …to get confidential help. 

01:07:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:15
PETER JENKINS Because again, I don’t think it follows automatically that the parents would need to be informed, they may need to be informed at some stage… 

01:07:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:25
PETER JENKINS …depending upon the nature of the risk. And, but the, the issue of being able to seek confidential treatment, being able to self refer… 

01:07:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:35
PETER JENKINS …in those issues apply strongly within the mental health field… 

01:07:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:07:40
PETER JENKINS …as they do within the education system. 

01:07:40
JUDITH MULCAHY But I guess it's a practical element to this as well, I mean I’ve been in the situation where… 

01:07:45
PETER JENKINS Okay. 

01:07:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …referred on to CAMS and, and you know the practical issues, a young person generally can’t get themselves on appointment on their own, generally speaking. 

01:07:50
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:07:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …so there has to be some form of parental involvement, but I guess in this case the, the client might have been able to take himself. 

01:08:00
PETER JENKINS Well, I take point about… 

01:08:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:08:05
PETER JENKINS …the transport or being able to access the service, I mean you would seen the pity that in principle access to a particular form of care, would actually depend from something as practical as, you know sort of perhaps some… 

01:08:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:08:15
PETER JENKINS …you know not being able to, to get a taxi or… 

01:08:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:20
PETER JENKINS …or bus fare or whatever and that makes the question as to whether or not CAMS services… 

01:08:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:08:25
PETER JENKINS …could be sighted in schools… 

01:08:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes. 

01:08:25
PETER JENKINS …running alongside… 

01:08:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:08:30
PETER JENKINS …the school counseling service in order to facilitate… 

01:08:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Interesting idea. Yeah, yeah. 

01:08:35
PETER JENKINS …this kind of self referral, I mean there is a wider… 

01:08:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:08:35
PETER JENKINS …debate in terms of what is the relationship between school counseling in CAMS and I think the fear is that school counseling would actually lead to more referrals and we know that CAMS really are quite struggling with provision particularly for the… for the age group around about 15, 16 and you know that, that they perhaps would be concerned, but being overloaded… 

01:09:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:09:00
PETER JENKINS …by referrals, but you could have a situation where as you have place for the school nurse, so… 

01:09:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes. 

01:09:05
PETER JENKINS …where you could have services running along side… 

01:09:05
JUDITH MULCAHY …along side each other. 

01:09:10
PETER JENKINS And a school counselor could refer or could assist… 

01:09:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:09:15
PETER JENKINS …the self referral of a young person to see a mental health work based in the school. 

01:09:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:09:20
PETER JENKINS And for that to be explored, again without necessarily the parents being informed at that point, not arguing that they would always be excluded… 

01:09:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:09:30
PETER JENKINS But… 

01:09:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Like at the most CAMS seems would have a, at the moment, as it currently stands would have quite an issue with that in my experience they always insist on parental… 

01:09:35
PETER JENKINS Well, it's interesting… 

01:09:40
JUDITH MULCAHY …approve it. 

01:09:40
PETER JENKINS …I mean again going back to professional cultures that’s within schools, I think that’s very limited understanding… 

01:09:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:09:50
PETER JENKINS …of the rights of children… 

01:09:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:09:50
PETER JENKINS …to privacy and confidentiality as under the Gillick principle. Interestingly within the mental health professional culture, there should be and I think probably there is a very well-developed understanding… 

01:10:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Right. 

01:10:00
PETER JENKINS …of the rights of children and young people to confidentiality. So, if you look for example with the Mental Health Act: Code Of Practice… 

01:10:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:10:10
PETER JENKINS …I mean there’s something like 21 different references to Gillick and a recognition that if young people are seeking counseling within that service that it's not automatic by any means, their parents are informed… 

01:10:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:10:20
PETER JENKINS …about this. 

01:10:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Alright. 

01:10:20
PETER JENKINS So, I think there is a leaver to argue that… 

01:10:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… Okay. 

01:10:25
PETER JENKINS …CAMS could be based within schools they could offer this, this referral or assessment if you like. And consistent with the policies within the Mental Health Act: Code Of Practice that, that would… 

01:10:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:10:40
PETER JENKINS …need to be confidential. 

01:10:40
JUDITH MULCAHY It sounds like an interesting idea, but it's… is it’s what strikes me is about… of the make school counseling different from any other type of therapeutic intervention in that… 

01:10:45
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:10:45
JUDITH MULCAHY …it's something that can be readily accessed easily by… 

01:10:50
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

01:10:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …by young people I supposed… 

01:10:50
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

01:10:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …to something that sighted… 

01:10:55
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

01:10:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …in a different place. 

01:10:55
PETER JENKINS Yeah. 

01:10:55
JUDITH MULCAHY So, yes. I’m just… 

01:10:55
PETER JENKINS Yeah. I… I think that is the huge strength of the… 

01:11:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:11:00
PETER JENKINS …school counseling… 

01:11:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Absolutely, yeah. 

01:11:00
PETER JENKINS …that, I mean it's easily accessible, it's non-stigmatizing, it’s free and… and the vast majority of children and people go to school… 

01:11:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:11:10
PETER JENKINS …so they can access it without having to make special arrangements or sort of go to particular agency or setting or whatever. 

01:11:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Okay. Thank you. Now, let’s have a look at this next clip. 

01:11:20
PETER JENKINS Okay. Right. 

01:11:25
MIKE SIMMONS Uh… I’ve got this 13-year-old disabled client who started seeing me for counseling without her parents knowing anything about it. And she told me not to seek parental consent because she doesn’t want her mother to worry. Now, at the last multi-agency meeting, which her parents do attend, the pastoral care manager from the client school, shared the fact that I am now working with this client. 

01:11:55
PETER JENKINS Okay. 

01:11:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:11:55
PETER JENKINS I mean again, I… I think its illustrates the, the difference between professional cultures in that as a therapist, one would be looking to protect that confidential space in working with the, the 14-year-old. And the pastoral care manager is working from a different framework, different paradigm, if you like which is an inclusive one, which is about… 

01:12:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:12:20
PETER JENKINS …links with parents, family oriented service and so on. So, clearly what we have here is a breach of confidentiality. 

01:12:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:12:30
PETER JENKINS And for the young person that may mean… 

01:12:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:12:35
PETER JENKINS …I mean one way it, there maybe some relief I suppose in that issue, the fact that they’re seeking counseling is now known to the parents and maybe that can be explored in a, in a different way. 

01:12:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:12:45
PETER JENKINS That would be a positive outcome. However, it maybe that the young person is very aggrieved and understandably distressed that what they held to be a private arrangement, a confidential… 

01:13:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:13:00
PETER JENKINS …counseling process, that confidentiality has been breached. And that’s, it's really for… I think the importance of confidentiality and the crucial necessarily of therapy to… 

01:13:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:13:15
PETER JENKINS …be seen to be confidential and needs to be understood by other professions that worked around it and we have quite a job as counselors, I think… 

01:13:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:13:25
PETER JENKINS …to get that message across because on the one hand schools are very keen to appreciate the benefits of counseling that, I mean by all the results show us that, it's appreciated by young people… 

01:13:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:13:40
PETER JENKINS …they value it and so on. But there are certain costs that go along with this… 

01:13:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:13:45
PETER JENKINS …and I think respect… 

01:13:45
JUDITH MULCAHY That they have to by into almost… 

01:13:45
PETER JENKINS …respecting the therapeutic… 

01:13:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:13:45
PETER JENKINS …frame and respecting that counselors work to a different ethical framework. 

01:13:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:13:55
PETER JENKINS It's interesting if you look at the code of ethics for teachers. Then that, it doesn’t say a great deal about confidentiality, remember… 

01:14:00
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

01:14:05
PETER JENKINS …the, I think it was a general teaching council from a few years ago, which may have been disbanded now, it said teachers respect confidentiality as is necessary. 

01:14:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:14:10
PETER JENKINS I mean that, you know what, what could you want… 

01:14:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, yes. 

01:14:15
PETER JENKINS …and that says it all, but whereas you compare that with to the extended discussions where confidentiality within the, the profession of counseling psychotherapy, it's a very complex area and other professions. 

01:14:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:14:25
PETER JENKINS I think if they want to, to work with this, they need to learn from us as much as we need to learn from them. 

01:14:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Two things to come up from that for me, one is the round question of privacy again and I know that here in Wales that, what the situation generally is as elite professional or link professional, I’m a teacher in, in but not necessarily teacher, but generally a teacher and generally someone in management as well… 

01:14:50
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:14:50
JUDITH MULCAHY …in each school who acts as a link between the counselor and the rest of the staff… 

01:14:55
PETER JENKINS Right. 

01:14:55
JUDITH MULCAHY …and began you know in terms of privacy, it’s very difficult for the school not to know who is accessing counseling because they need to… they have also… 

01:15:05
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:05
JUDITH MULCAHY …in local provinces responsibility to know where those children are during the school day. So, that there is an element which privacy is not possible totally… 

01:15:15
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:15
JUDITH MULCAHY …however, in this case obviously it's been you know taken outside of those boundaries. 

01:15:15
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

01:15:20
JUDITH MULCAHY And the other thing that, that caused(ph) me around is, it seems this particular child is disabled… 

01:15:25
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:25
JUDITH MULCAHY …and because I think there is a (inaudible ) culture around, you know the rights of, of, of a disabled child, not being the same as the rights for any other child… 

01:15:30
PETER JENKINS Right. 

01:15:30
JUDITH MULCAHY …I just wonder if you had anything to say about that. 

01:15:35
PETER JENKINS I hadn’t commented on that… 

01:15:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:15:35
PETER JENKINS …I mean partly, because I hadn’t seen a difference… 

01:15:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah, yeah. 

01:15:40
PETER JENKINS Simply because the, the child has a disability that they would… 

01:15:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Others might see a difference, yeah. 

01:15:40
PETER JENKINS …that they would be in anyway less entitled to confidentiality… 

01:15:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:45
PETER JENKINS …I think unless the child has learning disability… 

01:15:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:15:50
PETER JENKINS …which would impinge upon their level of understanding or… or communication or whatever, I mean the fact that this might be a child (inaudible ). 

01:16:01
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:16:01
PETER JENKINS …or and they may have visual impairment or whatever, I mean that in no way impacts upon their entitlement to… 

01:16:05
JUDITH MULCAHY No, indeed. 

01:16:05
PETER JENKINS …to confidentiality. I mean just going back to just what you were saying before, I mean at the… I think at an operational levels schools will say, well we need to know where children and people are. And, I think that again, that needs to be very carefully calibrated… 

01:16:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:16:25
PETER JENKINS …with young persons entitlement, confidentiality within the counseling process and it’s a case of well, who actually needs to know… 

01:16:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:16:35
PETER JENKINS …that this young person is receiving… 

01:16:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:16:35
PETER JENKINS …counseling and its possible I think to… to built firewalls if you like around that very sensitive… 

01:16:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:16:40
PETER JENKINS …information that the, the argument of schools and teachers been in local branches, is that I think quietly widely abused… 

01:16:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:16:50
PETER JENKINS …that if you want to look at the what the law has to say about this, their concept within local branches effectively ended in 1991 when the, The Children Act 1989 came into effect. And the duty on teachers is to take reasonable care that's the standard, if it ever comes to litigation… 

01:17:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:17:15
PETER JENKINS …then they have to act reasonably… 

01:17:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:17:20
PETER JENKINS …I mean I would have thought that there's a very strong case in terms of even within safeguarding a child protection responsibilities that maintaining high levels of confidentiality is taking reasonable care… 

01:17:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Yeah. 

01:17:30
PETER JENKINS …of children and people. 

01:17:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… Okay. And, now lets have a look at this final clip. 

01:17:35
PETER JENKINS Okay. Thanks. 

01:17:35
BLANKA HUBENA The parent of one my clients has contacted to school because they want to see their daughter’s counseling notes. The head of the school has approached me and I'm not so sure what to do. 

01:17:50
PETER JENKINS Okay. And, I mean it again, it maybe a situation where there is no conflict of interest between the child and the parents. And the, there maybe very little material in the counseling record, which in anyway would be problematic or… 

01:18:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:18:05
PETER JENKINS …and which the child or counselor would feel uneasy about disclosing. 

01:18:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:18:10
PETER JENKINS But I think we need to start from the recognition that the child's entitlement, confidentiality is our starting point, I mean that this is, this… this is the foundation and it maybe that the child doesn't not want this material disclosed, perhaps they’re responding to reconfiguration of the family, I mean perhaps sort of one parent who has changed partners or there's been a loss in the family and the child is, is grieving in a particular way, but others are grieving in different ways and they don't particularly want that to be disclosed because they're not ready for it, so they haven't yet processed it fully enough. So, with that acknowledgement that this is the child's material reflected in the counseling notes, then even within the Data Protection Act, which is remarkably kind of complex and Byzantine in its detail. It is possible to refuse the parent access to the counseling therapists note in the child's interests. 

01:19:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Right. 

01:19:15
PETER JENKINS And although in technically the parent has right of access to the education record and the counseling record as part of that, it would be possible to, to block that and because that if you like the, there's a conflict of interest between parent or potentially a conflict of interest between parent and child… 

01:19:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Okay. 

01:19:30
PETER JENKINS …having access to this. And again, I think the school personnel would need to understand why this might be so… 

01:19:40
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:19:40
PETER JENKINS …the risk is otherwise again its seen as a peculiarity of counseling that we do this very private, very secret work and we don't like to tell anyone about and it's all very mysterious and a bit precious, but I think that we understand and other professions need to appreciate and perhaps on the process of learning to appreciate that its because of the confidential nature of the work that we do that we can do therapy… 

01:20:10
JUDITH MULCAHY But its beneficial. 

01:20:10
PETER JENKINS …and within that process its because of the high levels of confidentiality that the disclosures are made. If you start to chip away at the confidentiality, you actually undermine the very basics of… 

01:20:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:20:20
PETER JENKINS …therapy in the first place. 

01:20:25
JUDITH MULCAHY And of course, thinking about (inaudible ) context and… and the Clarke report that's exactly where it comes back to, you know the fact that those, this children had nowhere to go (inaudible ) so there has to be a space for that to happen and you know that's brings us neatly back to the beginning of, of, of school counseling in Wales actually. 

01:20:45
PETER JENKINS Its, its… it is a very interesting point and it maybe a controversial response that, that I'm making, but on the one hand, I think the, the Clarke report and has had a massively positive effect in that, I understand £8 million has been invested on, in counseling schools in Wales, so it really is a beacon in terms of showing England what can be done… 

01:21:05
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:21:05
PETER JENKINS …I mean if in, in proportionate terms that would mean investment something like £60 million… 

01:21:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… 

01:21:10
PETER JENKINS …spent on school counseling in England and of course this is nowhere near that. 

01:21:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:21:15
PETER JENKINS Ah… and there's no prospect at the moment of government support for counseling in, in England anything like that what has been done in Wales. But I do have a slight reservation which is that, although out of the, the Clarke report, there was his recommendation for setting out confidential counseling within schools. Its very, very apparent that within Peter Clarke’s report that this was to be done within the context of safeguarding and I think that while in many ways that will be positive. Umm, I still would argue that there is an unresolved tension… 

01:21:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:21:55
PETER JENKINS …between the nature of confidentiality being offered to young people and this onus, this obligation to report and I don't think that is resolved within the Clarke report because… 

01:22:10
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:22:10
PETER JENKINS …it was trying to respond to a very particular situation of abuse… 

01:22:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. 

01:22:15
PETER JENKINS …involving the, the teacher… 

01:22:15
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:22:15
PETE JENKINS …who, who is concerned, and it was an appropriate response… 

01:22:20
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:22:20
PETER JENKINS …but I think there's a complexity here about how you manage, offering high levels of confidentiality, how you work with risk and risky behavior with young people… 

01:22:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:22:30
PETER JENKINS …and how on occasion you report as you must to the safeguarding authorities and I think that there is a lot more work that we need to do to try and get this right. 

01:22:40
JUDITH MULCAHY And I think as well (inaudible ) to the fact that, that and, and I think as the strategy has been rolled out in Wales its been seen quite clearly that its not just about or has not just become a, a disclosure vehicle and that its much more about the emotion at the gen… the general emotional well being in mental health… 

01:23:00
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:00
JUDITH MULCAHY …of, of young people. 

01:23:00
PETER JENKINS Yes. Yeah. 

01:23:00
JUDITH MULCAHY And because, you know otherwise we can, we can look too much at the… 

01:23:05
PETER JENKINS Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:05
JUDITH MULCAHY …safeguarding issues… 

01:23:05
PETER JENKINS Yes. Yeah. 

01:23:05
JUDITH MULCAHY …and see only as, as a disclosing vehicle. 

01:23:10
PETER JENKINS I think it comes back to the, the original starting point when we were talking about the, the concept of children's rights and within you and convention that the rights are very important, the admirable… 

01:23:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:25
PETER JENKINS …but they're set within a welfare frame… 

01:23:25
JUDITH MULCAHY Yeah. 

01:23:25
PETER JENKINS …there is, there is also provision for participation, which is… 

01:23:30
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes. Yeah. 

01:23:30
PETER JENKINS …again you know extremely valuable, but the notion of autonomy… 

01:23:35
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:35
PETER JENKINS …of the evolving capacities of the child of this provision for confidentiality is something which I think is slightly add odds with that and is, is not encompassed within the, the UN convention… 

01:23:45
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:45
PETER JENKINS And as counselors and therapists, I think that's where we need… 

01:23:50
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:50
PETER JENKINS …to keep pushing forward to bring that the, the attention of the… 

01:23:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Hmm… hmm… 

01:23:55
PETER JENKINS …the agencies and… 

01:23:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Yes, absolutely okay. 

01:23:55
PETER JENKINS …policymakers. 

01:23:55
JUDITH MULCAHY Well, it seems to bring us to the end of our discussion Peter, so… 

01:24:00
PETER JENKINS Thank you very much. 

01:24:00
JUDITH MULCAHY …thank you very much. Okay.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice, we give critiques of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples, in an informative, but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series, in common with all the material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you are a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that will have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
