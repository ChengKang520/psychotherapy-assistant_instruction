DANIEL J. SIEGEL Hello, everybody welcome. This is, ah, going to be a clinical demonstration. The, uhm, demonstration that I would like to do is around this notion of what, ah, Dr. Stephen Gilligan and I call archetypal energies, the, ah, basic frame work of this is that in order to create transformation change healing we need to be able to access and bring resources to whatever is the present state or the problem state. My particular background is in the area of Neuro-linguistic programming, ah, which basically you're saying that how we thing to the way we use language is, ah, very integrated with our nervous system it both accesses and triggers things in our nervous system as well as reflex what happening in our nervous system. And that process of psychotherapy involves using Neuro-linguistic processes in order to help people access the resources that they need to change. Uhm, the basic sort of formula for change of NLP if Neuro-linguistic programming is, if I take a present state or a problem state and I can add to that state or access, ah, during-- well, I mean that state the proper resources something will change. All right, something will transform and if those resources are the appropriate resources it will transform in a positive direction. Ah, this work that I do is the Stephen Gilligan, we like to call generative coaching in the idea of generative coaching is by being able, again to access resources, access proper resources. We are able to bring about the unpositive change in, in transformation. The notion of generative coaching is that very often we are going to then be transforming to be able to achieve something or do something that we have never done before. So, generative means creative, it's something new, something unprecedented. So, uhm, in our book on the Hero's Journey, ah, Stephen and I using that as a metaphor for that process of, of, uhm, again, positive change and of healing, uhm, we would say when we meet certain thresholds that is certain crisis point, certain key moments. We need access to, ah, the kind of fundamental resources and these are what we call archetypal energies. So, our archetypal energy means it is, ah, first of all we would say that any resources come from a certain quality of energy. So, do problems, ah, so, do, you know, all emotions or expression of a certain quality of energy, there's, ah, a somatic aspect. And the-- there are certain of these energies wouldn't we call them archetypal that means it's not something that you have to learn in your life. It's, ah, uhm, idea of an archetypal energies basically it comes with equipment, ah, you don't have to go to school to learn it. It's archetypal because it's built in. So, from the moment we are born we have certain resources. And that, ah, what we're gonna demonstrate here this morning is how to go about accessing and then engaging, ah, three of the major archetypal energies and those would be strength, ah, Stephen likes to call it fierceness, but I think, you know, power strength. Ah, the second one, is softness or we could call it tenderness, openness, receptivity. Ah, the third, is playfulness, humor, ah, some kind of lightness. So, first of all a-- we say this our archetypal energies because, again if you watch a baby, if you spend time with the child you will see them, they get hungry or they get hurt they're gonna express some of their strength or their fierceness. All right, they're gonna cry, you know. You don't have to teach it to them. All right. They don't necessarily model it for somebody else, it's, it's cri-- it's already there. But a baby will also have softness, right? It's going to cuddle in, it's gonna connect to part of its survival is based on being able to bond so, there is natural tenderness and we all if we've ever had the child you don't have to teach your child to have to, to play, right. To have a sense of humor, to be silly, to, you know, express joy. Now, in our view these three archetypal resources are a bit like primary colors, you know, red, yellow, blue. Ah, you can make all, all the other colors. You can make millions of colors from the various combinations of, of those primary colors. So, in a way you could say that red is like strength, right? Red is fears. Red is, you know, powerful. Blue is like softness, right. Soft it's open, it's tender. And yellow, is like playfulness, lightness. Ah, and, and so what we can do is by bringing these energies into our, our own nervous system and through our nervous system into our life situations, this serve as kind of filters for possible actions. So, these energies be-- will filter different possibilities, different quality of awareness. And then, ah, each of them has their own unique expression and then you combine them. And so, before I do the demonstration because this is relates to the what you'll be observing in, in the way I do the demonstration. Number one, is we can say then any archetypal energy is, is not and of itself, uhm, a-- it's, ah, as we say it's a resource but it is not always inherently express resourceful, yeah. So, you can take fierceness or strength and it can come out as-- in a resourceful way it can come out as determination, it can come out a strong boundaries. It can come out as courage. It can come out as focus but it could also come out as, you know, uhm, aggression. It can come out as violence. It can come out as, you know, something is harmful. So, one of the big questions is-- so these are e-- energetically an energy is not formed yet. All right, it is not in the final form and that same quality of energy can come out in a resourceful way, or it can come out in a harmful way. So, what makes the difference? And, and the work that Stephen and I do in generative coaching we say, what are the big differences is, is it coming from cent-- as-- a centered place, all right. So, am I-- e-- it is the-- this can happen with any archetype. We say, we will either direct that archetypal energy or we become it. So, if the energy takes over me, you ha-- and you see this with any kind of, ah, any sort of archetypal pattern. If I lose my individually into the archetypal pattern I just become the archetype. See this happening under, ah, challenging situations. It was very interesting, I remember reading couple of years ago, when they work having, uhm, the trials of the American, ah, guards that were at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq who had tortured these prisoners. They-- during the trials they would bring in witness after witness their lawyers are bringing witness after witness to say that these were not, you know, uhm, you know, ah, malevolent sadistic people that they were we-- as they grew up as children, they were a normal person. So, then you've got wonder how can a normal person act like a monster, you know. And it's because we lose our humanity to the archetype. So, if, if I lose my, my, ah, individuality to the archetype or warrior I just become a killer. If, I can stay centered and connected to myself, my uniqueness, my individuality then that energy informs me and I am able to use the energy rather than be use by it. And we could say the same thing with all of this other archetypal energies. If I get lost in the energy of softness I can become weak, dependent, you know, victim me. If I get lost in the energy of playfulness of humor I become superficial. You know, I become, ah, you know, uhm, ah, how do I say, you know, a-- again trite or, or, uhm, ah, basically se-- let's say silly. Whereas, if I can take that energy and directed it actually becomes a resource. Just one example, uhm, so a human that, ah, had been one of my training, ah, was a police officer, she's a police officer in Miami, which is, ah, not such, such an easy place to be a police officer and specially a female. And so she been learning some of these resources and, and practicing, you know, how to, you know, ah, direct this, this energies in her, in her professional work. And, ah, she was recounting a very interesting incident came back one time and said, yeah, she had this very-- it was very, uhm, profound experience for her where she had been called in to an incidents of domestic violence and, ah, she said, "Most people don't know it but actually domestic violence is where police officer is more likely to be killed or injured than any other type of situation." So more than murder or robbery. Generally, because in murder or robbery there is at least people are doing it with some premeditation. Right. There's some, the-- they there have their, their wits about them. Very often in domestic violence people have lost it, right. Their archetypes are taken over and they don't want anybody interfering and if you do interfere you become the lightning rod for all of that aggression. So, she said that she's walking up to the building. She can hear there's yelling and screaming coming from in the building. So, there's this kind of, you know, out of control fierceness, out of control, you know, ah, softness meaning, you know, there is this, this, ah, uhm, you know, uhm, sort of spiral going oin. And she is getting ladder and she gets closer to the house and then she is approaching to stair suddenly, you know, a television set comes crashing through the window and breaks on the ground next to her so things are really getting, you know, heavy in there. So, she runs up and she's pounding on the door and she suddenly hears a very enrage male from inside of the building say, you know, "Who the fuck is that?" And so, she takes a moment, centers herself, you know and, and suddenly notices out her peripheral vision the television set on the ground. So, she calls back in she says, "It's the television repair man." And sudden goes dead silent inside for about 30 seconds. And then the guy starts to laugh and comes to the door and she said she was able to defuse the situation without having to full her gun. Without having to handcuff. Without having to do hand to hand combat etcetera. The, so the point being a couple of things number one is that this notion of on the one hand or sometimes there is missing energy, you know, that, that you get hot in one of this archetypal energies and you get lost and you got stock. Uhm, so on the one hand there's a notion of being able to integrate them. So, unintegrated we say uncentered and unintegrated energies will always, you know, usually create a problem. It's uncentered and unintigrated. So, part of our goal also of this particular demonstrations we want to center each of these energies and then we want to integrate them and so this is the idea of then getting a mix of the colors. Ah, because-- and, and Stephen and I both, ah, experience this, ah, ah, very strongly in our personal interactions with Dr. Erickson. Erickson had tremendous, you know, eve-- even though if-- even though he was paralyzed and an older man he had tremendous fierceness. Ah, he was very, you know, very strong, you know, very could, could it be very stubborn along focus. But he also clearly had tremendous softness. All right, big heart, soft eyes, you know, big carrying. And of course, you know, he had a legendary sense of humor it's, ah, a lot of playfulness. And he use those-- I re-- I remember I use to sit outside of his office while I was waiting, you know, when we would go to visit there was clients that we-- ah, he would see privately so we didn't, we didn't, ah, we were not observing this sessions. I can remember sitting outside of his office and so he couldn't hear what any of the words that were going on but you could sort of here this energetic interaction. Some point he person might be crying and then they would be angry and they be laughing and then they be crying and, and you'd sort of hear this sort of, uhm, ah, how would I say symphony of this different energies until finally there was an integrated like in this notion of, ah, centered integrated expression of these energies. So, in the demonstration what we're gonna do is I like to the, the simple part of the demonstration would be we find a particular situation where there is some kind of stuck in this crisis, ah, with Stephen and Francine Shapiro and I were just in a panel talking about the notion of what we would-- what Stephen and I were call neuromuscular lock. That is-- it's a situation I-- in, uhm, sometimes the, the terminology I use for it is that a crash state we say that like can either be coach which is centered, open, alert, connected and able to hold what is happening. Or I'm crashed. I'm contracted, reactive, caught in some kind of an analysis paralysis. I'm separated, it's disconnected and I'm hurting or hating or hitting in someway. So crash state is where I'm in the kind of neuromuscular lock. And, ah, what we wanna do then is to say, "Well, how can we bring resources into that situation?" And, ah, this where some of the Neuro-linguistics will come in. Because what we want to do is we gonna access this archetypal energies but we wanna access their resourceful expression. I think the term resource is interesting, you know, re-source. Something is resourceful and it-- cuz, cuz it could be play. Could be a resource strength. Could be a resource even though they're really different context. But what makes them resource is we're-- they're sort of reconnecting us to a kind of a sources or center. So, one of the first thing we're gonna do is to demonstrate, okay how do we-- we're gonna sort to practice that little bit of centering and then I wanna access this archetypal energies. So, even though they're archetypal we have to find our Neuro-linguistic way to, to sort to flip the switch. All right. Where's the switch for my strength when I need it? So, by maybe in this situation, the problem situation I can't find my strength or I can only find that sort of contaminated version of it. Right. So, it's, it's coming out as rage instead of as, you know courage or determination. So, what we wanna do is find that and we're gonna explore this more or less four basic strategies for accessing resources. The first one is, is the most common one is reference experiences. We all have times in our life when we have had this centered integrated expressions of these energies. So, if I can find one of those reference experiences I can use memory in association to sort of bring it back. A second one is that we are equipped with mirror neurons they call them. So we can, ah, by role modeling others and the whole idea of mirror neurons is if I, if I'm around or even think about somebody else who has this, this expression, uhm, they say that in some parts of the brain up to, you know, between 10 to 30% of the neurons are mirror neurons so I begin to resonate with that, with that resource so that we can find role models. So, I can find my won reference experience or a role model. A third, is because they are archetypal, uhm, you have the whole, uhm, capacity for using symbols like the sort of, like Jungian symbols. Somebody thinks of, ah, my-- I know why-- where I, where I live near Santa Cruz big re-- you know, sequoias the red big tree if you think of a sequoias and it's starts to automatically engage the circuitry of it certain kind of strength. You know, certain kind of solidity. The fourth, strategy again, because these are archetypal is we simply act as if. So this notion of using e-- imagination to act as if I feel strong or I act as if, ah, I'm softer as if I'm playful. And as Milton Erickson use to say, "You can pretend anything and master it." So we can use imagination. We can use memory. We can use role models. We can use symbols. So, these are these four Neuro-linguistic strategies to get access to this resources that we would are always there. And the whole point because they're archetypal, because you're born with them no trauma can take them away, ah, and no, no life experience can extinguish them because they come with the equipment. Like they're in the, the, the DNA house of work. So, any-- everybody has them, you know, nobody can say, "I don't have that resource." You were born with them. So, we're born with this energy of strength. We're born with the energy of softness. We're born with the energy of playfulness. So the key is, ah, one will be able to get access to them and then bring, ah, of the proper expression so that's what I to demonstrate. To do that I'm going to-- I, I, I don't have a preplanned, uhm, demonstration person so we need a volunteer and then the volunteer will need to sort of sign over this. I see a lot of hands coming up over here. She's been already moving, all right you assist. Okay. Go ahead. There you go. Don't worry all of us-- by the way you'll all benefit. This kind of, this kind of demonstration I think you'll find that, uhm, we can, we can all sort of resonate with that. So, uhm, one of thing while we're getting ready, ah, as part of the thing that it demonstrate a little bit also how we work one of the common things that we or do using N-- NLP, you know Neuro-linguistic programming and instead of sitting in chairs-- we know there, there are parts where you will-- the NLP that is conversational but a lot of NLP is more interactive. And so we're actually rather than sitting we're gonna do the standing and we're gonna use a little bit of, of movement. There's a thing in NLP we call spacial sorting. Spacial sorting is a form of what is known as anchoring and we'll also be using anchoring, ah, in another way during the demonstration. Anchoring simply means you like to-- if you take the metaphor of an anchor it some kind of either, uhm, you know, a, a physical or a perceive-- perceived, uhm, part of our experience that becomes associated with some other part of our experience. So an, an anchor if you think of the metaphor an anchor holds a boat emplace so that it doesn't float away. So, ah, when I, when I first anchors is this notion of space we use-- we-- we're called spacial anchors. So we're gonna have one location that is gonna before what-- I was calling, you know, sort of the present state or the problem state. There's the problem situation. We're gonna use a different location to get access to the resources. And so, re-- resourceful state and a problem state and then we're going to bring the resourceful state. We call this an NLP mapping across we bring the resource into the problem state. So, you please feel free to coming up. Hi, nice to meet and your name is? 

00:22:10
SHERRY Sherry(ph). 

00:22:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Sherry(ph). Okay, so, Sherry(ph) wonder if you join me here, that's okay. 

00:22:15
SHERRY Okay. 

00:22:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL And I thank you for your-- thank you. This is, is another form of anchoring in that way. So, uhm, so, so Sherry(ph) thank you for your, your volunteering. Before we start I was just explaining, you know, I see this, it's like. That's it, it is different being here that there. But I tell you what, what I've discover is this is the best seat in the house. This-- you have all the support from all this wonderful people. They're brooding for you. 

00:22:45
SHERRY It's my flower bed. 

00:22:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Your flower bed. Yeah. So, so, so Sherry(ph), uhm, before we start I was saying that we're, we're actually gonna be instead sitting we're just gonna be moving back and forth from where this gonna be sort of, uhm, a place for the challenging situation that you wanna work with. And then place where, where we're gonna explore this archetypal resources. And, and always like to before we begin, ah, in stepping into any of this kind of problem situation to just take a moment and then we talk about being center this idea of, of what I called the coach state being centered, open, alert, connected. Then I think it will be a good thing to do right now anyway. So, as we're standing here one of the things you might wanna do is just take a moment and, and you guys can join this by the way. It's-- I, I you-- I think you get a lot more out of watching a demonstration if you're in a coach state then in crash state, you know also. So, usually a good thing is, is you start by kinda feeling your feet against something solid like on the floor. And, and you just find your, your vertical access. From the vertical access just means that your, your spine is long but it's relaxed. And, and when we talk about being centered and, and even though I can see, you know, that there's a lot of, of a lot going on here, centering would mean that you just bring your tension very briefly usually to the belly center. And the belly is just below the navel, ah, and, and performance arts and martial artist. It's always a good idea to center before doing anything. The, the Japanese called it the "hara" and the Chinese say the, "tan t'ien". All right. So it's the center. And as you bring your awareness their and so this idea of resource kind of connect us to a source and breathing is good. And then sort of opening the chest, opening the heart, you know. As, as you stay centered and feeling the feet on the ground and then your vertical access. And then becoming alert, aware, awake in the head clear. As clear as you can, I mean I know, ah, ah, obviously that we're not asking for perfection here but just sort grounding ourselves and then connecting, connecting head heart, belly, feet. You can even sense the connection through the feet into the earth up to vertical access to the head, to the sky, the universe sort of just a sense of connecting into, ah, a larger self, a larger feel. And that kind of eventually create a state of a sort of readiness to, to begin. So, I and actually just like to have that very simple just the sort of just simple code that say it, "I'm ready", I'm ready. Are you read? 

00:25:50
SHERRY I'm ready. 

00:25:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Are you ready, Sherry(ph)? So, Sherry(ph), you were volunteering very-- you're very, uh, actively volunteering. 

00:25:55
SHERRY I as the biggest guest in here. 

00:26:00
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, so what is it be-- before we work on the resource part let's look at what is the, what is the challenge of the situation that you would like to work with? 

00:26:10
SHERRY Uhm... 

00:26:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Take your time and remember you can stay center. 

00:26:20
SHERRY I keep diving in - 

00:26:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:26:20
SHERRY - to trying to get nectar from a viper. 

00:26:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Ah-huh. So this is a rele-- ah, in a particular relationship and the metaphor is about trying to get nectar from a viper and you, and you keep diving in, right. 

00:26:35
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:26:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, so that means that somehow you sort... 

00:26:35
SHERRY Well, I want them to be a flower, like you. 

00:26:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Shou-- can you-- she's saying-- what she was saying is-- I-- can you hear me? Not even me. Maybe we turn it up just little. So what she was saying is I-- metaphor she was using I keep diving in and trying to get nectar from a viper. So she was-- e-- she was about a relationship where this I want, I want to have a sense of being in a garden that is being nurtured, being profiled but instead on getting this-- yeah, yeah. Harmed in some way. And, and what, what I understand is the part of problem is, ah, is that you keep going back. So you're, you're aware that there's, uhm, - 

00:27:20
SHERRY Yes. 

00:27:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - instead of you being able to put up a boundary or to say no or that's enough. 

00:27:25
SHERRY Yeah. And past denial. 

00:27:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Well, you-- you're not in, you know, that's a good news. 

00:27:25
SHERRY It's good. 

00:27:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. At least you're in denial anymore. So, uhm, so what we wanna first do in NLP we would say that the reason that, that's happening, right? Is that it's, it's a classic example of a Neuro-linguistic program. Ah, my programming is running me. I keep going back, uhm, - 

00:27:45
SHERRY To mom. 

00:27:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - even, ah, even though I don't want to. 

00:27:50
SHERRY Yes. 

00:27:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL It's like you're trying to get, trying to get back to mom - 

00:27:55
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:27:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - and, and so what we would saying NLP is that what we wanna first do is if, if I'm not aware of that-- how that program works. I'm aware-- first of all what Sherry(ph) was saying is at least I'm in denial, I'm aware of-- that the consequence of that programming is not helpful. That's a first thing. But the second thing is, I've got to become aware of the program all right because otherwise if I'm not aware of that program, the program runs me and that's what's happening right now still with Sherry(ph). Yeah. The program is running me. 

00:28:25
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:28:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So one of the first things we're going to do before we actually bring the resources we need to bring a little bit more awareness to the Neuro-linguistic program that is running that keeps you diving back into trying to get nectar from the viper. So, what we're gonna do-- and that, that is what I say we have this, this other location because we don't wanna mix the, you know, the resources and the problems state until we're ready to bring the resource there in and, and, ah, ah, a conscious aware way. And I don't necessarily mean cognitively analytical way, I mean with awareness. So, so Sherry(ph) first thing I'm gonna ask you to do and this will be probably, you know, the-- must be the challenging part but it will-- but the whole idea here is I'm gonna ask you for a moment to sort of step back into perhaps a recent time when you found yourself doing that and here's the important part here. Not because I want you to just re-traumatized or kinda get back into the same mind those thing but actually idea would be to short of re-experience it but with awareness. So that you're actually are aware of what's happening. Now in NLP the places we wanna bring awareness is either something I'm saying to myself it's obviously there will probably be feelings and maybe there will be inner images. They might be memories. They might be imagination. So it's just gonna be for a moment it's something you know very well this diving back in process but instead of just doing it we're going to sort of experience it with a little bit of additional awareness. 

00:30:05
SHERRY Okay. 

00:30:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Willing to do that? 

00:30:05
SHERRY Yeah. How far back do I go? Like and hour ago or like 20 years? 

00:30:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Well, it's good question. Good question. The interesting thing is-- interesting because it's so-- ah, the structure and the program is like you'd be the same. It's not always that significant - 

00:30:20
SHERRY Okay. 

00:30:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - you know, there's what you need to be aware of it, well it's the same program even if the-- that was 20 years ago or 20 minutes ago. So, what we really wanna do is, is to find just an example that is probably a clear with you. 

00:30:35
SHERRY Okay. 

00:30:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Is there one, one that can you think of something? 

00:30:35
SHERRY Yeah. I can just go back a few minutes. 

00:30:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Okay. A few minutes ago. Okay. So, so, that what we're gonna do is, ah, as you we're gonna sort of step here-- this is kind of our space for the resources and then we're gonna step into a place here where you're going to put yourself back into - 

00:30:55
SHERRY This morning. 

00:30:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - something that's go this morning. 

00:30:55
SHERRY Okay. 

00:30:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL And kind of we-- ah, as we'll say well actually when you get there I'll do a little bit more guiding of that. So when you're ready kind of you're gonna use your memory kind of stepping to that reference experience. 

00:31:10
SHERRY Okay. 

00:31:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Now, so now we move to this place so this is this idea of a special sorting and, Sherry(ph), you start to put yourself back there but we would say in NLP is see what you saw. Here what you heard. Feel what you felt. Especially, you know, especially cuz this is, ah, it's a complex thing going on there. But that whole process of where you realize, "Ah, I'm beginning to drive in. This is what I don't wanna do." So, as that's going on just really take your time as, ah, as, ah, now the NLP person one of the first things I notice was that I saw Sherry(ph) sort of looking up. That's often time some kind of visualizing and I don't know if that's, ah, of memory or it was sort, ah, something you were picturing at the time. What do you, what do you just aware of that goes on this situation? 

00:32:05
SHERRY When I know? 

00:32:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:32:05
SHERRY Uhm, well, this morning I, I put my phone Viper - 

00:32:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:32:10
SHERRY - ah, on the ledge while the spewing was happening - 

00:32:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So the spewing was happening. 

00:32:20
SHERRY - so I didn't wanna hear it anymore. 

00:32:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So that... 

00:32:20
SHERRY But it didn't hang up - 

00:32:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Sort interesting - 

00:32:25
SHERRY - but I don't wanna hear it. 

00:32:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - sort interesting by that time you're already having the-- so this is the notion, the metaphor the viper right the poison is coming. It's, it's verbal coming through the, the phone. In this case you were sort of making distance from it - 

00:32:40
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:32:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - you put it over there but you said, "I still didn't wanna let go." 

00:32:40
SHERRY I didn't let go - 

00:32:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL You didn't let it go. 

00:32:45
SHERRY - but I put it away - 

00:32:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:32:45
SHERRY - from me. 

00:32:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, so that was at least the first step. So, so, let's explore this, when you say, "I didn't want to", what did the-- what is that mean? Do you tell yourself this is an NLP thing, right? We-- we're always trying to say, "Do I see something? Do I hear it or say it to myself? Is it a feeling?" And if it's a feeling, "Where do I feel it?" So here again, the whole thing is-- Sherry(ph) knows this very well it's a repeating pattern dun-dun-dun. To make a difference in it we actually wanna bring a little bit of additional awareness to, "What am I doing while I'm doing that?" So why is it that you can-- we could start with, "Why didn't you hang up?" Was it, is that a feeling that's stop was it... 

00:33:30
SHERRY I want a viper to be a flower. 

00:33:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL And how do you want that? 

00:33:30
SHERRY I don't know. 

00:33:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Well, so that-- so right there already notice the, "I don't know", is saying, "That's a part of my programming I'm not aware of." Wouldn't it be nice to know how that happens. 

00:33:40
SHERRY Yes. 

00:33:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, let's just slow this down a little bit. You're going, "Okay, that's there. I in-- on one hand I know I, I could hang up, uhm, but somehow I don't want to." What does that mean? If you were to really just pay attention to sort of feeling. Now here again, you'll notice that you see Sherry(ph) looking up and I'm wondering do you-- when you do that do you have a, a mental image of anything? Or what do you experi-- quick and I, I also see that something we see that there's an emotion that becomes associated with that. What's going right there? And, and like I said I know this is, this like this is probably the tough part but it's, but it's very-- will be very important, it's very useful. So-- thank you. 

00:34:35
SHERRY My flowers. 

00:34:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. She's your-- you have flowers. So what happen... 

00:34:40
SHERRY I want him to stop hurting me. 

00:34:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Uh-hmm. And, and do you see something up there? Do-- like you said, "I wish-- I want him to stop hurting." So we-- turning is your two things, "I want him to stop hurting me but I want him something else." So, I'm kind of this conflict here. What is that, that is that, that stopping you from taking action? 

00:35:05
SHERRY The stock thing that - 

00:35:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:35:05
SHERRY - you talk about? 

00:35:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:35:05
SHERRY Uhm, and I keep examining it but until I truly... 

00:35:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Say a little bit more about that. So, so we have this term I'm examining it but intellectually. Does that mean that you talk to yourself about it? Do kind of analysing it? 

00:35:20
SHERRY I talk to myself. I journal myself. 

00:35:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Journal. 

00:35:25
SHERRY I look in to reflection I tell myself. Uhm, you know all the stuff you do - 

00:35:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:35:30
SHERRY - I draw the image. I see the - 

00:35:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL But... 

00:35:35
SHERRY - new me. 

00:35:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So you have the new you. 

00:35:35
SHERRY Positive self-reformations, all of it. 

00:35:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL But, what stops you? 

00:35:45
SHERRY I still don't know. I don't know. 

00:35:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So hold on right there. Cuz you keep kinda going to the same place. What is it that stops you just take at moment. Is this morning, is there-- I mean is there a feeling, you ware the feeling says, "No", is there something inside of you that says, "No"? 

00:36:00
SHERRY That doesn't hang up? That doesn't move away? 

00:36:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:05
SHERRY Uhm, wishful, hopeful about it? 

00:36:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Wishful, hopeful. So let's, so now we have examining journaling versus wishing and hoping. What is this wishing and hoping? How do you wish and how do you hope? Do you, do you a possible future if you tell yourself it could be okay? Do you have a feeling in the body? 

00:36:30
SHERRY Like they don't mean to do that? 

00:36:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Is that what-- is that part of it, saying they don't mean? 

00:36:35
SHERRY That's denial I can't have. 

00:36:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Well, if it's that's what's going on denial-- if denial is still there that's we often do, you know, on those moments take a trip to Egypt, you know, that on denial. Anyway, just-- sorry. A little lightness I didn't mean doing it. But, but with-- in that moment you go from not hanging up is it because, I, I don't wanna see something or do you see something? 

00:37:00
SHERRY I - 

00:37:00
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Just a little bit. 

00:37:00
SHERRY - I don't know. I don't wanna think that they're just a viper. 

00:37:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. That's-- so I don't wanna think they're just a viper? So what is going on? I mean I hear that's more of a question than, ah, and, uhm, and this is important by the way because what we're finding is and this where we gonna bring the resources. Ah, we wanna kind of pin point where we wanna bring the resources and what She-- Sherry(ph) saying is, "I don't quite know what's that program that kind of go-- going off unconsciously." We can see form the outside that there's kind of something that she keeps doing in that moment, right? It's, it's not random. Uhm, but we-- and, and it's-- by the way it's, it's not even completely necessary that you have com-- you know, all consciousness of it. But we wait-- really wanna do is in some way it's necessary to invite here that part of you and that, you know, that part of your programming that keeps you in the pattern because that's what you wanna-- that's the place that you really what work. Journaling isn't helping. 

00:38:00
SHERRY No. 

00:38:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Ah, arguing with yourself isn't helping. 

00:38:05
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:38:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Ah, so, so just take a moment and really put yourself back to this morning. You could have hang up but you didn't. And it wasn't just because you were, you were thinking something. You said there's some very deep thing about wishing and hoping. What is it that you really wish and hopeful? That keeps you going back or that keeps you diving back in? What is it that you wishing for? 

00:38:30
SHERRY Like you-- what I think - 

00:38:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:38:35
SHERRY - because I don't know if it's - 

00:38:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:38:35
SHERRY - just more intellectualizing but, you know, I want it-- I want in my parents to not do that. 

00:38:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. You're also wanted your parents to not be vipers. You want your parents to nurture you. When you-- cuz I notice that you keep looking there. Do you, do you see images of your parents? So that's important to know, that images of your parents emerge here. Even-- she says images of her parents emerge here, even though it's, it's, you know, not, not physically related that they're coming up in this kind of image. Anything else when you have that image do you feel anything, hear anything? 

00:39:15
SHERRY Taking it? 

00:39:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. And what is the taking it mean to you? 

00:39:15
SHERRY Just not being able to do anything there. 

00:39:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So there's a kind of helplessness about that too? It's a kind of wishing, feeling helpless. Anything else tha t you wish? And I-- we see that this is not just intellectualization because there's also the emotional affect you. 

00:39:35
SHERRY I just wanted them to not do that. So... 

00:39:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL It's very interesting. I want them to not do that. So, one of the interesting things that, that Sherry(ph) said a number of times is, "It's about them. I want them to be different and them to not do this and I'm wishing about them." Which is very different than, "I'm going to do something." 

00:39:55
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:39:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL All right. And, and but she also talk about helplessness. "I have to wish that they do something because I am not act to that. I can't do anything about it. And I'm not acting." 

00:40:10
SHERRY Yeah. I can get a masters degree in it but I still can't fix it. 

00:40:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL But I can't f-- yeah, I can't. It's amount time of fixing it's even just shifting it. 

00:40:15
SHERRY Shift ing it. Whatever. 

00:40:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Just doing something. Yeah. So, let's, let's just take a moment and one more time we're gonna bring our attention there because this is where we're gonna be brining in the resources. So, there's a certain place where you need this resources thing. And that, it something to do with this moment where you're, you're aware that it's not helping. This is not good for you. You're wishing and, and hoping that it was different but feeling helpless about it. And as a result you're not taking action. So you end up wishing rather than acting. 

00:40:55
SHERRY Like I'm stuck in the corner of my room. 

00:40:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL I'm stuck in the corner of my room. That's-- so that's very important. And-- now is that, ah, is that also a memory or an image is that it? 

00:41:05
SHERRY Oh, yeah. 

00:41:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So there's kind of like I'm back in the corner of my room again, that's what my parents were there and if-- this is, ah, it's, it's repeating. Okay. So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna leave that, so let's step away from that. Ah, here's the important things we're gonna say, okay, you just bed all this time. I just then all this time going into it and being aware of it now we're gonna say, let's just put that program out there. This is really important part of this, this yes I'm aware I have that program that's been operating along time in my life but, or, and I am much more than that. That is not all of me, that's important to know. I am more than my program. I'm more than my personal history. I am more than that. You know, I think that's an important thing to know. So take moment and we're gonna come back again now so instead of being in the, in the problem state we're gonna really come out to this resource state. And remember that grounding in the feet sort of the vertical access centering, open, alert because here you're not in the corner of your will, right? Here you're in the garden here you have support. Here you are bigger than that you are more than that. You know? And now, now we gonna begin what are three archetypal energies, what were gonna suggest is wouldn't it be great if in that place where you feel helpless, wishful, you know, hopeful it stuck that you could have the strength, the courage, the fierceness to act. We'll start with fierceness. We won't-- on-- only be and actually it's, it's important we, we need more than that but it would be nice to have it. It would be nice in that moment to have but-- and not in the way that goes, "Fuck you!" But in a way that is the sort of center that keeps you in your, you know, your larger self, right your strength. And I'm curious we're gonna-- we-- we're gonna now access it and then we're going to anchor this resource. So Sherry(ph), has there been times in your life, you know, maybe when you worn in the corner of that room and maybe it doesn't have to do with this particular kind of relationship. But where you had a sense of, of great courage meaning even though it was difficult moments you were able to ground in your strength. Though, I see you are - 

00:43:35
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:43:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - oh, yes. Ah-- ah, anything you wanna share would there be a moment you could share of time when you've had this, this grounded strength, this fierceness and courage? 

00:43:50
SHERRY Uhm, I can think of so many. 

00:43:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:43:55
SHERRY When I had my children. 

00:43:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. That's a good one. So, when you had your children and so even though it was a challenging situation you were able to... 

00:44:05
SHERRY I was on it. 

00:44:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. I see that. I'm on it, yeah, yeah. Now you can also and, and I'm just gonna invite you was you kinda have this time on it. You might also think of who are role models of people that you know that also have that quality that when you think of them e-- it resonates for you. 

00:44:25
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:44:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Anybody you can think of it's a good... 

00:44:30
SHERRY Grandma. 

00:44:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Your grandma. That's cool. All right. 

00:44:30
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:44:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So your grandma. The-- the third is a symbol for this. 

00:44:35
SHERRY A horse. 

00:44:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL A horse. And then, we also have the, you know, the idea of acting as if we usually and this, this will become our anchors. So you-- I, I notice you made this gesture. If you had-- yeah, if you had a gesture for your strength, right? I'm on it. So you got that. You got your horse. Your grandmother and you've got your reference experience with your kids. 

00:44:55
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:44:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So these are gonna become our anchors. Because, because in that situation I'm gonna need a lot of references that help me stay on it. All right. So what were gonna do now this is the mapping across part we have the resource. Now we wanna bring the resource into that situation. So, what we're gonna do here is you gonna go, "I'm on it Dude." And you're gonna come back into that exactly that same situation we can start with this morning and then we can even all the way back to, you now, the corner of the room when you were little but let's start with this morning. And you're gonna take that and step forward again. And-- but this time, "I'm on it. I got my horse. I remember when it's like my kids. You know, I'm-- I've got my, my grandmother, is also here." Now, now here's the question to for important questions. First, when you bring this here now you back to this morning same situation, ah, same person and the same telephone, same room, what is the different if you have your strength? What is the different inside of you if you have your strength? 

00:46:05
SHERRY I remember who I am. 

00:46:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL "I remember who I am." Yeah. How do you remember? What is that mean to remember who you are? 

00:46:10
SHERRY They don't care about that. 

00:46:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. So, how is-- when you're in this strength you go, "I remember who I am." Do-- how do you know that? Do you feel it? Do you see it or hear? 

00:46:25
SHERRY Ah, yeah. I think. 

00:46:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:46:25
SHERRY I feel it. 

00:46:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Where do you feel it most? There, that's important. Remember who I am. Now, that's the first question is what's different. The second question is what becomes possible now that you can remember who you are and you have your strength. What becomes possible in that same exact same situation? 

00:46:45
SHERRY Bye. 

00:46:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Pretty simple. Yeah. Good. So that's good, right? They notice what we're saying is what allows that I've, I've always, I always hold and it always that have that in NLP we say we already have the capability we need. Why don't we use them we forget we don't have our anchor to them. We don't have our switch so it's nice to know, "I can bring my which." Now it just as another exploration let's take this strength all the way to that corner of your room. "I know who I am. I'm not gonna forget. I'm not a little anymore." I mean it's very interesting thing if I could bring this resource and all of these experiences and my grandmother and my horse and I'm in that corner of my room. What becomes possible? 

00:47:35
SHERRY Oh, I could ride my horse out - 

00:47:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:47:40
SHERRY - my room. 

00:47:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. That's a good thing you do. 

00:47:40
SHERRY Or I could put my horse between me - 

00:47:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:47:45
SHERRY - and them. 

00:47:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:45
SHERRY And my grandmother would have something to say. 

00:47:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL My grandmother would have something to say about this, yeah. That's import-- so notice it's an interesting thing we, we say-- we, we bring this quality of energy. These, these kind of energies become a filter, right? They open, pass, release said, "I'm always been there. Always there." It's kinda like I only, ah, again we're-- the idea of filtering is I'm only aware of certain things but one of the things that these energies do is bloom I got this it is now becomes possible. Now, so that's one example, I think that's good to know you got that. 

00:48:20
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:48:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Now let's step back and we're gonna connect to the second energy which is softness, all right, carry compassion. And I think this is the one you probably can tell was one of the once where I think Sherry(ph) gets caught a little bit. So what we want is ground it, compassion, right? Ground it tenderness. And not only for others but also for yourself. So, what I'm gonna ask you to do here is can you, can you first we'll, start with reference experiences? Can you think of any times when you were able to have the sense of, of truly receptivity of ca-- caring and compassion and yet you weren't, you weren't dependent. You weren't, you know, ah, it wa-- it wasn't pulling you in. 

00:49:10
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:49:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL You were able to be caring and also... 

00:49:15
SHERRY I practice that everyday. 

00:49:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Everyday. Yeah. So, what is that life when you are in that state and, and what would be-- and, and again let's find your role model for that. Who's a good role model for somebody that has that kind of compassion but is also very... 

00:49:35
SHERRY My professor Dr. Logan(ph). 

00:49:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Dr. Logan(ph)? 

00:49:40
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:49:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So you got your grandmother now we got Dr. Logan(ph) on it. 

00:49:40
SHERRY He's almost to my grandfather, really. 

00:49:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL He's kind a grandfather for you. 

00:49:45
SHERRY Things like that. Things like that. 

00:49:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL And, and what would be your symbol for that, that energy? 

00:49:50
SHERRY Anchor. 

00:49:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Di-- it would be what? 

00:49:55
SHERRY Anchor. 

00:49:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL And anchor. Literally and anchor. 

00:49:55
SHERRY Yeah. Literally he's that's what-- that was his symbol so what can I say? 

00:50:00
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, we got a horse, so we got anchor, okay. Great. And, and what would be gesture. You know, so if this was, if this is strength what is an-- I see you've sort of you, you automatically doing this but what would be your, your acting as if I have this, really this quality of softness, tenderness? But it's very centered, it's very grounded, like this. 

00:50:25
SHERRY My hands. 

00:50:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So now, we're gonna say let's take this energy in-- first of all we'll take it back to this morning and then back to the corner of the room. But let's step forward and you're gonna bring that now and it's for yourself. It's for, it's for the other person on the phone too. But really bring that there and you've got your anchor and you've got Dr. Logan(ph) - 

00:50:45
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:50:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - and you got all that practice. And the first question remember? Is what's different inside of you when you bring this resource there this morning? What's different inside? 

00:51:05
SHERRY I don't have to listen. 

00:51:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Interesting. 

00:51:10
SHERRY Uhm, I just can't differentiate - 

00:51:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL But interesting. 

00:51:15
SHERRY - and let a viper be a viper. If it wants to be - 

00:51:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Interesting. 

00:51:20
SHERRY - that, it's not my, it's not according to me. 

00:51:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Part of the reason I think that's very profound is you can remember all the wishing was, "I just want them to be different. I want them to do this if they were just be this way." Just going a viper is a viper. Go like, you, you know, you don't wanna have a fox guard your chickens, you know. No matter how much journaling you does right there. It's kinda like, fox, is not the one to guard your chickens. All right. So, that's, that's-- okay, I mean like foxes but if I try to-- if I think, "Well, I wish you would guard my chickens", probably isn't gonna work. So, okay. So that, that interesting things is I can be compassionate and not be lost in it and not caught and I wish it. Now, what becomes possible when you can do that? What becomes possible in that situation in this morning? What else becomes possible to do let's say... 

00:52:15
SHERRY Oh, I can be me, still. 

00:52:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. And what is that mean? So... 

00:52:20
SHERRY I cannot be spinning. 

00:52:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Very important thing she just showed you the spinning and we talk about spire on. That's, that's a new-- another new awareness by the way. It's very important to be aware of that. But instead of this, right? Which is going on up here, what is, what's there instead of that? When-- in NLP by the way whenever-- ever somebody says, "I, I don't do this, or I stop doing this." We always say, "What are you doing" Instead because you don't just stop thinking you do something else instead. So what happens instead of the spinning? 

00:52:50
SHERRY Instead of the... 

00:52:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:52:50
GRACE COLLIER Is it, you know, the infinity sign? 

00:52:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:52:55
SHERRY Just kind of a flow. 

00:52:55
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Beautiful. Yeah. 

00:52:55
SHERRY Just like that. 

00:53:00
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, like this. Instead of this it's like this. 

00:53:00
SHERRY Yeah. Yeah. It's not perfect but it comes back to center all the time. 

00:53:05
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. You know what? I always like to say, I always say to all my clients from the very beginning, you know, you don't have to be perfect, remarkable is good enough. So, so, okay. So you have that-- ah, ah, and that seems like-- so, so we have now multiple other choices, right? There-- you know in the first part there's no choice, right? In the beginning of this is I always do the same thing. It happens over and over and over again it's happen all my life. It's interesting to know, "Hey, I've got different choices." Now, let's step back we're gonna bring our, our third choice here. And third choice, is playfulness. Which I-- and this is one of the things I learn very much from Erickson and like I said about this police officer it that profound power of humor. All right. of ple-- especially when things are serious taken really seriously can make it worst. Ah, so, so I'd like to invite you-- now we're gonna connect into our third resource which is time when you had, ah, maybe a sense of lightness, of joyfulness or, or playfulness, humor, ah, we-- but you were still center even if it was-- it could be maybe even it was a very serious situation but you didn't lose your humor. I have a, I have a feeling there's a lot of playfulness with you. I see the, I see the sparkle in your eye a lot, you know. 

00:54:30
SHERRY I would get together with my group - 

00:54:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:54:30
SHERRY - in graduate school and - 

00:54:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:54:30
SHERRY - we would always play and have a really good time. 

00:54:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Great. 

00:54:35
SHERRY When we were out of class we would have dinner and - 

00:54:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:54:40
SHERRY - have fun and... 

00:54:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So let's start there. Really start to kind of remember that and then remember we have our second access is a role models. Who could be your role model for somebody who's, who's-- I mean they're very grounded. They're very serious but they're also, they got a sense of humor. And by the way it may not be a person. You know, Stephen Gilligan likes to say, you know, one of his great, greatest guru his, his, his, ah, golden retriever Lucky. You know, cuz when, when things get really bad, you know, he says, "Lucky, what should I do?" And Lucky go, "Hah-hah-hah", "Breathe. Right. Ah, Lucky, you're so wise." So, you know. So I mean I-- ah, maybe it's your kids cuz I know my kids always great mentors for me, for that touching moment. So, who could be your role model for this? 

00:55:35
SHERRY I just get a lot resources from the group. So - 

00:55:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL From the group. 

00:55:40
SHERRY - I'm gonna go back to them - 

00:55:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Back to your group. 

00:55:40
SHERRY - because there's Nancy(ph) who is just, ah, kick in the pants and - 

00:55:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL All right. 

00:55:45
SHERRY - I can't stop thinking about here. 

00:55:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So Nacny(ph)-- ah, we've got Nancy(ph), we've got, you know, the Dr. Logan(ph) - 

00:55:50
SHERRY Uh-hmm. 

00:55:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - you got your grandmother. We're getting a team together here. All right. And then, what would be your symbol so you had your-- you had the horse and then anchor what's your symbol for this humor? 

00:56:00
SHERRY My gosh! Uhm, one of the members of the group we had to choose a symbol for the class - 

00:56:10
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:56:10
SHERRY - and she chose this naked lady sitting there and we just had the time for the whole semester laughing about her in her sense state naked. 

00:56:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Okay. 

00:56:20
SHERRY And she was a bit of a character kind of all over spinning. 

00:56:25
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yes, it's-- so... 

00:56:25
SHERRY So that makes me laugh, every time I think of all the jokes - 

00:56:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL All right. 

00:56:30
SHERRY - in that expensive thing naked lady. 

00:56:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So we've got, so we've got our, our horse and anchor and a naked lady. Okay. I-- that's quite, ah, that is also quite a team about it. And, and I notice you're making this gesture but what would be your gesture for your-- again it's a physical gesture is another form of anchor for this humor. 

00:56:50
SHERRY Yeah. Then just we're just hanging on having fun. 

00:56:50
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So, so now as we know we're gonna repeat what we did before. Let's take this into that situation. Same situation, same viper on the same phone, same this morning but you go, hmm, and you got Nancy(ph) there and your naked lady. The viper doesn't that, ah, she's there but, you know, you're hmm. What, what's different inside when you do that? 

00:57:15
SHERRY I don't know we just kinda laugh at him. 

00:57:20
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. And what becomes possible then? 

00:57:25
SHERRY Uhm, that this venom is not venomous anymore. 

00:57:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Wow! That the venom is not venomous anymore. Isn't that amazing what we can do, huh? What we can do it's like, "I've got my anti-venom. Hmm, naked lady." I mean that's pretty cool, ah. So, so now, now-- I know our time-- we had a last couple minutes here so let's step back. And the last part of this is we want it now remember we said these are, that's preprimary colors. We wanna be able to bring them all together like a rainbow or a tapestry and so that-- I, I've got my, all right, "I've got my, my strength. I've got my grandmother. I've got my horse. I've got my softness. I've got Dr. Logan(ph). I've got my anchor. I've got my playfulness. I've got my group of friends Nancy(ph) in particular. My naked lady. But now I can weave this together because, you know, we can be strongly soft. I can be softly playful." All right. Now, the way that we bring them all together of course is through something that is more than the archetypal energies which means it's something that is not archetypal. It's the thing that's me. And throughout this whole thing one of the things that you were talking about is it keeps coming back so I can be myself. This is that notion. Now we wanna connect into the source the centered where you can have all three of those. And anyone, and any, and, ah,-- you know, I could can be 20% playful 80% strong or it can be fifth-- you know, 50, 30, 20. The key is let's just find this last anchor for being in your source for just being you. And what would be your symbol for that? Your anchor for, "I'm just me and I have access to strength, softness, playfulness." 

00:59:25
SHERRY I only maybe nerdy of me but I see the cosmos - 

00:59:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL The cosmos. 

00:59:30
SHERRY - the universe - 

00:59:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:59:30
SHERRY - and all of its beauty and Chios all together. 

00:59:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what would be your gesture for that, for you? 

00:59:40
SHERRY Life is that. 

00:59:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Life like this. 

00:59:40
SHERRY Yeah. 

00:59:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL So it's all that. So our last part is we're gonna take in that cosmos is your horse, your anchor, your naked lady, you got Nancy(ph). You got your grandmother and you got Dr. Logan(ph) and you got you. And so, here what you're gonna do is stick that back into there that cosmos in that sense of, "I'm just me and have access to all of this resources." So when you ready you step back in and we start first with this morning and then we're-- we'll just in by going back taking all of these resources to the corner of that room. But first this morning. Have the cosmos with you. Dr. Logan(ph), Nancy(ph), my grandmother, my anchor, my horse. 

01:00:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL I just have to come back later not - 

01:00:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

01:00:40
SHERRY - do this and - 

01:00:40
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

01:00:40
SHERRY - let things be okay. 

01:00:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Because you've got your antivenom - 

01:00:45
SHERRY Yeah. 

01:00:45
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - and that's important to know. Let's put you back, ah, just in that corner of that room for a last I think we have a final minute here. If you could bring all of these back that cosmos. You didn't-- ah, I mean in some ways you didn't know Dr. Logan(ph) - 

01:01:00
SHERRY Yeah. 

01:01:00
DANIEL J. SIEGEL - yet. You didn't know Nancy(ph) yet. All right. But how you do then you can take all of that back to the corner of that room, your horse and your anchor. Your antivenom. 

01:01:15
SHERRY I just feel, uhm, like embracing. 

01:01:15
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Yeah. I see that. I see that that's good to know. So feel like I'm embracing and what becomes possible when you can embrace? 

01:01:30
SHERRY Lifting up. 

01:01:30
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. 

01:01:35
SHERRY And not being there anymore. 

01:01:35
DANIEL J. SIEGEL Yeah. Don't have to hold on to that. It don't have to be stuck there. Yeah. And if you're not there anymore where are you?
