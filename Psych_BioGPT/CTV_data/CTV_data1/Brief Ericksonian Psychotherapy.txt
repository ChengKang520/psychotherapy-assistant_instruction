JEFFREY ZEIG Testing. Okay, Steve. Testing. 

00:00:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Test, test. 

00:00:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great, well, good morning everyone. Good morning. 

00:00:40
MITRA Good morning. 

00:00:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yay. 

00:00:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good morning, good morning. 

00:00:45
JEFFREY ZEIG So… 

00:00:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good morning, good morning. 

00:00:45
JEFFREY ZEIG …this is my uh… alter unconscious or alter ego, alter unconscious, Stephen Gilligan, of course and this is a wonderful opportunity. We call this a master class, because it's completely experiential and our format here is very simple. I am going to do a session and uh… somebody volunteered already for the session and it's a clinical session. Somebody working on a problem in which they are stuck and would like to get assistance and then Stephen is going to comment on the session and then we will work back and forth and have some dialogue about our perspectives and then uh… we'll take a short break and then Stephen is going to see someone and somebody has volunteered to be Stephen's client and then I will comment. We'll have some discussion. We'll have plenty of time for question and answers. And this is a tradition that we have established in our conferences. The Erickson congress, the brief therapy conference, the evolution of psychotherapy conference and uh… it's been an incredible privilege for me, because I'm the mainstay, but then we rotate and Eric Polster(ph) has done this with me a couple of times and this is second time that Stephen and I have done this together and I've done it with Bill O hanlon and with Michael Yapko. And next year at the brief therapy conference in San Diego uh… Eric Polster(ph) has, is in the sequence, he's, he's next in the sequence. How old is Eric now? He's 90? 

00:02:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think he's 95. 

00:02:20
JEFFREY ZEIG 95. Unbelievable thing. 

00:02:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:20
JEFFREY ZEIG It's just beyond uh…, he's just so perceptive and uh… you know that champion could stop therapist, amazing uh… human being. 

00:02:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And a true gentleman. 

00:02:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, he was, yeah, and Stephen is very close to him, a friend so… So, okay so that's the idea and the juxtaposition here is that uh… I'm much more intentional. I think, about the orientations that I take when I do psychotherapy and uh… Stephen uh… more right hemisphere and umm… more moving with the flow. So I think, you'll see a wonderful juxtaposition of ways of working. 

00:03:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Remember those words. 

00:03:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, we'll se if they turn out true. 

00:03:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, we'll see. 

00:03:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Please. 

00:03:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN We'll see. Uh… as Erickson used to say, "I don't know, but I'm very curious to find out." Good morning everybody. 

00:03:25
MITRA Good morning. 

00:03:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN As the identified right hemisphere, I just wanted to uh… take just a couple of minutes and uh… begin with a poem. Umm… partly, I just like to begin with a poem partly to honor my Irish ancestors and partly to emphasize that really uh… therapy in general and trance work in particular, I think is primarily a poetic communication and by poetic, it doesn't mean that we have to have flowery, rhyming talk, but rather where you, we're looking to use language, to open a space beyond language. Umm… we want to include language, but the real creativity occurs when a space that is bigger than that begins to open. So we get outside of the language box, if you will. Good poetry as in, in all good art of course, that's what its purpose is. So the poem uh… brief poem I want to share with you is from Rilke and it's from his book of ours that he wrote at the ripe age of 21 and 22 years old. Uh… he was umm… living in with I think the German part of what is now the Czech Republic and he visited Russia and he had this just inspiration and within 36 days he wrote 21 poems, umm… and he wrote a lot of them sitting in this threadbare room umm… over which was a huge bell tower uh… as you hear and see in Europe and every hour on the hour, the bell tower rang and rather than saying shut up, he used it as uh… you see in the monastic traditions in both the east and the west to sort of ride the… and at the end of that… these poems would come and uh… it's love poems to God. You hear this first one, it's a beautiful awareness about creativity and I, I wanted to begin our day here, because to me that's what therapy is about. It's about creativity. It's not about diagnosing primarily. It's not about fixing problems, but helping the client create uh… a more fulfilling, rewarding uh… reality in their live. So, here is Rilke at the ripe age of 22, sitting in this room, listening to the bell and it awakens this awareness. He said, "The hour is striking so close above me, so clear, and so sharp that all of my senses ring with it. I can feel it now. There is a power in me, to grasp, and to give shape to my world. I know now that nothing has ever been real without my beholding it. All becoming as needed me, by looking ripens things and they come toward me to meet and to be met. My looking, ripen things." So may we use our eyes and our beings to ripen consciousness to a fully human form today. Okay, Jeff, that's me. 

00:07:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Super, beautiful, so good time to turn off cell phones. Okay we'll do one microphone check. 

00:07:15
MITRA Okay. 

00:07:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Good, you can hear me Mitra, you can hear me. All good. 

00:07:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:07:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. So how can I be of, of service to you? How can I help? 

00:07:30
MITRA Umm… a lot of energy. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY ZEIG A lot of energy. 

00:07:35
MITRA Umm… I wish I always called it energy. I call it anxiety. Umm… 

00:07:40
JEFFREY ZEIG You have the uh… strange sensation that I just wanted to uh… 

00:07:45
MITRA Yes, thank you. 

00:07:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:07:50
MITRA This is one symptom, but actually I was running here so I'm still cooling down. Umm… 

00:08:00
JEFFREY ZEIG That's a good way to be anxious to rush to get to some place. 

00:08:05
MITRA I didn't have to think, I just have to keep, I was actually keep looking at my watch. Umm… the anxiety is so much. Since last year umm… didn't work for seven months, because I had two knee replacement. 

00:08:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh boy. 

00:08:20
MITRA Yes. And when I went back to work, I could hardly work. And I saw umm… Ericksonian therapist umm… Joe in Philadelphia. And he helped me a lot realizing that… 

00:08:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, good man, Joe Dowling. 

00:08:40
MITRA Yes, he's wonderful. Umm…, he helped me to get out of that job which was kind of eating me up, kind of. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY ZEIG What was eating you up? 

00:08:50
MITRA The job. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY ZEIG The job. 

00:08:55
MITRA Yes. And uh… 

00:08:55
JEFFREY ZEIG So the knees, the job. 

00:08:55
MITRA Yes. And then I find a job in nursing home and try to start a private practice. 

00:09:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm having a little trouble understanding. 

00:09:05
MITRA Yes. 

00:09:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And partly that's my problem, because I have a hearing deficit. I'm wearing two hearing aids. 

00:09:10
MITRA Okay, okay. 

00:09:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And partly, it's my problem because one of my hearing aid batteries went out. 

00:09:15
MITRA Oh, I'm sorry. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Okay. 

00:09:20
MITRA Okay. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And part of the problem is that the, that the speakers are going towards the audience, so uh… umm… we'll try to accommodate without changing the hearing battery but… 

00:09:30
MITRA Okay. 

00:09:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Slow down just a little bit so that I can better understand. 

00:09:35
MITRA Okay. So it was the knee replacement, changed the job, get another job, thinking about private practice and I froze. I just… 

00:09:50
JEFFREY ZEIG It's like… all these things being thrown at you. 

00:09:55
MITRA Yes. And the part with anxiety that really bothers me is not only the physical symptoms, is that I lost my compassion. Because I'm so preoccupied with me that I'm not giving like I used to and that's, it's really bothering me. 

00:10:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And giving is something that defines who you are. 

00:10:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And suddenly, your world, because of… your world… 

00:10:25
MITRA Pretty much. 

00:10:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Your world shrunk down. 

00:10:25
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh! And you started to do something like this. 

00:10:30
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And they were some pretty scary things. 

00:10:30
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Like not being able to walk and some uncomfortable things like the job isn't working. 

00:10:40
MITRA Right. 

00:10:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And so, it's as if you lost your center. 

00:10:45
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And what you're wanting to do is to return to who you know yourself to be. 

00:10:50
MITRA Yes. 

00:10:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so help me to understand what, where it is that you want to get to and how it is that you are dealing with the adversities, the challenges, the difficulties of your life and now what you want to do is to return into your home body and be once again who you know yourself to be. 

00:11:20
MITRA Yes. 

00:11:20
JEFFREY ZEIG How are you doing on that journey like if this is where you were at your lowest point and this is where you are, where you're being Mitra (ph.), one of those things being compassionate, show me where you are right now? 

00:11:30
MITRA Umm… between. 

00:11:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Here, here is where you were at your lowest point and here you are back to yourself. 

00:11:40
MITRA Yeah, I'm right there. 

00:11:45
JEFFREY ZEIG You've done well. A little bit more than halfway. 

00:11:45
MITRA Yes. 

00:11:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah and how have you done that? You've seen Joe, that's one thing that helps. 

00:11:55
MITRA Yes. Umm… Joe helps a lot. Changing the job helped a lot and I start meditating. 

00:12:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And meditating. 

00:12:00
MITRA Yes. 

00:12:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, yeah and this shows in when you're taking time to send to yourself, come back into your home body, then you may have more ability to give Mitra (ph.) energy, compassionately to the people who you love to give. Great, so and what's your uh… next step? How do you… 

00:12:30
MITRA I don't know. That's the, that's why I'm here. I don't know what's my next step Umm… there was part of me that wanted to have the private practice. 

00:12:45
JEFFREY ZEIG That wanted to have… 

00:12:50
MITRA Private practice And it's, I'm not making any movement. I'm stuck. Umm… and if I'm not giving, if I'm not having the compassion, I used to have and it's my umm… other talk inside me is negative, I, I just don't know how to get there. 

00:13:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh! So, if the talk inside you is negative… 

00:13:20
MITRA Yes. 

00:13:25
JEFFREY ZEIG …that uh… can certainly lead you into staying here rather than moving forward. So, one of the things that you're intelligently suggesting to yourself is that this could be kind to Mitra (ph.)… 

00:13:40
MITRA Yes. 

00:13:40
JEFFREY ZEIG …Day, week, month. Uh… help me to understand a tone. What's a pleasing tone to you? La… ahh… what's a pleasing tone? 

00:14:00
MITRA La…, that's nice. 

00:14:05
JEFFREY ZEIG La… like that. La… Okay and now imagine you quietly inside yourself, talking to yourself uh-huh and you're saying things to yourself like, you, you… hit a bottom. 

00:14:20
MITRA Yes. 

00:14:20
JEFFREY ZEIG You had some difficult, social things, physical things and you have moved yourself forward, meditation, being one of those things and now, another step can be talking to yourself in the language of la… So talk to yourself a little bit, say something to yourself about how you're dealing with adversity and how you're moving yourself forward, waaaah. 

00:14:55
MITRA Waaaahhh. 

00:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Quietly, inside yourself, I'll give you… 

00:15:00
MITRA Okay, okay thank you. 

00:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And you say something to yourself about your progress and your recovery. 

00:15:05
MITRA Okay. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Waah… Waah… Waah… Waah… And then maybe a meditative sense of recognizing that Wah… Wah… can have a rhythm and that as you consciously end or unconsciously stay in that rhythm, there is a way in which, you… orient yourself. A way in which, allow yourself to look down inside yourself quietly and there is a way in which, you can piece, piece together things inside, inside the privacy of your mind. 

00:16:35
[sil.] 

00:16:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Then Mitra, what's that like? 

00:16:50
[sil.] 

00:16:55
MITRA Actually, when you were talking about piece, piecing things together, I was thinking, peace. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:17:05
MITRA So I think, it's peaceful. 

00:17:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And you were experiencing peace. 

00:17:10
MITRA Yes. 

00:17:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And there is a waah… rhythm to that. 

00:17:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:17:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. Now, was that something that was nice, something that was easy? 

00:17:25
MITRA Not very easy. 

00:17:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Something that you were doing that could be helping. You and tell me who else is there in your social system that helps you to get back into your home body? 

00:17:40
MITRA A social system, I have a very supportive husband. 

00:17:45
JEFFREY ZEIG You have a very supportive husband, fantastic. 

00:17:45
MITRA Yes. 

00:17:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, and so he's been helping you in recognizing that it's really important. 

00:17:50
MITRA Yes. 

00:17:50
JEFFREY ZEIG For you to come back into your home body. 

00:17:55
MITRA Yes. 

00:17:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm, you know, I'm writing this auto, this biography of Dr. Erikson now, right and uh… it reminded me of theme in his life and when I was in high school in order to graduate from high school, I had to write an essay, all of the high school kids in New York had to write an essay at that time in order to graduate and they gave us a theme and the theme was adversity is the test of a strong person. And I don't even know if when I was 17 years old, I fully got the concept but I was able to piece together an essay and that when I think about some of the roughage of life, because Dr. Erickson used to say that every diet requires roughage. 

00:18:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mm-hmm! 

00:18:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And dealing adequately with the roughage of life is the real joy of living. 

00:19:00
MITRA Yeah. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So, help me to experience and I'd like to experience it physically. 

00:19:10
MITRA Okay. 

00:19:10
JEFFREY ZEIG I'd like to experience physically what it's like for you to be compassionate to be back into your home body, to be here again. Right, So I'm gonna stand up and I'm gonna ask you to uh… be a sculptress and you're going to sculpt me into a representation of what it is that you want to accomplish. How it is that you want to be? Look, what that would be like as a sculptor? You back and you're here now. 

00:19:50
MITRA Okay. Umm… I think my posture is… 

00:19:55
JEFFREY ZEIG As it has been. 

00:19:55
MITRA Folding. 

00:19:55
JEFFREY ZEIG How is it that you want to be? 

00:20:00
MITRA I want to be open, open my heart. 

00:20:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, okay, watch me. So open is this like an open posture. 

00:20:05
MITRA Yeah, I feel like my chest needs to open up. 

00:20:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So I'm being you for a moment. I want you to get a vision of where it is that you want to be and I want to get the felt sense of where it is of where you want to be. 

00:20:20
MITRA Yeah. 

00:20:20
JEFFREY ZEIG We could say back into your home body, back to being yourself. Uh-huh, so I'm, I open my chest. That's, that's big. That I'm you know, because when things are, there might be a tendency. 

00:20:40
MITRA Yes. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, okay so now I'm standing up and I'm into, and my chest is open and I've got a little smile, a little glint in my eyes. 

00:20:50
MITRA You naturally have that posture, so… I, I don't want to exaggerate. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:21:00
MITRA But, it, it was me, I need to kind of really open up. But you naturally have it, so. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, okay so being open. 

00:21:05
MITRA Yes. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And as I'm open in my posture, uh… I get a little glint in my eyes, a little smile. 

00:21:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:21:15
JEFFREY ZEIG It becomes very easy for me to breathe. I can move freely. There is a sense that I have of being stable, a sense that I have of being at ease. The things are together, all of the parts, all of the pieces together. Yeah, and I am at ease. 

00:21:40
MITRA Exactly. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, uh-huh, and this is where it is that you want to be. Okay, let's switch for a moment. So that I can get visual and you can get the felt sense, quite over here. Uh… and uh… show me you being at ease. 

00:22:00
[sil.] 

00:22:05
MITRA Oh, so hard. 

00:22:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Perhaps, you can make an adjustment. May I suggest something? 

00:22:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:22:15
JEFFREY ZEIG That you move one of your feet just a few centimeters forward. 

00:22:20
MITRA Yeah. 

00:22:20
JEFFREY ZEIG How is that? 

00:22:20
MITRA Better. 

00:22:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Better. Okay, great. And then uh… I can make another suggestion that uh… perhaps you do something with your arms. You might try something like this or something like this or something like this. So that for a moment, yeah, okay. No, that doesn't seem right. Okay, so try… Okay. Okay, yeah. They like that. 

00:22:55
MITRA Just like me. Well. 

00:22:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:22:55
MITRA Kind of. 

00:23:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And there is a way that you tilt your head, oh nice, how is that? 

00:23:00
MITRA That's better. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so then what you're doing is you're meditating on being at ease. uh-huh! 

00:23:10
MITRA Do I have to, have to… 

00:23:15
JEFFREY ZEIG No, you don't. 

00:23:15
MITRA It's very unnatural. 

00:23:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know what it is natural for you. Okay. 

00:23:20
MITRA Umm… or maybe, maybe I could do this. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, okay and hold it for a minute and feel it and play with it, adjust it. 

00:23:30
MITRA Yes. 

00:23:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And this is where it is that you want to be symbolically. 

00:23:35
MITRA Yes. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY ZEIG At ease. Okay, and could you maybe take your left arm and gesture from your heart, Aha and that would be a gesture that could symbolically represent you using your compassion… 

00:23:55
MITRA Oh yeah. 

00:23:55
JEFFREY ZEIG …to help other people because that's part of being at ease and part of being back into your home body. 

00:24:00
MITRA Yeah. 

00:24:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And you could perhaps imagine that your husband is right there and with you and behind you and that other support people like Joe were there, with you, behind you. And for a moment, I would invite you to take an easy breath and close your eyes. And get take a moment, take this moment for yourself, to go inside, wah… And to sense some of the rhythms, some of the tones of being at ease, waah… and that it may seem to you somehow as though, waah… somehow seems a bit more proximate, a bit closer. And it could even seem as if the rhythm of waah… somehow was being emanating from you, in your way, in your tones and that as you take an easy breath, you could allow some of the sense, some of the felt sense of being at ease and being yourself, again fully yourself, again, peacefully absorbed in the experience and that could even be a compassion, compulsion to return to this orientation… 

00:26:15
[sil.] 

00:26:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Of you being yourself again and just like as a little girl perhaps, you memorize roller skating, perhaps you memorize being on a bicycle. There is a moment in which you realize this is a visceral learning, this is something that I realize in the body of my experience. And it's not something that you do cognitively, consciously. Suddenly, you have the sense of balance and suddenly, you have the sense of momentum and suddenly, you have the sense of freedom of being able to move forward and embrace your dreams and go to the places to which you want to go. And I don't know just how you can begin to memorize and feel yourself somehow curiously compelled to memorize this orientation knowing that it can be a place to which you may want to, you may wish to return effortlessly, here and now and there and then and I don't know just how your inner mind can begin to use some of the ideas, some of the words, some of the images, some of the sensations and you can entrust the capacity of your inner mind. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
JEFFREY ZEIG To realize these things in your way and realize in your time and in the way that's really right for you and when you begin to know that you've got it, then I invite you to just take, take one or two or three easy breaths, take one or two or three easy breaths and bring yourself back here. 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And there is a moment that you know, yeah, nice smile and glint in your eyes and yeah, good sensation. 

00:28:55
MITRA Yes. 

00:29:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Really good. 

00:29:00
MITRA Yes, really. 

00:29:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's have you come back here. What was that like? 

00:29:10
MITRA I felt so different to be my body and umm… I felt a lot of heaviness like I was going to plant myself. 

00:29:20
JEFFREY ZEIG That's a nice sensation, uh… being planted. 

00:29:25
MITRA Yes, yes. Like before… 

00:29:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Planted. 

00:29:30
MITRA …like, yes. Like this and then finally, my whole feet was going to the earth. 

00:29:40
JEFFREY ZEIG So now uh… where would you say that we have moved things in from where you were to where it is that you want to be? Super, really super. It's fabulous. 

00:29:50
MITRA It's growing… 

00:29:55
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, I have a definition of health. Is it okay to take a moment to share it with you? 

00:30:00
MITRA Sure. 

00:30:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. That health is not staying free of illness. 

00:30:05
MITRA Yes. 

00:30:10
JEFFREY ZEIG That health is nice recovery. That health is the ability to recover quickly. If you judge yourself healthy, because you recuperate quickly, because everybody gets a cold, everybody has some kind of trauma that happens in their life and their health is their ability to recover quickly. 

00:30:35
MITRA Yes. 

00:30:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! And I know and firmly believe that you can give yourself in the privacy of your mind, talking to yourself kindly, quietly, some appreciation for how far you've come and also for your uh… courage in coming up here, because this is important and then you really want to get a little catalyst, a little boost that will help you. Mm-hmm! Right, and uh… doing that, could we give you uh… credit for extending some compassion to other people? Because, in this process, they maybe able to identify some of the ways in which they have? 

00:31:30
MITRA Yes. 

00:31:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And that there could be some sense of this that could, we could bring to the surface, that's also part of… Great, okay so now umm… help me to understand. Are we accomplishing what it is that you've set out for yourself? 

00:31:55
MITRA Umm… I can't put words in it, but it's something that happened to my body which feels like, it's free again and the language kind of from cannot is turning to I could, I can. 

00:32:20
JEFFREY ZEIG I can. 

00:32:20
MITRA Yes. 

00:32:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, okay so let's play with that for a minute and uh… imagine that against the background of waah… and that you quietly go inside yourself and waah…, I can. Of course, I can. I can, I am, I am. 

00:32:55
[sil.] 

00:33:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And that as you allow yourself a moment of simply human being that simply being human, I am Mitra(ph.) z 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:45
JEFFREY ZEIG I am Mitra. I am Mitra. I am Mitra. And that you can play with the tone… and play with the tempo and the emphasis and enjoy, enjoy fully being yourself, certainly yourself, absorbed and you experience and you may notice that as you do that, somehow it can seem as though sounds change and sounds seem different and it can seem as though the sensations in your body, in your arms, your legs, seem different. And somehow even the support, the pressure of your body being supported by the chair seems different. 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:35:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And that can be interesting and that can somehow help to add a little more sense of being yourself a bit more. And Mitra, what's happening now as you smile and what are you experiencing now? 

00:35:25
MITRA It's something I'm not familiar with is very good. 

00:35:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Very good. 

00:35:30
MITRA Yeah. 

00:35:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Something that you, is so very good that you can be even more familiar with it. Mm-hmm! 

00:35:35
MITRA Hopefully. 

00:35:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. A little chuckle to understand. 

00:35:40
MITRA Yeah. 

00:35:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And realize and absorb and remember. 

00:35:50
MITRA Yes. 

00:35:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, you, you uh… you have quite a chin, you've taken some difficult jobs over the past period of time and you're well on your way to get in where it is that you want to be. Okay, see what else is there? 

00:36:20
MITRA A some kind of sadness. 

00:36:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:36:25
MITRA Umm… not sure what it is. 

00:36:30
JEFFREY ZEIG It could be as many kinds of sadness. Compassionate sadness. 

00:36:35
MITRA It could be. 

00:36:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It could be a sadness of umm… kind of a way of grieving and saying that uh… you've been through something difficult. So many different kinds of sadness Let me uh… reverse in a little way and the sadness might be part of that. Let's say that you got the absolutely insane, completely crazy idea that you wanted to slow down your progress. You wanted to get in, in the way of your recovery. If you got the absolutely crazy idea of getting in the way of your recovery, how would you do it? 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:37:25
MITRA Recovery from… 

00:37:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So yes, uh-huh getting back into your home body, being who it is that you know yourself to be and you wanted to get in the way of that. You wanted to impede your… 

00:37:40
MITRA It would be by fear and… 

00:37:45
JEFFREY ZEIG How could you generate fear? 

00:37:50
MITRA Right now, I don't know. Right now, I don't know but it was very easy. Umm… not sure. 

00:38:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Something that you might want to play with. 

00:38:10
MITRA Yes. 

00:38:10
JEFFREY ZEIG That if you got the completely crazy idea that you wanted to impede your… What is it that you might do? And if you come up with some thoughts about that, some strategies for that, some ideas about that, might even write them and send them to me. I will keep them for you and I'll have them and I'll hold on to them. I'll be very gentle with them. I'll be loving with them and then if you ever need them, you call me and I'll give them back to you. 

00:38:50
MITRA Okay. 

00:38:55
JEFFREY ZEIG It's beautiful. Okay, uh… how are we doing about, about accomplishing what it is that you came here to accomplish? 

00:39:00
MITRA I feel such a lightness and I think I accomplish what I wanted. 

00:39:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, you really accomplished what you wanted. 

00:39:15
MITRA Yes. 

00:39:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Uh-huh and… that you can feel it and move it inside and have it in your body. 

00:39:20
MITRA Yes. 

00:39:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! And you don't have to necessarily categorize it or understand it in a very overtly uh… conscious way and yet it's something to which you can return. How would you imagine yourself returning to this orientation of lightness? 

00:39:40
MITRA Umm… I really love the tone that you had. 

00:39:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Waah… 

00:39:45
MITRA Waah… yeah, and I think I, I wanna add that to my meditation. 

00:39:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Wonderful. Yeah, I had the association of an orchestra and that before the conductor comes on stage and is consciously orienting all of the parts, all of the pieces of the orchestra, there is the oval and the oval plays a concert A, wah… and suddenly all of the pieces, all of the parts of the orchestra, wah… and that's a way of readying them to play. A little anchor, little orientation, it's time to play. 

00:40:35
MITRA Time to play. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
JEFFREY ZEIG As this been playing, we've been playing, yes. It's worth doing, it's worth doing playfully. 

00:40:55
MITRA Yes. 

00:40:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, I don't know that I have anything in particular to add at this moment. It's, if that's okay with you, that's a good stopping place, that's a good stopping place for me. 

00:41:05
MITRA Wonderful. 

00:41:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, can you stay here? Would that be okay? 

00:41:10
MITRA Sure. 

00:41:10
JEFFREY ZEIG You don't have to, if you prefer to… 

00:41:10
MITRA No, that's fine. 

00:41:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, that's super cool. Thank me today for… 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Their compassion can be there for you too. 

00:41:25
MITRA Yes, I take it. Thank you. 

00:41:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Super. 

00:41:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great you did pretty good. 

00:41:35
MITRA He did pretty good. 

00:41:40
JEFFREY ZEIG I couldn't have done it without her. I don't think you have to do anything with that, the stick, it's down, you're on? 

00:41:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

00:41:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:41:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. Umm… I'm really touched and to see… where you started in, in such a short period of time, the changes that you're willing to go through, you know, in this public setting, really umm… it give me good therapy and uh… and I needed. And uh… I could see when I need therapy, I'm gonna ask Jeff to be my therapist. 

00:42:20
JEFFREY ZEIG I'll be glad to ask you when I need that. 

00:42:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So I, I just wanted to say a few things uh… you know, to me umm… you can really see why this is called a master class umm… because that to me is nothing wasted uh… in such a uh… an elegant utilization of everything that was occurring and my own way of witnessing that is you know, when I sit down with somebody, I sort of imagine there is an arc of unfolding. You know, there is this person who on this life journey, if you will and every point on that journey, past, present and future contains possible resources and as Jeff said, sometimes on that journey, uh… we hit a rough, rough spell and it knocks us down and you know, this, this beautiful somatic model solve that how, how we get back to here. So you, you see, how in the beginning there was this limbic attunement which to me is so vital. Umm… so that, what, what is it? Is it… 

00:43:45
MITRA Mitra. 

00:43:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mitra. Where is that from? 

00:43:45
MITRA Iranian. 

00:43:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Iranian as in Persian. 

00:43:50
MITRA Yes, Persian. 

00:43:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great! Uh… so uh… Mitra of course, is in her state of suffering uh… and we want to immediately shift it from an isolated state where you can't really make any change to a place where one great American said, wherever two or more gather, name, was it George Bush? Wherever two or more are gathered umm… that's where all the good stuff happens. So to me, what was really impressive is, is how immediately Jeff did that non-verbal attunement and then what usually I think is so important is just listen very carefully, non-judgmentally to where the person is right now. You know, you really want to let a person know, I hear you, I, I get you, I sense where you are and where you want to go to. Once he did that, umm… I, you know, the vast majority of the session, I think you would agree was all about where is it that you're most looking to get to and what are the resources that you have available to make that journey and, and so umm… all of the trance stuff that regard was not primarily based on Jeff's content, but umm… it was really on… 

00:45:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Mitra. 

00:45:25
MITRA Mitra. 

00:45:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mitra. Sorry. 

00:45:25
MITRA It's okay. 

00:45:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mitra's uh… content. So uh… the sense of the connection with her husband umm… the uh… the somatic model that she had. Umm… her resource of meditation is that those all become the trance induction techniques if you will. Right, so every, every part to me, of, of the experiential movement is organized around things that the client is presenting. So, therapist is not having to think a brilliant techniques. The therapist is really listening to what are the core ways that the client is already using to touch the, the best of who they are. You know, and to me, I mean Jeff keeps his vivid sense, you want to get somewhere in your life and I love the support you're doing that and you have the resources in you to be able to do that. Right, to translate that into a reality, we can't just use words, this is the great gift of trance work to psychotherapy. We have to translate those ideas into experiential meanings. So I am, you know, particularly attentive to Jeff's musicality and to the way that his voice is being used, the resonance that is being used to really join you into draw out the spaces, so forth and so on, so that you can keep saying, I'm going here. I've already made as Jeff said, I've already made progress. There are still ways, I want to go. I have these resources. Let's just keep the conversation focused on how to be able to steadily move in that way. One other thing, I would come at time to, to my viewing is that the uh… the, the way that trance is used in this session, first of all, it's much like I have come to use it after 40 years, really in small chunks. So we're not trying to hit a home run with a trance. We've got maybe thinking of these five minute chunks and then after that we get feedback. That accomplishes a lot. First of all, the person can't get into too much trouble in a five minute chunk. Secondly, they're reporting to us all the things that they created during that five minute chunk which is what we need in order for our technique uh… to continue. And then thirdly, we want to uh… keep in mind that trance in of it itself is not sufficient for creativity. The unconscious umm… I think in contrast to the traditional idea, the unconscious is not creative in itself. Creativity is always a conversation between the two worlds. And so when we're using trance in small chunks, then we can come back and get the verbal cognitive to sense what's happening, to put it into context, to, to move it into the social world, so forth and then move on to the next chunk, right. Finally umm… I, what has become very prominent in my work is something that uh… we call regenerative change work somatic modeling. Uh… which is what would be a physical representation of the problem, of the goal, of the resource, all the key components of the therapeutic conversation can be represented verbally but they can also be represented somatically. The somatic representation is often a much clearer and simple, because you strip away all the verbal stories, all the meanings and you have it in a very stark way. So uh… that stuff, you know, when Jeff is inviting you to stand, to find what I would be calling somatic model for the resource state that you're moving towards the goal and then suggest a few try this, try this, try this. Then there is a, it was a really important part of that session. So, I uh… I thought it was great. It was, it was great to, to witness you on your therapeutic journey and it was great to witness you in terms of your way of supporting and so umm… I, I… 

00:50:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Super. Yeah. So let me uh… you know debrief myself and what I would differently next time if I were doing this? I think that what I would differently is I would smile more and uh… that umm… you know, what I remember Erickson or Betty Alice (ph.) or Roxy (ph.) uh… whenever they are, they are working they have this uh… really wonderful expectant smile and uh… I want to practice that more, I want to be with that more and it's uh…, it's of course, you can smile, of course, you can. Of course, you can change an expectance smile. So, I uh… after 40 years of uh… doing therapy then my orientation is, what are some of the embroidery? What are some of the "reminds" that I can add that increase the density just like a filmmaker or a poet would be wanting to take his medium and move his medium into an area where that medium had been before and explore the outer outreaches of that medium and to me, some of that is embroidery. How can you condense the communication? How can you do things would multiple levels? How can you do things with your posture and your gesture and your expression and the tone of your voice and the tempo of your voice and proximity? And adding these "remionds," because after 40 years, some of the basics of being empathic and being goal directed and establishing a good therapeutic relationship, those things now come very naturally to me. So then it's a matter of, of adding umm… little things that umm… will that would uh… increase the density of the communication in order to illicit in an even more profound way that one of the jobs of psychotherapy is to create a reference experience, a symbolic drama of change that by virtue of living this experience, you'll be different. And that requires me to get out of the chair and get the client out of the chair and think about this therapy room as a stage upon which a symbolic drama of change can be enacted and reference experiences can be put into place, there can be a re-association of ideas and memories and resources that uh… empower the person to feel that they have the courage and the confidence and the resources to take the next step that they want to in their life. Now, there are some of those things that are umm… really endemic to hypnosis that are not necessarily found in other schools of psychotherapy and one of those things is that we believe that people can change their state and that the changing state is central to hypnosis. You go from a non-hypnotic state, now you're in a hypnotic state and uh… so umm… when people get locked, stuck in unadaptive states, how can we use methods from hypnosis without necessarily doing a formal trance to help people to feel that they can flexibly move their state? Now, you can't do that cognitively. It's really futile to say to an adolescent, be responsible. Because, an adolescent knows being responsible and you want the adolescent to get into the state for being responsible. Now to get from the idea, be responsible to the concept that requires an experience and suddenly there is a conceptual reorientation and the idea which could be, I can do healthy things in life, I can uh… exercise, I can stop smoking, I can eat in a more healthy way. Well, you know, those things. You don't have to reinforce those in some traditional hypnotic way into the, into the client, but we need a moment in which the idea becomes a concept and the adolescent goes from responsibility as an idea to, "I can be responsible." And that I can be responsible can morph itself into a belief, I will be responsible and I will be responsible can morph itself into a state, a more adaptive state of being responsible which can morph itself into an identity. I'm a responsible person. But, the idea is there and the concept and the believe and the state and the identity, they come by virtue of the experiences that we live and not by virtue of the information that we receive. Now, conceptual communication is the purview of poetry, it's the purview of art, of all of the arts and it's the purview of lower mammal, lower animals. Animals communicate conceptually and if we want to do limbic resonance, if we want to reach into the brain and reach into the limbic system, we should use communication that is designed to be limbic communication and limbic communication is well birds communicate with sounds waah… and dogs communicate with gestures and we uh… know that if we want to reach deeper into the brain, that we can go back and rely on the kind of communication that reaches more limbic areas of the brain, because those seem to be the areas where people are stuck, that it's a very rough model, but then this encourages me to think what is the palate, what's the palate that we have and how can we use our palate? And that we have really done a disservice to ourselves and we haven't explored our palate. So… I was recently invited to participate in a, in a very prestigious project for a university library system was going to pay me, send me recording equipment, pay me to see a client make transcripts, put that in data bank, so students could umm… see, could read it. I was honored to be thought of so highly that I would be included in that project, but I declined, because so much of what I do is visual and tonal and I want to keep on exploring, how can I use posture and proximity and prosity, musical nature of voice and how can I use gestures and expressions and we have a tremendous palate and when I learn psychotherapy, it was my mouth to your ears and your mouth to my ears and we weren't using the palate that was available, the context, the umm… staging of your, of your room and it seemed to me that one of the subtexts of Erickson was that he was an explorer just like, you know, Picasso would have a uh… blue period and see what he could do with the color blue or a cubus period and see what he could do with uh… uh… cubic shapes to make simple percepts come alive. So, if we wanted to reach into uh… if we wanted to help people to reach the heart of their experience, that requires us to do things that are a little bit unusual and a little bit different, appeal to the eyes, appeal to the ears, make psychotherapy uh… a visual art, an art of movement and not just uh… the so rigid about my mouth to your ears and psycho educating people about all of the things that they need to know and creating experiential realities that help people to take the ideas that they already have and make them concepts, believes, states, and identities. So, that's my uh… proselytizing for Monday morning. And my, my thinking about what I was doing. So okay, so what would I add, well, I think, I would add smiling more and I would practice that and I would be doing that and practicing that more and then I would begin to have that happen unconsciously. I would add to think about it anymore and really… 

00:58:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you think that, like in, too much for a used car salesman? 

00:58:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Yeah. 

00:58:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The trance just for you. 

00:59:00
MITRA No actually, when you were smiling, it was very assuring to me. He, he sold the car. 

00:59:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great, yeah. 

00:59:10
JEFFREY ZEIG I have a bridge that I'd like to sell too. 

00:59:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN By, by the way there is one other brief point I wanted to make which is, if I remember maybe there, there was four brief, but meaningful trances during that and to, to my uh… eyes, Mitra initiated each one. Uh… so umm… umm… be curious about each of your comments. It wasn't like Jeff had a plot now, she's gonna go on to trance. But, we're offering all these experiential possible meanings and we're just curious as to which ones are going to most touch a person and trance is what happens naturally at the places that get touched the most and so at those places, Mitra just slowed down and tuned in and then Jeff just supported that. And I'm curious, your, your comment on that, your sense of in terms of what I was just saying. 

01:00:15
MITRA Umm… exactly, I, I think my work with umm… Joe in Philadelphia, I usually just go to trance umm… when I feel safe and that I know umm… the person who is working with me is supporting me. 

01:00:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

01:00:30
MITRA It's, it's some, I don't know how it comes but… 

01:00:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

01:00:35
MITRA And it's like, you and Joe never had to kind of do anything. Unusual for me to go to trance. 

01:00:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And following his lead, you, one of the nice thing that you can smile. 

01:00:50
MITRA That's true. I forgot to smiling, yeah. 

01:00:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Any, anything else that, that you would like to share, but you know, your part of the, the class of student in terms of just our learning today. What was most helpful for you, but what does seem to, to find most interesting about the session? 

01:01:15
MITRA Umm… that I have never been familiar with the semantic, umm… the, the semantic. 

01:01:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Somatic. 

01:01:20
MITRA Somatic and umm… it was very unusual for me to stand up. It felt umm… that I really could feel my body. 

01:01:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah! 

01:01:35
MITRA And I had not been able to do that for a long time. 

01:01:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

01:01:35
MITRA And uh… also when you use the tone umm… because I'm very, in my brain and with my symptoms and all, the things I was doing to my thought umm… the tune was like opening up, this phase which was closed for a long, long time. 

01:01:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. So the most important complex techniques that Jeff used was having you stand up and sing the note. Everything else, whatever. 

01:02:10
MITRA And he smiled. 

01:02:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's what I hear all the time and he smiled. 

01:02:15
JEFFREY ZEIG So, let's see and uh… we have a volunteer umm…, if you can help uh… take the microphone and see if somebody has reflections or comments or questions better to take those uh… to Stephen and I uh… rather than uh… directing them to Mitra. 

01:02:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah and, and if you don't mind uh… 

01:02:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Introduce yourself. 

01:02:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Stand up, it helps… 

01:02:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Introduce yourself. 

01:02:45
MITRA Okay, uh… I was wondering uh… how you came to the inside, to use that particular form of tone? 

01:02:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Umm… I was, I, I didn't have anything other than the intuition at that moment that umm… there would be a tone that could reflect an aspect of experience and that if you reduce things to words, you lose some of the poetry of the moment and if you make things metaphoric, literative, poetic or you make things physical or you make things symbolic that it has deeper resonance that uh… moving into the brain. So whether that was uh… is being inspired at the moment to think of a tone or a fragment of poetry or a metaphor or a story or a gesture, uh… I don't know that it would have really mattered very much and umm… maybe her thinking about meditation and me to thinking of meditative sounds for example in the Indian tradition, om as a meditative sound, maybe that led me to overlap to the, the tone that I used, but I, I really don't know it was just uh… trusting a baby thought and it was a baby thought that was there and that was something that I had talked about in another workshop was, was that Baedeker, Karl Baedeker who mentored me for family therapy would suggest to his residents, trust your baby thoughts. Say your baby thoughts. If you have a baby thought say the baby thought and whereas, when I was a novice therapist, I would mistrust my baby thoughts and I wouldn't say them and I would suppress them and maybe I come back to them later and the timing was wrong and that by virtue of launching then my confidence is that whatever response, I get, I'll find a way to utilize it. So if I know that I can find a way to utilize unreasonably secure, I can find a way to utilize it to advance the therapy, because I've got the goal in mind, then I might try a tone and see if that works and if it doesn't work, I try toy metaphor, if it doesn't work, a posture, a story or a gesture or some other symbolic expression that makes a simple idea come alive, yeah. Sir, introduce yourself. 

01:05:15
MITRA Yes. Ken Girn(ph) from San Diego. First of all, thank you for, for volunteer, that was beautiful and umm… yes, it is a master class, because that was incredibly masterful. I gave up trying to take notes, no good. Umm… but uh… Jeff aren't, in some ways this limbic and somatic uh… philosophy, isn't that returning to like an earlier time in psychotherapy, rolfing and other kinds of body and somatic things, but it's different in a way. So could you define the difference it seems like it's somewhere more conceptual, the client isn't doing as much but it is going back there. 

01:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. And going back uh… could be sculpting. That sculpting was something that (inaudible ) were doing in the 70s and they were doing family sculpting and what Lilian, my ex-wife and myself had been doing is therapist sculpting and client sculpting and we've, we've uh… been taking something that had uh… relevance in the past and, and reorganizing it in a more strategic way. And the more Ericksonian directed way. So yes, you know, when you think about the development of psychotherapy in the first 60 years being umm… shrouded in analytic thinking and then you had a wild divergence, of people trying different things. Primal scream and rolfing and uh… all of the different forms of therapy that maybe now in our adolescence, because psychotherapy is only about a 140 years old, 1885 when Freud first became interested in the psychological aspects of medicine. So now, we try to bring about a kind of convergence and age regression and what are the commonalities that make therapy successful rather than what happened in 85 in the evolution conference which were still Star Wars and people touting, you know, mine is bigger, better than yours. But now, some of the emphasis of the evolution conference is looking over the fences, tearing down the fences and thinking, you know, we, we do those things kind of similarly and what can we learn from you and what could you learn from us? So umm… you know, whereas rolfing was very specific in its orientation about using the body, the kind of generative body work that Stephen would be doing or the kind of sculpting that I might be doing. These are not the therapy. These are just integrated into the complex weave of the therapy whereas rolfing or you know, umm… rikean work were, were more specifically centered lower and more bioenergetics specifically centered around how do you use your body rather than uh… you know, just using a piece of that to integrate uh… that the, you know the complex weave and you know, thinking also, you know, I have this little umm… you know, (inaudible ) that sits on my shoulder and says, "okay, there has got to be an interactional solution in here somewhere. There has got to be something that refers to other people," like her husband just got to be some way in which there is an interactional solution and a little lower, you know that sits on my shoulder, okay, you know, this is a felt sense, this is a body experience or a little gendolin (ph.) that sits on my shoulder and says, what is the felt sense of, of your experience and a little Carl Rogers and that, you know, that orients me to empathy and so it's a matter of taking the umm… ways in which all of these master swam upstream and extracting some of the components that work for me and then integrating them into the, the weave of the uh… of the therapy. We stand on a lot of people shoulders and we're very lucky that we got to stand on their shoulders. 

01:09:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I would uh… just add that, I think the uh… cognitive somatic connection is one of the most interesting development in psychotherapy these days and we particularly see it in the trauma uh… in the field of trauma work. The one distinction that I would make is I think the early sort of Rikean bioenergetic and then like anger expression, they didn't appreciate the difference between forced muscularity and I have a Chinese wife, we talk about chi flow. So when the muscle, the voluntary muscles are locked, that's what is blocking any sort of creative process. So, it's not just somatic movement that it's a quality of somatic movement where you feel that the sort of the subtle or what generally is called the felt sense flowing through. Umm… and I think when you make that distinction, then you see how the somatic patterning can be one integral part of this overall creative journey. 

01:10:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's take one more comment and then we'll take a ten minute break and then we'll come, two more comments. One more, two more, okay, please, well yes, oh, two more Roxy. 

01:10:45
MITRA Erickson and I want to start by saying, thank you all three of you and to talk about a wealth of the resources we have up there on stage. Umm… when I have had umm… loved ones who I felt needed some therapeutic guidance, Jeff and Steve Gilligan are the first calls that I make. So, we have real wealth of resources on the stage and I want to comment that, that was a real seamless display of starting with conversation and moving into hypnotic trance in and out of hypnotic trance, strategically offering umm… suggestions and weaving together whole depth and multitude of possibilities, opening doors in every direction, following the lead of the subject. That was very, very beautifully done. There was a couple of specific ways that really stood out to me as being exceptionally eloquent and uh… I, I don't know if you want response on those specific techniques, but I do want to say that Mitra, when you expressed your cheap complaint which was the lack of passion, you expressed that concern with such depth of passion and it's, it's evidence that the healing process was all very well underway. So thank you for a beautiful, a beautiful demonstration. 

01:12:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much. 

01:12:40
[sil.] 

01:12:45
MITRA Thank you, my name is Joganori(ph) and I'm from uh… New Jersey, right out of Philadelphia, where Mitra is from. I really appreciate today and one of the things that uh… I noticed your use of when I deal with professionals a lot of times, they always try to tell me what it's all about. They get into the words of it. They get into the verbiage of it. But I think of Ray Whitsaw (ph.) at University of Pennsylvania, the anthropology and uh… kind of see his department, he says that words are very small part of the communication. He says 7%, but it could be 5% or whatever and then the tonality which you mentioned is almost of 3%, the difference between that two little words and the rest. And then the other 50 some percent it's a bomb. So we could, oh, it's the body. So we really could shut up and just mm… and a lot of the, a lot of the mmms… are international languages. I mean, if I go mmm, you get the gist of that and if I go uhh, it's, it's there and you go that out and I thought that was exciting. I've been jumping up and down in my seat. That's all I really want to share. 

01:14:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Just, just imagine what's gonna happen when he starts smiling. 

01:14:05
[sil.] 

01:14:10
LARRY Uh… I'm Larry. Uh… one observation I saw uh… I thought was very beautiful was that umm… when the session started, uh… Jeff, you umm…, you stayed in your space and didn't mirror her body or tonalities. But you then helped to assist as, as standing up when the experiential portion umm… and then I noticed when you sat back down the mirroring was just naturally there rather than setting something up, you know, in the sitting position first where you like matched her voice tone and matched her posture. You were very much was forward and she was a bit slumped and it just sort of emerged to the experiential, your sort of assistance in it, sort of a different order than sometimes maybe the earlier hypnosis model was or something like that. Can you relate to that? 

01:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I, I, I couldn't hear, because of my hearing deficit. And your tones are right in the range where I have trouble. But, what I was thinking about when in, in you know, the attunement like okay, that's like, what Stephen would call limbic resonance and so that comes first to attune yourself to the other person and get into synch with that person and uh… understand something about that person's experiential reality, resonate with that person's experiential reality. So I think that, that's really uh… important and then whereas, in my earlier manifestations, I would be thinking more about techniques and what technique do you use. It becomes more about how do you establish constructive orientations, constructive states among the two of you that generate whatever technique is going to happen and then the states that we inhabit. The mother of the technique and, and that umm… psychotherapy, that, that makes me and probably Stephen too, an acronysm (ph.), because we live in a day of, we validate protocols where the techniques of what's important and therapists to be relegated to be technicians. You have to apply the right technique for this diagnostic condition and umm… then I uh… hope to stand in opposition to that way of thinking that whereas it works perfectly fine in medicine and surgery and dentistry, where you have an algorithm and a protocol that in a human relationship that uh… relies more on uncertainties then in a deterministic world where we don't live, we live in a non-linear world when we are in therapy. We don't live in a linear world and uh… the idea that we try to make therapy into some linear equation that is based on techniques is just so diametrically opposed to my orientation. So whatever I was doing, I'm sure that I've collected a lot of techniques and along the way and that they come forward and I hope that more and more they come forward, my thinking about it and they come forward by virtue of me inhabiting a constructive and adaptive resonance state with the client that will generate whatever technique comes next. 

01:17:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And, and just to uh… add to that, I wanted to reiterate umm… how beautifully Jeff works in small chunks. You know, one of the things, you see on the floor research of chicks and (inaudible ) is that, it's not just one big flow state. Umm… in order to get into this creative flow which has these double qualities of, you do better work and it feels fantastic. You have to have this goal, you have to do this tuning, but there has to be a number of testable sub goals along the way and so this sense of establish, identify, the, the goal state in multiple representational systems, what are the resources? What are the connections here? Uh… what are the things that could interfere? These, these are all of the sort of the building the elemental of building blocks that are also crucial to delineating that allows this limbic resonance to document have a creative outcome. So it's really disciplined flow. Uh… small chunks that allow this creative wholeness. 

01:18:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So, let's take a… 

01:18:55
MITRA I just want to ask, umm… not that I'm a little bit out of the trance that when you, in the beginning, when you reached to me, because I was sweating and you said, I don't know why, but I need to do that. I think, I'm so, this is like. That's it, you know. I felt so good that you were there and it was okay. 

01:19:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh! 

01:19:20
MITRA Because I had a lot of anxiety and then when you asked me to stand up umm… and I stand up, I think there was a big shift. I'm so used to sitting and folding and, and that, you know, not being really there. But to standing up, I was there. Just wanted to thank you. 

01:19:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Simple things, small kindness and they create deep meaning. 

01:19:45
MITRA Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much. 

01:19:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So let's take a ten minute break. Let's come back at 10:30 and… 

01:19:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How many of you are not here yet? Raise your hand, if you're not here. Yeah. Okay, so we're going to do the next session obviously. I'd like to welcome Anika(ph.), right? 

01:20:20
ANIKA Anika. 

01:20:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Anika. Umm… and it's important that you be able to hear. Uh… if you cannot hear the voice is too soft, please let us know and just say louder please. Okay, can we try that uh… on the count of three, one, two, three. 

01:20:40
ANIKA Louder please. 

01:20:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, uh… and if my voice goes down which occasionally does, so it doesn't reach, I can always reach for the hand held which will give us a little bit more volume. Okay, so please give proper feedback for that. Okay, let's get to the business at hand. Umm… welcome and umm… I hope that we do some good work. We've got about 50 minutes umm… total for the work. I'm gonna ask like, for 10minutes, you hear Jeff say something, he's signaling that we got 10 minutes. So umm… Anika, what I would like to umm… suggest that we start with is, just a little settling in and settling down umm… to help uh… the both of us be able to get a little bit more centered and I'm curious and when you need to get more centered, when you need to just find yourself and connect, do you have some special things that you do? 

01:21:55
ANIKA I put my hand on my heart. 

01:22:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And I'm gonna ask you, I'm from California. So I'm gonna ask you to slow down with this and I hope it's okay if I do this in parallel. So you, you put your hand on your heart and then what happens next? 

01:22:20
ANIKA I just breathe and… 

01:22:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Just begin to breathe. 

01:22:25
ANIKA …With me. 

01:22:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Let's just do that for a couple of moments and really notice how the breath can go all the way through the body from head to toe. And I always like to become curious in terms of anything else that my intercreative self brings, as that happens. I saw a blue sky for example. I wonder if you notice anything as you begin to just breathe. 

01:23:10
ANIKA Just feeling my heart beat really fast. 

01:23:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Heart is beating fast and your beating heart would really like to say welcome. Thank you for joining the conversation. I'm sure you have a very important contribution to make to the work today. And what, what happens when you hear me say welcome to your beating heart. 

01:23:45
ANIKA I'm more here than over there. 

01:23:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

01:23:50
ANIKA I'm more back here than outside overthere, so… 

01:23:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN More back here and so it beat up more or does it stay the same. 

01:23:55
ANIKA It relaxes little bit. 

01:24:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

01:24:00
ANIKA Relaxes a bit. 

01:24:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Relaxes and I couldn't help, but notice that your body, your organism just took a nice deep breath. Did you do that consciously or did it happen just on its own? 

01:24:15
ANIKA No. On its own, yeah. 

01:24:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So sincerely like to ask your organism with all of its spontaneous creative contributions to continue to guide me and to guide you in terms of the work that we do here today. Would that be okay? 

01:24:45
ANIKA Yes. 

01:24:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So the, so the second introductory thing and I mentioned too, too, mentioned it to you when you were briefly touching base this morning. Umm… I'd like to invite you to start the formal session with three requests and it would be a request of me to say, what I'd like to ask of you is and you don't have to pre-plan, just see what comes and then of yourself. what I'd like to ask of myself for this session is and then what I'd like to ask of the community here in terms of support for the session. So and then I'll do that also. 

01:25:35
ANIKA I feel very like there is a disconnect between my voice and my emotions like I can write, I can say things on my own but when I need to say like, I love you to someone or I want to hug somebody, there is a block, I'm just stuck and… 

01:25:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that, that you'd really would like to be able to express love and hug and something stops. But, just in before that when I invite you to do is make a request about some thing that you would like for me during the work. Say, Steve, there is one thing. 

01:26:20
ANIKA I would like support and help identifying what, what that is and, and, and I'd like myself to be more open, unlock. 

01:26:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Please support me. Thanks for asking. And what in five words or less what would you ask of yourself, so what I would like to ask of myself for this time is again five words or less. 

01:27:05
ANIKA I'd like to be more open to giving and receiving love. 

01:27:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Open to giving and receiving. That's five. We got the beep. So you would like to ask of yourself, it's nice to make those suggestions to the deepest part of yourself. Please help me be more open. 

01:27:35
ANIKA Help me be more open. 

01:27:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN To giving, receiving love. 

01:27:45
ANIKA Receiving love. 

01:27:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN When, when I hear that, it feels like it goes all the way down to the root of my spine. I'm wondering how it goes through your body? 

01:28:05
ANIKA I'm just feeling a lot of contraction here like, I was shaky. 

01:28:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, so it starts moving down and then something really intense starts to activate you. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Don't you find that interesting? 

01:28:20
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:28:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And I'm, I'm sure that it makes sense. And I'd like to say to that presence. 

01:28:35
[sil.] 

01:28:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hi. And then what, what kind of support would you like to ask for from uh… the community? So what I would like to ask of all of you. 

01:29:00
[sil.] 

01:29:05
ANIKA I already feel a sense of support, the same thing that I would like from you. 

01:29:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You say it so that people all the way in the back can hear. So yell, all you in the back. 

01:29:15
ANIKA Really, I like your support being here with me through this. 

01:29:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. It's okay, if we breathe. There are a lot of support to give. Umm… you have such a beautiful smile. 

01:29:35
ANIKA Thank you. 

01:29:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm sure people tell you that all the time. Ah? 

01:29:40
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:29:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And so… like to… 

01:29:45
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:29:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So Anika… 

01:29:50
ANIKA Yeah 

01:29:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN …what I would ask of myself in our work is that I listen uh… with both my unwounded and my wounded self. 

01:30:15
[sil.] 

01:30:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And to let both of them be fully present. And what I would ask of you, I think is something similar to be willing to enjoy this beautiful loving harmony between your woundedness that requires a lot of TLC, you know, TLC. And your unwoundedness that has a such a big, big uh… energy to it. 

01:31:15
[sil.] 

01:31:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what I would like to ask of the group is that uh… you listen through your whole body that everything that is said, you feel it moving through your whole nervous system and then see what's there when you just let it move through your whole nervous system. Because, I, I think that's a way we don't project on to other people and that's a good way that we open our own uh… creative imagination. Great, so you look like you're looking out into the group after our request. You feel a little bit different. 

01:32:05
[sil.] 

01:32:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, what would you like to use their support and my support and your support to be able to create in your life? Just one thing to really, really, really, really. 

01:32:30
ANIKA Safety. Feeling of safety and… 

01:32:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Safety. That's great. And the first time that you breathe, safety through your nervous system, just notice what images appear that are your best representation at this point of safety? Interesting, to say how does my unconscious thinking about safety right now. 

01:33:10
ANIKA It feel warmth. 

01:33:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A feeling of warmth. 

01:33:15
ANIKA And some sense of holding. 

01:33:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So when you, you say the word safety and take the time to bring it through your being, a feeling of warmth, begins to join. Isn't that interesting? Isn't that nice? 

01:33:35
ANIKA Yeah, it's interesting. 

01:33:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And the sense of… 

01:33:45
ANIKA Being held. 

01:33:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. And to that place inside of you that needs a hug. 

01:34:00
ANIKA Okay. 

01:34:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What, what do you notice happening? 

01:34:05
ANIKA A lot of fluttering. 

01:34:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

01:34:10
ANIKA A lot of fluttering. 

01:34:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Fluttering. That's different from the function. So something in your sort of deeper organismic wisdom is beginning to shift. Do you think that's a fair thing to say? And what, what do you think we were doing that begin to allow your organismic wisdom to feel? It would be more like, you know, butterfly than it's now. 

01:34:45
ANIKA Recognition and… 

01:34:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Recognition. 

01:34:50
ANIKA I'm surprised that I can verbalize what I'm verbalizing right now. 

01:34:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah, well, you're talking to an Irishman. It's probably infectious. We just have stories for everything. It reminds me of another story. You're from Bangladesh region, is that right? 

01:35:10
ANIKA Mm-hmm! Right. 

01:35:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And when did you come over here? 

01:35:15
ANIKA Uh… when I was 18, 2003. 

01:35:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is it impolite to ask how old you are now? 

01:35:20
ANIKA 31. 

01:35:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN 31. Uh… and did you come over to study? 

01:35:25
ANIKA I did. I went, came from college. 

01:35:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh-huh! And you, had you, were you intending to stay or decided, you wanted to stay. 

01:35:35
ANIKA I was intending, but it also fell into place, so I stayed in school and school masters in, in the PhD program right now. 

01:35:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And do you live in the great state of Arkansas. 

01:35:45
ANIKA I do, yeah. 

01:35:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. How did you get stuck there? I mean, I. Okay. 

01:35:55
ANIKA I get that a lot. 

01:35:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN At least in California. 

01:36:00
ANIKA Actually I love the place we're in, in this little neat college town in northwest Arkansas. 

01:36:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I met, you know some of your buddies and, and your super, was it supervisor? 

01:36:10
ANIKA Yeah, he's my supervisor mentor. 

01:36:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I don't know if he's here. Was his name Rick? 

01:36:10
ANIKA Bill. 

01:36:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Really, really sweet guy. Yeah. And so that, that feeling of, of safety and security, what, what is it that you, when, when you have that, you, you most want to do be able to experience or achieve at that point in your life. Would you say, I really could feel that safety where I'd really be doing that, it's very important for me would be. 

01:36:50
ANIKA To feel more free, I feel kind of stuck. I know that the threat of wherever I, I anticipate, I know, it's not there on, on my, in my, in my head. 

01:37:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Free to do what? 

01:37:05
ANIKA Free to read. 

01:37:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm starting to get a little nosy and, and I just feel a little inclination to get out of your pathway. If you were kind of uh… extending that sort of freedom into your future say, I would want to be free to do uh… what? You can, even do a little movement first and see as your organism does it or that your body wisdom says, how about this one? 

01:37:40
ANIKA Okay, free to be open like be me like not feel so tight all the time. 

01:37:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Open or open. 

01:37:50
ANIKA Open. 

01:37:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Open and if you were open to moving some place in your future, what do you think you'd be doing in the future? 

01:38:10
ANIKA Be able to appreciate the love and support I already have. 

01:38:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah! And would there be certain people that would be really great, said really like to appreciate the love that is this person is giving and by the way, we, we all have a commitment to confidentiality here, so what stays here, what is said here stays here. And the reason I'm, I'm asking is I think for most of us, it's only when we start to name it specifically that it starts to become a reality in the world. When it's abstract, it's just sort of an idea and really what we're looking to do is how can I bring my dream into reality. So that's why I'm, I'm asking you these questions. 

01:39:05
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:39:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Say, if I was safe and free, I would really like to be more open in just giving and receiving love with… 

01:39:15
ANIKA Yeah, this, this conference I was with that big group and my supervisor and he's been this warm and friendly and supportive person. 

01:39:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah 

01:39:25
ANIKA And, and I noticed, you know, all of us have been studying with him for a long time and we people can just go up and give him a hug and, and he's just this warm and, and I, I want to, but I'm restricted. 

01:39:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

01:39:35
ANIKA I do that with my co-workers also, but, you know, that's what, I think brought up this feeling, this weekend. 

01:39:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… can we just stop and breathe that. That's a beautiful and heartfelt description. Well, for one I'd like to have the choice to be able to just give my supervisor a nice simple hug. I don't know what it's like for you to imagine that. I know just that when I imagine that and it breathes through my body, I see stars and sparkles and something in the shadow and the horizon that I became curious about. I wonder what, what happens for you. So, when I began to bring out this image. 

01:40:40
ANIKA Mm-hmm! It's almost like a shame. 

01:40:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Shame. 

01:40:50
ANIKA Shame. 

01:40:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So something, some present that had been shamed at some point in your life shows up. Isn't that great? Isn't that nice that she has dropped by? 

01:41:00
ANIKA She does do a lot. 

01:41:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well. Okay. What, what language do you speak in Bangladesh, excuse my Hindi? 

01:41:10
ANIKA Bengali. 

01:41:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Bengali. How do you say hello in Bengali? 

01:41:20
ANIKA (inaudible ), which is more how are you? 

01:41:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry, you're, you're mumbling. 

01:41:25
ANIKA (inaudible ). 

01:41:27
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… so you just, you just say that one, that, that version of hello? 

01:41:30
[sil.] 

01:41:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I, I have a Chinese wife. I thought Mandarin. 

01:41:40
ANIKA Well, I grew up learning English, so it's, it's more, more yeah. 

01:41:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. So, on that pathway to uh… giving your uh… supervisor a hug, this presents and if I ask you whether a number come that represented an age for that part that at some point had been shamed uh… just notice what number pops in? 

01:42:10
ANIKA Four, four. 

01:42:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… where do you feel her living in your body? 

01:42:20
[sil.] 

01:42:25
ANIKA I'm getting all up here. 

01:42:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. That's good to know that she has a home here. Isn't that good to know that she has a home in by some interesting wisdom that when you go to really connect your love with another person in a professional context, personal context that she probably is going to be joining you. Isn't that great? 

01:43:10
ANIKA It needs some convincing. 

01:43:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't that great if you hear me, hear my prophesy that wherever those love she will be on. So, what happens when you hear me say that? 

01:43:25
[sil.] 

01:43:30
ANIKA I do have a, like wanting to get rid of her and, and so when you say that, I'm like yeah, I know but. 

01:43:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, so what has been your, your favorite techniques for trying to get rid of her? 

01:43:50
ANIKA Negative, self-stuck. 

01:43:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

01:43:50
ANIKA Negative, self-stuck. That kind of showing myself up. 

01:43:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How does that one work? Plan B. 

01:44:00
ANIKA I need a Plan B. 

01:44:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well, if she, if she still is around, umm… uh… 27 years later, just Plan B would be a good question? When, when you, when I say welcome… 

01:44:25
[sil.] 

01:44:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN …to her… what do you notice happen for her? 

01:44:45
ANIKA I feel more relaxed now. 

01:44:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Enough about you. What about her? 

01:44:55
ANIKA On the mic uh… 

01:44:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It, it can be helpful just to make this differentiation, yeah, I don't mean it in any strange way, but just that we, we've got our sort of our cognitive self in the head and then we've got this presence that lives in our belly, our heart and that when we go into these personal situations like intimacy or our love, this part of you probably gets to be the lead system and so you know, when she was four, I'm sorry for whatever happened and because for a four year old to end up feeling shame something was done that wasn't appropriate and I'm sorry for whatever happened. And I'm sorry that, that place inside of you had to shut down and go away. But, I'm really glad and that you kept going on your path. Made it out to the United States and got to graduate school and got your degree and now you're, you're also facing another momentous occasion, is that private or… 

01:46:45
ANIKA I can share. 

01:46:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… 

01:46:45
ANIKA I can share. 

01:46:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What's that? 

01:46:50
ANIKA I'm pregnant. 

01:46:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh… so something has been born here maybe a little lower. 

01:47:00
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:47:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… and how many months pregnant, if I may ask? 

01:47:05
ANIKA Four. 

01:47:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Four. Do you know the sex? 

01:47:10
ANIKA Not yet. I'll know when I get home, I think. 

01:47:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

01:47:10
ANIKA I'll know when I get home. 

01:47:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great. Wow. Is there something you've been wanting to happen? 

01:47:25
ANIKA Mm-hmm, yes, yeah. 

01:47:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Congratulations. 

01:47:25
ANIKA Thank you. 

01:47:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Really happy for you, for your husband, for your husband, great. So as you have discovered that you're pregnant, has this presence here that sort of lived and sort of shame and darkness has it started to activate more? 

01:47:50
[sil.] 

01:47:55
ANIKA I think being pregnant and thinking of myself as a mother, I don't have any other terror and, and having this, I want to be open to being able to do that with my baby and, and not to stay so, it makes me want to open up. 

01:48:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah! So when you hold that intention, I, I really want to be open up to what's here. Maybe, you can bring your hand there and touch that place. I don't know if you've already begun to feel the connection with your baby. And that sort of like there is two, two births that's happening. And that as this beautiful mothering is awakening in you, what it's like to say, hello baby and hello baby. I'm here with you. 

01:49:20
[sil.] 

01:49:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN you know, I did my, my doctoral dissertation on theory of emotion where looking at how uh… emotion could be a state dependent learning variable. So… on my dissertation committee at Stanford was Phillips Embardo(ph.) and David uh… Rosenheim who uh… interesting guy and he kept saying, how would you define shame? And this theory and I had the hardest time, because I'm Catholic, we experience more guilt. We're not connoisseurs about shame. Umm… and it took me a while to think what that shame, what sort of relationship message, the experience of shame was, was reflecting? But, do you have any sense either in your professional sense, your personal sense that, that plays inside of me, got the message that. 

01:50:50
ANIKA It's like being needy to, to want I should be independent. I should not need to do that with other people or have any sense of need to… 

01:51:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. 

01:51:10
ANIKA So I don't feel like I'm enough, I guess with. 

01:51:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That really touches my heart when you share that. I just want to thank you for the point of view, if I was your father, your brother, I would umm… feel very angry and, and sad that somebody told you that. But the paranoia, you haven't given up. That something inside of you has kept going and saying, I want it, I need it. I want to find the resources and the freedom and the safety to say, I need a hug, I want to give a hug to you. Am I understanding correctly? 

01:52:10
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:52:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great! So, if you sense that inside, if you were to let your inner wisdom bring you any image or memory or person or feeling or color that would represent a resource and would be part of your team that would be helping you to say, of course, you need love, of course, you need to receive a hug, of course. Who, who shows up? 

01:53:05
ANIKA Bill. 

01:53:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great and if you were just to imagine where he would be situated. 

01:53:15
[sil.] 

01:53:20
ANIKA Like a support behind me. 

01:53:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great! Great! It feels nice to feel his presence in our conversation. We can't help, but notice that your breathing changes and you notice that too kind of nice message your organism is giving you. That's right. That's right you're on the right path. We do maybe uh… I would like to suggest we, we do more, one more thing that I think might be helpful for your cause. Would it be okay, if we stood up? Umm… so just do a little standing and just we were talking about, get this stuff out of the way here. 

01:54:15
[sil.] 

01:54:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Maybe you can stand over here? Talking about, sort of thinking about umm… moving forward in your life in the next days, weeks, in a way what, what would your sort of unconscious mind give as a response in terms of, I would like to see experience myself hugging somebody freely in two days, two weeks, two months, what, what sort of pops in? 

01:54:50
ANIKA Two months. 

01:54:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Two months? Where did that come from? Get out of here. You can't play that one with me. Did anybody hear me say two months? 

01:55:05
ANIKA It sounded right. 

01:55:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It sounded right. So you heard it as a sound. Who's voice was that? Sort of you know, playfully challenging you, because I'm sure that's part of your wisdom connection too. You know, which you feel here. The way you touch, the places that need safety and the way that you hear these voices, some inner presence when you ask a question. That's part of your creative shield in a way. Your creative boundary that wraps around you so that you feel that what's touching you is, is your own creative support team. Do you feel what your organism just did there? To feel, now take a nice breath. Your body knows so much. Wait, you're gonna be a great mom. So what I'm gonna suggest is that we do something called a little bit of a timeline. You know what a timeline is? So just sort of imagine that two weeks and to realize that the only real movement will be movement that includes this four year old present here that's giving the connection of safety, so you can't outrun her or leave her behind, because you just go, you have to disassociate away from your body. Wherever you go, she's in your body. 

01:57:20
ANIKA When I said two months, it was here, she needs more time. 

01:57:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She needs more time. Oh, that's cool. And how did you find out? 

01:57:35
ANIKA I felt embarrassed and I was, I wanted to ask. 

01:57:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great, so you're learning that the conscious mind, didn't I have now asked in 23 cultures that I haven't asked in Bangladeshi culture. So, you're gonna be number 24. In your culture, do you have the story of the race between the turtle and the rabbit? 24 out of 24. 

01:58:05
ANIKA Yeah. 

01:58:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Some, some places have variations like the, the Germans killed all of their uh… turtles so they have hedgehogs. Isn't that interesting that every culture has found it important to tell their stories, their children in a trance that there is two parts of you. There is a rabbit that's going faster, faster, faster, two weeks, no, two months, two days, no, two hours, no, two minutes, two seconds, no. Meanwhile back at around is the place that carries new life that's saying, you need time to let this birth develop inside of you. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much connection do you feel to that place, that historically has felt unsafe and shamed? 

01:59:20
ANIKA Five. 

01:59:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Five, please notice where that number came from? 

01:59:30
[sil.] 

01:59:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Now as you create in the unconscious, it's always there waiting to help you. Different, at least, equally important question, how much connection do you feel with that person that need safety? 

02:00:00
[sil.] 

02:00:10
ANIKA My legs are shaking. 

02:00:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

02:00:10
ANIKA My legs are shaking. 

02:00:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh. Yeah, it just want to save, it's a typical sign that something is releasing. Do you need some support for a moment, I'm offering you my hand, something is releasing. You're really doing some, some really good work right now. I send you lots, lots and lots of support. It's a beautiful thing to discover how much you need, how much I need, how much the baby needs, how much your husband needs that connection. What happens in your body now? 

02:01:10
ANIKA I feel better. Stabilized… 

02:01:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, let's, let's just think about going on this little journey. If at any point by the way, you need to reach out for my support, just extend your hand out and it's offered freely. Umm… and to say what are the things that I can do over the coming weeks and months that will allow me from the inside out to find this connection to this little vulnerable place of power that not only needs, but really wants connection with others. So let's do a little tuning and feel there is a presence inside of you and as it begin to awaken into the world, it really met initially some negative messages. You can feel sympathy, understanding and the fact that despite on that negative message, it, it stayed in your body, stayed in your core, stayed in your soul and now you as a 31 year old can send that message down, I'm with you. I want to give to you. I want to receive from you. Together, we become a human being. When you feel that connection, I ask you to just to take a few small steps as a way of sort of organismically sensing the steps that you can be taking in the coming weeks, oh, small, turtle not rabbit. Can you show me how a turtle takes step? That's a pretty fast turtle. You can be a better turtle than that, can't you? 

02:04:25
ANIKA I can try. 

02:04:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, let me see your true turtle. That's better. And just notice that when you go with turtle speed and seriously what happens here? Is she happier, is she more scared, is she hind, is she relaxed? Going to move at a slow, same, step by step. You are kind of used to the life of a turtle. 

02:05:20
ANIKA I feel more, it's, it's how the shaking is back a little bit. 

02:05:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah! And… 

02:05:30
ANIKA And like I, this hesitation. 

02:05:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's great. So what do you think that hesitation is calling you to do in terms of your connection to her? You tell her, tell her to shut up and go faster, get over it. Practicing for baby. 

02:06:00
ANIKA It said, it need for hug. 

02:06:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's beautiful. That's great. So just take that time about, one of the really nice things when you open your body wisdoms, you discover that in just five seconds of collect time, you feel like, you get five months of connection. It's one of those beautiful mysterious gifts that the unconscious can give you. Just taking five breaths and feel like five weeks, nurturing, Oh… baby be… What's your Bangladeshi nursery song? 

02:07:10
ANIKA It will be grabbed with English ones. 

02:07:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What would be the one that came? 

02:07:20
ANIKA Twinkle, twinkle. 

02:07:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh… can you hum a few words? 

02:07:25
ANIKA No. 

02:07:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know, of course, you need to do it. Don't just blame it on me. How about we do it together? 

02:07:30
ANIKA Okay. 

02:07:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It will help you in practice, right, you're in training. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder, what you are. 

02:07:45
ANIKA Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder, what you are. 

02:08:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh, and how is the baby responding to that? 

02:08:10
ANIKA He likes it. 

02:08:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She likes it. The lower one or the upper one? 

02:08:15
ANIKA The upper one, I feel it right now. 

02:08:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How do you know she likes it? Is she like going yippie, wow? 

02:08:30
ANIKA Just curious. Just curious. 

02:08:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How do you know she's curious? Has she got those big eyes? So maybe, we can take another couple of turtle steps and then you notice when you need to pause again. It's really a beautiful thing listening to the intelligence of your organism. It's a beautiful preparation, awakening your mothering and just feel as you take those turtle baby steps. Some things don't shake in your lower half, shaking a little. Shaking like a tree and your, your body recognizes, I can't go any further right now. Isn't that great to know? It's beautiful. And I take that pause and you be curious, what would be… another song to sing? 

02:10:05
[sil.] 

02:10:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sing one. Can we get this a little bit louder? Will it be also twinkle twinkle? 

02:10:20
ANIKA Twinkle, twinkle right now. 

02:10:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay. Do you want me to sing it with you? 

02:10:25
ANIKA Yes. 

02:10:30
ANIKA And a one, and a two, and a three. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are? Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder, what you are. 

02:11:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow… that's the same melody as ABC, right? ABCDEFG. You know what I was just imagining, my daughter is now 23 umm… she's really an intense athletic kid and my mom came down, Joey was about eight and uh… my mom uh… who just died last year, she had been getting frail and Joey had not seen her grandma for about five months and she was at soccer practice and she came home in her Cleats and her outfit. My mom and I were standing over uh… in the umm… uh… dining room and Joey comes in and she says, "Grandma." And she starts running. And I'm thinking no, this isn't about to happen. I, I know Joey, but it couldn't, she's not gonna do what flashed in front of my eyes. There was a flash in front of my eyes. 

02:12:05
ANIKA Knocking over grandma… 

02:12:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN She came the running and she leaped in the air and slams into my grandmother, my mother is pretty frail and there is this momentary pause and then a seconding thud and my mom's head hits the, the ground. I said Joey, and my mom looks up probably concussed and said, it's okay, she's just happy to see me. 

02:12:40
[sil.] 

02:12:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So would you do turtle or rabbit? 

02:12:50
[sil.] 

02:13:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow, you give great hugs. I, I would be the line should form right here. You may have booked yourself all afternoon. Want to sit down for just a second? I think we'll begin to… 

02:13:25
[sil.] 

02:13:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That was really fun working with you like that. Was it good for you too? 

02:13:40
[sil.] 

02:13:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And, and you'd like to share, you know, I was just so touched by the depth of your feeling and you know, it's a strange thing. If there is a divine, surely the divine has the most perverse sense of humor, because it takes this little spirit and finds out the qualities that most present in the spirit and then looks for the family that will least understand it. Oh, there is a nick, so feeling and connecting and loving. Let's find a family that disallows that and have a nice life. 

02:14:35
[sil.] 

02:14:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm, I'm glad you made it through. It's really, it's real beautiful to, to feel your, your loving presence umm… come out and uh… I'm pretty happy for you that you bring that baby into the world and, and that something that you and your husband and baby can, can really enjoy, uh… a loving connection. Anything you'd, you'd like to say before we end? 

02:15:15
ANIKA I had a lot of surprise that how like warm those feeling, all that give is the… 

02:15:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, warm, shaky. Yeah. 

02:15:20
ANIKA …shivering almost and it's really warm. 

02:15:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. And that again, I would say uh… you know, how do we know trance is developing, because of the appearance of trance phenomenon and most of the time these appearances are the subjectively compelling umm… experiences in somatically, auditory or visually, it starts moving from a fixed constant to a variable and one of the major is the body starts to experiencing warmth or lightness or tingling uh… or shaking. We know from the, the trauma research, particularly uh… the what Peter Levine (ph.) is doing that when the body starts to release from its trauma trance that shaking is the way that organismically that it does that and Peter, you know, does this beautiful work noting that if it happens too fast and a person feels unsafe and overwhelmed, when they try to put on the brakes that's what is traumatizing them. But if they can happen in little bits and chunks in what, what they call titration, then the shaking can unfold what I'm calling the locked trauma trance and of course, if you were four years old and you were just this loving little being and you wanted to hug and you got the message repeatedly, we don't do that in this family that would be pretty clear trauma. And out of self-loved, you would lock yourself into trauma trance. Traumatic disassociation is an act of self-love. It's the best thing that you can do as a short term strategy, as a long term strategy, it sucks. It's a short term strategy. It is an act of self-love. So when we feel the warmth or the shaking, we are looking to give it a positive frame and, and invited to happen in a way that a person is able to stay connected to you, to themselves to the resources, because I think that's where there are a real contextual shift happens. Any, any comments you would make in terms of your, your experience of relation? 

02:18:05
ANIKA So much you were just saying just getting your hand was really… 

02:18:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Holding my hand at that point. 

02:18:10
ANIKA …Yeah, it kind of brought, because I was self focused on the shakiness and the. 

02:18:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. And so that's something I will do somebody gets a little bit shaky is just extend my hand, you know, I'm sure, many of you do that. Umm… just that feeling of, of I'm here, I'm connecting with another human being. They can use that to not get totally lost in the shaking and it expands the context of the self is in the context. I'm here, I'm shaking as a part of me rather than shaking as all of me. That's the difference between an experience that you can allow and an experience that you have to disconnect from. If you feel, it's all of you, then you have to try to disconnect from it. If you feel, it's here, it's intense, but there is other parts of me that are here, I have other connections, then I can not only tolerate it, I can become curious about it. Okay, I'm gonna ask Jeff to umm… come on up and it's okay, if you stay here? Okay, so let's give uh… Anika appreciation. 

02:19:25
ANIKA Thank you. 

02:19:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'll just ask, did any of you get therapy out of that for yourself? Just a couple of you. Come on therapists, wake up. 

02:19:40
JEFFREY ZEIG It was a beautiful work and you were really uh… danced together very beautifully and you know congratulations to you for moving forward and uh… in a very umm… profound way. 

02:19:50
ANIKA Thank you. 

02:19:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. So umm… there were, you know, first of all, a little bit of an apology, because my concentration wasn't as good as it could possibly be being in a meeting organizer having done so much over the past five days. There were a little lapses in my uh… in my consciousness and I apologize for that. It was just uh… physical exhaustion. 

02:20:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You noticed when I smiled though. 

02:20:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. And your smile was great. Yeah and use of humor was really great and that, you know, the juxtaposition between the softness of your support and the prodding nature of your humor was, was very pretty. It's a combination of using umm… this comforting state, loving states and also juxtaposition into using more arousal states. 

02:20:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

02:20:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And so I think that demonstrates something really nice for people here that just uh… having a very umm… lovingly, thoughtful quiet state is only part of the experience and that needs, there needs to be some condiments and some of those condiments is using humor. 

02:21:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, and you can see Anika sort of, her sort of present state was more withdrawn and soft, so you don't want to stay there. You needed to open up if she's gonna do any learning. 

02:21:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! And then what were you thinking about when you were doing these reflective moments like you go inside yourself, you rely on your sensations, your imagery. What were you thinking about when you were doing that? 

02:21:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm sort of thinking here in terms of we have a goal that we want to achieve and how can everything that arises be used to towards that goal. That's my primary thought and I, I want to model and invite the client to be doing what I'm doing. Not the content, but the sense that, that everything that I say or think about, I want to reference it through my system and see how my system responds to it. Because this combination to me is the, the loop that we need for wholeness. So I think, I'm trying to model that and then thirdly, a lot of times, it's where things come up that I wouldn't have thought of consciously. And, and I'm curious when I say that, you know, as I say, I've got a king of hearts, what card do you have? The, the symbols that come up for the client are usually things that they would not have thought of in the verbal mind and they become really usually often important contributions to, to the process. 

02:22:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So your openness to your own process inviting the other person to see more deeply aware, more open to their own process. 

02:23:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, absolutely. 

02:23:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, and then there is a lot of overlap between the things that we do like using gestural language. What you're thinking, when you're using gestures rather than words to represent things? 

02:23:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I, all the gestures that I make, I don't think about, I, I sort of jokingly say that's my Italian side of me. But I, I notice what my body is doing and moving particularly when I'm doing trance, because my hands start to move and I'm just listening and watching, because it feels to me like my body is expressing something that my verbal mind should know about. So, it's sort of tracking, I mean the same way that formally in a trance, Erickson used to use a lot of hand invitation and not only as just a phenomena of, of the hand floating but you learn a lot of communications in how those hands are moving. So, I just noticed over the years that when I, when I was talking with a certain limbic attunement, my hands would start moving and I, I think they're telling, they're saying something, so I, I want to be in that feedback. So similar to the conscious mind cannot solve the challenge by itself. It can, it can do accounting, it can go get a cup of coffee, but for these changes that people are facing in therapy, the verbal intellectual mind is insufficient. So it needs to be linked to these other modes of intelligence, somematically image and the mind is that what embeds the pattern that connects and then we realize some of those things are not initiated by our voluntary thinking. That's what we learn in trance. You don't have to be in trance to notice, your unconscious is always telling you something. 

02:25:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. And then you know, if you compare this session to other sessions that you would do in your office, were you gentler? Were you softer? Were, was there anything different about the way that you were, that you would be in your office and did that reflect to Anika? Anika? Yeah. 

02:25:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Anika. Anika. 

02:25:25
UNKNOWN Anika. 

02:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Anika. Uh-huh! 

02:25:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… I would never say that it's like any other session. Uh… but these, these the, the different qualities of what I call archetypal energies which to me, I specially picked up from Milton Erickson that noticing that Erickson would say, play with the full deck. He had, he was the most tender human being, you know, to, to touch you in a loving kind way that I've ever met. He was also the fiercest guy. You, you didn't want to cross this guy. You know, he had a great bullshit detector. Umm… he have this warrior's capacity of fierceness and then we all hear about the extraordinary playfulness that Erickson had. So my feeling is that those three qualities are the musicality that allows an idea to creatively be realized. So what you're doing like you're, you're hooking up with a person and I'm sensing, you know, she's tilting a little bit into too much tenderness, right? And she's a little bit sort of a more starting stage, she's withdrawn, she's quiet, her hair is in front of her eyes. So to join her, I'm going to use tenderness. But, I've got to pop her out of that state and, and so, you know, there is, there is where my Irish ancestors come in, in terms of the playfulness. So I find that, I use playfulness whenever it feels like they're becoming a fundamentalist when they're, they're, they've lost their ability to, to think in terms of well, it could be this way or that way and the problem has gotten too serious. You know, I like to say, life is much too serious to not have a good sense of humor. So we all know during the session that the client will start to get too serious at certain points. So I have that sort of detection, okay and then the, the use of fierceness, you know, I want to use fierceness without, without invading boundaries. And to me, I, I hold back in this first session on the fierceness, you know, I thought the timeline and keeping the focus on something that you want to do. Umm… uh… and bringing the, the responsibilities of motherhood. Those were part of the underlying fierceness. I think if we continued to work, I would probably up the fierceness and be curious about how to activate Anika's warrior one. So that you know, she could have some curiosity if anybody fucks with me, technically speaking is that I'll, I'll bring out my sword. You know, uh… one of the things and sometimes how people practice is, I will share with, I will share my love with you, but if you fuck with me, I'll kill you. Nothing personal, I, I studied, I keyed all for many years, I have two very sharp swords in my office. They are all wrapped up in very Japanese tradition. On occasion and I find it, I do it more with women than men. No, I do, because for women to have this sense of, of don't fuck with me. It, it usually it's, it's a bigger challenge. I'm, I'm talking in generalizations. They have that sense, I will protect myself, you know, I have been given a life, a precious gift of life and in the same way that you have that commitment to your children, you know, that I would die for my child. How many of you that have kids know that? Isn't that a great feeling? You know, to know that, that I have a total commitment to protect my child's life. Well, really to live freely, we need to have that commitment to our own life. Right, I'm not talking about becoming uh… a violent person. I'm talking about being able to know how to carry a sword and say no. And, and to keep your boundaries. That's what fierceness is about. I think that would become a more permanent energy as the therapy continues. 

02:30:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So, if I'm thinking for example, strategically and you're thinking archetypically, archetypically, is you're thinking about archetypes. 

02:30:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

02:30:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And you're thinking about the strength of some of the archetypes in your client and you're thinking about the archetypes that you want to develop and the qualities of those archetypes and that's one thing that guides you in creating the uh… 

02:30:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, absolutely. 

02:30:55
JEFFREY ZEIG The movement. 

02:30:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But to me uh… they, when, what you would call strategic and what you're calling archetypal, they're, they're very similar, because how do we get to where you want to be in your life? And saying, here is what you're going to need as resources in order to meet the challenges. You're gonna have to make a commitment. You're gonna have to keep, keep to the commitment. You're gonna have to be able to say no. You're gonna have to open. You're gonna have to feel this gentleness. You're gonna have to be able to put yourself at ease, other peoples at ease. You're gonna have to be able to laugh. So to me those are, I would think of them, I don't know strategic is the best. But, it's about how do you keep walking on the path of your life to create a fullness. 

02:31:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And the, the way that you opened like centering, that's very typical of you. 

02:31:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's very typical. 

02:31:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh and important for you. 

02:31:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think so. And… 

02:32:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Even before you know what the concern is that… 

02:32:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, well, I think it goes, it can go either way. Some clients, it just feels better to sit down, how you're doing a couple, manage yourself, casual, social talk, how's the weather, how is the traffic? What would you like to do today? And give them a couple of minutes to, just sort of stay in, in their own best way, the goal and then to say, great in order to do that work. I want to make sure that we are both at our best and so I would like to suggest that we both take a few moments to do something called centering. The words that you use and the ways that you do it, you have to be tremendously flexible. Because, it has to, it has to work for that particular client. 

02:32:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, well, just one or two more quick reflections and see what comments uh… other people have, it was really, we saw the audience chime in, right the audience chimed in. I think, because you primed them to chime in. 

02:33:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. 

02:33:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And their, their chiming in was "spontaneous." 

02:33:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. 

02:33:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And for Anika, very valuable to feel that support from community and you opened up the uh… opportunity for that to happen and then the reaching out was really important, the singing was really important, the uh…, you know the turtle and the hare was really valuable, the way that you came back to that, made that part integral to, to the movement was very valuable. Staging things, using the uh… the stage as an opportunity to feel progressively that movement, reframing the shaking, helping her to understand that the shaking was a natural part of the process. Looking into the shadow side of things, not just relying on being syrupy, saccharin, very sweet about being tender, but also looking into making sure that any of the wounded side or any of the darker side was supported and that could be put into place. So it was very beautiful, really beautifully done. 

02:34:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I was, so much for not paying attention. Uh… Imagine what he'll get if he pays attention. 

02:34:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. So let's see what uh… what comments or questions we have from the audience? We have a volunteer with microphone, I hope. Great! So we have two questions up here in the front. George would be one and… 

02:34:40
UNKNOWN Thank you very much (inaudible ). 

02:34:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Welcome. 

02:34:45
UNKNOWN Umm… Steven Lee from Connecticut. I have a question. It has to do with some of your lectures uh… this week for about systems. Uh… Jeff I've heard you talk many times about identities. And I just want, is this a similar construct between where it's this something it's more, a little slightly different and I just want to make sure, I'm understanding these terms correctly. 

02:35:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's, it's a good question. Umm… you know, one way to think about that is, you are dealing in my view between a complementarily, between a person's relationship to their internal self and equally important their relationships externally to all the people in their life. So… you have to make a choice in terms of which context you're gonna prioritize at a given, at any given point in, in the therapy. Umm… I thought for this because the core inner feeling, it was so strong that, that would be a good place to start. If I talked about her external uh… relationships, I didn't feel that she could be sufficiently differentiated to, to talk well about those. So I thought, it would be better to have that, that inner strengthening first and, and ultimately how does that play out in, in the systems in your life. Not only the present systems, but how do these present systems like, umm… you know, she's got a big one coming up that initiates all sorts of spontaneous trance experiences, your first baby. You know, in terms of your marriage or relationship with yourself, your, your relationship with your family origin. So that to me would be like, I was talking about the sense of fierceness, something that I think would be in the future of the work. 

02:37:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay George, something. 

02:37:05
GEORGE Yeah, George (inaudible )Alaska. Uh… after you did your initial contact, I think I, I stopped called it 14 inductions. And then I noticed that you umm… went from one client to two clients, to three clients, four clients, then you had 86 right. 

02:37:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What do you mean, I went to two clients… 

02:37:30
GEORGE You have, you included so many different elements. Each one had its own structure, its own personality, its own piece in the puzzle. 

02:37:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

02:37:40
GEORGE And brought and you brought them in, brought them out. 

02:37:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. 

02:37:45
GEORGE Helped them to reintegrate and essentially created a community of family. 

02:37:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. That, that to me is a guiding map. It's what Arthur Kellsler (ph.) called a whole lot. And a whole lot, he said, this wonderful 64 book, the act of creation, something that is whole within itself but merely a fragment of a greater whole. Persistent suffering in my view reflects an isolation of a part from its greater whole. So… another way of saying it is when you have only one perspective, we call that fundamentalism and it's destroying the world. Even the pope, Jesuit pope came out and said it that fundamentalism is the most destructive force in the world today. When you have only one man So we're trying to in, in many ways is that always have multiple maps present. Now, there could be too many maps. So you're looking to find this aesthetic intelligence that you're moving from multiple frames to a common underlying, unifying idea. But it could be this way, it could be that way and that, that is classic Milton Erickson. You know, uh… you know, while I was, well, I would say where they (inaudible ) and dictum was, where ego was, it shall be Erickson's dictum was where one way was, many shall be. So, I, I think you're looking to have multiplicity in a larger context as a guiding principle to creativity. 

02:39:30
GEORGE Thank you. 

02:39:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Welcome. 

02:39:35
JEFFREY ZEIG We need to uh… stop, because it's 12, noon. So we have a choice and one choice is to make lunch 90 minutes and that's fine and another choice is to make lunch an hour and that's equally fine. Umm… being Monday, if you're going outside of the hotel, probably an hour and a half would be okay. But, why don't we do an hour and 15 minutes? What would you, what, what, what's the sentiment? How many people prefer an hour? How many an hour, 15? How many an hour and a half? 

02:40:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And three hours. 

02:40:10
JEFFREY ZEIG So let's come back in 1 hour and 15 minutes. We'll come back at 1:15 please. 

02:40:20
[sil.] 

02:40:25
JEFFREY ZEIG So it was important to you and something that you wanted to have happen and now we've made it happen. 

02:40:35
CRYSTER Yes. 

02:40:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And now that you're here, where is it that you want yourself to get to? 

02:40:40
CRYSTER Well, uh… the situation that I was interested in being at was the issue around closeness and intimacy, fear of intimacy. Kind of freezing up with and real intimate situations. Being close and open with other people. 

02:41:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, help me to understand that. Like, let's say for a moment that you're sent on holiday and you're going on a vacation to a lovely beach area and I have to be Cryster. 

02:41:15
CRYSTER Okay. 

02:41:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And you're my coach, you're my director and you're going to explain to me how to do fear of intimacy. 

02:41:25
CRYSTER Okay. 

02:41:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Please help me to understand how to do that? 

02:41:30
CRYSTER How to, okay. So I think… 

02:41:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You, to me, talk to me. I'm, you're coaching me. You're explaining to me, I'm going to be understand, you're gonna be on holiday at the beach. I have to do fear of intimacy. 

02:41:45
CRYSTER So you, so you can be… curious and open to other people and be hesitant about moving forward and reaching out to people, but you'll find a way to do that. And… 

02:41:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So now I'm curious about you as a representative and I want to move forward and reach out to you. So far so good, now, how do I do fear of intimacy? 

02:42:10
CRYSTER So then you're, you're starting to hold yourself back after… 

02:42:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Oops, how do I get there? Where I start to hold myself back? 

02:42:15
CRYSTER Well, when it starts to get them little too close and… 

02:42:20
JEFFREY ZEIG But how will I know? Is this too close or… 

02:42:25
CRYSTER A little bit. 

02:42:25
JEFFREY ZEIG It's a little bit too close. Uh-huh. Where would I know that I was getting a little too close, because it was something… 

02:42:35
CRYSTER Yeah, you would, you would feel that in your body. You would feel that in your body. 

02:42:40
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know what I would feel in my body. 

02:42:40
CRYSTER You feel probably a little bit of a dizziness uh… umm… in your head sort of… 

02:42:50
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know that I can get there quite yet. So I'm trying to get there and put myself in this situation, because I have to be you when you're on holiday. 

02:43:00
CRYSTER All right. 

02:43:00
JEFFREY ZEIG So, it's something bing, bing, bing, something little alarm, bing, bing, bing. It's a little too close. 

02:43:05
CRYSTER Yes! It's a bit of an alarm in my, in your head and in your whole body. You feel it in your arms, a sense of… 

02:43:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Feeling, what do I feel in my arms? 

02:43:15
CRYSTER I think, you feel a sense of weakening, numbness. 

02:43:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Weakening numbness. 

02:43:20
CRYSTER Yeah, a little bit like that. 

02:43:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

02:43:25
CRYSTER And uh… self-consciousness. You're becoming and you, you're not sure you want to do it. Your, maybe taking a step forward, but now you're kind of holding on to yourself in a way where, where you're not sure this is safe. That it's safe and you're not sure that you, you can really do it that you're good at it. 

02:43:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, safe from… 

02:43:55
CRYSTER Safe from uh… safe from… 

02:43:55
JEFFREY ZEIG I can think to myself, I'm not gonna be able to do this, I'm not safe, I'm not gonna be able to do this. I'm not safe. 

02:44:05
CRYSTER Safe from uh… being made fun of, being ridiculed, being rejected, not being seen, being thrown away at some capacity. 

02:44:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm afraid that somehow I will be humiliated. 

02:44:20
CRYSTER Mm-hmm! Shame and shame. 

02:44:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Somehow, I will shame myself or somehow somebody will shame me. 

02:44:25
CRYSTER Shame me. Shame you. 

02:44:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, shame me, okay. And so then I start to uh… 

02:44:35
CRYSTER Tighten up, tighten up. 

02:44:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

02:44:35
CRYSTER And look for either withdrawing, but staying there, but withdrawing or find reasons or opportunities to, to get away more completely. 

02:44:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so I could leave the field, I could tighten up, I could go away physically. I could go away umm… behaviorally. 

02:44:55
CRYSTER Right. 

02:45:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh. Okay so now why would I want to change this? It seems to work and it seems to keep me safe? 

02:45:05
CRYSTER It's so limiting. It's so umm… missing out on opportunities. It just feels too lonely. 

02:45:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, so… safe uh… the, the cost of safe is being lonely. 

02:45:25
CRYSTER Exactly. It's lonely and lacking growth and opportunity. It's, it's safe, but it's, it's sort of a deadness not much there. Right. 

02:45:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It's numbness, it's loss of energy. Okay, now umm… how do I know when to do this? Do I do this with children, do I do this… 

02:45:45
CRYSTER Less with children. 

02:45:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Less with children. 

02:45:50
CRYSTER Yeah, much less with children. 

02:45:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So, how do I know with whom to do this? 

02:45:55
CRYSTER Okay. With, yeah it's a good question. With whom? Umm… well, it could be with people that you start to take a liking to, you start to feel that, there could be something there, it could be a connection and then you get scared of the connection. So, it's almost like wow, you get the sense that there is a possibility, there is an opportunity and then you better run. 

02:46:30
JEFFREY ZEIG You better run. So you, okay, because you might be humiliated, you might humiliate yourself, you might be ashamed, you might ashamed yourself? Uh-huh, okay and uh… let's say that you continue doing this for five years. 

02:46:45
CRYSTER Okay. 

02:46:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Where would you be? You continue this pattern. Let's call the pattern something. What would you like to name it? 

02:47:00
CRYSTER Umm… uh… Staying and hiding. 

02:47:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Hiding. 

02:47:00
CRYSTER Hiding. 

02:47:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So this is Cryster's hiding pattern. Okay, so let's say that you continue hiding, where will you be in five years? 

02:47:10
CRYSTER Well, that's the thing. That's you when you stay in hiding, you, you stay basically in the same place and uh… and because that's safe, but it's kind of repetitive and that you may sort of move out in small pieces here and there but fundamentally, the experience is the same. 

02:47:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so 10 years from now, you continue hiding. 

02:47:40
CRYSTER Hiding. 

02:47:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! 20 years from now, you continue hiding, where would you be? 

02:47:50
[sil.] 

02:47:55
CRYSTER I, I guess pretty much the same. There, there is no, there is a certain… 

02:48:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Pretty much the same. 

02:48:00
CRYSTER …stagnant sameness. 

02:48:00
JEFFREY ZEIG A little lonely. 

02:48:05
CRYSTER Lonely, right, yeah and I mean and the people that are, I do have in my life is possible that some of them might give up, because they get tired of me. 

02:48:15
JEFFREY ZEIG You might get more lonely. 

02:48:15
CRYSTER Might get even more lonely. 

02:48:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah and are there people in your life who had been uh… giving you that feedback that you're hiding, that you're uh… 

02:48:25
CRYSTER Yeah. 

02:48:30
JEFFREY ZEIG …specific people that, did you have to mention them here, but specific people in your life? 

02:48:30
CRYSTER Yeah. 

02:48:30
JEFFREY ZEIG And if you think back… 

02:48:35
CRYSTER Yeah, I think it's been there. I think that uh… people are very nice to not kind of plunge in, but keeping, these are being kind of respectful in, in a funny way of that shield or that sort of mobility. 

02:49:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And, and that shield and that vulnerability, is that something that you come by honestly? 

02:49:05
CRYSTER Yes. 

02:49:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Do you understand my metaphor? 

02:49:05
CRYSTER Yeah. 

02:49:05
JEFFREY ZEIG What? 

02:49:10
CRYSTER How do I come by it honestly. 

02:49:10
JEFFREY ZEIG How do you come by it honestly? 

02:49:10
CRYSTER Well, in my understanding is that it goes way back to an early infant, who was uh… less than a year old and who was still breast-feeding his mother, who, and when the, my mother got really sick and went to the hospital, I went to a children's home and then a few years later, when my mother got really sick again, again I went for a long time for, like a six months to a children's home with uh… people in white uniforms and uh… and was this little kid who was quite alone and abandoned or and who kind of give up on trusting, that kind of closeness. 

02:50:00
JEFFREY ZEIG There is a feeling there. 

02:50:00
CRYSTER Yeah, there is a… 

02:50:05
JEFFREY ZEIG You come to this idea of trusting. Uh-huh! 

02:50:05
CRYSTER Yeah. 

02:50:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And… are those counterparts hiding, trusting? 

02:50:15
CRYSTER Are they counterparts? 

02:50:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Hiding, trusting. 

02:50:15
CRYSTER I think probably, probably yes. 

02:50:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Well, let's put that aside for just a minute and come back to it. What happens with your eyes when you, when you… we're just talking about trusting? 

02:50:35
CRYSTER Well, there is a willing forward of… 

02:50:40
JEFFREY ZEIG What was the willing? If that willing had words? 

02:50:40
CRYSTER Of, of sad, sadness but also sadness and numbness, I guess and almost like being injected with, with like uh… sleeping agent or something. 

02:50:55
[sil.] 

02:51:00
JEFFREY ZEIG I don't know, because it seemed like at that moment you were being more real and more in touch with whatever it was, where that process was going on with you and I was thinking just the opposite that there was a moment of being alive and enlightenment. Now, how are we doing at this moment with intimacy? You and I. 

02:51:30
CRYSTER Umm… I think we're doing okay. 

02:51:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Pretty good. 

02:51:35
CRYSTER I think so. 

02:51:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah! And that has something to do with trusting. It has something to do with trusting yourself. 

02:51:45
CRYSTER Mm-hmm! Right. 

02:51:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

02:51:45
CRYSTER Yes. 

02:51:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! And is it good, is it bad, is it indifferent what we're doing right now and by way of intimacy? 

02:52:00
CRYSTER This is, it's nice, it's, it's certainly not indifferent. 

02:52:05
JEFFREY ZEIG No. So it's nice, it's good. Uh-huh! And how do you sense what we're doing right now is good? 

02:52:15
CRYSTER Uh… I could sense that. 

02:52:20
JEFFREY ZEIG That was good. That's a good way of sensing it. 

02:52:25
CRYSTER Uh… how do I sense that it's good. 

02:52:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

02:52:30
CRYSTER Well, so, I, I do sense it in my body. 

02:52:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Yeah. And it could be a little welling(ph) in your eyes. 

02:52:40
CRYSTER Right. 

02:52:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And that could be a meaningful welling and being real. 

02:52:50
CRYSTER Right. 

02:52:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And you can trust that there is not the possibility in the world of my going. 

02:53:05
CRYSTER Okay. 

02:53:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And I would like to trust that there was no possibility in the world of you going to yourself. 

02:53:10
CRYSTER Of me going to myself. 

02:53:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, humiliating yourself or shaming yourself. 

02:53:20
CRYSTER Right. 

02:53:20
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, when I was uh… thinking about you come by at honestly, I was in a little different direction and your sharing something about your developmental history actually made me feel closer to you that you were open about that and I could imagine a child very wounded by comings and goings that probably wouldn't have made sense to uh… that age child. But, when I was thinking about coming by it honestly, hiding, I was thinking more about stereophonic influences like it could have come from one of two speakers or both speakers, either one or both of your parents. How did they hide? 

02:54:05
CRYSTER How did my parents… 

02:54:05
JEFFREY ZEIG How would they uh… umm… uh… avoidant to intimacy, if, if they were? 

02:54:10
CRYSTER Now they were, well, how were they avoidant? Well, that they umm…, they were pretty miserable and they were sick most of the way and they were intoxicated. 

02:54:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, that's one way of avoiding intimacy and it's another way of not understanding what would normal intimacy be. 

02:54:35
CRYSTER Right. 

02:54:35
JEFFREY ZEIG How would you know growing up with intoxicated parents what intimacy could be like? 

02:54:45
CRYSTER Right. 

02:54:45
JEFFREY ZEIG So your search for intimacy is uh… magnificent and your search for intimacy is a way of wanting to heal some childhood wounds. And that there are, you're married. 

02:55:05
CRYSTER Yes. 

02:55:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And you have children and that there are intimate moments that you have in your marriage. 

02:55:10
CRYSTER Right. 

02:55:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And intimate moments that you have with your children. And I imagine intimate moments that you have with colleagues. An intimate moments that you have with friends. 

02:55:20
CRYSTER Yes. 

02:55:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And these are all the ways of you exploring something that you were in privy to when you were growing up. 

02:55:30
CRYSTER Right. 

02:55:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It made me think about an aspect of my life, you know, my father was a postman. He delivered the mail in New York City for the first into my adolescence and very nice man, but never read a book and uh… was not educated, just kind and he could get me off of the launching pad, if you imagine a rocket, he could get me off of the launching pad indeed. But he really couldn't get me into the orbit that I thought I could aspire to and as I look back in my life, it's almost as if there is a little board of directors that I have in my mind and that I picked up father and mother magicians along the way that could orient me towards developing aspects of myself that couldn't have possibly been developed in my family of origin and Erickson and (inaudible ) and the ArchBishop of (inaudible ) that I met for some number of hours in Hong Kong. And is this little board of directors and all of those things helping me to get into the kind of orbit that I wanted to be in. Well, let's us meditate for a moment on this idea of trust. And think that one aspect of what you want to accomplish has something to do with trust. 

02:57:10
CRYSTER Right. 

02:57:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And just like we could envision 2 or 5 years, 10 years, 20 years into the future, let's envision 5 years, 10 years, 20 years in the future and now you have been and I swear you in as a private investigator of intimacy. 

02:57:30
[sil.] 

02:57:35
CRYSTER Okay. Okay. 

02:57:40
JEFFREY ZEIG This is so strange. I was just hallucinating a memory. I was in San Francisco, I was in graduate school and I was at Union Square and I was on a bus and about five rows in front of me, there is a mother and she has been taking things out of her umm… shopping bag and there is a daughter and she's showing the daughter and she's mixing things and matching things and I can't hear the conversation, but I thought that was just such a wonderful intimate parenting moment and I don't know why, but it was as if I took a picture of that even though it's more than 40 years ago and I remember it and this idea of being a private investigator of intimacy would be noticing those moments when they happen over the course of life which could be on television or in the bus or at a conference and just having a scrapbook where you would blink your eyes for a moment and memorize that and begin to build up an understanding of what normal intimacy could be. Okay, now let's being you into a future and now we're five years in the future and you are now a man who trusts and enjoys intimacy. So create a picture for me, of how I would know. I see you and like seeing this woman on a bus, I see you across the room and I think wow, there is a man who really understands intimacy. What would I be seeing? 

02:59:40
CRYSTER Umm… you would be seeing smiling. 

02:59:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha… 

02:59:50
CRYSTER Umm… physical closeness. 

02:59:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Aha… proximity. 

02:59:55
CRYSTER Someone who wouldn't move away but who would have the willingness and the readiness and the willingness really to move closer and to stay there. 

03:00:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

03:00:05
CRYSTER Not just move in and then out but that you would notice. Here is someone who really moves in and then he stays there. And in a relaxed comfortable… 

03:00:20
JEFFREY ZEIG So you're moving in, you're staying there, your body is relaxed and comfortable. 

03:00:25
CRYSTER And then that… 

03:00:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Smiling. 

03:00:25
CRYSTER …something can grow. 

03:00:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

03:00:30
CRYSTER And, and even and then that can happen again and again with even with the same where the same people, but it's not this quick in and out but someone that you notice that this person stays in the closeness. Enjoying that. 

03:00:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes and trust, trust seems to be part of that. Let's come back to that in a minute. You know, I'm a, I'm a glider pilot. I fly gliders. I've been doing this uh… since 1982. Stephen Gilligan came up with me once on my glider. And uh… when you're landing the glider, there is a kind of effect called the ground effect and you can fly the glider a long way without anything other than the fact that there is a ground effect. And the mentality that I've incorporated into my piloting is hold it off, hold it off, hold it off, hold it off, hold it off and in a very gentle low energy way, glider just lands itself. So this trust, this idea of uh… seeing you in the future and your staying there and you're moving toward and you're smiling. Your body is relaxed and you're enjoying the moment and where does trust come in? You trust that? 

03:02:10
CRYSTER Trust that. That it's good and that it… 

03:02:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Feels good. 

03:02:15
CRYSTER …that it's safe. 

03:02:20
JEFFREY ZEIG That you're safe. 

03:02:20
CRYSTER And that I won't be sort of umm… that nothing bad will happen, I guess. 

03:02:30
JEFFREY ZEIG That you cope adequately, that you'll deal adequately with whatever happens, right? And that what would you do uh… if you ashamed yourself? What would you do if somebody uh… humiliated you? It was a funny moment. I was just, you know having all of these flashbacks as we're talking and for a moment, I had done uh… uh… a lecture in South America. This is a long time ago, 20 years ago and I'm flying back and it was a night flight. We stopped in what was airways we stopped at San Diego. We went to Los Angeles. It's 10 O' clock in the morning. I'm just trying to get home and I'm thumbing through a copy of People magazine and this pharisaical, do you know pharisaical? 

03:03:25
CRYSTER No. 

03:03:25
JEFFREY ZEIG From the Pharisees, from the Bible, holding yourself endowed. This pharisaical man throws a copy of the Wall Street journal into my lap and he says read this, maybe you'll learn something. 

03:03:45
CRYSTER Right. 

03:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Now I thought at the moment of throwing my card into his lap and say, give this to your children, maybe they'll need something. But at, at the moment, I thought wow, what a great moment. I'm gonna remember this and some day, I'm gonna be talking to Cryster and I'm going to be using this moment and uh… of maintaining uh… my equanimity even though somebody was uh… having this kind of neural discharge, if you, if you went to the workshop the other day. Yeah, yeah, okay so now have we been doing about the fact that you've been subtly umm… escalating our level of intimacy and you seem to be joining me in the process? How are we doing right now as far as being intimate is concerned? 

03:04:40
CRYSTER I, it feels good, I feel a little vibration of uh… hesitation, I think. 

03:04:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, yes. And as Reed Wilson would say in talking about any anxiety disorder that one of the strategies is avoid avoidance and then use whatever techniques you have at your disposal to manage the energy. 

03:05:05
CRYSTER Okay. 

03:05:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Because avoiding avoidance, if you umm… avoid it's as if you're appeasing the little tyrant inside your heart and uh… appeasing tyrants makes them stronger and the tolerating and moving toward, but I want to be sure that they are moving toward part is that one you recognize that this is a way in which, you are finding out what's normal. 

03:05:40
CRYSTER Right. 

03:05:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And one of the ways that you're healing an old wound. And that your choice of a profession and intimacy, profession is another way that, another thing that you're doing to heal old wounds. And many times, our profession is a way of healing old wounds and that you're building up a repertoire and that you're doing something that's fun. Because if it's not fun, why should we bother to do it. And that you're doing something that's meaningful. 

03:06:15
[sil.] 

03:06:20
CRYSTER Yeah. Yeah. 

03:06:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And as you close your eyes, where is it that you go? 

03:06:30
CRYSTER I guess that, the fun and the meaningful and the certain uh… peaceful mourning kind of sadness is there. But, but restful. 

03:06:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Yes, very restful. Okay, so now, umm… this idea that I was talking about before about having the concept like intimacy is something that exists here and that we want to know I can be intimate and that's a big moment where suddenly, you realized that and the power that, that has to transform itself into I am an intimate person. But, that may take a little bit of doing to move from that place and uh… some of the things that we're talking about may be things that you find that are useful in, in that process. Now, what is it that you know about formal hypnosis? That something that could interest you at this moment? 

03:07:50
CRYSTER To talk about that. 

03:07:50
JEFFREY ZEIG No, to experience it. 

03:07:50
CRYSTER Oh, sure. 

03:07:55
JEFFREY ZEIG It is a big topic in my life. 

03:08:00
CRYSTER No, absolutely. 

03:08:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, what, what have you experienced previously about trance? 

03:08:05
CRYSTER It's usually… sitting back and going inside. 

03:08:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh, sitting back and going inside. Uh-huh and you have a way in which you allow yourself to now sit back and to allow yourself to make some adjustments like taking in easy breath and letting yourself settle in to orientations, center into a posture and it can be Cryster just a moment of hesitation and just a moment in which you can be aware and even a bit weary. And you can be thinking to yourself, "Do I really want to entrust this moment?" 

03:09:10
[sil.] 

03:09:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And so it can be as if you wait and hesitate and begin to think to yourself. It can really be okay to grow, to go inside. And that there can be something that's essentially healing about using the capacity of trance. Because you know that there is so many different kinds of tears and it could be tears of rage. 

03:09:55
[sil.] 

03:10:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And it could be tears of anger. 

03:10:05
[sil.] 

03:10:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And it could be tears of hurt. Tears of pain and it could be tears of shame and tears of guilt. And there can be tears of joy and tears of relief. And there can be tears of intimacy and there can be the kind of tears that wash away old hurts. So many different kinds of tears. 

03:11:00
[sil.] 

03:11:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And then as you sense, it's okay to move forward. Then you can nod your head to me so that I know that it's okay to move forward. Take as much time as you need and test it and that's a different kind of head movement, more of the unconscious variety of experience. And using trance, it's a way in which you can get to better know yourself 

03:11:45
[sil.] 

03:11:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And so you allow some rhythms to slow down. You may allow yourself to focus for example, you don't have to use my voice as a way of focusing and you can use my voice as a way of focusing. And it could somehow feel to you as if you can resonate with my voice and entrust my voice to guide you. 

03:12:35
[sil.] 

03:12:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And that allowing some changes to happen, a sense of well-being that can begin to mature inside you. A way in which time can change and seem different. 

03:13:05
[sil.] 

03:13:10
JEFFREY ZEIG A way in which your conscious mind can orient towards my voice, so that you can entrust, entrust the capacity of your inner mind to guide you. So that you have an adequate experience of trance comfort. Knowing that any time that you want to, any time that you want to increase your own sense of comfort. Curiously, you can open your eyes 

03:13:55
[sil.] 

03:14:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And allow yourself to focus and be in a trance with your eyes wide open and enjoy the way in which there can be interesting changes, changes in your head movement, changes in your orientation. And that's wonderful experience to have a moment of being in trance with your eyes wide open. And your body can be very limp and tingling. Your mind can be alert and present in very pleasant way. And what is it like now, to allow yourself to be in an eyes open trance? 

03:15:00
CRYSTER It's a bit giddy. 

03:15:00
JEFFREY ZEIG A little giddy. Uh-huh, yeah. It's a nice feeling. 

03:15:05
CRYSTER Yeah. Tingly, giddy. 

03:15:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Tingly giddy, yeah. And your body can be tingling and relatively passive, relatively at ease and your mind can be alert. And you can uh… take this moment, take another easy breath and then close your eyes and move a little bit forward into trance, a little bit deeper into trance. And that can be a very pleasant sensation. And it can be as if somehow the capacity of trance allows you to entrust the capacity of your own inner mind with taking a snapshot of that giddiness and taking a snapshot of what it's like to be here with me in a trance with your eyes wide open. 

03:16:10
[sil.] 

03:16:15
JEFFREY ZEIG With ease, you take that breath and allow your body to enjoy being comfortable. Very nice changes by smile or clarity to your facial uh… muscles, a way in which facial muscles smooth out and are at ease. 

03:16:45
[sil.] 

03:16:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And that you really have the concept of what it's like to go into trance. 

03:17:00
[sil.] 

03:17:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I can remember uh… a moment reference experience, I was teaching, it was my first class. I was teaching introductory psychology to graduate student in the university. And on Monday the first day of class in the sea of ADM, 18 year old students, there was one woman in her 40s and she was looking at me and seem to have uh… a very pursed lips and a strident expression on her face and I thought I did a terrible lecture. And on Tuesday, she wasn't there and I thought, I was great and on Wednesday, I saw those pursed lips again and that strident expression and that was terrible. Thursday, she wasn't there. On Friday, again she was there and uh… I talked that morning with my major professor and I told him exactly what was happening and he looked at me in an astonished way and kind of strident way and nice strident way and he said, "You know, something about hypnosis." And I said, "Yeah." And he said, "Well, what do people look like when they go into a trance?" And I thought, "Oh!" And he said, "You know something about hypnosis." "Yeah." And in a kind way he said, "Well, you can use what you know." 

03:19:05
[sil.] 

03:19:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And in just a moment, I'm going to ask you to begin to reorient yourself and to begin to bring yourself back here. Is that all right? Okay and then I invite you to bring yourself back here and take one or two or three easy breaths. Take one or two or three easy breaths and then reorient yourself and bring yourself back here, fully alert and how was that? 

03:19:45
CRYSTER It's good. 

03:19:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Good? What was good about it? 

03:19:50
CRYSTER Umm… there was some certain airiness and expansiveness and lightness about it. 

03:19:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Very light, lightness in your expansiveness. And could trance be an intimate moment? 

03:20:05
CRYSTER Absolutely. 

03:20:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Absolutely. 

03:20:05
CRYSTER Absolutely. 

03:20:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And it was okay. 

03:20:10
CRYSTER It was okay. 

03:20:10
JEFFREY ZEIG More than okay, it was airy. It was really nice. Uh-huh! Okay, so, uh… what is your sense of our trajectory like, I've been prodding you sometimes this way to uh… avoid avoidance and to be with me and to feel that you and I are having this umm… more intimate moment and, what's it like? 

03:20:40
CRYSTER Umm… so, so there is an experience of the, of myself of, there is a resistance that is there, but I can't pinpoint it, it's like, there is a resistance and yet I don't feel a need to be resistant. It's almost like, it's like, it's puzzling, but there is a sense that is there a resistance or is there not a resistance? I think you have a sense that there is a resistance about… 

03:21:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Well, let me say, how I would experience it, if you had a broken arm for example, you need a cast and when your arm is been in a cast for a long time, then you can imagine that it could be free range of motion, but your arm has been in a cast for a while and so doing what you could imagine yourself doing is not easy, because your habit is having your arm in a cast. 

03:21:35
CRYSTER Right. 

03:21:40
JEFFREY ZEIG And so then, there needs to be a kind of range of motion, exercises, and then gradually, you're increasing the range of motion and gradually, you have the freedom to be able to move in any direction that you want, but it would be unwise to go from here to here. 

03:22:00
CRYSTER Right. 

03:22:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And it would take a few steps to be able to do that. Now, it could be that for example, there is little bing, bing, bing, a little warning went off in your mind that suddenly there would be the orientation of use what you know. And that would be a way of avoiding avoidance and it would be a way of managing at the moment whatever immediate tension was, because when we talked about the price that you'd have to pay to stay and when we talk about the possibilities of airiness and building trust and finding out what is normal and doing something that's fun and doing something that's meaningful and healing old wounds, that sounds much more inviting. 

03:23:00
CRYSTER Right. Mm-hmm! 

03:23:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

03:23:05
CRYSTER Yes. Mm-hmm! 

03:23:05
JEFFREY ZEIG So come back to that uh… and then we need to stop, because of time and but come back to that picture, right that you're envisioning yourself into your future and you've gotten the concept, I can be intimate and you've turn that into the belief. I will be intimate. And you turn that into the state. I'm being intimate. And you morph that into the identity, I am an intimate person. So help me to see that picture as you may develop that picture, as you may embroider that picture and make it more three dimensional, make it more come alive in your future, one year, two years, five years from now. Help me to see it. 

03:24:00
CRYSTER What was it? 

03:24:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Help me to see it, help me to… 

03:24:00
CRYSTER When there is, an airiness, an effortlessness uh… a softness and a freedom to, freedom to meander. 

03:24:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Freedom to meander, yeah. 

03:24:15
CRYSTER Into that territory. 

03:24:15
JEFFREY ZEIG A little giddy and trusting. 

03:24:20
CRYSTER Meander and being that student curious about intimacy, having the history that I have and that's absolutely fine. It is the way, it is, but yet meandering perhaps as an anthropologist into your country. 

03:24:40
JEFFREY ZEIG A private investigator or being an anthropologist, seeing what it's like, because my sense of you is that there is an orbit that you're capable of that unfortunately your parents might not have been able to aspire to, but that you get it and that you are not somebody who is just going to allow yourself to stay in the force of habit, but that you can see that there is airiness and giddiness and value, meaning in pursuing this goal. Bless you. 

03:25:20
CRYSTER Thank you. 

03:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much for working with me. Is that okay? 

03:25:25
CRYSTER Absolutely. 

03:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG We're okay if we are stopping that now? 

03:25:25
CRYSTER Yeah, thank you. 

03:25:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes! 

03:25:30
[sil.] 

03:25:40
JEFFREY ZEIG I completely lost time. I have no conception of where we were. 

03:25:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Hi. 

03:25:50
CRYSTER Hi. 

03:25:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Almost don't want to get up here and interrupt your… 

03:26:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Did I smile more? now we're happy, this loved man's didn't… 

03:26:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

03:26:05
CRYSTER Yes. 

03:26:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I feel like three is a crowd here. Umm… but that was great. That was just fantastic and really hope that you can see me as a client when I need therapy. 

03:26:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, I said the same for you. Yeah. 

03:26:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, for those, guiding the bowl, Ericksonian sort of wanting them more authentic Erickson session, I think this was pretty close. Umm… I, I would just comment and maybe briefly on more of the macro steps that I saw that in terms of, is it Chris, Christopher? 

03:26:55
CRYSTER Cryster. 

03:26:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Christopher, yeah where are you from? 

03:26:55
CRYSTER Sweden. Well, I'm from Boston. 

03:27:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh Sweden, yeah, yeah. But you were born and raised in Sweden. 

03:27:05
CRYSTER Yes. 

03:27:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, you know, what the Norwegian say about the Swedes? 

03:27:10
CRYSTER I don't think, I want to know. 

03:27:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Swedes also say about the Norwegians, so you probably know this. 

03:27:15
CRYSTER That's right. Why Norwegians are the last to take vacation? 

03:27:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Why? 

03:27:20
CRYSTER It's too expensive to have them retrained. 

03:27:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN No, I was talking about, I always heard about the Norwegian who loved his wife so much, he almost told her. 

03:27:35
[sil.] 

03:27:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, your turn. 

03:27:45
CRYSTER It's good. 

03:27:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But, umm… to me, I mean, my, by first listening and the conversation is what is it that you want to experientially realize like and I think Christopher was pretty clear, right out at the starting gate umm… I really would like assistance in intimacy and so what, what really was umm… most impressive and stood out uh… was this macro level of one, one of the differences that I had noticed in Jeff, it's not that he was disconnected last time, but he had a full intense, sustained connection with Christopher the whole time. I hope you noticed that he was just leaning in and so you know, Jeff talks about uh… creating experiences in psychotherapy around what it is of course, that needs, wants to be able to learn in the world and that was, that was about as good an example of that, you know, he had that sort of Erickson ocular gaze with a smile. So and, and so umm… Christopher really, it, it felt to me like everything that you were feeling and experiencing, communicating was in this sustained intimate connection with Jeff, you know, a professional intimacy that was there. And after that happened, the Jeff then invited Christopher with the, the formal trance stuff to go inside and to develop that same sustained intimacy with himself So umm… you know, one of the things uh… that I saw Jeff doing in both sessions is asking the client to project umm… on to him as the therapist uh… their goal, their problem, their process. Uh… tell me what it's about, if you're, what was it? Was it private investigator. 

03:29:50
JEFFREY ZEIG No, if he was sent on vacation and he had to coach me to do a lack of intimacy, how would I do it? 

03:30:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right, and it's the same thing, you know, we saw this morning in terms of tell me, you know, how I'd be standing and, and so forth. So… you know, this is uh… Michael White used to call as externalizing. Umm… it's something that I think that trance work especially supports where you can have this therapeutic disassociation, if you will umm… and Jeff seems to uh… use it a lot in terms of bring it on to me and then uh… I'll be a good mirror inviting you to, to reclaim that within yourself. So, that's really what I was seeing at the macro level. And just, you know, the other thing is, this word intimacy of course has so many different meanings and one of the things that Erickson used to talk about repeatedly, I mean, I came to see Erickson originally as a student of Danler, Danler and Grinder(ph) who Ericson called Bandler and Grinder and later called Bandade and swindler. And we're talking about his fierceness. Umm… for about two years, uh… every morning that I was sitting in the Erickson's office waiting for him. When he came out, he would look at me with that ocular gaze, he wasn't smiling and he would say, "Bandler and Grinder assigned definite rigid values to human behavior and you can't do that, because values change." And then like Jeff was demonstrating, he would tell these stories about the way he had lost a toy, a favorite toy when he was six. And he thought that there would be no tomorrow. And at seven when he remembered that it was a stupid toy that he never liked in the first place. As a 19 year old psychology student, he looked at with intellectual curiosity and he moves up to just recently, I remember that same thing with affection for that young boy who lost that toy. So this word intimacy has to change throughout their life cycle, what it means, what it looks like, how you express it, how you experience it, so forth and so on. And so we're looking at what does intimacy look look like for you now which he was asking. And now, let's create some experiences where in an Ericksonnian term, what a nice thing to know that you can experience intimacy in so many different ways. So that is the opening of the loosening of the what my friend calls hardening of the categories into say, it looks like this therefore I don't want to do it or I can't do it. If I have to do it in that matter of way, what we're doing in psychotherapy in general, in trance in particular is opening this more fluid space. So we can keep moving through intimacy can look like this, I can respond like this. To each part of the sequence of intimacy, so I think you just saw a uh… wonderful conversation that illustrated that. 

03:33:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Mm-hmm! Okay! Yeah. Yeah so from my side of the equation umm… it's like, I can remember my own fears of intimacy. I can remember how I perceived it developmentally. I can remember being in a place where I enjoy intimacy. Well, first being, I tolerated then being in a place where I can really enjoy it. So I was also referencing my own developmental history and knowing that, that's something that was part of my life and uh… umm… so it was a combination like there was cognitive things, there were behavioral things, there were hypnotic things, there was informational things, there was uh… experiential things. There was anecdotal things so it was, it was a uh… pot pourri of different orientations and probably, because Cryster is umm… professional and more uh… you know, more attuned to cognitive learning's that I was more cognitive than I might have been in other situations. But the umm… you know, it's a kind of unusual, because when I learn that a (inaudible ) model to do therapy for the first time, it was that the patient needed to talk more than the therapist and the therapist needed to establish conditions through which the uh… patient would explore himself, the client would explore himself. And then the idea of being more aggressive and more active and understanding that intimacy is a state and that hypnosis is a state and that if we can use hypnosis to help people to transform states, intimacy is a state that we can also develop experiential methods to help people to realize what it is that they're designed to do. We're all designed for intimacy and certainly lots of tragedies get in the way and prevent us from reaching the trajectory that we want and can we help to smooth the paths, so that it becomes a little bit easier for Cryster to see what he was initially designed to do. Children are designed to be intimate and uh… uh… so uh… how can we create this moment that uh… is safe, it's what for, what else we'd call the safe emergency and uh… that, this would be umm… some reference and can't keep track of all of the stories and can't keep track of uh… all of the metaphors and all of the actions, but the sum total of all of those things is synergistic and no one of them is uh… going to be completely curative, but the totality of that and then it's just having the faith that you can work with somebody who seems stuck in a state and help them to get out of that state into a more adaptive state and that we have a technology for helping people to change their state and that's derived from hypnosis, but doesn't need to definitively use hypnosis. In the induction umm… it would have been easier for me, if I had written down some of the steps of that initial way of having the problem. So… what I was doing technically is that I was trying to use the induction as a metaphor of the solution, so to have the problem that the client does TTT, and to do an induction, you could do TTTT… ah… so that the structure of the induction could harness and reframe the steps of the problem and lead into a more adaptive place and I couldn't keep track of all of the factors just because I wasn't capable of doing it in my own mind but that's what I had in mind in doing that induction and then the many kind of tears, right this is like when you, it's like saying to your partner, oh, let's go out to dinner. Okay, so that's a good idea that we go out to dinner and then maybe you would like to go for Italian food. And I don't know maybe you prefer to go for some kind of Asian food and maybe it would be the Thai food would be something good. So why don't we just go out for Thai food and it's like going through a menu and seeing how the person is responding to the menu but also having a strategic landing place for that pattern which by the way was something that I didn't invent. I picked up from Erickson. And uh… it's something that was one of those little tinker toys that I have my repertoire that I could return to at other times in the futures. So, it takes one particular uh… talent to invent an orientation and then another to find an adequate place to use that orientation. So that was where that sequence came from but I, I knew where I was going within the steps of that sequence about the tear. And now, and that, that, that there are so many uh… type of tears and there are important tears and intimate tears and those are good tears. 

03:39:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN This uh… reiteration of what Jeff is saying about trying to find the structure or the sequence of the problem and they see not only your induction but any suggested solution on that structure that they are using and the reason here is practical because that's the condition pattern that has been laid downs. So probabilistically, it is the most likely sequence that will activate in that person's area of their experience. So if that is the what is most likely to automatically operate, we want to build our solution around that so to speak and then what guides us is this core Erickson idea that each point in the sequence, the same structure, the same pattern could be negative or could be positive depending on your connection to it. So we don't have to think, we have to get rid of the negative, we have to bring our human presence to that point that had been negative to claim that as positive. But we are just always thinking whatever they have been doing for a long time in their past, that's what is least likely to change in their future. So we want to harness everything to that so that we can make use of it. 

03:40:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Open utilization, strategy. Let's see what thoughts, questions, comments, perspectives, you have from uh…, we have from the audience? That was perfectly clear? 

03:40:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Stimulated. 

03:40:45
JEFFREY ZEIG I have been known to be perfectly clear. 

03:40:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And uh…, we, we'll go over here. You guys have to stand up when you talk and introduce yourself, share your deepest secret and then ask the question. 

03:41:00
UNKNOWN My name is Carlyn (ph.) from Ontario, Canada. Umm… I'm really new to this. It seemed to me that you did a post hypnotic suggestion in the form of a story and I love that and the other thing is in my past (inaudible ) studies, you used what's called the incluesio, I don't know, whether that was intentional or not where you repeated certain words at the end of the therapy that recalled at least to my mind stories and pieces from earlier on in the therapy which facilitates remembering and seems to capital. It seemed, you were very intent on wanting uh… Christopher to take something home. 

03:41:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, to close the loop. So at that moment, I wasn't even being a therapist, I was being the scriptwriter. And I had the idea that in script writing no hanging threads and so then things that you had seeded along the way get tied up at the end and if you can remember what those things are and, and punctuate them with a, with closure, I think it has more emotional impacts and more, more meaning. So I really aspire to do that in my work because by the way it worked for Sophocles, worked for Shakespeare and it worked with Spielberg and the techniques that I see that artists use because they are the experts in having emotional impact in helping people change their mood and perspectives so much better than psychotherapists so that idea that a story is the prime and William James said that a prime is something that awakens a representation and that as you awaken that representation, you begin to build it and then tie up to something and umm… uh… have it uh… available for potential future use whether or not that's conscious or unconscious. That we know that priming is a socio evolutionary, biological effect and that it's part of our humanity and one of the very few people in history before the concept of priming was invented in social psychology, Milton Erickson was using it probably because Shakespeare and Sophocles used it and he was an avid reader and he found these methodologies and he was a dramatist and he would be very good at principles from drama like you know, in Shakespeare or in Spielberg, there are no wastage scenes. Every scene has to advance the story. And that leaving hanging threads is a bad idea and that if you have a character come in against an emotional background, when you come back to that emotional background future in the novel, you have to have that character reappear because otherwise, you have a hanging threat. Let's try to close those hanging threads, so I look for opportunities to learn from artists and include some of that methodology in developing myself as a communicator. Yep. 

03:44:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And, and I would like to say, that general question or value or therapy that's driving that is not the traditional question of what's wrong with this person but how is it that they can lead a creative life. So when, when we're thinking around that second question, then we're thinking in terms of narratives and so then we're thinking in terms of all the different parts of the story that will allow a full life. So that the Ericksonnian contextual difference about shifting from a problem focus to the solution focus gives rise to this different way of thinking for therapists. 

03:45:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Are you okay, on this, the way that we're talking. 

03:45:00
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

03:45:05
UNKNOWN Umm… hi. Umm… I was so impressed by the umm… the elegance with which you went right towards umm… going to the places that were disconnected in him and weaving right that right back in as resources that he was already doing without knowing that he did it. 

03:45:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm a little bit hard of hearing, so I didn't get all the words that you said, especially at the end. 

03:45:30
UNKNOWN The resources in him that he was disconnected with that he was doing without already knowing that he was doing it. For example, all the tears you included and you may see among everything else. So, it was all a cohesive hold and then umm… several points you really uh… weaved the idea of trust. 

03:45:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

03:45:55
UNKNOWN By entrusting his capacities and I, I just felt that was masterful. 

03:46:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you. That's very nice of you to say. Umm… yeah the uh… we have to know that I have to know and I have to believe that if I had Cryster's problem that I could solve it. So I'm not going to work until I know that if I had this problem, I could solve it. So I have to know something about the structure of the problem and then okay, I could, if I had this problem, I could fix, I could solve it. And then I have to know second that Cryster has a resource in his own history that I can appeal to and although, Cryster in his mind maybe thinking I'm a person who avoids intimacy, I have to be thinking that as a professional who works in the mental health field and as a married man with a child that he has more umm… uh… resources for intimacy than he's giving himself credit for and then the third piece of that is that I have to know that I can utilize whatever is immediately present to help him to actualize those resources. So it's three types of faith. Faith one, if I had this problem, I could solve it. Don't go further than that, if you can't. Faith number two, the person has a resource in their own history and faith number three, I can utilize something that exists in the totality of the situation to help this person to access those resources. Three kinds of faith Okay, one more and then maybe we'll stop. 

03:47:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I would love to just hear anything that Christopher would like to share. 

03:47:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Sure. So let's just take this gentleman's question first and then we'll end with that. 

03:47:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

03:47:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, I think so. 

03:47:55
UNKNOWN If he know… 

03:48:00
UNKNOWN How did he know 

03:48:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry, this is also being recorded so. 

03:48:05
UNKNOWN Oh, how did he know that he was taken away from his mother's breasts too soon? My got, my thinking got clouded when I heard him say that. 

03:48:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, so we, I don't know and there are so many story lines that can be developed in the course of the session. So you, so you have to pick and choose which story lines because there are so many roads to home and that story line itself could have gotten us into a very good place if we would pursue it but whether, whether or not it's true in a political sense or true in the emotional sense or the mythological sense umm… you know, I wasn't thinking to pursue that particular path. I was thinking that there would be uh… a path of what Stephen was saying which was to maintain and increase the tighter of intimacy in the moment and that is uh… a Gestault principle whatever the problem is bring it into the moment. And we spend a lot of time talking like gossip, you know, like the patient brings in their intimacy and it's a triangular conversation and we're talking about the intimacy as if it existed out there not in the basic externalized way that Michael White would recommend but in a way that we're gossiping about the problem rather than living the moment and being in the moment, bringing the problem or the solution into the moment and building on that. So I wasn't, although that rabbit hole might have gotten us somewhere, I just wasn't. 

03:49:55
UNKNOWN Right. I wouldn't have played into that but it was like, his Spielberg writing that story by saying that. t's not necessarily was it true, it's just some story he picked up and he's reiterating. 

03:50:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It could be, but it didn't seem relevant to the session. 

03:50:15
JEFFREY ZEIG At this moment that didn't seem relevant to me. It might have been relevant to you, if you were doing the session and you could have gone along with it, so I, I don't know. 

03:50:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, let's, let's hear from, hear from the horse's mouth. 

03:50:30
UNKNOWN So is that, the greatest image that I'm left with right now is this that closeness and almost that magnetic force field that was, I wasn't going to say that you created or maybe that we created. 

03:50:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, we created. 

03:50:55
UNKNOWN Yes. So, so and so the closeness and the steadfastness of that, so that's a powerful image and for a reason, I don't know, the other image was that the landing of that plane and that was kind of mesmerizing in of itself and, and sort of beauty to that, I don't know why exactly that grabbed me but it, but it did. And uh… yeah. 

03:51:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that now was his goal, right sustained connection. That's the experiential image that he's carrying away. 

03:51:30
UNKNOWN Right, right. 

03:51:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Thank you so much. 

03:51:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

03:51:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Richard. 

03:51:40
RICHARD Hi. 

03:51:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Good to see you. 

03:51:40
RICHARD What's your name? 

03:51:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN My name, you can calm me Ale or you can call me George. Just call me. 

03:51:50
RICHARD Okay, Ale. 

03:51:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What a great smile you have. 

03:52:00
RICHARD Thanks. 

03:52:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Recall upon that at certain points in, in the work. 

03:52:05
RICHARD Absolutely. 

03:52:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So, you, you may remember uh… when Anika and I were working this morning, I suggested that we just take a few moments just to settle down, begin to open umm… a good holding space and uh… I am curious for, for you as I was for her. When, when you need to do that in your life do you have a favorite way of doing that? 

03:52:35
RICHARD Yes. Usually, I simply close my eyes and take a couple of breaths. 

03:52:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Let's, let's try that. And if you were to do this sort of the group trance, you all can uh… join in if you'd like, what would happen as we close our eyes, take a deep breath. What, what happens next, Richard? 

03:53:05
RICHARD Oh, I feel the very calm. 

03:53:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Feeling of calm. 

03:53:10
RICHARD And, and peace. 

03:53:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN A feeling of calm. 

03:53:15
RICHARD And peacefulness, yes. 

03:53:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And peace. I'm just curious if there was one image that your unconscious would send up or bring into your awareness that would be a nice guiding image or resource image in the work today. Just notice anything that your inner creative self would just give you as a gift. 

03:53:55
RICHARD Mm-hmm. 

03:54:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

03:54:00
RICHARD Do you want me to tell? 

03:54:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

03:54:05
RICHARD Umm… talking to Jeffrey, I was telling him how much I also loved to be in gliders and so the image, I got that we were talking was lifting and soaring. 

03:54:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You were, sorry I didn't quite hear. 

03:54:20
RICHARD I said, I was talking to Jeffrey about, he's a pilot of gliders. I'm not a pilot but I've been in them a number of times and I love it and so you asked what was the image The image for me was lifting and gliding. 

03:54:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow. You, you didn't tell you're, when he took me up, I said just don't turn the plane upside down. 

03:54:40
RICHARD And he did that. 

03:54:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So he retraumatized me telling the client that story. So any other image your unconscious give you that will be retraumatizing for me? 

03:54:50
RICHARD Believe it or not simply a blue light like blue coming through a stained glass. 

03:55:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. 

03:55:00
RICHARD That's cool. 

03:55:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Now I was in Barcelona uh… last month and uh… first time I was inside the Gowdy (ph.) uh… church, that's the God uh… familiar. Ever been there? 

03:55:10
RICHARD No. 

03:55:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The most beautiful place, church I've ever been in. Okay, so with that as a starting point feeling of being light and taking off in a blue light, let's open our eyes again. I'm gonna invite you in as straight forward and sincere way as, as you can to uh… ask three requests, to say, what, what you would like to ask for me in terms of our work, five words or less which you would like to ask of your own self and which you would like to ask of the community? 

03:56:05
RICHARD What I'd like to ask from you, I know, be there first and foremost is your support and I also want to ask from you guidance and a change in how I deal with a perception, a perception that I have of umm… resentment. 

03:56:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right Well, you're talking to an Irishman. We're experts in resentments. Come to the right person. 

03:56:45
RICHARD My best friend was an Irishman. 

03:56:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Who, who me or him? Me, me, thank you for letting us know that. Is, is that help things? Okay. 

03:57:00
RICHARD Is it better now? 

03:57:05
[sil.] 

03:57:10
RICHARD I don't know. Is that better? There you go. 

03:57:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is that better for me? 

03:57:15
RICHARD Yes. Okay. 

03:57:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay. Thank you please continue to. 

03:57:15
RICHARD Do you want me recount what I just… 

03:57:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

03:57:20
RICHARD Do you want me to restate what I said to you? 

03:57:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, from the very first about the blue light and uh… 

03:57:25
RICHARD I have to go down to New Orleans for that. Umm… I said that right from Stephen, something I knew would be there which is support and I wanted guidance from him specifically to the structure, the frame change whatever. My umm… preliction for resentment when someone close to me in some way or other hurts me usually with words. 

03:58:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Got it and of yourself? 

03:58:10
RICHARD I want to be open, receptive and real. 

03:58:20
[sil.] 

03:58:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And of the community? 

03:58:40
RICHARD I'd like to be heard and supported and somehow I don't know how you do this but encouraged. 

03:58:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Did you say… 

03:58:55
RICHARD Encouraged. 

03:59:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great Richard what I would like to ask of myself is to umm… listen from the vulnerability of every part of me with an open heart. 

03:59:25
[sil.] 

03:59:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what I would ask of you is to share some of your bulk heartedness. 

03:59:55
[sil.] 

04:00:00
RICHARD Okay. 

04:00:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what I would ask of the group is this is a sort of a slightly different version of Jeff's first point that he was making at the end is that any woundedness that you hear wound uh… Richard share, let it find your own woundedness and see what it means to just create a loving place for it, to be inside of you and as a place to hold that opportunity for Richard to do the same. 

04:00:45
[sil.] 

04:01:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And you got such a deep presence in your heart. 

04:01:25
RICHARD When uh… you asked yourself and this time in, in previous sessions, I've heard you say that the wounded part of you, you said the word wounded. And that got me and in the past, I've… 

04:01:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry, sorry before I, I just couldn't help but feel a connection when you said that. So I just wanted to say welcome. 

04:02:00
RICHARD Welcome to the walking wounded, eh. 

04:02:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know, I used to be do uh… ref, you know, Robert Ply(ph) the, the (inaudible ) used to do the myth poetic men's community. You do, you did? 

04:02:20
RICHARD No, I didn't do it. I mean… 

04:02:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN He's still alive, right. 

04:02:20
RICHARD I think. 

04:02:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. And umm… one of the things he used to say in her men's communities was traditionally uh… in traditional cultures that wouldn't allow the young men to have leadership positions because they weren't wounded enough. So they didn't know the sort of the initiatory humanness of being wounded. 

04:02:55
RICHARD Well, I, I resonate with that because I've been told by colleagues uh… who had been in a supervisory role with me that I use my woundedness, my damage very well with my clients. 

04:03:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So on a scale of one to ten, how much do you feel its presence right now? 

04:03:20
RICHARD Uh… it's seven. 

04:03:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Seven. Where do you most feel it in? 

04:03:25
RICHARD And in my stomach but here. 

04:03:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great and on a scale of one to ten, how much do you feel your unwoundedness? 

04:03:35
RICHARD Three. Three or four. 

04:03:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great Where do you most feel your unwoundedness? You know what I mean? No I mean like. 

04:03:45
RICHARD Oh. 

04:03:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know like somebody can be like, blah-blah-blah and they see their three year old grandchild and just all of the stuff disappears. 

04:04:00
RICHARD My dogs. 

04:04:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Your dogs. 

04:04:05
RICHARD My dogs. 

04:04:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great. I'm glad I asked. Now how many dogs do you have? 

04:04:10
RICHARD Two, Airedales. 

04:04:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Airedales May I ask their names? 

04:04:15
RICHARD Yeah. Quincy and somebody, some name, you know, Zoey. 

04:04:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh, yeah! Where did you come up with that name? 

04:04:25
RICHARD Uh… Zoey just came out of the air but I know when you came up with Zoey. 

04:04:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well actually my, my ex-wife had, it had came in a dream twice. 

04:04:35
RICHARD No kidding. 

04:04:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And uh… I couldn't argue with two dreams. Really, so Zoey and Quincy. How old are they? 

04:04:50
RICHARD Quincy is six and Zoey is in amazing 12. 

04:04:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow. 

04:04:55
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:04:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't that interesting that when you just make that connection, it seems like whatever pain or suffering or problems or what you have to change or what you're resentful about for a moment disappears? 

04:05:15
RICHARD Yes. 

04:05:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Am I right about that? 

04:05:15
RICHARD Yes, and the other thing that does a similar thing to me is music. 

04:05:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Ah. What kind of music? 

04:05:20
RICHARD Mostly, all kind but I, I love classical music and I, I love ballads. 

04:05:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry, ballads? 

04:05:30
RICHARD Ballads in classical music. 

04:05:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What kind of ballads? Irish, English, Scottish? 

04:05:35
RICHARD Any of the above. No, really umm… 

04:05:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What is petrosis, is that Italian? 

04:05:40
RICHARD It's, it's a forgery, because it should be Petruccione P-E-T-R-U-C-C-I-O-N-E and when I was one and a half, my father and his brother, my uncle had a business and they shortened it. Now, I don't know this is anything to Italian changing their name, but for business purposes. 

04:06:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What do you mean by that? 

04:06:15
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:06:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So how do you find time for holding resentments with all these connections? 

04:06:25
RICHARD You'd be surprised. 

04:06:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Try me. But am I hearing correctly that there is sort of like two different states. 

04:06:40
RICHARD Two different states? 

04:06:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Two different states like when you're with your dogs uh… you listen some great music that life is good. 

04:06:45
RICHARD Oh, yes. 

04:06:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That yeah, of course, I've been mistreated but something even more basic in what's been done to me. 

04:07:00
RICHARD Right. 

04:07:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But the, the beauty of the world, of the love, the unconditional love that. Dogs are my favorite living being too. 

04:07:10
RICHARD Me too, me too. 

04:07:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right, my last conscious act of the day is I go outside when I'm home is I sit in my California hot tub outside, it's obligatory for me and then I have my dog Marley. And then I bring him upstairs and lay her down in the bed and I. I sit there and, and just have a trance connection with her. 

04:07:35
RICHARD I know something like that. 

04:07:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know that, right. 

04:07:35
RICHARD Now, you just sit in there presence and you just gaze at them and something happens. 

04:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah. That's, that's great. What, what kind of music comes to mind? 

04:07:50
RICHARD Right now, Mozart. 

04:07:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Mozart. Yeah and how far all around you do you feel that love and that beauty of music and that say stop. 

04:08:00
RICHARD It's expanding now, it's expanding as we, it continues to. 

04:08:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, and on a scale of one to ten, how much do you, do you feel that? 

04:08:20
RICHARD At least five or six. 

04:08:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you have any predictions about the best ways that you will increase that? Are you a betting man? 

04:08:35
RICHARD No, not actually. Umm… 

04:08:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN so. 

04:08:40
RICHARD But I think I would increase that by being able, be confident that I don't have to feel as easily damaged and then resentful. 

04:08:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… well that sounds like umm… a good thought that you thought of. 

04:08:55
RICHARD Yes. 

04:09:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Just you know, if you were to hire me as a consultant and you asked me for my level of confidence that, that would be helpful, I'd say about a one. 

04:09:15
RICHARD About one. I don't think so. I'm glad, I'm here for, for myself. 

04:09:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I, I just sort of, I missed you all of a sudden, it seemed like you, you are in this beautiful state, your connection with your dog. 

04:09:30
RICHARD Right. 

04:09:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And with Mozart and, and then when you had the question in what ways could this increase, I, I felt you sort of disappeared. Right, I know from martial arts, you, you all of a sudden became very vulnerable. 

04:09:50
RICHARD Yeah. I also was a bit baffled about responding to the question. 

04:09:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. I, I get that. So maybe we try a little experiment which is to see if you'd drop the question through your body almost like a pebble being dropped into a pond and to see like ripples, just to notice in the same way that you'd be listening to music or feeling the basic beautiful connection when you're walking your dogs or just hanging out with Quincy and Zoey. 

04:10:40
RICHARD In my body. 

04:10:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:10:40
RICHARD What I would experience is umm… an expansion of my ease of breathing and getting more air which is one of my struggles. 

04:10:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. That's great. 

04:10:55
RICHARD But that, when I'm feeling at my best, that's just opened up. 

04:11:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And just for FYI, for your information. 

04:11:05
RICHARD Is that what that means? 

04:11:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry and you feel to me when you, whatever you did both more vulnerable and more strong at the same time. I, I really. 

04:11:25
RICHARD That's curious. 

04:11:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Enjoy our, our connection. 

04:11:25
RICHARD Me too. 

04:11:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So when you drop that question through like a pebble, whether any images, are there any colors, are there any faces? 

04:11:40
RICHARD There are some colors, there were some blue and white and kind of umm…, kind of an expanse of a, of a blue sky with some beautiful puffy clouds. 

04:11:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So you open your eyes, coming back and umm… so on a scale of one to ten, you let a number come. How connected to that place, bigger than any emotion, do you feel now? 

04:12:15
RICHARD About seven. 

04:12:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Super. And how did you do that? 

04:12:25
RICHARD I did what you said. I dropped the question and let it. 

04:12:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:12:35
RICHARD And then things opened up. 

04:12:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do, do you think that's what Quincy and Zoey have been trying to teach you for the past six years? Richard. 

04:12:40
RICHARD They have been trying to teach me a lot but some what successful but I'm stuck. 

04:12:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Do you think that's what Mozart has been trying to teach you? 

04:12:50
RICHARD Well, sometimes I talk to Beethoven, he teaches a lot. 

04:12:55
[sil.] 

04:13:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, we've got this question about how to umm… keep the self-connection, not be reactive when somebody does something, unfair, unkind to you and that's why really sort of asking, how do you already find those states? 

04:13:25
RICHARD I'm sorry, I didn't follow this. 

04:13:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah so the, the basic question that you're bringing up if I'm hearing you correctly is how do you maintain a positive state, a non-reactive state? 

04:13:40
RICHARD How do I maintain it? By not in it for that moment. 

04:13:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How do you react to it. Great. 

04:13:50
RICHARD Yeah. And you know, it's, I immediately reconnect with over and it almost always verbal something belittling or something like that. 

04:14:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is that nice to witness uh… Richard talking right now? 

04:14:10
RICHARD I don't know. Yeah, I guess. Because I'm talking to somebody I respect… 

04:14:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know, one of the things that you may have noticed in Jeff's work that I was very impressed is this moving from being inside the experience, I'm talking to sort of being a step removed. 

04:14:30
RICHARD Right. 

04:14:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And having this affectionate curiosity. Oh now Richard is saying this. 

04:14:35
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:14:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Now Richard is telling this. Now Richard is trying so hard to do this and it feel, feels to me that wherever you go into that state, it's sort of like this eight year old boy who's trying so hard to make something right. That he couldn't, he didn't have the power. 

04:15:05
RICHARD That's right. 

04:15:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN To make things right. So he was total impotent. 

04:15:10
RICHARD Absolutely right. 

04:15:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, yeah trying to make it right. 

04:15:20
RICHARD And the other thing that comes up now is there was that impotence and yet I was and directed to make things right as though, I could as an eight year old child, make an adult right in their feelings. 

04:15:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So why I'm sort of tuning into Joey and Quincy and Amadeus, maybe to make yourself as a man bigger now. So you can let the boy off the hook and not have him have to figure. 

04:16:05
RICHARD It out. 

04:16:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It out. As I hate to see him just getting retraumatized over and over and over. Not knowing what the hell hit him. How old are you now? 

04:16:25
RICHARD What the hell is it to you. 

04:16:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How older… 

04:16:30
RICHARD I said what the hell is it to you. I'm about to be 75. 

04:16:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You could say old enough, you know. 

04:16:35
RICHARD I'm about to be 75. 

04:16:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN 75. 

04:16:35
RICHARD Yes. 

04:16:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wow, that's old. 

04:16:40
RICHARD You bet. 

04:16:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I just turned 60 last year. 

04:16:50
RICHARD Yeah, you're just a kid. 

04:16:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I'm just a kid. Wow, you look pretty young for 75. 

04:16:55
RICHARD Pretty young, ugly, you said for 75? 

04:16:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You look young. 

04:16:55
RICHARD Oh, really. 

04:16:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's just your spirit. 

04:17:00
RICHARD You're being a good Irishman, again. 

04:17:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN No, no, I'm really being honest. I mean, you have this sort of your spirit it's like, like fresh. 

04:17:10
RICHARD That's what I feel. I do feel that I relate to that. I've been told things like that before. 

04:17:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So what, what is the best thing about being 75 compared to being eight? 

04:17:25
RICHARD The amount of life experience and knowledge and experience in general. 

04:17:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And what does that allow you to do? 

04:17:30
RICHARD To pick yourself in a whole bunch of different places, to know different experiences. 

04:17:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Which is brief of that, my own senses like I think that's probably relevant. 

04:17:55
RICHARD Probably what? 

04:17:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think that's probably relevant. Are you able to hear okay? I think that's probably relevant to the work that you're doing. 

04:18:10
RICHARD Okay. 

04:18:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Say I have the ability to take myself away. 

04:18:15
[sil.] 

04:18:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN If that boy is enforced to try to explain themselves. 

04:18:25
RICHARD How did you know that, that was it? The explain. 

04:18:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm a trained professional. 

04:18:30
RICHARD I thought, but I thought you were a trained professional swordsman. That was exactly and that's what happens. And that's what kind of, that's what kind of happens now. I, I, I'm feeling like I'm forced to explain myself. Why? 

04:18:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So too bad, you, you didn't live in the land of Quincy and Joey. 

04:18:55
RICHARD Can I go back to being a dog, Quincy, is it a possibility after this? 

04:19:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Maybe you can stay in the present moment. What a concept? You, sorry. Sorry, that, that's a little distraction sometimes. 

04:19:20
RICHARD Is this okay? 

04:19:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, so there is this process that happens repeatedly where somebody does something whether blame you or misunderstand you or demand something unfairly. 

04:19:40
RICHARD Exactly. 

04:19:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. And something activates inside of you and locks, something activates inside and locks. 

04:19:55
RICHARD Locks. Yes. 

04:20:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then there we go again. What I'm asking you to be willing to do is to take over for him as that boy. 

04:20:20
[sil.] 

04:20:25
RICHARD You mean, the big boy take over the small boy? 

04:20:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Something like that. 

04:20:30
RICHARD Okay. 

04:20:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:20:30
RICHARD The adult takeover from that. 

04:20:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So the, this questions I'm asking are really questions that you can be training yourself with at home. How do I connect to a big space where things are okay? 

04:20:50
RICHARD How do I do, meditation takes me there very, very well. 

04:20:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And can you notice rather than having to immediately give me a verbal response. 

04:21:05
[sil.] 

04:21:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What happens if you ask yourself to question in that way? A baby is asking how can I be more present with myself when somebody is an asshole? 

04:21:45
[sil.] 

04:22:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I try it. 

04:22:00
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:22:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. You know, when the Irish make a laughing they're really serious. When the Irish really want to make a serious point they use humor. 

04:22:10
RICHARD Right. 

04:22:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So how can I protect myself and get that eight year old boy out of harm's way. 

04:22:30
[sil.] 

04:22:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's cool. What did you find there? 

04:22:50
RICHARD I found that I was the adult looking at the eight year old boy the way I look at my dogs. 

04:23:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Sweet. 

04:23:05
RICHARD Yeah, yeah. 

04:23:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So now you've got three mammal persons to care for. Isn't it nice to teach yourself like a dog? 

04:23:15
RICHARD Yeah. Absolutely. 

04:23:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You're such a good boy. You're such a good boy. You're such a good boy. 

04:23:30
[sil.] 

04:23:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, what was the problem again? 

04:23:40
RICHARD I don't know. 

04:23:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Oh, yeah. Something happens where the eight year old gets caught in the line of fire. 

04:23:55
RICHARD And feels impotent, helpless. 

04:23:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm, I'm really sorry that happened for you. I'm really sorry. Umm… if I'm feeling accurately, you can correct me when that happen a number of times. 

04:24:15
RICHARD But before I came up here, the words beaten, beiterated and belittled were so much a part of my life as a child and up into early adolescence. 

04:24:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:24:30
RICHARD Literally. 

04:24:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:24:35
RICHARD And always having to explain it, everything I did or didn't do. 

04:24:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Me too. 

04:24:45
RICHARD Really? We must have lived down the streets from each other. 

04:24:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I don't know but it was you know, my first connection to trance. You know, I just would zone out. Yeah. 

04:25:00
RICHARD I used to now, wow. The way, I used to do that especially was I would lay on my back and look at the clouds in the sky and what did I get is an image here. 

04:25:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:25:10
RICHARD The blue and the white. The cloud in the sky. 

04:25:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Blue light, yeah. Take off. Isn't that really a beautiful sort of poignant thing to realize about the best way that you dealt with that horrible inappropriate, violent attack on yourself? 

04:25:40
RICHARD Yes. See, I couldn't have doggies then. I can now and now I am getting something else. 

04:25:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:25:50
RICHARD I can, I can ask that eight year old to play with the doggies that I have. 

04:25:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Was, might have been good that you didn't have a dog because I have a dog then and we turned her into the most neurotic beast. You know, in my family you never, you could never talk directly. So like I would come home and my mom would look at the dog who we call Wiggle Bottom because she would just, mom would say, Wiggle Bottom did you tell me where Steve went today? Wiggle Bottom is like oh, shit, here we go again. 

04:26:25
RICHARD Here we go again. 

04:26:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And I'd say, no wiggy, wiggy, Wiggle Bottom you didn't tell mom that I went to play basketball. So I read Milton Erickson, they said, he's so indirect, he said, what's so indirect about that? That's my family communication? So I, I, I went away to and I really can empathize about this journey to come back and what it means to come back in a way that you can get protection and healing and take that wounded self out of harm's way and be able to use some of the things you've learnt in this long, long, long, long life that you have. 

04:27:30
RICHARD I used the wrong finger but this… 

04:27:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN These are Irish fingers. He's an Italian… Okay, what was the problem again? 

04:27:50
RICHARD I don't know. We were going to a movie weren't we? 

04:27:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. Well, we're going to some visualization about the same problem. Every time that you feel that resentment you're touching that eight year old kid, get the shit beat out of him. And somebody has to let him know, it's not about you. It's not about you. It was never about you. All the violence and the anger and the finger pointing, it's not about you. Somebody should tell him that, don't you think? 

04:28:50
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:28:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Any suggestions? Any old men that you know? 

04:29:00
RICHARD Well, you're one, of course. Yeah, I'm old enough to be able to tell that kid that. 

04:29:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What does it mean? How would he, how much do you feel for his presence right now? 

04:29:10
RICHARD A lot. 

04:29:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Scale one to ten. 

04:29:15
RICHARD At least an eight. 

04:29:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great. How much do you feel this old 75 year old guy So I'm sort of needling you, it's just trying to stay off, it's not me. 

04:29:25
RICHARD It probably in the seven range. 

04:29:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Probably. 

04:29:25
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:29:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Is that actually you're a seven or an eight? Because it, it's important to know. 

04:29:35
RICHARD That's a seven. About, why can't I, all right, it's a seven. 

04:29:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN What, what do you think you can do to boost your adult self and maybe a little bit stronger than that kid who got caught in the line of fire and again asking that question is a… 

04:30:15
[sil.] 

04:30:25
RICHARD Well… 

04:30:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I don't think you seem to hear me… 

04:30:30
RICHARD I thought, you were asking what can I… 

04:30:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I know, in, what, what I'm playing with you about is I'm encouraging you not to go back into that verbal thinking. 

04:30:40
RICHARD Okay. 

04:30:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Because I think it will bring you back into the, I'm already fucked. The damage is already done. 

04:30:55
[sil.] 

04:31:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm gonna ask the question. Some other part of me that's now here. To let that question not be in terms of this constipation, you know, let to, let it be part of a question that moves through the creativity that you had before the pain, creativity that you discovered afterwards. It's Mozart, seriously with, with your dogs just a few of I'm sure many, many connections that you've been able to find and claim. So, I'm just inviting you so that you don't retraumatize that wounded self. Don't have him answer the question. 

04:32:15
RICHARD Now the kid answer it. 

04:32:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:32:20
RICHARD Well, the sense, I got was to take him up in the glider with me and soar. 

04:32:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So should I ask to, I showed you tag team with Jeff now and… 

04:32:30
RICHARD Sure. 

04:32:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Because I'll throw up because of it. You, you think, you can do it solo? 

04:32:40
RICHARD Yes. 

04:32:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So let's just take a few moments and say every time I, I feel caught in that line of fire, I feel stuck and resentment. I feel regressed and just take that little boy, take him on his little trip, take him to some safe place, let him play, feel his own connection. 

04:33:30
[sil.] 

04:33:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So that when you come back, you realize that the question is to you now as a man what do you want to say when you get to subject it is to that unfairness? 

04:33:55
[sil.] 

04:34:00
RICHARD What do I want to say when I get subjected to that again? 

04:34:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, what do you want to say and I couldn't help but notice, now that's the Italian part of you. 

04:34:15
RICHARD There is no other part. 

04:34:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

04:34:15
RICHARD I said, there is no other part than Italian. Umm… with coming up from this, you know, you tell, some people uh… go fly a kite, take a hike, well, what I tell myself is go fly a kite. Get above it. 

04:34:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And then what would you say to those people who wanted to be an asshole towards you as a 75 year old man? Would you say, I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse? 

04:34:55
[sil.] 

04:35:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So here, here is where this difference that we've been working on and that trying to answer that question here versus letting the question go through you to seeing what your creative self brings to you now. 

04:35:25
RICHARD Interesting. This is, this moment when you said letting it go through me, it was different because it seemed to open things up as it went through me, maybe wash some things away. 

04:35:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. That's a good feeling, that's a good feeling to memorize, that, that thing through. I, I use that myself sincerely. 

04:35:40
RICHARD Great. 

04:35:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I just sort of imagine standing under a water fall. Where in I keyed all the Japanese have something called Misoki (ph) which means purification. And when I, and if you ever see those photos of them jumping in the icy rivers. 

04:36:05
RICHARD Yes. 

04:36:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You have to do that but that's, that's the, letting something move through you. And we're, we're still sort of on the threshold of this question as a man what I would say to any of those assholes who try to mistreat this young kid, I'm, I'm really asking you sincerely. 

04:36:40
RICHARD What, what I would say to them? 

04:36:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:36:40
RICHARD Fuck off. 

04:36:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And whether there be a somatic model of that? And again, notice, here you go into this thinking rather than… 

04:37:05
RICHARD Sorry, I don't come up with a somatic model and prepare. 

04:37:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Your body to start it to move. So… So you hear yourself thinking and see yourself thinking away from your body. Think through your body. 

04:37:20
RICHARD I'm getting uh… kind of an oppositional experience. It's both letting go and getting a grip. 

04:37:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Right. Get rid of, notice your fear of killing somebody? 

04:37:35
RICHARD Do I have noticed it who yeah? 

04:37:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't that great to know? 

04:37:40
RICHARD Sometimes. 

04:37:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know, I, I Milton Erickson did a piece of therapy with me on that? 

04:37:45
RICHARD No. 

04:37:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I was so afraid of my anger and I started doing psychotherapy about 19. I thought, I just have to be calm and pleasant and authentic and then this cynical bastard would slip out and criticize people and I think, I'm so sorry I have to go more therapy. He was the teenager grow up and his father threw him up against the wall and said look at me when I'm hitting you. 

04:38:25
[sil.] 

04:38:30
RICHARD I want to punch him. 

04:38:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Sorry. 

04:38:30
RICHARD I want to punch your father. 

04:38:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great so that part that's your resource. So I asked Erickson please help me get over these angry feelings. You know, what he did. He, he invited me to find a place in my body, where I could comfortably feel that angry kid. Now he's a major member of my inner team. He's my bullshit detector. When I'm trying to be polite, nice, you know, how your dog is growling. The kids are cowering is that, I'm trying to be polite and nice and authentic is that, that part flies out and it says you're a fucking lying bastard. I say, that's great, thank you for bringing that. 

04:39:35
RICHARD Interestingly enough, if it happens that someone outside of my intimate circle says something or does something assholian or nasty, there is no doubt that I'd be writing that person's face. 

04:39:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN But we're talking about people you're closest with. 

04:39:55
RICHARD Yeah, I can't. 

04:39:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN People that are like them. 

04:40:00
RICHARD Yeah, I can't do that to them. 

04:40:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN And that part of you that just, I can see in your eyes, and just allowing inviting to comfortably, let him be present. He's ready and incredibly courageous, important part of yourself I see him, I respect him. Isn't it nice to see, you know, sometimes I notice that part of me sort of slicing somebody's head off. That's interesting. 

04:40:55
[sil.] 

04:41:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Isn't it crazy that you can imagine anything you want? 

04:41:00
RICHARD Right. 

04:41:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN How did you found as a therapist that 90% of what each person thinks is illegal? 

04:41:05
RICHARD Yes. 

04:41:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Who, who was it George Bush who said, if my thought dreams could be seen, they probably put my head in a guillotine. 

04:41:20
RICHARD George was so full of wisdom. 

04:41:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Robert Zimmerman, the famous psychologist from Minnesota. 

04:41:25
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:41:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you know him? 

04:41:25
RICHARD I know the name. 

04:41:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN He also sang as Bob Dylan. 

04:41:30
RICHARD Oh, that's why I know the name. 

04:41:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN If my thought, dreams could be seen, that would put my head in a guillotine. 

04:41:40
RICHARD That makes sense. 

04:41:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I just love hearing that song. It's great to hear it to feel your crazy inner self. 

04:41:50
RICHARD Yeah. 

04:41:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. So when somebody says, you feel that part just. 

04:42:00
RICHARD Off with your head. 

04:42:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Great and then feel the delight. Feel the delight. Feel the dark side Richard. Come to the dark side. 

04:42:20
[sil.] 

04:42:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Feel the playful delight of knowing that you have an ex-murderer inside you. 

04:42:35
[sil.] 

04:42:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Remember when the Irish are trying to make a serious point, they use laughter and humor. 

04:42:50
RICHARD I get it. 

04:42:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So for the rest of your life, I mean, more you live. 

04:42:55
RICHARD That's a good question. 

04:43:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN When you get to be old age no longer just a theoretical question. 

04:43:05
RICHARD Oh, not at all. 

04:43:05
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:43:05
RICHARD I just lost my sister two weeks ago. 

04:43:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'm sorry. Sorry. 

04:43:15
RICHARD But she left me a lot including that we had been a team as children to survive these. And she told a story of how umm… she taught me to dance and that's by piece of where I still love the music when I was about eight is when she taught me to dance and she's writing on the kitchen and she had a slip she was writing and she's, oh, sense of that. We're dancing and soon the smoke started to rising from the slip and my sister just broke down and wept because she said soon mom comes. She's gonna. So soon my mother walked through the door. I walked up to my mother and I said mommy I'm so sorry, I was, and I got shit, get that to me. And my sister said, "You know, we were really great part and you were always my little big brother." And she said, "We haven't turned out so bad for what we had to go through." Actually she said, we turned out pretty good is the way she said it. 

04:44:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN That's like a beautiful sister. So for her, for all of the people that had been abused for yourself to say, when I feel that younger vulnerable self being exposed again, I send him away and then I let this other presence come forward in a comfortable, playful, that's a beautiful thing that Erickson taught me in that trance. You don't have to squeeze your muscles to let your ex-murderer express itself with carefree abandonment. 

04:45:30
RICHARD I'm getting a very good image, thank you. 

04:45:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So, we, we got to start to close about, shall we do one for uh… the Christmas holidays? Do you celebrate the holidays? For the new year, for your 76th year, for your 77th year, to your 80th birthday that when somebody does this, send the boy away and just notice what comes out to say you're talking to me. So, shall we do this? 

04:46:15
RICHARD Yes. 

04:46:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Relax, playful, gleefully, that's right. That's right. Just not as all the beautiful images, your unconscious brings, cracking somebody's head open. 

04:46:40
RICHARD Using a blunt force instrument. 

04:46:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN There you go. All right, George, I think, you just got it. 

04:46:50
RICHARD I can get into this. 

04:46:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think he's got it. I, I know, you have such heart and goodness that you would not Paul:ass on that violence. So this way, I'm encouraging you not to be afraid of that anger inside yourself. It's really healthy and you can enjoy all the ways that it just shows you through your imagination that, that imagination is much more vivid… 

04:47:40
RICHARD Than that. Yeah. It's also much more open than that. 

04:47:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Take care brother. 

04:47:45
RICHARD Thank you brother. Thank you. 

04:47:50
[sil.] 

04:48:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Wouldn't it be nice if they were there then? 

04:48:15
RICHARD Oh, boy, I could use it. Well, I got you now in my head. 

04:48:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Could you all come home with Richard? 

04:48:25
RICHARD I'm taking them. 

04:48:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I'll take them all home with me. I'm serious. 

04:48:30
RICHARD I know. 

04:48:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I've learned, you know, when I was younger, I was much more in the straight and narrow path. Every time I make a conscious uh… sense everybody in here, that's okay, I'm taking you into my heart and bringing you on my journey. Taking you into my heart and bringing you on my journey. Take good care. 

04:48:55
RICHARD Thanks. 

04:49:00
[sil.] 

04:49:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know the old, the old, the most important of the Irish toasts? Richard. 

04:49:20
RICHARD I'm sorry, excuse me. 

04:49:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's all right. The most important of the Irish toasts? I'm half Italian, half Irish. 

04:49:30
RICHARD Are you kidding me? 

04:49:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, (inaudible ), from Torino, the ports of Torino. Don't let the bastards get you down. Don't let the bastards get you down. Okay, okay. 

04:49:50
[sil.] 

04:50:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Do you have a mic? 

04:50:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Mic, Michelle, sound. Sound, yeah, good So uh… I would say… 

04:50:15
[sil.] 

04:50:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Summarize the session. 

04:50:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I thought, it was really beautiful and like the start, I think it's something that we all can learn from what you're asking of yourself what you're asking of your community, what you're asking of me and then also for you to go, just you to say what you are asking of you and at that moment, so I think that… 

04:50:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I've really found that really helpful. I just sort of stumbled upon it and found it had such a value both for me as a therapist and for the client. 

04:50:55
JEFFREY ZEIG I think it's really nice that extra step, especially of what, what are you asking of you. 

04:51:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:51:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And I think that's really beautiful. t's, it's really an interesting uh… conundrum for me and for many therapists like how do you know when you've landed, like you had, you did so many different things, you know, the, the robot sounds and the dogs and how do you see the uh… eight year old boy and how can you receive him and how can you do radical acceptance of your, of your own sentiments? There are so many different things, any one of which could be umm… sufficient in its own right and we don't know and partly in the demonstration it seems to pay to do this and that, and this and that and this and that and then see what sticks and, and how that works. 

04:51:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

04:51:55
JEFFREY ZEIG So uh… I wouldn't know what was most meaningful out of all of the things that you did but certainly there are a lot of different angles that you came from. Now an interesting additional angle is okay, well, if you think about one of the things that handling of viewing, you change the doing. Right so a lot of the emphasis is on changing the viewing how can you see this situation differently and then you take the step of thinking how will you change the doing? So at those moments, when somebody is for example belittling or uh… beating up on Richard what does he say in response and umm… so a question that I would have is you know, why take that extra step, why not just stop with orienting him to reperceive things and why go to that extra step of how will he behaviorially handle those moments? 

04:53:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Because that's really a test, I mean, you have this inner connection with yourself but the question is how do you sustain that out in the world? So ultimately now we can do all these inner trance stuff and get these good connections but you another usually within five seconds of actually stepping back into what performance out in the world, something challenges it. So it's more important to me the other as preparatory work, you know, the, the shifting of, of relationship with himself. But ultimately, it's how are you going to stay whole as you walk through other stuff in your life. That, that to me is the question. And you know, we, we talked, I said, I don't know, if it's different what you're calling strategic umm… and what, what you're using were archetypal. It actually maybe in the sense that I have come to think that the way that I work has to do with what Bateson (ph.) called aesthetic intelligence. Maybe it's closer to the notion of the narrative or the story that you were talking about as a scriptwriter where, where think uh… Bateson, he was the, my teacher before Erickson, you know, used to talk uh… about uh… there were different types of logic. There was deductive, inductive and then there was this aesthetic logic. And aesthetic is how all the different parts fit together into a whole. And in order to have creativity, in order to have good health, in order to enjoy life, all the parts have to be fitting together. When they do, it's, it's shown by, you feel, I'm alive. You feel that there is a buzz, you can feel that there is a musicality, you can feel there is a flow. So to me that's, that's the main thing that I'm looking to, to help a person create. So I'm not thinking in terms of this technique or that technique but let's get, let's get the music going and, and usually the main thing I'm looking is where, where there is an imbalance because everything that's there contain its opposite and it's the dynamic balance between the opposites that you have to be holding, the sweet, finding the sweet spot and when that happens, boom, is that I'm here. So to me that's what guiding it. I'm not thinking so much linearly as sort of spacially in terms of what's the balance where the music can begin to spontaneously arrive. 

04:55:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Yep. Yeah, I think, it was, you know, inspired and great choice as in lots of different angles and uh… perspectives that you gave him and uh… and it worked you know perfectly to think through uh… some scenarios of how you're going to respond more adequately. Umm… you know, when people do things that are for example belittling, belittling, so I think I would have stopped at the perceptual part and I think that your choice of going on to, to the responsive part was inspired and worked very well. 

04:56:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think that is something that has really changed in the last ten years that I tended to think if we just do good work in trance, it will generalize into their life and I was forced to uh… admit it wasn't a lot of the time that it, the inner change was, was not translating that it had to be directly connected to what are you facing in your life, what is triggering these old states? How, how do you focus on them, look forward to them, predict them, anticipate them and then practice all of these activation of the new resources in relationship to that. 

04:57:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, so then it's as if at the end, you're setting up moment where you can provide a direct or a symbolic challenge to Richard that gives him the opportunity to live the change. 

04:57:20
STEPHEN GILLIGAN I think so. 

04:57:25
JEFFREY ZEIG In the room at the end of the session. 

04:57:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, I think that's beginning to move from the work in the session to, okay this is what you learnt, let's start looking in terms of what you're gonna go back to. You know, and I think that and, and you were doing that actually uh… with Christopher. 

04:57:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes, yes. 

04:57:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You know, we're doing it inside of the trance and then have them come out of the trance and look at what we, what we created here today is only relevant to the extent that you have it available in response to the environmental conditions that you're going back to. 

04:58:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Now would you do it in a more umm… formal way where you would ask Richard to envision himself in some future scene where somebody… 

04:58:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Uh… a lot of times and we just didn't have time. So, all things being equal, I would prefer to do that. Sometimes I just, we just ran out of time. 

04:58:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Sure, sure. Very well done Really beautiful for both of you and I'm sure absolutely meaningful and uh… and transformative for you. You got it. Yes. If only I was Irish and Italian. So let's see what else we have. 

04:58:45
[sil.] 

04:58:50
UNKNOWN I mean, that was really moving. 

04:58:50
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You mind standing? 

04:58:55
UNKNOWN Stand, okay. Now, that was very moving and there was a moment umm… the moment you said umm…, you saw an eight year old child, I mean it shocked me, shocked Richard, I'm sure, shocked other people at the presence, presence of that, is there anyway to put that into words of how you came to that? Somehow when you said it, I saw it, and I saw it on his face. Yeah, there is a, there is a child but is there some way to articulate how that came to you? 

04:59:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Well, to me, it's, it's cultivating each therapist to me has to find a way to cultivate a sort of a working trance state. I don't know if that's the best way to describe it. But you are the, to do the work with people, you want to be in two worlds simultaneously. You want, you want to be in this world, in the here and now and you want to be in the imagination world. Because that's, that's, that's those are the two worlds that they are using to create. So I'm trying to feel this but always open here and open here. Everything they're saying, I'm trying to, in the same way that I was inviting Richard. I'm trying to let it flow through me? I just see, it's, it's sort of as, as the it goes through those images that pop up. Those are suggestions from the unconscious about what might be relevant to the work. Do I believe them as true? Never But there are interesting suggestions that can be checked out and a lot of times it, it zings in and you've opened up another dimension of the work. 

05:00:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Another, another way of looking at that is that you could think about hypnotic phenomena and disassociation as a hypnotic phenomena, catalypsy (ph.) is a hypnotic phenomena and amnesia is a hypnotic phenomena, anaesthesia is a hypnotic phenomena, age regression (ph.) is a hypnotic phenomena. So when the person is talking about the problem, one template that I could use as an assessment advice is thinking, okay, what is his problem like as a hypnotic phenomena, oh, it's like an age regression (ph.) oh what age might that be? And then that would allow me to enter into things in a way that would be similar to the way that Stephen entered into it. Oh, Richard is having a little age regression and that's very understandable in consideration of his developmental history and we all, if we didn't have age regressions, you and I would have to do honest work and I'm not cut out for that. I don't know about you. So umm… so that might help me to get to the same place and Stephen's way of thinking about it would be a little different. My way of thinking about it. 

05:01:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN As, as were yours. What we're trying to learn from trance is the difference between thinking with neuromuscular lock, I call constipated thinking. That's the conscious mind. That's where unfortunately what we're trained to think as therapist, that's our professional training. If you notice, you know, where I interrupted at least a dozen times in him directly was when he went to respond to a question by going into that moment. I am, I am experientially convinced that only thing you can get in those states is the past. So we as therapists, we have to learn how to think like this. So all the psycho aerobics that Jeff does in that, that beautiful book that he wrote on psycho aerobics, these are some of the training exercises that Erickson, you know was, he was the master and I think he inspired all of the students, that's what we have to train ourselves. That's, that's the major part of the training that we're trying to do as Ericksonnian training. 

05:02:50
UNKNOWN And just a thought so, if that didn't land, if you didn't notice physiologic change or something… 

05:02:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Most of what I do doesn't land. Most of the techniques, you use fail. If you're, I, I was asking, I asked a professional soccer football coach uh… the number of shots on goal, what percentage in an all star player like Messi or something what, how many go in and he, he was a coach. He said, 20% is really high. So if one out of five of your techniques works you're an all star. 

05:03:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

05:03:25
STEPHEN GILLIGAN You're just looking for resonance. You're just looking for resonance. Is it eight? Nothing there Okay, that's interesting. I'm not, I'm not trying to interpret and say he's eight and you have to admit it. I have no darn idea. 

05:03:45
JEFFREY ZEIG I would reiterate that point. I think it's really uh… valuable to just underline that. If you think about a professional baseball player and if you get, if you get a hit every uh… 2.5 times out of ten, they'll pay you ten million dollars a year to play professional baseball and in our situation because it's so non-linear, to think that the things that I might orient towards or say or, or use would be immediately effect of some one to one ratio is completely unrealistic. I think that uh… you know, there are very few people who can back 400. 

05:04:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN If you keep the connection, it doesn't matter. You know, Richard, Richard, wanted to say something. 

05:04:40
RICHARD Steve, when you very, very correctly kept insisting that I come out from the head and as you got me to relate more to going through, I did get away from the past, I did get away from the past and it also was not trying to figure it out in the future. 

05:05:00
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

05:05:00
RICHARD Because when I was relating cognitively to the past and then what should I think about, it was, very, very different. 

05:05:10
STEPHEN GILLIGAN So Erickson was about ten times more severe on that point with the most of us. 

05:05:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And then the other thing I want to comment on and this is something I experienced as, as a therapist using hypnosis is that when you are really working well with each other, the unconscious of you is talking to the unconscious of me and vice versa. 

05:05:30
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah. 

05:05:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Super. So we have one, two. 

05:05:35
[sil.] 

05:05:45
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Go ahead. 

05:05:45
JEFFREY ZEIG It doesn't matter. 

05:05:45
UNKNOWN One thing I noticed George again, you know, he asked that, he said, "As when the session begin Richard, your breathing and your speech was halted, broken, blocked and as you just spoke now, as sweet, smooth, even and powerful flow. And as you went through the session that begin to come forward and I could only assume that, that was probably a great indicator for you that." 

05:06:15
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Yeah, totally So we not only uh… you're bringing in relax but x-lax too. 

05:06:25
JEFFREY ZEIG I think it was a matter of being thoughtful and wanting to be precise and it seem taking time to formulate concepts that would really reach Richard and then as you get, as you hone in, you can become a little more fluid in the process. 

05:06:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN It's, it's hard work being spontaneous. I, I, I don't, I don't mean that in any arrogant way. But I, I think what Jeff is pointing to you have to practice a lot to be able to have that sort of spontaneity. There, there is no substitute for totally committed practice and with the proper attitude, you know, to me the attitude, I totally want to get who this person is. The fullness of their being and I want to invite them to live it fully in the world. Please. 

05:07:20
UNKNOWN Well, some of my question was about the intuition that you used. We talked a lot about intuition and using your body to sense what is going on and I'm wondering if there is a practice meditation of some sort or that you use. 

05:07:35
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Psycho aerobic book. That's a good place to start. 

05:07:40
JEFFREY ZEIG What? 

05:07:40
STEPHEN GILLIGAN The psycho aerobic book. 

05:07:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Maybe. It's a lot of work on intuition and there is books on intuition in psychotherapy not enough work but if you look, I just recently looked about intuition in psychotherapy. There is a book and one of my uh… colleague students is also on the trail of writing another book about intuition and if you think about as intuition, it somehow seems to be a limiting frame and if you orient yourself to the number of creative baby thoughts that you have during the course of being with another human being, then you're just allowing those creative baby thoughts to bubble to the surface and save them with the knowledge that you will utilize whatever responses that you get and uh… then you're building intuition. Eric Burn, the founder of Trance actual analysis. One of his first books was on, it was one of his last books was on intuition. There is a book by Eric Burn and a more recent book on intuition that may give some, shed some light about how psychotherapists can use intuition proper. I think about as baby thoughts. 

05:08:55
STEPHEN GILLIGAN Okay, are we. We're moving towards. 

05:09:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Like ideal like perfect, like it's the right time.
