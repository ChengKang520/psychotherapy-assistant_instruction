Advanced Techniques of Experiential Therapy 

00:00:20
Jeffrey Zeig, PhD 

00:00:30
JEFFREY ZEIG So what we have here is clinical demonstration. And Marion is kindly volunteered to the demonstration subject and what we hope to demonstrate is experiential brief therapy. I don't consider myself to be an Ericksonian therapist. I consider myself to be an experiential therapist. I think the essence of Milton Erickson was being experiential, rather than being didactic, that rather than trying to reach people in to what they can understand cognitively, what people realize is what helps them to be in the most adapted state to accomplish their goal. So this is brief, which means it's solution focused, oriented, towards a constructive future rather than analyzing the roots from the past and directed towards things that people can change. So, Marion, so nice of you to volunteer and in this very quiet intimate setting. And so please what is it that you'll have yourself accomplish? 

00:01:35
MARION What have I, what have I accomplished? 

00:01:35
JEFFREY ZEIG What will you have yourself accomplish? Let's say that this time that we spend together is remarkably successful? How will we know? 

00:01:45
MARION Umm… I think I'll feel a greater level of confidence. 

00:01:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:01:50
MARION And using some of the things I've learned this weekend, and what I've been exposed to over the years doing hypnosis… 

00:01:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, help me to understand a greater level of confidence and because we are doing Experiential Therapy, I'd like to understand it experiential. So I'm going to stand up, right? 

00:02:10
MARION Umm… 

00:02:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And right now I'm in neutral, so I don't represent anything. Now if you said, uh… represent being thoughtful, I could represent being thoughtful and we might all agree that, that statue represented being thoughtful. If you said to represent being motivated, I could even be in a kinetic posture that represented being motivated. Okay, I'd like to represent for a moment and feel for a moment greater confidence. So you're the sculpture, I'll do all the work, I'm the statue. You just tell me what to do, and help me to get a felt sense of greater confidence, your goal. 

00:02:55
MARION Umm… So interesting, okay. Umm… I guess feeling more forward in my body. 

00:03:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Moving forward in my body? 

00:03:00
MARION Yeah, a little bit. 

00:03:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so is this moving forward? 

00:03:05
MARION Yeah, that's good enough. 

00:03:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:03:05
MARION Umm… 

00:03:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Don't get you close. 

00:03:10
[sil.] 

00:03:15
MARION Umm… I, I don't have to represent that my mind is on… uh… that my mind is here all the time. 

00:03:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-uhh… your mind is here all the time. So greater confidence is being present? 

00:03:25
MARION Yes, much more present. 

00:03:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so when you are talking about being much more present, you're nodding your head, you're widening your eyes. So let me represent that as I see it in you, and I'm just, you know, tilted my head slightly, I'm nodding my head. I'm widening my eyes. I can feel it, kind of even interesting moisture under, under my eyes. And I am moving forward and I'm being present, and does this represent to you greater confidence? 

00:04:00
MARION Umm…and a sense of openness. 

00:04:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Openness, so if I open my hands, so I open, I'm present, I'm moving forward. And if I submit those things, open, present, moving forward, forward, open, present, present, open, forward, okay, feel that, present, open, forward. How am I doing at being the statue that represents what it is that you…? 

00:04:30
MARION I think you look great. I think that would look a little weird with my clients, but yes… 

00:04:35
JEFFREY ZEIG It would be weird to your clients? 

00:04:35
MARION I think so. 

00:04:35
JEFFREY ZEIG But this is an internal representation. It's an artistic representation. 

00:04:40
MARION And there's also a part where I think I'd feel very connected to an inner wisdom. 

00:04:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. 

00:04:45
MARION And I don't know how you'd represent that, but there's a, an inner reflection at the same time. 

00:04:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So… Okay, so it's like, I want to be in the title of this sculpture. And the title of the sculpture is greater confidence. And some of the components to this sculpture are to be open, to be present, to be moving forward, and to feel like I can lean back into an accrued wisdom that I have available to me, a repository of wisdom that I have available to me. 

00:05:25
MARION Excuse me. Just having a few feelings. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, so help me for a minute to understand. If those, those tears had words? What would those tears say? 

00:05:35
MARION You can't do this. 

00:05:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-umm… So the tears uh… are saying you can't do this. And what's the emotion that goes along with those tears? 

00:05:50
MARION Ah… fear. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Fear? 

00:05:50
MARION And rejection. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Rejection? 

00:05:55
MARION Yeah. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-umm… Okay, so now, you know, homeopathy being what it is, homeopathy is a little bit of the hair of the dog that bit you. 

00:06:05
MARION Yes, it is. 

00:06:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Right, so umm… if you give somebody too much of a dose, that's not going to be therapeutic but a little bit of the hair of the dog that bit you wouldn't be so bad. 

00:06:20
MARION No, probably pretty good. 

00:06:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So let's ask Wakhi,(ph) who's one of my students and Wakhi(ph)is going to represent umm… rejection. Right! So he's going to give you a little dose of rejection right now. And we're going to just see how you tolerate this. 

00:06:40
MARION Okay. 

00:06:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-umm… in there homeopathic sense of building up your immunity by giving you a little bit of the virus. 

00:06:50
MARION Okay. 

00:06:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay? So umm… you could hold on for a moment to what I've been doing so far, right? Which is the ease… So now what I'd like you to do is to just get an image, but not an image of me, an image of you. And that this internal image of you is that you're moving forward and that's certainly something that you are very easily capable of doing, because there's many initiatives that you've taken over the course of your life. And there's a repository of wisdom of all of the initiatives that you have taken in life. And certainly there's been lots of examples of you being open to being, to enjoying new experiences and being here is one of those. 

00:07:55
MARION That's true. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? 

00:07:55
MARION Yeah. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And uh… this sense of ease of a flow of momentum. And so for a moment, I'd like you to hear those words and it may help you to take a deep breath, and to close your eyes, and to hear in your language, in your experience, open, and to understand and to hear in your experience, in your language moving forward. And to realize in your way present, and wisdom, and gently, and easily, and surely and securely, and securely and surely begin to allow yourself to riff on those as if you were a musician and you were just riffing on some themes. And that you're riffing on the themes, those four themes. And that as you riff on those words, and so if you hear the porosity, the musical nature of those words present, and open, and forward and wisdom. That you can begin to develop in your mind's eye an image, your own sculpture that represents the essence of the synergy, of joining together those four ideas. And when you begin to get an image, and when you know that you can begin to get that image, then take another deep breath, and then open your eyes and bring yourself back here. Fantastic! And now Wakhi(ph) is going to offer you a little bit of rejection, not too much. So watch him, if he's going to be rejecting of you. 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:25
JEFFREY ZEIG How do you tolerate that? 

00:10:30
MARION I'm doing all right. I'm just kind of… 

00:10:30
JEFFREY ZEIG (inaudible ). 

00:10:32
MARION Yeah, it's pretty powerful. 

00:10:35
JEFFREY ZEIG What's powerful? 

00:10:35
MARION The image. 

00:10:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic! Your image. I'm not able to ask you what that image is. But if you want to volunteer, it's perfectly fine. 

00:10:45
MARION It's umm… it's a white horse with wings… 

00:10:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Like Pegasus? 

00:10:50
MARION Like a goddess kind of thing. 

00:10:55
JEFFREY ZEIG A white horse with wings, uh-huh… 

00:10:55
MARION Yeah. 

00:11:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… nd those perhaps are different tears? 

00:11:00
MARION It's just hard to contain. 

00:11:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… hard to contain? 

00:11:05
MARION How powerful that is. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY ZEIG The image, how powerful that image is, really moving, transforming. 

00:11:10
MARION It's like woo… a lot of waves. 

00:11:15
JEFFREY ZEIG uh-huh… a lot of waves, strong waves. 

00:11:15
MARION Strong way, very strong. 

00:11:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic! Okay, let's do it again. And this time I'm going to ask Wakhi(ph) to do something that's not rejecting, but something that's frightening. Okay? So when you're ready, he's gonna do something that's mildly frightening. And then, you orient yourself to your power words, orient yourself to the synergy of those power words, or into yourself to your power image. And now do something that's frightening. 

00:11:55
WAKHI (ph) Uh… 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, well. 

00:12:10
[sil.] 

00:12:15
MARION Wow! 

00:12:15
JEFFREY ZEIG How was that? 

00:12:15
MARION Helpful. 

00:12:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Very helpful. Okay. So now should we just jump to, to the head of the class and really increase the amplitude in some extraordinary degree, would that be okay? 

00:12:30
MARION I'm not sure. It's still pretty wild in there. 

00:12:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. So let's just orient to a little bit more of the virus, so that you can anchor into yourself, those synergistic power words and synergistic power images. Okay? How are you doing that right now? 

00:12:50
MARION Uh… it's radiating. 

00:12:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Radiating? 

00:12:55
MARION Radial, radiating out through my body. It's not just here, it's uh… going out through my fingers, uh… down through my hoes. 

00:13:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… down to your heels, and your feet, uh-huh… a radiating sense of the essence of those power words, the synergy of them, and your white horse, flying horse image. Okay, so take a moment, anchor them inside yourself, orient yourself to the radiation of those. And then we're gonna ask Wakhi(ph) once again to increase the amplitude of rejection and fear, he'll do that, it will be frightening and be rejecting, it's a little bit more amplitude, right? Okay? Try it again. 

00:13:40
WAKHI (ph) No. You're not going to get it. No, I said, "No." 

00:13:50
MARION Yes, actually he looks scarily. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… Good. 

00:13:50
MARION Yeah. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So how are you doing in regard to maintaining your equanimity? 

00:13:55
MARION Not that freak. 

00:13:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Equanimity is an Asian, an Asian concept that we don't have a counterpart for in English. So in Japan, you would say that you are entitled to your wah(ph). And wah(ph) would be a sense of equanimity, but it's not really translatable. 

00:14:15
MARION Brings up sadness when you say that. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… wow. 

00:14:15
MARION Yeah! 

00:14:15
JEFFREY ZEIG It brings up sadness? 

00:14:20
MARION That you are entitled to your wah.(ph) 

00:14:20
JEFFREY ZEIG You're entitled uh-huh… to maintain your equanimity. Okay. Now I'm going to do this. And we can come back to that sadness if there's something in there that begins to resonate with you. I don't want to ignore that. So as you let yourself riff on sad, where does that take you? 

00:14:50
MARION Like my heart into my gut. 

00:14:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-huh… and sad has what characteristics? Let's… If you showed me sad, and I had sad and I was holding sad in your hands. So take the sad. Loan it to me for a minute. Wait, I've got your sad and I'm holding it and it's been the part of you. And suddenly your sad, when we were doing one thing about helping you to stay in your wah(ph), helping you to stay in your power. Suddenly you're sad came up and I've got it right now. What, what is your sad look like? 

00:15:45
MARION Uh… it's like a… It looks like a little girl. 

00:15:50
JEFFREY ZEIG A little girl? Uh-uh… is she sitting, is she standing? 

00:15:55
[sil.] 

00:16:00
MARION She's standing. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Oh, my. You know my proventil side got the impulse, like, suddenly I just wanted to kiss her wound. We'll do something that helped her so that she didn't feel so standing alone with her sadness. 

00:16:20
MARION Would have been helpful? 

00:16:25
[sil.] 

00:16:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Uh-huh… And what would you say to her sad standing there a little girl? What would you want her to know? 

00:16:35
MARION How precious she was. 

00:16:40
JEFFREY ZEIG So suddenly you beam to her, radiate to her, precious. And as you beam to her, as you radiate to her, the realization precious. Did you do that by breathing life into her? Did you do that by smiling at her? Did you do that by looking at her? And not a word that you say but in orientation precious… Because as a little girl, she may not understand that the meaning of precious, and she can certainly understand the realization precious… and somehow that may help her in, inexplicable way to maintain her wah(ph) to be able to use her power orientations. 

00:17:35
MARION Yeah, I think so. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-umm… And in a wordless way, it could even be that somehow you were orienting her to moving forward. 

00:17:50
MARION Yeah. 

00:17:55
JEFFREY ZEIG And that you're orienting her at to be present. 

00:17:55
MARION Yeah. 

00:18:00
JEFFREY ZEIG And to rely on her crude wisdom and to be open to many new experiences. 

00:18:10
MARION Yeah. 

00:18:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-umm… 

00:18:10
MARION Yeah. 

00:18:15
JEFFREY ZEIG And she somehow seemed to change in her orientation to me. 

00:18:25
MARION Yeah. Yeah! 

00:18:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Can I give her back to you now? 

00:18:25
MARION Yeah! 

00:18:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay. What's it like to take her back? 

00:18:35
MARION Uh… good. 

00:18:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Very good? 

00:18:35
MARION Yeah. 

00:18:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And then when you feel the warmth of your hands and the gentle pressure of your hands, and you… sense her inside you, that you can orient her in some implicit way to her power. 

00:18:55
MARION It's okay for her to have these feelings. 

00:19:00
JEFFREY ZEIG It would feel to feel good, bad, indifferent, right, wrong. You're entitled to your feelings. And you want her to realize that and somehow what happens to the hoarse when you do that, and what happens the power words when you do that? 

00:19:25
MARION Umm… she can be uh… pulled up on the back, I've got it worse. 

00:19:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Tremendous, she can be on the back of the horse. 

00:19:30
MARION She's not in front of the horse, she's on the back. 

00:19:35
JEFFREY ZEIG On the back of the horse. 

00:19:35
MARION Behind that, that other figure. 

00:19:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great, they are companying? 

00:19:40
MARION Umm… Yeah, she's holding on. 

00:19:45
JEFFREY ZEIG And get sense of her wisdom, and you get of sense of her presence and a sense of her desire to achieve and to learn, and to make all of the mistakes that are necessary to ensure adequate learning. In the sense that she's maturing and developing and moving herself into a more adaptive place. 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:15
MARION She really needs to know that there's that strong figure uh… in front. 

00:20:20
JEFFREY ZEIG The strong figure in front is what makes her, helps her to feel secure, which makes perfect sense. 

00:20:25
MARION Yeah! 

00:20:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? 

00:20:25
MARION Uh-umm… 

00:20:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Great! Okay, so now take one, or two, or three deep breaths, come back here, what's just like? 

00:20:35
MARION It's calmer. They are calmer. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY ZEIG You feel calm? 

00:20:40
MARION Yeah, I still have feelings but I feel calmer. 

00:20:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Right! More insight yourself, more able to see the color of my eyes, or movement of my hands, or the posture that I take, and more… 

00:20:55
MARION Like, I feel a little more adult, a little more. 

00:20:55
JEFFREY ZEIG More adult, okay. So I would like to umm… increase the amplitude in two steps, because I'd like you to take the amplitude of fear and rejection and still be into that place of greater confidence. Right? Regardless of what's happening is, is… Are you willing to experiment with that? 

00:21:20
MARION Um-umm… 

00:21:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, right. So we have an entire audience of people who are very glad to be fearful and rejected. Right? And whether than just use Wakhi(ph) and let's use the entire audience but that's only step one. Because there's going to be step two and that will help us to get you to where it is that you want to go. And sometimes by going into the black hole, you develop yourself into the universe where you want to be, rather than trying to resist the black hole which takes a lot of energy. Go into the problem. Is that okay? Okay, so let's have… Whoever wants to stand up and be rejecting and be fear-mongering, right? Right, whoever wants to please help us and, so medium level, not… This is not an opportunity for primal experience. So they are going to do this, right? So now you center yourself, get that little girl in the back of the horse, orient yourself to the synergy of your power words, and your power image, and then just watch and see, and they're doing this, okay? One, two, three. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Thank you so much. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:00
JEFFREY ZEIG How's that? 

00:23:00
MARION Interesting. 

00:23:00
JEFFREY ZEIG What's interesting? Help me to understand interesting? 

00:23:05
MARION Umm… there was a moment of like how real is this. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. 

00:23:05
MARION I was definitely like a little freak out, and, umm… and then it's uh… nothing in terms of what I, of what I hold inside. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY ZEIG I didn't understand, nothing what I hope. 

00:23:20
MARION It's nothing compared to what I hold inside. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. So now we're going to step two. 

00:23:25
MARION But by the way I have so much vibration going on. 

00:23:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Let's go to step two, uh-huh…. because step two is the more important one. And just to understand and to set a context for this, right? Watch me! Now I'm doing my best rendition of St. Vitus dance. And St. Vitus dance is a tic disorder, gross motor tics. And they're just neurological discharges. Okay, so now let's do the harder part. Ready? 

00:24:10
MARION Yeah. 

00:24:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so I'm gonna ask you to stand up and go around to the back of the chair. And now hold on to the chair as if Marion is sitting here. And then what I'd like you to do is to access, being as they were, as Wakhi(ph) was, fear-mongering, and rejecting. And what I want you to do is to take that energy and try to put that energy into Marion, and do that uh… physically, not verbally. 

00:24:55
MARION Just by holding onto the chair? 

00:24:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Just, yeah, just do it with your hands, like you're being rejecting, and you're being, and you're making her fearful. And just do it with your, with your hands, your body shake the chair, do whatever it is that would represent. Your body communicating to her, you can't. 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Well! And now do it again and remember how they did and you're communicating fear and rejection and you can't. You'll fail. And this time do it with just a sound, the guttural sound, not a word uh… some sound. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, stop for a moment. Terrible, terrible! You must feel awful. And you know, you really weren't even seeing Marion. And you were just venting tremendous energy. Okay, come around please. Okay, now just shake off that energy for a moment. Okay, come, come over here and sit here in my seat. 

00:26:40
MARION Okay. 

00:26:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Now as awful as it is, because I want to understand that energy, I'm going to go over there and trying to, try to represent it. And I want you to look and see as I try to represent that. All right. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:05
JEFFREY ZEIG What did that look like to you? 

00:27:10
MARION Uh… to me, what may be sad, it looked like umm… infinite rage kind of thing. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Rage, yeah? 

00:27:20
MARION Yeah. Umm… futility. 

00:27:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Futility? I know. Like an agitated energy. But let me come over here and consult with you on this because when, when I was looking at that part over there, it just looked… infantile. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:45
MARION Yeah. 

00:27:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? It was not directed. It didn't have any clear message. It just, you know, like to me, that energy was like… 

00:27:55
MARION I'm wondering what I just signed up for. 

00:28:00
JEFFREY ZEIG You know, you're being very open. And you're giving yourself an opportunity to accomplish something more global for yourself. 

00:28:10
MARION This is true. I'll never break my head otherwise. 

00:28:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Which is very normal that you come with a circumscribed issue and suddenly you realize that there's more global aspects to it. But by virtue of doing this, I remember seeing an episode of Star Trek… And if you remember that, in your first series, they were little morality plays. And Captain Kirk gets split into two. And one part is completely good and the other part is ha… completely uh… aggressive. And eventually, he is capable of integrating the two parts. And the doctor asks him, "Aren't you embarrassed about seeing that aggressive part of yourself?" And he says, "Oh, no, I need that part now. I'm going to be a better person for having experienced it." 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so come over here. Great. So now if something, if someone were doing, having gross motor tics. Where is the worst place to stand? 

00:29:25
MARION Uh… on their lap I guess in the way of it. 

00:29:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. In the way of it. Uh-umm… Well, just to gross motor tic. Right? It's a neurological discharge. We don't know why it's there, or what it means, but we just know that it's neurological discharge. Okay. So now what I'd like you to do is to orient yourself. Once again to your power words, orient to yourself again, to your power images, including the little girl and take a moment to be with that. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:05
JEFFREY ZEIG And you nod your head and you regulate your breathing effortlessly. And you uh… could see me. And then I would invite you to just open your hands, open your arms a little bit. And to imagine all of that aggressive limiting energy behind you and then just move forward a little bit in your chair. 

00:30:45
MARION Uh… Yeah. 

00:30:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And then stabilize yourself. 

00:30:55
[sil.] 

00:31:10
JEFFREY ZEIG What's that like? 

00:31:10
MARION Good. 

00:31:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Really good? 

00:31:15
MARION Yeah! 

00:31:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Solid? 

00:31:15
MARION Uh-hmm… Very solid. 

00:31:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Right. And you're present? 

00:31:20
MARION Um-hmm… 

00:31:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-hmm…and it may seem somehow as if the colors are more vivid or the outline of things is more distinct. Could be? 

00:31:30
MARION Yeah, may be. 

00:31:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. Umm… right. 

00:31:30
MARION I'm remembering. 

00:31:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And remembering and you're in your wah.(ph) You're in the state of equanimity. 

00:31:40
MARION Pretty much. 

00:31:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Pretty much, pretty much is good. Okay, so now what we're going to do here because you had talked about a circumscribed part of this problem, as if… We're going to do a group induction on all of these people. And I don't know that you have any experience in hypnosis. So did you start as a fundamental level or you had some experience? 

00:32:00
MARION I had some experience. 

00:32:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Some experience, you're coming, okay. So we're going to do a group induction on all of these people. And I'm gonna say a sentence and you're going to say a sentence and I'm gonna say a sentence, and you're going to say a sentence and we're going to do a double induction sequentially with all of these people. Now in order to do this right, we have to be willing to make an adequate number of perfectly good mistakes, because every good work should have a number of perfectly good mistakes. So I'm going to compete with you a little bit about making perfectly good mistakes. And they are going to enjoy being in transit. Regardless of the fact, they're going to be competing about making perfectly good mistakes because every good work should have perfectly good mistakes. 

00:32:45
MARION Okay. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? 

00:32:45
MARION It sounds good. 

00:32:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, great! So please if you would make yourself comfortable. Put yourself into a rather open position and dispense with any material, and just allow yourself to sit back. And then you can take a deep breath, so that you can follow with another easy breath. So that then you can begin to close your, close your eyes and begin to focus inside. 

00:33:25
MARION And as you let yourself at your own pace, in your own comfort level, go more deeply inside, just to the place you like to go, just for today for this moment, allow yourself to enjoy that moment. 

00:33:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And the place that you want to go, to go, you may have that concept in your mind, the place where you want to get up low, go, grow. And you can keep that concept in your mind, the place where you want to go. And there may be sounds, there maybe words, there may be images that present and represent to you the place where you want to go. And see what your inner mind gives you, and how the repository of experiences and memories and perceptions can help you to empower the place that you want to go. 

00:34:35
[sil.] 

00:34:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Just expand it. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:50
MARION Enjoying that place where you'd like to go, whether it's in your thoughts, in your mind, in your, what you hear or what flavors as I come into you, what's sounds, music whatever you attend, letting yourself be open to whatever you experience. 

00:35:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And then take some time to memorize your experience, the place that you want to go. And I don't know how you can begin to memorize that experience. And you may find that with your eyes closed, as you gently look up to the top of your head and take a deep breath that, that increases the intensity of memorizing that place that you want to go. And then you can notice the changes that happen in your body as your body accommodates the resting state? 

00:36:00
MARION And as you enjoy the state of rest and relaxation, you can decide or not to decide if you'd like to have this memory, this experience to be with you and be able to recall it. If you wouldn't want to do that at any time, any point that is safe to do so, that you just really can… 

00:36:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Bring that back effortlessly, bring that back easily. And it could be as simple as just steepling your fingers. And suddenly you remember the place that you want to grow. It could be as simple as just looking up to the top of your head, taking a deep breath, the place that you want to go. And quietly, and effortlessly, and easily, and securely, and surely and securely, and securely and surely, you might want to envision yourself in your future, envision yourself being at home with the realization of the place that you want to grow, go. And you might want to envision yourself being at work. Suddenly steepling your fingers, looking up, taking a deep breath, being in the place that you want to grow. 

00:37:25
MARION Even in place, even in exploring your resources where ever you maybe. 

00:37:35
JEFFREY ZEIG And then you can begin to bring yourself back here fully reorient yourself completely, reorient yourself fully and completely, taking one, or two, or three easy breaths. You can take one or two or three easy breaths and bring yourself back fully alert and rest and refreshed and wide-awake and energetic all over. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:05
JEFFREY ZEIG I'm not surprised that we failed. 

00:38:05
MARION I know. Everywhere I'm out… 

00:38:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Because we didn't make the requisite number of mistakes. 

00:38:10
MARION I can go from… 

00:38:10
JEFFREY ZEIG How we're gonna do a perfectly good mist… good… When we did this is, is, as goodly perfect as we can possibly do. You're… 

00:38:20
MARION Thank you. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:35
JEFFREY ZEIG We say something about where we've traveled. And we have a little bit of time to process. 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
MARION Umm… Well, it's, it's holding that place of where I want to be and holding that probably uh… to continually holding that in my space, even though I'm having feelings, even though my body is going through all these things. There's a lot of energy in there and does need to be expressed. And, umm… but I also have those pillars. And they've been with me my whole life. And they'll continue to be with me and have the solo play, my emotions. 

00:39:15
JEFFREY ZEIG You're growing edge. 

00:39:20
MARION Yeah. 

00:39:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Now umm… come over here. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:39:30
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, come over here. And I'll join you as your consultant. 

00:39:30
MARION Oh? 

00:39:35
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. Now let's imagine… 

00:39:35
MARION How are we doing, Jeffrey? 

00:39:35
JEFFREY ZEIG We're doing good. 

00:39:35
MARION Okay. 

00:39:40
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah, let's imagine that amorphous, regressed my, my words, my orientation that amorphous regressed energy, this neural discharge, right? And let's uh… imagine that we were somehow good enough hypnotists to begin to take that amorphous regressed energy and begin to morph that energy into something that can be useful. You know, the Ericksonian strategy utilization. If there's a pile of shit, there's got to be a pony in there somewhere. 

00:40:15
MARION Right, exactly. Umm… Well, umm… 

00:40:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Why don't we do a utilization strategy, you and I? And meet that at the frame of reference at which it exists. Right? So well, you know, there was a story about Dr. Erickson. And he's uh…visiting, he's making a home visit. When doctors used to make home visits… Right? And he's going with a doctor, know that a family that the doctor was from. And the doctor had a patient and this patient was uh… dying. She was dying of cancer. And she wanted to have as much comfort as she possibly could and none of the therapies of the day was working. And when Dr. Erickson walked into the room, she was chanting "Don't hurt me! Don't scare me! Don't hurt me! Don't scare me!" And Dr. Erickson was supposed to do hypnosis with her when she was "Don't hurt me! Don't scare me! Don't hurt me! Don't scare me!" So of course, Dr. Erickson being who he was, said to her, "I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna scare you. I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna scare you. I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna scare you." Meeting her at her frame of reference, he didn't say "I'm Dr. Erickson. I'm going to do hypnosis. Look at a spot on the wall. You're getting sleepy. Right? He met her at a frame of reference. So for a moment, let's meet her, that energy at its frame of reference, right, to get its attention because when he said "I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna scare you. I'm gonna hurt you. I'm gonna scare you." Finally, she said "But I don't want you to hurt me." 

00:41:50
MARION Right. 

00:41:50
JEFFREY ZEIG And what he did is, he continued. And he said "Well, I got to hurt you to help you, I'm gonna hurt you to help you, I'm gonna hurt you to help you, I'm gonna hurt you to help you. Right? So let's meet her at her frame of reference. Right? And so what we're going to do is to just do it back to her. Okay? 

00:42:05
MARION Okay, can you start? 

00:42:05
JEFFREY ZEIG Yeah. 

00:42:05
MARION Okay. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:15
JEFFREY ZEIG I didn't do that well enough? 

00:42:15
MARION No, you did fine. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
JEFFREY ZEIG Now she knows that we can speak her experience language. Not because of the pony phenomena, we've got to think that there's something in there, even that incredible energy that is now going 360 degrees spherical, that could be a laser and could be used some how to empower Marion to be able to stay in her power words and to stay with her power image because she's a furnace. And let's be sure that we channel that energy. 

00:43:05
MARION Well, I won't know how to… Well, just there's so much hot in that, there's so much force in that, there's so much energy in that and, and there is pain in that. But you can use your pain because that's how you connect. You know, what's happening for people through your pain? 

00:43:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Fantastic! So that… 

00:43:25
MARION And they know that you know and that's how we go. 

00:43:25
JEFFREY ZEIG That's how… That's what helps her too, that's would helps her empathize. 

00:43:30
MARION It is actually… I, I, I have been told that, uh… I once in a, uh… an interview at, at a Nash workshop and I was terrified. And the only thing that came up was that I couldn't remember technique. And the only thing that came out was, how much I cared. 

00:43:45
JEFFREY ZEIG How much you cared? 

00:43:45
MARION How much I cared, yeah. 

00:43:50
JEFFREY ZEIG So let's use those caring tears. So can I touch you? 

00:43:50
MARION Yeah. 

00:43:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, so let's use those caring fears and let's send her caring and that her pain allows Marion to really empathize with other people and to really understand how to care. 

00:44:10
MARION Yeah. 

00:44:10
JEFFREY ZEIG Right? But now because she doesn't speak words, she only speaks gestures and sounds. Let's do something that represents helping her to feel that, that amorphous energy can be focused in some way that represents a useful furnace for Marion to be able to empathize and care. And we need to do that with a gesture and verbally. So, so how, how can we represent that a little bit and start to orient her in the direction that is, rather than… 

00:44:45
MARION I'm not sure if you mean like that. 

00:44:50
JEFFREY ZEIG Okay, okay, great. So let's do it. Okay. And let's make a sound that goes along with that. 

00:45:05
[sil.] 

00:45:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And that allows us to do… 

00:45:15
[sil.] 

00:45:20
JEFFREY ZEIG And to be able to resonate… 

00:45:20
MARION Uh-hmm… 

00:45:20
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-hmm… 

00:45:20
MARION Yeah. 

00:45:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And I don't know how long it will take her to begin, to get that realization. Because truthfully, when I was sitting here and I was seeing that discharge, right? 

00:45:35
MARION Yeah. 

00:45:35
JEFFREY ZEIG That I had so much compassion for her, that she was locked into something that was really un-adaptive and hasn't had the opportunity to release and to mature and to use that energy. And I have to believe that she really wants to be able to use that energy in some way that is constructive. And maybe we set a little chaotic seed, a little chaotic moment that begins to get her to feel… 

00:46:10
[sil.] 

00:46:15
JEFFREY ZEIG So that she can… Yeah? Okay, so come back to your place. Okay, I'm watching the time because I have to be sensitive to the next speaker. So I'm sorry for that. Okay, so then begin to use that and begin to imagine that, that she starts with this seeming tantrum of amorphous, aggressive, pained energy. And that gradually, securely, truly and securely, she begins to suddenly get the idea of… 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And my association which I hope to have some relevance to you, is that I've just thought of a poem and the poem is by Kenneth Patchen. And it's a one line poem, that's the whole poem. And the poem is "Caring is the only daring." That's the entire poem. 

00:47:35
MARION Thank you for that. 

00:47:40
JEFFREY ZEIG So take a deep breath, close your eyes for a minute and hear in your mind, in your tones, "caring is the only daring." In such a way that, that can be secured itself into your power words, power images. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:10
JEFFREY ZEIG And that you can begin to sense in the body of your experience, the grace, the gratitude, the blessing of caring is the only daring. And give yourself the nod and you appreciate approval to realize that personal meaning that, that can have for you. 

00:48:40
MARION It does! 

00:48:40
JEFFREY ZEIG It does. All right. So, you know, the process now just, because we have to come to a conclusion. And you have just done something that's tantamount to abdominal surgery. You can rid up something here. 

00:48:55
MARION It feels that way. Yes. 

00:49:00
JEFFREY ZEIG Yes. So if you just done abdominal surgery, we certainly don't want you out in the garden, rooting around and trying to plant new flowers. All right. So what I'm going to ask which is all of the people here to cooperate, which is to not support you, or not ask you questions, or not do anything, uh… but just give you time to let things… You know, after lunch, if you're ready, and you're interested and people want to ask you about things, then okay, but for now or even tomorrow morning would be better. Just to have 24 hours to just chill and allow what we've done to percolate and settle, uh-hmm… and be with it and not have to disturb it in any way. So I'll ask you to just be… 

00:49:55
MARION It sounds like really good advice. 

00:49:55
JEFFREY ZEIG Being is a good advice. Right. Uh-hmm… right. Okay, that's great. And then the second part of that is that, I would really like to hear from you and I would be glad. Where do you live? You don't live… 

00:50:05
MARION In Vermont. 

00:50:10
JEFFREY ZEIG In Vermont, so I would be very glad if you send me an email in a week, and tell me how you process things, and what this meant to you and…? 

00:50:15
MARION I may glad too. 

00:50:15
JEFFREY ZEIG Uh-hmm… that would be great, so I would appreciate that. And then the third part of that is, I just want to say thanks. 

00:50:25
MARION Oh! 

00:50:25
JEFFREY ZEIG And that you've been so open, and available, and willing to expose some parts of yourself because you really want to heal and you really want to grow, and you really want to feel your power and own your power and be able to do the things that you want to in the most adaptive way. 

00:50:45
MARION Right on. 

00:50:45
JEFFREY ZEIG Right on.
