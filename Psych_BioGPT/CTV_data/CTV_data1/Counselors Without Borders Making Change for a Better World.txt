Counselors Without Boarders: 

00:00:35
Making Change for a Better World 

00:00:35
Fred Bemak, Ed.D. And Rita Chi-Ying Chung, Ph.D. George Mason University 

00:00:35
Dr. Allen E. Ivey Professor Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 

00:00:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Fred and Rita. It's a real honor to interview you today. I'm very, feel very lucky that I was asked to talk with you. Uh, there's nobody in the field that I admire more than the two of you. I see this as a real opportunity to share what you're doing, how you got where you are, and how we might move on to the future so thank you very much for being here this, today. I really appreciate it. So. What is this thing called Counselors Without Borders? 

00:01:20
Dr. Fred Bemak Dr. Rita Chi-Ying Chung George Mason University; Counselors Without Borders 

00:01:20
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Counselors Without Borders is an organization that I started, and then Rita and I have been working on, to focus on working with post-disaster issues. It's a, it's an organization that started after Katrina in 2005, when the federal government, when the red cross, when FIMA, when the response, the mental health response, every response, including the mental health response, was very poor. And, and we started to think about, how can we help? How can we help, particularly since counselors and psychologists were not, were not in the field doing the work. They couldn't access that situation. 

00:02:10
[music] 

00:02:10
In response to mental health counseling needs not being met, Counselors Without Borders was founded. The first team went to the gulf cost to provide intensive counseling following hurricane Katrina. The team was comprised of Dr. Bemak, Dr. Chung and 16 graduate students from George Mason University. 

00:02:10
New Orleans post-Katrina 

00:02:10
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. We saw well over a thousand clients in, uh, in ten days we were there. We're... 

00:02:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY A thousand clients, 10 days. 

00:02:35
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. 10 days. We brought a team of students, graduate students from George Mason University and we provided intensive supervision for the students. Every day we worked 10 to 12 hours. Every night, two to three hours supervision. It was life changing for every single student involved and, and we did tremendous work. Saw, uh, about 1,200 clients if I remember correctly. We, we kept count. 

00:03:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Now Rita, in terms of that, what were some of your observations, particularly of the student learning in this and what, how they performed? 

00:03:10
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG This is the first time, I think, that, that we've taken students out in a post-disaster site. And it was, I think an incredible experience for them and they will tell you that this is, you can't compare this to your classroom (Inaudible ). One of the things that strucked them was that they were able to put into practice what they learned in the classroom and also experience first hand in terms of disaster counseling and things that you may need to do a little bit different from traditional, individual, um, sessions. For example, even when we went down there in, um, Katrina, we were working in the disaster relief centers. These are the big centers. These are the centers which are similar to a big K-Mart that's been gutted out and what happens is that the federal government has set up, uh, stations, whether for housing, for food, for a combination. People are sitting in line. There was one, uh, booth that was called crisis counseling. No one came. And, uh, (Inaudible ) and, uh, Red Cross had said, we don't need you here because no one requires any mental health counseling. Look at all the lines for food. Look at all the lines for housing. No one is lining up for mental health counseling. I took a look at the sign and I said to a student, you know why, don't we? It's a stigma. Well who would line up for crisis counseling? So we pulled the sign down and we put support services, okay. And these students would say to me, okay, what do I do now? And I said mingle. They said, what do you mean mingle? They are use to clients coming to see them. Knocking on their door. And I said, no, this is not an ordinary set up. People are lining up for housing and for, for, for other, um, resources. Connect with them. I said, you're counselors, you know how to connect. And they immediately, within several seconds, connected with people. Just simple questions. How are you doing? How are you doing? What's happening? And before they knew it, people were telling their stories. 

00:05:10
Diana, Fatma, and To ra are George Mason graduate students who participated in Counselors Without Boarders. They share their stories as part of this video project. 

00:05:10
FATMA And people were just ready to talk about their experiences. I mean, we also learned in school, it takes you two to three sessions, you know, to establish report and be, have people open up to you. But in this experience it was completely different. Not being in the office. Having people there ready to talk about it and it was kind of like waiting for someone to say, you know, how are you doing. 

00:05:30
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG I really think that, in our field, that we need to be real flexible and creative. We already know the numerous amount of research that talk about stigma in terms of reaching, uh, mental health services or any counseling services. We need to get past that. I think we need to be out there reaching out to the community and working with people in the community versus them coming into an office. And often times, what we found in the disaster situation is people said, I, I, I would have never gone to a counselor. I don't believe counseling was like this. For me, counseling was always a sterile, forced stigma. But, you know, you get, you guys seems human even or it's great talking to you. Uh, in fact, a lot of the people faint out on counselors. They have never told their story. 

00:06:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY What did you find on your arrival when you got there? 

00:06:20
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Chaos. 

00:06:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Chaos. 

00:06:20
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Total chaos. We, we arrive three months after Katrina, in November. The week before Thanksgiving. And we were, everyone was shocked. We were shocked ourselves. It looked as if Katrina had just hit. There were, um, everything was in just disarray. We have houses and boats in the middle of the road, wires were, were down. It, it, like a disaster site. 

00:06:45
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Military were patrolling everywhere. Um, the, there were no facilities. The restaurant, there were no restaurants. There were no supermarkets. Um, everything was destroyed. We actually wound up, the state of Mississippi housed us in a juvenile detention facility. And we formed a whole sense of community. Cooking together, meeting together, talking together and then deploying out to five different sites along the entire gulf coast every day, uh, with different teams. And then Rita and I would go back and forth supervising, by phone, um, crisis situations. And then at night, we'd have intensive two to three hour supervision. 

00:07:30
TO RA Supervision was tough. Um, we were able to keep journals and, uh, we were sharing our, our day in our journals but, um, supervision was more so, um, to talk about our, our, our events and, and our day but I think it was more so to deal with the inside of us. With our internal, um, struggles and a lot, a lot came out in supervision. Things that I didn't would, would come out and, um, which was very difficult but it also made it easier to go out the next day. Because you were able to let go of, of your biases and, and your issues and, um, and our supervisors didn't allow us to, you know, be under the radar. Uh, they're very, very, uh, transparent and wanted us to be transparent as well. So, um, I think supervision was important. We wouldn't have been able to done it, to do it without it. 

00:08:30
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. And when we, when we go onto a site in post disaster, we work on multiple levels. We provide direct support. We train some of the existing professionals in the area that may have professional mental health degrees but don't have the skill sin post disaster. And then we meet with administration to help figure out, um, how to manage the larger situation. In, on the gulf coast, I regularly met with the officials who were coordinating the entire mental health interventions for the gulf coast. Inevitably, at every meeting I would go to, about 15 people sitting around a table trying to think, how are we going to most strategically meet the needs. People would cry around the table. They'd lost their homes. They'd lost their cars. They'd lost their transport. They were in the same situation as everyone else. So it's a very intense situation. 

00:09:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I'd like each of you just to relax a moment and get an image in your mind of a specific case or experience that you each had in that setting that was important to you. 

00:09:40
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. I'm going to Haiti for this. The image is this 7 year old girl. We, we were working with, in one school, training the staff, how do you work with the students and one 7 year old girl was drawing pictures. And we learned from the person who'd invited us, the head of the school, Porter Prints. Um, a leader in the field of education who is trying to, how can we do this better, said this child lost her mother and here's the story. The earthquake came, January. The girl was standing here. The mother was standing here. The girl and mother were talking with each other, yelling to each other. The earth was shaking. The girl said, Mommy, Mommy, I'm scared. Please come. The mother said no, no, no. You come to me. No Mommy, you come. I'm scared. I can't, you come, you. And then suddenly the walls fell and the girl watched Mommy die. This girl was so pained and had such, this is the image that comes, so difficult and Rita worked with her in a group for a while then I brought her along and I kept her with me all day. I just had my arm on her. I had her drawing. Every group in ran, I'd touch base with her. Are you okay now? Oh that's a good drawing. Oh that's, oh that looks like a, tell me about the drawing. All day, she tagged along. Um, very painful and just a sweet young 7 year old. But that's the image that jumped up for me. 

00:11:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I gotta tell you, as you talk, that I kinda feel tears coming to my eyes. 

00:11:25
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Yes, very. 

00:11:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I would , if I wanted to do the DCT thing, I would ask for more see, hear, feeling. I'd have you in tears so I'm not going to do that. I got, I'm in tears myself. 

00:11:30
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. It's, it's. 

00:11:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I can really feel it. It must have been, like, incredibly powerful stuff. 

00:11:35
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Yes. 

00:11:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I don't know if I can take your story but (Inaudible ). 

00:11:45
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Right. It's interesting because as you soon as you said image, I had multiple images from even just the site but also the smell. And I want to go to San Diego. Um. 

00:11:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And, and the smell even? 

00:11:55
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Yes, the smell. Um, in 2007, after the San Diego wildfires, we took a team, counselor reports, and we partnered with San Diego State University. 

00:12:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mmm, hmm. 

00:12:05
Entering La Jolla Indian Reservation 

00:12:05
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG And one of, all the mountains, everywhere we went in San Diego was totally destroyed. And you could smell it. That, that, that, it, it just smoked as if things had been burning. It was in your hair, it was on your clothes, it affected your eyes. And we actually worked in areas where Red Cross and Fima were, were not. Such as the migrant communities, um, and the Native American reservations where 90 percent of the reservation was destroyed. And I remember going out, driving out to the reservation and looking at it and really felt devastated because everything was just black. 

00:12:40
DIANA When we got to, um, San Diego, it just started when, you know, the affluent neighborhoods are and then you started going on (Inaudible ) and you start seeing the brown and the black mountains, and the smell, and the smoke, and it's, it's just a really profound image of devastation and no one's there. Um, it's, it's really sad. 

00:13:10
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG We were, on our way up, there was a school bus and it didn't even look like a school bus. It just looked like a whole, just a (Inaudible ) of metal. And, as we drove out, there was a sign that was written by charcoal and it said we believe in miracles. And immediately I thought, wow, the strength of this community. Before we could work there we had to meet with the counsel of elders. And they basically looked at us and thought, why should we trust you. They said, we are use to devastation. We are use to promises and being let down. So we, at, our team, we met with the counsel of elders for half a day. The cooked food for our students. We, we talked and we, we established credibility and then they gave us permission to go onto the reservations. One of the things that, I think, that gets me very emotional is when I hear, not only at the native reservations but with the migrant communities, when they said that the fire, they could see the fire coming and it was getting closer and closer, they were called on the telephone to ask for help. No one would answer. They, they would say, no, no, we're sorry. We, we don't have time. Because they were focusing more on the, what they all the news stations were focusing on, which is La Jolla, or the, the rich areas. The news, the news, the media forgot about the poor areas. And... 

00:14:30
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I never heard a word about the idea that a reservation was destroyed. I heard about the big homes. I saw the pictures of the big homes. 

00:14:35
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Exactly. Well, even the migrant communities and the poor migrant communities, especially the, the ones, um, close to the Mexican border. Children would say, we could see the fire coming. No one would help us. We didn't know what to do so we tried to outrun the fire. And some people unfortunately couldn't make it. They described the bodies that they saw that was burned. I don't even, I don't even have the words for what they saw. The animals crying because of the fire. It was just so painful to watch. And at the same time, while our team was driving up to provide services, we were stopped numerous time by immigration to check on us, to check on our papers. Especially with myself that I don't look the typical white Americans. The team, some of our teams are Latino. Um, one person came up. She is a Muslim American. We got stopped regularly on our way there, on our way back. We didn't cross the border. We were still in the USA but we got stopped, checked to make sure we weren't illegal. 

00:15:50
[music] 

00:15:50
Culturally Responsive Disaster Mental Health 

00:15:50
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. The entire focus of this, of this organization is to be culturally responsive, is to, to work in a way that's not the western, European American, individual psychological approach that really doesn't have much merit in post disaster situations. So it's a culturally responsive, um, teams. Many times we, we bring people with multiple languages, multiple language skills, cultural sensitivity. Um, everyone we bring is trained very carefully in terms of cultural awareness, um, and social justice interventions. That's an emphasis that ties in with learning, how can you actually get permission to work on a reservation. We worked on two reservations actually which the news didn't portray. We worked in the very poor communities with very culturally diverse ethnic, ethnically and racially diverse populations. Um, there was, there weren't people there doing that work. 

00:16:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY How do we expand what you're doing to have more people involved? And what can other people do using you two as a model? 

00:17:00
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Counselors Without Borders is replicable. It's, it's not magic. It's not, uh, something that someone else couldn't pick up and run with. Um, I get quarries weekly from people who say, can I join, can I volunteer. Um, I think there's tremendous heart in the counseling profession. People wanting to give back, not knowing how to do it or having the infrastructure to do it. Taking some of the existing work that is going on in the field, uh, in post disaster work, looking at how that is applied in terms of cultural responsiveness, training students to work within our own communities, training students, um, to go out in to other settings and work when there's a need. Um, I think people can do that at any university in the country. 

00:18:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I think the next thing that might be good for us to focus on is marginalize communities, the people that can not get to as many services as others and I think this is a really, very, very important part of your work. Where would you like to go with that? 

00:18:10
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. I, I think, there are so many examples of this, where we look at San Diego and what we, going to San Diego, and we look at what the news media portrayed. The very wealthy areas, the big homes. We didn't see and many of us didn't even know that the poor communities were suffering as a result of the wildfires. In, in Katrina, we didn't see the poor communities, the effect of the poor communities, in the media. So this, this emphasis on affluence and services and services to the affluent populations, I think, really becomes pronounced in a post disaster situation where it's not even part of what's portrayed. Counselors Without Borders is, we designed this to reach out to the poor communities, to reach out to the disenfranchised communities, to be culturally responsive and to, to head, head into these areas where people aren't receiving any services at all. 

00:19:15
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Another example, I think, of looking at discrimination and inequity and (Inaudible ) issues in post disasters is that some of the signs in English, the signs in English said, from Fima saying, um, you need to go to your community for resources. This is in English. In Spanish it said no food, no water here with no direction in terms of where, where to go for people who did not read or speak English. Okay. When we, we talked to the Indian reservation, I, yes there was one Fima trailer with resources and the gentleman, bless his heart, he did volunteer. He was sitting on a deck chair, laid back like this, as students came up. And he said, you don't need to come here. There's no one here. They don't need our services. But, by the way, can you take a photo of me. I'm in a, in an Indian reservation. My students were appalled and I, and the students said, what do I do. I said, walk the reservation. They walked for miles carrying bottle of water, knocking on doors, giving water to the people. 

00:20:20
FATMA We were walking from one door to another, one house to another. It was scary at the beginning because you have loose dogs and, um, you don't know what to expect but it's just feeling of that, you know, you want to help. Maybe someone is there, not really going to the centers where they can receive help and maybe does not know even about it. 

00:20:40
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG They were welcome and then again the stories came out. Over the pain, the loss. 

00:20:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mmm hmm. 

00:20:45
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG But they walked the reservation. You don't find that in a counseling theory book, do you? 

00:20:55
[music] 

00:20:55
Fred responds to some of the criticism surrounding Counselors Without Borders 

00:20:55
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Some of the criticism that we've heard is, what about confidentiality. What about, uh, privacy? What about single session interventions? How can that possibly work? Every, all the rules in post disaster work change. 

00:21:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mmm hmm. 

00:21:20
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. And we have to accommodate the situation, not accommodate our theories. Um, there have been criticisms. How can you bring students who aren't fully trained to a disaster site? 

00:21:30
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Or who are not licensed. 

00:21:30
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Who are not licensed, they don't have. Um, our, our perception was this, the human recourse capacity to work in these environments isn't enough. 

00:21:40
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Oh, absolutely. 

00:21:45
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. And so, because of these restrictions, we've been short changing ourselves, saying, giving a message to the people in those communities we don't have enough resources to come and attend to you. Rita and I don't believe in that. So, we've said, just like a field placement, a practicum or an internship site, in counseling or psychology, we can go out to the field. We're licensed. We can supervise. Just like people supervise on site when people get, when students get training. And that expands immensely our, our human resource capacity. So we provide intensive supervision as a critical component and the students have been phenomenal. 

00:22:30
FATMA Many people, especially the grad, um, students, think that their not ready to do counseling. Um, they think, oh my God, I don't have the skills but they will, they will be surprised when they throw themselves in the experience how much they know. And you will never learn a lot about yourself until you are in that moment, working with someone else. And it's really great, what I (Inaudible ), it's, as I said, not solving the problem but just instilling that small hope. 

00:22:55
TO RA I thought it was also important to understand, um, that you can learn from others. And while, to a certain extent, we were in an authoritative figure, uh, position. However, I learned from the children and from, you know, the young people that resilience. I learned the resilience and the, and how they were able to, to beat the odd and while I was there to help them, they actually helped me in the process as well. 

00:23:25
[music] 

00:23:25
Training required to participate in Counselors Without Borders 

00:23:25
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG What one of the, the criterias for them to come down is that they must be advanced students with advanced skills, um, have taken a multicultural class. We also have a social justice class. So that's the basic requirements. And then what we do, we do a two day training, in terms of looking at, not only the skills, I think it's just as important to look at the culture, the community that we're going in to. What are some of the historical, social, political, um, uh, perspectives as well. Because we need to go in there understanding the, um, community that we're working with. We need to understand why the Native Americans will not welcome us. We need to understand and appreciate and accept the historical, political perspective as well. We also mat at the airport. We did training on the airport. We did training on, on, on the plane. We did training when we, we, got, got there. And when we arrive at disaster sites, one of the things I think is important is for us to tour the sites. 

00:24:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mmm Hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG To actually get an understanding visually as well, in terms of the devastation so students can put it in perspective when they, um, talk to survivors. 

00:24:35
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY We often know the counselors themselves are traumatized. 

00:24:40
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Right, right. 

00:24:45
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And, what do you do with your students cause some of them must have been pretty upset... 

00:24:45
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Sure. 

00:24:50
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY With what happened to them. What do you do as trainers to help them deal with these incredibly new and dramatic things that they're facing and their own hurt and feeling as they live with this? 

00:24:55
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Uh, that's a great, um, question and I, we hear this all the time. What about self care? How do you, and in fact, in one of my presentations someone asked me from the audience, how do you feed your soul. And I thought what a great way of, of, of explaining. 

00:25:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY How do you feed your soul? 

00:25:10
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG How do you feed your soul. Okay. We do, and as part of the model, we do intensive supervision and debriefing every night after we've had dinner we will go for even two to four hours. And these supervisions are multiple levels. It's for them to, for students to, it's not really looking at skills but it's for students to talk and express what they, they've seen. And often times, there'll be a lot of tears and pain, uh, when you start to hear stories, as you said, over and over again. We do a lot of, um, fun things as well. We, you know, in terms of any way to, to relieve stress. Whether, whether we sing. We have celebrations if it happens to be someones birthday, so we make sure that we celebrate birthdays. We form a massage chair where we all go around massaging each other. But we definitely emphasis, to our students, self care and it's important. 

00:26:00
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY So, the thing is the counselors not operating alone. He's operating in this, he or she is operating in a support system... 

00:26:10
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Yes. 

00:26:10
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY and you do bring out the feeling. They tell their stories, reflect on them and... 

00:26:15
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Right. 

00:26:15
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY In the process of that, they learn a lot about the system. 

00:26:20
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Right. And they learn about themselves as well. 

00:26:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY And themselves. Important, powerful learning tool. Freddy, your turn. 

00:26:25
Figure 1: Disaster Cross-Cultural Counseling (DCCC) Model PHASE I: Explore existing coping strategies Begin a sense of psychological safety PHASE II: Learn new coping skills PHASE III: Combining old and new coping skills Foster sense of hope, purpose and mastery PHASE IV: Deeper integration of pre and post-disaster coping skills Psychological stability Deeper sense of meaning and purpose Develop short/long term future goals PHASE V: Group Supervision Working with countertransference Clinical supervision and self development Infusing social justice action 

00:26:25
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. In the, in the, in the model, with the supervision, we actually have broken it down into three different areas. It, it, supervision being one, one dimension of the model. Part of the supervision is clinical skills and training. A second dimension is counter transference. What issues has this stirred up for you? What are you experiencing? How are you reacting to these painful, difficult stories? And the third dimension is, how do we infuse social justice into the work we're doing that, because there's quite a bit of inequity that happens and that gets exaggerated during post disaster. So that's, I have to say Rita, I think this accurate, every night of supervision, seven days a week, there are tears. Every night. People coming back with those stories but then there's a healing that happens daily and people are ready to get up again and go for another 12 hour day. 

00:27:25
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG But there's, but, sorry, I didn't mean to, but these are, I mean, when, when you hear, hear this, every day there are tears, I mean, these are healthy tears and believe it or not, it re-energizes them and they're eager to go. And in fact, after, whether it's the San Diego wildfires or even after Katrina, the team did not want to leave. They would, they would say, if I knew what I know now, I would have signed up for another couple weeks. I want to stay.

00:27:55
Disaster Cross Cultural Counseling Model 

00:27:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY I understand that you have a formal model and Rita, you're gonna tell us about the formal model that goes with this. 

00:28:05
Figure 1: Disaster Cross-Cultural Counseling (DCCC) Model PHASE I: Explore existing coping strategies Begin a sense of psychological safety 

00:28:05
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG The model has five phases and the first phase, just real briefly is, um, really working with the clients with the survivors in terms of looking at existing coping skills. Um, in a disaster situation everything is disarray. People feel out of control, feel helplessness. So one of the things, in terms of getting some control to life, is what are the usual coping skills that you do and can't we incorporate them now. So it's really going back to their basic coping skills. Do you want to do second and we'll just go back and forth. Yeah. 

00:28:40
PHASE II: Learn new coping skills 

00:28:40
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. We'll go back and forth. Second, second dimension of this model is really what new skills do you need. You have a different circumstance, very different circumstances, different situation. What new skills do you need to handle your new situation? 

00:28:55
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Mmm hmm. 

00:28:55
PHASE III: Combining old and new coping skills Foster sense of hope, purpose and mastery 

00:28:55
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG And then also, um, remember, some of the, your coping strategies that normally have pre-disaster may not be effective anymore. For example, talking to people. They may not be there. They could have died or you're on the phone or the phone line, line, lines are down. So things that you normally utilize in terms of coping may not be available so therefore we now talk about what are some of the new strategies that you can use. So, that's phase two. Phase three is let's integrate both the, your new and the old. And it's kind of interesting because, often times, we work in groups and not necessarily do individual sessions and it's very powerful because the group members or the survivors will start to share like, well, you know what, that's a good idea. I never thought that I, I, I can sing or I can, uh, utilize other type of coping skills. So it's a brain storming session going on between the survivor sharing their coping strategies as well as learning new coping strategies. 

00:29:55
PHASE IV: Deeper integration of pre and post-disaster coping skills Psychological stability Deeper sense of meaning and purpose Develop short/long term future goals 

00:29:55
PHASE V: Group Supervision Working with countertransference Clinical supervision and self development Infusing social justice action 

00:29:55
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. And the, the next, the fourth phase is really a deepening of that, of, of, because, the, at first it's more superficial. People are, are struggling. Their circumstances are difficult. There's a lot of pain and trauma and, and worry and anxiety. And the fourth phase really takes those three first phases and deepens them and really crystallizes that for them and starts to help them look at some of the trauma, some of the more difficult, uh, emotional reaction, um, some of the losses, some of the pain. And, and it also instill, there's a piece in that fourth phase that really starts to look at hope. What's, what's beyond all this and, and what's, where's the light at the end of the tunnel. And then the fifth phase comes into the supervision which we just described with the three different phases. And so we really have been working from that frame work from a culturally responsive perspective and helping people and, and it's, it's given students and given our teams a frame work to work in, in these very difficult circumstances. 

00:31:05
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Well, all of this doesn't happen with just with the two of you. There has to be some institutional support and I'm impressed by the way that you can work with the system within the system in new and innovative ways. What, what are you getting in terms of institutional support in this whole process? 

00:31:20
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY We have had incredible institutional support and again, I suggest to my colleagues around the country, um, you too can, can talk to your administration about supporting activities like this. Um, this tape was introduces by the provost of George Mason University, Peter Stearns. He has been spectacular in saying this is something that we should do. This is something that has meaning, has purpose, um, and is critical to give back to our community. He has funded this, this program. The deans at our, at our college have given full support for this. Um, we have hit no, absolutely no road blocks in the institutional backing. We also work within our, within our program, within our department, we have worked it out with all the students and the faculty. There's no restriction. People are given extended deadlines for work. When we go out to a site, and we go for a week and a half, two weeks, um, everybody works with the students and we be, we call ourselves a community of caring, not just the Counselors Without Borders team that goes out. So when we went, when we've gone, we have numbers of students who drive all the different team members to the airport. We have some of the, uh, some of the other students who are watering plants and taking care of pets. We generate an entire community that's participating in Counselors Without Borders. Any university can do this. 

00:33:00
[music] 

00:33:00
Dr. Peter Stearns, Provost at George Mason university, shares his thoughts about Counselors Without Borders 

00:33:00
"How does one create a university environment that fosters the type of work like Counselors Without Borders?" 

00:33:00
DR. PETER STEARNS That's a great question. I'm not sure one does create an environment to the extent there's any creation involved. It's, first of all, being flexible, being responsive to faculty interests and then trying to encourage faculty, trying to hire faculty who have these interests deeply ingrained in their own, uh, professional mission. 

00:33:40
[music] 

00:33:40
"How has Counselors Without Borders played a role in the mission of George Mason University?" 

00:33:40
DR. PETER STEARNS Well, I don't want to overstate this but, um, we have been self consciously trying to develop a global presence, outreach on a number of fronts, and Counselors Without Borders is obviously central to that kind of endeavor. And we're also trying to build a global, um, agenda that is responsive to needs in different parts of the worlds. And in that sense, this commitment to reaching out, to responding to need, uh, to a commitment to social justice, I think, sort of, uh, epitomizes what we're trying to do with global activities at George Mason. 

00:34:30
[music] 

00:34:30
"What are your hopes for Counselors Without Borders?" 

00:34:30
DR. PETER STEARNS Well, I hope they grow. Um, well, one one sense, one hopes that the need for them diminishes but, lets face it, the prospects there are not great in the near future so I hope the organization flourishes. I hope that they are able to follow the opportunities that are currently developing to involve increasing numbers of students, um, to develop connections with other institutions, both in the United Sates and in, uh, international sites. So, I hope they simply expand and continue to maintain the, the kind of commitment they've already developed. 

00:35:10
[music] 

00:35:10
"What would you say to other universities that want to create social justice programs like Counselors Without Borders?" 

00:35:10
DR. PETER STEARNS Well, again, I think, uh, looking for faculty who have this kind of commitment. Uh, trying to build educational programs where, uh, there's a, there's an open commitment to social justice and a, uh, uh, a sense of global collaboration. Uh, I think those are, those are two kinds of things that would be central. And then I think, um, just being willing to, to, um, participate in commitments, uh, not being afraid to have members of the university, groups within the university involved in activities that are, you know, likely to occasion some debate. I think that's an important part of the process. 

00:35:50
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. Do you want, do you want to mention the woman in the tent? Yeah. 

00:35:50
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG (crosstalk inaudible ) thinking, yeah. I, I am. I am. Yeah, yeah. (inaudible ) I thinking that, instilling hope, which I think it is mentioned but I don't think it really plays, well, sort of but I think it plays a huge role in terms of what we do and I see it time and time again. I mean, as I said, when we drove up to the Indian reservations, we believe in miracles. I mean, wow, that's hope. When we drove through Mississippi, one of the things that I noticed, as I said, everything's in disarray but they they had, someone had put up these placards and the placards had, as you drive, um, on the road, the first one had together. The next one had we will rebuild. Together. We will find a way. Together. And again, as you drive through, that message of hope was just powerful. And I think, through hope there comes a sense of control. Then comes a purpose. Then, then comes, well, I can make decisions. I think what we do, also it's not really focused on the strength but we're unearthing or uncovering the resiliency that people have. In Haiti, we, as soon as we arrive in Port Au Prince we were taken by, in a van, straight to a tent camp. The tent camps are places where people stayed and they were just a big football field just full of tents with hardly any space in between the tents. In the tents there would be probably 30 cots. In a cot, you may have a whole family in one cot. And this cot is just a normal size, what you call, a single bed. You got people squeezed up. There was one woman that they were really concerned about. She had her leg in a cast, um, and she just wouldn't get out of bed. She just refused to get out of bed. Totally, of course, totally depressed. She lost family members. The family members that she hadn't lost, she said, they won't come and visit me. 

00:37:35
DR. FRED BEMAK, ED.D. The, the three months I, this is three months after the earthquake. Sorry. 

00:37:40
DR. RITA CHI-YUNG CHUNG Right. So we talked to her and she was saying, I've got no purpose in life. There's nothing going on. Um, and as we talked, and this is a typical example, other people in the cots start to form a group and gather around and was listening to her and would say, wow, I'm so, I never heard your story. Oh my goodness. Sharing it to the story and then I looked at the woman next to me, a young girl, and I said, and who are you. She said, I'm the daughter. And she was carrying a one month year old baby. A one month baby, yeah, and she just had this child. And I said, so this is your mother. And she said yes. And I said, and I said to the woman jokingly, you told me you don't have any children left but you have this young girl, young daughter. And she said, yes, that's right. And as if, as if it clicked, she went, wait, I've got my daughter here. And I says it, does she look after you. She said yes, she does. And I said, well, you said no one look after you. And then I said, what about the baby. I said, the baby miss you. She miss her grandmother. And she looked at me and she, I said, this baby, she needs a grandmother for her, for you to show her the way of life. And she reached out for the baby. Held the baby, looked at the baby and, for a minute, she, she stared at the baby and suddenly this big smile came on her face. The daughter's crying. She said, I've never seen my mother smile since the earthquake. The woman, when we, when we saw her, she was lying in bed, remember. She actually got, force, sat up and decided that she wanted some privacy to change into a new shirt. She'd been wearing the same shirt for three months. She had hope. She had purpose. 

00:39:25
DR. ALLEN E. IVEY Final words. Fred and then Rita.
