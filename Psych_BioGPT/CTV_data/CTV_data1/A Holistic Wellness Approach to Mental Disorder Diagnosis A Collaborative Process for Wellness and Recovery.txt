ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Over the last 20 years I’ve seen so many changes in the field of mental health. A lot of this has come through rapidly increasing competition among professions. For example, psychiatry competing with the broader area of medical practice. Other forms of, uh, doctors and other medical health care professionals. Psychologists competing with psychiatrists. Social workers competing with psychologists and counselors competing with many other professions in order to not only, uh, grow in – in a bigger piece of the pie. But also to form an identity that’s different that is, uh, more able to – to help, to serve those clients that we’re trying to work with and for. In almost no other area have I seen more of an escalation of these kinds of competitive practices and – and, um, necessities in our field than diagnosis. Diagnosis of mental disorders has become the watch word of our entire profession. It’s not only a beginning, essential part of the counseling process. Diagnosis and the DSM, has really become the bible of the entire mental health field. It’s striking how rapidly this has escalated over the last 20 years. And it’s a little bit scary also. That’s why a holistic wellness approach to mental disorder diagnosis is so vital for what we do, because without a wellness holistic approach, to assessing and – and understanding our clients diagnosis can become a sterile process of just simply labeling people. Is that what we want to do? Is our job to just label somebody with a name of something that’s an illness which can be very stigmatizing for the person. And potentially follow them for the rest of their life. I don’t think so. And it’s one of the things that I’ve noticed has become more common over the last 20 years or so. A turning point was when the DSM four came out in 1994, and it defined much more concrete ways of labeling mental illness. It also vastly increased the number of mental illnesses that were diagnosable. In fact, every single successive addition of the DSM, has increased the number of diagnoses. To the point that from DSM one until now, DSM five, over 350 percent more diagnoses are at our fingertips. But, what is resulting in that, is much, much more increase, prevalence raised to the point that 50 percent almost of the American population has a diagnosable mental illness at some point. But more than that what I’ve seen over the last 20 years is sigma of client being told by clinicians that they’re ill. This is something that’s been very disheartening to me. And I think even flies in the face of mental health care. In fact, I think in many ways our health care system is not even one of health care. It’s become an illness care system. And one of the major reasons why that’s the case is because the diagnosis process has increasingly followed what’s called a medical model of care. What’s a medical model of care. Well, that is when you simply look for symptoms of an illness and you try to cure those symptoms. I have a question for you though. Do you believe that the absence of illness equals health. I don’t think so. For example, if someone is suffering from severe depression to the point they can’t get out of bed in the morning. It’s impacting their relationships with other people. They’re in extreme distress daily. If those symptoms were reduced, and the person no longer technically met the criteria of major depressive disorder, for example, would that mean that that person is healthy. No. It just might mean that they don’t have a diagnosable illness. It may not help the person prevent future illness. It certainly may not lead to happiness. Simply the absence of illness does not equate to health. So how do you combat that kind of perspective with a different perspective. A holistic wellness approach to mental disorder diagnosis. This actually is a different perspective on how to view people that we serve. The people that we call our clients. And it will significantly reduce the chance of stigmatizing them and not only through other stigma, but reinforcing their own self stigma. I think of a client that I had. Her name was Donna. She was about 50 years old at the time. Short woman. Short grayish hair. She had what we call schizophrenia. She was diagnosed at a very early age. In her teens. Throughout her life, she was told that she was ill. She came to me pleading the first time I met her as a mental health professional, not to call her a schizophrenic. It really hit my heart that everyone in the past she told me, simply labeled her as a schizophrenic and it defined who she was as a human being to the rest of the world. I remember her crying about this as she talked to me about how horrible she felt, how she felt less than, how she felt damaged. And I remember thinking, isn’t it our job as mental health professionals to help empower our clients. And to work towards holistic growth, happiness and a difference sense of who they are in the world. So they’re not only more functional, but so they’re actually well. It was a long process of treatment with her. And really it was one of the starting points of me, which changed my perspective in how to work with clients versus thinking about working on them. As a therapist labeling them and trying to fix their ills. In order to have a holistic wellness approach, a different perspective, first of all it’s important to understand that people are not simply an illness. People are not aschizophrenic. People are not borderline. As I hear so often. I also hear people say, this client is bipolar. Not that they are a friend. Or a sibling or a son or a daughter or a coworker etcetera. They are bipolar. And you start seeing somebody through that lenses and then, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy everything that they do, everything that they say fits into this box of a label that you have imposed on them. I believe and what I’ve seen over the last 20 years is it’s much more effective to work collaboratively with clients to focus on wellness and to focus on the person that you’re working with holistically. So, how do you do that. The first step is understanding clients from a bio-psycho-social spiritual perspective. We all have an impact on our physiology when there are mental health issues. There’s always a psychological component of that. And always there are social consequences. For many people it might also relate to our spiritual health or impact our spirituality in some way. The more we can understand bio, psycho, social, spiritual, underpinnings of what leads to our client’s concerns, the more we could treat them in a truly person centered human way. And collaborate with them towards their own growth and development. I find this to be so refreshing especially in an age of just focusing on symptoms. Just trying to find the illness so we can come from the outside and fix it, for them. The reason I like that so much is it’s not only liberating for clients, but it helps clients become their own therapists. And in my opinion this is one of the most powerful things that we could do for those that we’re trying to serve. Image that. Not only just reducing symptoms. But helping clients become their own therapists. So in the future, they can guide their own treatment process and we could put ourselves out of business. That’s what I think should be every clinicians goal. But we need to approach it from a bio, psycho, social, spiritual perspective, in order to reach that wellness, that holistic type of healing. Self healing for the client that we develop together. Throughout my professional life, I’ve noticed how important it is that we collaborate with clients and we have a strength based approach. This is not one thing that we do. It really pervades our entire work, it pervades the atmosphere when we’re in sessions with clients. We focus on what are some of the things that they do well. What are some of the things that have helped them. What are some of the things that have made them feel happier, have changed the way they think, have positively impacted their relationships with other people. And have lead to a more expansive, spiritual life if that suits the client. There are multi-cultural implications of this that are very positive. And more importantly it can help clients move towards wellness instead of simply focusing on their illness. It can lead to a holistic homeopathic healing process that really could be self-guided. I’m shocked by a recent study that I found in the Journal of the American Medical Association that showed 20 percent of Americans, right now, today, are taking a psychotropic medication for a mental illness. 20 percent, one out of five American. And 10 percent of Americans are on an antidepressant medication alone. That’s striking to me but it fits very well with a medical model of – of cure, not care. Because if you identify an illness and you focus simply on the symptoms, medications will be thought of as doing the job. The problem is, they’re very partial, there’s always side effects to it, and ultimately it’s not going to help the client learn how to become their own therapists and prevent the same kind of issues in the future. And I believe that’s what our job is. Thank you.

00:15:20
SHANNON DERMER  Dr. Schwartz, I’m glad you brought up this topic. Uh, I have a post modern background. And so I have a little bit of trouble sometimes with the idea of, um, diagnosis. 

00:15:40
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:15:40
SHANNON DERMER Uh, so you tell – you told that story about that woman who, um, didn’t like be labeled by her diagnosis because it became her identity in some ways. 

00:15:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:15:50
SHANNON DERMER Could you talk a little bit more about that. How we can use diagnosis, um, the label of diagnosis in a harmful or helpful way. 

00:16:00
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:16:00
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Absolutely. The key to this, is for everyone to understand that diagnosis is simply a name that we create. Diagnoses are not things. We tend to think of them as things. We somehow reify them as they’re tangible things that we could hold or touch. But actually, these are simply just labels that we create in our society for the purpose of identifying human suffering. Now I think that that’s a much more positive way to understand them. It’s a more positive way to work with clients. To think about what is the suffering that they’re experience. How can I understand that together with them and work towards growth and development. Towards wellness. Not thinking of diagnosis as a label that’s tangible that I only need to focus on curing. It’s a very different perspective. 

00:17:00
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:17:00
SHANNON DERMER Well, I like that. There’s a book that I had that I got when I was a doctoral student, they made us read. I mean I enjoyed reading it. They made us read it and it called Metaphors of, um, Family Therapy or Family Systems Theory. And the – the basic – the basis of the book was to point out things that we tend to think of as real or tangible that really are just metaphors. So like a diagnosis is a metaphor for the signs and symptoms that we might see. And then, uh, we can talk – we – we label this metaphor so we can talk about it, the impact of it on someone’s life. 

00:17:35
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:17:35
SHANNON DERMER Um, like boundaries. They were talking about boundaries. We talk about boundaries as if they are tangible things that actually exist. But really it’s just a metaphor to describe forms of communication and levels of communication. 

00:17:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:17:45
SHANNON DERMER So, if – and in narrative therapy, they would talk about that the, um, that people aren’t problems. Problems are problems. And it sounded like that that’s what your client was asking for. Don’t label me a problem, talk about my problem. 

00:18:05
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yeah. 

00:18:05
SHANNON DERMER Which is separate from me. And how it might influence my life and my relationships. 

00:18:10
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:18:10
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. And isn’t that what it’s all about. Is really working with the human being who’s suffering and understanding them as a person. I talked about the term holistic. And we all suffer. But most of us do not want to be labeled as a personality disorder. Or as a psychotic disorder. It’s much more – I think, healthy, not only for the client, but for us as therapists, it’s much more healthy to see our clients as someone who suffering from something that we call a mood disorder. Or struggling with something that we call a psychotic disorder. That may change. It may be, you know, it may come and go. It may get more severe or less severe. But it – it’s a fluid process that is something that we create simply to identify how to help them. One thing that I – it’s always struck with me is something Freud said, himself. He said the diagnosis is just like scaffolding around a building. It provides an initial structure so you could build the foundation and start working on the interior. And once that scaffolding is not needed any more, focus on the meat of it. Which in our case is the person. 

00:19:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:45
SHANNON DERMER That’s a really – I actually hadn’t heard that example before. But I like it because I think one of the dangers of diagnosing and thinking of the person as their diagnosis is that we think everyone with, like, say the label of schizophrenia, they’re only capable of these things and that is who we are. Versus we know that people – anyone diagnosed with schizophrenia they’re going to be a wide range of abilities, likes, and dislikes. There’s people with schizophrenia who become psychiatrists, there’s people with schizophrenia who become famous scientists, you know, like, uh, the movie A Beautiful Mind where they talk about the – you know, he became a scientist and had – and schizophrenia was one part of his life. 

00:20:20
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yeah. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER  But I like that idea of scaffolding around a building. Just because something’s labeled a building doesn’t mean that every building needs to look exactly alike. And it’d be a boring world if that’s what we assumed. 

00:20:30
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Absolutely. And so the important – the important point is to think of our clients uniquely as individuals, different from one another and to come in fresh and try to understand what they’re concerns, their struggles are together. On a human level. And I think that’s where empathy plays a vital role. The issue often with a medical model approach to mental illness is that you see clients as separate things. You see them so objectively that you almost sacrifice empathy in the process. And then what happens is, you also sacrifice a lot of what’s therapeutic about you as a professional. 

00:21:20
SHANNON DERMER I think that’s also an excellent point. I think that we assume that counselors and social workers and psychologists are good at empathy. But I think that, uh, they can fall into the same traps as a lot of other people. I, um, worked in a hospital but also recently my mom was -- my mother was hospitalized for quite a long time. And I really could tell the difference between the physicians that were focusing in on some empathy versus those who just saw her as a diagnosis and something to be treated. 

00:21:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:21:50
SHANNON DERMER And, um, and I think that we can fall into the same trap. Especially when we’re focusing on diagnosing. But especially when we fail to see, um, holism and wellness. 

00:22:05
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER So talk to me a little bit more. I want to actually define wellness. Because it’s different for every person in some ways. But, uh, it is the last -- instead of focusing in on, um, the lack of symptoms. It’s focusing in on optimal. 

00:22:20
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:22:20
SHANNON DERMER Um, like for example, uh, just because you don’t have a sexual dysfunction doesn’t mean that you have a great sex life. 

00:22:25
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER So from a wellness perspective and a holistic perspective, we’d focus in on their sex life, but also their relationship overall, their physical health, their spiritual health. And, um, not just having a lack of a symptom but actually having an enjoyable satisfying, um, sexual relationship. So talk to me a little bit about how you ply some of those ideas to counseling over all. Especially when it comes to the issue of diagnosis. Focusing on wellness and holism. 

00:22:55
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:22:55
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. And I think, you know, that – that’s a perfect example because it relates to, when I was talking about the absence of illness does not equal health. And unfortunately, if we’re only focusing on an illness, and eliminating that illness, it stops at a certain point and people really never learn how to, uh, achieve prevention in the future. Or develop as a human being. Or what is so vital becoming happier and more fulfilled in life. So, I think it comes down to a perspective even at the initial part of the counseling process thinking of clients as people who are suffering and how to help them achieve growth in their own life to move towards happiness. And that’s why I mentioned which something that it sticks with me always when I’m working with clients, also when I’m working with supervisees, also when I’m etching or presenting, how do I help this human being who’s suffering become their own therapist. It’s a guiding principle that will help them understand that a diagnosis is just a part of the process what we’re trying to hone in on what we call their suffering. And transform that into something different and better in their life. 

00:24:25
SHANNON DERMER So how – uh, I’ve always said, our job really is to put ourselves out of a job. 

00:24:25
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yeah. 

00:24:25
SHANNON DERMER You said it better and more memorable of we’re going to teach our clients – or guide our clients in how to become their own therapist or counselor. So what specifically do you focus in on when you’re trying to help a client or a supervisee help their client, um, into becoming their own guide, their own counselor therapist. 

00:24:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Well, in terms of diagnosis, you start by really having a conversation with the client about what they’re suffering is. And how it affects their life. This is very, very, different than what happens most of the time especially in a medical model approach where a client comes in and they’re almost a passive recipient playing 20 questions with you. It’s a rapid fire approach just to getting data so you can decide what to do to them. Very, very different approach from having a conversation with them and being in a learning mode with the client so you could both understand what they’re struggles are and you – you allow that information to be exposed to both of you so you’re learning. It’s a more open learning growth producing process that really models the whole rest of the treatment process. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER Good. So let’s – and I’ll just use this example, um, even though in some ways it’s an extreme example because you mentioned your client, uh, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. That, um – so someone comes in with, um, the diagnosis of schizophrenia. If you’re coming more from the – a true medical model you’re thinking how can I end some of these symptoms. 

00:26:10
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER That are part of that diagnosis. So hallucinations, delusions, you know problems in your thought process, things like that. And so you might be able to give some medications, um, to, uh, end some of those things or at least control them. But just ending those things you’re saying, doesn’t give someone a happier, better, more fulfilling life. That it’s not just ending the symptoms even with something like schizophrenia it’s looking at what they want, who they want to be, what kind of relationships do they want and focusing on that. That that’s wholeness and wellness as well as maybe gaining some control over symptoms. 

00:26:50
Robert C. Schwartz, Ph.D., PCC-S 

00:26:50
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ That’s right. It’s focusing on their life. And it’s also realizing that medications as one example of a medical model treatment, may or may not even reduce or eliminate symptoms. Uh, a huge proportion of what leads to symptom reduction with medications is actually the placebo effect. And what is that come down to, it comes down to someone state of mind. Thinking, believing, excepting that something will change and so your mind changes and then the symptoms reduce or go away. But what ends up happening with that is that the person themselves, the client, doesn’t really understand how that’s working and they’re not therefore invested in the process. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER They’re not owning it. 

00:27:45
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. And a lot of research has shown, believe it or not, 80 percent of what leads to positive client change involves two things, motivation and involvement in the counseling process. 

00:28:05
SHANNON DERMER I – so – I just want to repeat that. Because that was – 80 percent of the – the positive change that happen in a session are related to motivation and getting the client involved in the process. 

00:28:15
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. 

00:28:15
SHANNON DERMER Or owning part of the process. 

00:28:15
ROBERT C. SCHWARTZ Yes. And decades and decades of – of research have shown that related to the common factors of change, a wonderful book called the Heart and Soul of Change. Also research by an – an excellent counselor, educator, Fred Hanna who, um, professor emeritus from Johns Hopkins University, these are striking figures that show if you work with the client they have a sense of necessity in – to engage in the process with you because they believe they can grow and develop towards health the more likely you’ll succeed. 

00:28:55
SHANNON DERMER Great. I think that’s a great point to end off on. Because it’s something we all can work with, the motivation and engagement of our clients. If you’d like to learn more, please visit the Alexander Street Press website. Become engaged with that and, um, thank you, Dr. Schwartz for talking about this important topic with us today.
