MARCUS GENTRY There was a special Olympics competition for skiing. And the skiers had amputations so there was one lady who skied who had an amputation, one leg skier. She was skiing down the slope and she was skiing as fast as she could. And somehow just before she got to the bottom she fell. And, um, the skier behind her came and she was also an amputee and she was concerned oh my, I hope that doesn’t happen to me. And I – I don’t know how this is going to work out. So when it was her turn she got on the slopes and she started skiing down there. She was skiing faster and faster and just before she got to the finish line she fell too. She got up and finished her race just like the other person did. And the friends on the side said to her, oh my, you – you did good. Uh, she was, uh, a much – just a little bit faster than you. She said, it wasn’t that she was a faster skier than I was. She just got up faster than I did. She had the ability to bounce back, to get up quickly. Why is being resilient so important. Because that’s what we’re going to be talking about now. How to bounce back. How to be resilient when something happens. Why is it important that we know a code for being able to bounce back. There’s a few reasons. One reason I would say is because some people feel locked in to relationships. They feel locked in to situations and they don’t know what the key is to get out. Imagine yourself being a room that was constantly closing in. You knew a key was there, but you didn’t know where it was. Some people feel like that in their health situations. They don’t know the key to be able to bounce back. And become resilient when something traumatic happens. Another reason why it’s important that we learn a code for being able to unlock those things is, as a dear friend of mine, Big Bob used to say, we’re all going to experience a suddenly at some point. Where suddenly something is going to happen that we didn’t expect. We’re going to hear something we didn’t expect to hear. We’re going to see something we didn’t expect to see. We’re going to experience something that we never thought was going to happen. And it was going to throw us out of our set of expectations. That’s going to happen suddenly to pretty much everybody who watches this. Even those who don’t watch it. Even it’ll happen suddenly or what’ll happen things will change gradually from being you – younger to getting older and things happening. Talk to some people who are older now, seniors and remembering how things were when they were much younger. That gradual change sometimes creates a restrictive feeling and they don’t know how to bounce back when those things change. So it’s important that we learn a code that will help us to be effective in being able to do that. And that’s what I’m going to give you in this session. I’m going to give you what I call a survival code. And you know what it is, it’s three strategic points. That when you combine these points together, they will be able to help you get the best out of any conceivable situation. What I’d like you to do is as you listening to this, think about your clients. And think about yourself. And think about something that you could pull from these tools that I’m going to give you, out of this three point survival code, that might be able to help you or your clients become a little bit more resilient in bouncing back when something suddenly happens to them or when change comes about that they really may not have been prepared for. Are you ready. The first of the three is what we call, the human factor. That’s survival point one. The human factor. You see in understanding the human factor we understand that there was the cell that initially traveled along with millions of other cells that met the egg, that produced who you were on your day of birth. Inside of that cell millions of others were traveling, but they didn’t survive. They didn’t make it. But the one cell that produced you was able to be resilient. It was able to constantly evolve. It was able to expand. It was able to transform. It was able to remain flexible and be resilient so that it could become the person that you are. So actually, in your DNA is the ability to overcome challenges. To bounce back and to be flexible. You are powerful in that way and if you could remember that, that in and of itself will help you to be resilient in dealing with situations. Now let me tell you why that very knowledge can sometimes create a problem for you. Especially those of you who are effective at working with other people. You see those of you who work with – with so many others, you have done things that other people couldn’t imagine being able to do. You’ve helped them solve problems that they saw no way that they could possibly solve. You helped them find solutions to things. Find their inner strength. You’ve been able to go against obstacles that people said, couldn’t be done. They’ve written books about some of the things you’ve done. In fact, you’ve done it so well that some of you have started to believe that you were the supermen and the superwomen of the world. And you forgot that you were human. Being human means understanding not only our strengths but understanding there are certain things as humans that – that we really can’t do. Allow yourself permission to be you. It’s okay to be you. It’s okay to be and sometimes it’s fine to say it’s just okay. Let me give you four things that I want you think about in terms of the human factor that as humans we just can’t do. But we forget it sometimes. Number one is this, you know that you can’t do everything. In spite of your attempts and in spite of the fact that we put clever words on it, like multitasking and things of that sort. And we’re always trying to do different things. The reality is we – we’re trying to make lists and we have a shopping list and we have a to do list and we have a bucket list and we have all these lists of things. But at the end of life, we’ll never, ever complete all the things on our list. We have to realize that no matter what we just can’t do everything. So we have to maybe start to prioritize things a little bit differently. Because we’ll have a lot of things brought to us and put on our table to try to accomplish. And we can’t really be resilient in bouncing back if we’re weighed down with the belief that we have to do everything that has to be done. Being pulled at us, being brought to us from so many different directions. That was an easy one. You know what the second one is, you can’t please everybody. In spite of your best attempts you can’t please everybody. How does the saying go, you can please all the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time. But you can’t please all the people all the time. Is – isn’t that true. But you have people pulling at you, maybe your – your – your patients or your clients pulling at you. Maybe your siblings pulling at you. Maybe your children. Maybe your spouse, maybe your friends, maybe the extended family. And you’re really trying to go out and please everybody at the same time. And you find it ultimately you’re not pleasing anyone, especially yourself. Give yourself permission to be human. But not only that allow that same permission for those people who you work with. Realize that they can’t please everybody either. They can’t do everything. And sometimes the very thing that we want them to please us in, the very thing that we want them to do for us, they may not be able to do. Simply because they’re human as well. Just like you. Here’s the third one. You cannot fix everything. Now that’s a pretty big one, isn’t it. Because sometimes because you have fixed things in the past and you’ve corrected things and solved things that other people saw no way that it could be done you sometimes think you can fix everything. The truth is that we can’t fix everything. A matter of fact there’s something that’s not even our job to try to fix. I had a hard time trying to explain that to my father. He’s now 93 years old and self made man and raised a family and -- and home and – and did many things on – on his own. But when my mother got sick and had Alzheimer and he was doing all he could. I – I sat and talked with him on a number of occasions and he said, you know what son, no matter what, with all I’m trying to do, at the end of it, I can’t fix your momma. I can’t make her any better. No matter what. I said, it’s okay, dad. You’re human. It’s not even your job to do that. Give yourself permission to be human. It’s okay to be you. Which is human. Also give that same permission to other people. The next piece that you cannot do or we cannot do as humans is this, you can’t add more time to your day. No matter how many efforts we make, no matter where we live, no matter what our bank account looks like, no matter where we have advanced academically, we’re still going to get 1,440 minutes a day. We’re not going to get any more. Matter of fact, you can’t even manage time, did you know that. You can – only can manage the things that you do within the time that’s allotted that you have. Allow yourself to be human realizing that your time is limited. There was a movie that I saw once and in the movie the teacher asked the students what time is it, or how much time do we have left. He said the answer is not on the wall and it’s not on your watch. He said the truth is we don’t know how much time we have left. But you have just enough time to make a difference. And I share with you now in realizing that you’re human and that you can’t control your time or add more time to your day. You’ve got enough time to say thank you. You’ve got enough time to smile. You’ve got enough time to say I’m sorry. You have enough time to do the necessary things to make the change that might be monumental in helping someone else just be able to bounce back. Don’t think that any small efforts are too small. Uh, Edward Lorenz when he wrote about the, um, the Butterfly Effect or the – the Chaos Theory he talked about how one little thing can have major ripple effects. It applies here too. The second factor is this, the balance factor. You know, if we don’t maintain balance, chaos erupts, every time without exception. Uh, externally and internally. We can look at our universe if balance is not maintained with the – the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. If we don’t have balance maintained with the tilt of the universe the distance between the – the sun and the earth the rotation of things within – our plants without our universe. Uh, chaos will erupt. Internally if balance is lost, um, in terms of our blood pressures, in terms of our sugar levels in terms of cholesterol problem erupt. The same thing is true psychologically. If we don’t maintain balance problems will come up. To be resilient we have to be able to maintain our balance. There is something that’s referred to as the Hedonic treadmill. And it’s something that – that suggests that in most people there is a balance set point. This kind of set there for us already. So no matter how bad things get, people tend to come back to that same level of contentment or happiness. So no matter how great things are, people win lotteries, they say at some point they come back to the same basic level of happiness. There is a set point that’s installed in us already. In terms of maintaining our balance. But sometimes we need a little help, don’t we. Sometimes we need to do a little bit more to maintain our balance because something has suddenly happened. We’ve seen, we’ve heard something and our balance is thrown off so there are a few things we can do. One of the things we can do is unplug. Remove, replace distractions. We’re in a time that’s so plugged in we’re – we’re logged in, we’re turned on, we’re – we’re signed in to different kind of facebook, instagram, twitter, uh, all kinds of internet things. With the job, logged in with the job. Connected with our children. That we have so many things that we don’t unplug long enough just to breath. Sometimes we need to just unplug. And replace the distractions with silence. Another thing that we can do to help center ourselves to find our balance because once we find our balance we’re able to bounce back and be resilient and that’s returning to nature. Have you ever walked by a ocean. Been next to a mountain. Walked on a forest trail and – and the scene that you saw was just so awe inspiring that it left you without words. You were just wow, this is something. Yeah. You were connecting with the very force that’s inside of you. the very force that runs the oceans and the trees and the mountains. That same force is inside of you and connecting with nature sometimes allows you to center yourself. So that you can become resilient and bounce back. What if you use that as one of the tools to help you or your clients become resilient. Suggest that. Relaxing and breathing is always critical. Just to be able to take our time and relax, take our time, relax and – and breath and find something that allows us to center ourselves is extremely powerful. But what do you do to relax and breath. As a matter of fact I want to ask you the question, when is the last time that you took say five minutes to do nothing but relax and breath. You were unplugged. You returned to nature possibly. Or even you just sat still and you did absolutely nothing. Sometimes that process of breathing, and breathing deeply allows you to be able to center yourself. And become balanced so that you can become resilient. Another aspect of what you can do in terms of, uh, finding that center and that balance is reflecting on your essence. I touched on that a little bit earlier when we spoke about nature. But reflecting on your essence means remembering who you were first. Remember the power of the DNA and inside of you there is the ability to overcome obstacles. That’s already in you. What if you took a moment or your clients took a moment to reflect on who they were first. What if they took a moment to reflect on the foundation that they have inside of them. From what they’re standing on. You – you see, all of us are standing on the shoulders of giants that came before us. Think of the person who said or did things that laid an example and a foundation for you to be where you were. What if during your still moments you took some time and reflected on that foundation. The people, the persons who made a difference in your life. Recognizing also in your reflection upon your essence you’re also reflecting on that force that’s inside of you. The force that creates major things happening. The force that allows you to survive. That force that allows you to be resilient. Being still and reflecting on those things. The next one is this, remembering your destination. Sometimes to center ourselves we merely need to remember where it is that I’m ultimately going. You can’t if ever watch one of the -- the men or women who are on the tight rope, they – they can’t always quite look down at – at where they are. Sometimes they have to look ahead and where they’re going. And focus that. When you’re learning to ride a motorcycle one of the things they tell you, you know what it is, they say look through the curve. Don’t look down at the curve, look through the curve as you’re turning it. Sometimes you have to focus further on your destination. And that will help you be more effective in gaining your balance to be strong. But guess what the third point is. The third point is this, the choice factor. I describe it this way. When we came into this world as infants, we were all given an all access pass into the amusement park of life. Now we can get on the high rides or we can get on the merry go round or we can sit on the side and eat cotton candy. But the truth is, we have the ability to chose how we want to handle the different things that are available to us. And remembering that we have the power to chose is empowering in and of itself. Because we may feel that we have to deal with things a certain way or things have to be a certain way. But the reality is we can chose a different course of action. If we decide what the consequences might be and what options we have and what resources we may have available we can chose to do something else. But when they become available, are you able to access them. Are you – do you have the audacity to go after the things you want. One thing sometime gets in the way of being able to use our access pass. And I’m going to tell you what that is. You probably already know. It’s the fear factor. Sometimes you can become so afraid that the fear factor keeps you from being able to access the things that’s readily available. Because you know what fear does. It causes you to exaggerate the possibilities. You see things much bigger than they are. So – sometimes much worse than they are. But if we can ease pass that fear factor and realize we have the power to chose, it’ll be very strong. Imagine yourself locked in a room. And you have the keys right in front of you. Maybe for your clients. The key exists in this, remembering the human factor. You’re very powerful and it’s okay to be human. Remember the balance factors, important to maintain your balance, to center yourself. Doing whatever’s necessary to relax and breath, disconnect, unplug. Remember your esters, remember your destination to maintain your balance. And the last one is what, it’s the choice factor. You have the power to chose. I ask you to look for one element of all the things that we have talked about that you can pass on to your clients. But that you can first use yourself in building resiliency. Thank you for listening.

SHANNON DERMER Mr. Gentry. 

00:20:25
MARCUS GENTRY Yes, mam. 

00:20:25
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:25
SHANNON DERMER Thank you for your talk. Um, resilience, it’s something that actually is talked about a lot in counseling and therapy. Um, maybe not overtly with clients. But in the research, that, um, resilience is really important. Because as you said, we’re all going to fall down. 

00:20:40
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:20:40
SHANNON DERMER It’s how quickly and how well we get back up. 

00:20:45
MARCUS GENTRY We get back up. Yes. 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER Yes. Um, I kind of see it like, uh, the immune system too. You’re talking about how to strengthen and prevent and all that. But it’s not that we won’t ever get sick. It’s how well our body deals with that. 

00:20:55
MARCUS GENTRY Bounce back, yes. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. So, um, I know you talked a lot about it in you presentation. But you can give us again, in a nutshell you know, um, how you see the definition of resilience. 

00:21:10
MARCUS GENTRY Resilience – well, as what, resilience actually is? 

00:21:10
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:21:10
Marcus Gentry 

00:21:10
MARCUS GENTRY Is what you’re – it’s the ability to bounce back. Especially when the unexpected happens. Uh, our ability to bounce back. Um, I think that’s extremely critical and, uh, again, I believe that there are certain codes, certain philosophies or concepts that we can, uh, adapt. Ann Rand, um, wrote a book, she was a philosopher and a playwright. And one of the books that she wrote was called, Atlas Shrug and in there one of the things she said was that when you could determine the dominant philosophy of a society you’ll be able to predict its outcome. She said the same is true with an individual. So in terms of me addressing the matter of resiliency I’m talking about developing a concept. A mindset, a philosophy for life. Um, that allows you to be more effective in handling, uh, challenges or – or different things when they come up. Because they – it’s going to happen at some point. So especially for clinicians, who are in the field and, uh – you know, I talk with military, um, individuals as well. But especially in that field where you have already overcome multiple challenges, for other people and showed them how to do it. We forget that we can’t fix everything. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:22:25
MARCUS GENTRY We forget that we can’t please everybody. And we – that’s why the burnout rate is so high in the fields of caring for others and more often than not, the caretakers are the last ones to be cared for. 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER So your ideas of resiliency are for – for clients and the public. But also for the helpers, the clinicians. 

00:22:40
MARCUS GENTRY Absolutely. Absolutely. Because our burnout rate is so high. Maintaining balance. Sometimes when you enjoy what you do so much, you forget to take the time to do other things that’s relaxing, that’s non-work related. Just completely different, so that you can maintain your balance. That the balance has an – an amazing way of – of handling that. It’ll keep things functioning so long out of balance, until all the sudden there’s a crash. But ultimately whenever things remain out of balance for period of time, uh, chaos always erupts. So it’s important to, uh, think about maintaining your balance versus being the best. Um, I – I find that some are more – especially in society with median things. You want to have the best. You want to live in the best place. You want to be the best that you can be. And – and sometimes – in attempts at being the best we lose balance. And you – you simply have to turn on the television to see examples of people who have acquired the best in terms of, uh, properties and – and homes and incomes. But they lost their balance in terms of relationships and – and mental well being. 

00:23:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER  Yeah. When I listen to you speak I think of you as having a very holistic approach. It’s not just about this problem or this moment. But it’s about a general attitude and taking care of yourself in general. Every time you say balance I think of -- 

00:24:05
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER -- a holistic. And, um, it’s interesting you were talking about the best. It reminded me of something my grandfather used to say. He was a very successful man. He was very intelligent. 

00:24:15
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER Um, he was a biochemist. And he had his own chemical company. And he said that he would rather hire someone who was more well rounded, who had the three point five GPA but had relationships, were involved with outside, you know, activities and all that, then the person who only focused getting the four point oh. And didn’t have balance in their life. Because I think he believed too that eventually that’s going to erupt in chaos. You can’t maintain that forever. 

00:24:45
Marcus Gentry 

00:24:45
MARCUS GENTRY That – that’s exactly right. As a matter of fact, when I speak at school systems, one of the things I talk about is what true education is. And that’s being able to feed and clothe and shelter yourself. Um, and knowing how to do that and have well rounded healthy relationships in your life. Whatever that -- and being healthy yourself. And – and those are critical, critical, pieces – as opposed to, as I mentioned early getting caught up in this Hedonic treadmill where you constantly having to buy something new or get something different. And find that the satisfaction is only temporary. And you’re constantly doing that. Or even academically just – I – I’ve worked with many students and they’re, uh, only concern was getting a high GPA. And they really hadn’t concerned themselves with what they had learned. Or how they were better able to feed, clothe or shelter themselves. 

00:25:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:25:30
SHANNON DERMER Yes. Yeah, so you’re – you’re talking about bouncing back. Um, isn’t just – like I said for that moment it’s also what you were talking about, like a world philosophy, a personal philosophy, a way of – of seeing things. And then it’s – it was also it sounded like a little bit about forgiveness or grace for oneself and for one – or for others when you can’t do things perfectly. 

00:25:55
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. Giving yourself permission to – to not be without flaw. Give yourself -- 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER Except for me. I’m without flaw. Just kidding. 

00:26:10
MARCUS GENTRY Giving yourself permission and then giving other people permission as well. So that you can, uh – if you can’t resolve a situation, uh, be human enough to release it and let it go, release the need to try to control it. It’s okay. Uh, that person has an all access pass into the amusement park of life. The same as you do. 

00:26:30
SHANNON DERMER I like that, all access pass. Uh, you said a little bit, um – are you familiar with the idea of mindfulness. 

00:26:35
MARCUS GENTRY Being mindful, yes. 

00:26:35
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:26:35
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:26:35
SHANNON DERMER  Because a lot of what you talk about taking time to, like relax, reconnect with yourself with your brain power. 

00:26:45
MARCUS GENTRY Absolutely. 

00:26:45
SHANNON DERMER With others. Um, but, also the idea that, um, stuff happens. And that we have to deal with it. And it’s our putting that onto ourselves or not being able to forgive ourselves that causes, um, pain happens. But as another speaker said, suffering is something we create for ourselves because we can’t forgive ourselves or forgive others. 

00:27:05
Marcus Gentry 

00:27:05
MARCUS GENTRY Right. Forgive others and again, giving others permission. And in this society of technological growth, um, we are able to communicate with people in other countries. Um, and – and around the world, constantly in an instant. But we have difficulty communicating with each other that’s very close by us. So, we – we haven’t been focused on relaxing and taking the time to get to know even who we are. Was it the speaks about the unexamined life is not even worth living. So it takes more effort now than it did because we have more distractions that’s pulling at us constantly from our – from our Iphones, to our Ipads, to, uh, technology, the computer. So many things – games. So many things pulling us. We have to work diligently just to be able to get that time for ourselves. But it has to be of high value. We have to value the importance of it. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER Good. We only a couple minutes left. But I do want to, um – I said I was without flaw. But I am. And I pointed out you’ve been correcting me, gently, and nicely. I keep saying something about forgiveness. And you keep saying no, permission. 

00:28:15
MARCUS GENTRY Yeah. 

00:28:15
SHANNON DERMER Permission to not be perfect. And – and I think there is a good distinction there that forgiveness implies that there’s something to forgive or permission is the idea -- 

00:28:25
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER -- that this is part of all of us. There’s no reason to forgive it. 

00:28:25
MARCUS GENTRY Exactly. It’s – it’s a part of what I call one of the 10 dominant principles of respect. And that’s respecting yourself, respecting others. And respecting the environment. That a person has the same gifts innately and abilities that you – they may vary a little differently. But – but they are unique individual that deserves to be respected. Including the right to make their own decisions. Even if we don’t agree with them. 

00:28:55
SHANNON DERMER Exactly. Now I have to respect our time. I’m short on it. 

00:28:55
MARCUS GENTRY Okay. 

00:28:55
SHANNON DERMER So let me wrap up. I want to thank all of you for joining us. I want to thank Mr. Gentry for all of his ideas. Please check out the Alexander Street Press site for more from Mr. Gentry and other therapy talks. Thank you. And thank you. 

00:29:10
MARCUS GENTRY Thank you very much.
