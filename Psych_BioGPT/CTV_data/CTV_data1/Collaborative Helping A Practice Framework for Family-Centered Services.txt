Microtraining Associates Presents Collaborative Helping A Practice Framework for Family-Centered Services with William Madsen, Ph.D. 

00:00:35
WILLIAM MADSEN Hi. I'm Bill Madsen and I'm here to talk to you today about collaborative helping. Collaborative helping is a practice framework for family-centered services. We'll review this approach, ah, give you an overview of it and also provide concrete examples from, uhm, from practice. 

00:00:50
Family-Centered Services •A wide range of services for helping families •Culturally responsive, strengths-based, collaborative, empowering •Wraparound, systems of care, family conferencing, signs of safety 

00:00:55
WILLIAM MADSEN Family-Centered Services is a broad approach to helping in human services. Uhm, it, ah, begins with a wider range of individualized services and it's an attempt to fit services to families rather than family services. Uhm, it often has flexible funding streams, uhm, in order to make services as individualized and relevant as possible for families. While the meaning different definitions of family-centered services, the one thing to all have in common are shared said of commitments and principles. Things like, ah, commitment to cultural responsiveness, to being strength-based, to working in collaborative partnerships, uhm, to having an empowerment focus and being family driven or making our accountable to the people that we serve. Examples of family-centered services would be in behavioral healthcare, ah, things like wraparound and systems of care, uhm, in child protective services examples would be things like, family good conferencing and the signs of safety approach to child protective services. 

00:02:00
Collaborative Helping •Appreciative Inquiry •Motivational Interviewing, •Narrative, Solution-focused, and Collaborative Therapy Approaches •"Signs of Safety" work in CPS •The reported experience of families 

00:02:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Collaborative helping is an integrated practice framework for family-centered services. It draws from a number of different areas. Ah, in particular draws from appreciative inquiry, motivational interviewing, narrative, solution-focused, and collaborative therapy approaches, the signs of safety approach to child protective services and perhaps, most importantly the reported experiences of many families. Uhm, al-- a lot of this work, ah, the-- in order to keep this work really grounded in, uhm, in the field, a lot of, ah, the development of this work has come from going out and doing interviews with both helpers and family members and asking them, you know, what for you is at the heart of good helping? And, uhm, and they have been my best teachers. So let me begin by high-- adding three foundational elements to, ah, collaborative helping. Ah, the first is that, it begins with an appreciation of the importance of relational connection. Uhm, I think at hard of this work is the attitude or relational stance that we hold with families, the same more about that as we call along. A second foundational element is it draws on a story metaphor. It's organized by a story metaphor which holds an appreciation of the power of stories in our lives. Uhm, and a third foundational element is the use of inquiry or, ah, asking compelling questions. I wanna emphasize that one of the powerful things that we can bring to this work is asking questions. 

00:03:45
4 Guiding Commitments • Cultural Curiosity • Possibility of Change • Partnership with families • Empowering processes 

00:03:45
WILLIAM MADSEN We wanna have like four guiding commitments. Uhm, first is, striving for cultural curiosity and honoring family and community wisdom. I think we can think about, ah, the process of helping as a cross-cultural negotiation. We can think about families as a particular culture and the helping system as a particular culture. Within mind then we can think about services as a cross-cultural negotiation. We can think about entering families, uhm, more as an anthropologist seeking to elicit their meaning than as professional seeking to, uhm, ascribe our meaning to what's going on in their lives. Ah, second guiding commitment would be, ah, believing in the possibility of change in building on family and community resourcefulness. Any time we go out and meet with the family, what we look for shapes what we will see. And we could begin by focusing on what is and could be rather than simply focusing on what isn't and should be. A third commitment is a commitment to working in partnership with families and feeding services to families rather than families to services. If we, uhm, when which I have talked about that in the past is to referred to it is doing-- helping people on family turf rather than people unprofessional turf. Our final commitment is, uhm, engaging an empowering processes and making a work accountable to the people that we serve. I think we can describe empowering processes as a way of referring to ways of thinking and acting that acknowledge support and amplify people's participation and influence in developing the lives that they prefer. Similarly, we can think about these empowering processes as referring to ways of thinking and acting that inadvertently disqualify, constrain or suppliant people's participation and influence in their lives. Despite our intentions, health perceptions may have empowering effects, disempowering effects or mixed effects. One way to avoid inadvertent disempowerment is to make our work accountable to the people that we serve and to actively solicit their feedback about the effects of our actions on them. In this way we can become accountable allies working with families. 

00:06:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay, let me see a few things about stories, experience in family help or interactions. I wanna try to make three points here. The first is that, the stories of our lives don't just represent our lives. They shape our lives. Stories promote selective attention to certain things, selective at-- an attention to other things. Ah, in the words of Michael White, stories prone from experience those things that don't fit within them. And so in that way, they help to not just represent our lives but actually shape our lives. Ah, a second point that I'd like to make about stories is that, the stories of our lives occur within a broader cultural context and within broader, uhm, cultural narratives. So they are not simply our stories. Uhm, but our, our broader stories. Ah, an example of this would be a mother I work with. Uhm, who, ah, whose daughter was really struggling in her life. And she was very upset, both that her daughter was struggling but also thought she was a really bad mother because her daughter was struggling. Now, this idea that if her daughter struggling it mean she's a bad mother. It's not just simply this mother's idea. It's an idea that has a whole lot of, ah, cultural value. Uhm, and for this woman to discover, you know, I'd ask her question, do, do you know other mothers who get caught by this, this idea that if their daughter struggling, they're a bad mom? And for her to begin to-- you know, first response was, "No." Well, Suzie(ph), actually, Marie. Actually, you know, a lot of mothers who-- this is not just my problem. And for her that was profoundly empowering. So that's the second point, that the stories of our lives occur within a broader cultural context. Final point is that interactions between helpers and families have the potential to enact to playout certain stories. The stories of our lives are not just stories that we tell or hold, we live them out in daily interactions. Ah, in that way, every interaction between a helper and a family is holds the potential to, ah, is, is an intervention. Holds the potential to invite the enactment of particular stories. 

00:08:30
Collaborative Helping and Inquiry Collaborative Helping as Joint Exploration 

00:08:30
WILLIAM MADSEN So collaborative helping is a practice framework that is grounded in inquiry. Let me see a little bit what I mean by that. Uhm, I think questions are a very useful device that something that we can, uhm, draw on in our work, ah, to be very helpful to people. And I try to organize a lot of my work around e-- inquiry rather than directional. Ah, I'm using collaborative inquiry to refer to a process of joint exploration. This is not simply a process of helpers asking questions and family members being responsible for answering the questions but rather, ah, sort of a, a process of going on a journey with someone together. Uhm, I'll often say to people-- you know, it's up to me to ask some really good questions and together we'll, we'll try to puzzle this out. Uhm, the process of joint inquiry in this way, uhm, is not a process of going out and discovering pre-existing knowledge, uhm, muting and then pulling and out of people so to speak but rather co-constructing it, jointly developing it in the conversation. 

00:09:45
Good Questions Generate Experience 

00:09:45
WILLIAM MADSEN One of the usefulnesses of questions is that, good questions often generate experience. When we asked people a question, as they go through a mental search for the answer, uhm, they begin to have some kind of experience of themselves. So for example a mother describes just having a horrible time, she is really struggling, she's just about to give up and I say to her, "Well, how is that you've hang in there all these years?" And maybe would go through her head is, I haven't hang in there all these years. When-- what do you mean? Well, actually maybe I did. I have hang in there. Huh? That's interesting. I don't know if I hang in there. I guess, I guess it's, ah, my love from my, my son. And, huh? Maybe I'm not as bad to mom as I thought. Then all of that maybe and then what we hear from her is, I don't know. But the answer is sort of gravy that the real action is in the experience that got generated in the search for answering. So if we can ask questions that are compelling enough, they will generate a certain kind of experience and that can be profoundly therapeutic and it's all right. So in that way, our questions invite the telling of a story, invite the experience of a story. In doing this, this is none an attempt to help people move from a old bad story to a new good story but rather to move from a underdeveloped story to a thicker, richer, more comprehensive story. If, if we were drawn a soup metaphor we could think about this is moving from consummate stories to stew stories. So in that lighten we can think about our skill is helpers as asking questions that elicit, elaborate, and acknowledge ability, skills and wisdom demand and previously obscured for folks. 

00:11:45
Orienting vs Influencing Questions Orienting = Orient the helper Influencing = Change thinking of others 

00:11:50
WILLIAM MADSEN In thinking about inquiry we can draw some distinctions between the kinds of questions that we ask. Uhm, Karl Tomm whose done an amazing amount of work on inquiry and the use of questions has drawn a distinction between orienting questions and influencing questions. Orienting questions are questions, uhm, to-- that help to orient the helper to the people that they're working with. So orienting questions are questions that are design to inform the helper. Influencing questions are questions that are design to influence, have an influence on the people who are being asked. Ah, my, my colleague Sally and Ralph(ph) refers to these as questions in the service of the asked is their questions for the person who is being asked those questions. Karl Tomm was also drawn distinction between two different kinds of influencing questions. The first one is corrective questions, the second one is facilitative questions. Questions with a corrective intent often are questions that hold embedded suggestions. So it often as a situation which a helpers beginning with some ideas about how thing should be, what needs to happen and then poses questions that are in effort to try to get somebody to see something. On the other hand questions with a facilitative intent are questions that don't have a particular direction in mind. That's not an attempt to bring people from here to there but rather questions that open a possibility. Although, there's not a particular direction in mind, there is an effort to open up space that will allow people to reflect under current actions, or current dilemmas, or current situations. Uhm, and maybe take up some different, uhm, opportunities for action. 

00:13:45
WILLIAM MADSEN So let me see a little bit about decision-making in family-centered services. Uhm, you first make a claim that community-based work with multi-stressed family is inherently messy. Despite attempts to come up with protocols or policies that might guide our work human services, human service workers live in the grain. Uhm, this work, ah, for people who do home based work, the one thing that is absolutely predictable on home-based work is that, when you go and knock in the door, you have no idea what's gonna happen when the door opens or if that will open. Uhm, so Nigel Parton has suggested that efforts to try to bring order uncertainty to work characterized by unpredictability runs the risk of missing the point. And he suggested that we need to rediscover our traditional strengths of working with ambiguity, uncertainty and unpredictability. 

00:14:50
Disciplined Improvisation 

00:14:50
WILLIAM MADSEN One of the ways in which I have tried to make sense of this is through the use of the phrase, disciplined improvisation. Uhm, probably the best way for me to explain this would be to, ah, tell a brief story about a mother why I used to me with. So this is a mother who came in who was seeking help in working with her son whose struggling that impulsivity. And after we had met a couple of times, ah, she said to me, you know, Bill when I first came inhere I thought what would happen is I would tell you what was going on with my son and you would give me lines to use with him. But I realize what's happened is my son's impulsivity is much more clever than I will ever be. I will never be able to memorize all the possible lines that I would need to use with him. And I feel like what's happened in the course of our work is that instead of helping me to memorize lines, instead of giving me lines, you've help me to develop a role or character or place to stand. And when I'm in character with my son, life with my son is sort of like impro-- and I, I don't mean, improv comedy. Uhm, but when I'm in role, when I'm in character, uhm, I can do just fine. And I wanna thank you for helping me to develop a role with my son rather than giving me lines to use with my son. Similarly, I think disciplined improvisation, ah, collaborative helping is an attempt to offer a principle based practice framework, ah, for-- to help workers ground themselves in the inherent messiness of this work to give them a solid place to stand in that work. 

00:16:45
Now, Bill meets with Frank and Amour (father and son) Frank and Amour must attend counseling due to a heated argument they had with each other at Amour's school Frank's wife, Amour's mother, recently passed away after a long illness. Usually an excellent student, Amour has become more aggressive and argumentative both at school and at home. 

00:17:10

00:19:55
FRANK You know, he didn't talk back to and, ah, he spent time with her, you know. Some these kids are on these video games in the iPads and electronic stuff and, and-- yeah, he did all. He plays that too but -

00:20:10
FRANK - he, he-- they were friends. They were good friends. 

00:20:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Huh. And Amour do you, do you recognize yourself in this description of you that your dad's been given me? 

00:20:25
AMOUR Yes. 

00:20:25
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. And if I was sitting here with some of your friends and I was to ask them the same question. You know, if I had known this guy for long time, what matter particularly respect and appreciate about him? What do you think some of your friends would say? 

00:20:40
AMOUR Ah, uhm, probably like I-- like me, you know, stuff like that and I'm really know I really like miss my mother and I really did care about her. 

00:20:50
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. Okay. So I know that there are number of concerns that bring you here and I don't wanna close over there. But I wanna ask you something first. Uhm, how do you raise such a good boy? Don't you do that? 

00:21:10
FRANK I don't know, just, ah, best we could, you know? Uhm, like son, you know, I work a lot, you know, trying to make the money so you can go to this kind of schools. Uhm, I always able to-- I wasn't always able to be, be there as much as I probably should have but, but his mom was. And, ah, and we both gave him good values and, ah, taught him respect like I said before. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM MADSEN And as you think about this family that you have here, what, what else you particularly proud about this family that you've built? 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
FRANK I think, ah, I think they can be a big name in the future. People are gonna know him. 

00:22:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. 

00:22:00
FRANK Yes. 

00:22:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Wha-- what would you hope that he's known for? 

00:22:05
FRANK Whatever he want. 

00:22:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:22:05
FRANK That's important. That, that will be good for the world. 

00:22:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. 

00:22:15
FRANK The people will respect him. Respect is important. You know, I have respect and, you know, I have anything at any age. 

00:22:25
WILLIAM MADSEN What do you think about that what your dad saying here? 

00:22:30
AMOUR That respect means everything especially to your mother or your parents and that's anyone actually cuz respect is happen to say, you don't wanna be treated without your respect cuz you treat them. 

00:22:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. So let me start to ask you a little bit about how you guys come to be here today. And I wanna do it in kind of a slightly different way. So you know, we had set up this meeting, it's enough to me for mainly with you guys and ask you some questions and see whether there so much which I may that will be helpful to you and, and probably more importantly if you guys have an opportunity to check me out and see whether it feels like there's a good fit hearing at. So I'm gonna get way ahead of myself here. Let's assume for a moment instead of this being the first meeting that we are having. This is now actually the last meeting we were happen-- having. We got-- we've done better work together, got to end of it and you guys have both feeling like, I'm really glad we did this. This was a good thing. What would be different in your life together? 

00:23:35
FRANK Ah. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:45
FRANK We would have communicated better. Uhm, we would have more patience with each other. And remember we're there for each other. Although you mom, mom is gone she's still there and can't let that go. We can't let that die, can't do anything to obstruct her dreams for you. You know, how important they were. 

00:24:25
WILLIAM MADSEN What would you add to that? We were-- this was our last meeting. You guys were done with me. And you're feeling like, you know, we're sitting around, congratulating each other on, on all the great work that you guys have done. What, what would be different in your life? 

00:24:40
AMOUR Well, like he said, which gonna communicate with each other more, - 

00:24:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. 

00:24:45
AMOUR - have more time together, go to the beach, have fun time together. 

00:24:50
WILLIAM MADSEN You would like to have more fun time with your dad? 

00:24:55
AMOUR Yes. 

00:24:55
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. What, what would make that particularly important to you? 

00:25:00
AMOUR That I know that he knows that he can-- I can be-- he can be a more father for me, that he could care for me and then he can-- mom always remem-- my mother, stuff that me, my mother do. Uhm, ah, we could be the same thing we will working. 

00:25:20
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. And, uhm, your mom someone who's been more important to you? 

00:25:30
AMOUR Yes. 

00:25:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Than to your dad? Okay. From the way you guys have each talked about her, it sounds like she is still very much a presence in your life together. Is that true? What do you like about having her as a presence in your life? 

00:25:50
AMOUR It's like God come and down from heaven again. Seeing her from beautiful eyes, the way she smiles at me. She was beautiful. 

00:26:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. Okay. Uhm, I'll ask you some more about that in a moment. But I wanna-- ah, both of you have said one of the things that you would like would be to communicate better. If, if you guys were communicating better what would that look like? How would you know if you were communicating better? 

00:26:20
FRANK We wouldn't be fighting. 

00:26:25
WILLIAM MADSEN What would you be doing instead? 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:40
FRANK What do you think? 

00:26:45
AMOUR He would be better. 

00:26:50
WILLIAM MADSEN In terms of how? Like what would, what would be better? 

00:26:55
AMOUR Like, talking to each other everyday, not fighting over or something. 

00:27:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. So I wanna ask you-- we could go on a couple of directions here. Uhm, you have said one in your hopes for you guys would be to communicate better, have more patience with each other. Uhm, and, and to kinda live into some of the hopes that your mom have feel, uhm, and then you shared with her for your son. And I wanna ask you some about both what supports that, what helps to make that happen and what are some of the things that get in the way of that. Give sense of where would be better for us to start. Better to start with sort of potholes on the road to this future or to start with the supports. 

00:27:50
FRANK Yeah. That would be the problem. 

00:27:50
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. What are some things that can pull you guys away from the kind of way in which we'd like to communicate with each other? 

00:28:05
FRANK Ah, sometimes we don't listen to each other. We hear but we don't listen. As-- I'll admit, I can be just as stubborn as he is. 

00:28:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:28:15
FRANK If I don't agree with something. And, ah, if I feel strongly-- strong opinion about something then I can be pit-bull headed as he can be. And, ah, I just want you to know that we, we don't fight like what happened. That doesn't happen all the time. All right? Just letting you know then. 

00:28:40
WILLIAM MADSEN I appreciate that that's... 

00:28:40
FRANK That's not-- that I beat my son and he doesn't, you know, fight with me all that, so. 

00:28:50
WILLIAM MADSEN So would you agree with your dad that he's pretty stubborn? 

00:29:00
AMOUR Yes. 

00:29:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Yes. Would you agree with your dad that you're also pretty stubborn? 

00:29:05
AMOUR Yes. 

00:29:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. So let me ask you this a little bit about that. This stubbornness, when stubbornness is around in your life when it's present, when it's in the middle of your relationship. What's that look like? What happens? How do you notice it when stubbornness is there? 

00:29:25
FRANK Just feels like, we're just going round and round a subject, you know? And we talk and add each other. 

00:29:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:29:35
FRANK And, ah, all we're doing is trying to get out on point across and we're not understanding the other. 

00:29:40
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. And when you guys are going round and round, what's the impact of that on the two of you? Or actually, what's the impact for that on you? 

00:29:55
FRANK Well, frustrating, you know? I mean, I mean, I grew up you-- again, don't have a respect in your dad, you know. You know, the first thing you will talk back to your dad. That it, you know, he's-- it's terrible within it like that but it's just, you listened and you obeyed, you know. And, ah, I mean you follow that supposed to know best, right? Uhm, then that's now is the case, and sometime that you will realize there, you know, but, uhm, doing the best they can. Uhm, right, you know, it's just you never get result because we're just butting heads, butting heads and butting heads... 

00:30:40
WILLIAM MADSEN So this round and round thing get you guys butting heads. What's the toll that takes on Amour do you think? 

00:30:50
FRANK I can see, uhm, the-- his studies I guess. After snap as it could be cuz he doesn't want to cuz he's frustrated himself - 

00:31:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:31:00
AMOUR - and, you know, sometimes he just won't do his homework cuz he just pest by the knife fridge(ph), you know, pested me. 

00:31:15
WILLIAM MADSEN And this round and round thing, what's the toll that takes on the two of you in your relationship? 

00:31:25
FRANK Again, I mean, we just-- we don't hear what the other is saying and so we started drifting apart. You know, there, there are times where we'll go, you know, days and not talk to each other. 

00:31:40
WILLIAM MADSEN Hmm. 

00:31:40
FRANK Because we're so, we're so adamant about what we're feeling and the other one apologize. And so, fine. You know, dig our heels in and I gonna budge. And because I'm gone a lot too, that's easier for me to do that, you know, cuz there is physical distance as much emotional, you know? 

00:32:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. And when you find each other with your heels dug in, uhm, I'm guessing that could get to kind of a lonely place for each of you, is that true? 

00:32:15
FRANK Definitely. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM MADSEN When you find yourself caught up in this go round and round thing, right, and when your dad's digging in his heels and your digging in your heels-- uhm, this kind of a silly question but that's the only way can get to the next question when I ask you. Do you like that? 

00:32:40
AMOUR No, not really. 

00:32:45
WILLIAM MADSEN What is it you don't like about that? 

00:32:45
AMOUR Is that guy, I mean, like to hear him yell or shout. For me, shout at him and then only doesn't like grant, way I mean, and then gets home mad and then he starts claim at me like-- just like not a good way to communicate. 

00:33:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Previously I spoke about the importance of relational connection and I wanna say just a couple of other things about that. Uhm, while I think relational connection or holding relational stance of what I have described as unappreciative ally in which people experience such as on their side, in their corner to use more political language standing in solidarity with them against problems in their lives. Uhm, and I have described this as conducting our work in a spirit of respect connection, curiosity and hope. I wanna be sure that I'm not, uhm, wha-- I'm not suggesting that this is just-- that I'm just saying, so be respectful. That's it, nothing else matters. Just be nice and respectful. Uhm, if we think about relational stance as being at the heart of our work, I don't think we could think about this as three concentric circles that there in the middle at harder the work, the nucleus of the work so to speak is relational stance how we are with people. We could move out a ring and focusing on conceptual maps or conceptual models how we think about people and problems. And then we can move out to a further ring out, out on ring of helping practices or what we do with people. Uhm, there are a gazillion different models of therapy and family therapy. And, uhm, I think one of the ways in which we can think about how we choose what models we wanna draw on is that we can evaluate them and evaluate our models, our helping models how we think, and our helping practices what we do by the kinds of ways that positioned as relationally with the people that we are attempting to serve. And I think we could draw on models that are gonna invite, uhm, respect, connection, curiosity, hope. We could also probably draw on models that might invite, uhm, disrespect, disdain judgment and, uhm, I'm a very strong preference for the, for the former. 

00:35:15
WILLIAM MADSEN So, uhm, let me introduce the collaborative helping map here. Let me say a little bit about maps to set the stage for this and then I'll move more directly into the collaborative helping map. Uhm, my son and I, ah, go backpacking every year. We go up into the mountains, head off into the wilderness and go cross country. We get off the trail, get far away from any sort of trail. Now, wandering around in the wilderness off the trail can be a dangerous thing to do if you get, uhm, hurt, no ones gonna find you. If you get lost, no ones gonna find you. Uhm, and so the way in which what we do to keep ourselves safe is we pore over topographical maps. So even though we're in the middle of the wilderness with the map that we have, we have a clear sense of where we are. Periodically will, ah, occasionally as we're walking on come across the trail and, and maybe we see something walking along the trail and it becomes apparent to us that just because you're on the trail doesn't mean you know where you are. So maps I think can be very useful in, in two ways. One is it's the way to organize our thinking and focus our efforts with families. Second maps can also be really useful as a vehicle for conversations with families. The collaborative helping map has been an attempt on my part to really distill down to the simplest map I can come up with. And at present it's down to essentially four questions. Questions would be, where would you like to be headed in your life, what might help you get there, what might get in the way, what needs to happen next? Now clearly, this is not just a process of asking families these four questions, receiving their thoughtful answers, and then watching them run off and live happily ever after. Uhm, I think about this more as areas of inquiry then just four specific questions. And so I'd like to do is speak about a little bit about each of those areas of inquiry. 

00:37:15
Organizing Vision Where would you like to be headed in your life? Obstacles • What gets in the way of that vision? Supports • What contributes to that vision? Plan What needs to happen next? Where do you like to be headed in your life? • Envisioning a non-problematic future • Focusing on preferred coping in a difficult present 

00:37:20
WILLIAM MADSEN Graphically, we can think about the four questions in the collaborative helping map, uhm, as organizing vision, where would you like to be headed in your life? As obstacles, what might get in the way of that? As supports, what might supports you in that? What might contribute to that happening? And as plan, how can we draw on supports, to address obstacles, to get to your organizing vision. Let me start with some, some more about organizing vision. I think we can think about this in terms of asking people about preferred directions in life. Where would you like to be headed in life? And I think with that we can either (inaudible ). Also focus on preferred coping in a difficult present. Sometimes when people are living in a really hard time asking them about preferred futures. Can live them feeling like, I'm sorry but I have to go back to my own planet right now. Uhm, and so no sense that says I think we can move instead and begin to ask people about given the difficulty that is your describing right now. Who's the person you wanna be in responding to them? 

00:38:40
WILLIAM MADSEN So here are some important aspects of an organizing vision. It's important that the visions we help families to develop are clear, are mutually shared, are proactive, and are meaningful and sufficiently concrete. So as an example of this in, in the interview with Frank and Amour, uhm, I was asking them about where they would like to be headed. Uhm, and what they came up with was, ah, better communication and more listening to each other. Now they've both agreed on that. And you notice that that's proactive. Proactive in the sense that it focus on the presence of something rather the absence of something. If they had said, we wanna stop fighting, I might ask them to flip that. And so if you guys weren't fighting, what would that look like? What would be happening instead? So clear, proactive, mutually shared. Uhm, often times I think we can began our work without having a clear vision that's organizing our work and that can be dangerous. Uhm, as Andrew Turner(ph) has said, "It's a long day on a golf course if you don't know where the hole is." Uhm, it's important also that visions be shared by people. Uhm, in-- again in the example with Frank and, and Amour, uhm, they had pretty much of a mutually shared vision. Uhm, if they had instead started with Amour saying, "I won't my father off my back." It might not be a vision that's particularly compelling to the father. But he might, you know, and can maybe ask him a question, would you like to be able to not have to be on your son's back all the time? "Yeah." Okay. And Amour if, if your dad was to get off your back, would you like to be able to trust that he wouldn't jump back on your back? And so that process of developing a mutually shared vision is the foundation for the rest of the work. Now it's also important that we develop, ah, mutually shared visions with people that helpers can signed on you. Uhm, there's a lot of talk about family driven services and more I think that's really important and valuable. It's also important to remember that we also have a voice in the process as helpers. And that's important that we not sign on to visions that we can't live with. 

00:41:00
Questions to Build a Foundation • Why is this vision important to you? • When have you been more able to ground your work in this vision? • Who in your life might support this vision? 

00:41:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Once we've began to, ah, develop the beginnings of a vision with a family, I think there are three questions that we can ask that can be very helpful. Uhm, we can ask questions about motivation. Why is this important to you? We can ask questions about resourcefulness. When have you seen bits of this vision coming true? How have you been making that happen? And we can ask questions about community. Who would stand with you in helping to make this a reality? 

00:41:35
We rejoin Bill, Frank and Amour for remainder of their session... Look for ways in which Bill utilizes... - A Relational Stance - Collaborative Inquiry - An Organizing Vision 

00:41:50
WILLIAM MADSEN And-- so are there times when you guys are able to kinda undig your heels when you can get out from under this round and round thing? 

00:42:05
FRANK Yeah. Yeah. I think from in personally. But I'm not so tired to, you know, when I got-- when I've got a free day or, ah, weekend, a whole weekend and I'm just greed and I get some rest, you know. And that's part probably-- I'm probably bringing some of the job into the home, you know? And... 

00:42:30
WILLIAM MADSEN And, and when you're a bit more rested, how are you different with this guy? 

00:42:35
FRANK I'm a lot more patient and, ah, and I do I hear what he's saying. And I can tend to be a little more agreeable. 

00:42:50
WILLIAM MADSEN And how do you-- what's it like for you when your dad's more patient? 

00:42:55
AMOUR Feel like I just got on jail and freedom. 

00:43:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. And when you are more patient, how does he respond to you? 

00:43:05
FRANK Like the kid I know that I've always known. 

00:43:15
WILLIAM MADSEN What is that look like? 

00:43:15
FRANK Proud. Makes me proud. That I know this is gonna be a good man when he grows up just from the seed that he is now. 

00:43:30
WILLIAM MADSEN So it seems like there are these times where you guys can get caught by this round and round thing, it get you stubborn, it steals away patience, it kinda pushes you apart from each other. And sounds like there are also these times where, uhm, you can listened to him with more patients, he gets to get out of jail free card, you seed more the son you wanna have. What's different about those times when that's happening? 

00:44:00
FRANK It feels more like a family. More like when his mother was alive, we don't have all this when she was alive. You know, I mean, this you know, like the argument here and they were nothing compared. And, ah, and that it feels more normal for us. 

00:44:20
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. And, and how things changed with her passing? 

00:44:25
FRANK Now for me it's a lot of pressure. It's lot more pressure, I mean, I had work before but even harder now and feeling like I don't have that-- I don't have the support system as well, you know, and somebody that I can go to when I'm-- like when I can't handle something. 

00:44:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:44:45
FRANK You know, I can talk to them about anything. And see would make it perfectly all right. I don't have anymore. And I don't have to drop all that on him, you know, he's too young to be dealing all that. 

00:44:55
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. Uhm, your son was talking before about his mother's presence in your life now and how for him she's still a very big presence. Uhm, is that true for you? 

00:45:20
FRANK It's the only thing his be gone. 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:30
WILLIAM MADSEN If she where here listening to you guys talk about your relationship, about your hopes for each other, what would-- what might her response to that be? 

00:45:45
FRANK She a-- like she always think, Frank you can do it, you don't need me to do it. You nee-- you need you to do it. 

00:45:55
WILLIAM MADSEN And would she be surprised seeing you're doing? 

00:46:05
FRANK No. Because she always knew I could. She, she, she never doubted either of our, ah, possibilities. 

00:46:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. How that she come to know that, that you could do this? 

00:46:20
FRANK How what now? How that they could know... 

00:46:20
WILLIAM MADSEN How did, how did your wife come to know this about you? When she's seen in you? 

00:46:30
FRANK Just that the hard work that I've always instilled in him and that I have, ah, shown, and that I have unable to support my family and be there. 

00:46:45
WILLIAM MADSEN So Frank let me ask you about something else, so a, a bit ago you, uhm, talked about this, this idea that you should have the answers, father knows best. Uhm, do you know other fathers whoever get caught by that idea? "Father should know best. Fathers do know best." 

00:47:15
FRANK Where there are other fathers? 

00:47:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. 

00:47:20
FRANK Uhm, I'm sure not only one who has problem with his kid, you know, that can always have the-- know what to say, - 

00:47:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:47:30
FRANK - that's right and then will work. It'll fix things. So sure, I don't think I'm the only one. 

00:47:35
WILLIAM MADSEN And in this idea that father should know best, right? You should have the answers. This should not be struggle. This should not be hard, right? Does-- what's the impact of that idea on you? 

00:48:00
FRANK Well, just feel like I'm failing in something that I used to be pretty good at. That, ah, I guess by this it means I need help. But I'm not good at asking for help. 

00:48:20
WILLIAM MADSEN How do that go with your wife, will she something you can turn to for help? 

00:48:25
FRANK Oh, all the time. Probably, too much. 

00:48:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:48:30
FRANK Yes. 

00:48:35
WILLIAM MADSEN And being in this-- with her rather being in this alone, right? Having someone else that you could count on that within having to know best, having to have the answers, how is that different for you? 

00:48:50
FRANK Much harder. For-- like I said, it's pressure. Uhm, yeah, I mean, it's, it's like you said before it's lonely. And, ah, and I feel like I'm grasping sometimes when I don't have somebody to bounce ideas off of. 

00:49:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. And do you-- uhm, are there ways in which you still turn to her? 

00:49:20
FRANK Oh yeah. I talk to her everyday. 

00:49:20
WILLIAM MADSEN Hmm. What's that like? 

00:49:25
FRANK It's beautiful like he said. You know, uhm... 

00:49:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Did you know that your dad talks to your mom everyday? 

00:49:35
AMOUR No. 

00:49:35
WILLIAM MADSEN Does that make sense to you that he might do that? 

00:49:40
AMOUR Yes. 

00:49:40
WILLIAM MADSEN Do you talk to her? 

00:49:45
AMOUR Sometimes when I feel lonely and sad. 

00:49:50
WILLIAM MADSEN And when you feel lonely and sad and you can talk to her, does that help? 

00:49:55
AMOUR Yes. 

00:49:55
WILLIAM MADSEN So her being in your life together is something that's very helpful to both of you. Uhm, I was asking you before about what she might say if she was here. Uhm, and I was also asking you a little bit about, about, uhm, when she's head up choose to see your love for this guy. What has, what has she thought you about raising him? 

00:50:40
FRANK She always said, just give him a minute and you'll understand where he's coming from. Can't always, ah, push your kid so far and so, you know, again, listening, they all listening. Sometime they don't listen to her. You know, and we would have little spots or whatever but, ah, ah, yeah, that he, I mean, he's not-- sometimes I push too high I guess. 

00:51:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:51:15
FRANK And she seems like, won't you back up and let him find his way. 

00:51:20
WILLIAM MADSEN And her encouragement of you listening, how is that touch to your life? What differences that made for you in your life? 

00:51:30
FRANK Well, ah, I mean, it affects how I communicate with other people too. Even in a, you know, pressure field environment like my job, - 

00:51:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:51:45
FRANK - in carpentry, you know, where you expected to this done now and there's a lot frame that people-- everybody's go on you whatever. And, ah, used to be a little more even killed and it, it helps you in the long run. I mean it's getting all hyper and, ah, and, ah, exiting your ways just-- on the live she was just sitting there and going no place, you know, hitting that wall. 

00:52:15
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:52:15
FRANK And, uhm, whenever I stop and think, you know, I had, I had listened to something she said, or remember something she said that's-- it makes a lot easier to deal with these things. 

00:52:30
WILLIAM MADSEN It sounds like there are some ways much she has made of really big contribution to your life. Give a sense of what you may have contributed to her life, how your presence in her life might have touched her in her life. 

00:52:50
FRANK Ah, well, she knew she was loved beyond, anything. Uhm, and that I, I trusted her completely that she could do anything she want to put her mind to. And, ah, she knew that I was completely behind her and everything. And, ah, and she always caught me a good father even when I wasn't. 

00:53:25
WILLIAM MADSEN Do you have a sense of what she meant by that, what she particularly appreciated but you as a good father. 

00:53:35
FRANK Provider, loving, understanding, would die for him, for her. Nothing more important in my family. 

00:53:50
WILLIAM MADSEN And as you think about the love and the understanding that you bring to, to this guy, uhm, what's, what's your intention in doing that? What are you trying to accomplish in doing that? 

00:54:15
FRANK Preparing so that when he is ready, - 

00:54:20
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:54:25
FRANK - he'll be, he'll be, ah, equip to do the same when he finds somebody long time from now. But, ah, ah, and even before that just in his-- in relationship with other people in general. 

00:54:40
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:54:40
FRANK Again, especially authority figures and elders cuz any-- that, you know, you just-- even if you disagree you've gotta have respect, you know. Ah, I mean, that was drilled into my he-- my head when I was growing up. 

00:55:00
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:55:00
FRANK That you just respect to your elders and those authority figures and those peope that are important. They won't always deserve it but that's the way to go and they'll get you further. 

00:55:15
WILLIAM MADSEN And you have both talked some about relying on your wife, his mother talking to her, uhm, if she where here now hearing that, hearing how she is in many ways living on in your life together, who that be like for her? 

00:55:35
FRANK Oh, a beaming smile to hers and, ah, she knows. She is always known that she is to be apex of this family. 

00:55:55
WILLIAM MADSEN And what's it like for you for us to be sitting here talking about your mom in this way? What does it like? 

00:56:00
AMOUR I feel I know the stuff that we done with her. 

00:56:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:56:05
AMOUR Uhm, that we love her very much and we also miss her. 

00:56:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. Yeah. And, uhm, one thing that I was struck by is, you know, you're talking about how you talk with her, you talk with her. Do you ever talk with her together? 

00:56:30
FRANK No. I can't say that we do. It's maybe, maybe when we were I think in good time or something, you know, she will come up, - 

00:56:35
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:56:35
FRANK - and you know, be part of it. We're going there, get something to eat, you know, you know burger or something like that. But now I notice we don't talk about that. 

00:56:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Then if we go back to, you know, we've talked about stubbornness in this round and round thing that you guys can get caught by, are there ways in which she might be helpful around that? 

00:57:00
FRANK Again, listening. If we listen we'll hear her. 

00:57:05
WILLIAM MADSEN Hmm. In a sense of what might help the two of you in those moments to listen for her, for what her voice might be in that conversation? 

00:57:20
FRANK Over, ah-- as both to stop and shut up first (inaudible ), you know? Ah, cuz she can't here it if you're talking, - 

00:57:25
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:25
FRANK - you know? Uhm... 

00:57:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Did she have any, uhm, I'd-- when, when the way which she said that somehow, ah, suggest to me that there-- that something she might have said to you at some point? Is there like a phrase that, that you can hear from her that might be helpful in that way? 

00:57:45
FRANK Frank, get it together. 

00:57:50
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-hmm. 

00:57:50
FRANK It's a law. 

00:57:55
WILLIAM MADSEN And do you have a sense of what might help you hang on to that to bring them onto your life that, that phrase? 

00:58:10
FRANK Again, just stoppin' and just taking a moment. 

00:58:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. So, you know, we started off, uhm, the school have referred you here because of, ah, scoffed guys are gotten into. Uhm, we haven't talked about that a whole lot. Uhm, it seems to me that what we've been talking about are some things that are actually in which more important or at least seem so to me in terms of your relationship, in terms of patience of listening of the kinda relationship that you guys I'd like to have. Uhm, so, ah, before we ramp up here as, you know, at some-- let's just think back over I was talking today, are there particular things from this conversation that you would like to remember and take away with you when you live here? 

00:59:00
FRANK Yeah, just again that whole idea that listening and then paying at-- well, I guess paying at more attention and like he say, I didn't know that he talked to his mother. Like that, he never told me that. Uhm... 

00:59:20
WILLIAM MADSEN And what's it mean to you to learn that? 

00:59:25
FRANK Well, as a huge connection builder, I think that we are both rely-- still relying on her. Not just soley - 

00:59:40
WILLIAM MADSEN Uh-huh. 

00:59:40
FRANK - but as a family we are relying on her on a daily basis. 

00:59:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah. 

00:59:45
FRANK And, ah... 

00:59:45
WILLIAM MADSEN Yeah, seems very true. 

00:59:50
FRANK You know, a, a family doesn't break up just true death, you know? Uhm, (inaudible ) which is because of death, especially if, if you are-- if that love is still there for that person. 

01:00:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. Anything that you wanna remember about this conver-- this, this talking that we've been doing? 

01:00:20
FRANK And she has to have-- we have to stop the fighting, everything and remember, uhm, my mother very much and I'll be love her so much that we can have something in life. 

01:00:30
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. All right. So it's up to you guys now, uhm, but if, if, if you're up for this, if you would like to do this I'd be glad to meet with you a few times, uhm, to help you guys slow down and listen to each other. And it seems like your mom, your wife would be really important piece of that. So if that holds interest for you, uhm, we can do that. 

01:01:00
FRANK What do you think? 

01:01:05
AMOUR Yeah. 

01:01:05
FRANK See little help. 

01:01:10
WILLIAM MADSEN Okay. Great. Nice to meet you guys. 

01:01:10
AMOUR You too. 

01:01:15
FRANK Thank you. You too. 

01:01:20
[sil.] 

01:01:25
WILLIAM MADSEN So the collaborative helping map encourage us identification of constrains or obstacles at three levels, at an individual level, at a relational level, and at a broader socio-cultural level. Uhm, so for-- in the example with Frank and Amour, at an individual level one of the things they could pull them away from the kinds of ways in which they wanna to communicate with each other was stubbornness. At a relational level they had described that round and round thing where they go round and round it caught in this fights where each of them dig their heels in and get more and more stubborn. When you think about that as an obstacle it pulls them away from the kinda communication that they would rather have. Final at a broader socio-cultural level, Frank had identified this cultural idea of father knows best. Father should know, parents should have the answer. And he talked about how when he wasn't sure, he felt like a failure. So thing-- see how that might lead into frustration, uhm, in-- happen to intransigent, in stubbornness and get in the way of them communicating differently. 

01:02:35
WILLIAM MADSEN As I mentioned before in examining obstacles with families it can be very, very helpful to have conversations about obstacles in ways that are non-blaming and non-shaming. One way to do this draws from the narrative theray idea of externalizing that we can think about people not having or being a problem but rather being in a relationship with a separate problem as a-- a problem as a separate entity in which people are in ongoing and modifiable relationship with it. So for example rather than, uhm, I could say I am depressed, or I have depression. Depression is something I am or I have and it gets conflated with my identity. Ah, I could also say, uhm, the depression is just thing that has come into my life. When it's there makes it hard for me to get up in the morning, makes me grumpy, gets me grumpy with my kids, so distills away my motivation. Uhm, one, one way to do that is to essentially as people are talking and using adjectives to translate adjectives into nouns. So going back to Frank and his son, Frank has said, "I'm stubborn," which is a internal quality. And I said, so how do you notice that when the stubborn that shows up in your life? So that we can begin to think about stubbornness as a problem rather than Frank as a problem. There is a narrative phrase, the person is not the problem, the problem is the problem. I think we can take that even one-step further and think the person is not the problem, the problem may not be the problem. The relationship between the person and problem is the problem. And so that we can think about Frank and Amour being in an ongoing and modifiable relationship with stubbornness. And we can look at the influence of stubbornness on Frank. We can also look at Frank's influence on the life of stubbornness.

WILLIAM MADSEN Uhm, a very simple set of questions that you could ask people would be the-- these are the four broad categories. What's your experience of a problem? Now I would never ask people what's your experience, that's sort of a placeholder question. But, so stubbornness, how do you notice when it shows up? Right? When it's there in your life, what's it like? When it shows up in your relationship, what's it like? Uhm, a facts questions about a facts, what toll has stubbornness taken on your life? What tool has taken on your son's life? What impact does it had on your relationship? We can then ask preference questions which were essentially, do you like that toll? Now that may seem kind of a silly question. Like generally people are not gonna say, "Yeah. I love it. It destroys my life. I'm much better off with it." But it's an important question to asked two reasons. One is that, makes-- it ensures that we don't get out ahead of people, that we're staying alongside of them. And when somebody says, no, I don't really like that problem. Ah, it open up space to ask a follow up question of, well, why is that? What does it you don't like about that? And what does it say about what you do care for and what's important to you? And it, it invites people to take a position in life and to align some emotional energy behind a direction in life. And provides the segue into the last of these four questions, preferred responses. So for asking when-- wha-- what, what do you notice about your experience of stubbornness? What's stubbornness like when it shows up? What toll does it take in your life? Do you like that toll? No. If you don't like that toll we're now making a shift from the influence of the problem and the person to the influence of the person on the problem. So Frank given that, you'd said you don't like what stubbornness does to you, to your son, to your relationship, can you think of a time when we were able to keep stubbornness in its place where you were more the boss that, than it be in the boss of you? How did you do that? What supported you in doing that? Uhm, now we can also do that at a relational level. Uhm, again, in the instance with Frank and his son. Ah, we could externalize that round and round thing to think about that as a dance that they get caught by. Uhm, you notice my language in this as I'm really attributing, uhm, blame and intent in some ways to the problem. Uhm, this is not to hold people, ah, is not to suggest that people not take a responsibility but I think blame and responsibility are such a tight knot in our culture. And while I think responsibility is very important, I haven't particularly seen a whole lot of people change under the weight of blame. I think if we can untie that, if we can begin to suggest that maybe a problem is responsible for the problems that create. But a person is responsible for how they wanna respond to the problem. It actually doesn't take responsibility away from people in fact, uhm, in my experience more often people have, ah, step up the problems. It's like a, a friend of mine who told me, uhm, I'm a procrastinator. He is, not me. Uhm, and, ah, wanna instead of something, I'm gonna do something about that. And I started talking to him about externalizing, the externalizing procrastination. He said, "Oh, thanks a lot Bill." You know? When it was something of who I am, I was kind of stuck with it but now there's just other thing in my life, it's kinda like a kicking a butt. I actually need to do something about this now. So again we could ask, what do you-- how do you notice when, ah, you guys get caught by that interactional pattern, by that round and round thing. What effects does it have on you? What do you think about those effects? Do you like them? Yes or no? Why not? Given that you don't like them, have there been times when you've been able to keep that in its place? Similarly at a so-- socio-cultural level you could do the same thing with this idea of father knows best. I think about that as an idea that is not an idea offered by Frank but one that exists in our culture that takes a toll on many men, right? I'm supposed to know, I don't. I'm a failure. It's probably not a great foundation for parenting. Uhm, and you could begin to externalize that belief. What do you notice it? What does that belief start to suggest you? What toll does it take on you? Uhm, if that belief was running your life, what, what plans would it make feel in your life? Do you like those effects? How there've been times when you've been able to say, maybe father does know best, and maybe I can get some help with somebody else.

Important Aspects of Supports •Eliciting supports at individual, relational and socio-cultural levels •Describing supports in a way that connects people to their intentions and agency Sample Supports with Frank and Amour •Individual level - Love and Concern for each other •Relational level - Virtuous cycle of "Listening and Love" •Relational level - Continued presence of Amour's mother in their life •Socio-Cultural level - not included here Important Aspects of Plan It is important that: •We help families develop a clear, proactive, mutually shared plan that clearly specifies who will do that •We work to identify and engage families' natural communities to support that plan 

01:09:25
WILLIAM MADSEN Uhm, in addition to focusing on obstacles, we can also focus on supports. What are the things that contribute to people moving in the direction they would like to? And again we can identify supports at an individual level, at relational level, at a socio-cultural level. In the example of Frank and his son, uhm, they both talked about their love and their concern for each other. At a relational level they talked about times when he listens and when he listens to his son, he sees a different son. If that round and round thing could be described as virtuous cycle, we could think about this listening and love as a virtuous cycle. Uhm, we can also think about other people, uhm, and how do we begin to develop communities other support. So you, you know, remember throughout that interview I was asking them a lot about, uhm, Amour's mother. And even though she is no longer present in their life, physically present in their life, she is emotionally, spiritually very, very present in her life. Uhm, and, ah, profound piece of support for the two of them. So that then take us into a plan in which we can think about now that we've identified some obstacles, some supports and a vision, we can begin to piece that together and look at how can-- what can we draw on of supports to address obstacles to get to the vision. The plan that I had proposed to them that, uhm, we would begin taking up if we would continue. This was a plan of, uhm, helping them have some-- helping them communicate differently with each other. Ah, doing-- and doing that in a way that really brought, ah, Amour's mother into the conversation as an active part of the conversation. Uhm, and then I think the, the next piece in that would be to begin to look at what are some of the ways in which they're all really doing that, how can they do more of that, who would support them in that, who would stand behind them in that, who would stand with them in that?

Usefulness of CH Maps •CH maps can focus and organize worker's thinking about complex situations •CH maps can serve as a vehicle for constructive conversations between workers and families Re-Thinking "Strengths" •We can re-cast "Strengths" as Supports for an Organizing Vision •This helps us identify strengths that are much more relevant to the work at hand and leads to richer conversations about strengths that are relevant to agreed upon focus Re-Thinking "Needs" •We can re-cast "Needs" as Obstacles to an organizing Vision •This helps us to restrict our identification of "Needs" to those that are relevant to the task at hand and avoid the creation of a long and demoralizing list 

01:11:40
WILLIAM MADSEN So what I've been trying to offer up here is a fairly simple map that can organize our thinking, our work, and our conversations with families. Now this is not rocket signs. These questions are not, uhm, new questions. Ah, ah, there's been a lot of focus on force field analysis and you know, a lot of these questions of what gets in a way, what are obstacles, what supports you? Our questions that have been around for a while. Uhm, I think there are some things that are particularly useful about this particular constellation. Uhm, there's a lot of talk these days about the importance of focusing on needs and strengths where we go out and we, uhm, identify about your strengths that a family has, then we identify needs then we develop a plan to draw on their strengths to address their needs. Uhm, I think strengths are good but I think when we begin by, uhm, focusing it on strengths, ah, I think we can take this a step further. I think if we begin with a vision then we can begin to identify strengths in relation to a vision, right? Often times we end up quoting out strengths like, she's a good hockey player. He's a good cook. So, yeah, nice, but so what? And I think feminist can end up feeling like we're asking them for-- just kind of a silly kinds of questions in, in the strength based discovery. I think if we start with, you know, with-- where, where would you like to be headed? Ah, I wanna have more friends. Well, then in that context her being a hockey player maybe very useful, it has a relevance now. Similarly, needs I think is a very slippery concept. And if we just go in to exploring a litany of needs I think that could become quite demoralizing cuz we're all have a ton of needs. Uhm, and I think it's slippery language like we can fall into saying, you need to stop drinking. Well, maybe. But I'm not sure that's my need to your need. And so I, I found it really useful to instead sort of re-cast needs as obstacles so we can think about where would you like to be headed, what gets in the way, what can we then do about that? My, my hope is that, what this has, uhm, offered up is a framework that is accessible and can be readily used, uhm, number of people who have used that have said, this is pretty simple but it's, it's useful, it's helpful. Uhm, I hope that I've been able to give you some, ah, principles for this as well as some examples of particular kinds of questions, right? I've given you. You've seen the questions with Frank and his son. You've heard me give some other questions. Uhm, I wanna encourage you to also to think about those as, uhm, some guide post or some examples of questions. But more to the point, uhm, to think about questions, ah, that are gonna fit better for you and for-- that are developed in your language, ah, and then, ah, it become questions that you can really come to own. So, thank you.
