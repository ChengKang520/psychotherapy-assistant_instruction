SARAH BANKER When you first come into nursing home, you… you've given up your home and you have give up a great many choices that you had in your life and your daily routines. And also the sense of control that you have over your life and you are very confused and it also leads to lot of depression, but art as I began to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, there're infinite choices in art and the dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

ANNOUNCER Most of the seniors who participate in the program suffer from some form of mental dementia, often the result of stroke, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. The close net groups works hand in hand creating the art work under the guidance of registered art therapist. Afterwards seniors get the chance to review the session. As a result, thinking ability and social skills are strengthened. Therapist and family members often notice an improvement in concentration, problem solving and self dignity. Only about 4% of the 4000 senior day care centers in the country offer any kind of art therapy program at all. And other Intergenerational Art Therapy Programs are nearly unheard of.

00:10:45
DANIEL B. ARON Art therapy is much more than just filling leisure time and having an enjoyable experience. Art therapists are highly trained professionals who combined an expertise in the visual arts with the sophisticated understanding of psychology, psychopathology and psychotherapy. Because of this rich background, they're able to bring the deep pleasures of creativity to those whose world has shrunk with the limitations of age. They're also able to help older adults cope with the inevitable psychological problems, which accompanied the aging process. Especially when illness and disability have taken their toll.
