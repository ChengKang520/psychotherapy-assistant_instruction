BRIEF THERAPY 

00:01:00
INSIDE OUT 

00:01:00
With Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:00
and Diane Jios, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:25
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief therapy clearly identifies a therapeutic focus and goal. And then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategists in the area of brief therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people, with real life problems.

BREAKING PATTERNS OF DEPRESSION HYPNOSIS AND BUILDING RESOURCES 

00:01:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO THERAPIST 

00:02:00
JON CARLSON Hi, I'm Jon Carlson. Welcome to Brief Therapy, Inside Out. 

00:02:05
DIANE JIOS And I'm Diane Jios, this is our guest Michael Yapko, who is going to talk to us about his approach to brief therapy, which is both hypnotic and strategic. Michael, in terms of brief therapy, how, just what is brief therapy anyway. 

00:02:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well there are a lot of brief therapy approaches for me with brief therapy is about, is solving problems, reducing symptoms, building skills, getting people outta treatment as quickly as possible. And so if I were to put a figure on it, I'd say anywhere from one to 12 sessions. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON Well can you describe your approach. Just, how's it work? 

00:02:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well there are many different elements to it, but I think where I begin is wanting to know what the person wants to accomplish, what they want to experience. What kinds of skills their gonna need in order to be able to do the things that they wanna do. 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON So the first is really what they want- 

00:02:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Oh, sure- 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON And then you break it down to what they need to get there? 

00:03:00
Michael D. Yapko. Ph.D. 

00:03:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, I would say that there are four questions, if you will, that guide the work that I do. To be very explicit about it. Question number one would be, what are the goals? What is the person wanting to experience. Uh, and when there are multiple goals, what is a reasonable sequence, or an order of priority for addressing them. Because very often people have multiple things going on at the same time, certainly with depression, there are many co-morbid conditions, for example. The second question which is, in my experience, the one that therapists often have the most difficult time answering. Is, what are the resources that this person is gonna need to have in order to be able to do the things that they wanna do? So it certainly highlights, for me, the value of having been spending the last 20 odd years of my professional life studying people who do things well to get an understanding of what the kinds of resources are typically evident in people who are successful in doing the things that this client in front of me is wanting to learn how to do. Experiencing the kind of things that this person wants to be able to experience. And so, as a part of that question, then, beyond identifying the resources, I want to ask the follow up question does this person already have those resources, and they're just not using them, or am I going to have to start from scratch in building those resources. The third question, then, that guides the work, is how will I build those resources, or teach those resources, what will the exact mechanisms be? How can I create, in other words, a learnable sequence? A linear sequence, for the person evolving kinds of skills that they're gonna wanna have. And then the fourth question is about contextualization. How do I make sure that the person has the ability to use those resources in the context where they would like to have access to them? Which is what I mean by contextualization. 

00:05:00
DIANE JIOS I was struck by this idea of studying how people do things well. Rather than studying pathology. 

00:05:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, certainly I think that we have spent so much time focusing on issues of pathology and trying to generate all kinds of, uh, explanations and philosophies and viewpoints about why people are symptomatic, and I don't really think that teaches us very much. Because each theory is as unprovable as the next in many ways. But certainly when you start looking at people who handle life well, who respond to adversity well, who overcome the daily difficulties as well as the huge difficulties. People who maintain a sense of optimism, even when the circumstances are difficult. People who're good problem solvers. How do they do those things? What are the steps that they follow? What are the things that they think about? Where do they place their focus? What are the things that they tend to tune into, and what are the things that tend to tune out? And when you discover, as I have, that over and over and over again, the kinds of patters that people use to succeed are actually quite repetitive. Quite redundant, in the same way that I would say that people's symptomatic experiences are redundant. I mean, for example, at this point, I don't really need to ask people how they generate airplane phobias anymore. It's redundant. Anybody who sits down in an airplane, straps themself into a seat, and starts visualizing in vivid detail dying in a plane crash, is gonna be phobic. So there-, there's nothing startling about that. But that's the point about human experience, as much as we would like to think that everything that we do is remarkable and everything that we do is creative, in fact a lotta what life is about is sheer redundancy. And so I'm interested in the patterns of the people who handle things well, because that becomes the model or a model, I should say, for the kinds of things I'm gonna wanna teach my clients. 

00:06:55
DIANE JIOS How did you get that work at that point, or what-, what influenced you to go this direction? Where'd you get started? 

00:07:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well there are actually quite a few influences, uh, certainly I was profoundly affected by the work of Milton Erikson (ph), I think that his creativity, his ability to redefine the nature of therapy as a social interaction, has been a very powerful learning. Jay Hayles (ph) work in strategic therapy has also been a very significant influence. I have always admired Aaron Beck's (ph) pragmatism, his common sense approach that instead of evolving esoteric ways of explaining what goes on with people. It's-, it's a very uncommon common sense that-, that Aaron Beck has, and that has been significant. And I think that one of the most profound learnings, one of the most profound teachings for me might surprise people a little bit. But it's Alan Funt (ph) in Candid Camera. Because I don't really think that there has been anybody who has been more skilled at pattern interruption than Alan Funt. So I think that uh, a lot of what I learned there is how much you can manipulate external circumstances to create changes in behavior. 

00:08:15
DIANE JIOS Now, Jon, there's an idea for a new class. 

00:08:15
JON CARLSON That is right, yes- 

00:08:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Candid Camera therapy. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON Sou-, it sounds as you ta-, as ever since you've talked Michael that the heart and soul of your approach seems to be more of a positive solution-focused approach? 

00:08:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I would say so. You know, one of the people that I didn't mention yet that's also been significant was Virginia Satir (ph). And she often has said that if you want your garden to grow you've gotta plant the flowers where the soil is fertile. Now that was her metaphor Erikson would also always talk about focusing on the positive, focusing on what people can do. But the fact that we can either view people as pathological or as resourceful but not yet knowing how to focus those resources, I think leads down two very different paths. And I would certainly much prefer to focus on people's strengths and the kinds of things they can learn and can accomplish and that's where I tend to focus. 

00:09:20
JON CARLSON So how do you see change taking place? In just kind of in a overview of the change process. 

00:09:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I think that people are generally doing the best that they know how to. And if you want them to be able to do something different, then the task really is one of how do you help them achieve that? How do you help empower people to be more skilled, more independent, more in charge of their own lives? And so, for me the process of change is helping people evolve new choices. Whether it's new ways of thinking about experience, reframing, cognitive restructuring, whatever language you wanna put on it. But teaching people to think different about their own experience. Helping people discover alternative ways of approaching the kinds of situations that have been problematic for them. So I think that in a nutshell, that when you provide people with more choices, and you make those choices readily available to people, and practical for people, easily accessible to people, my experience has been that they'll use those choices for their own betterment. 

00:10:25
DIANE JIOS Part of that, it seems to me, that you do psychoeducation too, is that providing people with choices, would you put it in that kind of way? 

00:10:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, the psychoeducational part of what I do is understanding that people need information that a lot of times where people get hurt is by their own ignorance. By the things-, it was Mark Twain who said it isn't what you don't know that'll hurt you so much as what you do know that isn't really so. And I think that Mark Twain was half right about that. And I think it's also true that the things that you don't know can hurt you, and so a lotta what I run into is people operating on the basis of information that they think is factually correct that isn't. Or people making decisions on the basis of inadequate information, or sometimes even no information that ends up hurting them. But they don't recognize their own blind spots, and so that's part of what I serve as, is a second pair of eyes. 

00:11:25
DIANE JIOS How does this, uh, compare with, uh, their, um, approaches to brief therapy, you talked about being hypnotic and strategic, and can you kind of places this? And you also talked about cognitive and- 

00:11:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, certainly I think that my work is an assimilation of a lot of what works. Uh, as somebody who researches and writes books, I'm certainly aware of clinical literature, and the research literature, and I'm aware of what works from advocacy studies, and I'm also pretty tuned in to how people function. And, and what matters in people's lives. So I think that my work reflects a synthesis of many different common components of brief therapy. I think that having a solution orientation, being work, working on solving problems, and developing solutions is pretty typical of brief therapy. I think having a therapeutic alliance is a critical factor. I think providing people with direction as well as support to move in positive directions is one of the common denominators. So I think that my work reflects a variety of brief therapy approaches quite well. 

00:12:40
JON CARLSON You've written on a variety of topics, you mentioned your books and what one that's, you know, your works seems to stand out in areas of depression. And anxiety work. Do you vary your approach or is this kind of a one size fits all model? I mean what are the st-, are the steps the same across the pathology? 

00:12:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I think that anybody who has any familiarity with my work knows how much importance I place on adjusting to individuals. Adjusting to their individual styles of organizing information, tailoring it to the nature of the individual. Now there will always be certain common denominators of human experience. You know, we all speak a language and yet we express ourselves in very different ways. And so I try and identify a lot of the common denominators of what kinds of skills people typically need to learn in order to become depression free or to reduce their anxiety or to achieve whatever it is that they're trying to do. But I think the real artistry in therapy and therapy is, I think, at least as much art as it is science, I think the real artistry is how you take the relevant principles and make them palatable to the individual. How you tailor them to the needs of the specific individuals that you're working with. Having answers, having information, having skills, having techniques, that this person doesn't particularly want to avail themselves of doesn't further anything. So ultimately it's the client who runs the show. 

00:14:15
DIANE JIOS So are there clients that it doesn't, you just don't, I can't work with, or does it, can you pretty well adapt them? 

00:14:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well I think that, you know, the mental health profession is always struggling with the kinds of more severe and extreme kinds of problems that are, uh, refractory and difficult to treat. But I think the kinds of people that respond best to brief therapy approaches are the people who are looking for information, looking for solutions, the people who are willing to explore, they're willing to experiment. And I think that that's some of what clients bring to the therapy. But I also think it's part of the way that the therapist defines the therapeutic interaction. From my standpoint, for example, I want this person to know from the moment they walk in the door, that I'm on their side, I want them to accomplish what they came here to accomplish, and that we're gonna work together on the problem. And developing a solution, that it's not going to be you against me, it's gonna be us against whatever it is that we're trying to do. So I think that the-, the client who benefit the most are the ones who are willing to experiment. The ones who are willing to try something new, and I play a role in helping facilitate that willingness to experiment. 

00:15:35
JON CARLSON Is there research support for this approach? 

00:15:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, when it's a synthesis of so many different approaches, each of the approaches that I use has a very strong empirical base. There is a tremendous amount of research supporting the value of cognitive therapy. Tremendous amount of research supporting the value of behavior therapy, and interpersonal therapy as well. As all, uh, useful and efficacious approaches to treating depression. Hypnosis isn't a therapy. Hypnosis is a way of delivering ideas. Communicating ideas. But is there even research supporting the value of hypnosis, and the answer is yes, that when we compare, for example, behavior-, cognitive behavioral interventions, without hypnosis, with cognitive behavioral interventions with hypnosis, hypnosis clearly has an effect of enhancing the overall value of the therapy. So each of the aspects of what I do has been empirically validated. 

00:16:30
DIANE JIOS Here in a few minutes we're gonna watch you work with a man who reports that he's depressed, and I'm curious to know what did you, what do you think about before you start the session? What are you looking for? 

00:16:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, when I begin a session, of course, I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm utterly ignorant. And what I have to do is keep myself in a frame of mind where I'm observant, where I am more externally oriented, rather than internally oriented. Focused on the client. What are the cues what are the pieces of information that this person's revealing to me that will help me organize my approach? So I'm specifically listening for the kinds of language that the person uses. I'm interested in how the person's states what their goals are, I'm interested in how this person describes what the limitations are in the things that they've done before, or the ways that they've already tried to solve problems. How they continue to maintain a symptomatic experience so ultimately what I'm looking for is what are the kinds of things that this person's gonna need in order to be able to do what they came here to do? 

00:17:40
DIANE JIOS Now I've heard something about you working with elephants. Would you tell me a little bit about that? Tell Jon and I a little about that? 

00:17:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, I-, I had the most amazing experience a few years ago. I think most people are familiar with the San Diego Zoo, it's the world famous zoological park. And what many people don't know is that there's also a sister park, called the San Diego Wild Animal Park, and both parks are run by the zoological society of Sand Diego, and both have as a highest priority, the preservation of endangered species, and the breeding of endangered species. Well as you may or may not know, elephants are a very highly endangered species. And unless captive breeding is successful, their on an extinction schedule of about 20 years. And to me the idea of a world without elephants at this point is excruciating. But captive breeding is a very difficult process, it's a very dangerous process. There's only three places in the United States that will even attempt breeding, because keeping bull elephants around is a very dangerous proposition. They get aggressive when they go through periods called must. And so the zoological society called me up and they said we currently have a herd of 23 elephants, we want to establish a breeding colony of 120 elephants. And I said, I'm a psychologist, and you must have a wrong number, and he said, well, we'll tell you in a moment why we need you. You can't just advertise for elephant trainers in the newspaper. So to accommodate a herd of 120, they were gonna need to have many more trainers, many more keepers, and so the question was how can we train the keepers so that they're safe. Elephant handlers, elephant trainers, routinely get injured and killed, it's actually a very dangerous profession. And so, the lead elephant trainer was a fellow named Allen who was very skilled with the elephants. But when you ask him how do you do what you do, his answer was a very insightful, I don't know. So, they, they hired me to come out to the park to follow Allen around to learn how he does what he does, using the skills that I have been talking about, of observing how people do things well, in order to then develop a training program for the new trainers in keepers coming on. So over the span of the next six months, I learned more about elephants, and elephant-human interaction than any psychologist you are likely to meet for the rest of your life. And, uh, I ended up stayin' for three years because I just couldn't leave, I love elephants. I mean, I've always liked elephants, but I am now head over heels in love with elephants. And so uh, I learned a whole lot about elephants. And for me it was a very very important developmental thing, because it was the first time that I have taken these kinds of skills that I have been talking about, and applied them in a very urgent context outside the therapy context. It was a very stark reminder that the world is much larger than my therapy office. 

00:20:30
DIANE JIOS Interesting how people do things well. 

00:20:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO How people do things well. 

00:20:35
JON CARLSON Well, you're our elephant, and what we wanna do is is to watch you work with Mike. Can you set that up for our viewers so they might have a little, uh, rather than, I don't know. 

00:20:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay well, here's a situation that the two of you presented to me of coming here to do a session with somebody that I have never met before. Somebody that was, uh, drawn from the local community here. So it's a bonafide client who is presenting, uh, genuine problems, this isn't an actor. And so of course coming into a session like this I have no way of knowing am I gonna be able to say anything useful or do anything useful. And so, uh, this particular client is fellow named Mike who presents uh, as moderately depressed, and, uh, I know nothing else about him, as we begin the session, and here's how we start. 

00:21:30
DIANE JIOS And I wanna ask you one more question about Mike, and, that is I know, you talked about Mike coming in. Mike came in with, he's been working with a student counselor. And, what kind of advice did you, or would you give that counselor in working with Mike over the next, um, few sessions. 

00:21:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I think as a follow up to our session, I would certainly want to uh, continue along the path of making sure that he effectively compartmentalizes past in this respect, not using the past as a reference point for predicting the future. And making decisions. I would certainly want to help him, uh, be the better husband and father that he wants to be since one of the things that he describes is how the past intrudes in his relationship with his current family. And I would certainly want to help, uh, him continue to develop an awareness of his resources. Uh, as he will comment at the end of this session, this is the first time ever that he spent any time with himself in a way that was positive, in a way that was focusing on good things. And I would certainly want to continue to expand the range of good things that he can find internally, so that his feelings about himself will continue to grow in more positive directions. 

00:22:50
JON CARLSON Great. Let's watch, this is the first therapy I know that also works with elephants. Thanks Michael. 

00:23:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Thank you. Hi. What is your name, and, what would you like help with? 

00:23:10
MIKE Uh, Mike, and, um, I've been carrying like a lotta emotional baggage for a long time. And, um, you know, it just seems to affect me ev-, you know, like daily. You know, I can't seem to, like break free of things. You know, and, um, just seems like, you know I have constant reminders of things that have happened in the past. 

00:23:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO So when you say emotional baggage, what do you mean exactly? 

00:23:45
MIKE In what way you mean? Or where did it come from? Or- 

00:23:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Al of the above. 

00:23:50
MIKE Okay, um- 

00:23:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Reader's Digest version. 

00:23:50
MIKE Well, uh, a lot of it, you know, is from like the last 34 years. You know, of my life, it just seems like one bad thing after another, or you know, uh, a lot of it stems I think from my father. You know, um, growin' up was just seems like full of twists and turns, you know it was, a lot of hittin' kickin' slappin' throwin' down stairs, hit with bats, belts, boots, um, like verbally called probably every name you could think of. Um, you know past is probably you know, running away, foster homes, it's like the tip of you, you know. 

00:24:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And so with that kind of pretty nasty background, how does it affect the choices that you're making today? 

00:25:05
MIKE It seems, a lotta times that I second guess myself all the time, you know, I'm not really sure exactly which way to move without constant replaying things in my head. Or, you know it just seems like I'm kinda stuck in the gutter. You know, and can't get out. And so- 

00:25:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Stuck in terms of your ability to do what? 

00:25:30
MIKE Function a lotta times. It seems like a, it weighs me down, and, uh, you know I'm married and I have two children and it seems to affect them also, you know. Um, where there's an emotional distance a lotta times. 

00:25:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO How does thos-, who do those kinds of past experiences become a basis for emotional distance in your own family? 

00:26:00
MIKE Because it seems whether I talk to people or, or things, you know, there's a lotta times there could be facial expressions that people make, or smells, or just anything. And it seems like pictures click when it happens. And, somebody may say something, whatever and then for a long time after I get home I may just be in another world, you know, just thinking. You know. 

00:26:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Stewing about it, thinking about it. 

00:26:30
MIKE A little of both. You know. And then I always thinkin' you know well maybe I shoulda done this better. Different. 

00:26:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO All right, and so when you say those kinds of things to yourself, then what happens? 

00:26:45
MIKE I seem to get caught up in it. You know. Um- 

00:26:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Do you always have that kinda running commentary going on through your mind? That kind of evaluation about yourself, that kind of assessment about how you're doing and what you said, and what you did, and do you always pay attention to it? 

00:27:05
MIKE A lotta times. I shouldn't say 100 percent of the time, but you know a lotta times I do. 

00:27:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO How do you know whether it's worth listening to? 

00:27:15
MIKE I don't. 

00:27:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Have you ever had the experience of uh, discovering that some of that things that run through your mind aren't particular helpful to you? And you don't really need to focus on it? 

00:27:35
MIKE Yeah there's been times that, you know, I think that you know it just, you know, what somebody has said or something just doesn't amount to a whole lot, you know. 

00:27:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And then, you let it go? 

00:27:45
MIKE Yeah, sometimes I do, but it just seems like words can hurt word-, you know, hurt worse than punches, you know. 

00:28:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay. But, if I criticize you, how do you know whether to pay attention to it, how do you know whether to listen to it, how do you know whether to take it seriously or whether to dismiss it? 

00:28:10
MIKE I seem to take a lotta things seriously. It could be just joking, whatever, but I do take it serious. 

00:28:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay, but the question I'm really askin' is how do you know whether you should take it seriously? You're tellin' me that you do take it seriously, but I'm askin' a question of how do you know whether you should? 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
MIKE I don't. 

00:28:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay. It seems to me that that would be a really valuable thing for you to be able to have. Is some internal mechanism that helps you decide whether or not it's worth paying attention to. You know one of the things, I don't know if you've ever talked to other people about the inner voices, that they have inside their own heads, where they replay bad things that have happened, and the self-criticisms that they generate, and all the junk that goes on up there. But if you were to do what I do, which is when I have hundreds of people in a room and I ask 'em, who among you has good self-esteem? Hands go up, not many, but some hands go up. Then I'll ask 'em, do you have an inner critic, do you have a voice inside your head that criticizes you and says rotten things to you and puts you down and says mean horrible things to you? And every single one says yes. And I ask 'em, well, if you have a voice that says rotten things to you, how can you have good self-esteem? And the interesting reply, it's always a little bit different, but the common bottom line is, they don't listen to it. And when I ask 'em how do you not listen to it, that's when I start learning all kinds of different strategies, one person'll say well, I picture it bein' on a volume control knob, and I just turn the volume down, somebody else says, I picture it as a barking dog tied to a tree, and I just keep walkin'. Somebody else says, uh, you know, I have another voice on my shoulder that says good things to me. But the interesting thing is that every single person has that inner critic, that critical voice, it's just a question of whether they listen to it or not. Now to me that was a very, very powerful learning from bein' around and asking those kinds of questions of literally thousands of people. But you'll notice and the question that I ask you, do you have some mechanism whereby you don't have to listen to it, where you decide it's not offering me anything valuable here, all it's doing is keeping me stuck in the gutter and you said. Without that kind of a mechanism you're always gonna be stuck listenin' to it. And when is it ever gonna say anything to you other than negative stuff? It's not as if it's ever gonna say to you, gee Mike you're great, gee Mike, you're wonderful. Aren't you the best, aren't you lucky to be who you are. You know, that's, that's not what people who feel good about themselves do. So, you know, in a way I'm kinda givin' you a target to aim for, that A, having the ability to develop a mechanism for not listening to it when you know that it's taking you someplace that you really don't wanna go. Because when are you ever going to escape all the triggers? When are you gonna escape the sounds, the smells, the images. You could be watchin' a television show, you can be watchin' a movie, you can-, I mean the triggers are always gonna be out there. We're not gonna be able to change the external world. But what goes on inside your mind is imminently negotiable. So now, have you ever evaluated the value of the things you tell yourself? Has it ever been an option for you, in other words, not to pay attention to it? 

00:31:45
MIKE I try to, but a lotta times it you know, seem to remember and it, kinda always comes back. You know. 

00:31:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It will, but now the question is how you respond to it when you have the memories, or when you have the images. When you have a memory come up, of something bad that's happened to you, you can either focus on it, or not, I'd like to hear about the times that you do either. Tell me about the times that you do focus on it, and what happens, and tell me about the times that you don't focus on it. And tell me what happens. 

00:32:25
MIKE The times I focus on bad things I just I guess my escape from it, you know, is I just feel it build up. You know, and, uh, a lotta times at work, or somethin' I just have to get outta there real quick, you know and I just seem to cry for a long time, you know. And um, that's, that's probably how I just try to vent it out, you know. The good times when people, you know when people say things, you know, I guess there's a lotta times you try to prove 'em wrong. You know, and, um, I know that a lotta times you know when people say things, that I guess it just it seems to just, uh, you know, like a magnet or somethin', you know, stick on ya, you know, and it's hard to get away from it, but a lotta times I just try to tell myself like no, Mike, you know, that's not true. You know. And, so it's hard, you know, I mean it's a, it's not easy to just say uh, forget it. You know it's not right, you know. So. 

00:33:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO No, it isn't easy. But it's a skill worth developing. Because you will have how many things thrown at you for the rest of your life. And the idea is to get good at being able to dodge'em, and weave around 'em, and not take 'em in, not be the magnet for the things stickin' on you. And, you know, there are a lotta different ways of accomplishing that. Have you done any kind of focusing work, hypnotic work, relaxation work, imagery work, ever? 

00:34:15
MIKE No, no. 

00:34:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now that would be a very interesting way for you to get absorbed in a different style of thought about these kinds of things. And if you're actually open to doing that kind of a session, I'd love to do that with you. 

00:34:30
MIKE Okay. 

00:34:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You feel okay about doin' that? 

00:34:30
MIKE Yeah. 

00:34:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay. What I'm gonna do is just talk about some different ideas, different possibilities, there really isn't anything that you have to do. But what I hope will happen is that as you're listening to me, you start to get more absorbed in the things that I'm talkin' about. That it'll start to open up some different possibilities for you, different ways of responding. Because as I said, it's not the world that's gonna change, it's gonna be your internal experience, how you respond to these things. So if you feel okay about doin' that, then I'd say just sit back in the chair, get yourself comfortable- 

00:35:05
MIKE All right. 

00:35:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And, uh, let me introduce the idea of focusing to you. All right? If, um, you're comfortable the way that you're sitting, that's fine, what I'd suggest that you do is let your eyes close, and take in a few deep breaths, and just orient yourself for a couple of minutes. To the notion of absorbing yourself in a different way of thinking about your own experience. Now you probably haven't thought about it this way before, but when you get absorbed in the past, the negative feelings of things that have gone on, you can get so absorbed in it that you really don't see other ways of thinking. Other ways of feeling. But one of the things that-, that's potentially valuable about taking a few minutes to just sit quietly the way you are now, is that it gives you the freedom to explore other parts of yourself. You know you're much, much more than your past, Mike. And that phrase of being much more than your past is going to surface at different times. And different places. But when I encourage you to start thinking a little differently about yourself and your experience, and to go exploring with in yourself, there are strengths that you have that you use to cope that you've used to build a different life for yourself. Being married, having your own family. Things that you have clearly left behind. Now in this kind of an experience, where I invite you, to step outside your usual experience of yourself, there's several things that can be especially important. One is for you to know that your internal experience is changeable. And of course you'll notice that first in superficial ways, breathing, slowing down, muscles getting more relaxed, mind wandering less, and less. And then little by little as the momentum builds, and you start to discover in yourself places and things that fell good to you, situations even memories that you'd forgotten about of things that were quite nice. The good people that you've met along the way. People that went outta their way to do somethin' nice for you. Small things that you'd forgotten about. And little by little, the reality of what I mean when I say that you're more than your past can start to drift in your awareness. You have goals. Ways that you want the future to be different than the past. Ways that you wanna be able to connect with your wife, you kids, ways that you wanna evolve friendships with people. And all the while knowing that it's the things that you say to yourself through your thoughts that make all the difference. And how you feel. Now certainly you know that you're mind is capable of generating lots of different things. Audio clips and video clips. From different life experiences. But it's so interesting when you in a more comfortable state of mind. You realize that those are things that can just drift past, and never really stick to you. Things that can just float by, that you never latch onto. Or give time to. And when I said everyone has the voices it's interesting is how they can grow quiet how they can become easy to ignore. How other aspects of your experience can take over. There are already things that you've done, Mike, that you wouldn't have predicted from your past. And it's easy to appreciate that. An impersonal levels as well as personal ones. 100 years ago nobody would have predicted space shuttles and space stations. Things change. 100 years ago, nobody would have predicted paved roads everywhere in this country. We're flying around the world in a matter of hours. And of course what I'm really saying is for you to use your past to predicted the future. It becomes more and more difficult as you begin to fill your future with more things that remind you that you're more than that. And it's literally as if a wall is built between what you're experiencing now and what you'll experience tomorrow. And what you experienced before. And whether you use the actual image of a wall to separate past from present, present from future, or whether you use some other divider, all I know is the things that have gone before have increasingly less and less influence. On the choices that you make today. Tomorrow. All of your tomorrows. I want you to notice your breathing has slowed, Mike, muscle tone is more relaxed. To get absorbed in a comfortable way. To know that you can go inside yourself and find good experiences. Simple pleasures. The look on your child's face when you do something funny and unexpected. The simple things that remind you of the extraordinary range of feelings you're capable of. Perceptions you're capable of. Understandings that you're capable of. And to slowly but steadily build a wall around what was in order to create an endless array of possibilities for what can be. And in the same way that I say you're more than your past, I also wanna remind you the future hasn't happened yet. Now you noticed some shifts even in the way your body feels. And perhaps in your thoughts and perceptions as well. I really won't know until you're describing those those understandings to me. In a little while. But here's an experience that you allowed because you trusted yourself in this very new situation with me, who you've never met before, you trusted yourself to deal with whatever I might say or do. You trusted yourself to deal with the spontaneity the unexpected. And that's an important thing, Mike. Because there doesn't have to be trust out in the world, or predictability out in the world. Or even safety out in the world. There only has to be your internal awareness. That you can deal with it. 

00:47:20
[sil.] 

00:47:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now someone wise once said that the best way to predict the future is to create it. And with every interaction that you have with your own family, the one that you've created, you have an opportunity to do things better. You have an opportunity to discover what's right about you. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And so, at this point, take a moment just to review different things that I said. Your reactions, the things that you can take with you from this experience. That you can really use. And if you find yourself remembering that there are a lot of different ways of responding to voices from the past, from turning down the volume button, picturing a barking dog tied to a tree, just walkin' right past it, or the ever popular therapist response thanks for sharing, or any options that you generate, that make it abundantly clear you don't have to listen to what isn't useful. Take whatever time you want to Mike to process your thoughts, feelings, reactions, take a moment to consolidate, absorb the deeper implications. Then when you feel like you're ready to, and want to, you can start the process of reorienting yourself, reconnecting with this environment, and me. Letting your eyes open whenever you're ready. Take your time. 

00:50:15
[sil.] 

00:50:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Hi. How you doin'? 

00:50:30
MIKE Hi. Good. 

00:50:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You wanna tell me about it? 

00:50:40
MIKE I saw a lotta things. That I'm capable of feelings, that I've used talents that I thought I didn't have, but I have. 

00:51:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Were you thinking of specific examples during that time? Or just a general awareness of that- 

00:51:05
MIKE Just general, yeah, um. 

00:51:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And how did that feel? 

00:51:10
MIKE Felt good. 

00:51:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Did it? 

00:51:15
MIKE Yeah, felt real good. Um, almost like I could imagine like a wilted flower, but I could imagine just, even though things have got me down, that I am capable of standing up. Um, the other things that I realized was that I'm limiting myself to everything whether it's work, or, you know, um, I also noticed that I processed real quick just different things have said over the past. But they aren't true. Uh, I also, you know, like saw my children, you know. And I just, I realized that you know I have a terrific influence over them. Whether it's positive or negative, I have that influence over them. 

00:52:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It's great that you realize that. 

00:52:25
MIKE And, the thing that, the distance wise, I kinda really focused on that for a minute. And I'm-, I'm living in the past, I'm not living in the present. and so I'm not accepting things for what they are. I've already got 'em doomed before they start. I, uh- 

00:52:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That's a very important realization. 

00:53:00
MIKE And I understood about the walls. You know, uh, it's almost like doors and windows, I'm allowing, whether it's emotions, but I picture water coming in through windows and doors. 

00:53:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That's a great image. 

00:53:10
MIKE And so, I-, I'm the one that has to close these windows and doors. And, you know, oh, the other thing I saw was like, or, I pictured like when you're cold, you get a blanket, and it was real interesting. Um, and I also realized that I can be whoever I wanna be. Or do whatever I wanna do, you know. Um- 

00:53:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO There will always be people who tell you can't. 

00:53:45
MIKE Yeah. 

00:53:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO What're you gonna do? 

00:53:50
MIKE Well, what I realized, or, had thought about was when I was talkin' about different abilities and things like, I'm capable of making things happen on my own. And I've used that throughout my life but never took the time to think about it. 

00:54:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, you know, my point about people are gonna tell you that you can't do what you want, I'm hoping your response will be some variation of thanks for sharing. Your own individual response that way, but to not take it in. Because exactly what you're saying about you're the one who makes it happen. So you get to choose. You get to choose. The fact that people throw stuff so what? 

00:54:40
MIKE But I have a choice to listen or not to listen. And so, I should, I need to take in the positive things. And really process what people say in the sense like I can draw off of things. You know, encouragement, uh, but the funny things is, and this is what I, I can't get over, is like I never took, not even five minutes to just relax. I kinda walk around stressed, I walk around, but for just I don't know if it was a minute, two minutes, three minutes, I don't know what it was, but I actually felt, ah- 

00:55:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Could even see it in your body, as well as on your face. See, to me that's an important thing, for you to be able to spend time with yourself in a way where you like what's in there. Where you can go inside and say there's good stuff in there. I mean I can run and play and do whatever I want inside my head and it doesn't really matter what is going externally at those times. And that's, that's what's rejuvenating, that's what's replenishing, highlights for you exactly what I meant at the end when I talked about the range of things that you're capable of. And when you've got this much range, it just stay right in one narrow band, it's certainly unnecessarily limiting. And you seem to get that. 

00:56:25
MIKE I, what, what come to mind is, I remember seeing on TV one time where somebody took a piece of paper, and put a little dot, and said what do you see? And you focused in on that little dot. 

00:56:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, yeah, so this-, it is all about perception And it seems like you got that. Which is great. Is that the kind of experience, uh, given that it was your first time, with it and you did this well, um, something that you'd be interested in pursuing? 

00:56:55
MIKE Oh yes. 

00:56:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I think it'd be a good skill. A really good skill for you to develop. And there are ways of doing that from, uh, um, perhaps the counselor that you're workin' with, can pick up and do these kinds of things with you, uh, but certainly there are, there's a world full of tapes, relaxation tapes, visualization tapes, kaidemetry (ph) tapes, those are great things. More importantly developing the ability on your own. To be able to just sit down wherever you are, whether it's at work or whatever, or even you come home stressed, which is gonna happen, and you don't wanna take it out on your family, and so you go spend 10 minutes calmin' yourself down, and where you can come back in and, you know, you feel great about bein' with 'em, and it shows. And it shows. And those are the things where you highlight to yourself over and over again. I'm good, you know, I can do these things. You know, and reinforce for yourself that you're way past whatever it was before. It's important. 

00:57:55
MIKE Yeah. 

00:58:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That's good. 

00:58:00
MIKE I do-, I feel real good. I do. 

00:58:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well that's good. 

00:58:05
MIKE I'm, I'm, I need to step outside of what I'm in. 

00:58:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Always. Always, I mean to me what one of the things I hope will be a lasting thing from this session is that anything that floats through your brain isn't worth airtime until you decide it's worth air time. I mean your brain is capable of generating all kinds of junk. My brains capable. You know I mean, the percentage of thoughts that I have that are actually worth payin' attention to, I'd hate to put a number on it, but, put it this way, there's a lotta things that go flowin' through my mind that just aren't worth payin' attention to. And that's true for any human being. Not every thought's golden, not every insights meaningful, not every, uh, perception is worth following up on. And for you who hasn't previously had a discrimination strategy, an ability to decide is this worth focusing on or isn't it, where it's just been automatic for you to take it in and respond to it, I imagine it's been very, very stressful trying to keep up with all that, sort it, and live with it. 

00:59:15
MIKE It is. 

00:59:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And, um, what I'm hoping you now have as a choice is, filtering out a whole bunch of stuff, spend time with yourself in a way that's comfortable, and just gettin' a charge out of the little things, the smiles, the touches, the sunsets, the all the little things that make life good. 

00:59:40
MIKE And it is good. You know. It is good, because, yeah, it is. 

00:59:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Overall. Overall. I mean, there is crummy things that happen in life, but there's good things that happen too. That sounds actually like, you've got some good things going. 

00:59:55
MIKE I do. 

00:59:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, it sounds it. Enjoy it. 

01:00:00
MIKE I will. 

01:00:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Very nice to meet you Mike. 

01:00:00
MIKE You too. 

01:00:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Thanks. 

01:00:00
MIKE Thank you. 

01:00:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay. You did great. For a first time doing it, it was, uh- 

01:00:15
JON CARLSON Michael, that was awesome. The way that the changes that took place, things were just, you could just see the changes in this young man. Is this typical of the work that you do? 

01:00:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I certainly have a strong belief in people having a lot more resources than they realize. And I think that Mike discovered a lotta resources, and it made a big difference for him, and, uh, I think in that respect, it's very typical, that people have much more than they realize. 

01:00:45
JON CARLSON That was brief therapy. 

01:00:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO That was brief therapy. 

01:00:50
DIANE JIOS Uh, you know, just the, uh, the color his face, the expressions, his body, the way he was holding himself. If you took a clip from the beginning of that, and then you took a clip from the end, you'd almost wonder if it was the same person. It was, uh- 

01:01:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Pretty marked before and after, but that's really my experience when you give people new choices, and teach them the new skills that they really need. And I think that Mike was very receptive to that, and I feel lucky that I had the chance to work with him. 

01:01:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I'm really going to be curious to listen to you talk about pieces of this so I can get a sense of how you knew what you needed to do through that process. Because I'm fascinated by the way that worked. 

01:01:25
JON CARLSON Now before we jump into that, I'm interested if you were to return in seven to 10 days and see Mike, where would you go next, I mean, where would you go after that? 

01:01:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well I would certainly wanna know how well he has beg-, evolved the ability to make the kinds of discriminations that I was wanting to teach him to make. And I would certainly want to know something about how well he's been able to evolve the skills of compartmentalizing, and so based on his feedback in the next session I would continue to reinforce what I've already begun, or if he's already gotten good with those kinds of skills, move on to being able to help him do more with his family, and do more about goal planning, and the kinds of things that help him really consolidate the learning that the future isn't gonna be just more of the same. 

01:02:10
JON CARLSON So what you're gonna do is begin with an assessment, and that's pretty much what you do with each of, uh- 

01:02:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, feedback is critical. Obviously I have no way of knowing how he's doing, or what he's assimilated, what he's integrated without asking him about it. So, certainly the very first thing that I would do the next time that we meet is ask him, how's it going, how're you doing with these particular issues, you know what do you find yourself doing better, what are the things that you'd still like to be able to do better, and then my task really is how can I help him continue to evolve those skills. 

01:02:45
JON CARLSON Let's watch how you open this session with Mike. And as we, as you begin a session, like with this one, what are you looking for? 

01:02:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, I'm really interested in a number of different things. One, obviously I'm interested in what is it that this person is trying to do. What are the person's goals, what are the kinds of problems that they're experiencing. And then I'm wanting to get some sense of the person's ability to focus, I wanna know how has the person generated the symptoms. Not why, but how the person has generated the symptoms. And so the, the focus really for me is on, uh, the structure of how the person does whatever it is that they're doing. Because that's the cue to me about what I wanna be able to help them do differently. 

01:03:25
JON CARLSON Well let's watch this first piece, and uh, see what happens. 

01:03:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Hi. What is your name, and, what would you like help with? 

01:03:40
MIKE Uh, Mike, and, um, I've been carrying like a lotta emotional baggage for a long time. And, um, you know, it just seems to affect me ev-, you know, like daily. You know, I can't seem to, like break free of things. You know, and, um, just seems like, you know I have constant reminders of things that have happened in the past. 

01:04:10
JON CARLSON What did Mike's presentation mean for you? 

01:04:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well certainly the first thing that struck me is that here is a man who is moderately depressed, and he actually fits what is a fairly typical profile for depression sufferers in that he is very preoccupied with the past, the past is very influential in terms of the way that he feels now, and the way that he even thinks about his own future. And so it certainly starts to tell me right off the bat- 

01:04:35
JON CARLSON 30 seconds. 

01:04:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO What kinds of skills I'm gonna need to help him develop. And certainly one of those skills that he's gonna need is the ability to compartmentalize. So that the past doesn't continue to affect the kinds of choices that he makes today, and tomorrow. 

01:04:50
JON CARLSON In a minute we're gonna watch a piece where you do actually uh, look at how the past impacts his present situation. Can you talk a little bit about that and set that up for our viewers? 

01:05:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, what I'm interested in, in asking the question is how specifically the past infects the present and the future. What is it about his past experience that he find intrusive, how is the past being used as the reference point for predicting the future and for moderating the kinds of responses that he generates, and of course what I'm wanting to do is find out what the specifics are so that I know what kinds of patterns to interrupt, and what kinds of skills I wanna build. 

01:05:30
JON CARLSON So the details you're looking for are in patterns, not so much in details in terms of specific memories. 

01:05:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, right, I'm far less interested in what was actually said, and what was actually done, and I'm really much more interested in how those things affect the choices that he's making now. 

01:05:50
JON CARLSON Well let's watch this. 

01:05:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO And so with that kind of, pretty nasty background, how does it affect the choices that you're making today? 

01:06:05
MIKE It seems a lotta times that I second guess myself all the time, you know I'm not really sure exactly which way to move without constantly replaying things in my head, or you know it just seems like I'm kinda stuck in a gutter. You know, and can't get out. And so- 

01:06:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Stuck in terms of your ability to do what? 

01:06:35
MIKE Function, a lotta times. It seems like, uh, it weighs me down. And, uh, you know I'm married and I have two children, and it seems to affect them also. You know, um, where there's an emotional distance, a lotta times. 

01:06:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO How does, tho-, how do those kinds of past experiences become a basis for emotional distance in your own family? 

01:07:00
MIKE Because it seems whether I talk to people or, or things, you know there's a lotta times, there could be facial expressions that people, or smiles, or just anything, and it seems like pictures click, when that happens. And, somebody may say something, whatever, and then for a long time after I get home I may just be in another world, you know, just thinking, you know- 

01:07:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Stewing about it, thinkin' about it? 

01:07:30
MIKE A little of both, you know. 

01:07:35
JON CARLSON Your questions in this piece seem to really be helping him learn that he has choices, that he really doesn't have to pay attention to everything that goes on in his mind. 

01:07:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well certainly he's aware of a lot of intrusive images from the past. He's aware of a lot of internal dialogue that is very harmful, and the fact that these things are going on inside of him is hardly unusual, but as far as I can tell at this point, he doesn't seem to have any mechanism available to him, any particular skill in being able to deal with these things, being able to put them in some kind of compartment, some kind of space within himself where he can tolerate it. 

01:08:15
DIANE JIOS So he just keeps rehashing them, other than saying I don't need to think about that, or, that's past- 

01:08:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Right, and that's so typical of depression, you know, there's a phenomenon known as rumination, spinning around the same things over and over and over again, and clearly, he ruminates to his detriment. And the idea, certainly from my standpoint is one of the things that I'd like to be able to do is interrupt that rumination. 

01:08:40
JON CARLSON In this piece we're gonna watch in a minute, you seem to be educating him about his mind. Is that something that you do? 

01:08:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yes, yes, psychoeducation is a basic part of treatment, I think. Helping people understand more about the way their minds work. And the more that they understand, the more that they can, A, normalize things that might have previously seemed deviant to them, or pathological to them, and kinda take the stigma off themselves in that respect. And B, help them get more control over their own fundamental processes. The fact that he has these external triggers is not unusual. They will always be there. Now the question is how can he respond differently to those things. 

01:09:25
JON CARLSON The language that you use, though, is, uh, is so much friendlier than a neuroanatomy course, in terms of, you know, what actually goes on in one's mind. How do you know the words to use, or the metaphors that you use? 

01:09:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, actually those are two different questions. You know a lot of the language that I use comes from the client themselves, and a lotta the metaphors that I use are just everyday examples of things that illustrate the kinds of learnings that I'm trying to get across. And if you think about what's most powerful in people's experience, what's most powerful in shaping their perceptions, it is their own experience, the kinds of everyday things that they've been exposed to, but never really seen it that way before, never really thought about it that way before. So for me personally the metaphors that I try and use the most frequently are the ones that come directly out of the client's own experience. 

01:10:20
JON CARLSON So it's the focus on their words and their stories, are the, where you base your your explanations- 

01:10:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, well it's his internal world that I'm trying to change. And, you know, it's his way of viewing himself, his way of viewing his own feelings, his way of processing his own, uh, thoughts. Uh, obviously what regulates peoples' experiences is their own subjective viewpoints and interpretations about the meaning of life experiences, and so ultimately we're dealing with each person's own internal worldview, and that's what we're trying to change. 

01:10:55
DIANE JIOS You know, it's probably kind of a provocative question, but, we're somewhere about four or five minutes into your interview, how do you get a sense of his internal world this quickly? 

01:11:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well there are things that I'm wanting to assess. I'm wanting to assess how internally absorbed he is versus how externally focused he is on me. Whether, in other words, he's gonna be more inner directed, or whether he's gonna be more outer directed. I certainly wanna know something about his ability to focus, and pay attention, and that's what helps me decide whether I wanna engage in a more hypnotic kind of an approach, or whether I wanna give him something much more concrete and structured. So there, there are cues that are coming from him, even in terms of the language that he used, whether he's very specific and very concrete, or whether he's much more abstract about things, whether he's much more linear in-, in seeing things happen in sequential ways, or whether he responds to things in a much more global way. So even the language that he uses is starting to give me clues as to what matters to him. 

01:11:55
JON CARLSON Let's watch your language as you help him to understand how he ticks. 

01:12:00
MIKE A little of both. You know. And then always, you know, thinkin' well maybe I shoulda done this better, different- 

01:12:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO All right, and so when you say those kinds of things to yourself, then what happens. 

01:12:15
MIKE I seem to get caught up in it. You know. Um- 

01:12:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Do you always have that kind of running commentary going on through your mind? That kind of evaluation about yourself, that kind of assessment about how you're doing, and what you said, and what you did. And do you always pay attention to it? 

01:12:35
MIKE A lotta times, I shouldn't say 100 percent of the time, but you know a lotta the times I do. 

01:12:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO How do you know whether it's worth listening to? 

01:12:50
MIKE I don't. 

01:12:50
JON CARLSON That was really surprising that you teach him how to discriminate, and like he'd never been aware of this before. 

01:13:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, one of the things that I think of as being a very important part of the work that I do is identifying what I've come to call the experiential deficit. And by that I mean very simply the-, the things that the person knows that really are not so, or the things that they don't know that are hurting them. And what I find so often particularly in depression, is that people have a specific deficit of not bein' able to make certain discriminations. So for example they don't know when to listen to their feelings and when not to listen to their feelings. They don't know when they should trust somebody and when they shouldn't trust somebody. They don't know when to disclose or when not to disclose. And in fact I could list dozens and dozens of things that people don't know how to discriminate that end up becomin' the basis for the kinds of problems that they have. Well in this particular case with Mike, he doesn't seem to have a discrimination strategy for how to know when to listen to the different things that he tells himself, and when to ignore them. He's apparently operating on the premise that everything that he thinks is worth exploring. Everything that he thinks is worth considering, everything that he thinks deserves airtime. And that's actually confirmed for me when I ask the how question, you'll notice my questions begin with how, not why. How do you know what's worth listening to? And his answer is, I don't. 

01:14:15
DIANE JIOS And it wasn't a quick answer, it was like he went inside and made a check, and then said I don't. Yeah- 

01:14:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO He had to think about it, and that, that kind of response and the pause there tells you that you really hit the experiential deficit. That's the gap that's been in his awareness that he's never realized before, so that by even asking the question, it opened him up to something that he'd never really realized before, and could verbalize. I don't- 

01:14:45
DIANE JIOS And if you had stopped right there, you would have had something to take with it. 

01:14:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Even if I had stopped right there. But of course identifying the deficit isn't the same as correcting for it. And I should also say that, you know when I talk about a deficit, I'm clearly very aware that people are resourceful, and as you'll see as we progress with the session with Mike, he's resourceful. But there are, not everybody knows everything, and very often it's the things that we don't know that hurt us. And so, it's, it's certainly not meant to be demeaning in any way as much as it is to say people have blind spots. And what we wanna be able to do is help them develop an awareness for the things that they haven't been aware of that have been hurtful to them. 

01:15:30
JON CARLSON In this next piece, you seem to be teaching again. What else is goin' on here? 

01:15:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, at this point I'm actually beginning the hypnotic induction. I'm using myself as the focal point in introducing a metaphor to him about the fact that I can and have interviewed hundreds if not thousands of people who all have the same common denominator of an inner critic, the self-critical voice, and highlighting for him that for the people who manage to have good self-esteem, the people who managed to maintain some resistance to depression, they have developed the ability to ignore that voice through one mechanism or another. So I'm now introducing to him for the first time, a very important discrimination strategy that you have the choice, you don't have to listen to everything that goes floatin' through your mind. 

01:16:20
JON CARLSON Let's watch as hypnosis begins. 

01:16:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now one of the things, I don't know if you've ever talked to other people about the inner voices, that they have inside their own heads, where they replay bad things that have happened, and the self-criticisms that they generate, and all the junk that goes on up there, but if you were to do what I do, which is when I have hundreds of people in a room and I ask 'em, who among you has good self-esteem? Hands go up, not many, but hands go up, then I'll ask 'em, do you have an inner critic, do you have a voice inside your head that criticizes you and says rotten things to you and puts you down and says mean and horrible things to you? And every single one says yes. And I ask 'em, well, if you have a voice that says rotten things to you, how can you have good self-esteem? And the interesting reply, it's always a little bit different, but the common bottom line is, they don't listen to it. When I ask 'em how do you not listen to it, that's when I start learning all kinds of different strategies one person'll say well, I picture it as being on a volume control knob, and I just turn the volume down. Somebody else says I picture it as a barking dog tied to a tree, and I just keep walking. Somebody else says, uh, you know I have another voice on my shoulder that says good things to me, but the interesting things is that every single person has that inner critic, that critical voice, it's just a question of whether they listen to it or not. Now to me the- 

01:17:55
JON CARLSON The content seems pretty clear in this piece, but it's the process that you are really workin' on, can you tell us about that? 

01:18:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Yeah, one of the patterns that's also very closely associated with depression is rigidity, the person has a very singular response for how they deal with things, and that response doesn't vary with situational cues, doesn't very with context, and so what I'm really wanting to introduce to Mike at this point is the notion of flexibility. That there is, first of all, a goal of building a very specific skill, the skill of being able to ignore feedback from yourself that isn't helpful, feedback that's even harmful, and then introducing the flexibility of look at how many different ways there are of accomplishing this, let me tell you a few of them that people have shared with me. But the idea is to trigger in Mike his own creativity for how my going to learn to ignore that voice. 

01:18:50
JON CARLSON Well the hypnosis is already begun, in this next piece, we're gonna watch you provide a rationale for hypnosis to Mike. Can you talk about this and how that's done, and why it's done? 

01:19:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Sure, one of the distinctions that I make is the distinction between informal hypnosis, which you've just observed, and formal hypnosis, where I announce now I'm going to do hypnosis, so sit back and close your eyes. Now the thing that I have always admired about hypnosis as a therapeutic tool is that here is a way of helping people step outside their usual framework. Step outside their usual way of experiencing themselves. In essence, I'm saying to 'em, I'd like to create an experience where you can experience yourself a little bit differently. I'd like you to be able to be willing to explore and discover things in yourself that you may not have paid attention to before. And so the idea of being able to use hypnosis as a way of getting absorbed, utilizing the fact that Mike already gets absorbed, but in negative things, can I use that same ability to absorb himself in a different direction, by absorbing him in other possibilities, other ways of thinking about himself and his wife, other ways of viewing his own future. So I wanna use hypnosis in a very concentrated way to start to build some new associations, some new ways of thinking about things, some new ways of feeling about things. 

01:20:10
JON CARLSON Is it important to get his permission? 

01:20:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I think when you're doing formal hypnosis, that letting the person know that they're an active participant in the process is a very important thing, for obviously ethical reasons, informed consent makes a difference for one, but for another, the whole idea of helping him move from being a passive victim of his own thoughts, to being ac-, able to actively create an internal state where he feels comfortable, empowers him. And to me it's the empowerment, trite as that may sound, but it's really the empowerment of hypnosis that has initially attracted me to it almost a quarter century ago and got me involved with it all these years. 

01:20:50
JON CARLSON Well let's watch as you ready Mike for hypnosis, formal hypnosis. 

01:21:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO No, it isn't easy. But it's a skill worth developing. Because you will have how many things thrown at you for the rest of your life. And the idea is to get good at being able to dodge'em, and weave around 'em, and not take 'em in, not be the magnet for the things stickin' on you. And, you know, there are a lotta different ways of accomplishing that. Have you done any kind of focusing work, hypnotic work, relaxation work, imagery work, ever? 

01:21:25
MIKE No, no. 

01:21:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Now that would be a very interesting way for you to get absorbed in a different style of thought about these kinds of things. And if you're actually open to doing that kind of a session, I'd love to do that with you. 

01:21:40
MIKE Okay. 

01:21:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO You feel okay about doin' that? 

01:21:45
MIKE Yeah. 

01:21:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Okay. 

01:21:45
JON CARLSON As I watched this, a few phrases stood out for me. Uh, there are a lot of different ways of accomplishing this, and this isn't easy, but, what stands out for you and just what do these phrases mean? 

01:22:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, when I talk about wanting to enhance flexibility or facilitate flexibility, what that means to me is that there is a variety of ways of accomplishing any goal that you wanna accomplish. And where people get trapped so often is that they think there's one right way. It's like even for viewers of this tape, how many different ways are there of approaching therapy? And it isn't really so much that one is better than another, but there are certainly differences between them, there are a lot of different ways of accomplishing the same thing. But for Mike he doesn't realize that. And so the fact that he thinks that this is the way that life is, this is the way it has always been, this is the way it's always going to be, that's the essence of the problem. And when I said earlier how often depressed people will use the past as the reference point, that's one of the structural core components. It's literally as if the person's making predictions for the future, I'll never be happy and then you ask why not and they say it's because I never have been. Using the past as the reference point. So I'll never have a good job, because I've never had one, I'll never have a good relationship, because I never had one, and of course the ever popular I won't be happy till my parents treat me better when I was a kid. So you know for people to get so lost in the past when the message of course that I wanna get across is the past isn't going to be the predictor of the future. You can make new choices now, you can develop new responses now, you can develop new skills now, that'll make a big difference in the way that you feel. 

01:23:30
DIANE JIOS One of the things I noticed on that clip is when you start talking about it, you start, you change your voice, in a sense, you say that would be, you pace that, that would be an interesting way, so you really, you said before you, he was you know, done some induction already, but you're already starting again, the or moving through the induction process. 

01:23:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO See this, the whole artistry of induction from my standpoint is, creating a context. Creating a context in which he can participate, in which he's willing to experiment, in which he's willing to go along with the kind of framework that I'm establishing, and from within that, discovering the resources and abilities that he has that have been unaddressed, undiscovered, unfocused, and bringing those to the fore. 

01:24:20
DIANE JIOS And you've got him really interested right now. 

01:24:20
MICHAEL D. YAPKO He's paying close attention. 

01:24:25
JON CARLSON Can you talk about the voice a little bit that Diane mentioned? She talked about using your voice. 

01:24:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well certainly your voice is one aspect of the hypnotic context, and it isn't deeply important that you have this wonderfully hypnotic voice as much as it is appreciating that each person has a sense of timing, and you wanna be able to join that for one, but for another, you certainly want your voice to be used in a way that's consistent with what you're trying to accomplish. That it's easier for him to relax, it's easier for him to focus. It's easier for him to attain and maintain report with me, if I'm non-threatening, and gentle, and permissive in the way that I approach things, instead of charging in and telling him do this, do this, do this, uh, and you'll notice of course even at the point where, uh, the induction began, I knew that I had a fairly high level of report with him even on a physical level because when I adjusted my position, he mimicked me. So I knew at that point, he's willin' to follow my lead, and it really highlights the importance of my creating a context for him to be able to accomplish the things that he came to this session to accomplish. 

01:25:40
JON CARLSON In this next, uh, segment, we're gonna watch you actually uh, having Mike in a trance state actually doing hypnosis. What's important to you, what were you hoping to accomplish? 

01:25:50
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, there were actually probably half a dozen goals that I had in mind. But if I were to tell you the primary ones, I would say that first of all, I would want him to be able to develop the awareness that the past isn't going to have to continue to infect his future. And in that respect, I wanted to remind him that he's more than his past. And I certainly wanted to help him develop the ability to compartmentalize. You know when you work with people who have had a terrible background, the people who recover the best, the most fully, the fastest, have the ability to make that distinction between past and present. They understand that the bad things happened, but they're not going to let them through compartmentalization skills spill over into the choices that they make today. So I certainly wanted to create that possibility for him. But third, I wanted him to be able to go inside and find positive things in himself. Whenever he's thinking or imaging all that comes up is negative. I wanted to be able to diversify and enhance the range of capabilities that he had. 

01:27:05
JON CARLSON Well let's watch this piece on the hypnosis process. 

01:27:10
MICHAEL D. YAPKO To know that you can go inside yourself and find good experiences. Simple pleasures. The look on your child's face when you do something funny and unexpected. The simple things that remind you of the extraordinary range of feelings you're capable of. Perceptions you're capable of. Understandings that you're capable of. And to slowly but steadily build a wall around what was in order to create an endless array of possibilities for what can be. And in the same way that I say you're more than your past, I also wanna remind you the future hasn't happened yet. 

01:28:50
JON CARLSON As you watch this clip Michael, what did you notice? 

01:28:55
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I certainly noticed that he's very attentive, he's almost hanging on every word that I say, so he's clearly engaged in the process, that's important. And certainly from a nonverbal standpoint when you see the relaxation in his face, the, the small muscle movements that he makes, even the physical relaxation of his body, the slowing of his breathing, that clearly he's processing, and he's engaged in the process. So that is a very valuable thing for me to know. That he's with me, and I'm with him. 

01:29:25
JON CARLSON In this next piece, what we're gonna do is we're gonna watch just his Mike comes out of hypnosis, uh, any comments you might have for our viewers before we watch this? 

01:29:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, when somebody first comes out of hypnosis, they'll open their eyes but my assumption is and awareness is that they're pretty typically still in hypnosis to some extent, that, that coming out of hypnosis is a process not an event, and so I'm interested of course, as he comes out of hypnosis, how he's processing what he's just heard, and then the only way that I have of knowing whether the session has been of any value to him is to as for some feedback. And so I have the opportunity to both ask for some feedback, and to reinforce some of the key learnings of the session. 

01:30:15
JON CARLSON Let's watch. 

01:30:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Hi. How you doin'? 

01:30:35
MIKE Good. 

01:30:35
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Wanna tell me about it? 

01:30:40
MIKE I saw a lotta things. That I'm capable of feelings. That I've used talents that I thought I didn't have, but I have. 

01:31:00
JON CARLSON What's your reaction to his initial feedback? 

01:31:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well, aside from it makin' me feel really good that the session was successful, it certainly highlighted what the whole essence of this work is about. It's helping people discover resources. You know when, when we talk about people being resourceful, the obvious question is that if people have all these resources, then why aren't they using them? And the answer is because to some extent, they're dissociated. The person doesn't have a way to get to these resources, and so for me one way of describing what I do is to say I'm a bridge builder, I build the bridge for how people get from where they are to where they wanna go. For me, it was very important to be able to have Mike develop a sense of empowerment, that he does have more resources than he realizes, that he does have more choice available to him than he has realized. And that a lotta the answers are not gonna be out in the external world, safety isn't gonna be out in the external world. Safety and skill is gonna be in his ability to deal with the things that he faces. And I think that his comment reflects it, he got that. 

01:32:10
DIANE JIOS Yeah, yeah, his body language told you that too, to great extent. 

01:32:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It was very congruent, both verbally and nonverbally. 

01:32:20
JON CARLSON In this final piece we're gonna look at, uh, he's giving you feedback and he's just provided you feedback after feedback after feedback, is that typical? 

01:32:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO It's, it's fairly typical, I would say that uh, when a person is had that kind of an experience, where they have been invited to uh, experience themselves differently. Where they've gotten a chance to get outta their usual frame. The frame in which they live their lives, the symptomatic frame, is what I call it. And they've had the opportunity to see life beyond the immediacy of whatever's been troublesome to them. They usually get pretty excited about it, they get, usually get pretty happy about it, and, uh, it certainly provides them with a sense of optimism for the future that I think is very compelling in helping people especially getting outta depression. 

01:33:10
JON CARLSON It almost made me think that you put something in his water. You know, there was such a dramatic change on his part. Let's watch this last piece. 

01:33:15
MICHAEL D. YAPKO What are you gonna do? 

01:33:20
MIKE Well, what I realized, um, had thought about was when I was talkin' about different abilities and things like, I'm capable of making things happen on my own. And I've used that throughout my life. But never took the time to think about it. 

01:33:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO But you know my point about people are gonna tell you that you can't do what you want, I'm hoping your response will be some variation of, thanks for sharing. Your own individual response that way, but to not take it in. Because it, exactly what you're saying about you're the one who makes it happen. So you get to choose you get to choose. The fact that people throw stuff, so what. 

01:34:10
MIKE But I have a choice to listen or not to listen. And so, I should, I need to take in the positive things. And really process what, what people say in the sense, like I can draw offa things, you know encouragement, uh, but the funny thing is, and, and, this is what I, I, can't get over is, like, I never took, not even five minutes to just, phew, relax. I kinda walk around stressed, I walk around, but for just, I don't know if it was a minute, two minutes, three minutes, whatever it was, but, I actually felt ah. 

01:35:05
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Could even see it in your body as well as in your face. 

01:35:10
JON CARLSON Well as I watched this piece, I think your pupil gets a grade of A plus. And you get high marks as teacher equally as I, as you watch this piece, what stood out for you? 

01:35:25
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well I just love the fact that he now has a choice where as previously he felt like he didn't have a choice. To me that's the important goal in all of this is to add choices to peoples' lives, that's the goal. 

01:35:35
JON CARLSON He seemed to, this idea of just picking a few minutes to relax, just seemed to be insight. 

01:35:45
MICHAEL D. YAPKO Well certainly the relaxation itself is valuable. But it's beyond the relaxation and the ability for him to develop a whole new way of thinking about himself and his experience, and, and be willing to, to even run in his thinking about different ways he might start to apply these things. That to me is the real message, that this was successful. 

01:36:10
DIANE JIOS I think the nonverbal was probably as strong as the verbal, too. Where there was a change in, I noticed even his lips and the way he held his face seemed to be somewhat different. There was just a, a real physical change, you know. Yeah, yeah, he kind of bounced and you know he kind of bounced out of here, too, when he left. It was, uh, interesting. 

01:36:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO He was all smiles and nods on the way out, wasn't he? Which was nice. 

01:36:35
JON CARLSON You know we've seen the change in the therapist too, did you notice that? 

01:36:40
DIANE JIOS I noticed that too, a bit, yes. 

01:36:40
MICHAEL D. YAPKO There, there is a certain relaxation that goes along with finishing those, but uh, quite nice. 

01:36:45
JON CARLSON Uh, we have just a couple of minutes left. Are there any final comments that you might wanna give the viewer on this whole process, this whole interview that you just went through with Mike? 

01:37:00
MICHAEL D. YAPKO I certainly think that it illustrates the value of hypnosis, that here is a first session, only session, intervention. And I think a lotta people think that you have to have a great deal of information about the client, and a great deal of history, and a great deal of report with the client, before you can introduce hypnosis as a possibility, and I would suggest, of course, that you can use hypnosis as a report builder, you can use hypnosis as a diagnostic tool as well as a therapeutic tool. Diagnostically, there's information becoming available to me about how he thinks, how he feels, how he responds how he organizes information. And therapeutically of course, to be able to communicate some very specific messages, teach very specific skills to him, and then have him learn those skills, really the, the, uh, value of hypnosis, I think, as reaffirmed in a case like this. But it is also based on some very sound principles, in a way I'm doing cognitive therapy with him, of teaching how to make some very important fine cognitive distinctions, between when he should listen and when he shouldn't listen. But I'm doing that kind of cognitive intervention with a hypnotic twist, I think it brings it more to life, makes it more experientially powerful. And if we ask how to people learn best, it's through their own direct experience. 

01:38:20
DIANE JIOS One of the-, you kinda, what, touched on this lightly earlier, but I saw you work with some other clients also, and you didn't use hypnosis with them, why did you decide to use hypnosis with him. What gave you the- 

01:38:30
MICHAEL D. YAPKO There are some people who come into therapy specifically looking for support, and then there are other people who come into therapy looking for direction. And one of the ways that I have to make an assessment about how I'm going to intervene, particularly in a first session, is, is this person looking more for support, or for direction? Uh, I think that Mike was very clear in saying, that he felt stuck, his phrase was stuck in a gutter, and when people are feeling stuck, and they don't really know where to go, or what to do to merely offer support at that point is simply supporting confusion. So he was receptive to, and very focused on me and what I might say that might help him alleviate that sense of being stuck, and the other clients that you saw me work with, I think were much more interested in comin' in and tellin' me how bad things were, but when I would offer little bits of direction, they weren't particularly interested in hearing it. Uh, they weren't particularly interested in picking those ideas up and running with them, at least not yet. Now here's the difference in clients sense of timing. There are some people that they wanna come in, they wanna tell you their story. Mike could have cut me off in a second and said wait a second, I haven't told you about all the ways that my dad brutalized me. In which case I would have had to back off, and suspend even thinking about doing hypnosis, and go with his desire to tell his story. But in Mike's case, he was very receptive to me moving very quickly to in essence say to him, okay I've got it, your past is nasty, and you want that to change. And he's like, yes. But uh, the other people that you saw me work with, when I started to offer some direction, they were not responsive to it. They, they wanted to continue with telling me their story. So I have to follow their cues. Now would I wanna sit back and listen to their story every session, and not provide direction? Absolutely not, but I do have to work with each individual's sense of timing. 

01:40:35
