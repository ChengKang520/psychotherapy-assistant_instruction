The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM The Evolution of Psychotherapy A New Science of Love: A New Era for Couple Intervention Dr. Sue Johnson Los Angeles - December 2013 

00:00:00
DR. SUE JOHNSON Hi Everybody. I'm Sue Johnson and this is a talk on, uhm, a new science love and an new era for couple intervention. I'm associating with something called EFT, Emotionally Focused Therapy. Uhm, my son calls it Extremely Funny Therapy. If you came here for Emotional Freedom Technique, you're in the wrong place. So, uhm, I'm gonna talk to you just for a short time, uhm, and it's a short time for what I think is an enormous topic because what I'm gonna talk to you about is that we are going through a quiet revolution and that from my point of view, something is happening in our field that has never happened before. And some of it is perhaps because of conferences like this, because for a real new paradigm to happen and a real revolution to happen people need to talk to each other. And at this kind of conference, this is actually a place where therapists and social scientists and developmental psychologists and neuroscientists all start to talk to each other. And I think what I'm going to talk to you about today couldn't have happened without that kind of dialogue. So these kinds of meetings where we all, uhm, come together and share. Uhm, our different perspectives, I think, are incredibly important. So I'm gonna just kinda set, ah, a kind of context for you by, uhm, saying that we live at a fascinating time in human history, ah, and many of us live longer. We have better health and with infinitely more resources open to us than any other time in human history. At the same time, it seems to me and to other people, other social scientists that we are nonchalantly dismantling the social scaffolding that has allowed us to come this far. We are dismantling the tribe, the village, the community. Robert Putnam and his book Bowling Along suggest that we're allowing our social capital a web of supportive relationships to just slip away from us. In western societies, people report being lonelier and lonelier and about one quarter of the population in North America report that they have no one to confide in at all. This loss of human connection, it seems to me, is an obvious key factor in the epidemic of anxiety and depression that is now apparent in western societies. One in five American adults takes at least one drug daily for anxiety or depression and these anxiety disorder rates in Europe are between 10 and 20% of the population. We were also in the midst of three unprecedented social experiments. First of all, more and more of us are literally living alone. Nearly 30 million folks in the US live alone and most western countries show at least 25, ah, 28 to 30% up to 34% in the UK of households consist of one single person. Second, second thing that's happening that is unprecedented in the history of our species, is that we are rating more and more through technology. Spending our day talking to a screen in sound bites rather looking in another human face. To the point where John Cacioppo in his book on loneliness suggest that real social encounters have now been downgraded from an essential to an incidental, uhm, and the conversation itself is a dying art. For those of you who know me a little bit, uhm, I think my perspective of this is also, uhm, formed by the fact that I grew up in an English pub. And there was never a moment in my day when I wasn't surrounded by any number of interactions, social interactions. It was just the way life was, you know. So sometimes for me, I encounter these profound silences that may be in restaurants. I look at, uhm, couples on dates, uhm, looking at their cellphones, not even looking at each other and for me, that strikes me as bizarre and strange because of the, the context I grew up in. So our culture seems to also promote a myopic focus on the individual. We constantly get the message from all the glossy magazines that our main task is to love ourselves. If we love ourselves, this will cure us of all the ills that plague us and a well functioning adult is one who is able to regulate his or her emotions without reference to others. A social psychologist Jean Twenge suggests, "This culture rains enough narcissism to get everybody wet." In the midst of this movement away from community, living alone and reliance on technology, there is a third huge social experiment which I think sometimes we don't see because we live in the world and everything-- what is just looks like the norm. What we need to remember when we treat couples, I think, is that It's only in the last 40 years as women have become more financially independent and able to control their fertility, that we marry and stay and le-- or leave our marriages on the basis of something apparently nebulous and indefinable. What has been called a mysterious mixture of sex and sentiment: Romantic love. On the late fif-- 1950s, women rating, requirements for marriage rated love in fifth place. Now, survey suggest that for most women, a man being able to talk about his feelings is more important than his prowess as a provider. Quite interesting. Marriage has shifted from an economic to an emotional enterprise. Ah, just to give you a feel for that, in my, my life I remember when I was 21 years old going out to visit my aunt. All my relatives owned pubs as well so, you know, she owned her own pub and I went to visit my aunt and she said, "Susan, you're 21 and you don't have a man on your arm." And, ah, that partly this was very, you know, disastrous and I say, well how should I chose him auntie? She-- I'm not sure but, uhm, just make sure that he has a suit. What did she say? She say make sure he can care of you financially. If he has a suit, he's middle class, he's got a job right. The most foundational unit of our society. The human family now rests solely and squarely on the quality of affection between partners. As sociologist like Stephanie Coonts know them. In this sense we are all pioneers in uncharted territory. Our romantic love relationships have become our main source of social support connection and intimacy in a more modest disconnected world. We count on the ties of romantic love in a way that no civilization have, ah, has ever done before. All these experiments, they sort of make you sound kind of like, ah, no we're on thin ice here except, this is a very optimistic talk I'm gonna give you today because what I wanna say is all this is happening at the very same time as we are going through a revolution in the science of close relationships. We are finding grasping a vital close relationship with others is for our health and happiness, our mental and physical balance. Secure attachment bonds are associated with every indicator of health and resilience that we know especially they provide us with safe havens that help us deal with the anxieties of life, stress and trauma. There seems to be a kind of buffer balance bounce effect that we get from being close to other people that we know we can count on. Felt connection with a loved one buffers us from fear and stress, helps us keep our emotional balance rather than numb out or become flooded and allows us to bounce back into resilience and flexible responsiveness. We need loving relationships the way we need oxygen. And many of us now rely on our mate to be our tribe, our family, our only web of connection and support. Given this context is not surprising that couple therapy help with your relationships is more and more in demand. No wonder 70% of all health professionals in North America say they work with couples. The need to understand and foster positive relationships is urgent and pers-- pervasive but the need is not just for interventions that turn down the, the volume on conflict or create insight into negative dynamics or foster negotiation skills. The need is for us as mental health professionals to be able to guide life partners into safe haven secure bonds. A sense of security with someone who will come when they're called, come when they're needed. A bond where they answer to the question, "Are you there for me?" is are you emotionally accessible and responsive to me is a resounding yes. In the 1990s the field of couple therapy was accused of ignoring nurturance and love and settling for addressing the surface symptoms of a relationship-- of relationship distress. One person said to me in a conference once, "It seems to me that the whole field of couple's therapy is like moving the chairs around on the deck of Titanic." Okay, I actually-- I think, uhm, in many ways this accusation was fair. After all, to help people find love and nurturance, we gotta be able to pin it down, you gotta be able to define it, know how to revoke it and shape it. The revolution of that is incurring is just that. That when we need it the most we finally have discovered a map to the terrain of romantic love. We know how to shape the accessibility and responsiveness that is the basis of a secure bond. Just to give you an example, I shared in another talk I went to the opera a few, uhm, weeks ago in, in Ottawa. I live in the capital of Canada and I went to, ah, Bizet's Carmen and Carmen comes out in first act and sort of, you know, pouts and flounces around and sort of seduces about 50 soldiers with one flutter of her eyelash. And as she's doing that she sings love is a gypsy child. A gypsy child that knows no law. And I had this ridiculous desire and go, "Excuse me, uhm, ah, excuse me. Ah, no, that's actually not true anymore. No! Wrong!" Okay, I don't think people would appreciate that but anyway we -- it seems to me that if you know the laws of love, we can heal relationships at the level of their core organizing elements. Not just in terms of symptoms We can then, not just heal relationships but create relationships that heal and grow people. Couple therapy has a double dip change impact. It changes the relationships and it changes the partners. It changes their ways of engaging with each other and if you do good therapy it seems to me you helped them create ways of engaging with each other that the-- where they grow each other and help them heal from past wound and hurts and face the world in a different way. Romantic love-- and I think this is actually one of the reasons if we stopped talking about sex for two seconds, uhm, I think this is one of the reasons why we are also caught up in and fascinated by it, we know on some level that romantic love is the second great opportunity offered in the scheme of human development for growth and expansion of self. Once we acknowledge what we're talking about here and how important relationships are it makes sense that partners are starting to be included as a support unit in therapy to address individual problems. David Barlow who is here at this conference finds that including the spouse in the behavioral intervention for anxiety, almost doubles effectiveness rates. A (inaudible ) -- and I'm not talking about doing couple therapy. They're just talking about including the spouse as a support for the person going through therapy. A (inaudible ) finds the same kinds of results when treating alcoholism. Therapist like me insist that leaving a partner out of the therapy envelope when we're treating PTSD in an individual is detrimental and squanders the healing power though the clients love relationship can provide. The natural ecological niche, the evolutionary context for people and the natural healing environment is other people especially those we depend on. Attachment theory and research on adult bonding and the new related of science of emotion offers us the first clear comprehensive scientific and eminently practical guide to love relationships. One that integrates self and system, individual development and relationship interaction. Maybe I'm all by myself here but it seems to me that this is amazingly significant. Know, if I sit in my kitchen and I read as I did not long ago, that physicist working with the Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland found evidence that one of the hidden links in our understanding of matter, they found evidence for something they called the Higgs boson. To me it sounds like a small dog anyway. The Higgs boson which apparently explains why particles have differing values of mass and the papers made a big deal about this. It seems to me to stand and say we have a new science of love and bonding which I like to call love sense is at least a significant as our, ah, in our understanding of the spec of matter called a human being as something like Higgs boson. After all, I don't stand in my kitchen everyday and say, "I wonder how to understand the mass and particles of matter." That doesn't really occur to me but we do all spend an awful lot of time thinking about our relationships and trying to figure them out. We are at last understanding one of the great mysteries which includes things like how could one brain tune in to another, read intentions and feeling another's feeling courtesy of mirror neurons. What is the brain chemistry that promotes grooming contact, comfort seeking and a monogamous bonding, the cuddle hold more oxytocin. How exactly do humans live best to use a Celtic saying in shelter of each other and goal for the couple of family therapist. How do we help people create bonds of love in the session and make those bonds last.

00:16:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON The fact that we can understand these things that 21st century couple therapy can be infinitely-- that, ah, more relevant and address the most urgent issues of our time and it seems to me that on a human level, the most urgent issue of our time is that emotional isolation is naturally traumatizing to human beings. On target, we can help people build more secure bonds and more scientifically based so that we don't have to follow cliché and platitude and old love stories and old ideas. We can actually turn and say, "What is happening here? How can we understand it? We can have a love map for-- a road map for loving connections based on science. This new science of love offers us the possibility of the warp speed lead into new levels of competence in our field it seems to me. What we're discovering is that love is an exquisitely wired in survival code with its own rhymes and reasons, not a fleeting moment of sexualized frustrated lust or a friendship. Love is about this and this is very brilliant. Uhm, I'm gonna show you a little clip from, uhm, from an English county council. So it's a little strange but I'm gonna show it to you. love, it seems to me, is all this. O-o-oh. Help. Ah.

00:19:40
DR. SUE JOHNSON Isn't that clever? None of us is designed to face the dangers of life without a seatbelt. A source of protection and care we all long for this which means that couple therapy taps into what I believe as the John Bowlby, the father of attachment theory in research. We tap in to the most powerful unconditioned motivating force known to man. Our need to connect and belong with another. If we can tap into and use this force in our sessions, we have the most amazing force for change in any therapy anywhere at any time. Not just out couples but with-- and if we know how to use this, this motivation we have the most amazing force to-- for change not just in couples but with individuals and with families. And if sometimes people say to me, "Why does have ti-- get, uhm, such, uhm, good results and why don't you have problems with relapse. And I'd love to be able to tell you that's because, well, I and all my colleagues are so amazingly clever but I don't believe that. What believe is it's because we found a way to tap into this amazing, ah, power of this motivation for human connection. People will take amazing risks, they will leap into the unknown. If you can help them speak that longing and stay with that longing and turn that longing into a way of reaching for their partner. To place all these in a practical frame, what can I and other EFT therapist who use the new science of love do that couple's therapist couldn't do 20 years ago? First, I approach the task as a relation-- a relationship consultant cuz that's what I am. An expert on the darts of love if you like, with a sense of efficacy. Little while ago in the New York Times, somebody suggested the being a couple's ther-- have you even noticed New York Times doesn't like couple's therapist? Anyway, uhm, why they go, uhm, so the New York times suggested that couple therapy was like piloting a helicopter through a tornado. I wanna tell you that that's not true. EFT is a, uhm, American airlines scheduled flight. We know where we're going, we know the route, we know the bombs on the way, we know what to do with turbulence, we know how one gets there, right. So the point is I expect to be successful when I work with a couple. That gives me a safe haven secure base. That gives me a place stand in therapy and that is really communicated to the couple. (inaudible ) a little while ago put long term and newly infatuated lovers in a brain scan machine and they showed that about 40% of long term lover's brains lit up in just the same way as the brains of newly intoxicated lovers. The conclusion-- and I thought it was very gutsy of them, they said, "The conclusion is that love could last in which case we would like to suggest to clinicians that they expect more out of themselves and their interventions and they learn exactly how to create this loving connection." What I want to say to (inaudible ) is we did it already. In 16 outcome studies of EFT, we have routinely impacted variables like intimacy, trust, forgiveness of injuries, relationships satisfaction and the anxiety and depression that is the natural effect of emotional starvation in a relationship. And also-- and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit later about this, we have recently shown that we can impact the attachment security between the couple, the quality of the emotional bond between the couple and the responses that go with that. Responses like being able to reach for another person when vulnerable and being able to respond to another person's emotional needs. Secondly, what's different I think from 20 years ago is that I know how to go to the heart of the matter fast. Task relevance is the aspect of the therapeutic alliance that predicts success in EFT. That translates into the couples saying yes, you're on the money in this therapy. This is exactly what we need to talk about. It's the level of emotional engagement in therapy and this comes out in psychotherapy research, not j-- in general. Not just with us. It's the level of emotional engagement in therapy that predicts outcome much better than how distressed you are when you come into therapy or even what sort of intervention you do. EFT is a short term therapy. Its 10 to 20 sessions and it happens in three stages. De-escalation, restructuring the bond and consolidation. We help clients move towards safe bonding interactions that offer them a safe haven to go to and a secure base of support to go out into and explore the world. Weak-- uhm, what does that mean? What does it look like. Well, it means that at the end of the first stage, uhm, couples will say, "Hey, we were able to tell each other the other morning we're caught in that thing again! That cycle, that spiral." 

00:25:05
EFT Stages of Change De-escalation of dialogue evoking attachment fears Restructuring emotional accessibility and responsiveness Consolidation — articulating new cognitive models, stories, patterns 

00:25:05
DR. SUE JOHNSON And so I said to him, I said, "Well then this must be one of these times when you're starting to feel like a failure. I'm not really telling you you're a failure. I'm just sort of getting upset but this-- but I a starting to feel alone and that's what happens in a spiral isn't it?" "Let's stop. You want some tea?" So what they've just done there is they've stepped out of a dance that has wrung their relationship for the last 30 years. What does restructuring emotion accessibility and responsive-- looks, look like. At the end of stage two, somebody could say, "I am too scared to tell you how much I depend on you. How afraid I am that you don't wanna hear that, that you'll turn away. So I get mad and critical to try and hold you beside me but what I need is your reassurance that I'm your special one." Consolidation, what does that look like? It looks like articulating new models and stories and patterns so people can say, "We can be a team now. We can help each other with our fears and I don't want you to hurt. I never want you to hurt. The story of us is gonna be about how we lose our balance, clutch with each other or push each other away, but then we can turn back and reach for each other and that's a whole new kind of love story." And that's what John Gottman talks about I think when he's talking about the fact that master couples, they still fight, they still get stuck in disconnection but they can repair it. To change habitual disconnection into secure bonding we have to plug into the channel called emotional attachment and then we'd basically have to do what we call the five steps of EFT. Let me-- and I dance tango and if you know that, so it's called the tango. 

00:26:50
THE 5 Basic Moves of EFT Repeat these 5 moves again and again, as you move through the steps and stages of EFT Dancing the EFT Tango 

00:26:50
DR. SUE JOHNSON Okay, I'm obsessed with tango. Uhm, I'm obsessed with interac-- interactional dances, right. So, uhm, so what are the five basic steps of EFT and you would see an EFT therapist doing this all the time, all the time. We reflect process. We reflect what is happening here. You raised your voice and pointed and said to him, "You're just-- you've never felt an emotion in your life, you're a terrible partner." And as she did this you turned away and looked out the window and sighed and said, "I'm not gonna talk to you anymore." Is that what happens in this relationship? You push, you push and you tell him how unhappy you are and I guess that's hard for you to hear. You just try to turn it off and shut down and turn away. Unfortunately when you do that you shut her out and then you go into what's happening for you as you listen to her voice. The man says, "There's no point in talking to her, it's hopeless, it's hopeless. So I do. I shut down, I go away and I walk into the hopelessness with him." So in the next step, what we do when we reflect the process, we go into the dance and stay in it and slow it down and look at it and take it apart. We explore deeper a more primary emotions like his sense of helplessness and hopelessness. When we feel help isn't hopeless and we're in danger, it is a very usual thing to just go very, very, very, very still. Yeah, it's kind of naturally encoded in our brain to do that. And then we don't put out any signals to our partner and they feel alone. So we deepen and clarify and expand emotion and as the emotion changes and he starts to talk about his hopelessness instead of how he doesn't wanna talk and how he doesn't really feel anything in this relationship anymore. As he starts to talk about his hopelessness, we help him stay with that and we help him turn that new experience into a new signal to his partner. He starts to play a different emotional music that encourages a whole new different kind of dance. So we create an enactment. We say, "Could you turn and tell her please, could you turn and tell her please. I do turn away because I just feel so hopeless here. I've already failed before I even say anything." So we create an enactment and we support him to do that. So you get a new response happening in the relationship and then what do we do? We process the enactment. We say, "What was it like for you to say that?" He says, "It's scary. I don't usually talk like this." We say to her, what was it like to hear him? She says, "Well, actually it's a relief because I though he wasn't feeling anything. I had no idea he felt hopeless and helpless." And then we tie a bow on it. What we try to do in the FTE is create constant experiences of being able to order your experience, makes sense of it, create new signals and feel confident. Because after all, we focus on love as something that's all about helplessness. We fall into it, we fall out of it. It just hits us in the head, right? No, we do it. We just haven't understood that. So what we say to our couples is, "Look what you just did! You came in here a minute ago and said that you just don't know how to do this but look what you just did! You went into your emotions that you don't like to enact, it's unfamiliar. You, you found your hopelessness and helplessness. You turned and shared it with your partner. That's amazing that you have the courage to do that." And you're angry with him but you listen to him and you said, "Oh, I don't want you to feel helpless and hopeless." And he goes, "This is incredible. This is what really long term successful lovers do. They can turn and listen to each other. They can, you know, put the noise aside, of, maybe feeling not so safe with each other. Look what you just did. So you get-- give them a sense of confidence that they can try to-- they can create these new positive interactions. All these starts with plugging in to the attachment channel where this conflict between disconnection and connection occurs, which is interpreted by a mammalian brain as a life and death struggle. because literally when we are born, there is some part of us that knows perfectly well if we call and nobody comes, we die. That is true and that is when our brain is being constructed that we formulate things like that. We focus on emotion, how it's constructed and processed and experienced and expressed between partners. We change the music of the dance. Emotion is the music of the jo-- dance. What's the quickest way to change a dance change the emotion. What do I mean by the attachment channel? So, I'm gonna tell you a story because enough with all these abstract concepts. I'm gonna tell you a story of one of my couples that I just seen cuz I want you to hear that you have to be listening for this because couples don't talk to you about attachment. They tell you these kinds of stories and you can miss it. So, this story is called The Train station. Robert is a very sophisticated mental health professional and he has a very depressed wife. And the wife is Mary-- is referred by the therapist who diagnoses the problem as is often the case by individual therapist diagnosing a couple of problems who diagnoses the problem as Mary is depressed cuz her husband is a narcissistic, demanding creep. The husband seems reasonable and concerned about his wife. He says he loves her and their problems are very puzzling. The wife is confused and quiet and teary and turns away from her partner and they talk endlessly about their small arguments especially about how much exercise is enough. He is an obsessive exerciser and he offers her constant advice on how much she should exercise. And then they start talking about how they have no intimacy and they fallen out of love and it's impossible to bridge this relationship. Mary sighs and says very quietly that after 25, maybe it's just time to quit. When I asked when the distance started, he tells me in a very rational calm way that the distance started three years ago when Mary went to care for her dying sister and stayed away for three months. And of course he understood perfectly that she had to stay away to care for ther dying sister for three months. So you get it. Ah, but he, his rational mind says that was fine and during that time her wrote her a letter outlining that if she didn't come home immediately, her health would decline. And that she was weak and having no back bone to take care of herself. Mary says, "Ah, no, uhm, that wasn't when it started." Uhm, she had withdrawn from that point but she tells me about a pivotal moment that changes the nature of the relationship. And if you have an understanding of love relationships you see the pivotal moment when a relationship shifts from, uhm, maybe some disconnection but enough connection to keep everybody from starving into chronic disconnection conflict and hopelessness. Mary says it was on the train station in France. They've gone for a hike and she'd skin her knee and Robert had told her that that would not have happened if she had gone to the gym often. Okay, so he's the critical, complaining pursuer. Everyone got that right, okay. So Mary, standing on the station, she has coffee in her hand and she's pulling their little suitcase when Robert suddenly realizes that the train is moving. "We're gonna miss the train." He's very fit so he sprinted, he leaps on the train. All right, and he turns, he yells at the conductor, "Stop the train! Stop the train!" And he turns to Mary and he yells, "Run!" Well, Mary is like, "What? Ah, I didn't know tra-- ahaha." Right, she's standing there frozen and what Robert says is, "She just stood there. I was screaming at her and she just stood there! She was frozen! She didn't try, she didn't move." Listen to his voice. Finally, she runs, she puts herself on the train, she gets on the train, she drops her coffee, climbs on the train and Robert screams at her, "Why are you so god damn slow?" And she says, "I shut down then. I went silent. I felt so small and I knew that I could never please this man cuz I am slow. I'm not as fast as he. I'll never be as fast as him and all he does is give me advice and say he's frustrated with me and I do, I slow him down. And so, there's nothing I can do." So an EFT therapist will go right into that story because you hear the attachment in it. The EFT therapist I go in to what happened to him and how he processed it because if you ask him he says, "Well, you know, I was just trying to tell her on the train. I don't know-- all the fuss is about. I don't know why we keep talking about this incident." So I say to him, "Could you help me Robert? You're on the train. Can you feel it? You're on the train. What are you holding on to? Is it metal? Good. And you're looking back onto the station. What do you see? Tell me what you see." And it takes a while to focus him down, I have to slow him down but he says, "She isn't moving." Which is just what he says in the relationship. She freezes up, she isn't trying and I say, "What happens to your body as you say this?" He says, "Well, I don't know why but I, I feel this weight in my chest and I can't breathe and I don't wanna talk about this. There's something weird here. It's almost like it's scary but why would it be scary." And I say, "Could you help me if you just stay with that scariness. What's happening to you, what do you see?" I'm going for the trigger. He says, "Well, I'm on the train. I'm going this way. I'm on the train and she's, she's not moving." I say, "Could you help me? She's on the train. She's not reaching for you." He says, "Yes! I have to take care of everything! I had to take care of everybody. I took care of my parents when I was a kid and now, you know, that's all fine. I can do that but she doesn't try. She just stands still and I say, 'And you're on the train all by your...'" And he says "Self. I'm all by myself." And then he starts to cry and he says, "There's no one who ever takes care of me and I can't count on anyone can I?" And then he starts to cry some more. The story of distress is always about disconnection. The distorted messages of criticism and demandingness are always about primal panic. Jaak Panksepp who's a brain researcher says that all mammals have a special neural pathway in their brain that is reserved for the panic that happens when we turn around and find ourselves alone in the universe and we don't have anyone with us. This story which I helped this couple make coherent is all about are you there for me and it is every distressed relationship story. I tune in to the attachment channel and then this couple's distress is not puzzling at all. The other thing we need to understand is this partner's pain is real. Eisenberger has shown in brain scans that emotional rejection and abandonment even in casual relationships is processed in the same part of the brain and the same way as physical pain. Both are danger cues related to survival. Hooley who looked-- Jill Hooley who looks at brain scan says that criticism from an attachment figure delivers low grade punches to the brain. I see Robert stuck in his desperation. His attachment anxiety and trying to control his partner's responses which drives her away and I see that rejection is depressing. Mary here, she's not enough and she sees his desperation and his need for her. She literally grows taller in my office and as she tells him later, "I'm different from you. I'm not as fast as you are, I'm not as strong but I can take care of you. I always have but in my way. I don't wanna go hiking all the time but I'm there and if you stop pushing me away we can be together. I need you too." As their relation, shifts into connection she moves out of despair. If you want to see this, I might show it on Wednesday, in a very clear form, you can watch a beautiful YouTube by Ed Tronick called Still Face. With that two minute YouTube with a mother and baby going through these motions of the mother stopping responding and the baby screaming and getting desperate, trying to engage the mother. And then when the mother still doesn't respond, the baby turns away and shuts down. When there's not response, the baby goes into melt down. Those responses are wired into our brain. They're what you see in your office with a distressed couple. We can grasp how these attachment emotions operate in the music of a love dance and we can help couples regulate them and then help them create adults that confirm that they can be close and disconfirm their we-- worst fears and most negative steps. The new science also tells me that just naming emotions calms the amygdala, the emotional brain and fires up the prefrontal cortex so the emotion regulation can, can begin to take over. Uhm, just as Mary starts to feel safer with Robert in therapy and he's able to ask from a position of vulnerability when he's able to ask for his needs in a soft way than she naturally moves into caring compassion. And from a point of view of people like France Duval(ph), what he talks about is this is a natural process. You have to look at how people trigger it an cue it but it's a natural part of the neural architecture of loving, I don't have to teach compassion skills or empathy skills. I have to change the music in the relationship so that her partner knows how to evoke that sense of connection. I don't have to teach her listening skills or cope up, coach her in compassionate responding. All these means you have to work with emotion. You have to work with emotion and if guys have heard me, ah, talk before, you know, we can talk about the power of emotion and how there are basic-- six basic emotions and I'm not gonna talk to you about the power of emotion. I'm just gonna show it to you.

DR. SUE JOHNSON Robert Peraza pauses at his son's name on the 9/11 Memorial during the tenth anniversary ceremonies at the site of the World Trade Center. Phyllis Siegel, 76, left, and Connie Kopelov, 84, both of New York, embrace after becoming the first same sex couple to get married at the Manhattan City Clerk's office in 2011. Terri Gurrola is reunited with her daughter after serving in Iraq for 7 months. I just shown you pictures of grief and joy, bittersweet relief, vulnerability. You not only got the message, you felt it in your own body courtesy of your mirror neurons and if you were paying attention, it moved you. No truth or message matters until it moves you. Emotion comes from the Latin ēmovēre, to move. I imperfectly reflect, validate and normalize client's emotions so they could use me a sec-- a secure base, explore their emotional worlds and then actively shape them. I try to create each session as what Fritz call-- Fritz Perls called a safe adventure. Actually I think he called it a save emergency but I prefer safe adventure so I'm gonna change Fritz Perls if you don't mind. Where people are in touch with but not flooded with emotion, they're able to take a working distance from their emotion and reshape it. And if you're on target with emotion, you know that there are six basic core emotions and this is Paul Ekman's work and he is here and I was honored to meet him. There are six basic emotions that move us in a particular direction, uhm, that you're gonna see in your sessions with couples. And these emotions I can evoke, I can evoke the fe-- fear to motivate reaching for comfort. I can evoke anger, to prompt assertiveness in and timid withdrawer. I can evoke sadness to cut through numbing or loving compassion in one part, let it cut through shame and another. Shame is perhaps the most difficult emotion to work with. I suggest to my students that a really good therapist has a small 20 watt lightbulb to shine down into a plant's bit of shade. The other partners caring and acceptance is a stadium floodlight. It makes sense to turn it on, it changes the whole landscape. This is an example of my colleague, Jim cone talks about when he says the most efficient and functional affect regulation is not social, is not self but social regulation. We are wired to turn to other people as a resource and to use them to regulate our emotions. Science tells us this is the work of James Gross. That the suppression of emotion is very hard work. It's easily exhausted. It's just takes too much glucose. This tells me, like this science translates for me into every session. So this tells me for example that when we are working intensely with couples and they begin to block us, and they say I don't feel anything, all we have to do is stay in the emotional territory and present emotional cues again ore reflect the body feelings that arise. The-- you can't keep suppressing. It's just too much work. You just-- if you just stay there, couples will come into their affect. We then help couples order these feelings into coherent attachment stories. Expressions of need, we help them turn them into what we call hold me tight conversations where each person can express their fear ask for their needs to be met in a way that pulls the other person towards them. In nine studies that we have done from our 16 outcomes studies, we find that if you can have a hold-me-tight conversation and we could see it, encode it on tape, you will be out of distress at the end of therapy and you-- and our follow up results will tell you that you're held on to the gains that you've made in therapy. So it p-- it really predicts a lot. What would Robert and Mary's attachment hold, hold-me-tight conversation look like. 

00:46:35
MOVING INTO A HOLD ME TIGHT CONVERSATION Mary: I have shut you out — I can't stand to hear how I must be stronger — never down .... or I will disappoint you. I have all kinds of strength and want to be there for you. But you can't get pushy — make like I am flawed everytime you get scared. I want to come close and I want you to accept me and trust me — I can be there for you but I need to feel safe. Robert: Well — I do accept you — well — I guess maybe I get freaked out if you show frailty — I spent so long taking care of my mom — of everyone. It's hard for me to tune into my own feelings here — I guess I get scared — terrified really — I don't mean to push you — to make you feel flawed. (tears) The idea of you giving up and getting overwhelmed — not trying to reach me — I feel so small then. I guess I want your reassurance — I am so scared of losing you — and it's hard to tell you — this cold aloneness is always waiting for me (She reaches for his hand) 

00:46:35
DR. SUE JOHNSON Mary says, "I've shut you out. I can't stand to hear how I must be stronger, never down .... or I will disappoint you. But I have all kinds of strength and wanna be there for you. But you can't get pushy, make like I am flawed everytime you get scared. I wanna come close and I want you to accept me and trust me. I can be there for you but I need to feel safe. And Robert says, "Well, I do accept you. Well, well, I guess I get freaked out if you show frailty. I spent so long taking care of my mom and of everyone. It's really hard for me to tune into my own feelings here but I guess I get scared. Well, well I, well I, well I get terrified really. I mean, I don't mean to push you and make you feel flawed. And he tears. The idea of you giving up and getting overwhelmed, not trying to reach me. I feel so small then. I guess I want your reassurance. I'm so scared of losing you and it's really hard to tell you this but this cold aloneness is always waiting for me. He grew up very alone, this man. She reaches for his hand. So in nine studies we have looked to this whole hold-me-tight conversations and I'm gonna suggest you their examples of what John Bowlby all those years ago called effective dependency. Every person-- each person in the relationship in turn could tune in to their attachment needs and fear, keep their balance and express clearly what they need to their partner in a way that invites connection. The other person can then tune in and respond and there's a positive cycle of bonding that begins, that creates incredibly resilient connection between the couple. By the way, emotion really is powerful. It has control precedents so the other thing that happens in these conversations is that it induces intoxicating in even the most jaded and exhausted therapist. At my clinic, sometimes people come out from session go, "Yes!" And I know without even asking them that they've just had a-- they co-- they come out of a hold-me-tight conversation. Couple therapy is becoming more and more relevant, more and more on target, more and more effective and efficient now that we understand love. This science is gonna change the arena of relationship interventions and just to give you a feel about this and I wasn't gonna talk to anybody about it until this talk but I broke down and talked to him. In another one of my talks so I'm gonna tell you again. Just give you a feel about this. I'm gonna tell you about our latest study. One part of the study is that we want you to show that we could, could create secure bonding, uhm, in EFT sessions. You know, when you're doing research you just sort of write this out. it looks all-- it's on a page and it sounds perfectly logical and then I went home one night and on the way home I thought, "Wait a minute! We've just written a research grant. We, we just written a research basically saying that we can create the most basic elements of love in our sessions. That's really weird. I wonder if we can do that. I'm not sure we can." But so, then, of course I got all up tight but basically what we found was we found that yes, we could shift people from anxious attachment, we are always pushing for reassurance and you never showed your love and we could shift people who were avoiding an attachment and said I don't need people, I believe in needing people. I'm just fine and who shut down and numb out. What is interesting is they change differently. They both change into being all secure in their attachment are able to reach and feel connected to their partner and respond to their partner but the anxious folks didn't really shift their sense of security in the bond until stage two of EFT where we had these incredible hold-me-tight conversations and they could speak their needs and they saw their partner actively walking towards them and responding to them. The avoiding folks, the folks that started with I don't really need anybody, they changed a little bit in each session. Which is important to us because sometimes those folks don't look like they're changing at all. But from my point of view, the most exciting thing we did in this study is that we put the women, please don't ask me why me why we didn't put the men at all. It was cause we didn't have the money okay. I always hate admitting that but it's true we didn't have the money okay. So If you want, you can give me a couple of million dollars and I'll do it again and I'll put the men in as well all right. We put women in FMRI machine before therapy in three conditions. A loan in the machine, holding the hand of a male stranger, and holding their partners' hand. And in these conditions we told them that when they saw an X come up in front of their face, they're in a machine, their head is in a cage, they can't move. When they say and X in front of their face, there was a 20% chance they're gonna be shocked on their ankles and my graduate students assured me that the shock hurt. I don't have to go in the machine. Poor old graduate students, they have to do that sort of stuff. So before EFT, when they're alone in the machine, the women's brains lit up like Christmas trees when they saw the X and every part of the shock really hurts. And it was the same when holding the stranger's hand and it was the same when holding your husband's hand. The husband's hand had no effect. It was not the safety cue, it did not mitigate the fear and the threat of shock. However, after EFT, the alone condition and the stranger condition were more or less the same but this time, after these hold-me-tight conversations, when the women saw the X and their husband held their hand, nothing happened in their brain.

Changing Responsiveness to Threat with EFT Pre-Therapy Partner Handholding-Post Therapy Partner Handholding 

00:52:55
DR. SUE JOHNSON This side is pre-therapy. Look at the brain lighting up at the threat of shock. The other side is the partner holding their hand after therapy and I called out Jim Cone who is the Neuroscientist I did this with and said, "What do that blue bits mean?" And he said, "It means they're not dead." This is interesting but what is really interesting, there's lots of levels, this is interesting. What is really interesting is that it's not just the handholding after therapy, change the sensitivity to the amygdala to threat. Please notice the prefrontal cortex is not lighting up either. What this means is the husband hand was-- the husband hand holding wasn't helping her control her fear or regulate her fear. It was changing her perception of threat at source as it was encoded and by the way, she also said that when her husband was holding her hand, when shock did happen, it was merely uncomfortable. This is very, very fascinating and it's what John Bowlby who first wrote about attachment and bonding all those years ago. It's what he said. He said when you have a loved one who you can count on, who will come where you call, who you feel loved and valued by. It makes the world a safer place. It literally downgrades your sense of threat in the world so you don't have to live work, your life being vigilant. You have a safe haven secure base from which to live your life. All right, this is affect regulation at its earliest and most effective. This supports all the ideas behind attachment theory and bonding and attachment research and it also supports the power of what we do in EFT; to help people move into a safer world. A different way of regulating their emotion and connections that are incredibly powerful can even change the way their brain processes fear. This kind of research, uhm, is just one piece of a whole new slew of research from all different parts of social sciences and I guess what I wanna say is all these research is singing the same song. It's all telling us and it's all telling us things that we as couples therapist and family therapist can use, uhm, in our interventions. Next experiment I wanna do is find out whether we turn on oxytocin in out hold-me-tight conversations. I would bet we do but we need to find out more. There's so much more to learn here. As we learn more and more about how relationships work and how truly relational we are as human beings, relationship education and couple interventions I hope will become more and more integrated in our health care systems. But this is not the only role I think for those of us who study in shape relationships. Attachment researchers, developmental experts, clinicians, neuroscientist who study social connection. Must I believe at those beacons testifying, testifying to the power and value of human connection. John Bowlby changed the culture of parenthood. If you go into a hospital now and you are allowed to stay by your child's bed and hold your child's hand, that is because of John Bowlby. Because it's not so long ago that you were not allowed in the hospital because you were a source of germs and the fact that your child got up set when they left you, that was just inconvenient. When you think about how parenting and our image of children has changed in the last 40 years. That is the result of the attachment and bonding research. We see children differently and we treat them differently than when Bowlby first did his work. It seems to me that we've now got to go to another change in the culture of adult intimate relationships. Unless we're willing to accept a society that has nothing to do with our most basic desire specifications, we are bonding mammals. Our job in the 21st century as mental health professionals is to foster a new positive culture of adult bonding. Aristotle noted what is honored will be cultivated. In the 1930s, when a reporter asked Mahatma Ghandi, what he thought of western civilization, he replied, "I think it would be a good idea." Understanding the power of love relationships and how to shape them bids us honor, our needs for secure bonds and cultivate our relation in nature to create a truly human civilization. Thank you
