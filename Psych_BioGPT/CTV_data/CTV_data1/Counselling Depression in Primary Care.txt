Videlicet DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY THE UNIVERSITY of MANCHESTER Counselling Depression in Primary Care Linda Gask Jan Scott Sally Standart 

00:00:00
LINDA GASK  This videotape deals with behavioral and cognitive approaches to the Counseling of Depression in Primary Care. It's important to say at this point that the skills and strategies that we'll be demonstrating are not necessarily alternatives to drug treatment, but can be very effectively used in combination. We're going to look at the importance of negotiating with the patient, collaborating with them and helping them to work out solutions to their problems themselves. It's important to try and avoid giving them helpful advice, but instead to adopt the questioning stance and therefore help the patient to find their own solutions. 

00:00:50
Agree on what the problem is Agree on how it is to be tackled Decide "can I manage alone?" Negotiate referral if needed Don't take on too much Counseling strategies Self, world, other worries of depressive quality 

00:00:50
LINDA GASK Before you can decide whether you and the patient can work together, you have to come to an agreement about what the problem is and how to tackle it. You have to decide whether you can manage the patient or whether you have to refer on to another professional. If you can't agree, you may have to spend some time working on negotiation. Referral itself has to be negotiated and it's important to say at this point. Don't take on more than you can confidently handle. We are going to look at two particular groups of strategies. Behavioural, which include problem solving, coping strategies and the planning of activities and Cognitive, which includes the eliciting of automatic thoughts and then intervening with automatic thoughts. Patients essentially present us with their Worries and concerns. These can be "Realistic" worries, actual losses, for instance loss of a job or loss of health. But these are essentially soluble, then Problem solving approach can be used. It may basically insoluble, for instance coming to terms with a loss of a loved-one, then Coping strategies have to be used. "Unrealistic" worries or worries about the self, the world or other things which are essentially depressive in quality. For these types of worries, Cognitive strategies can be effective. 

00:02:15
Problem solving Agree on problem to be tackled Brainstorm possible solutions Explore pros and cons of options Agree on goal or target Work out steps needed Stress inoculation 

00:02:15
LINDA GASK  Problem solving can be very useful for interpersonal or practical problems where a decision needs to be made on how to resolve the problem. Problem solving has several stages, these may seem rather mechanical but both you and the patient can find the structure extremely helpful and make it more easily learned. First of all, you have to agree on the problems to be tackled. The next stage is to then brainstorm possible solutions to the problem. Then go through and explore the pros and cons of each alternative and then agree on a goal or target. Then you have to work out with the patient, the steps necessary to achieve this goal. Finally, we'll be looking at the concept of stress inoculation which is basically looking at the worst case scenario and how you gonna deal with it. You need to check out with the patient how they would like things to be different in the future, so you can set a specific aim and know when you've reached it. This patient has a problem with the care of her mother. Her sister is angry because she's not able to visit on weekdays and only on weekends. She can't visit during the week because of increased pressure of work. She's a teacher who's been trying to implement a new curriculum. There's been increasing conflict between herself and her sister because of this. 

00:03:40
  Um, you're telling me that, um, that you're already visiting your mother on weekends... (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:03:50
 ...and your sister visits her during the week. 

00:03:50
  Yeah. 

00:03:55
 But, that you feel that as a good daughter, you should in fact be doing more for your mother than you're already are. 

00:04:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:04:00
  And that your sister that is putting some pressure on you to do this. 

00:04:05
 Yeah. 

00:04:05
  Is that a fair summary? 

00:04:10
 I think it is, yeah. 

00:04:10
 Right. 

00:04:10
 I mean, I'm, I'm actually closer, you know, I live closer than my sister really, so, I do feel like I should be, you know, sort of helping out during the week, really. 

00:04:20
  So, you really feel that there's some pressure that you should be doing more. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:04:25
Consider options 

00:04:25
 Right. What do you see is possible options for dealing with this problem? 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:04:35
  Well, I, I will never, ever explained to her that, you know, I, I need to do schoolwork at nights so, it's finding time really to, you know to, to go to mom's. 

00:04:50
 Right, explain to whom? (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
 My sister. 

00:04:55
 To your sister, right. (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
 Yeah. 

00:04:55
 So, one option is to what you've already tried in fact which is explaining to her this, your situation. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:05:00
 What other options can you see to help you resolve this problem? 

00:05:05
LINDA GASK Two options emerged, making time to visit her mother on weekdays or talking to her sister and explaining that it's just isn't possible because of her schoolwork. The doctor and patient here begin to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each option. 

00:05:20
  And shall we start with the option of you going once or twice during the week... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
Advantages 

00:05:30
 ...as well as the weekends. And I think we should look at the advantages and the disadvantage of each. Can you see the advantages of doing that for you? 

00:05:40
 Um. Oh, yeah, I mean she will get off of my back then. 

00:05:45
 All right. She will get off your back. Any other advantages? 

00:05:50
 I suppose our mom would be pleased to see me. 

00:05:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:05:55
 Well, that means she just, she really is just sort (inaudible[00:06:01.030]) whenever you go anywhere, you know, she doesn't sort of, she doesn't seem to appreciate that what you're doing anyway, I suppose (inaudible ). 

00:06:12
 She doesn't? 

00:06:12
 No. (crosstalk) 

00:06:12
 All right. Okay. So, you doing the option of, of, of you going during the week as well as the weekends. Do you feel that it would get Sue(ph) off your back... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
 ...(inaudible[00:06:24.476]) said. Um, but although your mother might not show much sign of it, she might appreciate you. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
 Uh-hmm. 

00:06:30
Disadvantages 

00:06:30
 Um, (inaudible[00:06:32.621]). Now, let's look at the disadvantages in doing that? 

00:06:35
 (sighs) I tried to fit in, you know, with, with what I'm doing. 

00:06:40
 You're trying to visit her with... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
 ...the rest of your life. 

00:06:40
LINDA GASK  They reached agreement about talking to her sister as the favored option. Goals are then clarified. 

00:06:50
Clarifies goals 

00:06:50
 So, so really what you'd be hoping to achieve when you talk with your sister is that she would agree to the situation and she would stop, um, putting pressure on you. 

00:07:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:07:05
 And also that you should come to an agreement about who's going to visit, visit when, presumably and... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
 Yeah. 

00:07:15
 ...and would you be aiming to keep it as it is now? 

00:07:15
  I think so, yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
 You think so, right. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
 If it (inaudible[00:07:23.935]) this way. 

00:07:20
 Yes, thank you. So, that's the, that's the two, the goals of your life if, (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
Works out steps 

00:07:25
 if, of the option that you've chosen. Right. Now, I think what we should do is, is look at the steps that we're going to need to go through or that you're going to need to go through hopefully to achieve that goal. And to look at some of the difficulties that might arise and how you might resolve those difficulties. Um, what are the steps, in fact, that you'll need to go through to get there? 

00:07:55
 Um, I, I need to inform her I suppose and we'll arrange to meet her. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
 Uh-hmm. All right. All right. 

00:08:00
  I'll ask her to come to our house or... (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
  Right. 

00:08:10
 ...or meet her. 

00:08:10
 Either meet her or ask her to come to the house. (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:08:10
 Right. 

00:08:10
LINDA GASK  Realistically, of course, things can go wrong and it can be very helpful to plan ahead. Help the patient to identify possible difficulties so that they can be coped with. This is called stress inoculation. The doctor checks out what the worst possible response of the patient's sister, in this case might be. 

00:08:35
 Can you see what might be the, the worst possible response you'll get from your sister? I think we should have to work through that. 

00:08:45
  I think the worst thing that could be that she's, that she'll say that she's done enough and, and she won't, she will just say she's not going (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:09:07
 Right. 

00:09:07
 -I think she'll blame it on me, you know, she'll, she'll say to my mom that she's not going because of me. So, my mom will blame me then... (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
 Right. 

00:09:15
 ...for it. 

00:09:15
 Right. 

00:09:15
 You know, she'll say that I've caused this whirlwind(ph) and then my mom will say that, she'll say that she's on her own the whole week because of what I've done, you know. I think I'll just get, and I don't know what to do about that. 

00:09:35
  Right. Okay. If that happens, what do you see of ways of dealing with it? 

00:09:40
LINDA GASK  Two additional points about the problem solving model. First of all patients may get stuck and may find it very difficult to generate alternatives within the consultation. In this case, the worst possible thing you can do is to start suggesting alternative yourself because then the patient doesn't actually own the solution. Ask them to go home, have a think about things, write down some alternatives, perhaps write down the pros and cons of each alternative and then come back and discuss it with you. The second thing to say is that the problem solving approach is very easily learned and easily taught. The patients can learn how to work out solutions to their problems themselves. You might even find it a very practical and helpful model yourself. Now, let's move on and look at coping strategies. 

00:10:30
Coping strategies What are the possible sources of help or support? How might they be used? How has the person managed in the past? What is the goal this time? How can this be prevented in future? Focus on the positive Help the patient to realistically adjust expectations Offer appropriate reassurance Provide empathy, encouragement and support Use a negotiating style Planning activities Task assignments Activity scheduling Sense of pleasure and achievement 

00:10:30
LINDA GASK When a problem is essentially insoluble, there are some important issues that have to be addressed. Help the patient to look at what their potential sources of help and support actually are. How it can be used? How have they managed previously if this has happened before? What do they want to try and achieve this time? Help them to look at what steps can be taken to ensure that this doesn't happen again. It's important to always try and help and focus on the positive. And sometimes it may be necessary to help patients to realistically adjust their expectations. Offer reassurance only when it's appropriate, but provide empathy, encouragement and support. And above all, remember to use a negotiating style. An important issue for many patients will be that they're doing by little because they're so depressed or what they are doing isn't giving them any pleasure or any sense of achievement. A task assignment might be an important first intervention for someone who's very, doing very little. Find out what he wants to achieve and help him do that by breaking the task down into manageable smaller tasks. This man has moved from an area where he had many friends, to one where he doesn't know very many people. This is a (inaudible[00:11:54.437]) to development of his social life. 

00:11:55
 You told me that one of your, things that you would like to do and you're not having been able to do is, is not getting out to meet people? 

00:12:05
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
 That's right, yeah. Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
 Uh-hmm. You, you said that in (inaudible [00:12:11.700]), you had lots of friends, is that true? (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
 Yeah. I do, (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
 Yeah. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) So, what I would like to do is when we look at some of the issues around going out and meeting other people... (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:20
 ...and maybe we'll think of ways of things that we could do for that. 

00:12:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:25
 What might be, but what, and what would you like, your sort of, your eventual goal to be in that? 

00:12:30
  I suppose it would be nice to have that kind of circle of friends... (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
 Right. 

00:12:40
 ...that I used to have, um, although instead opens up... (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
 ...(inaudible[00:12:46.681]) people for a long time since, (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
 I was first day. (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:45
  But, um, it would take time to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:50
  But I sort of like that (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:55
 Yeah, you know like, uh, people I could ring up... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:12:55
 ...or... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
 Right. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
  people just ringing me up and say, (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:00
 "Can we go out?" you know. 

00:13:00
 Uh hmm. So, that might be something we could aim for, but as you said it might take some time. So, maybe, how could we take the first step, what might be the ways we can start that off? 

00:13:10
  When you said join this (inaudible[00:13:17.380]) sports team... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
 Right, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
  but I haven't been along it yet. 

00:13:20
 Okay. 

00:13:20
 You know, I just haven't felt like it but, uh, (crosstalk) 

00:13:20
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:20
  I suppose maybe I should... (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
 ...uh, join the (inaudible ) I just... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
  What would be... (crosstalk) 

00:13:32
 ...I don't know. 

00:13:32
 ...the first, what would you, you know, what could be your first step in doing that? 

00:13:35
 Well, I have a sort of like evenings where I can go along and... (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:40
 ...and, and, and, and meet people and stuff, I think. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
 Right. 

00:13:40
  I want, uh, sort of social things, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:45
  but it's difficult going on your own but I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:50
 ...and other people were looking for, for squash partners and ... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
 All right. Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
 ...and I play squash so... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:13:55
  you know, their wife...(crosstalk) 

00:14:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:14:00
 ...doing that (inaudible ) so. (crosstalk) 

00:14:02
 Uh-hmm. Okay. All right. So... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:14:05
 ...would that be, would uh, you like that to be a sort of first, sort of small task and get into... (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:14:10
 ...that eventual goal. So we're really looking at that. 

00:14:10
 I could do it, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
 Uh-huh. 

00:14:10
LINDA GASK  You can ask the patient to keep a simple record of her activities and write how much of a sense of pleasure and/or achievement she gets from them. This patient is presented with depression and has problems with her business and also in her relationship. 

00:14:30
 One of the things that you said to me last time was that it's actually pretty difficult getting up and, and getting things done... (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
 Uh-hmm. 

00:14:35
 ...getting motivated. How have you been finding that? 

00:14:40
  Well, I'm not being, staying in bed sort of quite so long in the mornings. 

00:14:55
 Uh-hmm. 

00:14:55
 I think it would be (inaudible[00:14:58.303]) to get up for... (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
 Right. 

00:15:00
 you know, just being so grimmed, just sort of going into the same old boring place and you know, (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
 Okay, right. One of the things that the people often find when they're depressed is that they feel that they're not doing anything, they're not getting anything, um, active life and that seems to come through from what you're saying, is that, is that right? 

00:15:25
 Yeah. I just feel I'm just sort of stood there in the lawn(ph) and not getting out, really. 

00:15:30
 Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. I wonder if that's a fact or whether that's just the way things seem at the moment. One of the ways that we might be able to look at that is for you to keep a different kind of a diary, just writing down, jotting down what you do each day. 

00:15:50
 Right. 

00:15:50
  The reason that's useful is to actually see what you're able to do with your day and to pick up the things that you enjoy doing and the things that you achieved as well in the day. Wherein, for example, you may feel that you spent all morning doing nothing, but when you look at it, you've done a lot of housework or whatever. It may not be something you necessarily enjoy, but it may give you quite a sense of achievement. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
  Uh-hmm. 

00:16:20
 Okay. And, I guess it might be useful to record some of that so that we can see, uh, maybe the day seem long because you're just doing no sort of things... (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
 ...and not the things that you actually enjoy and nothing for you. 

00:16:35
 Yeah. 

00:16:35
  I wonder, therefore, whether that might be something you could do between now and the next time I see you. 

00:16:45
 Write down things that I do? (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
 Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. And the way to do that will be to fill these columns in with, um, splitting your days into two-hour slots and just... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
 Yeah. 

00:16:55
 ...jotting down what you're dong, just simple as washing up, reading paper or whatever. And then, doing some more rating, a different kind of rating. First of all, rating it for enjoyment. On a 1 to 10 scale in the same way as we have with, with your, with your mood. And with a sense of achievement, two separate things. Do you understand what I mean now? 

00:17:25
 Yeah. 

00:17:25
LINDA GASK This information can then be used to help give a patient permission to do something that they would enjoy or to help them plan activities that would increase their sense of self-esteem. 

00:17:35
 Do you ever do anything that you enjoy just for yourself on an ordinary day? 

00:17:40
 On an ordinary day? 

00:17:40
  Yeah. 

00:17:45
 Uh. 

00:17:45
  Do you ever get any awards for all these hard work that you put in? 

00:17:50
  Oh, I see. Well, I mean, take care of the kids, being with the kids when I'm not trying to do other things can be rewarding sometimes. Um, nothing much I can think of. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:18:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:18:10
  'Cause we all need that time... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
 Uh-hmm. 

00:18:15
 ... if we work as hard as you do, we all need time for, not only for ourselves, but also to reward ourselves. 

00:18:25
 Yeah. (inaudible ) like this. (crosstalk) 

00:18:29
  Exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
 There are so much to need to do. Um. 

00:18:30
  And also thinking positively about yourself rather negatively. 

00:18:40
 Yeah. I used to, I mean, I used to sew quite a bit and I like that a lot. It like a joy, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:18:50
  to start making something nice for myself. 

00:18:55
  Perhaps that would be a little bit of homework to do this week. To see... (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
 Um. (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
 ...if you can put some time aside everyday just for you and do something that you enjoy. 

00:19:10
LINDA GASK I talked to Trina White and Sue Power, the two actresses who played the patients in some of the shots that you've just seen. And asked them in turn about how they felt as patients when experiencing problem solving and also planning activities to give a sense of pleasure. 

00:19:25
  I find it very helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:19:30
 ...and, I mean, when you are depressed and you can actually, you know, the areas of your life aren't working the way you want them to work and it's almost like it's all grouped together. 

00:19:45
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:19:45
 So, looking at individual bits(ph) talking through that bits(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:19:50
 ...and it clarifies it, it clarifies the situation... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:19:55
 ...and, and also looking at what might go wrong... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:00
  was helpful... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:05
 ...and. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
LINDA GASK So you felt prepared? 

00:20:05
 Yes. 

00:20:05
LINDA GASK That's right. Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
 It, it did feel as if, yeah, it did, in bits of your life, you could have actually have some more, more control that you were feeling at... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
LINDA GASK Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
 ...at the time. 

00:20:15
  Because well, I mean we all know that we need to enjoy... (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
LINDA GASK Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
 ...the things. But, and when you're depressed, you can lose sight of that. Because it's such an effort just getting by and you can forget that, um, pleasure is necessary. (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:35
 And also because, I suppose 'cause you can feel worthless... (crosstalk) 

00:20:35
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:35
  And so it's like you don't deserve to have any pleasure. 

00:20:40
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:40
 So, having someone to help you focus on that. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
 It's like giving you permission almost. 

00:20:45
LINDA GASK Uh-hmm. 

00:20:45
  I think it's useful. 

00:20:50
Counselling strategies Behavioural - problem solving - coping strategies - planning activities Cognitive - eliciting automatic thoughts - intervening with automatic thoughts 

00:20:50
LINDA GASK Now we're going to move on and look at the strategies which has to do with connecting thinking and feeling. They're similar to those used in cognitive therapy and we've called them "Cognitive Strategies." Before we go on, remember that in the simplified model of dealing with worries and concerns that we looked at earlier, we're now looking at how to deal with unrealistic worries. Cognitive strategies can be very useful here. We must start off, however, by looking at the concept of automatic thoughts. 

00:21:20
LINDA GASK People who have a tendency to depression of mood often experience so-called negative automatic thoughts. For example, "Things always go wrong for me," or "I should work harder." When these thoughts are dwelled upon, it can lead to the onset of clinical depression. This often happens after a particularly significant life event. When clinical depression has set in, it can be maintained by dwelling on the negative automatic thoughts so that the vicious(ph) circle is then set up. It can be very helpful to help the patients to see the link between their negative automatic thoughts and their mood, the thought feeling linked. When this has been identified, you can then stop to help patients to challenge their negative automatic thoughts more successfully. 

00:22:10
Eliciting automatic thoughts Work through an example 'Here-and-now' changes during interview Keeping a record 

00:22:10
LINDA GASK Let's look at how you can elicit automatic thoughts and help patients to identify them. The first technique is to work through a specific example of an event. This patient was a teacher, has problems with her job. She works through how she felt one evening, and she came home and realized that she had enormous amount of work to do. 

00:22:30
 As well as doing all the, the normal amount of paperwork after they offered the national curriculum. 

00:22:40
 Right. 

00:22:40
 But I've got lots to stuffs(ph) as well. 

00:22:40
 As well? 

00:22:40
 In the evening. 

00:22:45
 Right. So, it was in the evening that you really began to feel quite low and fed up about it? 

00:22:50
 Well, yeah. It seems like... (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
 What about it? (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
 ...it seem I'm not good enough. 

00:22:50
Example 

00:22:50
 (inaudible[00:22:54.888]) Can you talk me through from when you first arrived home on Monday evening? 

00:23:00
 Um, well, I got home and it's about half past four. 

00:23:10
 Okay. 

00:23:10
 And, uh, my son Christopher was there. Uh, I, I supposed I started thinking about, you know, the amount of work I have to do and I should start it really before tea. 

00:23:30
Summarises thoughts 

00:23:30
 So that was just after you've arrived home, you're thinking about the amount of work that you have to do. 

00:23:35
 Yeah. 

00:23:35
 And that you should be starting soon.(crosstalk) 

00:23:35
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
Explores feelings 

00:23:35
  And how did you feel at that point? 

00:23:40
 Really low. 

00:23:45
 You felt really low? 

00:23:45
 Yeah. 

00:23:45
LINDA GASK When you've explored the thoughts and the feelings, you can then move on to help the patient draw links between them. 

00:23:55
 It does seem to me that on Monday evening, there was quite a clear link between what you're thinking in terms of the amount of work against the, the fact that you haven't yet done the work that you promised to yourself you're going to start and how you felt about it. There's a link there between what you were thinking and how you were feeling. Do you see a link... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
 ...there as well? 

00:24:20
 Yes. 

00:24:20
 Uh-hmm. You do. Right. 

00:24:25
LINDA GASK You can use a similar approach to explore how the patient feels in the here-and-now and again help them to draw a links between thoughts and feelings. 

00:24:35
Explores feelings 

00:24:35
 Now, I'd like to move with you into the present and ask you how you're feeling right now in yourself. 

00:24:40
  I feel guilty. 

00:24:50
 You feel guilty? 

00:24:50
 Fed up. 

00:24:50
  Fed up? 

00:24:55
 I'm feeling low. 

00:24:55
Explores thoughts 

00:24:55
 Really low. All right. And what thoughts are going through your head right now? 

00:25:05
 I don't think I'm a good teacher anymore. 

00:25:10
 You don't think you're a good teacher anymore? 

00:25:10
 No. You know, that people seem to be, other people seem to be able to, you know, just cope with all these extra work and I don't. 

00:25:30
LINDA GASK Sometimes you're actually a witness in mood change during a consultation. You can use this to help the patient draw links between what they were thinking at that time and how they were feeling. Another example of the here-and-now. This man has been reluctant to accept anti-depressants and just wanted counseling. 

00:25:50
 Um, maybe I'd like to, um, have another look at this in another two months and... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
 ...see if, if we're not getting very far with these ideas... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:26:00
 ...whether we might actually start taking you up, putting you on anti-depressants. 

00:26:00
  All right. Um.(crosstalk) 

00:26:10
 You don't look terribly happy about that? 

00:26:10
 What? It just that, um, so you don't think that it will work... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
  Uh-hmm. 

00:26:20
 ...by now (inaudible ) is that what you're saying? 

00:26:22
 Is that what went through your mind now? (crosstalk) 

00:26:22
 No. I just don't, I just wanted to work but... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:26:25
  I don't think I will. 

00:26:30
 All right. That's what, what's going through your mind that might not. 

00:26:35
 I don't know... (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
 Uh-hmm. 

00:26:35
 ...it just might not. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
 Right. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
 And you're looking sad, are you feeling sad at the same time? 

00:26:45
 Yeah. I am now. I... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:26:45
 ...quite, I don't see any way out of it somehow. 

00:26:50
Draw Links 

00:26:50
 Uh-hmm. I mean, that's, that's very interesting because that's one of the things we're gonna be looking at is actually the relationship between feeling sad and not feeling good. And the, some of the thoughts that you maybe having around at the time... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
 Yeah. 

00:27:05
 ...and, and see whether they are linked. I think they maybe... (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
 ... And whether we can find ways of helping you with that. 

00:27:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:27:15
 And we had actually, in the sense, we had the, the trigger of this was me talking about we begin the anti-depressants then you said you felt sad and you thought at the same time, "This might not work." 

00:27:25
  Yeah. 

00:27:30
 Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
 It can be useful to ask the patient to keep a record of his negative automatic thoughts over a couple of days. This can be useful in checking out motivation and it will give you important information about what events can provoke negative automatic thoughts and feelings which are important for the patient. Ask the patient to record the event, how they felt, the severity of that feeling. For example, not might be as bad they have ever felt and 10 as good as good as they ever felt. And then ask them to try and remember what they were thinking. In other words, help them to try and recognize their negative automatic thoughts. 

00:28:05
  Uh-huh. 

00:28:10
 What I would like you to do, before you come and see me next week, is to do just a tiny bit of homework for me and that is to keep a diary. 

00:28:15
  A diary? 

00:28:20
 Uh-hmm. Just for a couple of days. It can be any, any couple of days that you like before you come next time. And I'd like you to bring the diary with you when you come. Now, I do have a booklet here, which has really quite a lot useful information in it. But what I particularly want to show is this little diary here. It's got four columns across the top. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:28:45
 One is the events column, okay? So, what you need to do is to record any events over the two days that you keep in the diary that made you feel bad, all right? And by that, if it's really bad, I want you to, in this column over here, I want you to rate how bad you feel, okay? So, note if you'd be feeling really bad, I mean, as bad as when you came to see me last week. But 10, if you'd be feeling on top of the world. 

00:29:15
 All right. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
 Okay. So, when something happens that makes you feel bad, I want you to write down what happened and how you felt, okay? And at the same time, I want you to try and remember what was going through your mind at that time? What thoughts you're having, okay? 

00:29:35
 Yeah. 

00:29:35
 Were you blaming yourself for a thing? 

00:29:40
Intervening with automatic thoughts Questioning the evidence Hypothesis testing Generating alternatives Reattribution 

00:29:40
LINDA GASK Now, let's look at strategies for intervening with negative automatic thoughts. It's important to neither discard the thoughts nor to predict them. You're there to provide questions. Look at the evidence for and against the thought with the patient. Ask the patient what alternative interpretations might be made. Help him to distinguish between ideas and facts. Consider how hypothesis might be tested out. It's important to try and maintain a neutral stance. If you don't, your interventions might come over as pull yourself together. Be collaborative, negotiate ideas with the patient and check out your conclusions at all times. 

00:30:25
Evidence for and against 

00:30:25
 You told me before that, um, people always seem to bring you up when they feel sorry for you. Now, I would like to look at that in a little bit more detail and think of some of the evidence you have for it (inaudible[00:30:39.532]) and some evidence you may have against that. 

00:30:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:30:45
 What do you have as an idea for that? 

00:30:45
 Well, I just think it was the girl. 

00:30:50
 Uh-huh. 

00:30:50
 The other evening 'cause I, I thought about that... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
 ...you know, since, And, um, I suppose she just, she's just not that kind of person... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:31:00
 ...to do that, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:31:00
 ...'cause she's not the sort of person (inaudible[00:31:04.481]) who... 

00:31:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:31:00
  cares for people and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
 Uh-huh. 

00:31:05
 ...mostly kinda mean, you know.(crosstalk) 

00:31:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:31:05
 I just don't know when she rang... 

00:31:10
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
 ...yeah, it's great, she likes me so... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
  and then the next minute, I thought, I don't know, is she just feeling... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
 ...sorry for me... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
 Hmm. 

00:31:15
 ...'cause that's what a person she is, (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
 you know. 

00:31:20
 Are there is, um, are there any people who don't seem to bring you up for that reason? 

00:31:25
  Well, yeah, there is one... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
 ...who is, yeah, this friend of mine. (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
  All right. Yeah, Uh-hmm. 

00:31:35
 (inaudible[00:31:36.214]), who, um, who rings and (inaudible[00:31:39.440]). (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
  He's an old friend. He's a good bloke. 

00:31:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:31:40
 Good friend and uh, yeah, he may, I suppose. I don't really know. 

00:31:45
 Uh-hmm. It looks you're not too sure about whether he does. 

00:31:50
 What do you mean? I just, yhat's what everybody does... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
 Well. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
 ...well, I mean, I just. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
Test hypothesis 

00:31:55
 Uh-hmm. Could we, could we check that out actually with him. You, you, you said he was close friendHmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
 Yeah, he is. (crosstalk) 

00:32:00
  Could we actually think of a way of, of checking out if he does so, because he does feel sorry for you. 

00:32:05
  I don't really know how he feels about the things... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
  Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
 ...I mean, I don't think he's, he probably thinks I've change and... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
 ...I'm different now. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
 Because I can always ask him about that... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
 ...I mean, I can ask him whether he, he thinks I've changed. 

00:32:25
 Uh-hmm. Would you feel comfortable doing that with him? 

00:32:30
 I supposed I could deal with... (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 ...him. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 I could deal with him, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
 ...I couldn't with, with anybody else. 

00:32:35
 Okay. All right. Or maybe that might be a thing that we should we look at and I may ask you to do that with... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 ...your friend. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 Yeah. We could do that. Yeah.(crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 Uh-hmm. And just check out if, if, if, you know, if we, is what, if all people do that or whether he might, people... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
 ...people who doesn't. 

00:32:45
  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
 I could ask him about it. 

00:32:50
Generates alternatives 

00:32:50
 Uh-hmm. And maybe we should look at us, maybe some of the, could we think of any other reasons why, for example, this girl... 

00:33:00
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
 ...has phoned you up. 

00:33:00
 Hmm. 

00:33:00
 Otherwise, I'm feeling sorry for you. 

00:33:05
 Oh, I suppose, I mean, we do have a laugh, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
 ...in the canteen. She does come over. 

00:33:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:33:15
 And talk to me quite long. 

00:33:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:33:15
 So, it's possible that she just wants to be friendly... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
 ...wants to know me better. 

00:33:20
 All right. So that might be one alternative thing for... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
 ...any other things that you might, might come up as an idea of why she might be talking to you? Why she doesn't feel sorry for you? 

00:33:35
 Well, at first, she does make feel quite... 

00:33:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
 ...you know, it's a good sign to... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
 ...attempt to, to rise at the occasion that we, (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
 I suppose, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
 ...with her, I feel that I do tend to... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
 ...put on a front to. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
 Uh-huh. 

00:33:50
 (inaudible[00:33:52.786]) 

00:33:50
 Might sure she noticed how bad you're feeling, isn't it? (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
 maybe she doesn't know. 

00:33:55
 Uh-huh. 

00:33:55
 Yeah. 

00:33:55
 So, that might be another alternative as well as that... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
 Hmm. 

00:34:00
 ...she's that, you know, she finds you fun, but actually she may not notice that you're feeling so bad. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
 Uh-hmm. Yes. 

00:34:05
 Sees no reason to feel sorry about you. 

00:34:05
LINDA GASK  For many depressed patients, self-blame is a frequent occurrence. Try and help the patient to see clearly how much they're responsible for and how much other people are responsible for and to appropriately reattribute blame where it's due. 

00:34:20
LINDA GASK  This patient has realized that his initial thought that he was responsible for problem at work was in fact wrong. He successfully asked questions and found out that in fact it wasn't all his faults. 

00:34:35
 You told me that you went back to work? 

00:34:40
 Hmm. 

00:34:40
 The first couple days were okay and then you had this problem when somebody came up to complain about the kitchen. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
 Yeah. 

00:34:45
 And I think, we sort of looked at the thought you have said, "It's all my fault." 

00:34:50
 Yeah. 

00:34:50
 Uh-hmm. Could we actually, I mean, since like the other example, think of other interpretations you could have had of that event, whether it's... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
 Well. (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
 ...my fault. 

00:35:00
 At that time, I thought... 

00:35:05
 Hmm. 

00:35:05
 ...'coz I've measured up the kitchen, you know, I measured up the space... (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
 Hmm. Uh-huh. 

00:35:05
  and, and sold them the kitchen. And then I made a (inaudible[00:35:14.296]) turn... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
 ...that's the one, the one I do is come to fitting it 'cause... (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
 ...one of the units was wrong and... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
 Uh-hmm. 

00:35:20
 ...I thought may or maybe I haven't, (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:35:25
 I haven't, you know, 'cause at the moment... (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 ...recently, (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 I've just been (inaudible[00:35:28.859]) being not... (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
 Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
 ...not written down things properly or then I thought maybe that I've done that and, and given them the wrong... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
 ...measurement for the space. But I actually I don't think that was the case. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:35:40
 I think frankly they'd just... (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:35:40
 ... they'd just taken the wrong unit. 

00:35:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
 Um. 

00:35:45
 So, it was somebody else's fault? (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
 Well, it was actually, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
 Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was. (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:35:50
 But you know how the things get you... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 ...when you're not in the sort of frame of mind that you think, (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 "Oh, it's me again," (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 kind of thinking. 

00:35:55
 So, how could you actually focus on that, if maybe you know you have that kind of thought again? What might be the technique you could use? 

00:36:05
  Um, I just, I suppose I could just tell myself that with this, (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
 Uh-hmm. 

00:36:15
  that I've felt this before... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 ...that it was, it wasn't my fault and... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 ...therefore, it might be the same with this. 

00:36:25
 And also we're looking at the evidence, you know, the real evidence... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
 Yeah. That's right. 

00:36:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:36:25
  Yeah. Yet, it didn't turn out to be... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
 Uh-hmm. 

00:36:30
 ...not my fault. 

00:36:30
 No.

Counseling strategies Behavioural - problem solving - coping strategies - planning activities Cognitive - eliciting automatic thoughts - intervening with automatic thoughts 

00:36:30
LINDA GASK  We now look to a number of strategies the counseling patients with depression and primary care. Now we're going to get you to rehearse some of these. In particular, we're going to look at the skills for eliciting and intervening with negative automatic thoughts. You'll be given some information and the cue from the tape and ask to respond. You can work alone but it's better to work in pairs with a colleague, one playing the doctor and other playing the patient. Then you can swap around. When you see this caption 

00:37:05
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:37:05
LINDA GASK - practice your response. We'll then show you an example of how the strategy might have been used. 

00:37:10
LINDA GASK Watch this short excerpt from one of the consultations with the patient that you just seen and think about how you would ask him about the specific example of when people bring him up. How would you actually ask the question to get him to talk about a specific example? If you're working in pairs, you may find it helpful to know that when a girl from work recently rang him up, he really felt quite down because he thought that she was only ringing him up because she felt sorry for him. 

00:37:40
 I mean, sometimes, I mean, people do, uh, do ring up, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
 and say, "Do you wanna do something about this day?" I feel like, you know. 

00:37:50
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:37:50
LINDA GASK  Now let's look at how specific example was actually inquired about. Watch how thoughts and feelings were explored in turn and then links were drawn between them. 

00:38:10
 Sometimes, I mean, people do, uh, do ring up, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
 Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
 and say, "Do you wanna do something about this day?" I feel like, you know, that's uh. (crosstalk) 

00:38:20
Example 

00:38:20
 Uh-hmm. Can you tell me about a recent example of that? 

00:38:25
 Oh, that somebody rang up? (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:38:25
 Just, just the other night actually (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
  Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
 This girl from work rang up. Um, so I really like her, she's really nice and stuff and she, she, uh, she said (inaudible[00:38:37.857]) a couple are going out and she's from around the corner... (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
  Uh-huh. 

00:38:40
 ...from work and, uh, didn't want to go and I thought, well, it's nice if they thought of me, (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
 you know, which, um (crosstalk) 

00:38:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:38:45
  Then I, then I made the effort or maybe they just feel sorry for me... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
 ...and I just don't want ,um, maybe that's only. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
Explores thoughts 

00:38:55
 Uh-huh. So what would that mean if they felt sorry for you? 

00:39:00
 Oh, I just thought, well, they just think I may gonna drag them out I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:39:05
 ...I know I've gone out before... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
  and it happenned I just sat there. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
 I thought, I, I should be with people and whenever I'm there, I just, I just feel like a drag and so, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
 I must be boring. 

00:39:15
 So, you checked it out if that was wrong but you're thinking that you will drag them, so that was that, would that stop you from going out, do you think? 

00:39:25
 Yeah. 

00:39:25
 Uh-hmm. How did you feel when you were thinking that? 

00:39:30
  It just made feel really tired(ph). Just useless really, though. 

00:39:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:39:35
  It was like, you know, it is, I just felt sorry for me and... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
 Uh-hmm. 

00:39:45
 ...'cause I was miserable and why do I sit there... (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
 ...I just, (inaudible[00:39:54.040]), (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
  it made me feel pretty awful. 

00:39:55
 Uh-hmm. What you were like before that? 

00:39:55
 Sorry before? 

00:39:55
  Before the phone call? 

00:40:00
  Well, I was, I suppose it was evening, so I was, (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
 Uh-hmm. 

00:40:05
 you know, and I was feeling too caught up... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
  was sort of to pick up the bed, (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
 you know, in the evenings. Um. 

00:40:10
Draws links 

00:40:10
  So, that sounds as if, that you have a sort of this low feeling about the time of that thought you're having? (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
  Yeah, sort of pitched(ph) me... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
 ...back into, just... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
 ...feeling like, Oh, what I can do sort of thing. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
 I don't feel like anything. 

00:40:25
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
LINDA GASK Now, let's look to another technique for listing negative automatic thoughts, here-and-now. Watch this excerpt from an interview which you saw a little earlier in which the patient talks about her disappointment of not yet having had children and about time running out. How could you use this statement "time running out" to help her explore her negative automatic thoughts and her links between the way she's thinking and the way that she's feeling. It might help you if you're role playing a patient to know that when she thinks "time is running out" she feels helpless, panicky and low. 

00:41:05
 Well, I don't know like it's going to happen and. 

00:41:10
 Hmm. Well (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
 Maybe you know. 

00:41:10
  Okay. What will it mean if it doesn't happen? 

00:41:20
[sil.] 

00:41:20
  My, I, I don't know what to do. 

00:41:25
  Well, we'll do it (inaudible[00:41:31.224]) 

00:41:30
 Well, I just feel time is running out really. 

00:41:35
 Uh-huh. In what sense? How old are you? 

00:41:35
 I'm 32. 

00:41:35
  Right. 

00:41:40
 And I put all this in, in a decade into the business and (inaudible[00:41:43.498]). (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
 Uh-hmm. 

00:41:40
  You know, I just like to have a baby before it's, before it's too late. 

00:41:55
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:41:55
LINDA GASK  Now, let's look at how you might have used that statement of her thoughts to begin to draw links between thoughts and feelings. 

00:42:05
Explores feelings 

00:42:05
  Hmm. The other thing that sometimes helps is recognizing the way we think affects the way feel. Can I just use an example to show how using that sort of help might, might be useful. You, you said to be (inaudible ) when you're talking about children. You're sad. You felt time was running out. How does it make you feel when you think that? 

00:42:40
  I'm kind of helpless really and I don't know how to go, you know, I don't know what to do and... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
 Sure. 

00:42:50
 ...panicky. 

00:42:50
 Right. So that makes you, that thought that time is running out makes you, makes you feel quite worried and, (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
 and low. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
 Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
 Is that right? (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
  Uh-hmm. 

00:43:00
 Okay. 

00:43:00
Eliciting automatic thoughts Working through an example 'Here-and-now' changes during interview Keeping a record 

00:43:00
LINDA GASK Now, I'd like you to practice how you would ask the patient to keep a record of negative automatic thoughts. What exactly would you say? How would you explain it? 

00:43:20
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:43:20
LINDA GASK Now let's see how you might explain to the patient how to keep a record. 

00:43:20
 Uh-huh. 

00:43:20
  Now, what I would like to do is give you this booklet which also has some other interesting information I'd like you to read about depression. And maybe get you to fill in a diary or a record of what's been going on between now and the next time you see me in a few days time. 

00:43:35
  All right 

00:43:40
 Okay. Now, I'd like to do it maybe the same way you have been looking at in sessions, is looking at events or, you know, like a phone call. And looking at what's going through your mind at the time. How you're feeling. 

00:43:50
 All right 

00:43:50
  Um, and also if you could also write of how bad that feeling is. And what sort of a scale of 10 feeling very good about yourself. 

00:44:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:44:00
  And not feeling the worst you ever felt. 

00:44:05
 Uh-huh. Right. 

00:44:05
 Okay. Is, is that clear? 

00:44:10
 Yeah. You know, I think it is clear. I could do that. (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:44:10
LINDA GASK Now we're going to move on to practice strategies of how you might intervene with negative automatic thoughts. 

00:44:20
Intervening with automatic thoughts. Questioning the evidence Hypotheses testing Generating alternatives Reattribution 

00:44:20
LINDA GASK We're going to start off by practicing how you would question the evidence formed against the thought and help the patient to test out a hypothesis. 

00:44:30
 Jill, you told me last week how you think that you're the only one at your school who is unable to cope with all the additional workload. And in fact you've, you've recorded that thoughts, or variations of that thought in your diary several times entered last week. 

00:44:50
 Yeah. 

00:44:50
  When you think about that just now, how does it make you feel? 

00:45:00
  Oh. Fed up. 

00:45:05
 Fed up. So, there's a real link between believing that you can't cope with the work that everybody else can... (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
 Uh-hmm. 

00:45:15
 ...on the one hand. And on the other hand you're feeling fed up. 

00:45:20
LINDA GASK She clearly describes how she thinks that she's the only person at school who can't cope with extra work and how she's feeling because of this. How would you help her to explore the evidence for and against this thought. If you're going to be role playing Jill, I can tell you that the evidence for this thought is that a colleague of hers recently took her to the netball practice for her so that her colleague is now working two extra nights a week. Jill feels that this is evidence that the colleague can cope. In terms of evidence against this thought, Jill can't come, come up with any evidence at all against the thought that she's the only person who can't cope. 

00:46:00
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:46:00
LINDA GASK  Now let's see what actually happened. 

00:46:10
 Yeah, it was, I, I thought I can't, I can't cope better than I can. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right. 

00:46:15
 And also, that's why I stopped doing, you know, after school. 

00:46:25
 After school work? (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
 After school work. (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
Evidence for and against 

00:46:25
 Right. What I'd like to do with you now is to look at the evidence for that belief of yours. That everybody else in school is coping with the work except you. What is the evidence for that belief? 

00:46:45
 Well that, as I said that, and I felt this, you know, I couldn't cope because of all the extra, extra work, paperwork of what to do then. 

00:47:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:47:00
 I just couldn't carry on doing ways doing that both. 

00:47:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
 And, um, well, then (inaudible ) not to, one of the colleagues only... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
 Uh-huh. 

00:47:13
 ...and the teachers. And, um, well, she offered to me, well, she said she'll do it for me. 

00:47:15
  Right 

00:47:20
 Um, I mean, is that means that she's doing like two nights now. 

00:47:20
  Right. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
 And I'm not doing any. (crosstalk) 

00:47:25
 You're not doing any. 

00:47:25
 So, it means obviously, obviously she's coping. 

00:47:25
  Okay. So, you've identified one individual at school who does seem to be coping with her extra academic work? 

00:47:35
 Uh-hmm 

00:47:35
 And the evidence to that is that she's been able to take one additional extracurricular activities. Is there any evidence against that belief of yours that you're the only one who isn't coping? 

00:47:55
[sil.] 

00:47:55
  I don't know. 

00:48:00
LINDA GASK Now, how could you get to test out this hypothesis that every else can cope? How could you ask about this? I'll give you a clue, she does of course have other colleagues that she could ask. 

00:48:10
Stop the videotape Remember the cue Practise the skills 

00:48:10
LINDA GASK  Now let's see how you might have got the patient to test out that particular hypothesis. 

00:48:25
 So, I think that perhaps what we should do now is see if we can test that belief against the real world for you. If we can find a way of, of actually testing whether what you believe is really true or whether it's a product of how you've been feeling recently. 

00:48:45
  How could we do that? 

00:48:50
 I was going to ask you that. Can you see any way of checking out, perhaps with your colleagues, whether you are in fact the only person who isn't coping? 

00:49:00
Tests hypothesis 

00:49:00
 I mean, does it, does it mean that I'll have to actually ask them I suppose? 

00:49:10
  Does that cause you a problem? 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
  Um, I suppose I could. 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:40
  You didn't sound very certain. 

00:49:45
 All this, I don't want a lot of people to know that I'm not coping, you know. 

00:49:55
 Okay. Is there... (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
  But that's how. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
 ...anybody at school you can check this out with? 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:05
  Yeah. Yeah, there is that I could ask. Yeah, I could ask Joe(ph). 

00:50:15
  You could ask one of your colleagues? 

00:50:20
 Yeah. He's been, uh, (inaudible[00:50:23.664) of other teachers... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
 ...are fairly new and. 

00:50:25
 Uh-hmm. 

00:50:25
 He is quite a bit younger. I suppose Jones(ph). Well, he's younger than me, but he's more of my age. 

00:50:30
 Okay. How would you feel about asking him? 

00:50:35
  Um. No, I think I could ask him. 

00:50:45
LINDA GASK She does this and reports back that her hypothesis does not in fact hold up. Other colleagues are also finding it very hard to cope. 

00:50:55
  Yeah, I did, I did manage to talk to a couple of people. 

00:51:00
 Uh-hmm. 

00:51:00
 And I talked to Joe(ph) the one I had mentioned before. 

00:51:05
 Yes. 

00:51:05
  And, and in fact he's having quite, quite a few problems. It's quite a shock really. 

00:51:15
 Right. (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
 You know, I suppose I just assume that, you know, the other people were, were actually coping. He said he's found um, you know, the changes that that have been made and... 

00:51:30
 Uh-huh. 

00:51:30
 ...it has quite affected him. And, (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
 Right. (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
 and there is so much paperwork to do. 

00:51:35
 Right. 

00:51:35
Eliciting automatic thoughts Work through an example 'Here-and-now' changes during interview Keeping a record Intervening with automatic thoughts Questioning the evidence Hypothesis testing Generating alternatives Reattribution When to refer Severe symptoms or psychosis High suicidal risk or hopelessness Helplessness or passivity Multiple or complex problems Unresolved conflicts or losses Personality disorder Chronic problems 

00:51:35
LINDA GASK You have an opportunity to practice some of the techniques for eliciting negative automatic thoughts and some simple techniques for intervening with negative automatic thoughts. Remember don't take on more than you can handle. Seek advice, support, someone to talk things over with. And if you would become particularly interested in this form of counseling, look into opportunities for further training. Remember that when patients are very severely depressed, the link between thoughts and feelings disappears. Now, it's amenable to this sorts of interventions. Patients who feel hopeless need more intensive help. Passive patients are also difficult to help if they are expected to be done to rather than actually involve in treatment. Patients who repeatedly harm themselves can also be very difficult to help in this way. 

00:52:25
LINDA GASK  Of course, you wouldn't expect to get through all of these strategies in one consultation. You might use one or two in an average ten-minute consultation with a patient. It's also really important to say that the use of anti-depressants doesn't in anyway preclude the use of these strategies. In fact, counseling strategies can be used very effectively in combination with anti-depressant treatment. Now, you have to go away and have a goal at practicing some of these skills. A very good way to do this is to record your own consultations either using videotape and audiotape and to play them back in the company of sympathetic colleagues so that you can begin the...
