THE UNIVERSITY of MANCHESTER SCHOOL OF PSYCHIATRY & BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES supported by the MENTAL HEALTH FOUNDATION CBT cognitive behavioural therapy for adolescents with mood disorders INTRODUCTION treating depression in adolescents Professor Richard Harrington, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Manchester 

00:00:00
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  It's been known for a long time that an adult-like depressive condition can and do occur, ah, during adolescence. For many years, however, these states were commonly supposed to be adolescent turmoil and to be of little or no psychopathological significance. However, recent research suggests that it is important to treat depressive disorders in adolescents for three main reasons. First of all, ah, we now know that these conditions are highly recurrent. Recent research suggests that in excess of 50 percent of adolescents with moderate or severe depressive disorders are going to have a recurrence within the next year or so. Second, these conditions are strongly associated with impairment in most areas of the adolescents' functioning. For example, severely depressed adolescents have considerable difficulties coping at school and also have impaired peer relationships. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it's important to treat these conditions because of their strong continuity to adulthood. More than 40 percent of adolescents with severe depressive disorders will have a recurrence after their 18th birthday, as also a significant risk of attempted or even completed suicide. 

00:02:15
social skills training - interpersonal psychotherapy - relaxation therapy - family therapy 

00:02:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Two kinds of treatment are commonly available for the treatment of major depression in adolescents. Tri-cyclic anti-depressant medication has been evaluated in several studies and so far, ah, the results suggest that tri-cyclics are no more effective, ah, than placebo, and occasionally associated with serious side effects. The second main type of treatment that is available is psychological treatment, of which probably the most extensively evaluated is cognitive behaviour therapy, which is the subject of this videotape. 

00:02:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON The cognitive behavioual program that we're going to demonstrate has been evaluated in a series of controlled studies in the University of Manchester. In the first of these studies, ah, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT, was compared to an inactive comparison psychological treatment of relaxation training. The subject for this, ah, study was very typical of those, ah, coming to see child adolescent psychiatrists and comprised, ah, children in the age range from 11, ah, through to 16 years, ah, predominantly girls. 

00:03:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON This slide shows the results. By the end of treatment, ah, more than a half of depressed adolescents, ah, given CBT had remitted clinically. By contrast, less than a third of those given relaxation training were remitted. These results have been published, ah, in a paper in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. 

00:03:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  The CBT Program that we're going to describe, ah, draws on, ah, research evidence from two main areas. Ah, first, from controlled studies of cognitive behaviour therapy for major depression in adults. Ah, second, on studies of the clinical picture of major depression in adolescents. 

00:04:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON This s shows the three main areas of difficulty, ah, that have been highlighted by this research. Negative styles of thinking. Depressed adolescents tend to have poor self-esteem and to experience strong feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. They perceive the world acting on them. Difficulties with social relationships. Depression in adolescents is strongly associated with difficulties in social relationships, most commonly taking the form of social withdrawal, a lack of social skills, and social problem solving deficits. Symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression experienced by depressed adolescents, include sleep disturbance, inactivity and lack of interest. Depressed adolescents frequently experience suicidal thinking. The therapy is designed to target these three main areas. 

00:05:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  This video has been designed to accompany, ah, the treatment (inaudible ) that was developed in the Department of Child Psychiatry in the University of Manchester. It's aimed at mental health practitioners who have experience of working with adolescents, who know something of depressive disorders in adolescents and who are familiar with some of the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The video is essentially practical and aims to teach practical skills in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 

00:05:50
1 cognitive behavioural therapy theoretical background 

00:05:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Chrissie Verduyn, uhm, is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist from the Manchester Children's Hospital Trust who has extensive experience of using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in her work with both adults and adolescents. 

00:06:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  So what form does Cognitive Therapy take for children and adolescents? 

00:06:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Cognitive therapy is a one-to-one treatment with, obviously, with children and adolescents that will involve working with families, and possibly with other involved professionals as well. It's basically a collaborative treatment that you work together with got, on goals that the, uhm, that the child or adolescent has defined with you and it's working very much in the here and now. Homework tasks since activities are outside session are really very important. And they will often be monitored, monitored by asking the young persons who are to keep a record, for instance, or a diary of some sort. 

00:06:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Uh-hum. And how is it used to treat depression? 

00:06:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  With depression, there seem to be particular patterns of thought that require tackling in a particular, particular way. The, ahm, theory was developed by Aron Beck. 

00:07:10
Beck's cognitive formulation of depression Early experience Formation of dysfunctional beliefs Critical incident Assumption activated Negative automatic thoughts Symptoms of depression behavioural moods thoughts physical reactions 

00:07:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN He wrote about how early experiences can lead to the formation of assumptions about oneself and the world which are negative and irrational. Once present, these assumptions might be reactivated by a particular event in one's life. A loss, for example. A pattern of automatic thoughts about oneself, the world, and the future is then set up, which directly cause the symptoms of depression. For instance, thoughts such as, "Nobody loves me", "I'm no good at anything", "The future is hopeless", result in a lowering of mood and the corresponding change in behaviour. The person may start to take a much less active role in life because they're not feeling good and to behave in a way that can make some of the thoughts seem true. The problem is not only what the person thinks, their negative thoughts, but also how they think, their thought processes which are illogical and irrational. Depressed individuals tend to misperceive the world and their experiences in ways which reinforce their negative thoughts. They thus systematically distort their experience in keeping with their beliefs, and then avoid activities because they anticipate a negative outcome. Cognitive Therapy concentrates on identifying and correcting these cognitive distortions and processes. 

00:08:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The core of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy involves working on both cognitions or thoughts and on behaviour. The aspects of working on cognitions involves not just thinking about what young people are thinking, but also how they are thinking and what the end result is. So, then also, we are looking at some very typical aspects of behaviour and how, what we do affect we how we feel. So we might be thinking with young people about boosting their self-confidence, or helping feel better about themselves, and taking on both more activities which will increase the chances that they're doing things that they enjoy. 

00:09:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. So Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with children and adolescents involves some, both getting the thoughts, cognitions if you like, and with trying to change behaviour? 

00:09:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yes. 

00:09:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON I see. And, ah, do, does that differ according to the age of the child? Would you be using cognitive techniques more with older kids and behavioural ones more with the younger kids, or would you pick and mix, so to speak, depending on the problem the child have? 

00:09:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think, in general, it depends on the problem the child has, but also at some extent on how cognitively sophisticated they are, and that isn't just a matter of intelligence, that some, some young people, some children are more mature than others have a broader understanding of, of themselves, for instance, and so are more able to reflect on their own thought processes... (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Hmm. 

00:10:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ... with people often younger but who are more concrete. You need to take a different kind of approach that isn't quite so reflective and, and allows them to, uhm, give them tasks that they, they're actually able to do within their own cognitive processing. 

00:10:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON How much do you involve, the, the parents, ah, in, in the therapy? 

00:10:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Well, parents are very important, obviously for, for a, for a number of reasons. That, that for one, the reason it may be important that, that a parent needs to understand the purposes of the therapy and why is it they can be involved right from the outset so that they can support the young person both in attending if they're feeling, that it feels like too much for them. But also, there may be things to do in increasing activity levels, for instance, which will require the parent's concerns or the parent's compliance. 

00:10:45
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  What about when there are lots of problems in the family? 

00:10:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Well, sometimes the depression may be triggered by things that happened to the family before. For instance, uhm, in response to the lost of a parent, for instance. And that may be a historical event, which, uhm, which later triggers on at least the child or the young person becoming depressed. But obviously, sometimes there are families where there are actually a lot of problems at the moment, and sometimes it, that can be one reason why its very important to actually involve the, the parents in the process of therapy. And it may be that the parents need some support themselves as part of a whole treatment package, in addition to the cognitive work that's going on with the young person. But of course, sometimes, there are situations where children are very unpleasant into personal environments of one sort or another. When the child is experiencing essentially emotionally abusive situations at home and essentially what we're looking at there is depression, which is clearly very much related to the experience on a day-to-day basis. And obviously then, we may need, feel that other action needs to be taken to, to safeguard that child's emotional development. 

00:12:00
2 cognitive behavioural therapy treatment programme 

00:12:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The program of therapy we're presenting is brief, lasting about five to eight sessions. It uses a number of different cognitive behavioural techniques which we find useful in our work with adolescents, including some from Cognitive Therapy. The treatment is individual and problem-oriented. It will differ according to the age of the adolescent and to their level of sophistication. The chart shows how the program can be modified to take account of the patient's differing needs. However, for all patients, it's helpful to think it in terms of three stages: starting, middle and ending, which follow the initial assessment. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:12:55
Indications For Use of CBT With Adolescents moderately severe depression as the primary problem child recognizes depression as part of problem Co-morbidity not a contraindication, as long as other problems are being addressed at the same time Contraindications severely impaired very severe conduct disorder dominates the picture 

00:12:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The adolescent would first be given a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a full-mental state examination, family assessment, information from the school, and liaison with other professionals as appropriate. A Cognitive Behavioural Assessment, which then follows, would be designed for two main purposes. The first would be to establish suitability for the treatment, and then to begin to develop a cognitive behavioural formulation. 

00:13:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The approach is suitable for young people with mood disturbances, primarily low mood or depression. In our research, the best response was in young people suffering from a moderately severe depression. The depression needs to be the primary problem and one which the adolescent recognizes, but other problems may also be present. As long as the therapy is not given an isolation and these are the problems that are addressed, co-morbidity is not a contraindication. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy thus has a wide range of applications. However, it's not suitable for young people who are severely impaired by their mood disorder or those with acute suicidal urges, at least until they show some initial improvement. When young people show very severe conduct disorder, working on mood disorder is also unlikely to be helpful. 

00:14:20
CBT 3 cognitive behavioural therapy Demonstration of Cognitive Therapy Techniques 

00:14:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The next section of the video is designed to illustrate some of the main components of our program. In the following scenes, the patients are played by actors, and the therapist by Dr. Alison Wood, Consultant in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for South Manchester University Hospitals, NHS Trust. Although the characters are fictitious, the material is based on situations commonly encountered by Dr. Wood in her clinical practice. We would like emphasize that the scenes are constructed to demonstrate techniques, rather than showing a real therapy situation. 

00:15:15

00:15:15
Emma 

00:15:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  Emma is 15 and lives with hermother, who works full time as an Administrator, and her four, four oldersisters. Herparents separated when Emma was eight and herfather is now remarried with a five year olddaughter. Emma was referred by her GP with symptoms of depression and long term-problems as school refusal. These first showed at the age of nine, when she had difficulty attending her primary school. Hermother found an alternative school but the problems continued. Since moving to a secondary school, a mixed comprehensive, her attendance has been sporadic. She did quite well in the first two years, but has had increasing difficulty since then, leading up to complete school refusal for the month before referral. Emma is bright academically, but has always being shy, and thus found it difficult to make and sustain peer relationships. She has been experiencing extremely low moods, with associated feelings of hopelessness and self-harm. She has cut herself superficially and taken small overdoses on a number of occasions without telling anyone. Other symptoms include poor concentration, anhedonia, low self-esteem, lack of self-confidence and sleep problems. Her mom has found it difficult to bring up five daughters on her own, and has herself suffered from anxiety and depression since herhusband left. This has resulted in her taking quite a lot of time off work over the years. Although she has received support from her GP, she has never felt bad enough to consider psychiatric treatment for her depression. Although Emma feels that she needs help with her problems, it was her mom who persuaded her to come for the first appointment with a psychiatrist. 

00:17:10
ENGAGEMENT 

00:17:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The initial meeting will usually involve the therapist, the young person and theparent. Its important to focus on motivation for help and resistance to treatment at this early stage in the process. During the first meeting with Emma and hermother, the therapist has three main aims: to give Emma the message that treatment if for her to decide to take up, she is in control; to give Emma the opportunity to express her problems individually and to empathize with Emma in her predicaments; and to observe the relationship between Emma and hermother and plan how much to involve Emma'smother in treatment. The therapist sets an agenda for the meeting briefly introducing herself and her role and outlining the steps of the assessment. She gets Emma and hermum to describe briefly what they see as the main problems and difficulties, as well as using this first meeting to explore their motivation for treatment. Emma is very quiet during the interview and initially appears rather silent and angry. She relaxes a little towards the end of the interview, when she sees the therapist on her own. Describing how she feels and able to talk hermum but agreeing with hermum that she needs help. 

00:18:30
DEFINING GOALS OF THERAPY 

00:18:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  A full psychiatric assessment is being completed and Emma has decided to try CBT. The next clip shows the first session of therapy during which goals of therapy are negotiated. Several techniques are demonstrated in this section of video. Collaborative working. Negotiation of individual goals which are specific, within the control of the patient, and open to change. Tackling easier goals first. Encouraging "ownership" of the problems. Rating the severity of the problems at the outset. CBT involves collaborative working and constant negotiation between the therapist and patient. The therapist takes each of Emma's statements and molds them into workable goals. Each goal needs to be as specific as possible so that it will be clear when it is being achieved. For example, it's important to take seriously, Emma's significant difficulties with school and to help her to set the goal of returning to school but to be realistic about that in the context of her other difficulties. Her school problem is clearly chronic and will need to involve other professionals and hermother in overcoming it. The writing down of problems can help adolescents to own them, to feel involved in the planning of treatment and more in control. The use of simple 10-point scales is useful in prioritizing problems and monitoring change. 

00:20:10
The following scenes demonstrate techniques. They are not real therapy situations. Collaborative working rating severity of problems negotiation of individual goals tackling easier goals first encouraging "ownership" of problems 

00:20:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. We'll spend some time talking about how things had been in the last few months and it sounds like things are pretty bad. Uhm, what are the mains things about your life or yourself? What are the things you remember that you'd like to change? 

00:20:25
EMMA  Everything. 

00:20:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Absolutely everything. Well, just trying to separate out things, what do you think was the main area of difficulties? 

00:20:35
EMMA  School. 

00:20:40
DR. ALISON WOOD School. Yeah. You think you can take care about school? 

00:20:45
EMMA Nofriends and I'm always on my own. 

00:20:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, that's a very important one, isn't it? And I can see it's, you know, making you quite upset even talking about it, Emma. Let's think about other things. What, what other things that, uhm, be good to, ah, change? 

00:21:05
EMMA I think of the future. (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
EMMA Uhm. I must think about my future. 

00:21:10
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. And maybe the future just feels like a big black hole, does it? Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
EMMA I think I'm going nowhere. 

00:21:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So that a, a really important area, wasn't it? The way you think about your future, what you feel about your future. Anything else, Emma? 

00:21:25
EMMA I'm just always paranoid. I think people are talking about me and stalking me out.(crosstalk) 

00:21:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
EMMA And I just feel very alone. 

00:21:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. Do you think that's, it affects the way things are going on at school? Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
EMMA So, yeah. 

00:21:40
DR. ALISON WOOD And one thing that strikes me, Emma, is that you seem very low. Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
EMMA Yeah. I'm always depressed all the time. It just feels like it's never gonna end. 

00:21:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. And that's been going on for some time now, doesn't it? Well, we've, we've thought of three or four very important areas there and I think it's such a quite good to, to write those down and, uhm, write them as sort of specific things that you'd like to change, and we think we could talk that through a little bit. And as we do that, I'd like to get some idea about how about each one is. So, if we start with school, Emma, so, you maybe some type in the answer here and if we start with the school problem, imagine there's a scale of not to 10 and where not is not at all and 10 is the worst, ah, problem, is the worst I've ever felt about it. How about the school at the moment? 

00:22:35
EMMA Ten out of ten. 

00:22:35
EMMA  Uhm, catching up with schoolwork and getting on with people and, and enjoying school... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

00:22:55
EMMA ...and things like that. 

00:22:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. Is it going to school? 

00:22:55
EMMA  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Would you like to work towards going back into school? 

00:23:00
EMMA Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. 

00:23:00
EMMA but it's also (inaudible ). 

00:23:04
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, it's really, really important, isn't it? And maybe part of what we're doing today is to decide what order we tackle things 'cause, you know, you need build up your strength before you can do that, U-um? Don't you write it down as number one, Emma? 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  Which one should you do next? 

00:23:30
EMMA  I don't know. Maybe the feelings things about my future. 

00:23:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. That's a really important thing, isn't it? Using the same scale, Emma, what score would you give on that one? 

00:23:40
EMMA  About 8 or 10. It's quite a big one, but not as big as school. 

00:23:45
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. Good. Put that one on the next. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:23:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  And what would you like to put next? 

00:24:00
EMMA  I don't know. Maybe talking to people more and being... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

00:24:05
EMMA ...more pleased about myself, you know, liking myself more. 

00:24:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, is that your confidence to do, then? To do, build, building up your confidence. Ahm, that's really important. How bad is that at the moment? How low is your confidence if, you know, you zero of ten is not having any confidence at all, and ten out of ten is being really confident? 

00:24:25
EMMA Two out of ten. 

00:24:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, can you put that down as number three? 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  And then the last one was an important one, wasn't it, Emma, about your moods? 

00:24:50
EMMA Yeah. 

00:24:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Would you like to feel less depressed, less miserable and sad? 

00:24:55
EMMA Yeah. 

00:24:55
DR. ALISON WOOD How about it at the moment on the same scale, in the zero out to 10 scale? (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
EMMA It's not bad if I don't think about school but, uhm, if I do think about school, then it's really bad to me if it weren't so I think about 6 out of 10. 

00:25:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Great. Won't you put that down? It's number four. That's, that's excellent, Emma. So, what we need to do is to work through these numbers, problems together, ahm, using of some of the techniques and exercises that I'm going to teach you. And, uhm, help you to feel better by about yourself and about your future and to come and to talk about that very difficult problem about school. Okay. 

00:25:40
DEFINING GOALS OF THERAPY Collaborative working Negotiation of individual goals - specific - within control of patient - open to change Tackling easier goals first Encouraging "ownership" of problems Rating severity of problems at outset technique useful early in cognitive therapy 

00:25:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN From the assessment interview and the negotiation of goals of therapy, the therapist will gain increasing insights into the abilities of the patient. Emma is 15 years of age and presents as thoughtful, intelligent, and capable introspection. The next stage is to start using some cognitive techniques. The following clip demonstrates some techniques which are useful early in therapy: presenting rationale for CBT, linking emotions, physical reactions, life stresses, and thoughts, emotional recognition, detection of automatic thoughts, Beck's triad of negative automatic thoughts, setting a homework task 

00:26:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay, Emma. Uhm, we're going to focus on the session today on the dif, different types of feelings that people experience, and this is really linking in with how low you have been feeling and how depressed you have been feeling. Okay, and I think I mentioned a little bit about, uhm, the treatment that we're, we're working through, the cognitive therapy. You heard that word before? No? Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
EMMA No. 

00:27:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Cognitive means thoughts and all of the, all the time we're having different feelings, feeling depressed, feeling happy, there are thoughts going through our minds. And also, bodily reactions happen at the same time. And what we do in this treatment is work on understanding those thoughts, how they link in, with how, how we're feeling, teach, uhm, new ways to modify them so that you feel better, okay. And the way of understanding that is sometimes to think of, uhm, I think as being, as in this diagram. So in your situation, uhm, there are lots of problems at school and, and, uhm, you've had a bad time, you've been bullied and criticized and you found some of the work got hard, and one of the teachers was, was very not very nice to you. 

00:28:00
DR. ALISON WOOD So, these things in, in your life has effect, have affected, uhm, your moods. You've been very low and down. And it also affected your behaviors 'cause you have stopped going into school, you stopped going out with yourfriends, uhm, you started staying in your room a lot and, uhm, avoiding things. And it also affected the way that you feel so that maybe you felt tired and, and run-down and, you know, having headaches. Those are the kind bodily reactions that go along with it. And it amounts to all of this. Ah, lots and lots of thoughts that are going through your head all of the time, and that's what this treatment sort of focuses on. 

00:28:35
Life Situation emotional recognition 

00:28:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, what I want to start off by doing is to ask you to imagine that I've never ever in my whole life felt depressed. And I want you to try and explain and describe how it feels to be depressed. And this is really difficult so, uhm, you know, we can do together a little bit. 

00:28:55
EMMA It's a bad feeling. 

00:28:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah? (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
EMMA Uhm. 

00:29:00
DR. ALISON WOOD It's a very bad feeling, isn't it? 

00:29:00
EMMA Uhm, it makes you angry when you're when you're depressed and... 

00:29:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. It such a very intense feeling inside, isn't it? 

00:29:10
EMMA Yeah. 

00:29:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Anything else? 

00:29:15
EMMA It just hurts a bit to smile. 

00:29:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. It's painful and worse, isn't it? How do you feel in your energy levels? 

00:29:20
EMMA Well, really low. I have no energy when I'm depressed. 

00:29:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Too weak, and tired, and low. Okay, that's excellent. It's really, really difficult to put these feelings into words. Can you remember the last time you felt depressed, Emma? 

00:29:35
EMMA  Last night. 

00:29:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. Okay. When did it come on? Can you remember what you were you doing, where you were? 

00:29:40
EMMA  Uhm, I'm just been on the phone to myfriend Jenny. 

00:29:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. 

00:29:45
EMMA They went (inaudible ). 

00:29:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. Tell me about the phone call. 

00:29:50
EMMA  Jenny told me that afriend called and said if were going out that night... 

00:30:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
EMMA ...and didn't want me to come. 

00:30:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Okay. So, you, you finished the phone call and went up to you room. I want you to imagine, Emma, that your life is on the videotape, okay. 

00:30:10
detection of automatic thoughts 

00:30:10
DR. ALISON WOOD And we can rewind that tape, uhm, to last night and I want you to try and remember all of the thoughts that are going through the, your head at the time you felt really depressed on what happened in your room? 

00:30:20
EMMA I felt like I was useless. I've got no friends. 

00:30:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

00:30:25
EMMA Been a burden. 

00:30:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. 

00:30:25
EMMA  Everyone hated me. 

00:30:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. Anything else, Emma? 

00:30:35
EMMA Lonely. 

00:30:35
DR. ALISON WOOD That's excellent. It's really difficult to, to remember them. And that's what this treatment helps you do, okay. Now, I'd like to, uhm, move on from that feeling 'cause that was a very unpleasant feeling, wasn't it, Emma? I guess even talking about it now has made you feel quite fed up and down, hasn't it? 

00:30:55
EMMA Yeah. 

00:30:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Yes. So let's, let's focus on a different type of feeling. Why don't you try to remember for me the last time you felt, uhm, happy and excited? 

00:31:00
EMMA  Last weekend. 

00:31:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay? Tell me where you were and what you were doing. 

00:31:10
EMMA I went shopping with myfriends and we went to eat at McDonald's and we had really a good fun. It was great. 

00:31:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. And how did you feel? Imagine I've never felt like that, what would it feel like? 

00:31:20
EMMA I was really grateful that I got friends like that and planning my evening out. "We're going to a club afterwards," you say. 

00:31:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  Brilliant. So, those were some of the thoughts that were going through your head, uhm, when you felt really happy. How did it feel in, in your body to be happy and excited? 

00:31:35
EMMA Uhm, I felt really hyperactive and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

00:31:40
EMMA ...really pleased and, uh, sort of feeling, well, and I didn't feel low anymore. 

00:31:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Loads of energy? 

00:31:45
EMMA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Is that a warm, kind of a nice... 

00:31:50
EMMA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
DR. ALISON WOOD ...warm feeling, pleasant feeling? Okay. And the thoughts that were going through head were thoughts about yourfriends and the future. 

00:31:55
EMMA Yeah. 

00:31:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  And, uhm, generally positive thoughts, is that right, Emma? 

00:32:00
EMMA Yeah. 

00:32:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. So, it's very different, isn't it, from the previous, uhm, example that you gave when you're feeling down and low. And it would come as a surprise to you that there's an important link- 

00:32:10
triad of negative automatic thoughts 

00:32:10
DR. ALISON WOOD - between the thoughts going through your mind and how you feel. And, and in an example you gave when you felt really low and depressed. You're having negative thought, weren't you, Emma, thinking about bad things about yourself and useless and hopeless? Thinking your bad thoughts about the future and never having any friends, uhm, nothing's ever gonna change for me. You're having bad thoughts, ah, about the way things are, you know, that everyone is ignoring me and nobody wants to go out with me. And what we're doing in the treatment is getting more sort of skilled at spotting those thoughts and then, uhm, being able to deal with them 'cause sometimes, they're not 100 percent fair and rational. Okay. So, what I'd like you to do for me this week is a little bit of homework Emma, and, uhm, have you ever kept a diary? 

00:33:00
setting homework task 

00:33:00
EMMA I used to when I was younger but mysisters always used to read that. 

00:33:05
DR. ALISON WOOD I know, some one, somebody reading it? So, uhm, eh, eh, what I'd like you to do is keep a, a diary which has got to be personal diary for you. It's not something that yourmum's gonna nag you to do, and it's something you need to probably keep on you so that you, uhm, you know, can avoid yoursisters, uhm, reading it 'coz it, ah, you might need to write some quite private things in it. Now, what, what I would like you to do each day for me, Emma, is divide up the page, a bit like this. So, in the same way that we've done today, I want you to make some notes about, uhm, what was going on, where you were, and the time of day, and the mood times 'coz this is a recording of times when you feel really low and depressed. So, tell me what was happening at that time, and you tell me about your mood. Uhm, and like we did in the first session, I'd would like you to give it a rating, you know, naught out of ten. So, the mood you described to me just now, how would you rate that one, that depressed mood? 

00:34:00
EMMA About, about a nine. 

00:34:00
DR. ALISON WOOD About a nine out of 10. Excellent. So, you put the figure out of 10 and, and you might have a variety of moods. You might feel angry, you might feel depressed, you might feel lonely. And for each of them, if you rate naught to 10. And this is a very important, uhm, column, and what I want you to do here, Emma, is to actually write down all of those thoughts that were going through your head at the time you felt angry or depressed or, uhm, anxious or worried, okay? And that's a really difficult one and that gets easier as you sort of practice it, okay? It's best to do that, uhm, as the moods occur but obviously, you know, if you're, uhm, out somewhere, it might not be possible so you can do it last moment, before you go to bed, right? (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
EMMA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
DR. ALISON WOOD And I'm gonna you give your own diary to do that in, which you can divide the, uhm, pages up into columns for me. And then, when you come, when you come next time, we can go through it and, and talk about some of the moods that you having and, and sort of examine it a little bit closer. So, okay, Emma, do you have any questions? 

00:35:05
EMMA That's fine. It looks a bit difficult but I'd be able to do it. 

00:35:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Excellent. Okay, try your hardest and, uhm, if there are problems, we can go though them next time. 

00:35:15
EMMA Okay. 

00:35:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN In summary, emotional recognition is a useful way in, to eliciting automatic thoughts. The moods, actions and thoughts diary will give further information about the effectiveness of cognitive approaches at this stage of treatment. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The following section of video demonstrates activity scheduling, a behavioural technique which is useful early in treatment. Depressed adolescents lack motivation and who often dropped out of previously enjoyed activities and relationships. Emma has described her difficulties with school and it can be anticipated that she's spending a lot of time on her own with nothing to do. It is helpful to involve the parents in this session as many depressed adolescents will need the support of their parents in making these changes. The following aspects of activity scheduling are demonstrated: review of progress, linking inactivity with depressed moods, use of activity schedule to assesses periods of inactivity. 

00:36:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  I think it'll be helpful if we work together at this point. Emma and I have met three or four times now and, uhm, I thought we could (inaudible ) to sort of see how things are going. (crosstalk) 

00:36:36
review of progress 

00:36:36
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:36:36
DR. ALISON WOOD What do you think she is getting on, Mrs. Gray? 

00:36:40
MRS. GRAY Well, I've noticed there's a quite a change. She's she seems much brighter... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
MRS. GRAY ...not I see her that much 'coz, uh, (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
MRS. GRAY you know, she still spend a lot of... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
DR. ALISON WOOD So. (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
MRS. GRAY ...time in a room. But she, she does seem much more sort of positive about things. 

00:36:55
DR. ALISON WOOD That's excellent. That's, that's good. Emma must be working really hard. 

00:36:55
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. 

00:36:55
linking inactivity with depressed moods 

00:36:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  And, uhm, you know, I was wondering if you had noticed, Emma, but, uhm, you tend to feel worse when you're bored or, you know, you got nothing to do, hanging on the house, doing nothing 'coz you do have quite a lot of time on your hands at the moment, don't you? 

00:37:10
EMMA Yeah. I get really lonely even for a moment where I'm out sometimes. 

00:37:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Okay. 'Coz you, you have a lot of time during the day, uh, on your own, don't you, Emma? 

00:37:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The middle part of this session which is omitted on the clip is spent talking about school. Emma and hermother agree that a meeting with the head of year would be a useful first step. 

00:37:35
[sil.] 

00:37:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  How about, you know, the things between you? Do you spend much time together? You've already said that you hardly see Emma, (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
MRS. GRAY Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:37:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Mrs. Gray(ph), do you, do you fairly, you know, do you do many things together? 

00:37:50
DR. ALISON WOOD We used to, didn't we? I mean we used to go shopping, and occasional film. I didn't know anything about it. 

00:37:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

00:37:55
MRS. GRAY But not, not now. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
EMMA  You're always at work, though. 

00:38:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. (inaudible ) and that somehow you work hard on... (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
MRS. GRAY I know. (crosstalk) 

00:38:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and you've got a stressful job, but when was the last time you interact together? 

00:38:05
MRS. GRAY  Months ago. 

00:38:10
DR. ALISON WOOD How did it go? Remember, Emma? 

00:38:15
EMMA No. 

00:38:15
MRS. GRAY Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
EMMA And I. (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
MRS. GRAY I mean, I, I, you know, I don't, I don't get that much time off work but, uh, I'm gonna keep myfamily so I don't have no much choice in that. 

00:38:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Showing difficulties... (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
MRS. GRAY But. (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
DR. ALISON WOOD ...with hersisters, too. And, uhm, but I think it is important that, uhm, you know, you just spend some time together and, uhm, what I want you to do today is to self -explain, uhm, a task that I'd like to you give for the next week and it was been brilliant to, to obtain her, her diary and... (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
MRS. GRAY Uh hmm. 

00:38:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ...her exercises and, uh,- 

00:38:45
use of activity schedule to assess periods of inactivity 

00:38:45
DR. ALISON WOOD - I've got, uh, another chart that I'm gonna show in which is, uhm, it's, it's a time table really for you to record for me, uhm, all the things you do over the course of the day. So, each, each day is written is in, uhm, a column and then each hour is done inside, okay? And it's a bit boring doing this but it's actually quite interesting because sometimes you think, I have nothing today but if you actually write it, write what you have done, you have actually, uh, done things that don't you sort of remember. So, uhm, I'd like you to fill this in but I was wondering whether you could think of, uhm, things that Emma could do to keep herself occupied, uhm, during the day? 

00:39:25
MRS. GRAY Well, she could tidy her room for a start. (laughs) 

00:39:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  Uh-huh. Okay. Sort of a bit of burned(ph) contention between you. 

00:39:30
MRS. GRAY Well, yes it has been, yes. 

00:39:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Are there other things that perhaps would be, uhm, less chore-like or, uh, less, uhm, have a contention between you that you could perhaps think of Emma helping you with or... 

00:39:50
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. 

00:39:50
DR. ALISON WOOD ...doing? 

00:39:50
MRS. GRAY Well, I was thinking of doing with, uh, decorating. I don't know how Emma feels about... 

00:39:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Well, that'll be good. 

00:39:55
MRS. GRAY ...painting maybe. (laughs) 

00:39:55
DR. ALISON WOOD What do you think of it, Emma? 

00:40:00
EMMA I'll think about it. 

00:40:00
DR. ALISON WOOD I think that'll be good. 

00:40:00
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. 

00:40:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Isn't probably that you can perhaps, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:40:05
DR. ALISON WOOD spend some time talking about this. And uhm, the first stage there stage Emma, is to make some notes for me about what you do, spend your time doing. And then uhm, we can take this up a little bit further. 

00:40:15
MRS. GRAY Uh-huh. 

00:40:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The homework task of monitoring her activities during the following week will serve as a prelude to planning and scheduling activities for the empty parts of the day. 

00:40:25
cognitive restructuring 

00:40:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  This section of the video demonstrates some more advanced cognitive techniques. These techniques are often difficult to work through with adolescents, and only the more mature and cognitively sophisticated will find them useful. 

00:40:45
cognitive restructuring techniques 

00:40:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The clip demonstrates the following: Self monitoring, eliciting negative automatic thoughts determining the "hot" thought, downward arrow technique, eliciting dysfunctional assumptions examining the evidence, use of a thought record, developing a cognitive formulation of depression. In practice these techniques need to be developed over a few sessions working at the pace of the adolescent. The use of charts, handouts, and diagrams is most helpful. Teenagers can become quickly overwhelmed and to avoid any failure experiences, it is helpful to rehearse homework tasks in the session and constantly explore cognitions related to them. 

00:41:40
DR. ALISON WOOD  Hello Emma. Uhm, so far in, in the treatment, we've concentrated on the kind of thoughts that you have when you feel low and fed up and depressed. And, and what I want to do today is to move on to understand these thoughts a little bit and work out where they're coming from. I see you got your diary there. What kind of a week did you have? 

00:42:00
EMMA Well, I had... (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Thanks. (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
EMMA ...three- 

00:42:00
self monitoring 

00:42:00
EMMA  low moments, and uh, a big argument with mymum. But I find it real hard to writing it down in the diary... (Crosstalk) 

00:42:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
EMMA ...it just makes the feelings even worst. 

00:42:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  'Coz it makes you feel worse writing in your diary? Okay. Have you persisted with that? And you know, uhm, 'coz I think I explained that it does sometimes happen when you start. 

00:42:20
EMMA Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Uhm, can you been able to write some, some things down for me? 

00:42:25
EMMA Yeah. 

00:42:25
DR. ALISON WOOD I see. Can I have a look? Really? That's brilliant and uhm, excellent! So, uhm, you've written down, you've actually described really three fine moments that you've had in the last, ah, week or so. What I'd like you to do is just pick one of them, okay? Which was the worst? 

00:42:45
EMMA Probably on Tuesday night. 

00:42:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Uh, I see, I find it in your diary. Is that the one where, uhm, you were at Jenny's? 

00:42:50
EMMA Yeah. I just come home from Jenny's. 

00:42:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Talk me through what happened just, sort of briefly. 

00:42:55
EMMA I was at Jenny's and then Claire arrived. They started talking, left me out completely and so I just came home again, uh-huh. 

00:43:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Hmm, so you were really quite upset and you put in the diary that, that you, you were depressed when you got home. 

00:43:10
EMMA Yeah. 

00:43:10
DR. ALISON WOOD And that was just 9 out 10 you were and you were angry as well. And, ah, I guess you were angry with them, yourfriend arriving and sort of butting in there. 

00:43:20
EMMA Yeah. 

00:43:20
DR. ALISON WOOD And also you were very lonely. Okay. And then, this is really, really good, Emma. In your, in your confidence for writing down your thoughts, you've written down- 

00:43:30
eliciting negative automatic thoughts 

00:43:30
DR. ALISON WOOD - the thoughts that are going through your head as being "I'm different, I don't fit in, they don't understand me, I'm abnormal, they just want me to go home so they can talk about me." Okay. Which of those, do you think, is the, the really important- 

00:43:45
determining the "hot" thought 

00:43:45
DR. ALISON WOOD - uh, thought that linked in with you feeling so low and angry and lonely? 

00:43:50
EMMA I'm different. I don't fit in. 

00:43:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, I think we need to focus a little bit today, ah, Emma. I certainly can understand where it comes from. And importantly, let's see if we can find ways of dealing with it 'coz I think you got quite a lot, don't you? 

00:44:05
EMMA Yeah. 

00:44:05
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah. And I can certainly see from the diary that it figured in the other moods that you had too. So, let's sort of think about that a little bit, ah, that thought, "I don't fit in, I'm outsider." What does it mean to be an "outsider"? 

00:44:20
EMMA  I'm all alone. Uhm,- 

00:44:25
downward arrow technique 

00:44:25
EMMA - I feel isolated. I'm mad with the world. 

00:44:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. What does it mean to you to be "isolated"? 

00:44:30
EMMA  I've got no friends. Uhm, no one loves me. 

00:44:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. What does it mean to think that nobody loves you. 

00:44:45
EMMA It's really hard. I've never really had relationship with people. I don't get along with people very well; boyfriend in ages. I just feel trapped, you know. No one likes me and. 

00:45:00
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay, that's excellent, Emma. So, your, your thoughts go sort of deeper and deeper down to the one which says that maybe- 

00:45:10
eliciting dysfunctional assumptions 

00:45:10
DR. ALISON WOOD you're unlovable and nobody wants to have a relationship with you and you're going to stay on your own forever and ever and ever. Does that such a bit how it goes, or was it a different now? 

00:45:20
EMMA  It's about right, yeah. No one kinda likes me anymore. 

00:45:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, I think it's important to, to look at that thought or belief you've got, and that you're not sadder and you're unlovable because it, it may be that that's not really uh, you know, fair and rational. Do you any evidence- 

00:45:45
examining the evidence 

00:45:45
DR. ALISON WOOD -Emma, for not being true that you are unlovable. 

00:45:50
EMMA People don't speak to me. I'm always on my own. 

00:45:50
DR. ALISON WOOD  Is that all the time? 

00:45:55
EMMA Well, most of the time, anyway. 

00:46:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Imagine yourfriend,best friend said to you, "I'm unlovable, everybody hates me," what do you say to her? 

00:46:05
EMMA  I'd say, she's being stupid, that I liked her, and this wasn't true. 

00:46:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. What about the times when you don't feel like that. Can you, remember a time when you didn't have that thought. 

00:46:25
EMMA No, I suppose not. 

00:46:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  You can't remember the time you talked before during the last time when you went to, uhm, McDonald's with yourfriends. Did you have that thought then? 

00:46:35
EMMA  Sometimes, I did felt but, I was really happy then. We went to McDonalds, it was really good fun. 

00:46:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. And you went to McDonald's with some friends. 

00:46:50
EMMA Yeah. 

00:46:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? So, if you're truly unlovable and, uhm, your, your beliefs are true, do you think you'd have friends that will be able to go to McDonald's with you and have a good time with you? 

00:47:00
EMMA  I suppose not. 

00:47:05
DR. ALISON WOOD And if you're truly unlovable do you think you'd be among that and would like to do things with you and wants to, uhm, help you out as much as she can? 

00:47:15
EMMA I suppose not. 

00:47:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, do you think that there might be some times where you don't believe that to be true. 

00:47:25
EMMA  Sometimes. 

00:47:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Hmm. But at the moment, uh, less often then than the times when you believed it to be true, aren't they? 

00:47:35
EMMA Yeah. 

00:47:35
DR. ALISON WOOD And Emma, but the purpose of, of thinking the through like this, is to challenge us a little bit and think well and perhaps have to make you feel when you believe you are unlovable and isolated and not have relationship? 

00:47:50
EMMA Makes me feel really depressed and it also feels, it's really about feeling. 

00:48:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. So, if you could challenge that belief, it might make you feel better, wouldn't it? 

00:48:05
EMMA Yeah. 

00:48:05
DR. ALISON WOOD  So, I'd like you to a, do some homework for me again this week, Emma. Okay, and let's continue with what we've been working through in this session. So, what I'd like you to do, I'm going to give you some of these charts, uhm, to go- 

00:48:20
use of a thoughts record 

00:48:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  within your diary and we've got several columns here, that, just like before, the first few are when and where and how you were feeling; what was going on. And this one is for the thoughts that went through the, through your head at the time. So, those are what you have been writing down in your diary for the last week. And then, what we're going to do now is to actually challenge those thoughts. So, in the same way as I've asked you, well, what's the evidence there? And you, you're being unlovable and, uhm, nobody liking you, you have to think that through and you have to write the evidence for those being true, and also the evidence against them. And then you have to come up with an alternative, more balanced thought and that might be something like, well, uhm, "There are times when I feel I haven't got any friends and I'm unlovable. But there are other times when I know that I have and enjoy being with my friends and I know that my family loves me." Okay? And then, there's a column here for you to rate how much you believe your balance thought, versus how much you believe your automatic thought. Okay? It's a little bit complicated. How do feel about filling it out, Emma? 

00:49:30
EMMA  It's quite difficult. 

00:49:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
EMMA But it should be alright. Thinking of these thoughts without believing. 

00:49:40
DR. ALISON WOOD I think, that's a very important uhm,- 

00:49:40
developing a cognitive formulation of depression 

00:49:40
DR. ALISON WOOD - point you had there, 'cause what happens is that the kind of thoughts you had all the time and the kind of superficial thoughts and that often uhm, rooted in beliefs. And uh, the kind of things are affecting you today, which, ah, quite often come from things that happen to you in the past. And I'm sure that yourdad leaving when you're little was really important, and I guess it's something you think about quite often, isn't it, Emma? I think much of it is something we can explore a bit more uhm, because I'm sure you're right, relatives are important.

00:50:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Towards the end of this session, Emma linked her beliefs that she is unlovable with her early experience of rejection by herfather. It may be helpful in further sessions to go on to develop a cognitive formulation linking these together as a diagram.

00:50:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  It's possible to build up this sort of diagram as an aid to understanding how beliefs are formed and triggered, and how they relate to automatic thoughts and to symptoms of depression. Emma's early experience of herfather leaving resulted in a belief that she was unlovable. These assumptions were reactivated by rejections byfriends and bullying at school results in thoughts and symptoms she described during therapy.

social problem solving 

00:51:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  This segment of the video demonstrates the Dr. Alison Wood and Emma working through the steps of the problem solving process together, or use a hand out describing the steps. Seven steps to solving the problems: define the problem, brainstorm to generate possible solutions, focus energy and attention on the task, project the outcome of each of the possible solutions, weigh the consequences and choose a solution, evaluate the outcome of the chosen action, give yourself a reward for success or try one of the other possible solutions. 

00:51:50
DR. ALISON WOOD  Uhm, what we're going to do today is focus on some, some problem solving. Ahm, my impression is, from what we've, uhm, talked about so far, that some of your loneliness had something to do to do with going out withfriends, or any problems which occur, and, you know, which are quite common problems. Do you think that's fair? 

00:52:10
EMMA  Yeah. 

00:52:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah, okay. 

00:52:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Let me see your diary? Have you been filling it in for the last week for me? 

00:52:15
EMMA Yeah. 

00:52:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Excellent. We just have a, a little of, right. So, and not to fight. It, it's in your diary that you fell out with, uhm, Jenny on Monday. 

00:52:30
EMMA Yeah. 

00:52:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Do you want to tell me what happened? 

00:52:30
EMMA Uhm, I understand she been talking about me with some other girl. 

00:52:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

00:52:35
EMMA She, I asked about it but she denied it. I didn't believe her. 

00:52:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So, what happened? 

00:52:40
EMMA  Hmm, but we've stopped it now. We're just not talking. I'm not talking to either of them. 

00:52:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. Sort of (inaudible ), (crosstalk) 

00:52:50
EMMA Yeah. 

00:52:50
DR. ALISON WOOD you've been to with not spending. That happened on Monday...(crosstalk) 

00:52:50
EMMA Yeah. 

00:52:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Emma, okay. What we are going to do today, is to work through some steps and perhaps solve problems. And, uhm, let me, I should give you a handout here, Emma, ah, which we are going to go through in the session today. And this is the seven steps to solving problems. Have you seen that before? 

00:53:05
EMMA  No. (crosstalk) 

00:53:10
DR. ALISON WOOD No. Okay. So, just read out number one for me. 

00:53:10
EMMA Define the problem. 

00:53:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, what's the problem here? 

00:53:15
EMMA How to deal with an argument with mybest friend? 

00:53:20
DR. ALISON WOOD (laughs) Ahm, it's of importance, isn't it, to think that through because my guess is that you'd like to make up. Is that, is that right? 

00:53:25
EMMA Yeah. 

00:53:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah, okay. What, what's number two, Emma? 

00:53:30
EMMA Hmm, brainstorm to gen, to generate possible solutions. 

00:53:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. So, what we have to do is to think of all the possible ways, uh, you can, and I can think of solving that problem, and they can be, they can range from being, you know, sensible to and not being sensible. And the idea is to get about six or seven so that we can then move through to the next step. So, what would you do? Falling out with yourbest friend, what, what are your options? 

00:53:55
EMMA We got, I mean the girls can't be (inaudible ) someday. 

00:53:58
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay, brilliant! I'm going to have to write them down so you'll remember them. So, the first one is, what was it? 

00:54:05
EMMA Going to another girl to beat her up. 

00:54:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay, go to another girl to beat her up. Brilliant, okay. What else? 

00:54:10
EMMA I could apologize. 

00:54:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Good. Yeah? Any others? 

00:54:20
EMMA Uhm, could get mymum's phone her mum 

00:54:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. This is excellent, Emma, to phone her mum. Here? Uh-hum. 

00:54:30
EMMA  Write her a letter. 

00:54:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Very good. And, we have a few now. We've got four. Another couple and you should have done really well, actually. You, any, in any situation, you should not choose to do nothing. 

00:54:50
EMMA  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
DR. ALISON WOOD So, that would mean... (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
EMMA ...just leaving, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:54:55
DR. ALISON WOOD ...just leaving it, wouldn't it? Yeah. Uhm, anything else? We have probably covered the major ones there, Emma. Did we? 

00:55:10
EMMA No. 

00:55:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. That's great. We've got five end options there. Read out the next step on the problem solving. 

00:55:20
EMMA Focus energy and attention on the task. 

00:55:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Welcome it. (laughs) 

00:55:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  That's why we did that. That was on the brainstorming so that you can get loads and loads of options. But I think, you know, five is plenty. What's, what's it say next. 

00:55:30
EMMA Project the outcome of each possible solution. 

00:55:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, we're gonna practice and, uh, with one of them. So, which one of those would you like to pick so that we can, ah, examine it a bit more closely. 

00:55:45
EMMA Apologizing. 

00:55:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. What are the advantages, Emma, and what would that involve apologizing? 

00:55:50
EMMA  Well, I wouldn't apologize. I just won't do it. 

00:55:55
DR. ALISON WOOD This, mentioned data what, what would it involve? 

00:56:00
EMMA Uhm, I've to phone her up and I'd apologize and maybe she'd apologize, at least talk about it. 

00:56:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, the advantages are, that. (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
EMMA You get some things solved. 

00:56:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. You'd be able to talk about it, yeah. Any other advantages of that one? 

00:56:20
EMMA  Well, maybe if we did talk about it then, we might befriends again. 

00:56:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay, we have to make friends, yeah? 'Cause that's what you would want to achieve and face this now. All right. So that, well on the face, a bit looks like it's solved quite a lot going for it. What, what are the disadvantages of that one? 

00:56:40
EMMA If I apologize, then it might seem like she's getting away with it and it will happen again. 

00:56:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So, you, you'd, you'd feel like you were admitting you were wrong, (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
EMMA Yeah. 

00:56:50
DR. ALISON WOOD and after the fight, it seems like, you know, each of you had a part to play in what went wrong. Yeah, so you'd be admitting you are wrong. And you think that if you did that, you know, next time it happened, (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
EMMA Uh hmm. 

00:57:00
DR. ALISON WOOD  she might just wait for you to apologize instead of being a better, actually, own some responsibility for it. What are the other dis, disadvantages about just apologizing? 

00:57:10
EMMA  Definitely make it easier for her but if it ever happens again, know that I just apologize. 

00:57:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Absolutely. How easy would it be to apologize, Emma? 

00:57:20
EMMA  Quite hard. 

00:57:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Hmm. Could you imagine yourself doing that? 

00:57:25
EMMA  With a bit of thoughts, probably. 

00:57:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. That's, that's good coz it's, it's the hardest in the world, isn't it? It gives a nightmare sometimes. See, see what we've done. We've talked about the pros and cons of one of your options, apologizing. And we need to do that for all of them. But just because we are working through your handout, let's move on to the next step. So, what's the next step, Emma? 

00:57:50
EMMA Uhm, see what happens. 

00:57:50
experimentation 

00:57:50
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, we'd have to, uhm, put that into practice as a little experiment? You'd need to apologize and you'd see what was the result. And, uh, if it worked, well, that's great. You've, uhm, solved your problem. If it didn't work, you could perhaps, pick one or the other options that you, ah, went through to see if that worked better. And what's the final step, Emma? 

00:58:15
EMMA Give yourself a reward. 

00:58:15
DR. ALISON WOOD okay. So what reward are you gonna give yourself? 

00:58:15
EMMA  To, like, get a chocolate bar but I'll get even fatter. 

00:58:20
DR. ALISON WOOD (laughs) Okay, okay. And so, what we've done today is, uhm, worked through the seven steps of problem solving, and I'd like you to take that handout home with you and, uhm, put that into practice so when you come across a problem, in the next week, I'd like you to sit down with a paper and pencil with your diary and actually work through those steps. And, and be a little bit imaginative and, uh, make yourself laugh a bit. Uh, it's quite good fun. You'll never know, yourfriends might learn something, too. 

00:58:50
ending CBT 

00:58:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  We've demonstrated some cognitive techniques, some behavioural techniques, and some social skills techniques with Emma. We're now going to move on to the end of therapy. The final short tape demonstrates the following: Review of progress and feedback, setting agendas, summarising, eliciting helpful strategies, prediction of future problems, responsibility for recovery. 

00:59:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uhm, we've been together at least for seven sessions is it now, I think? Ah, how do you feel it's going? 

00:59:50
review of progress, feedback 

00:59:50
EMMA  It's going to be a while. I believe I can see the improvement in myself. Ahm... (crosstalk) 

00:59:55
DR. ALISON WOOD That's excellent. Has yourmum noticed the improvement too? 

01:00:00
EMMA Yeah. She's really pleased. 

01:00:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. So, what we need to do today is to think about what's gonna helpf you better, uhm, decide whether we will need to carry on a meeting, or whether we could have perhaps, longer breaks between the sessions and- 

01:00:10
setting agendas 

01:00:10
DR. ALISON WOOD - uhm, in fact what we are going to do in the future, you know, if things go bad again 'coz you started school now, haven't you? And although you're not in full time and you've managed to, uh, go in for a half, half days for the whole week, which is brilliant, you never thought you'd do that, would you? 

01:00:25
EMMA No. 

01:00:25
eliciting helpful strategies 

01:00:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. What, what do you think has been helpful about the treatment? 

01:00:30
EMMA Writing my diary and talking to you about everything. 

01:00:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. I know you've been keeping a diary for the last week, yeah? 

01:00:35
EMMA Yeah. 

01:00:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Have you, how have you been feeling in the last week, Emma? 

01:00:40
EMMA Not been depressed. Uhm, been feeling a lot better with myself as well. 

01:00:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. That's excellent news. So, what's helped you about writing a diary, do you think? 

01:00:50
EMMA Been able to, to recall my feelings and look back on them... (crosstalk) 

01:00:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:00:55
EMMA ...and sort them out properly. 

01:00:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  Uh hmm. And all the work we did on your thoughts and your beliefs, do you think that was helpful? 

01:01:05
EMMA Definitely, yes... (crosstalk) 

01:01:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:01:05
EMMA ... especially the tables. 

01:01:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The therapist then gets Emma to think about what she would do if she became depressed in the future. Encouraging her to identify areas of potential difficulty and to rehearse strategies in advance. She stresses how Emma now has a range of skills and techniques which she can fall upon when faced with low moods in the future. The therapist will continue to review Emma's progress over the next couple of months, increasing the time between sessions. Treatment does not always go smoothly. We frequently find that adolescents recover very quickly and once their mood is lifted, it becomes difficult to continue to work through ongoing difficulties or to look at future relapses. 

01:01:50

01:01:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  Neil is much younger than Emma, having only recently started secondary school. He lives at home with bothparents. His olderbrother, Paul, died of a (inaudible ) at the age of four months. Hisdad worked long hours as an engineer, while hismum, who has not worked since Neil was born, has taken the main parenting role. As a family, they're fairly isolated, with few friends and little social support, although church plays an important part in their lives. Neil'smum had a depressive illness during adolescence, for which she received no treatment and does have periods of feeling very lonely at times throughout her life. She feels that she never grieved for Paul's death and suffered a significant depression when Neil was very young, finding Neil very difficult to relate to at this time. She has never wanted medical treatment for depression but has received some counseling through her local church. Neil'smum anddad have experienced many difficulties in their relationship and did consider separating. After going for marital counseling, they decided to stay together for Neil's sake. Neil was referred by the consultant pediatrician, after extensive investigations for finding terms which he and hisparents accepted due to anxiety and panic. Hisparents describe him as an intelligent boy who is extremely sensitive and lacked confidence. He has always being rather shy and inhibited, finding it difficult to make friends and being the victim of bullying while at primary school. He was devastated when hisbest friend moved out of the area at of end of primary school and has become increasingly unhappy since starting at an all-boy grammar school two months ago. He is preoccupied with thoughts about the loss of hisfriend, Chris. His sleep and appetite are badly affected and his concentration poor. At home, he isolates himself in his bedroom. He has frequent thoughts of self-harm but is not acted on these. 

01:04:00
intro introduction to CBT 

01:04:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The first scene shows the therapist, Neil and hismother meeting for their appointments after Neil's initial psychiatric assessments. There are important differences in engaging Neil in CBT in comparison with Emma which are related to his younger age in male sex. The first short clip demonstrates the following: definition of CBT, need to increase parental involvement, less resistance to treatment. The explanation of treatment needs to be focused on the patient's background and understanding. In contrast to Emma, Neil is quite open in the presence of hismother and looks to her for help when answering questions. Younger adolescent boys often lack sophisticated verbal skills, which can be a block to treatment. 

01:04:55
The following scenes demonstrate techniques. They are not real therapy situations. 

01:04:55
DR. ALISON WOOD So, having heard a bit of your problems, Neil, it sounds like you're very depressed. 

01:05:00
NEIL Hmm. 

01:05:00
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah. Uhm, I think what might help is, uh, a special sort of, sort of talking treatment that we do with teenagers here which is called Cognitive Therapy. You probably heard of that? 

01:05:10
NEIL  No. 

01:05:15
DR. ALISON WOOD No? Have you heard of it, Mrs. (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

01:05:17
 Well, I have, I have, I don't really know what it means. 

01:05:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Right, okay. It's fair enough. Cognitive, uh, the word means thoughts and beliefs and that the aim for his talking, his talking, uhm the aim is to actually find out the kind of thoughts that go through people's minds when they feel very depressed and low, and teach them ways and of handling those thoughts, understanding them and working on them. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
MOTHER Uh hmm. 

01:05:40
DR. ALISON WOOD And, uhm, it's, it can be very, very helpful. And the way we do it is it will involve me meeting with Neil, uhm, usually once a week to start with through, uhm, a few times. (crosstalk) 

01:05:50
MOTHER Uh hmm. 

01:05:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Usually, it takes between four and eight meetings. And then alongside that every usually three or four times, we have a, a joint me4eting with us all together. And usually, at the end each meeting, we're bringing mum in there sort of to check out how things have been over the last week. 

01:06:00
NEIL  Hmm. 

01:06:05
DR. ALISON WOOD So, how does that sound? 

01:06:05
MOTHER So, normally, it would just be Neil but you talked to me his (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

01:06:12
DR. ALISON WOOD It's mainly with Neil but because it so important that, you now, you live together and you're the one that knows Neil best... (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
 Uh hmm. 

01:06:15
DR. ALISON WOOD ...we would very much involve you. (crosstalk) 

01:06:15
MOTHER Oh, me. 

01:06:15
DR. ALISON WOOD And usually, that would be the end of the session. But it would kind of depend,- (crosstalk) 

01:06:20
MOTHER Uh hmm. 

01:06:20
DR. ALISON WOOD - you know, how things go really. So, just a thinking out through a little bit now, when you feel really low and depressed and sad, can you remember some of the thoughts that go through your head? 

01:06:30
NEIL Thinking about Chris. 

01:06:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. 

01:06:35
NEIL I miss him. 

01:06:35
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. That's been very hard, wasn't it? (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
MOTHER Hmm, yes. 

01:06:40
DR. ALISON WOOD And, uhm, I think, that's something that's very important to think... (crosstalk) 

01:06:40
MOTHER Hmm. 

01:06:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ...through and, uh, help, help Neil with. 

01:06:45
MOTHER Uh hmm. Okay. 

01:06:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The next clip shows Neil and the therapist negotiating goals of therapy. Goals of therapy with depressed adolescents often seem over-simplistic and boil down to statements such as, "to feel less depressed, to increase my self-confidence." These do seem to provide a helpful starting point. This clip demonstrates the following: checking resistance to treatment, generating simple goals which are within the patient's control, eliciting imagery, the therapist taking a more directive stance, rating severity of goals. 

01:07:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  So, hello, Neil? (crosstalk) 

01:07:35
NEIL Hi. 

01:07:35
DR. ALISON WOOD How did you feel about coming along for this treatment. 

01:07:40
checking resistance to treatment 

01:07:40
NEIL Uh, I was bit nervous and I don't know if I can do it. 

01:07:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Well, that's fine. A lot of people actually feel that way, and, uhm, (inaudible ) is an experiment. You know, we don't know if it's gonna work, uhm, but I think it's important that we give it a try and see how it goes. And if you all find it too difficult, you know, I want you go ahead, you can tell me and we'll sort of change the, the way we're working. And to make things work, we're working together as a team to try and make things better for you. Okay? 

01:08:05
NEIL Yeah. 

01:08:05
DR. ALISON WOOD So, what I want you to do, do today is to sort of find- 

01:08:10
generating simple goals 

01:08:10
DR. ALISON WOOD - out a bit about the main areas that you'd like to change about the way things are for you at the moment. So, anything that, eh, what, what comes out as being the sort of most important, uhm, area that you'd like to change or work on. 

01:08:25
NEIL Uhm, I want to not to try and changing me, being upset all the time and... (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. 

01:08:30
NEIL ...being unhappy. 

01:08:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay, that's obviously really important. (crosstalk) 

01:08:30
NEIL  Yeah. 

01:08:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Isn't it Neil, and I guess you feel upset most of the time, do you? 

01:08:35
NEIL Yeah. 

01:08:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. And that's different from your normal self, is it, yeah? And we've talked quite a lot about how important Chris is and all that. Uhm, is there anything else involved in you being upset and unhappy? 

01:08:50
NEIL I wish I could go out there... (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:08:50
NEIL ...sort of being a bit too small all the time... (crosstalk) 

01:08:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:08:55
NEIL ...and get picked on at school. 

01:08:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, it's a bit about your appearance. Uhm, anything else, Neil, that's on your mind? 

01:09:00
NEIL  I've got no friends, really. Nobody. (crosstalk) 

01:09:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, those are the three things that are quite often on your mind when you feel, when you're unhappy. Now, there are also some things that we can't change by the talking treatment, uhm, and we really can make it better because that would, that would be too difficult. Uhm, but, I think, we, we could work on your feeling less upset and maybe we could work on the upset feelings you have about Chris. Is, is that something that's quite important when you're upset? 

01:09:35
NEIL Yeah. 

01:09:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Okay. So, do you think perhaps, one of the things you'd like to work on would be feel less upset about Chris leaving? 

01:09:40
NEIL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:09:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Coz ah. 

01:09:40
NEIL I don't, don't wanna really want to forget him, no. 

01:09:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Right, okay. That's important to you, isn't it? And we can't change the situation. We can't make him come back, and, you know, go to school with you. And we wouldn't want to take away the past 'coz he's very important and I think you're hoping that you get to stay in touch with him, aren't you? 

01:09:55
NEIL  Yeah. 

01:10:00
DR. ALISON WOOD But do you think it would be helpful to feel less upset about him, uh, leaving and think less about it? Yeah? 

01:10:05
NEIL Hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:10:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Hmm. When do you think, when you think about Chris(ph) leaving, do you, do you have thoughts- 

01:10:10
eliciting imagery 

01:10:10
DR. ALISON WOOD - that involve thinking in pictures, or is it just thoughts? 

01:10:15
NEIL My pictures. I'm just thinking of him on the last day... (crosstalk) 

01:10:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. 

01:10:20
NEIL ...when he left. 

01:10:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, you remember the last day at home and, uh, how did you find out that he was leaving? 

01:10:25
NEIL He told me that he was, uh, going off to another school. 

01:10:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. And you haven't suspected that beforehand, so it came as a complete shock. Okay. And does that picture come into your mind quite often, Neil? (crosstalk) 

01:10:40
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:10:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. 

01:10:40
NEIL Then I thought, I thought and I'd be all right. One of us (inaudible ) lot of friend but now I haven't got left and until Chris go.(ph) 

01:10:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, would you like to be less upset by those thoughts? Good. Well, I think that's an important, uhm, objective that we could set for ourselves. Uhm, the second thing that strikes me about you, ah, a 

01:11:00
therapist taking a more directive stance 

01:11:00
DR. ALISON WOOD - bit, Neil, is that, sometimes you guys don't seem very confident. What's your confidence levels like? 

01:11:05
NEIL I don't know I've got it. 

01:11:05
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. Were you confident before, or always? 

01:11:10
NEIL You mean right before Chris left? (crosstalk) 

01:11:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Uh hmm. 

01:11:15
NEIL A bit, yeah. I've, I've always been a bit. And I wish I have. 

01:11:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Find it difficult sort of meeting people and talking to people? 

01:11:20
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:11:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  Imagine there's a scale, uhm, Neil, from naught to 10. 

01:11:25
rating severity of goals 

01:11:25
DR. ALISON WOOD I've got this little chart here, and, uhm, on this end of the scale, uh, that's no confidence at all, and on this end of the scale it's, uhm, 10 out of 10, or full of confidence. Where would you put yourself on the confidence scale? 

01:11:40
NEIL On about naught to two, something like that. 

01:11:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, do you think it would be good to boost your confidence and for that to be something to work on together? 

01:11:45
NEIL Yeah. 

01:11:45
DR. ALISON WOOD  Excellent. Okay. So, I think, we should, uhm, definitely have that as one of our goals. And the second thing, how bad is that at the moment, uh, Neil, that, that the problem with feeling so upset about Chris leaving? 

01:12:00
NEIL It's pretty bad 'coz I, I'm always upset all the time. 

01:12:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, if we use the same scale where 10 out of 10 is very upset, all of the time, and naught out of ten is not upset at all, where would you put yourself on the scale? 

01:12:15
NEIL I don't, ten again, uh. 

01:12:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. So, right on the bottom of the scale, (crosstalk) 

01:12:20
NEIL Hmm. 

01:12:20
DR. ALISON WOOD ...very, very upset. 

01:12:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN With younger adolescents, spending a whole session working on emotional recognition can be a useful method for assessing their capacity for using more sophisticated cognitive techniques. Younger adolescent boys may find the concept of automatic thoughts quite difficult. Neil has already demonstrated that he is experiencing frequent thoughts and images of his friend Chris's departure. This clip demonstrates the following techniques: setting the agenda for a session, use of emotional recognition cards, separating feelings and thoughts, eliciting automatic thoughts, linking cognitions with moods. 

01:13:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Hello, Neil. 

01:13:25
NEIL  Hi. 

01:13:30
DR. ALISON WOOD How's the week that you had? 

01:13:30
NEIL Pretty bad one. 

01:13:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Very bad, or just pretty bad? 

01:13:35
NEIL Very bad, rather. 

01:13:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Very bad. Okay. Well, we're going to do something today, which is all about understanding the- 

01:13:40
setting the agenda 

01:13:40
DR. ALISON WOOD - types of moods that you have. And, uhm, kinda been you have a load which thoughts that go through your head. So, you've had some bad moods this week? 

01:13:50
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:13:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Okay. So, I think we're be able to use that in what we're going to work through the day. So, what would you like to start off with, please give me that card, to have a look at. So, read out to me what, what it says on that card? 

01:14:00
use of emotional recognition cards 

01:14:00
NEIL Sad and unhappy. 

01:14:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Now, I'm sure you, you felt that before, haven't you? Yeah. What I'd like you to do is imagine I've never felt that. I never say, uhm, most people have so this, you've never been in this situation that's very difficult. But imagine for a minute that I've never felt that like that. So try and describe to me what it feels like, uhm, in you, in- 

01:14:25
separating feelings and thoughts 

01:14:25
DR. ALISON WOOD - your body what it feels like to be very sad, very unhappy. 

01:14:30
NEIL Uhm. I'm always like, I always like crying and... (crosstalk) 

01:14:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  Good. 

01:14:40
NEIL ...feeling less and... (crosstalk) 

01:14:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. 

01:14:40
NEIL ...upset. 

01:14:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Tired. 

01:14:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:14:40
DR. ALISON WOOD What are your energy levels like? 

01:14:45
NEIL It feels like I ain't got time to do things, I can't really bother, I just- (crosstalk) 

01:14:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:14:45
NEIL  just kind of never do anything. 

01:14:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Weak and sort of bored and generally sometimes you have headaches and feel a little bit kind of ill. Is it, is it a bad feeling? 

01:14:55
NEIL  Yeah. So I was, uh, I can feel sick sometimes as well. 

01:15:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. That's, uh, that's a very, very good description, uh, Neil. When did you last feel like that? Can you remember the time, say in the last week when you felt like that? 

01:15:10
NEIL Hmm. Last night. 

01:15:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah? Tell me what's going on last night? 

01:15:15
NEIL Well, the phone rang and mymum picked it up I felt excited. 

01:15:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Came on when the... (crosstalk) 

01:15:20
NEIL Yeah. 

01:15:20
DR. ALISON WOOD ...when, when yourmum picked up the phone and started talking. Why don't you imagine, ah, Neil, that your life's on video and we can rewind it to that point when you started to feel very sad, very low, very unhappy. And I want you try to remember for me the kind of thoughts that were whizzing through your head. Can you remember some of them? 

01:15:40
NEIL Uhm, I was just thinking I don't wanna be on my own and, (crosstalk) 

01:15:45
DR. ALISON WOOD " I don't like to be on my own?" 

01:15:50
NEIL Yeah. I want to ask so much about charging(ph) as, as a friend. 

01:15:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Were those thoughts connected with the phone call, do you think? 

01:15:50
NEIL Yeah. 'Coz I thought when mymum picks the phone and I thought it'd be Chris but it... (crosstalk) 

01:16:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:16:00
NEIL ...wasn't. I'll never speak to him again, you know. 

01:16:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So, it brought all back for you...(crosstalk) 

01:16:05
NEIL Yeah. 

01:16:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and maybe some of the pictures as well. Okay. So, I think, can you say, ah, Neil, how those thoughts were very much linked in to how you were feeling at that time? That's excellent. Let's move on to another one now. I'm gonna give you another card, which is very different, okay? 

01:16:20
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:16:20
DR. ALISON WOOD  So, just have a look at that one. And what does it say? 

01:16:25
NEIL Happy. 

01:16:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So that's completely different, isn't it? In the same way, describe to me what it feels like to be happy, imagine I've never felt happy. 

01:16:30
NEIL When when you're not, when you feel very, very happy, it feels like when you... (crosstalk) 

01:16:40
DR. ALISON WOOD What do you like to know (inaudible )?... (crosstalk) 

01:16:41
NEIL ...that I don't, I have no worries, really. 

01:16:41
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:16:41
NEIL And, ah, I felt like I've been going swimming, of course, with mydad. 

01:16:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:16:45
NEIL And when was working on our car. He's an engineer, you know. 

01:16:50
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. Uh hmm. 

01:16:50
NEIL Yeah. So, I want to be an engineer when I'm older. 

01:16:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So, when you felt really good and happy and- 

01:16:55
eliciting automatic thoughts 

01:16:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  you could, I mean, sort of speed it up and lively, the kind of thoughts that are going through your head were, were what Neil? 

01:17:00
NEIL  Uhm, I didn't really have any worries then. 

01:17:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
NEIL And I was, I could do anything I thought was alright and well. 

01:17:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. And were you thinking nice things about the future? 

01:17:15
NEIL Yeah. I thought life is a, what I want to be when old, when I'm old I want to be an engineer like mydad. 

01:17:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Great, yeah. Even talking about that, Neil, how does that make you feel? 

01:17:20
NEIL  Hmm. It made me feel it's not, sometimes they're proud to own me. 

01:17:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. So, does it make you feel a little bit better? 

01:17:30
NEIL Yeah. 

01:17:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Actually, you know, remembering that time when you, when you felt happy. Good, it's excellent. You're really well at this. Let's try one more and, uhm, what's the next one. Well, that's quite a tough one, ah, Neil. 

01:17:40
NEIL  Angry. 

01:17:45
DR. ALISON WOOD How does it feel to be angry? What, what's it feel like and your, and your sort of bodily reactions? In the same way as you felt, you know, run down and tired being depressed. What's it feel like to be angry? 

01:17:55
NEIL You've get very annoyed and...(crosstalk) 

01:17:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. You get really tense, and that sort of thing. (crosstalk) 

01:18:00
NEIL Yeah. 

01:18:00
DR. ALISON WOOD You know, wound up inside? 

01:18:00
NEIL Yeah. 'Cause mymum is out there and (inaudible ) reminding me about, "You gotta do your homework," and, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:18:06
DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. 

01:18:10
NEIL everyone else has turned up for, for theirfriends. (crosstalk) 

01:18:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Excellent. 

01:18:10
NEIL I've got nofriends now but staying too worried about time. 

01:18:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So, sometimes you get angry with yourmom? 

01:18:15
NEIL Yeah. 

01:18:15
DR. ALISON WOOD And the thoughts that go through your head when you're angry have to do with, uhm, you know, yourmom and how do they go now? 

01:18:25
NEIL Well, she's always nagging me. 

01:18:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Right, (crosstalk) 

01:18:25
NEIL That's all. 

01:18:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Excellent. "She's always nagging me. Why can't you leave me alone?" Any other thoughts? 

01:18:35
NEIL Mom was angry, well, a lot of times. 

01:18:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:18:40
NEIL Upsetting. 

01:18:40
DR. ALISON WOOD It's not fair. Sometimes being angry and being sad get mixed up together, don't they? And sometimes it's quite hard to separate the two. Okay. That's excellent. You have done really well today. And, and what we do in this treatment- 

01:18:50
linking cognition with moods 

01:18:50
DR. ALISON WOOD - is actually, work out and that, the links between how you're feeling and the kind of thoughts that are going through your head and as I expect, you probably spotted that there's a big connection, haven't you? (crosstalk) 

01:19:00
NEIL Yeah. 

01:19:00
THERAPIST Yeah. And what we'll be going to do is to do a bit of work on those thoughts, uhm, to try and change them a little bit so that you'll feel better. Okay?

CHRISSIE VERDUYN After the previous session on emotional recognition, the therapist had set Neil a homework task to self-monitor his moods, thoughts and actions over the week and record them in his diary. The next session starts with a review of this. The therapist begins by giving positive feedback to Neil, and then goes on to use material from the diary to give him some strategies for managing symptoms of panic. It is also helpful to make the link between moods, positive reactions, thoughts, and the environment, if necessary, using the chart which we demonstrated in the previous vignette or demo. This clip demonstrates the following commonly used and useful techniques for the management of panic attacks: eliciting a description of a panic attack and developing an understanding of it, eliciting automatic thoughts and images, distraction techniques, self talk, use of mental exercises, use of progressive muscular relaxation exercises, setting homework task. 

01:20:40
DR. ALISON WOOD  When, when did you get on with your diary? 

01:20:45
NEIL About a week ago. And, I wrote this response to everything for you. 

01:20:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. You have 10 for me? 

01:20:55
NEIL Yeah. 

01:20:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Excellent. May I have a look? 

01:20:55
NEIL Yeah. 

01:20:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Which... (crosstalk) 

01:20:55
NEIL  I wish that were better about me. 

01:21:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. This is excellent, Neil. This is really, really good. So, you filled in and quite a few times in the last week where you felt really that low and depressed and fed up. And what was going on at that time and the hot(ph) thoughts that eventually you had? Okay, would you say, pick one that was really a bad one? And we're going to work on that one today?(crosstalk) 

01:21:20
NEIL Yeah. 

01:21:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Which one sticks out to your mind? 

01:21:20
NEIL On Monday night. 

01:21:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Tell me a bit about what happened. 

01:21:25
eliciting description of panic attack 

01:21:25
NEIL That was Monday night. I was at the karate club. And I kept just thinking about Chris. Except that Monday night, I was, when I thought when I started shaking and was sweating... (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Okay. 

01:21:40
NEIL ...and Andy stopped by to phone my mom, she has to come and pick me up. 

01:21:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So your mom had come and pick you up and take you home. Okay. What kind of thoughts were going through your head at that uh, before you became really, really panicky and shaky, Neil? 

01:21:55
NEIL I thought about Chris and, and about I needed to turn this over to chronicle. 

01:22:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Why did you have to leave 'em? And what, why isn't Chris still here and make any other friends? Yeah, the thoughts you've had before were about you have to face life without him. 

01:22:10
NEIL It all, it all comes back. 

01:22:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah. Did you get the pictures as well? 

01:22:15
NEIL Yeah. 

01:22:15
DR. ALISON WOOD You have? Okay. Well, I think one of the things we need to do today is to think about what things you can do in these situations to help yourself feel better because uhm, this sounds very stressful, isn't it, Neil? Like I said, it was quite embarrassing with that... (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
NEIL I can't breathe. 

01:22:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...that you have to be brought home by your mom. 

01:22:30
NEIL  Yeah. 

01:22:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Was your mom got worried too? 

01:22:35
NEIL Yeah. 

01:22:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Okay. Have you tried anything when these attacks, these panic attacks come on to ward them off? 

01:22:40
NEIL No. I, I don't know what to do 'cause I'm too (inaudible ), I just felt nervous and I just don't know what to do. 

01:22:50
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. So, you, too, was wind up in that state. Okay. Can you, can you sort of detect them coming on quite early? 

01:22:55
NEIL Yeah. 

01:22:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Do you feel, feel this off and your hands start to sweat... (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
NEIL Yeah. 

01:23:00
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and your heart go a bit faster? 

01:23:00
NEIL Yeah, I know when I'm coming off because of that. I always know that I was really sweating 

01:23:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Alright. Okay. That is really, really important.(crosstalk) 

01:23:10
NEIL Shaking. 

01:23:10
distraction techniques 

01:23:10
DR. ALISON WOOD It's brilliant, Neil, because if you can recognize the early, early signs then uh, you're gonna be able to learn how to ward them off. 'Cause it's very possible to build up your strength in warding off panic attack. And I'm gonna tell you a couple of tricks today that I want you to put into practice over the next week? 

01:23:25
NEIL  Okay. 

01:23:30
distraction technique 

01:23:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. The first one is when you feel that sort of sweaty, tense [001:23:35] feeling coming on, the thoughts really going round and round in your head about Chris, about the future, and about uhm, a few of your friends and what's happening, I want you to uhm, tell yourself to stop thinking. And focus your mind on something that you can see around you. So, say you're in the karate hall and you'd be there and you make yourself look uhm, at the end of the room, say, or at the wall next to you. It might be notes spread on the wall. It might be other people talking. And what you have to do is, make yourself concentrate on what you can see and describe it to yourself. So, you might say uhm, you know, I can see no sport, got three notices on one's about a tennis tournament next week, one's about the wresting on Friday. And you, actually, in your head, talked to yourself. And that gives your mind a big space from those thoughts. You can slow your breathing down and you can gradually get in control of yourself. And then when you've done with your talking to yourself, your observation, you then have to move on to do something. So, you go back to your karate and start doing your exercises again. 

01:24:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:24:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. Do you think you can imagine doing that? 

01:24:40
NEIL  Uhm, I don't know. 

01:24:45
DR. ALISON WOOD It's hard and it's good to practice it in situations where, you know, things aren't too bad. So, at home, if you start thinking about Chris, you know, sitting in the sofa (inaudible )before. 

01:24:58
NEIL Okay. 

01:24:58
DR. ALISON WOOD  Then, I want you to look around the front room and start to actually look at what you can see. Simple things. Look at the bookshelf, count the books. Describe them to yourself. Okay? 

01:25:10
NEIL Okay. 

01:25:10
use of mental exercises 

01:25:10
DR. ALISON WOOD And I want you to really practice that uhm, over next week. And maybe, 'cause that's a, a trick which you can teach yourself to do. And there's another couple of things which you could try to. One is, do you like uhm, mental arithmetic or a sort of word exercises? 

01:25:25
NEIL About math, yeah. 

01:25:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. You are very good at math, aren't you?(crosstalk) 

01:25:30
NEIL I'm good at math. Yeah. 

01:25:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Yes. I, I just remembered you're very good at chess, aren't you? 

01:25:30
NEIL Yeah. 

01:25:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? And you play, do you sort of go through chess scenarios at home with the computer? 

01:25:35
NEIL  Yeah. I like, I always, my mom(ph) and I would play chess most of the time. 

01:25:40
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. Well it, well this would be something you could try. 'Cause what do I suggest, imagine you're back in that karate hall again. Hands are going sweaty, you can feel it coming on. I want you to, in your mind, bring out a picture of the latest chess puzzle or, or the latest situation in the chess game where you've got to decide what move to make. 

01:26:00
NEIL Hmm. 

01:26:00
use of progressive muscular relaxation 

01:26:00
DR. ALISON WOOD  And then you had, I want you to look at that chess board and plan what you are going to make. When you plan the move, go back and do your karate. And I think you'll find that some of those uhm, you know, things like the sweating and heart racing and the breathing, will have to go a bit better. If it hasn't, just do it again. Okay? And the third thing, remember the exercises that we, we did last week... (crosstalk) 

01:26:30
NEIL Yeah. 

01:26:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...instead of tensing... (crosstalk) 

01:26:30
NEIL Breathing moment. 

01:26:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and relaxing and the breathing? 

01:26:30
NEIL Yeah. 

01:26:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Have you, how do you found those? And relaxing a little bit? 

01:26:35
NEIL Sounds good. Yeah. But, it's difficult sometimes, you know.(crosstalk) 

01:26:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. I told you what to do, isn't it? Tell me the ones you where you tense your fists? Breathe in... (crosstalk) 

01:26:45
NEIL Yeah. Breath in. 

01:26:45
setting homework task 

01:26:45
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and then breathe out. Relieved, okay. Well, that's something that you can add on to your concentration exercises that you can practice this week, okay? So, what I want you to do this week uhm, Neil, is in your diary, I want you to write down the times when you start to get one those attacks. 

01:27:05
NEIL Yeah. 

01:27:05
DR. ALISON WOOD And I want you to write down, just like what you've been doing before the kind of thoughts that were going through your head. And also to write down what you've tried to ward them off. Okay? 

01:27:15
NEIL Yeah. 

01:27:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Do you think you can give that a try? 

01:27:15
NEIL Yeah. 

01:27:15

01:27:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The next clip of video shows the sessions involving Neil, his mother and his therapist. There have been some improvements which have been noted by both Neil and his mother. In the first few minutes of the session, I used this feedback on Neil's progress. The rest of the session is spent planning activities for Neil to engage in to combat his symptoms of apathy, social withdrawal, anhedonia, and lost of interest. Activities scheduling would be very difficult without Neil's mother taking such an active role.

CHRISSIE VERDUYN  This section of the video demonstrates the following: review of completed activity schedule, linking periods of inactivity with low moods, search for appropriate activities - active role of parent, planning activities, concept of "mastery," use of behavioural experiments. 

01:28:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  Hello, Mrs. Smith. Hi, Neil. 

01:28:35
NEIL Hi. 

01:28:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Hi, Neil. And, we are here together today to sort of see how things going, really. How do you think uhm, Neil seems? 

01:28:40
MRS. SMITH Well, he seems a lot brighter, you know. I noticed quite a change. He has no more of those uh, panic attacks? 

01:28:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Well, that's excellent, isn't it, Neil. Is that right? You haven't had any in the last week? 

01:28:55
NEIL No, not any. 

01:28:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Brilliant. Well, Neil has worked really hard on those actually. And uhm, I think he has been using some of the exercises that we have been trying here and putting into practice. He has really got out of that problem. 

01:29:05
MRS. SMITH He just seems to mope around a lot at home, though. I mean... (crosstalk) 

01:29:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:29:10
MRS. SMITH ...he seems to be watching an awful lot of television. 

01:29:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Is that fair, Neil? 

01:29:10
NEIL Yeah. 

01:29:10
review of completed activity schedule 

01:29:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. How did you get on uhm, last week, Neil completed what we call an activity schedule... (crosstalk) 

01:29:20
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:29:20
DR. ALISON WOOD ...which is a little sort of uhm, experimental assessment... (crosstalk) 

01:29:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:29:25
DR. ALISON WOOD ...of what he does, spends his time doing. 

01:29:25
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. Yes, he told me about that. 

01:29:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  And uhm, you know, have, have you managed to do that now, Neil? 

01:29:30
NEIL Yeah. But I don't know if it's right. 

01:29:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. Can I have a look? Yeah? 

01:29:35
NEIL Yeah. 

01:29:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Great. Thanks a lot. Let's just have uh, a quick look. This is his mini diary... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:29:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ... actually. He is a... (crosstalk) 

01:29:40
MRS. SMITH He works very hard at school. 

01:29:40
DR. ALISON WOOD He worked very hard on it. And that and he has really remembered it. And this is fantastic. Now, let's have a look. So uhm, gosh, you do spend a lot of (laughs) time watching, watching, say, during the day, you are at school. So, that's fairly taken care of. And then when you come from school say at 4 o'clock really, you do your homework and watch TV all evening. And I'm just looking at Saturday. Uhm, and you kind of put in here, sort of uhm, 9 till 10 TV in the lounge, 10 to 11 TV in the lounge, 11 to 12 TV in the lounge, and then you had some lunch. So, was this interesting, Neil? Having looked at the uhm, list of things that you get up to? 

01:30:25
linking periods of inactivity with low moods 

01:30:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Do you think there might be a connection between the times when you're bored and hanging around and the times when you think about Chris and feel sad? 

01:30:35
NEIL Yes. When I was the telly that's when I'm reminded of Chris... (crosstalk) 

01:30:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. 

01:30:35
NEIL ...if we watch telly. It's also the ones that takes my mind off. 

01:30:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. That's, that's... (crosstalk) 

01:30:40
NEIL Of some things. 

01:30:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ...in one sense that's very good 'coz I'm sure you are right. But do the thoughts kind of break through and, you know, 'coz sometimes there's not much on the TV to watch, you think?(crosstalk) 

01:30:50
NEIL Oh, sometimes it's just boring and I come back to them. 

01:30:50
DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. Okay. 

01:30:55
MRS. SMITH He has not been back to karate? 

01:30:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. You haven't been back. to karate since that... (crosstalk) 

01:31:00
NEIL No, I don't. Thinking about him...(crosstalk) 

01:31:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...since that's going to... crosstalk) 

01:31:05
NEIL ...it make me. Thinking about it makes me (inaudible ) 

01:31:06
search for appropriate activities - active role of parent 

01:31:06
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah, I understand that it's difficult. What did Neil use to be like, you know, in the past before all these happened, what were the things he used to do? 

01:31:15
MRS. SMITH Well, he was very keen on karate and... (crosstalk) 

01:31:15
DR. ALISON WOOD He used to go every week to his karate?(crosstalk) 

01:31:20
MRS. SMITH Oh, yes, yes, like clockwork. He used to show me a few moves (inaudible ) and he used to help his dad a lot. 

01:31:27
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah? Hmm. 

01:31:30
MRS. SMITH (inaudible ) 

01:31:32
DR. ALISON WOOD I know that's something that Neil really enjoys. 

01:31:32
MRS. SMITH  We used to go out shopping and bike sometimes. 

01:31:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? 

01:31:35
NEIL  Uh hmm. 

01:31:40
DR. ALISON WOOD You love football and 'cause of this, you got some sports in school, you really, now? 

01:31:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:31:40
DR. ALISON WOOD You used to play football? 

01:31:45
NEIL I used to, yeah. I was in the football team for a long time. 

01:31:45
DR. ALISON WOOD  Really? So things are quite different... (crosstalk) 

01:31:50
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:31:50
DR. ALISON WOOD ...now, I think. It, it is very important because uhm, a lot of times and probably your mom will recognize this, there will be times when you got things to do and where they're coming from... (crosstalk) 

01:32:00
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:32:00
DR. ALISON WOOD ...then you get to release them, all the times when, you know, bad thoughts break through... (crosstalk) 

01:32:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:32:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and you start to sizzle from dwelling and thinking over. And uhm, one of the things, I think, we should plan today is to slowly get Neil back to what he's like before. 

01:32:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:32:15
DR. ALISON WOOD So, uhm, I got something here which is uhm, a bit, well, it's similar to what you have been doing in your diary this week. But this is for you and your mom to fill in together. And this is called an activity schedule. So, it's got the column is for the week. It's got a column for each day... (crosstalk) 

01:32:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:32:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...and then the day is actually broken up starting at 6 in the morning. 

01:32:35
MRS. SMITH (inaudible ) much in for that. 

01:32:37
DR. ALISON WOOD I guess, I guess that's gonna be fun, isn't it? (crosstalk) 

01:32:40
NEIL That would be fun. 

01:32:40
DR. ALISON WOOD So, this is gonna be lasting up to, you know, till midnight. But, you, you know, we understand you're not gonna be around up about until then. But, I think, that, what I'd like you to do is (inaudible )thing the two of you together uh, through the next week. And actually, put some things in there uh, Neil, you know. What day do you normally go to karate? 

01:33:00
planning activities 

01:33:00
NEIL Uh, Mondays. 

01:33:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Monday nights?(crosstalk) 

01:33:05
NEIL Monday nights. 

01:33:05
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. And now, (inaudible )go back, but uhm, or maybe we need to do that later in the schedule. Maybe not next week. What other things could you sort of schedule in for, say, Tuesday or Wednesday? 

01:33:15
NEIL  I don't really have anything, but probably do shopping with my mom.(crosstalk) 

01:33:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? 

01:33:25
MRS. SMITH (inaudible )Yes, we do tend to get to supermarket.(crosstalk) 

01:33:30
DR. ALISON WOOD (inaudible ) Well, that would be excellent. Why don't you do that one night, go shopping with your mom?(crosstalk) 

01:33:32
MRS. SMITH (inaudible ) 

01:33:34
DR. ALISON WOOD  Uhm, what about football? You, you used to play with the boys around where you live, don't you?(crosstalk) 

01:33:40
NEIL No, I don't like it. I don't know. I don't like it. That's what I am saying. 

01:33:40
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. You used to play with your dad? 

01:33:45
NEIL Yeah. 

01:33:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Now, the, the nights are bit lighter, perhaps you might prefer to play with your dad when need be? 

01:33:50
MRS. SMITH Maybe. That's a good idea. It's better to get into recreation ground. 

01:33:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. Just to, gonna get yourself warmed up, (inaudible )of your fitness, aren't you? 

01:34:02
NEIL Hmm. 

01:34:02
DR. ALISON WOOD Are you interested in swimming? Do, do you do any swimming at all? 

01:34:05
MRS. SMITH You used to. 

01:34:05
NEIL I used to go swimming but it's (inaudible ) 

01:34:08
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:34:08
MRS. SMITH  I could take you downtown, sure. 

01:34:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah?(crosstalk) 

01:34:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:34:10
DR. ALISON WOOD That's another excellent idea. Uhm, I would get now to the, you know, sort of complicated things... (crosstalk) 

01:34:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:34:15
DR. ALISON WOOD ...just small things, maybe there might just be some jobs to do around the house on weekends, perhaps arrange to spend a bit of time with your dad in the garage, help him out with the car. 

01:34:25
NEIL Yeah. 

01:34:25
DR. ALISON WOOD  Are there any old friends that you can phone up, Neil? 

01:34:30
NEIL No, I don't. 

01:34:30
DR. ALISON WOOD What do you think of him, Mrs. Smith? 

01:34:30
MRS. SMITH Hmm. 

01:34:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Any uhm, moms that you're friend with uh, sort of know that their teenage boys might be amenable to? 

01:34:45
MRS. SMITH Hmm. Who was that lad on the next street? You used to see him occasionally? 

01:34:50
NEIL Louis, he is not. Wish I had been close (inaudible ). 

01:34:56
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. There was this plenty of uhm, young people at the, the church. 

01:35:00
DR. ALISON WOOD That's a good idea.(crosstalk) 

01:35:00
MRS. SMITH Good idea. 

01:35:00
DR. ALISON WOOD 'Cause you used to go to Sunday school, as well, did you not? 

01:35:05
NEIL Yeah. 

01:35:05
MRS. SMITH He's not very interested with this. 

01:35:05
NEIL  I, I'll try I can. 

01:35:10
concept of "mastery" 

01:35:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. Well, the important things is a lot of the things you used to enjoy, you know. Uhm, and you will be out to enjoy them again. Just remind me of the last time you did something in the village and you want to do it. 

01:35:25
NEIL My homework. 

01:35:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. When was that? 

01:35:25
NEIL  Uhm, last night. 

01:35:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Last night. 'Cause you've really didn't want to do your homework? You put it off, put it off, put it off, and then did it. 

01:35:35
NEIL I did at the end. 

01:35:35
DR. ALISON WOOD How did you feel at the end? 

01:35:35
NEIL It went well. When I did it at the end, I felt I'm all right now. I'm relaxed a little bit now (inaudible ).(crosstalk) 

01:35:43
DR. ALISON WOOD  And did you feel pleased with yourself? 

01:35:45
NEIL A bit, yeah. 

01:35:45
DR. ALISON WOOD That you got some sense of achievement? 

01:35:45
NEIL Yeah. 

01:35:45
use of behavioral experiments 

01:35:45
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. I want you to regard this a bit like that. So, you really want to do these things, you know. You really want to go out and play football. You really want to go out swimming. You really want to phone up (inaudible ) from Sunday school, but take yourself with this experiment. You've got nothing to lose. Maybe you'll turn to this (inaudible )than watching TV. If I do it, I might please myself, you'll never know, you might enjoy it. Okay? 

01:36:10
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:36:10
DR. ALISON WOOD So, How about giving it a try over the next week? 

01:36:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:36:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Uhm, the two of you sitting down after you go home today. 

01:36:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:36:15
DR. ALISON WOOD  Actually, I'm just planning, sort of, put only one thing to do during the week each evening. And it doesn't have to involve going out. And uhm, on weekends, see what you can schedule in... (crosstalk) 

01:36:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:36:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...during the days to keep yourself a little bit busy, okay? 

01:36:35
NEIL Yeah. 

01:36:35
Activity Scheduling review of completed activity schedule linking period of inactivity with low moods search for appropriate activities - active role of parent planning activities concept of "mastery" use of behavioural experiments cognitive techniques 

01:36:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  The next session takes place later in the treatment program and moves on from using behavioural and social skills techniques to developing cognitive strategies for combating low moods. Neil is still experiencing low moods, but he has gained control over his panic attacks. And his motivation and energy levels have improved. It is healthful to contrast the approach taken on Emma and Neil. 

01:37:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN The following cognitive techniques are demonstrated, setting the agenda, determining the "hot" thought, examining the evidence supporting the "hot" thought, questioning to find evidence that does not support the "hot" thought, generating alternative, more balanced thoughts, use of a thought record. 

01:37:35
setting the agenda 

01:37:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  So far now, (inaudible )a lot on detecting on some of the thoughts that go through your head when you feel low and depressed. You got really, really good at that. And uhm, you've been keeping a diary regularly for me, which is excellent. With those I work on uhm, the kind of emergency situations when you get overwhelmed by those thoughts. And you've got really good avoiding those thoughts now. 

01:38:00
NEIL  Uh hmm. 

01:38:05
determining the "hot" thought 

01:38:05
DR. ALISON WOOD And what I want you to do today is to focus on some of the thoughts which come quite frequently. And see if we can modify them a little bit and understand them. Okay? So, let me just a look at your diary for the last week. And we'll pick out uhm, something that has happened which we'll use to work on. Okay. So, let's look, it's, it's a typical time. Right, Sunday night when you felt low and fed up. And the, the thought that, that comes out to my head and one you've circled as your, as your "hot" thought is I'll never have any friends. Doesn't that thought come frequently for you now? 

01:38:45
NEIL Yeah. 

01:38:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Still quite often. 

01:38:45
NEIL Yeah. 

01:38:45
DR. ALISON WOOD You haven't have any friends? 

01:38:45
NEIL  I don't have any. 

01:38:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So that, you feel quite strongly? You really believe that? You never have any friends. Okay. 

01:38:55
examining the evidence supporting the "hot" thought 

01:38:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Well, I'd like you to look at that a little bit more closely today. And the first thing I want you to think through is what, what's the evidence that you've got that you'll never have any friends? What, what is your base of that thought that you think? 

01:39:15
NEIL I don't really deserve any one and I can't gain any friends since Chris left. 

01:39:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. And the fact that Chris left is that, is that the main thing that supports that thought that you'll never have any friends? 

01:39:30
NEIL Even if I'm ready... (crosstalk) 

01:39:30
DR. ALISON WOOD But? 

01:39:30
NEIL ...but sometimes I wanna move out. I don't understand, go for the people and I do adjust, things like that. 

01:39:35
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. 

01:39:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:39:40
DR. ALISON WOOD So, you are not to fight the way it turns when you and Chris did fall out... (crosstalk) 

01:39:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:39:40
DR. ALISON WOOD  And at those times, you, you said that you met other friends. 

01:39:45
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:39:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? So, the main supporting evidence that you're not having friends is the fact that Chris has left. Yeah? Is there any other things that, that mean that, you know, it makes you think that very strongly about not having other friends. 

01:40:00
NEIL I don't know. I just, I don't think I'd ever want, you know, getting any calls or anything. 

01:40:05
questioning to find evidence that doesn't support "hot" thought 

01:40:05
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So you don't get any phone calls from any of your friend now, right? I see that's the second thing. And those are very important things. Let's look at the other way around, let's turn around a little bit now, Neil, and I actually look for uhm, things which might suggest that, that might not be true. That the fact that you thought that "I'll never have any friends" might not actually be true. So, you've mentioned times in the past when you fell out with Chris, you made other friends? 

01:40:35
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:40:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? And, uhm, that might happen again, wont it? 

01:40:40
NEIL Hmm. 

01:40:40
DR. ALISON WOOD So if you're able to make friends in the past when you fell out with Chris, do you think you might be able too in the future? 

01:40:45
NEIL  I don't know. Not again... (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
DR. ALISON WOOD It's hard... (crosstalk) 

01:40:50
NEIL (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

01:40:52
DR. ALISON WOOD ...but if, if you've done it once, it might be a possibility that... (crosstalk) 

01:40:55
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:40:55
DR. ALISON WOOD ...you'll do it again? Possible? 

01:41:00
NEIL Possible, yeah. 

01:41:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? Okay. Uhm, the other thing is too much in that uhm, imagine that, that Chris said to you, you know, Chris is something that you care about a lot, isn't it? Uhm, "I'll never gonna have any friends. I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life." What would you say in return to him? 

01:41:15
NEIL Hmm. Probably, I (inaudible )a friend and, uh, I'll, I'll go if that's okay with you. 

01:41:21
DR. ALISON WOOD  All right. Would you be quite upset if he said that? 

01:41:25
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:41:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? And you're going to help with? 

01:41:25
NEIL Yeah. 

01:41:25
DR. ALISON WOOD - Yeah? What do you think Chris would feel if he heard you say, "I'll never have any friends"? 

01:41:35
NEIL He'll probably say, "Yeah, I'll be your friend, don't worry." 

01:41:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Right. So even though he's moved away... (crosstalk) 

01:41:40
NEIL Yeah. 

01:41:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ...uhm, he does want to keep in touch, doesn't he? Yeah? And what about your friendship with Chris, Neil? How long did you know Chris? 

01:41:45
NEIL  Since I was about nine. 

01:41:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Okay. So how many years is that? 

01:41:50
NEIL Three to four years. 

01:41:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah? 

01:41:55
NEIL Yeah. 

01:41:55
DR. ALISON WOOD And all that time that you fell out occasionally you're pretty close friends, weren't you? 

01:42:00
NEIL Yeah. 

01:42:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Would do you think that if you had one close friend and you've shown that you've been able to make friends, do you think it might be possible to do it again? 

01:42:05
NEIL  I could probably have to take off my nervousness. 

01:42:10
DR. ALISON WOOD  Yeah. 

01:42:15
NEIL Since Chris left me. 

01:42:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. It wouldn't be the same, would it? Because it wouldn't be Chris, but I think it's very important if you have another friend, you meet some people, I see I've never had a friend. 

01:42:25
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:42:25
generating alternative, more balanced thoughts 

01:42:25
DR. ALISON WOOD So when you have that thought, "I'll never have any friends," do you think sort of thinking through "Well, I have had one good friend?" (crosstalk) 

01:42:30
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:42:30
DR. ALISON WOOD  And you know Chris has moved but he's not going to another country and I'll still see him. 

01:42:35
NEIL I used to have other friend (inaudible ) 

01:42:41
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah, that's right. You have, you've done it once and thirdly, well, the way it doesn't, you know, fill out the person and to make friends then, uhm, do you think those three thoughts might help challenge that thought you have about never having any friends? 

01:42:55
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:42:55
DR. ALISON WOOD It might do, right? 

01:42:55
NEIL  It might, yeah. 

01:43:00
DR. ALISON WOOD It's hard and I think you have to uhm, be quite firm with yourself, uh, Neil, in the way that you work through it. But sometimes it can help to actually uhm, argue this up a bit, okay?(crosstalk) 

01:43:15
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:43:15
use of a thought record 

01:43:15
DR. ALISON WOOD And that's something that I want you to practice over the next week. So, uhm, I've got a special chart that I'd like you to try to fill in for me, okay? And it's kind of going through what we've just been doing there and it's, it's quite difficult, all right. So, I'm going to explain it to you. The first three columns are exactly what you've been used to do, okay, so that will... (crosstalk) 

01:43:35
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:43:35
DR. ALISON WOOD ... be uhm, the, the day and what, when, where of the situation. The next column is how you're being feeling and the next column is the thought. So that's where you put on, "I don't have any friends" and "It's all my fault that Chris left me." And then in this, this column, I want you to write down the evidence for that thought entry, okay. So that's "Chris has left me," uhm, "Chris has moved", uhm, and any other things that make you think that you'll never have any friends. And the next column, that's for putting all the evidence that you can think of which it might mean it, it might not be true, all right? So that's, you know, I was able make a friend in Chris, uhm, when we fell out, I made other friends. Uhm, I still phone Chris and he still wants to be my friend and, you know, I have met some people at my new school that were okay and I'm getting to know them, all right? And then at the end, I want you to come up with an alternative thought to replace this thought. All right. So rather than think "I'll never have any friends," I want you to change that thought to something that might be a little bit more reasonable. Can you think of, of another thought that might be a little bit more reasonable rather than "I'll never have any friends"? 

01:44:50
NEIL  Uhm, I might be able to have some friends... (crosstalk) 

01:44:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Brilliant. 

01:44:55
NEIL ...like that. 

01:44:55
DR. ALISON WOOD  Okay. So, you know, "I, I'm very sad that Chris has left, but I'm hoping I will make some new friends in the future." Yeah? Okay. That's excellent. So, I'm giving this chart to take home with you, uh, Neil. I want you to, to try that and then it takes a bit, a bit of practice and next time, we'll go through some extra tips to help you with this column here 'cause that's a difficult one. Okay?

01:47:05
NEIL Waking and telling, telling you my problems about.(crosstalk) 

01:47:10
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. Yeah. What's other things elicited by the treatment other than just talking? What were the particular kind of things that you've practiced together do you think that helped you most?

MRS. SMITH Right. 

01:47:35
emphasising self-control 

01:47:35
NEIL And, you know, those are gonna often work, I think about something else, what I'm trying to do is try to breathe and it seems to work with me.(crosstalk) 

01:47:40
DR. ALISON WOOD Brilliant. And you're not, not had one for how long, now? 

01:47:45

01:47:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. 

01:47:55
MRS. SMITH ...'cause, I mean, to be honest, I thought he was some kind of fatal... (crosstalk)

DR. ALISON WOOD  Right. 

01:48:00
MRS. SMITH ...you know, I mean, ... (crosstalk) 

01:48:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Right.

MRS. SMITH ...we better treat him. 

01:48:05
DR. ALISON WOOD And, and looking back, what do you think about it now? 

01:48:05
MRS. SMITH Well, I suppose, uh, I mean, to be honest, I'm worried that it's, you know, once we stopped coming here that... (crosstalk) 

01:48:15
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:48:15
MRS. SMITH ...it's all gonna start again. I mean, I, I know he's, uhm, he's going, he's arranged to see Chris during the... (crosstalk)

01:48:59
DR. ALISON WOOD You know, I think, you know, Neil got so confident at warding off these attacks. They, they, they may will, you know, start and you may have the feelings of something's coming on, but I think Neil is so good at warding it off now... (crosstalk) 

01:49:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:49:10
DR. ALISON WOOD ...that he could actually... (crosstalk) 

01:49:10

DR. ALISON WOOD ...you know, successfully do that. What do you think, Neil?

MRS. SMITH ...very much.(crosstalk) 

01:49:30

01:49:30
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:49:30
DR. ALISON WOOD ...panic attacks. And... (crosstalk) 

01:49:30
MRS. SMITH  Yes. 

01:49:35
DR. ALISON WOOD ...all the tests showed that thankfully, there was no evidence that he's had an... (crosstalk)

MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:49:35
DR. ALISON WOOD ... epilepsy or any (inaudible ) or anything.(crosstalk) 

01:49:41
MRS. SMITH Right.

01:49:50
DR. ALISON WOOD About the meetings we had with your mom, you know, it's a bit of planning, didn't we, Neil? 

01:49:55
NEIL Hmm. The writing of diary. I thought... (crosstalk) 

01:49:55
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:49:55
NEIL ...that was a bit, I thought that was... (crosstalk) 

01:49:55
MRS. SMITH He actually quite enjoyed that, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:50:00
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. 

01:50:00
MRS. SMITH ...writing a journal.(crosstalk)

01:50:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:50:05
DR. ALISON WOOD (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

01:50:06
MRS. SMITH It made him a bit more organized at home as well. 

01:50:06
DR. ALISON WOOD All right. You think? (crosstalk) 

01:50:06
MRS. SMITH  Didn't you, Neil? 

01:50:10
DR. ALISON WOOD You did a little bit of planning together, didn't you?(crosstalk) 

01:50:10
MRS. SMITH Yes. It was very good. 

01:50:10
DR. ALISON WOOD You planned those all sort of, uh, things which was... (crosstalk) 

01:50:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:50:15
DR. ALISON WOOD ...that's excellent. What about the exercise we did with your thoughts, Neil? How did you find those? 

01:50:20
NEIL Uhm, I thought that was good, yeah. 

01:50:25
prediction of future problems 

01:50:25
DR. ALISON WOOD Is there... (crosstalk) 

01:50:25
NEIL That's great. 

01:50:25
DR. ALISON WOOD ...be something you could in the future... (crosstalk) 

01:50:25
NEIL Yeah. 

01:50:25
DR. ALISON WOOD ...you know, if you started getting difficult thoughts again? 

01:50:30
NEIL I think I'll just try and make new more friends now. 

01:50:35
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:50:35
NEIL They live near me as well so that I can, uh, go to their house (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

01:50:43
DR. ALISON WOOD Good.(crosstalk) 

01:50:43
NEIL ...all travel and that's it... (crosstalk) 

01:50:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Good. 

01:50:45
NEIL .. to Chris' house. 

01:50:45
DR. ALISON WOOD I mean, Neil is always gonna be the sort of person that worries quite a lot.(crosstalk) 

01:50:50
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:50:50
DR. ALISON WOOD And, uhm... (crosstalk) 

01:50:50
MRS. SMITH And he got that from me. 

01:50:50
DR. ALISON WOOD You understand how that feels, don't you? Uhm, so, you know, we can't change the way Neil is... (crosstalk) 

01:50:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:50:55
DR. ALISON WOOD ...but what we hopefully gonna have to do in the treatment is give him some little tips really... (crosstalk) 

01:51:00
MRS. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

01:51:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...for how to, you know, tackle times when he is very worried and when... (crosstalk) 

01:51:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:51:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...the worry... (crosstalk) 

01:51:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:51:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ... gonna get some different. 

01:51:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:51:10
DR. ALISON WOOD What about your dad, how do you think he's, uhm, has he noticed any changes in you, Neil? 

01:51:15
NEIL Uhm, I, I think he's, uh, he has helped, he help me more... (crosstalk) 

01:51:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Uh hmm. 

01:51:20
NEIL ...'cause we've got swimming every Saturday now.(crosstalk) 

01:51:20
DR. ALISON WOOD Well, you've... (crosstalk) 

01:51:25
NEIL And... (crosstalk) 

01:51:25
DR. ALISON WOOD ...spending more time with your dad, don't you? 

01:51:25
NEIL ...when he comes home about 12 in a Saturday, so what we do is we just swim for about an hour. 

01:51:30
DR. ALISON WOOD Brilliant.(crosstalk) 

01:51:30
NEIL And I'm excited, you know... (crosstalk) 

01:51:30
DR. ALISON WOOD That's good. 

01:51:30
NEIL ...especially at that. 

01:51:30
DR. ALISON WOOD So, has he noticed an improvement in Neil? 

01:51:35
MRS. SMITH I think so. I mean, he doesn't, you know, he's a man of few words. No, I think he...(crosstalk) 

01:51:40
DR. ALISON WOOD It would be very good to meet him actually, do you think... (crosstalk) 

01:51:40
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:51:40
DR. ALISON WOOD ... it would be possible the next time if we meet together? 

01:51:45
NEIL Uh hmm. 

01:51:45
DR. ALISON WOOD Uhm, because what... (crosstalk) 

01:51:45
MRS. SMITH Well, if could fit in with, with, with his work... (crosstalk) 

01:51:50
DR. ALISON WOOD With his work. 

01:51:50
MRS. SMITH ...he's very busy. 

01:51:50
planning future sessions 

01:51:50
DR. ALISON WOOD Yeah. Quite as I, so we, we generally disappoint this, I think Neil done really, really well.(crosstalk) 

01:51:55
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:51:55
DR. ALISON WOOD And, uhm, you know, I think he's ready now to space the appointments out and what I'd like to suggest... (crosstalk) 

01:52:00
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:52:00
DR. ALISON WOOD ...is that rather meet him every week, we meet sort of every two to four weeks. Uhm, for... (crosstalk) 

01:52:05
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:52:05
DR. ALISON WOOD ...a few more times and then when you feel ready, we can say, "Well, that's enough for now." But you can... (crosstalk) 

01:52:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:52:10
DR. ALISON WOOD ...always come back in the future if you need to. 

01:52:10
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:52:10
DR. ALISON WOOD And I think perhaps the next time it would be good if we meet altogether with your dad.(crosstalk) 

01:52:15
MRS. SMITH Uh hmm. 

01:52:15
DR. ALISON WOOD And you know, to just to fill him in, to tell him more about the treatment and find out what his views are, okay? 

01:52:20
ending therapy review of progress, feedback eliciting helpful strategies emphasising self-control confirming understanding of panic attacks predicting future problems planning future sessions 4 conclusion common questions & problems 

01:52:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  I guess in supervision, the, the single most common thing I get asked, the common, is common problem is, uh, what to do when kids don't do their homework. 

01:52:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:52:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Do you have some series of strategies? (crosstalk) 

01:52:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh. 

01:52:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON What do you do in supervision when you're talking therapists about how... (crosstalk) 

01:53:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

01:53:00
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...to, how to deal with that situation? 

01:53:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I suppose, I think the first step is to make sure that the patient understand why it is so important in the first instance, and I think you have to build the whole idea of homework and task outside the session, from the out setting to how you're going to talk to the patient about the program. I think that often beginning therapists don't do that, they, they expect that patient isn't gonna want to do homework and since... (crosstalk) 

01:53:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Right. 

01:53:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...some way, they don't quite explain enough about... (crosstalk) 

01:53:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Uh hmm. 

01:53:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...how important it is.(crosstalk) 

01:53:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Yeah. 

01:53:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN So, I think you have to set it up right to start with. And then I, I think that you need to make sure that you give all the important cues about why it's important during the session, so when they do, do the homework and bring it with them. Then actually they can see that's, that is something that a lot of attention is paid to and they can understand why you take this and... (crosstalk) 

01:53:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:53:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...what they'll do with it and where it follows into the next session. 

01:53:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON I think that's right. The other thing I think is really important is to make the homework exercises a big part of the session... (crosstalk) 

01:54:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:00
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...not to just check them on the last minute 'cause it's a really important... (crosstalk) 

01:54:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:05
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...part of the work. It should take out sometimes a quarter or maybe a little bit more big session. 

01:54:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:10
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Uhm, the only thing I do which I know I you did too is to check the, the chart as understood by... (crosstalk) 

01:54:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...asking to repeat back what... (crosstalk) 

01:54:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...I've said. It is very important 'cause often they got hold with the wrong end of the statement... (crosstalk) 

01:54:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:54:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ... and when one hasn't put the, the messages over too well. 

01:54:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think the homework task can be particularly difficult when they're not writing things down and that can involve a lot of care in setting up because sometimes I think that young people can see their levels of literacy over the difficulties in literacy quite well. 

01:54:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

01:54:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN And so, we may often to record things and actually every word about spelling that they think they'll read better. And I think self-monitoring is a homework task that sometimes has particular problems. 

01:54:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. Well, that's when Emma(ph) actually done it. What do you do, what do you then? 

01:55:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Well, I think the first thing is check out why they haven't done this. I mean talk about what, was there something about it that was difficult? What was it that they thought they were going to do? And just listen to what they've got to say about it, really. I think that's, if I think is a really important piece of homework, then or particular important task, then what I do is rehearse with them when they might do it and how they might do it next time. So, in a way try and examine what the problems are around in homework and then try to make some kind of intervention, which means that they're more likely to remember or they're more likely to have the resources to do it. I think sometimes homework is also too difficult. 

01:55:35
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:55:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  And it can be difficult to children to admit that actually they're too difficult. 

01:55:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:55:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  And so, it may need breaking down or it may need sketching(ph) into the, their day in some kind of way... (crosstalk) 

01:55:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

01:55:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...or working at a particular time. They're going to do it or sometimes they even phoning in the weeks to, to see how they got on with it. 

01:55:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. Do you find them or do they, do they get them to phone you? 

01:56:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN It depends a bit. I think usually, I would not to persecute them by phoning up and saying, "Have you done your homework?" That sometimes, that can be useful. I think it... (crosstalk) 

01:56:10
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:56:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...depends a bit on the, on the individual situation or sometimes I might ask them to bring in and let me know. 

01:56:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON What about family? Sometimes if one gets the parents or mother usually involved, that can really switch the, the adolescence off. 

01:56:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. 

01:56:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Other times it is important. 

01:56:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN That's one of the problems with the, with the term "homework" really because... (crosstalk) 

01:56:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

01:56:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...I think that parents can sometimes think, it's homework so it's like math it stalls at the beginning, gets in and finished it... (crosstalk) 

01:56:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON All right. 

01:56:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ... without no understanding that it's the process of doing it that often the, the learning exercise for the patient. And so, sometimes there can be faulty performance oriented at home. 'Cause again, we may need to think about parents and confidentiality. Does the patient feel confident that they can write down their thoughts without having somebody else read it? 

01:56:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Right. 

01:56:55
Homework Problems Giving the right message: build into sessions from outset emphasise purpose Setting it up: allow enough time break task down as necessary check understanding & difficulties Task not done: explore reasons role of parents, confidentiality contact between sessions 

01:56:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  How about an unattended? I sometimes phone them and, uh, the, the, can't that we call a bit persecuted, in the other hand that they're quite surprise and it can... (crosstalk) 

01:57:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. 

01:57:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ... it can, they can, they can get back into treatment? 

01:57:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. I think at some sort it's a pleasant surprise when you really know... (crosstalk) 

01:57:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:57:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ... because it makes them realize that actually that you do care about how... (crosstalk) 

01:57:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yes. 

01:57:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...they are and they might be more likely to come.(crosstalk) 

01:57:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:57:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Other think always it persecute really. 

01:57:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. Certainly one of things I found repeatedly is the term that because the therapy anyway is relatively brief, that if you have a gap of a few weeks... (crosstalk) 

01:57:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:57:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...you've, you've lost because... (crosstalk) 

01:57:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:57:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...they have forgotten everything and you've got to restart therapy again.(crosstalk) 

01:57:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. So, whatever else one does, it's gonna happen fast. 

01:57:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  Yeah. 

01:57:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON They gonna get back, they're gonna come back in the treatment. They gonna get back fast. 

01:57:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. 

01:57:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Otherwise, they lose it out, lose it out. 

01:57:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think often, you know, as you know, we find in the early sessions that if people start feeling better, they stop coming 'cause they see they don't need to 'cause they feel better. And it's often important to think to explain that, that's quite likely to happen or it happens for some people and you feel like you don't need to come anymore but actually it's important that everybody learns how to cope with these feelings in case they come back again. And I think that, uh, teenagers are particularly prone to that... (crosstalk) 

01:58:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yes. 

01:58:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...because they, they can move on from it as soon as... (crosstalk) 

01:58:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:58:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...soon as they're feeling better. They're back doing the things that they want to be doing. 

01:58:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

01:58:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN It's something I don't want to think about.(crosstalk) 

01:58:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Hmm. So, what I think I'm seeing these cases is to predict getting better, uh, because you've, uh, set of kind of case school fuse(ph) seem to be a group, where the, the depression can often be quite be transient, they get better very fast.(crosstalk) 

01:58:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:58:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON And you lose, uh, lose esteem. So, I predict that, uh, they'll get better but that if they don't stay in the treatment, they'll get worse again. And that can sometimes be useful. I think this is assertive initial reluctance...(crosstalk) 

01:58:50
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  Uh hmm. 

01:58:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...uh, to come up to treatment? 

01:58:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think sometimes you just have to accept that people will droop out for a period and then they'll come back when they're feeling low again. And then, you can use the, the experience they've had of doing that to try and help them walk right away through the program the next time. I think sometimes you don't pick people up and see things through the first time, of, you know, the first time that they're involved with you in treatment. 

01:59:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON I think that's a terribly important point actually that depressed people sometimes their lives are disorganized or maybe beyond their control and if... (crosstalk) 

01:59:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:59:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...they miss a couple of points they get a letter saying we're gonna see you again. That's not terribly helpful thing to do. 

01:59:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN No. 

01:59:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON And some of those cases, we would leave the moment for a long time.(crosstalk) 

01:59:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

01:59:35
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON So, they've got the opportunity to come back and to treat those, as I have always find it very hard when there's been a big gap but if they're, if they're keen ... (crosstalk) 

01:59:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Right. 

01:59:45
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...tell them do come back and do quite well the second time around. 

01:59:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Sometimes it can be important to examine people's thoughts and feeling about treatments and they're often not can be, those can be very depressive thoughts that they're hopeless, you know, that we're not gonna be able to help them and then often, I think we can bring those, that sort of material into the content of sessions and use it as thoughts that can challenge in cognitive restructuring. 

02:00:10
Non Attendance act quickly to reestablish contact emphasise importance of completing programme examine attitudes to therapy within a cognitive framework give opportunity to return later 

02:00:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  There are other sort of issues that cannot (inaudible )therapist, well, once you've moved on beyond homework tasks and self-monitoring, it seems to me. 

02:00:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Well, you mean like getting stuck? 

02:00:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. Things coming up over and over again... (crosstalk) 

02:00:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

02:00:30
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...or feeling that the patient actually seems quite a lot better but is, you're going over the same material and your... (crosstalk) 

02:00:35
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Right. 

02:00:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...only part way there... (crosstalk) 

02:00:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

02:00:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...you've got seem to be moving on any further.(crosstalk) 

02:00:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. Uh, well, prevention is important. I think supervision is really critical.(crosstalk) 

02:00:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Yeah. 

02:00:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  And, uh, in a lot of sentence people won't have access to, uhm... (crosstalk) 

02:00:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:00:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...experience of event. Where if you can't somebody to talk it over with, uhm, it often very, it's... (crosstalk) 

02:01:00
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:01:00
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...it's usually very helpful, so I think that's critical if one can get supervision and particularly when things are getting stuck. 

02:01:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think we have also to remember that not everybody will recover fully that it may be that some that the partial improvement is the best that we can have... (crosstalk) 

02:01:15
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

02:01:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...hope for. That sometimes I think the supervision process will help people, will help therapists think that through... (crosstalk) 

02:01:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

02:01:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...and recognize the gains that have been made and perhaps, actually say, "Well, perhaps this is as far as we can go for the time being." It is important to bear that in mind. 

02:01:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. The other thing I think one, and one get stuck is to go back again and look at the initial assessment... (crosstalk) 

02:01:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

02:01:35
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ... one's initial formulation. Uh, one of the things I find sometimes happen to me is I get sort of drawn into setting unrealistic goals. 

02:01:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. 

02:01:45
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON With the adolescent you've set too many goals or they're really... (crosstalk) 

02:01:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Right. 

02:01:45
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ... obviously now unattainable and one needs to look and see what, what has been achieved and, uh, whether what hasn't been achieved. 

02:01:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:01:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON It was ever possible to actually... (crosstalk) 

02:01:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:01:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...get back. And I don't think, I think that's very true as you say is that, one has to recognize that some people won't be helped... (crosstalk) 

02:02:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:02:05
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...by these techniques and they may need the other forms, other forms of treatment. 

02:02:10
CHRISSIE VERDUYN I think one of the things as well that can be very helpful is setting up review sessions with the adolescent, which is that you've had five sessions to ten sessions and that you go over with them, the things that seem to help and things that don't haven't helped and the goals and actually their goals that they have now as well and... (crosstalk) 

02:02:25
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

02:02:25
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ... that, that part of, uhm, moving things on can't be sharing that process of review... (crosstalk) 

02:02:30
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Absolutely. 

02:02:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...and sometimes that can be very helpful. 

02:02:35
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. And sometimes involving parents in that process... (crosstalk) 

02:02:35
CHRISSIE VERDUYN  Hmm. 

02:02:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...too. 

02:02:40
CHRISSIE VERDUYN That's obviously important to get everybody's opinions about what change there has been... (crosstalk) 

02:02:45
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

02:02:45
CHRISSIE VERDUYN ...as well. But sometimes getting stuck is around other things that we haven't taken into account. That can be happening either at school or at home. 

02:02:50
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  That's right. I think particularly for home stressors. There's gonna one good... (crosstalk) 

02:02:55
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:02:55
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...factor that, that, uh, all can be very persistent. It's stress within the family. And well, may not be told or of underestimated the extent to which... (crosstalk) 

02:03:05
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Hmm. 

02:03:05
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON ...those are still very prevalent. And that's the point often to start involving, uhm, other people in the process of treatment. 

02:03:15
CHRISSIE VERDUYN Uh hmm. But I think we can't underemphasize the importance of seeing physician, you know, that we find that very helpful. 

02:03:20
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Yeah. 

02:03:20
CHRISSIE VERDUYN And I think in particular way being working with the same patient for an extended period of time, it can be possible, actually just not to be thinking about why they came in the first, first place or thinking about the process of therapist has gone along and that one of the things about supervision is it does actually keep you thinking about what is it you're doing and how you're working. 

02:03:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON Right. 

02:03:40
Issues later in therapy - "getting stuck" supervision review reassesses original formulation & goals build in review sessions with adolescent involve parents in review process treatment plan consider different treatment (poor response to CBT) involve other professionals (eg: re home/ school stresses) 

02:03:40
PROFESSOR RICHARD HARRINGTON  Well, that's the end of the training video. We've hoped you found it, uh, to be useful. Please remember that the video comes with the training manual, that it's important for you to consult a training manual when you're learning to use the techniques shown in this video. Remember also that it's important if you can to get supervision from somebody or if you can't get supervision then to link up with other people who are using Cognitive Behavioural techniques. The final thing to say is that we find in our clinical, uh, experience that it takes at least six months, uh, to become efficient using the technique shown in this videos but once therapists become proficient, uh, around two-thirds of cases are likely to respond.
