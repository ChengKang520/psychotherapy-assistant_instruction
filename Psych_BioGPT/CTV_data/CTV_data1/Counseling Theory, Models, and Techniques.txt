PATRICIA ROBEY Hi, I'm Dr. Patricia Robey. I'm an associate professor at Governors State University. And I'm here now to talk about counseling theory, counseling models and counseling techniques. So I'm happy to have you here again to talk more about theories and now the connection between theory counseling models and counseling techniques because they are very different things. To begin, I'm just going to review a little bit about what I talked about, about what is theory and so on, so we'll go through that and then I'm gonna be talking about some of the models in counseling. And then the importance of techniques and where that comes into play. So let's begin by reminding you about what is theory, it's an idea or set of ideas that's intended to explain phenomena and facts or events. Theories can be used to predict the future, can explain or guide action. A theory is presented as if it is true, but usually it cannot be true, proven to be true. However, they can be tested for accuracy, and they can be proven to be false. And as you recall, previously I talked about the fact that for many theorists they have an idea about what is causing human behavior and motivation based on their own experience and they put some of their hypothesis out into the world. They talk about them as if, it's actual fact, and I have to say for myself, when I first learned about that. I was a little bit confused because I didn't realize what a theory actually is. And that is just somebody's idea of what is the truth about human behavior and motivation. I remember going through the theories book and thinking well, it's in a book, it must be true. And that's not necessarily the case. As I mentioned, with Freud, he talks about an Id, ego, and super-ego, those are observations that he made about people's behavior, but not, can't necessarily be proven to be true in the same way that some other things that people have hypothesized about are not necessarily true. But they can be proven to be false. The interesting thing I have to say though is that the areas of theory that can be proven to be true, usually are related to behaviorism. Because you can do some experiments that will actually support whether or what somebody else has said to be true is actually applicable. So that goes into how we can experiment to see about the reality and the truth of theories. Umm… again we talked about, how counseling theories are developed through observing behavior over time. And I put this little drawing in here because I think it's an interesting thing to think about ourselves and how we understand things and how sometimes especially as students may be you feel like you're under a microscope much of the time. As your professors are looking at you and figuring out what are you doing? We create our own theories about you, as we're watching based on our way of understanding the world. But it is kind of an interesting thing to think about theorist looking at people to understand what makes them tick based on their own reality and what's going on at that time. We also talked before about the "Four Forces" of counseling Theory. The psychodynamic force, which was inside oriented and developed by Freud, Jung and Adler. The Cognitive Behavioral forces which is, uh, coming from the behaviorism of Skinner and then adapted to work with the mind and thinking in the cognitive behavioral approach, with the Albert Ellis and umm… Aaron Beck, William Glasser, Donald Meichenbaum. Existential Humanistic, the idea of freedom, responsibilities, search for meaning from the existentialisms and those people were Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, James Bugental. And then of course, the humanistic approach which is from Carl Rogers. And then of course, the fourth force which is the multicultural and postmodern perspectives which is what really is current right now. And an important way to think about no matter what your theoretical orientation is. And finally we talked about neuroscience as an emerging force in counseling the idea of what happens in the brain and then nervous system, neuroplasticity, how that's influenced by creativity. And how that then ultimately is going to influence everything that we do in counseling. So we also talked about why theory is important because it provides a lens through which we explain and predict human behavior and motivation. Provides a foundation for treatment by creating guidelines for assessment, helps to organize information, and structures a method for evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. And I mentioned to you before about how in my experience, understanding theory is so helpful for students, if you think about it yourself, you probably had experience with this and I know for myself, when I adopted choice theory and reality therapy as my way for working with clients, I knew exactly what to do. And it made my counseling so much more interesting and informed. So when my clients would come in, I already knew based on theories, some of the things that were going on with them. And it helped me also because with my theoretical approach and I think this goes to the post-modern and multicultural approach, the idea of client as expert. That one we think about theory when we know about it and we also can help our clients understand themselves through their theoretical lens. Then it puts us out at more collaborative perspective. And having a theory is like, when you… If you went to a doctor for example, and you went to the doctor and you said, tell me what you want to do, what's the best approach to working with this? The doctor might say, well, there is no best approach, there are a lot of different approaches, but the truth of the matter is that the approaches are all based on some sort of foundation of knowledge. And when you're going to a doctor would you feel confident, if you went to the doctor and you said what's the best approach and the doctor said, well, I don't know I'm going to open you up and we're kind of figure it out as I'm going through. You'd feel a little bit out of, out of whack, right? Because what you want is you want to go to somebody, who has a guiding principle, a way of understanding what's going on, something that's been proven over the course of time and that helps to direct what the doctor is gonna do. Well, similarly when clients come in to us they want to know that we know, something about what we are doing. And an interesting piece of that is the client expectation as they are coming in. So, uh, the idea of… Jeffrey Kottler wrote about this is that the counselor him or herself, provides an active placebo, he calls it. The idea that just by our very presence that we have something that it takes that's going to help the client to feel better almost immediately. And knowing that they are coming in, but that's not enough for a client to feel confident. So to be able to say to a client like I would do in an initial session, here is how I operate, here is what I understand. And part of what I would do, based on my theoretical orientation, is teach the client about him or herself over time. In fact, that's part of my counseling theory to be able to say, here's how, here's what I understand about what's going on, that relationship problems are at the core of what's going on including relationship with yourself. And so as we're going along, not only do I work therapeutically with the client draw from, but also give information from my theory to teach the client. So that ultimately the goal is for the client to be able to leave with the knowledge and techniques, if you will, to be able to be independent on their own. It's kind of an irony that… For some of us it feels like, well, if my client gets better, I'm out of business, but there is never any shortage of business for counselors. There's plenty of things, life experience going on in the world that will keep your clients coming back. And of course, referring you because if you know what you're doing, you operate from a position of confidence then you are more likely to have a practice where people will recognize that's a person I want to go and see. And that actually is regardless of your therapeutic approach. So this goes to why we need theory, why it's important and the other thing I want to really mention and emphasize is evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. We live in a time where the evaluation empirical evidence to support what works is critically important. There are a lot of factors that come into play, people are limited, right? By the time that they have to actually go and get counseling services. They are limited by their own resources. They are limited by interest. Umm… they are limited by beliefs about counseling, beliefs about themselves, if they go to counseling and so then to be able to do research that supports the evidence that you're putting forward about the effectiveness of theory, helps the profession over all. So as you think about, choosing your theory, and working with your clients, it's really good for you then to think about, what do I understand, what's going on, how do I understand what's going on, how do I measure that, how do I know, what information am I taking, how can I teach the client. For me, when clients leave and then they know something about themselves and they have skills and strategies to help them live better lives. I feel really great about that. Because when you do your job right, your client lives and your client has what they need, he or she needs to move forward in a more effective way. Okay, so we have counseling theories. Counseling theory provides a lens for understanding what we observe. But then we have another category of counseling, which is the counseling model. Now this is different because, the counseling model, well, it has a theatrical umbrella, the model provides a framework for why, how we operationalize our theory and, and how we conceptualize what's going on in real life situations. So this is an interesting thing because it's a kind of subset of what theory tells you. There's a lot of ways to put theory into action. And so again, now you're taking the overarching concept of the theory and you're saying, well, okay that fine, but what do I believe in, how I want to move this forward. And, uh, for example, from the choice theory approach, Glasser developed choice theory, he developed reality therapy first then he developed choice theory and so there's the concept of choice theory that tell me what's going on as the lens that I look through. And then there's the models of putting that into action. So for example, some people operate with the language of choice theory about, you know, they would ask, what is your quality world picture and so on, things that are relevant to that theoretical approach. But then, there's another model that's quite familiar to most counseling students, and that model is the WDEP model that was developed by Robert Wubbolding, who was the director of training for the Glasser Institute for many years. And using the WDEP model, it's not Glasser's, but it supports, it's supported by choice theory and is a way of organizing the choice theory process in counseling. So the WDEP model consists of asking the client, what is it that you want, what are you doing to get what you want, is it working, the evaluation component and what is your plan. And I'll talk more about this later. But another good example of models is, comes under the family systems prospective because there's, there is a lot of different ways of putting family system therapy into action. And I have to say to you that, I'm only touching just the tip of everything that's available because there's some much to talk about, this is a very limited brief introduction to these kind of things more to stimulate your thinking about what the possibilities are because umm… it's rich all of this with the theory, all of the models, everything you can do with them. And some of the models, you won't even see in your theories book, as I mentioned before. But let's just look it from the family perspective, systems perspective about the idea of models. So from the family systems perspective, we know that individuals are understood through assessing and understanding the interactions among family members, this is why they're so clever because they call it the family system perspective. As opposed to the individual one's. The behaviors of each member in the family is linked to others in the family. Problems reflect how the system functions. Any change influences the entire system. So all of you have families, it could be big families like mine, small families, whatever. I'm the oldest of six kids. And umm… what's interesting to me when I think about the family systems perspective is to think about some of the behaviors that we have over time. And how I am the result of my family system, and I'm the oldest of the six and umm… my parents were very fun, optimistic, they liked to laugh, they got a good sense of humor and lucky for me they passed that on to the rest of us. But there were six of us, five of us, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and then what I have call the whoopsy baby who came along when I was 13, much to my chagrin. But what was interesting is that to just think about who we are in the context of our family and what we look like now. And I'm the achiever, the second sister is the fun loving one, the third one is, kind of, the mediator, then there were… There's three girls and then there was a boy and then that changed the whole system up because the boy showed up. And then the little sister who was called Peanut, which kind of gives you an idea about her role in the system, right? But what was interesting about us in the way I look at us over time, is that you can see how our roles maintain over the course of the, of the years that we've had together. And maybe you can relate to some of these yourself, but one of the things that I find amusing now that I've learned a little bit about family systems, is to look at our behavior at Christmas, when we would come home to my mother's house. First of all, we all have a spot where we usually would sit and so when we would come in everyone would go to the spot. And it's been very interesting to see over time, how we've got comfortable with what the place is. I mean, literally, the physical space in the family that belongs to us. And I remember, my parents did, too. My dad had a place what he, where he would sit, my mom had a place, so he's here, here's mom, here's me over here. And so they all had a space. And there was a comfort in knowing, where we were all gonna go. And if somebody ever sat in someone else's space, it was disruptive. You might see this in the classroom too, if you ever sit in someone else's chair, it throws you kind of off. And I remember a time after my dad died and my mom had a new significant other and the first time that someone else sat in my dad's spot, and how painful that was to all of us kids in the system. Because we want it to maintain the way that it was. There is a concept of homeostasis, right? The system tries to maintain itself. And so that was kind of an instants of, of what that looked like. So umm… I'm really a product of my system, you could expect some certain things about me. When I was umm… I'm rule bound even as an adult rules are very important to me because I was the oldest one and rules, you know, were imposed. My parents said by the time my younger kid brother was born, they were too tired to impose the rules. And so you can just see how over time things change, but where you are in your system and understanding yourself through your system is really interesting. So any change influences the entire system, so for example, umm… my sister, my middle sister went to… She moved to California. And when she was in California, she lost the Midwestern piece of her and she became more like a California person, that's a different way of being, right? Because it's a different kind of social system and when she would come back, she would bring California with her. And I remember when she came back and, and she was talking in a different way, she was reacting to each, to all of us in a different way. And the system responded to that, in a way that was trying to maintain itself because we were very stoic mid-western people. Hi, it's nice to see you, You know, we want huggers, we eventually became huggers because I'm a counselor now. I've also changed the system, but it was very interesting to see how at different times things happen in the system that change the system. And one of those was just by the fact of her moving away and coming back and introducing different behaviors. And how we tried to keep her exactly the same and she refused to do that. So anyway, so that's a little bit about family systems perspective but what we are talking about models. So under the family systems perspective, there is a whole lot of different models that have been used over time. And umm… I like the idea of that little graphic because putting together all of those puzzle pieces is really how it is to think about families and how they work together. So the first one is the multigenerational family therapy system which was created by Murray Bowen and this is one that you're probably pretty familiar with because the primary thing that we do from that perspective, that almost everyone knows about is doing the Family Genogram. I remember when I was a… The genogram is like a family tree, right? So the idea of the genogram is to look at three generations and then Bowen's idea with this is that you can observe family patterns of behavior over time. And you can see the influence cross generationally about umm… you know, the parents of behavior and so once you get that insight into them, you're able to make some changes. So Bowen believed that, it's being able to separate from your family and get to have your own personal identity, differentiation is what he called it is something that comes from gaining insight into the family system as a whole. What's very interesting about Bowen is that he worked with schizophrenic families and in fact he would actually bring an entire family into the hospital to work with them. So if you think your family is interesting, you could imagine what that was like. So in my family of origin, when I did… and when I was counseling student and I did my genogram what was… Families are complicated, let me just say this. Families are complicated. And when I did my family genogram it became complicated in a hurry because I'm one of three sisters, who married three brothers. And so there was a lot of connecting to families that looked like it was… couldn't possibly be because how could you be related to this person, when this person was also related to this person. It was so complicated that at the bottom when I turned in it on wrote. I know this looks wrong, but it's actually right. And so you can… Well, because I was, uh, I had my theory about the professor that I better tell him, right? That that I was actually right. So, uh, but it was interesting to, to look at that and also to look at the characters that matched up with one and another. When we did those three sisters married to three brothers. So I as the eldest, married the eldest brother, the second sister married the second brother and the youngest sister married the youngest brother. So it was kind of an interesting thing to look at personalities and then how that influenced who we matched up with. It was also very interesting when there was a divorce in the family, when you have that kind of close knit relationship and how that charged up the system over time. So looking at the genogram which was really big and comprehensive, I could see how some of the struggles that we had really came from the values and beliefs that were passed down generationally, about how family should behave, what we should do, how we should relate to each other and how that then plays out in my life and what I choose to do. So it's really a powerful thing about the multigenerational family therapy and Bowens genogram. The next model I want to talk to you about is the human validation process model that was developed by Virginia Satir. Satir was such an interesting person because she brought herself to the session. In fact, she believed that techniques were secondary to the relationship with the family members and she was really spontaneous in the work that she would do. She use this intergenerational model and she brought family patterns to the present. The way that she did that though was very active and experiential, and some of the things that she would do would be family sculpting. So for example, she would take the family members, she would talk about a situation that was going on and instead of sitting and talking, she would say stand up and let's create that. And so she would have one of the members of the family who, may be who had brought the issue and she would say, bring the family up, put them in position of what it looks like and what it feels like to be part of this issue that's going on. And I remember being in training, we were just doing a role-play, but in my training we did a family sculpting experience and to be put in a position of a person who was angry or withdrawn, whatever it is. And then having to hold that pose was such a powerful thing because in holding that pose, you could feel the tension, you could feel it physiologically umm… even, you know, if you got frown or a smile or whatever it is, you could just experience. It was kind of a total body thing. And then to be able to observe, how other people were also in the pose, but the really other major thing that was happening associative with that was the person who was setting it up, because you knew that that was that persons perception of what was actually going on and that was how that person saw it. And I think the other thing that's very interesting about perception is that everyone in a family system has their own story, and their own perception about what is truth. So, uh, if, if you have siblings, if I went to you when I said, tell me all this, tell me a story about Christmas of 2014, what was it like? You might all have different stories because you all perceive things in a different way. I always think when I'm working with families, it's interesting when people say, well, we both… we all had the same parents. And that's not necessarily true, right? Because all the siblings are not the same individuals, so parents' parent for the individuals, but depending on their needs, who they are and so on. So umm… you can't, nobody can say we were raised exactly the same because we all bring different things. So any way, so Satir was very experiential, she thought of herself as a detective, she looked for self-esteem, the way the communication was of their clients. And umm… what's fun about this and I think it goes to creativity and counseling is that she brought that to her. She was really spontaneous in the techniques that she used, but that was uniquely hers. Not everybody could bring that kind of work to counseling in the way that Satir did. And there's a lot of videos out and, and all of these theorist. So if you go to YouTube even you could probably find examples and if you're as visual is I am, it's very helpful to be able to see these kind of approaches and models and theories in action. Uh, okay. So another experiential person, so experiential that he put it into his approach, experiential family therapy was Carl Whitaker. So he was also very freewheeling, intuitive. He actually used existential therapy and theory to apply to his work with families. Looking at choice, freedom, self-determination, growth and actualization, and his goal was to facilitate autonomy while retaining a sense of belonging in the family. So this is kind of an interesting thing because similar to Bowen who was looking at the differentiation, his goal was to have the family and, you know, become their… Family members become their own entities while still having that relationship with the family. He had no specific techniques… How cool is that, right? In fact, existentialists don't have specific techniques. They borrow from their toolbox and they could use a lot of different things as long as it's consistent with what they want it to do. But he also believed which is really the belief from counseling now, that the relationship with the therapist is the primary influence on making a difference in the client's life. So then we have somebody else that you're probably familiar with. Salvador Minuchin, who developed Structural Family Therapy. Minuchin… Excuse me. He developed this therapy in the '60s through his work with Delinquent Boys from poor families in New York. He focused on the structure and the organization of the family and what he tried to do is to help the family modify the stereotypical patterns of behavior. So he looked at relationship among family members, umm… one of the things that you might be aware of from his approach is family hierarchy, umm… you've probably heard of parentified children. This is the idea where the child then becomes in a parentified role. He looks to see if the parents are working together or separately, boundaries, whether boundaries are rigid or permeable. And so those are some things you are nodding though that are pretty standard and things that you believe and have experienced. And then finally a more recent approach is the strategic family therapy which is from Jay Haley and Cloe Madanes. So they blended… Haley blended the structural model with the concepts of the hierarchy and power and so on. But the strategic approach is kind of a pragmatic approach that focuses on solving problems in the present. So you can see now we are moving more toward the post-modern way of working. A present oriented, not worried about, understanding what was going on in the past or insight from the past, but taking it where we are and moving forward. Cloe Madanes established the family institute with Jay Haley in the 1970s and this… their work was kind of like a brief therapeutic approach and became very popular in the 1980s. Probably, very much because of that because as they are moving forward then, you know, this is goal now, it is to move forward and help dealing with the problems. Considering the post-modern approach, the idea is that problems in the family are real as opposed to a symptom of underlying issues. And that problem can be solved. And so they work on reorganizing family structure through interventions as joining with clients, reorganizing hierarchy, setting boundaries, performing reenactments which is similar to the family sculpting. So these again are there's theory which is the family systems theory of how it works, these are models which is how the theory is conceptualized and put into action. And then what he did mention is the post-modern inventions which are very similar to the strategic thing which is working from a not knowing position, client as the experts and working with the family. And the now to make changes that are going to influence what's going on in the future, so present and future oriented. All right, so now we get to the fun stuff because all of these things that we've been talking about had been how do I know, what's going on in my client's lives? But techniques now are the interventions used in counseling to put the theories and models into action. So Rock and Roll, right? All… Every… Once you go to the theories course, you're just like, okay, that's good, interesting to know. But when students get into their beginning counseling skills, they do peer counseling, it's like, okay, I'm getting going, I'm going to actually try this now and then when the first experience comes and we're actually working with the client from the community. Now you get to put… kick your creativity into gear and start using techniques. Techniques are different from theory. Techniques are what you do, not how you think, theory is what you think, right? So techniques are also associated with the theoretical approach that you have, but you also have the option of choosing techniques from other interventions and other theories depending on what works along with your line of thinking. So for example, here is a look at Cognitive-Behavioral theory and techniques. One of the things that I have my students do is when they read their books on their theory that they've chosen is I have them make a chart so that they can understand how they are thinking and what techniques are associated with the thoughts, okay? And I really encourage you to do something like this as you're learning about your own theoretical approach or thinking about what you're doing because when you understand the theory and when you identify the technique, you begin to develop parents of thinking that really helps you so that's your… like driving, once you understand all the systems of your car then you're able to drive your car more effectively in the direction you want to go, right? So this is how you think about how the car operates this is what you do to keep the car going. So for example then, so we are looking at cognitive behavior, so the theory says human beings are born with the potential for both rational thinking and irrational thinking, so what do we do? So in counseling, we help the client acquire a more realistic and workable philosophy of life. What is the evidence that supports this belief, right? So if we're looking to help the client to get more rational way of thinking, we ask, well, where is the evidence. If you can find any evidence that support your belief, then you know that that's not a rational way to, to work, so then you say, well, how else can you look at it? So you can see how you really changed the thinking. So we understand that irrational beliefs are learned from significant others through childhood. They become schemas that determine behavior. So again, encourage the clients to identify your rational ideas and challenge the validity, assist them in recognizing the illogical nature of their thinking. I mean, see how empowering that is, because you know this, you know these things before the client even comes in, if you're operating from the cognitive behavior perspective. So as long as you know that, you can explain everything. I mean, if I were a Cognitive-Behavioral person, I would know all of you through that lens right now, that you all have some irrational thinking. But I won't judge you that way. So umm… clients are unaware of their automatic thoughts. I mean, maybe for some of you, you are going oh, you know what, that could be me. So we use psychoeducation to help them understand. So you see that there is a specific link between theoretical thinking and the techniques that you put into action. Now some approaches are really full of techniques that are identified and so I thought it would be interesting for you to take a look at some of the Adlerian techniques. And there's a bunch of them. Some of them are… I mean, you can see where some of them are playful, but also meaningful. I'll just point out umm… asking the question is, is the technique that could be used in a lot of different situations, so asking the question, what would be different if you, if you like turn out the way that you wanted it to be. This I love the idea of the funniest joke. You ask the client to tell the funniest joke that they know. Now if you think about that, think about the funniest joke you know, it would tell me a lot about you when you tell what your funniest joke is, right? Is it, you know… And so experiences like that. One of the things I like to do is to ask people what their favorite movie is because in understanding what people chooses their favorite movie and why it's so important, gives me a look inside at what values they have. It's a nice way of connecting without having that traditional umm… over the table, over the desk kind of umm… relationship. Umm… higher standards than God, so do you think that you know, for, this is for people who spiritual, you know do you think that God creates people who are generally good. If you're judging yourself, are you better than God. You have higher standards than God, you don't accept yourself even though God would. So you could see how that plays into it. So there is a lot of real interesting things that they do. And umm… so that's just some other techniques and imagine having that then in your toolbox to choose from. And you can see that some of these things would be umm… applicable to many different theoretical approaches. And so here we go. So look at that treasure chest. You can borrow techniques from a lot of different theoretical approaches, as long as it makes sense to your theory. So for example, from a choice theory perspective, umm… I wouldn't be looking into some bodies past, we don't do dream analysis because we don't, we don't focus on the unconscious. If we are going to talk about dreams, I'd ask the client what do you think that means and ask questions because in my approach, the client is the expert on his own. I don't interpret for the client, even though I might have some good ideas. So isn't that fun because then when you think about it, you can adopt a lot of different things. And so I put some of the things that I like in my umm… approach to counseling that come from different places. So for example, the miracle question from the solution focus approached. If you were to wake up tomorrow morning, you all kind of know that question and your problem was solved, how would you know? I know that's not exactly the right language, but that's, that's the point. Play therapy, I'm a big fan of play therapy and even though the idea behind umm… using playful techniques comes from a Jung perspective of understanding the metaphorical nature of toys or whatever you are using. From a choice theory perspective, I know how it works just because it tells the story. And I say what is the story and then I direct through my play therapy. Psychodrama, we talked about that with the sculpting, you know, okay show me what would look like, empty chair, journaling, acting as if, so that's, you know, kind of the fake it if you make it kind of thing. Use the paradox, prescribing the symptoms, making contracts, genograms. I love genograms because they tell the story. And all of my students are required to do genograms with at least one of their clients and everybody reports how useful it is to do a genogram because it's a quick way of understanding what's going on, you know, in a client's life. Umm… so you can see, enactments, psychoeducation, mindfulness, role-play, and using smart goals. Okay, so Integrative Approaches, so umm… we talked about this a little bit before about the eclectic approach. And we don't use the language of eclectic approaches. But instead what we would talk about is integrative. And so there is a couple of ways of doing this. The first is the theoretical integration, blending two or more established theories into a unified point of view. So for example, choice theory can be integrated with person-centered therapy. Now the thing is that those work together because they are… they're not inconsistent, right? So I can be a humorous that's part of the nature of the choice theory relationship piece. And so I can believe in congruence and all of those kind of things it works well with choice theory. But I understand why that works because of my choice theory lens. So it's not like it's completely different. So, and then the idea of technical eclecticism. Now this is a little bit, this is different than theoretical. So I want to point that out. This is the use of a collection of techniques that work well together without synthesizing theory. So for example, the multimodal approach, basic idea of Arnold Lazarus is something that you'll see. And here is his approach. So he looks at all these areas of functioning and you can see how he's got the behaviorism, he focused on affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonal relationship, drugs/biology. Umm… we'll go back to that again. And so the idea of this is that he's looking at a lot of different things that are covered in a lot of different theories, right? And so with that he gets. This is an assessment, so he gets a broad idea of the functioning of a client by looking at these different ways of being. And actually this approach kind of falls under the behaviorist or cognitive behaviorist kind of therapies. Okay. And then finally this… the problem is with integration is you have to consider all of these things about cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions, if they don't, if they don't match you can integrate them because that would, that's two different things and then they are going to bump heads as opposed to smoothly come together. So you need to consider this without an in-depth knowledge of theories, it is difficult to form this kind of approach and think about how hard it is to even understand one theory let alone to understand more than one theory and figure out how it works together. And, uh, finally, beginning counselors benefit from having the structure of one theory. So my mom used to say tick one tock at a time and that's kind of how I feel about this. You know just do one thing, do it well, move forward. Isn't that kind of a nice saying? Tick one tock at a time kind of implies a little bit of a easy way of being in the world. So, uh… So finally, I just want to say, this is… After all, this talk about theory, it's kind of interesting to know, no specific theory or form of treatment has been shown to be more effective than others. Now even Dr. Glasser, my mentor, the developer of choice theory. He wrote a nice little book called "A mental health," and in the back of it he says, "There are many very effective therapies." So I thought that was pretty cool of him to do that after, of course, he wrote the little booklet about choice theory, but to acknowledge that there is a lot of good work that other people are doing. Glasser was honored as an honorary Adlerian, one year at the Adlerian Conference. And Jon Carlson who was an Adlerian was honored as an honorary Glasserian at the conference that we had the following year. So that just goes to show how we could all embrace different things. We don't have to be in competition with each other. And so interestingly the factors that account for change in therapy are number one, the client factors. So how does the client view the world, is the client optimistic or pessimistic, those things that they, they bring in, culture background and so on. Therapeutic relationships, 30%. Isn't that nice that to bring yourself into the session is what's really going to make a difference? Who you are? Is… Such an important thing. And from my professional approach, the choice theory approach relationship is the key so that fits right in so how nice to know that if you can just go in and meet their client where they are, where they are, it's, it's wonderful. And most clients come to us because they don't they have good relationships outside, right? Somebody who's not listening anymore or tired of listening. Client expectancy factors. If the client is hopeful and beliefs that things are going to change in therapy, they are more likely to make change. It's very interesting that so much depends on their expectancy and what they are willing to do. The other thing I think that's helpful to know about this is that when you are evaluating your work to understand that so much has to do with client factors and expectancy, that you can actually be doing really good work. But if the client has decided, I'm not going to change whatever else, and of course, your theory tells you why. But you can know that you're doing good work, regardless of whether the client chooses to change or not because we really tend to be hard on ourselves if things aren't working. And then finally, the theoretical model that you choose is about 15% of what contributes to change in therapy. So that said, theory is important, going back to all the way up to beginning because it's important not only for the client, but for you as the counselors to know what you're doing and how to put it into action. So we've covered a lot in this segment and I appreciate your paying attention. And at this point, we have some time for questions, if anybody has any. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I have a question. Uh, what is your favorite technique? 

00:45:40
PATRICIA ROBEY Well, that's a good question. And I, I have a lot of… I'm a very experiential kind of a counselor. And so there is a lot of things I like to do. I like be really active, but one of the things that I really like to do the most is sand tray, which comes from the play therapy approach. And umm… what this is, literally, is to have like a sand, a tray that has sand in it and it's a waterproof tray so you can add water whatever else and umm… associated with that is I have a collection of miniature toys. So umm… I have so many toys because I pick them up wherever I go. And the toys are people, places, things, trees, dogs, animals anything that you can think of that represents something in the world. And that are small enough, that's why we call a miniatures to fit into a tray. And the thing about them is that the miniatures themselves are subject to the interpretation of the person who chooses them, so umm… people are told then to put the objects into the sand depending on what you hope to accomplish. So this is where the intention of the intervention is so important. So I'll just tell you a common one that we might do to get to know the client, is to say create your world in the sand. And so using the miniatures and the clients can look through all the miniatures and then they create their world as they see it in the sand by their placement of the different miniatures in the different place. And so as they do that, the process of creating the sand tray is almost as important as the sand tray itself because when I watch clients as they're very carefully choosing the miniatures that represent what they want to put in there, it tells me a lot about what they are thinking and what's going on for them. So taking that idea of create your world in the sand, they put the miniatures where they want into the box and then you can talk about that in terms of, you know, debriefing asking questions about what does this mean and so on. And then you look at the placement, the things that are in the center are typically the most important things and peripherally. And I'll tell you, I, I use sand tray a lot because it's like a genogram in the sense, that it can be kind of a shortcut to understanding things. One of the most significant things that ever happened was when I was working with the client who was suffering from grief and loss issues. And so not surprisingly, her sand tray was full of things that represented… There was a lot of Halloween figures in there and skeletons and there was a casket and so on. And umm… when I asked her about that, she did talk about the grief and loss, but over in the corner was an item that I won't say exactly what it was confidentiality, but it was… say it was a magic wand. Something that I personally would have assumed meant something like magical or something that could happen, wish fulfillment or whatever else. So that was kind of how what I thought it was going to be and it was over in the corner all by itself. And so the critical piece that's important about doing something like this is asking the question. Because when I asked her the question about what that meant, it meant something totally different. It meant her wish for her life to be different for something that had happened not to have happened. And that had never come up in all the weeks of counseling that we had together until she did that sand tray. And so it provided an opportunity for something to be brought forth, in a way that just talking, even though the relationship was good, we've done a lot of good work. She had never brought that forward and when she was talking through the metaphor of the magic wand, and her wish for experience, there was a richness then that was added to our work together. And also, gave me some insight into what she needed to do for herself because associative death with that was a lot of self blame umm… and I recognized few of my theoretical lens that… through my lens we talked about the, the problems that people have with relationships and in particular, the problem relationship can be with the self. So through that metaphor of that miniature, she started to talk about her relationship with the self and about how she felt not good enough and part of herself had died along with the friends. And so, and then we can work on that because the next step is if you could change your world to be the way that you wanted it to be, you see the shift of focus, show me how that would be. And so we took it from the problem based, the world that she sought to now create a different world. And then she's picking out the pieces I could see the shift in energy that came from working through that way. And to me, that's one of the exciting things of working through my theoretical approach is that we move from the don't want, which is what clients know when they come in, right? To what is it that you do want? So the world that she had was the world that she put in the sand first, the world that she wanted then when she created that, we moved from the don't want to the do want. Now we can start to build hopefulness. Now we can start to make plans for action. And through that pivotal moment that happened as a result of that sand tray, our whole work shifted. Because now she started to create then the idea of what direction she want to go in instead of being stuck in the problem-based picture. So I like play therapy. I'm like very experiential again and umm… it's a great thing. So I really encourage everybody to take a look at play therapy. It's really applicable across theories. And a lot of fun and get you a long way in a short amount of time. So thanks for asking that question. And thanks to everybody for your attention. I was excited to share with you my interest again in theoretical approaches and models and techniques.
