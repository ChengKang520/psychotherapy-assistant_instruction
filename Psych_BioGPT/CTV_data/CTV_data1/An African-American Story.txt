00:00:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Welcome to the interview. Uhm, I'm very pleased that Dr. Janet Helms has agreed to be interviewed, here before a very large audience, here at the Third Annual Institute for The Study, the pro, The Study and Promotion of Race and Culture. Can an understanding of race, as distinguished from ethnicity and former understanding of professional practice in psychology, and if so, for what purpose? With the conviction that has cons, that has encountered disparagement, uhm, by race scholars of 21st century and our forbearers, there is a need to bring light to this phenomenon and to have an understanding of its impact to human life to our relationships and to the functioning of societies. Race is present, it's fluid, it's dynamic, it intersects in complex weights(ph) with other forces that shapes our existence. Today, we have an opportunity to learn more about race from a very special guest, the founder and director of the Institute. Dr. Janet Helms is professor of Counseling Psychology at Boston College. She is an architect of a psychology of race, and notably an applied theory, that can conserve us not only in making sense of the phenomenon, but also equipping us with tools to dismantle it. In this interview, I intend to guide the audience to an understanding of Helm, Dr. Helms' work. Her contributions include a multitude of books, book chapters, articles, presentations, workshops. A coveted scholar and educator, Dr. Helms' theory and research on racial identity theory has influenced scholars and practitioners alike across various disciplines, not only here in the United States, but also in other countries, racialized countries like Brazil, uhm, South Africa, New Zealand. During this interview, I will ask Dr. Helms to address some of the rudiments of racial identity theory, aspects that I believe, are often misunderstood or misinterpreted. A second but equally important goal of the interview is to find out about Dr. Helms, the person. It's my objective to examine what drives her, how she manages to openly scrutinize and seek answers to difficult questions, within different context to which race is addressed, and these are the context in which race is often codified, avoided, minimized, diminished, and sometimes, even exaggerated. And this is where I'd like to begin and I thank you again for agreeing to be a part of the interview. I wanna start by asking you about, you, the person. 

00:03:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS Oh. (laughs) 

00:03:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON You're from Kansas City, Missouri. 

00:03:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS The real Kansas City. 

00:03:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON The real Kansas City, that's right, (laughs) as opposed to the other one. 

00:03:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Could you please share with us what it was like growing up in Kansas City during the time when you grew up, what sort of the, the local dynamics that was occurring, as well as the socie, the societal dynamics occurring at the time when you were there? 

00:03:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, the dynamics were kind of fluid(ph). Uhm, contrary to what people believe, I did grow up after the Civil War. (laughs) And in fact, uhm, most of my education happened after Brown versus, ah, Topeka ah, decision. So one would have thought that I grow up in integrated schools, which I did not, uhm, I mainly grew up in predominantly in black schools until about high school, but I learned a lot about racial dynamics by growing up in a predominantly black school system. And what I learned was that, even under segregation, which essentially was what we had in spite of the law, school, black schools were not entirely segregated. What would happen is that the white students who were kicked out of the white schools would be sent to the blacks schools. And what we learned, or what we were often told there was that, uhm, somebody's White child was coming to the school, and we should be nice to them because white people were smarter than black people. I always found that intriguing because, I, not only did I get, ah, better ah, test grades than the white students who were sent to study with us, but I could also beat them up (laughs) because I have, I have four brothers, and so they taught me how to, how to box... (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Oh, I see. 

00:05:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...uhm, it was always astonishing to people that I didn't fight like a girl. I boxed. 

00:05:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) I see. You're talking about a contradiction that occurred, the contradiction was what you were told, and what you actually saw in reality. 

00:05:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS The contradiction was what I was told and what I saw in reality, and the fact is, we would be taught, told on a regular basis how white people differed from black people, and I was always intrigued by that and I'd have to ah, ah, try to prove them wrong. So I remember very clearly that one of my first grade teachers had a child who was being educated in a predominantly white system, and she was telling us what good readers the white children were because they could read their books upside down. So I said well, if they can read upside down, I can read upside down, and so in our next reading group, I turned my book upside down and I was reading and she said, " Why is your book upside down?" and I said " I wanna read like the white children read." And so, uhm, always there was this notion that there was this other who was supposed to be superior, and me challenging whether or not that was, that was the case. 

00:06:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Well, that's interesting. You said by the time you get to high school, you were in more integrated setting. 

00:06:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS By the time I got to high school, I was in a more integrated setting. I was probably the first of my, ah, sibling cohort to go to a predominantly White school. Uhm, there were actually seven of us. I don't know if I've mentioned that, (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:07:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS ah, two families, ah, three brothers and me, and then my two sisters and another brother. So I was the first to actually enter an integrated high school. Uhm, integrated high school was not fun. 

00:07:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON No. 

00:07:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS I learned for instance that you can work as hard as your white peers, and even harder and still not get the same ah, consequences out of the experience. Uhm, that was probably a good lesson to learn but it didn't feel particularly good at the time. 

00:07:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:07:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS I learned that, uhm, periodically, when white teenagers were angry about whatever it is that they were angry about, they usually would come over to the integrated high school and we would get a warning that the black students ought to hurry home because ah, the white kids were going to attack them. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:07:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS So there was that kind of violence that was potentially in the air too, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Did it happen? Did, did you actually have cases were it was or was it just these empty threats? 

00:08:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS There were actually cases where they would show up with chains, uhm, and we would, ah, try to hide and not be victimized by that. As, and as far as I can tell, no one ever actually got attacked, but there was always that potential. And so, in some sense, there was that fear over our heads. Uhm, white high school was also where I learned that no matter how well I had done in the predominantly white or black schools, which I had done very well in, that I had to prove myself all over again. I learned for instance that, in white high school, an A, there are different kinds of A's. There are A's that count for four points and there are A's that count for five points. So that, ah, if you were in what were called special classes, your grades actually counted more than if you were in regular classes. I was in the regular classes, which meant that I could have A's in all of my classes, which I pretty much did, but not be in the top of the class because I wasn't in the, in the classes that, ah, had higher point values. Uhm, it actually took white teachers, who saw my potential, to lobby for me in order for me to get into the more advanced classes, and I was on a one-by-one basis. So I guess I also learned that it's good to have, ah, what I would call them now, ah, white people with advanced levels of racial identity who can advocate for one insist unless where one can't advocate for oneself. 

00:09:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  And you were lucky to have someone, or some people who were doing that? 

00:09:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS I was lucky to have some people who were doing that. 

00:09:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Uhm, I'm gonna get to more about the levels because you're talking about lot of fluidity and you mentioned that when you first talked, but I wanna definitely in-store that more. I wanted to ask about your, your roots, your, your ancestral roots. 

00:10:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS  My ancestral roots? 

00:10:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. (laughs) Ethnicity. What, what's in the family? What's... (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah. 

00:10:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON ...do you have there in person. 

00:10:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, in as far as I can tell, there's a lot in the family. Uhm, there's some Cherokee, there's some Lakota. On my mother's side, ah, we can trace our ancestry back to the first enslaved African (coughs) men. Ah, there's some Irish, there's some German, uhm, there's some more Cherokee on the other side. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON There's a lot. 

00:10:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS So, there's a lot there. Uhm, the way that we are taught understand that is that we were Black Americans, and be Black Americans meant that you were mixed up with a whole lot of, a lot of people. 

00:11:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh-huh. 

00:11:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, the language changed eventually for some people, not for my mother ah, but for some people to African-American, meaning that, uhm, essentially, our racial category was that we were a mixture of people, ah, who was African, this was central in, in who we were. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes(ph). 

00:11:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS  So I think about my race actually as being Black or African- American, and my ethnicity is being black or African-American. To me, they're not different terms. I usually prefer to use "black" because when I'm writing, it takes up fewer words in a manuscript. 

00:11:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) I do that too. Right. (laughs) You're, you're saying something about, ah, this phenomenon of race, in terms of what you identify yourself as, because you could certainly very well call yourself Native American or Cherokee, but I think that maybe there is some laws against that. 

00:11:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Well, I don't know that there are any laws against that. I could actually call myself whatever I want but people would say I was crazy, and so it wouldn't particularly be helpful to me. (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Precisely. 

00:12:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS People race is such a social construction that people tend to call you what they see. It doesn't really matter what the reality is, (coughs) and because that's the case, in some senses, unless I want to irritate people, it's easier for me to, ah, be what people see... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS And what people see is, is Black or African- American and, ah, ah, that, that works for me. 

00:12:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON It works for you. 

00:12:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS It works for me. But the other part of that is, because I know that I have all of these other kinds of roots, I think it makes me, makes it easier for me to see the positive in other kinds of people. 

00:12:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm, say more about that. 

00:12:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, how can you be mad at a whole group of Native Americans, if in fact you know that some of your people are Native American? How can you be mad at a whole group of, of Irish people if you know that some of your people are Irish? So if you can get, if I can get in touch with my, ah, ancestral roots, as you call them, then it's easier for me to, sometimes understand that even if people are not being nice to me, that doesn't mean that the whole group is not being nice to me. Or even if a person's negative experiences are not impacting me directly, maybe I should fight for that person anyway because, in a sense, their negative experiences are impacting me. 

00:13:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I see. So you're embracing ah, humanity by identifying with, ah, your roots, your ancestral roots in some way. 

00:13:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Tsk, well, that sounds nice. (laughs) I'll, I'll, I'll take that. I like that. 

00:13:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Okay. You started to do some defining of race. Could you go further in that, to that? Defining race for us. 

00:13:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I actually think race is a social construction. Ah, social construction, ah, built around observable physical characteristics... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...that people use in order to maintain a status hierarchy. I think it's fluid(ph). I think race changes depending on what the society needs. Ah, probably everyone in this room, except maybe the African-American people, and even some of them actually had been something else, some other race at sometime in, in the history of the United States. (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:14:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS So, it's a social construction. 

00:14:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  It changes. 

00:14:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS It changes. It's a, it's a system, I think, for allowing domination to happen in the society. 

00:14:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uhm, let's flow next into you, you used the term "sociorace". 

00:14:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS I used sociorace. 

00:14:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay, and sociorace is to emphasize the. 

00:14:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS That we treat people differently depending on how they look. So, uhm, there are laws for instance that are estab, established on the basis of how people look. There are do's and don'ts that we learned early on in our socialization that revolve around how people look. So I use, uh, socio-race to talk about the socio, socialization process that centers around the issues of race. 

00:15:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Okay, all right. And that contrast to popular conception of biological, ah, in association with biological or sort of deterministic idea of what race is. 

00:15:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, I think the general societal definition is that there are biologically defined races, that in fact, there is some genetic component that makes us one group rather than another group. (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:15:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, it's a kind of mental illness, I think, particularly in US society because the notion is that we were, ah, distinct, biologically distinct racial groups. When in fact, if we were all to take our paper, I won't ask everyone to do this, but start listing our ancestry, we will find that there's somebody in all of our ancestral trees who would be another race than we think of ourselves as being. 

00:16:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:16:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS So it's, it's a fiction. 

00:16:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON It's a fiction... (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS It's a fiction. 

00:16:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON ..set up. One of the things that we look at some of the headlines and we see so many headlines coming through, we can start to pinpoint the traumas of race, and there's lots of traumas associated with race. One of those traumas ah, has to do with who matters most along this hierarchy, It's not a big mystery, is it? (laughs) 

00:16:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, depending on when in history you want to talk about who matters. 

00:16:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Well, I'm thinking in particular about, (inaudible ), the extreme(ph) case, you know, the Southern Poverty Law Center that talks about the increase in hate crimes, and there are, there's increased hate literature. There are Hitler dolls that are being created and distributed and so forth, and yet, we seem to have such strong opposition to getting hate crime legislation passed. Uhm, is that sending out some message about who matters or what becomes important for us, especially in terms of potentially resolving some aspect of racism that's overt violence? 

00:17:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, you know, I don't necessarily see it as a change. We've never, for instance had, had the law passed against lynching people. We don't have anti-lynching legislation. So in some sense, the, the, who matters has always been a constant. It just change its shapes, (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:17:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS if, if that makes any kind of sense. 

00:17:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON It changes shapes in terms of the different. (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS  It, it changes, it, it changes shapes in terms of how one is allowed to express hate crimes. Uhm, in, uhm, the last hundred years, it was okay to string people up on trees. Now, you can drag them behind trucks. (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS So it isn't just that, uhm, it went away and now it's come back. It's that it's never gone away. 

00:18:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I see. That's an interesting perspective. Uhm, another headline, I recall reading, uhm, that, to me invoke this idea of how we have, we create this invisibility about whites and about what the connection of whites to identifying racially and also in terms of their role with race, and that was an article that was called "The Asians are killing us" or something like that where, uhm, ah, there was a woman, a white woman who was, ah, played in a Professional Golfing Organization, who was saying that ah, Asian golfers lacked sex appeal, uhm, and that people weren't as interested in watching the, this organization, the LPGA champion tour because, uhm, Asians didn't seem to have the ah, charisma or the sex appeal that others, and of course that "others" is not identified. So, uhm, some of the language that gets put out there seems to talk, there's an invisibility, but importantly, uhm, the person who made this, I would suspect that she wasn't considering what she was saying about herself, as a White. In other words, by stating that Asians were this way, that she as a white woman, and other whites are, are another way. 

00:19:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS She was confessing something about herself and other, ah, white people. 

00:19:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON That's right. 

00:19:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I'm not quite sure what to say about that. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yeah. 

00:19:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, Asian women golfers don't turn me on but VJ Singh is pretty cute, so... (laughing) 

00:19:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. (laughs) 

00:19:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Which I suppose says something about me... (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Right. 

00:20:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON ...uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, the other thing too is the invisibility, and Patricia Williams is a legal scholar who talks about this idea of, uhm, of, of hyper-visibility on the one hand and invisibility on the other, and that she's referring to people of color, and I believe she's referring to African-Americans in particular. Uhm, (coughs) one way that, uhm, hyper-visibility occurs, I believe she's suggesting, is by making invisible the, the author, especially the whites, uhm, and it's not necessarily only by whites, right? 

00:20:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS So you're asking me about invisibility of whites, or invisibility of people of color? 

00:20:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON It, it seems like it's connected, wouldn't you say? (coughs) 

00:20:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, I think, I think whites are invisible to themselves, but I think they're probably quite visible to people of color. On the other hand, white people can make people of color invisible or visible depending on what they need them to be. Uhm, in my life for example, I am frequently invisible in public places unless someone needs me to serve them in some way. 

00:21:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, so, I can be, to give you an example, I can be in an airport line waiting for my ticket, and it's not unusual for people just to walk past me and, and go forward. Uhm, they don't see me. Occasionally, someone would point out to them that I'm standing there and they will look back with amazement and say things like, "Well, she wasn't there when I got here," when obviously I was there when they got there... (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON All right. 

00:21:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...so I'm invisible. But the other thing that I find intriguing, you know that directions are not my strong suit, but people in that same airport will ask me how to get to somewhere. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Ahh. 

00:21:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS So they need me, and suddenly I am, I am visible. 

00:22:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I see. So yes, for the purposes, people of color, for the purposes of, for whites. When you wrote the racial identity, ah, you, you, in 1984, you wrote an article where you, uhm, started with Dr. Cross' model Black Nigrescence, ah, Psychological Nigrescence. You created the white racial identity model and you talked about an interaction, something that was occurring there. Uhm, that later, turned to a people of color model, and I wanna talk about that later. But, uhm, what happened? How did, how did this get created? Why did you, did you think to create such a model, an interaction model? 

00:22:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS Let me just do a minor correction. I, the people of color did not actually replace the black identity model... (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:22:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS ..and so we may talk about that later. (crosstalk) 

00:22:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:22:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, so how did I create the... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes, what, what prompted, what prompted that? 

00:22:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...the interaction model or... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes, the, the interaction model in particular. 

00:23:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...uhm, actually, as you probably know, the models grew out of, uhm, actually my work as a therapist, a counseling psychologist, and there were lots of theories in the 70's and 80's that talked about how race impacted the counseling process. But most of those theories talked about it as though all Black people would interact with all white people, and all white people would interact with all Black people in exactly the same ways. And these articles were written for white therapists. So they would say for instance, well, when a black client comes in, this Black client is going to be angry and aggressive because you're a white person and they just won't be able to work with you. I knew that was not necessarily the case because many Black clients were working with white therapist and many white therapist were working effectively with Black clients. And so I thought we needed a more complex way of conceptualizing what that process might be like. And so ah, uhm, ah, Bill Cross' theory helped me think about the process with respect to Black people. Uhm, the thinking about ah, White people actually came about accidentally. Uhm, you wanna know about that? (laughs) 

00:24:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. (laughs) I would, yes. 

00:24:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, Thomas Parham and I actually published the first study in which black racial identity was measured or at least, uhm, in a well, well known journal. And in response to that, people would send me comments saying, "Well, why are you studying black identity, you ought to be studying white identity". Ah, actually, the first set of reviewers said that. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:24:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I didn't really wanna study white identity but I didn't want to get to be a, a fool professor. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS (laughs) So I actually started thinking about it and I had the, the fortune to have Robert Carter as a graduate student. Ah, Robert was from New York and, you know, those New York people are kinda crazy. (laughs) So I said to him one day, "Well, Robert and I'm getting all these reviews pack saying that I have to study how white people develop an identity. Did it ever occur to you that white people develop an identity?" And he said, "No, it didn't occur to me." And I said, "Didn't occur to me either." (laughs) "So why don't you go out and ask people, white people how they develop their white identity?" And so, Robert went out and started asking people questions about their white identity, and based on their answers, I beg, began to see this as maybe a process that's kind of like, ah, an American citizen going to another country, dis, discovering, ah, their culture if you will, by contrast to someone else. And so that's essentially how white identity theory came about. It's the discovery of one's whiteness, ah, that my theory intends to reflect. 

00:26:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Go on. 

00:26:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS  So the interaction then has to do with the fact that if you have these different types of ways of perceiving yourself and other people, then you also have different ways of interacting with them. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:26:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS And that's essentially what the dyadic process or interaction model is about. 

00:26:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay, good. I sort of skipped ahead a little bit because you've already gone to the interaction model, but you've done quite a bit of work of course on the identity models, the people of color and also the white models. Uhm, what are some of the common misperceptions do you see about, ah, people's interpretation of the models? 

00:26:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, probab, depending on which ones we're talking about, but the one that's common to all of them is that people see the models as reflecting strong stages. So they think of people as being in one stage or another stage. And that's actually never how I wrote the model. It would be like if, ah, Freudian theory said that people had either an id or an ego, but not both. 

00:27:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:27:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS Whereas what I intend is for it to be a fluid process. It's a process that's ongoing. So the person may actually have different aspects of different, of each of the statuses contained within themselves. 

00:27:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

00:27:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS So in a sense, when anyone talks about people is having a dominate status, it just means that that's what defines the range of who they can be. So if you're, if you're, ah, first stat, if you're in the, if you're using the first status primarily, then what that means to me, depending on which theory, but let's say the Black theory, conformity or pre-encounter. If that's the status that you're using, that doesn't mean that we will never see any higher-level racial behaviors. It just say, means that most of the time, the range of your behaviors and attitudes will be in that conformity pre-encounter, ah, perspective. 

00:28:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. You had said before, you corrected me that, ah, people of color model is really a different model then. It doesn't replace the black model. 

00:28:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS  It, it does not replace the Black model. The Black model is strongly focused on the issues of being a Black American in the United States. 

00:28:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:28:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS The people of color model tries to capture those aspects of oppression that, or shared by the people of color including African-Americans in the country. 

00:28:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Okay. 

00:28:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS So uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Who are you defining as people of color? 

00:28:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, Asian Americans, (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS Latino-Latina Americans, uhm, Native Americans, ah, biracial-multiracial Americans, (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:28:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS did I miss any? 

00:28:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) It could be... (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS It could be anyone. (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Anyone. (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS Anyone, anyone who defines him or herself as a person of color. 

00:29:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Okay. 

00:29:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS Or is, is defined by others as a person of color. 

00:29:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Is everybody, is everybody have a race? 

00:29:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS In this society, yeah, because it's a social construction. 

00:29:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:29:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS So even people who think of themselves as having many races actually had a race. 

00:29:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. All right, so they somehow get positioned within the hierarchy? 

00:29:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS It's, ah, they somehow get positioned. (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS Which actually, to bring up another pet topic, is, is not new. People were always positioned in the hierarchy. It's just that now, we have more names for their position. 

00:29:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. People are in, there's an imposition of hierarchy and then people sort of, in trying to make sense of this construction, create their own? 

00:29:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, I don't think people create their own hier, well, people create hierarchies within groups... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...but I think there's a larger systemic hierarchy that, uhm, people attempt to fit into. 

00:30:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS It's the hierarchy that has the power that determines actually how all of us relate ah, with respect to that dynamic. 

00:30:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Ah, the, okay, so the, the upper part, the, the top of the heap (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:30:16
DR. JANET E. HELMS The top of the heap. 

00:30:16
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Uhm, on the international front, I wanted to move just a little bit that before we get back to the US. Uhm, one of the headlines that I had come across, and I told, talked to you about that a little bit, was that in ah, contemporary in Zimbabwe, there is, uhm, uhm, a very big problem with, ah, people with Albu, albinism, who were albino. And, uhm, one of the problems is that they're denied jobs, they're having a difficulty finding jobs and it seems as though they're finding, these are black albinos by the way, ah, finding a place within society. I wanted to get back to that configuration of race because races seems to bring with it, race and racism together, this, this pathology. Uhm, and there's also reports that, uhm, albino women are, uhm, being raped at high numbers and this, this belief that, uhm, if you have sex with an albino woman, that you will be free of AIDS. Uhm, there's, we're now talking about a phenomenon within this already very sinister, uhm, hierarchy where, uhm, there's more confusion, there's more chaos. And you're referring to something that was occurring here that was similar. 

00:31:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Well, in some sense, I think you make my case where it raises social construction, because in some sense the albino women in Zimbabwe or the women of color in the US, in the US. If you think about the albino women as not you as the other, then that gives you the right to subjugate and dominate them in whatever way that you think is appropriate. With women of color, the history has always been that one starts with sexual oppression. And so, in a sense, what we're seeing in Zimbabwe is defining, ah, a race to races, ah, black albino versus non-albino population. Clearly, the black albino women have no power and so their, they have become the victim of the system. Historically, the same has been true of women of color in the United States. Uhm, the incidents of rape and sexual victimization are much greater for our groups, for the women of color groups, than they are for ah, white women in the, in the country or for ah, men of any of the races in the country. So in a sense, uhm, I guess sexual domination or exploitation is the ultimate way of saying that, "I have power over you". It's the ultimate way of feeling, of feeling in control. 

00:33:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I think it's interesting how you segwayed into the intersection of race and gender. Because one of the things that I've heard criticized is that when you study race, you're preoccupied that you're somehow not capable of understanding the extent of human complexity and you're not seeing the other things that intersect with race. 

00:33:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Mwah? 

00:33:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Does that happen to you? 

00:33:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS That I am not able to see the intersection between. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON No, but you get accused of that. 

00:33:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Oh, I get accused of so many things you'll be surprised. 

00:33:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) I attended a conference recently where people were once again diminishing race in saying social class was the issue or the bigger issue. We see that happening a lot too as though both couldn't exist. 

00:33:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Where, there confound it. Uhm, if you look at absolute numbers, there are certainly more poor white people in the country. But people of color, and that's actually all the groups of color, are disproportionately poor people. So in some, in some sense, ah, what happens is that when we're talking about poverty in most circumstances, we're using that as a euphemism for, for, for color. We have a, we have kind of a strange society in many ways. Uhm, although most poor people are white, they're not supposed to be poor. And so when a poor white person is discovered, that means we ought to do something to correct their circumstances. And the things we ought to do are things like make sure that they get into college. I think about the recent Michigan case, for example. (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:34:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS The argument was that middle class, ah, Latino-Latina, and black students should not be admitted over a poor white person because, ah, it's worse to be a poor white person than it is to be a middle class African-American or Latino-Latina person. So they were advocating for college for poor white people. When a poor person of color (coughs) is discovered, we advocate for putting them in jail or some ho, some, in some other kind of way disenfranchising them. So, I think social class just gives us a way to treat people racially without acknowledging that we are treating people racially. 

00:35:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yeah, and social class has been constructed around race... (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Exactly. 

00:35:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON ..from the history of the country. 

00:35:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Exactly. Uhm, that's certainly why, uhm, Africans were important to develop a class structure. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:35:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS You could not have, uhm, people who came to the United States or what became the United States expecting to move upward working in menial jobs, and so you had to have someone who could come in and, and do those jobs. And the native Americans weren't cooperating too well... (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON huh-huh. 

00:36:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...so they, ah, had to essentially find another group that was more visible and could therefore become the people who did that. And in fact, all of the groups who have come in since the first large group had been put in the role of being in the lower socio-economic groups. 

00:36:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes, so there's a pattern there? 

00:36:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS So there's a pattern. 

00:36:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON There's a pattern. We see that. Why do you think races stayed with us for so long? Why is it so persistent stubbornly so? 

00:36:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Because it's so useful. Uhm, if you can make decisions on the basis of race and what you think race represents then it saves you a whole lot of psychological energy, it saves you a whole lot of economic, ah, cost. Uhm, it works. Not only that, but if you were to get rid of race, then you would have to get rid of privilege in society. And who would want to give up privilege if they have it? In some sense, if you have race, we all know what our roles are in the society, and so, uhm, it's in a way comfortable. 

00:37:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. It keeps us, well, we, we keep it here but we also don't wanna look at it for those reasons to framed. 

00:37:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, we may, may. See, our role in the system is to fight against it but as long as we're fighting against it, then we're not doing other kinds of things. 

00:37:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Like? 

00:37:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Like, ah, enjoying privilege. 

00:37:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh-huh. (laughs) I see. It's a lot of psychic energy that's being expended. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS Exactly. 

00:37:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  I see. Uhm, I wanted to go back to the racial interaction model because I think it happens to be, uhm, a very, uhm, important, pivotal contribution. It seems to give us a way out, it gives us a tool, the tools to work through some of these issues dialectically. Uhm, can you explain, ah, the model a little bit? I think that one, I think that the racial interaction model can be often misunderstood as well. 

00:38:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, I don't quite know what you want so stop me if I ... (crosstalk) 

00:38:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. 

00:38:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...go somewhere you don't. 

00:38:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON All right. 

00:38:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, essentially, what the racial identity model is, is talking about how our (coughs) different ways of conceptualizing issues of race and power influence how we interact with each other. So I talk about, ah, parallel relationships as being situations in which, situations or events in which, ah, the people participating see, ah, racial dynamics, power dynamics and similar kinds of ways. I talked about, ah, regressive kinds of relationships as being relationships in which pe, people or systems having, ah, more power or trying to force people to see the world in the way that they see them, see the world, and, ah, progressive relationships or events as being situations where people with more power ah, are able to form collaborative kinds of interactions with people with less power around issues of race and power. So, ah, racial interaction theory is actually a theory about individual level, ah, conversations between, ah, people. 

00:39:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS It's also a model that talks about the dynamics between groups of individuals. Ah, it's also a theory that talks about the interactions among systems, if you will. 

00:39:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Right. And it was, the entire model was what I witnessed. Which in the progressive model, the progressive interaction is the one that is to, toward leading toward good change or progressive change. 

00:40:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ex, exactly. Progressive is when both parties are able to see the need for change and then to collaborate in the process of moving the change. 

00:40:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON You also pointed out that this is, this can be in a dyadic situation like counseling in therapy? 

00:40:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS It could be in a dyadic situation like a counseling in therapy and I should, should also say that it's, it too is dynamic. It's not as though one gets into a progressive relationship and is progressive all the time. 

00:40:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:40:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS What can happen is that you get into a relationship and if you work towards it, maybe it moves towards progression and maybe you have a fight and it moves somewhere else. So, ah, again, the type of relationship or event means that it's, that's the range, it can, it can be there but it's not necessarily fixed at that, at that place. 

00:40:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. What seems to drive, ah, the, the person who has influence, who can lead this relationship, ah, what drives it is that person's advanced schemata or schema? 

00:41:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah, yeah. 

00:41:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) We were talking about the differences between the both of them. I wanted to read a passage to you from, uhm, Bishop Desmond Tutu and, uhm, it's from a book called "No (coughs) Future Without Forgiveness." And he's describing a word called Ubuntu. Uhm, and I just wanted to read, to read it for a second and then I'll come back and, and you'll see the relevance of this in just a second. Uhm, first of all, it says that the term is difficult to translate into the Western language but it generally means the very essence of being human. And further, Bishop Tutu says, "It is to say, my humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up in yours. We belong in a bundle of life. A person with Ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does not feel threatened that others are able and good for he or she has a proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others are tortured or oppressed or treated as if they were less than who they are." Uhm, end quote. I'm struck by that description because it sounds like the final status of the models. 

00:42:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Well, it sounds like the final status to me too except that I would say the description sounds like, again, that it's fixed and I would say... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...that that's a process that's what we're aiming for. Uhm, my guess is that few of us reach it but... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:42:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...as, as a fixed status but we're always aiming for that. That's our process, that's our ideal, that's, that's where we're trying to be. 

00:42:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. It's the striving that we're, we're headed for. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS It's, it's, it's the striving. 

00:43:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. That's very good point. Uhm, the other thing that strikes me about that description is that, uhm, in that description, there's no mention of race. Uhm, what he's talking about now is something that seems to go beyond race, and that seems to be consistent as well that we're striving for something that is gonna tackle or battle all oppression. 

00:43:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I, I think that that's what I would see as what we're striving for except that I think we strive for it without giving up race in an odd sort of way. Because if the only way we can get there is to pretend that race doesn't exist in, in our society and doesn't affect who we are, then we're essentially in denial. And denial has not worked very well for, I would argue anyone, but particularly for people of color. So I would say, what we're trying to do is to get to this transcendent place by integrating the various aspects of ourselves. So we want to acknowledge that race is, as however it's defined is a part of who we are. Gender is, sexual orientation is, all of these things are a part of who we are. All of them in some kind of way have oppression associated with them, and so the task is to recognize the specific elements and then work towards overcoming those elements, in, in, in my perspectives. 

00:44:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Specificity is, is the key here that we may try to aspire to these things but if we're not looking specifically at the, the, the evils, looking at the kinds of, the ways in which they manifest, then we might, we not might get there very, vey well. 

00:44:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS Yeah. I would, I would agree with that. Uhm, it's very easy to focus on one of them and think that we have reached the higher level all the time. 

00:45:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:45:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS  But at the same time, we're doing things that are oppressive in some of the other aspects... (crosstalk) 

00:45:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:45:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS ..of ourselves. And so, I would say that transcendence is, ah, is being aware of the process of working on all of those dimensions of oneself. 

00:45:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Another, in the, ah, the piece psychology literature, which I'm being, I'm increasingly familiar with, there's a lot of research surrounding social identity theory. Are you familiar with the social identity theory? 

00:45:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS As in the Tajfel... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

00:45:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...kinds of theories? Yeah. 

00:45:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Right. Uhm, it would seem that to offer a contrast that racial identity theory gives us something specific to hold on to, to look at, uhm, something specific where a social identity theory almost seems to imply that everything is sort of on an equal level that we can sort of generally talk about so, our identification with some group, and that's sufficient for us to know and learn about. 

00:46:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS I agree with you. That's one of my difficulties with the social identity theories. It's that they don't seem to recognize that groups or identity issues have different ah, levels of power in the societies. And so, the same kinds of processes, ah, define a powerful group process. A powerful assimilation process cannot be the same kinds of identity issues that define less powerful, ah, group identification or process. 

00:46:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. And not necessarily with that particular theory but it, it could seem like that might be an avoidance by looking almost universally across the different, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS  You mean, like in multicultural theory? 

00:46:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Okay. Let's talk about multicultural theory (laughs). We couldn't avoid that one. 

00:46:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS No. We couldn't avoid that one. 

00:46:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON We couldn't avoid that. And you've written before that you believe that multicultural, multiculturalism is, been a useful term to describe the kinds of, the topics that become addressed, the many, the many topics we addressed, but it becomes, I believe your words are "virtually useless as a scientific construct." 

00:47:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS Did I say that? 

00:47:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes, you did. (laugh) Please expound. (laugh) 

00:47:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, I, I think it's an ambiguous term and so it often stops conversation... (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  All right. 

00:47:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...particularly when the conversation around a particular identity issue is getting ah, stressful, then we often hear people result to multiculturalism. Uhm, multiculturalism actually grew out of people not wanting to talk about race. 

00:47:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:47:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS So if you talk about everything, then you don't have to talk about anything. I would have no trouble with multiculturalism if people said, today we're talking about multiculturalism, meaning race and that's what you talked about, or today we're talking about multiculturalism, meaning sexual orientation and that's what you talked about. (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON All right. 

00:48:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS But what often happens is that you have a conversation that's a multicultural conversation and someone's talking about race, someone's talking about sexual orientation and nothing, nothing gets resolved because the conversation isn't really happening at a, at a complex level. 

00:48:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Plus I've noticed there's even some sloppiness to the use of the term like I've seen review, I've reviewed articles where people are saying, uhm, I have a multicultural client or, ah, and it means (laughs) virtually nothing. We use, we, we get very sloppy with our language that way. 

00:48:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS It indeed, and that's, that's why I don't really think it's scientific. I don't think it's very ah, practitioner oriented. Uhm, in many ways, it's useful for defining a, a broad domain, but after that, we, it needs, it needs work. 

00:48:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON It needs work, okay. Racial identity theory, the word identity stands out and when we (inaudible ), we think about perhaps psychological theory like Erickson. And there's, it sort of conjures up these ideas of, ah, of a bounded self, of how one identifies. Uhm, it almost sort of conjures up this idea of an a contextual reality. But you've been persistent in talking about racial identity development as an interaction between people and environments. Uhm, I have a quote from you. 

00:49:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I, I have to stop writing stuff down. (laughs) 

00:49:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  This was written in 1995 and you talked about in this passage, uhm, this whole idea of, of how change occurs in racial identity. And, uhm, I think we can often get this idea that, uhm, you can do some things to, you know, facilitate it or somebody can do some things to facilitate it. But, uhm, there really needs to be a lot more going on. This is what, this is the quote. "In a sense, maturation," and that's referring to maturation of racial identity," is triggered by need. That is, as the person encounters personally meaningful racial material in his or her environments and. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS Environments, but also the environmental climate more generally. So, so, uhm, there's always this interplay between who am I as a racial person and who is the society as a racial system. (crosstalk) 

00:50:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:50:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  And I try to, I try to incorporate that into my theory. Now, what that means is that, as, as society changes how it conceptualizes race, how it treats people as a result of race. That also changes the kinds of identities that are available for... (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:50:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...people to environments, but also the environmental climate more generally. So, so, uhm, there's always this interplay between who am I as a racial person and who is the society as a racial system. (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:51:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS And I try to, I try to incorporate that into my theory. Now, what that means is that, ah, society changes how it conceptualizes race, how it treats people as a result of race. That also changes the kinds of identities that are available for... (crosstalk) 

00:51:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

00:51:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...people to incorporate it into themselves. 

00:51:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I see. 

00:51:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS If, uhm, society, for example, were one day to wake up and say, not only are all people equal but I think of all people as my brothers and sisters. Uhm, let's all go out and do each other's cultures together. Ah, let's, ah, make sure that no one is suffering regardless of their race ethnicity. Then we really wouldn't need this developmental process because in a sense, everyone would be born into a society where there was, ah, internalization or, ah, whatever I call it depending of which theory we're, we're talking about. 

00:51:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

00:51:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS So, the theory changes according to what's available in our society for us to integrate into ourselves. 

00:52:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON That's, are you optimistic about, uhm, (laughs) the ability for change to occur and contemporary society, the, and on, ah, pervasive scale, shall I say? 

00:52:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I, I have to be op-, optimistic. I wrote a theory about white people in which I say they can advance (laughs). Uhm, am I optimistic? It changes depending on who's in the white House, (laughs) so to speak. Uhm, I have to believe that people can evolve to better places because I have seen people evolved to better places. The question is whether or not those people who are doing that, who are in the process of doing that can also recognize what I think of as our responsibility to change the society... (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...so that it, too, can evolve to better places. But I think it's possible, uhm, I think it's possible. 

00:53:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. At, even culture theory, psychological and ecological, because it would, it seemed important that we attend as much to environment as we do to people, context for, for building change. 

00:53:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I think it's psychological. I would agree that it's ecological. I also think it's political. 

00:53:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, I don't think it would be useful if we spent our time just thinking about this as a scientific theory that we can use to understand how events happen and as we take the next step in the evolutionary process which is to go out and change the world in some way. 

00:53:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. Much broader more or less on some things. 

00:53:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS Yeah. 

00:53:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  I wanted to discuss with you, uhm, a new legislation called "No Child Left Behind." (coughs) (laughs) You, uhm, I know, have a very big interest in investment in education. Indeed, uhm, there are many people, I think in the education, I know, from the education literature, particularly education on anthropology, who seemed to be examining issues of race and if in(ph), and identity and ethnicity and culture and all those things as in constructions of schools and so forth and so on. So I think there's a big impact of the theory in terms of education. Uhm, I'll just give you the, the stimulus, ah, perspectives on "No Child Left Behind" legislation. 

00:54:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, I think the no child left behind legislation came about in an interesting time in US society. We had just about reached the level at which children of color were graduating from high school at the same rate as white children. So they weren't behind. They were essentially caught up. And then, this legislation came out in which students were required to obtain certain scores on states, on test, high stakes test, and now virtually every state in the, in the country. And so we get these rates now where children of color or(ph), are essentially being encouraged to drop out of systems, ah, before they graduate from high school because they will not get high enough test scores. Now, we know without giving them these tests that they will not get high enough test scores because historically, ah, black and Latino-Latina children have not obtained the same test scores as white children. We know this so well that we can, we can just about estimate what their test score will be if we know what the white children's test score will be. So in some sense, we don't even need to punish the children by making them take these tests. What we could do is just test the white children and get the children of color random... (crosstalk) 

00:56:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...score somewhere around (laughs) a standard deviation below the main of, of white students. And, that's, that's been historically true since testing has existed. Now, if people who really identified children of color as their children, if they really believed that all children are our children, they would know that there's something wrong with the system that bel, really believes that white children are, are that much smarter than children of color. (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS  But the test essentially reinforce what people believe about children of color, which is that they aren't intellectually, ah, ah, efficient, aren't intellectually skilled. And so, we're willing to let them drop out of the system, ah, because they're afraid of these tests. It's not that these children are not bright. They, many of them are doing very well academically. Uhm, many of them thought that they were going to graduate because they got great GPA's until they learn that they had to get a particular score on a test in order to determine whether or not they could graduate. So they dropped out. They also dropped out because the schools know that if there're students don't get a particular test score, then government resources... (crosstalk) 

00:57:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right, yeah. 

00:57:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...will be taken away from them. What did they do? They encouraged the students to drop out so that they will not lose resources. 

00:57:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Ahh. 

00:57:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  What that then means is that in the newspapers, you see things like our, our test scores have jumped from where they were previously. (crosstalk) 

00:57:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Oh, I see. 

00:57:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, they jump because they've kicked out all of these students of color. Ah, one of my colleagues is doing research in which he traces what happens to, ah, Black males who dropped out before taking, ah, this state test in New York. And what he finds is that, that within five years, those boys are in the juvenile justice system, (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm, yeah(ph). 

00:58:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS so they're in prison. We know that what we're doing is forcing them out onto the streets. What does a child if they don't have a high school diploma in this society? They don't have options. So, I think "No Child Left Behind" as is conceptualized now is actually intended to make sure that there are some children left behind. And we, ah, I know who those children are. They're children of color. 

00:58:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yeah, that's, that's one perspective I haven't read about. I've heard several, uhm, because there's a lot of language about accountability and schools taking responsibility and so forth. And what you're talking about is some of the culture of different schools on what they do to cope with new demands. 

00:58:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS Well, what they do to cope with unrealistic demands. 

00:58:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yeah. 

00:58:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, tests were never meant to be instruments that were used to force people out of systems. Tests were never actually meant to be a replacement for grades. So you often hear people say that, ah, the test will give them objective evidence and control over grade inflation and so forth. Well, there's no evidence that children of color ever benefited from grade inflation. (laughs) And so, who, what kind of objective evidence is it that the test scores are provided? (crosstalk) 

00:59:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

00:59:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS  I, I think it's not objective at all. 

00:59:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. You've also mentioned, I believe it was in an interview with, uhm, Robert Carter that, uhm, one of the concerns you have to is that what the emphasis on test, children are just being taught how to perform well on test more than anything else. 

00:59:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Children are being taught how to perform well on test. It's clearly a system that benefits people who have money and people who don't have money. People who have money don't have to take the test. They go to private schools and the private schools don't have to give them those tests. So it's really the children who are stuck in these state systems who have to take test and, ah, perform on a particular level. What this means then is that often if you go into classrooms, they're doing road practicing of the test. That means that we're losing all of the creative language that these children bring to the classroom. This means that we're losing all of the ideas that these children potentially bring to a classroom. We're teaching them essentially that school is boring, that learning is boring, that this is what they will have to do if they decide to continue in academia. I think that if I have gone to school and every day, what we did was practice multiple-choice questions, I probably would have dropped out too. (crosstalk) 

01:00:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

01:00:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah, to me that seems to be the most, the cruelest thing you could probably do to a child... (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Sure. 

01:00:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...uhm, in the educational system. 

01:00:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON And we do have to take into account the private school systems, and we know that many private schools can start as a result of, uhm, you know, transitions with the neighborhoods, uhm, white flight is very familiar idea on how life schools are started and so forth, and that has to be looked at in, in just a position with this idea of what goes on in public schools. 

01:01:05
DR. JANET E. HELMS I think so. 

01:01:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yeah. You're kinda veering into another topic of high stakes testing which is something I know that you have recently put a lot of attention in. What, what have you been doing exactly lately with the high stakes testing? 

01:01:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah, writing manuscripts and trying to get them published (laughs)? 

01:01:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. And... (crosstalk) 

01:01:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON ...some difficulties? 

01:01:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah, quite a few difficulties, actually, since you brought it up (laughs). Uhm, the issue is that all of testing essentially has been centered around the notion of comparing racial groups. Uhm, and racial groups are defined as essentially on the basis of physical characteristics, either who the test, who the students think they are or who the researcher thinks they are in terms of racial characteristics. So to me, that's a biological definition of race. 

01:01:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

01:01:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS And if you only test biological definitions, then, in fact, what you will get is a biological answer. So we have about a hundred and ten years or so of testing research in which we know very clearly that White people will score the highest on test, and we, we know by about how much they will score the highest on, on test. We know how much the various groups of color will score, and then we have, most, most of them we know will score lower. We think Asians will score higher but, of course, we camouflage that a little because what really happens is that, uhm, Asians score higher on Math and lower on verbal. They score just enough higher on Math to make them equal to whites and, ah, with, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:02:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (inaudible ) 

01:02:52
DR. JANET E. HELMS within measure, within measurement era. (crosstalk) 

01:02:52
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I see. 

01:02:52
DR. JANET E. HELMS  And it also depends on which Asian... (crosstalk) 

01:02:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (inaudible ) 

01:02:57
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...ethnic group we're looking at. So, but, ah, that scoring pattern is sufficient enough for people to say, well, if Asians score, they always say higher without mentioning that it's really not higher, it's even. If Asians score higher, then that must mean that these other groups could do it too. Well, that takes attention away from the notion that there is something wrong with this testing process if in a hundred and ten years, there's never been a published case in which on average, either black or Latino-Latinas, ah, test takers did better than white test takers. Imagine that, not in, not in a school system, (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

01:03:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS not in professional schools, (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:03:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS not in jobs, not, ah, not in the government, nowhere is there a study where an average black test takers have done better than white test takers in the same setting. Latino-Latina test takers have done better than white test takers in the same setting. So, that would suggest to me the dice are kinda loaded. 

01:03:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

01:03:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, but it doesn't seem to suggest that to the professional testing community. 

01:04:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

01:04:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Now, I can understand why it wouldn't because it means that they'd have to change something that they're doing. So, uhm, my research, actually, is looking at racial identity and how that is related to people's performance on high stakes test. And what you'll find is that we can actually account for the difference in performance with race, with racial identity. This seems to upset traditional testing people a whole lot. 

01:04:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I've read (laughs). 

01:04:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  And, ah, well, you probably, you probably read the article in which they accused me of, of doing a study that was against the law. 

01:04:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) They accused you of many things in that article. 

01:04:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS (laughs) Yeah, but that was the nicest one. 

01:04:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Okay. 

01:04:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS So, pretty much, ah, that was a visible example of the kinds of reactions I'm getting to this work. Uhm, the invisible reactions are that, ah, reviewers refuse to read my manuscripts. Uhm, they claim that, ah, that is not possible, that anything other than racial categories could account for the difference. They strongly believe that, I, I have a new title. Did I tell you my new title? 

01:05:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON No. 

01:05:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, I'm called the radical egalitarian. 

01:05:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Oh, (laughs) the radical egalitarian. 

01:05:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS  The radical egalitarian and apparently... (crosstalk) 

01:05:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON That's not a queen test (laughs). 

01:05:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS (laughs) well, I might get that one soon. 

01:05:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay (laughs). 

01:05:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS And the explanation for why I'm the rega, the radical egalitarian is because I'm accused of believing that intelligence is distributed equally within racial groups. (crosstalk) 

01:05:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Oh. 

01:05:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS So that any, ah, racial group could be as intelligent as the white racial group. Uhm, "This is simply not true," the reviewers say. You just, all you have to do is look at the literature, and this is, this is just a radical egalitarian trying to stir up trouble. (crosstalk) 

01:05:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Oh. 

01:05:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS  So in, in essence, people are not happy with me with respect to, ah, this new line of research. It might mean that you won't see anything published for a while. 

01:06:05
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Okay. All right. All right. 

01:06:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS But know that I'm taking this one to the Math. 

01:06:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. I, I was thinking of the word "queen" because I was, it sounds like something that Lanning Cunier(ph) was accused of some time ago without being radically, something like that, ah, combination of words, but she eventually, it got sized down to coda(ph) queen, uhm, if you recall. So... 

01:06:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS And so, you mean, I could be the coda(ph) queen too, soon? 

01:06:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON You could be it too. Yes, (laughs) this is what you could aspire. 

01:06:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS Wow. 

01:06:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Right. I wanted to make sure that we have some time to talk again about you. Uhm, when we, uhm, people who study race and, specifically try to tease out race from its ethnicity, not to eliminate ethnicity, of course, but to hone in on some of the moral challenges that come with race. Uhm, there're a lot of unpleasant experiences that come with that. And some of the experiences that, what you've mentioned before, not being, ah, acknowledged, not getting published, uhm, and in a personal situations or in groups, you can even be attacked, uhm, diminished. How do you cope with this? 

01:07:25
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Uhm, it depends on my mood. One of the things, though, that I found useful is racial identity theory. Uhm, there was a time when being attacked might debilit, debilitate... (crosstalk) 

01:07:45
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:07:45
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...me because I had no sense of what was happening. But now, I can take a few minutes to say, well, this person is using whatever schema they seemed to be using at the time. What kind of intervention do I want to make here? Because I also have a systems theory, then I can also take a, a look at where I am and see whether or not it's safe for me to make the kind of intervention that I, I need to make in that, in that given situation. 

01:08:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Because of some consequences. 

01:08:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS Because of some consequences. Uhm, if it's not, then because I have a theory, then I'm able to begin to think about some alternative places or ways that I might intervene to make my situation better without necessarily getting myself killed, ah, literally or figuratively. 

01:08:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

01:08:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  So, I cope with it a lot by, uhm, often, I'm in situations by myself. So that's mostly when I would cope with it in those ways. I also cope with it by forming coalitions when I can with like-minded people, and sometimes we're able to cope with it together. Uhm, sometimes, I cope with it by going home and having a major temper tantrum. (crosstalk) 

01:09:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

01:09:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS How could they be so stupid? (laughs) Uhm, so I guess I have a variety of ways of coping depending on, on what the circumstances are. Sometimes, I call up a friend and say, "This happened to me." (laughs) And, ah, chances are something similar has happened to them and so we have a catharsis hour and figure out things we could do like write books about the stupidest things that have ever been said to us about race or something like that. (laughs) 

01:09:25
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  Is a book coming out like that? 

01:09:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS We're still thinking about it. 

01:09:30
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON (laughs) Okay. All right. Uhm, Bell Hooks once said that, uhm, Black woman in particular, but I would assume that she means women in, of color in general, uhm, can be assailed from all sides. And that's from men of color and, you know, uhm, just, all those kinds of things. So it can be, uhm, pretty lonely place. 

01:09:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS It can be a pretty lonely place. 

01:10:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:10:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS Uhm, particularly, if you have my, my philosophy of oppression or fighting oppression, which is I try not to compete with people who are on, on sim, similar wrongs of the oppression scale, (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Hmm. 

01:10:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS and many people don't know that. And so it's, it's often easy for people to come in with the idea or the expectation that I'm going to compete with them over a slice of pie when in fact, I'm probably not if they tell me that they want the pie. 

01:10:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:10:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS So, it's often lonely because people come in with a particular expectation of who I am and who they are and how they ought to interact without checking out what, whether that perception is valid. 

01:10:50
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Because they're expecting competition. 

01:10:50
DR. JANET E. HELMS They're expecting competition because society socializes us to be competitive. 

01:10:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:10:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS  A wonderful example, uhm, one of the big fights that I think people are trying to instigate is between, uhm, me and Bill Cross over whose theory or whose measure is the best. Uhm, it occurs to me why does there only have to be one theory. Why can't there be many theories of how things happen? 

01:11:20
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Right. 

01:11:20
DR. JANET E. HELMS And bec, if people were begin, were to think about that, there are, there are, I think, one thinks about all of the theories that are available for white people, the counseling theories, there are multitude of those. No one says you've gotta have, ah, ob, objects relations theory and that's got to be the only one. (crosstalk) 

01:11:40
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. 

01:11:40
DR. JANET E. HELMS Why does there only have to be one racial identity theory? So my notion is, the more the better. Uhm, if mine doesn't work, take Bill's. Of course, I think mine works better. But (laughs) if mine doesn't work, take, take, take Bill's or, ah... (crosstalk) 

01:11:55
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON I will. 

01:11:55
DR. JANET E. HELMS ...I saw him sitting over there. (laughs) Or, or who, whoever has one, ah, if they think it works better, that's, that's fine with me. The idea is not to have the best theory but to find something that allows us to change the dynamic of, of the society around the issues of race. 

01:12:10
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON And that's the most important thing. 

01:12:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS That's the most important thing. So, the, for me, the more the better. 

01:12:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Yes. You found that the institute, and in the words you have, the study and promotion of race and culture, promoting race? Why are we promoting something so evil? 

01:12:30
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Ah, well, because, just because we have thought about it as evil does not mean that there are no positive aspects of it. If you were here for Margaret Bill Spencer's talk today, one of the things she talked about was the positive aspects of, of race, the, ah, coping skills that people learn as a result of who they are racially. 

01:13:00
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Uh hmm. 

01:13:00
DR. JANET E. HELMS Ah, if we were to look at the things that we value in our culture, the, the music, the art and so forth, that all comes from the racial socialization experiences that we have had in the society. So what I want us to begin to do is to not just look at the negative aspects of those, of that socialization, but also to begin to think about what strengths, what, ah, ah, skills, what talents we bring to the, the larger whole as a result of our racial socialization experiences. So we eliminate the, the negative and enhance the positive. 

01:13:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Okay. We can do both. 

01:13:35
DR. JANET E. HELMS We can do both. 

01:13:35
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON  I'm gonna to conclude because I know we're getting near the end. (laughs) And I wanna thank you for the interview. I wanna let you know personally that your, your theory has inspired me, uhm, and the forebears of the theories, not just to you, but Dr. Cross as well. And, uhm, I think that as I came across the quote from Bishop Tutu, would reminded me of, of you in your mission and the things that you try to aspire. So, uhm, I appreciate that and I hope that I'm speaking to you about that on behalf of many people. 

01:14:10
DR. JANET E. HELMS Thank you. I appreciate it. As you know, I'm always appreciative and flattered by your high regard. 

01:14:15
DR. CHALMER THOMPSON Thank you. 

01:14:15
DR. JANET E. HELMS  Thanks. 

01:14:20
