TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents LEARNING & TEACHING THERAPY with JAY HALEY a film series by JAY HALEY and MADELEINE RICHEPORT-HALEY 

00:00:35
JAY HALEY This is one of the series of training films on learning and teaching therapy. It is unique perhaps and that the clients are not shown nor are they heard. This is for reasons of confidentiality and the protection of privacy. What is presided is the planning and carrying out of therapy by a supervisor and a training group. It shows a supervisor at work and the trainees expanding their ideas and skills hopefully. The goal is to change therapists as well as to change clients since they must learn on how to change people in distress. The films offer valuable material for discussions since ideas differ about how to do therapy and how to train. The therapy being taught is brief and problem-focused and the trainees have not been taught the particular approach. The supervision is live with the trainees watching from behind a one-way mirror and taking turns going in to do therapy. Suggestions from the supervisor to the therapist are sent to a computer monitor in the therapy room. The therapist can see the messages said on the monitor, but the clients cannot. 

00:01:50
A Positive Approach with A Psychotic Couple 

00:01:55
JAY HALEY There are traditional ways to stabilize people to find they're schizophrenic. This usually involves the use of medication and hospitalization when necessary. More rarely used is an active directive therapy with the goal of maximizing the normality with the person who suffers with that diagnosis. This film illustrates the differences in the approaches by presenting the supervision of a therapist who’s dealing with a couple. The husband is diagnosed as schizophrenia and the wife is schizoaffective disorder. Each is considered incurable and living on total disability. The husband has been unemployed for eight years. Both the husband and wife are hospitalized regularly, each averaging from two to four times a month. When either is upset they call upon a psychiatrist who increases their medication and hospitalizes them. The wife's last hospitalization was when she threatened suicide in the presence of her husband. The husband also has Tardive Dyskinesia, but he continues to be put on antipsychotic medication. The therapist brought the couple into a therapy practicum to see what might be done with them. Previously he had seen them individually for a period and given them up. This was the first time he saw them as a couple. One task of the supervisor was to persuade the therapist to believe that normality could be expected from therapy with the couple. To believe they're incurable and do therapy to change them is a double-bind. This film does not present a completed successful therapy, it offers a way to make a fresh start with the therapy approach in a situation of chronicity.

Planning the Interview 

00:03:40
He has had a diagnosis of schizophrenia since, truly in his mid-20s. I think that’s when (inaudible ). He always had symptoms and some sickness before that ah… that he is formally diagnosed I think at the age of 25 or 26 when he had diagnosis of schizophrenia. She also has a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and… ah… (inaudible ) and problems with her voices and the way she interprets things. She really misinterprets a lot of information. So as a couple they… they try to understand each other, but the problem is when his symptoms start acting up and her symptoms start acting up, their relationship doesn’t seem to work. Ah… I saw them in therapy. 

00:04:30
JAY HALEY What… What are the symptoms? 

00:04:30
Ah… See auditory hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and ah… He has somewhat of an obsessiveness about it. He's really particular about things. He is very, very cautious about things. He really wants some things really planned in. The reasons of him being here at 3:30 or 4:00 was for that reason. He didn’t want to be late. He was really concerned about it. 

00:04:55
JAY HALEY What does he do for a living? 

00:04:55
Ah… They're both ah… disabled. They both have Medicare and Medicaid. They both are collecting SSI and SSA moneys as a couple. Ah… He used to be in computers. 

00:05:10
JAY HALEY What you’re feeling with them in that? 

00:05:10
I… I… I think cleverly they… they do have that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and truly they're disabled ah… that either one can really hold down a full time job. And that they… The medication seemed to work well for a while that it’s not that (inaudible ). I think he’s taking… I think… I think he's on the Risperdal, which is an antipsychotic medication. And… I think he’s taken like a mood stabilizer something like Depakote, I believe, I believe. And she also is on an antidepressant, I'm not sure which one now. And ah… I see… I see… …on a regular basis. Regular meaning once or twice a week, and then she comes in for the therapy and counseling. Most of his problems have to do with their relationship. He’s been hospitalized numerous times and ah… been hospitalized all over the place. He has been hospitalized four times in the last three weeks, no four weeks. And the reason is it’s because he's having more and more fights, problems with his wife. Now, I saw them when they were just married, actually right before they got married and then they got married they lived together for a number of months and then they got married. 

00:06:30
JAY HALEY Well, how long was that? 

00:06:30
Around ah… three to four months. 

00:06:35
JAY HALEY Does either one of them have an individual therapist? 

00:06:40
No, no! 

00:06:40
JAY HALEY So you're at… 

00:06:40
I'm at… And he's also attending a day program, a partial hospital program, which I work at. 

00:06:45
JAY HALEY Okay! And what would you like to get out of this interview? 

00:06:50
I’d like to set up a ah… specific goals for therapy. I’d like to set up a length of time kind of family sessions to be able to work with. I want to have some kind of a finish here. I’m thinking about five or six, just to kind of look at some particular issues and then decide if we need to go on. But he’s very distant from his parents. He got nothing to do with his parents. It was like cut off from there. 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY How old is he? 

00:07:20
30… 38! Yeah! And she is 26. 

00:07:30
JAY HALEY And his parents, does he associate with them at all? 

00:07:35
Maybe a phone call, and that’s it. He doesn’t want anything to do with them. As I recall, they were running his life and controlling his life and treated him like a kid. 

00:07:50
JAY HALEY You want to set some goals to establish? 

00:07:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:07:55
JAY HALEY What do you think is preventing them from being normal? 

00:08:00
I believe that there is a biological component to their schizophrenia. I think that there is, that they do hear, they’re easily distracted and at times ah… disoriented with that. Ah… What keeps them from… from being normal as a couple, you mean? Normal is such a hard word. 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY You are going to make them normal, presumably, if you care! 

00:08:25
Say that again? 

00:08:30
JAY HALEY That’s the problem. You’re thinking of them as incurable and not doing therapy with them. 

00:08:35
I’m not saying they’re incurable. You know, I think there are some limitations to what they can do. I believe that. 

00:08:40
JAY HALEY That’s true with all of us. 

00:08:40
Yeah! And as far as them getting in a relationship, I think that’s possible. They can learn how to communicate and how to involve each other and how to… how to work with each other well. 

00:08:55
JAY HALEY Why don’t they go to work? 

00:09:00
He says he gets overwhelmed. He says that he gets overwhelmed with ah… putting in the day, having to be there, having people telling him what to do. 

00:09:10
JAY HALEY An authority problem. 

00:09:10
Hmm… Right! 

00:09:15
JAY HALEY It's just that he’s paid to be abnormal at the moment. And I don’t know how you feel about that. 

00:09:25
I think that’s true. I think that we do compensate for some behaviors in our society, and that’s true. And he’s getting paid to… to act out. That’s a viable possibility. 

00:09:40
JAY HALEY Do they have to keep getting that renewed? 

00:09:45
That will probably… They’re on permanent disability, it’s my understanding, and it doesn’t… doesn’t really end up ah… changing. There's not a lot of change in that. People don’t get better in other words under that system. Medicare and SSA - it’s like being retired. 

00:10:00
But they do review it. (Inaudible ), say review it every three or four years, make them hard. 

00:10:10
He's become ah… He’s become suicidal. He does make lot of threats. And ah… He doesn’t do anything violent. He doesn’t, you know, act out or anything like that. He’ll call his doctor and say, “you know, I just can’t handle this. I am having problems.” And the doctor will arrange a hospitalization. 

00:10:30
JAY HALEY Suppose you decided there was nothing wrong with these two, how would you have a session tonight? 

00:10:40
I think I’d do the same thing. Try to reestablish the goals and reestablish the some… some, perhaps little boundaries with each other. 

00:10:45
JAY HALEY And you’d assume they’re capable of that? 

00:10:50
I believe they are capable of doing that. 

00:10:50
JAY HALEY They’re not interested in having children together? 

00:10:55
He has one son from a previous marriage and has some contact with him. But no, they are not… They don’t want children. He doesn’t want any more children. 

00:11:05
JAY HALEY She doesn’t want? How seriously did they take their own state of mind as an illness? 

00:11:15
I think they’re very invested in their illness. 

00:11:20
JAY HALEY Well, I think you have the… the proper view of them. It will just be interesting if you’d shift your view of them. 

00:11:25
How so? 

00:11:30
JAY HALEY Well, if you started off by saying to the guy, I’d like to set a date for you to go to work. And that should be our goal here and your wife can help with that. And it could be a month from now; it could be a year from now. Just so we know that you are going to be normal and work like other people. 

00:11:50
Paid position working? 

00:11:50
JAY HALEY Um? 

00:11:50
Wow! 

00:11:55
Does on-care qualify? 

00:11:55
JAY HALEY What? 

00:11:55
Does on-care work qualify? 

00:11:55
Yeah! 

00:12:00
JAY HALEY Any kind of work. And he’s qualified to do something. That leads you into what he is qualified for and what is his attitude about a boss. But you’re treating him like this is some deviant thing that he accidentally got into, instead of this is a career, which is, his illness career. It’s a very tough case to have a mental illness career and the assumption of biological problem. Because what you tend to do, everybody just tries to something stable. Like there’s not trouble or he’s not going into the hospital this week. 

00:12:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:40
JAY HALEY And she’s not upsetting him or he’s not upsetting her. It isn’t that they’re gonna recover in five years from now. Each have an interesting career or something like that. If they’re not having kids, they’ve got to have something else. They must just spend all their time together? 

00:12:55
Yes they do. In fact, they are very dependent on one another. Yeah, they’re together, 24 hours a day just about. 

00:13:05
JAY HALEY They are locked in some mutual protective system. 

00:13:05
I think they are. 

00:13:10
JAY HALEY Or they provoke each other to stabilize each other. But anyhow, it would just be interesting to treat them like they are normal and see how they react. 

00:13:20
Her county mental health and she did a really good job. Ah… She kept it, you know, so, I mean, she's already done that. 

00:13:30
I don’t think each one is capable of holding down a full-time, four-day-a-week job for days and days and days. I don’t think they’ll be able to do that. But I think they can do like part-time or consulting. 

00:13:40
Short-term! 

00:13:40
Some short-term or a couple hours here and there. Yeah, I think that is possible. 

00:13:45
JAY HALEY I think they will drive each other nuts living together and neither one of them working. 

00:13:45
I think they do drive each other nuts. 

00:13:50
So I wonder what happened that they got together and they got really decompensated or you know did this relationship drive them into permanent disability or? 

00:14:05
And she's always suicidal. She calls hotlines constantly. 

00:14:05
Yes. 

00:14:05
“I'm feeling suicidal, I don’t…” Hmm…Hmm… Uses a lot. 

00:14:10
Yeah. 

00:14:10
But she attend in ROP classes. She did a lot actually. She got her own car. I don’t know if she’s (inaudible ). 

00:14:21
Yeah! Well he has a car. 

00:14:21
JAY HALEY That show that when schizophrenics get older, they become normal in up to half the cases. And he’s getting near 50. So he might recover, and you should be prepared for that. I mean, he should have a job when he’s recovered. He should have some training at least to get caught up on the latest. 

00:14:40
Driving nuts. 

00:14:45
I’ll put him in the hospital. 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY You visit him when he goes in? 

00:14:50
Yeah! 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY And how does he behave in the hospital? 

00:14:55
Ah… 

00:14:55
JAY HALEY Bizarre? 

00:14:55
Less anxious, he feels more secure. He only lasts only three or four days in there and that’s it. 

00:15:05
He needs a break, a vacation. 

00:15:05
Yeah! 

00:15:05
JAY HALEY You know, I think you might have (inaudible ), you know he’s been mentally ill, and that’s why he’s on disability. I’d like you to suggest that he pretend he’s normal. And if he pretends that he’s normal, how would he… how would he talk to you? And how would he talk to his wife? And make a framework of pretending. I mean, that is one way to do it, there’s other ways. But it’s… it’s a framework in which he’s expected to be normal and see if he can do any part of it. I mean, he’s either got to do it or he’s got to not do it and be just more and more bizarre to make it clear that he deserves this. 

00:15:50
So, I need this on normality in this session. What do normal couples do? 

00:15:55
JAY HALEY Sure! 

00:15:55
Normal goals. 

00:15:55
Normal goals. 

00:15:55
I mean, he can tell you… 

00:15:55
JAY HALEY And if he asks you what is normal? You can say, whatever you think is normal. 

00:16:00
JAY HALEY The therapist expresses the traditional point of view. The couple have difficulties because of biological causes, and that defines them as psychotic. The supervisor assumes that many schizophrenics are capable of being normal if a therapist can establish that expectation. It is assumed there is a social and family function to the behaviors. The therapist went into the room to interview the couple. 

00:16:30
Observing the Interview 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY The trainees and supervisor observed behind the one-way mirror. Suggestions were transferred from the supervisor to the therapist by sending them on the monitor, where the trainee, but not the client, could see the message. The suggestions from the supervisor can be grouped. Primarily the suggestion was that the therapist asked the couple if they would like to be normal. 

00:17:00
Do you see yourself as kind of a normal couple? That these are kind of normal things that happen between people? Ah… Let’s… Let’s see if we can pretend you that. You know, let’s pretend… pretend like this is a normal couple with some normal reactions here. Would you have handled yourself any differently? 

00:17:20
JAY HALEY The second major suggestion was to ask when the man planned to go to work. 

00:17:25
You’re working in computers. Is that right? 

00:17:30
Yeah! 

00:17:35
So, when do you plan to work again? 

00:17:40
JAY HALEY The man reacted normally by saying it would be scary to go to work after being out of it for eight years. The wife evidently wanted him to go to work. She suggested he could use his computer knowledge to make web pages at home. The man said he had always been treated badly at home and at work. He had been used as the world’s punching bag. He discussed his upset when the wife threatened suicide in front of him. The therapist went to the issue of work. 

00:18:10
JAY HALEY Did he say what day he could go to work - the husband can go to work? 

00:18:20
Do you both plan to go back to work and start developing a life for yourselves? Do you think in therapy here that we might set a goal in regards to work? Again, it doesn’t have to be tomorrow, it doesn’t have to be in a couple of weeks, but maybe get the idea out there that there is a possibility of returning to a type of work that’s been satisfying to you. 

00:18:45
JAY HALEY Ask her to hold his hand and encourage him. 

00:18:55
Can you hold hands here? Let’s see if we can do this. You want to look each other in eye and I want you to encourage him. I want you to give him some ah… some encouragement about maybe going back to work and how this might affect you and the relationship and maybe getting that spunk. He needs some of that spunk. 

00:19:15
JAY HALEY Say, if you are up to it, or if you think it’s right, mention that sometime you could bring in parents. 

00:19:25
You also may want to consider - and I think it’s slightly kind of interesting, not next session or the session after that, but maybe down the line - I just want you to think about ah bringing in mom and dad. 

00:19:35
JAY HALEY The therapist shifts to the parents. Could they be brought in? They say both sets of parents might come, but the husband said his father would not and should not be asked. The three main points covered were: 1. The premise is established that they can be normal. They began to argue like a normal couple. 2. Being normal means going to work and becoming self-supporting. 3. The parents need to come into therapy. 

00:20:05
It’s looked like, oh my god, is he gonna do it? 

00:20:10
Yeah! 

00:20:10
Discussing the Interview 

00:20:10
Very brave of you. 

00:20:15
Yeah! 

00:20:15
Yeah! It was the work option. It was a interesting point. Remember how I told you they were really invested in his illness. He’s really very negative about that. 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY To shake him out of that is hard. 

00:20:25
Yeah! We had a couple of good responses from him or good reactions from him. 

00:20:30
JAY HALEY He smiled a couple times. 

00:20:30
Yes, he did. 

00:20:35
JAY HALEY I thought you handled it very well. It isn’t the usual way you’ll handle it. 

00:20:40
It’s pretty close. It’s pretty close. Yeah! I liked the suggestions though. 

00:20:45
Yeah, you wouldn’t have said those things. 

00:20:45
I don’t think so. Not this time. Yeah, I don’t know if I could. 

00:20:50
But you did! 

00:20:50
So, focused on, so pushing work. I felt as pushing work a little. But I thought he was gonna respond. And usually… Because I’ve seen him get angry and maybe it’s because of the camera and all those stuff. I don’t know. I think he shut down though, in response to that you know. I don’t know how to feel better. 

00:21:15
JAY HALEY He has a patient look about him. 

00:21:15
Yeah! 

00:21:15
Now, he’s got tardive… is that what the… 

00:21:20
I saw the tapping of the foot. 

00:21:20
He’s been taking them for a long time. 

00:21:20
He is. The reason why he has a beard is because he’d clench his teeth so bad, because of the ah… the extrapyramidal syndrome, the EPS stuff. And he’ll… he’ll just clench and clench tighten up. 

00:21:40
JAY HALEY Is that ultimately changeable? 

00:21:40
No! That’s damage from the neuroleptics. 

00:21:45
JAY HALEY They’re still giving the medication to him? 

00:21:45
Yeah! You know, by the medications to offset that… that you’ll see (inaudible ). Did you see him jerk a couple times? (Inaudible ) his body will jerk. 

00:21:56
JAY HALEY If they are serving him a medication that is still harming him, he won’t have to go to work. He can manage with litigation to do very well. Because they’re supposed to stop those drugs when they show some physical harm. 

00:22:10
Some of the symptoms are irreversible even though they (inaudible ). 

00:22:16
Right! 

00:22:16
JAY HALEY That’s when they stop (inaudible ). 

00:22:17
I think he got really overwhelmed by that, you know, when she was trying to commit suicide in front of him and you know can you just imagine the chaos - the yelling, the screaming, the fighting, the tears, and all that stuff and the trauma? I think that they… that they went through about two weeks ago. 

00:22:35
JAY HALEY If she threatens suicide, you have to put them in the hospital. 

00:22:35
Group of friends, she’s got some really good girlfriends too ah… that she talks too anything. 

00:22:40
JAY HALEY (Inaudible ) diagnosis. 

00:22:45
Yeah, she was really diagnosed as depressed before, now she's schizoaffective. 

00:22:50
She has strange common symptoms. I mean, when she talks about hallucinations and some disorganization. 

00:22:55
No, see that’s new. She wasn’t hallucinating when I knew her. 

00:23:00
JAY HALEY But there wasn’t any sign of that tonight. Did you see any? 

00:23:00
No! 

00:23:00
I didn’t… I didn’t see any of the psychotic symptoms. Although they are both pretty well medicated I know that so you can see a lot of that. Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:10
JAY HALEY Well that’s a twosome. There used to be and there are enough symptoms to still diagnose them. You know, one alternative to going into the hospital is to ask them to prepare themselves so they don’t have to go in by doing what they have done before, and get them to yell and get her to swear at him. 

00:23:25
How’s… How’s it in here, doing that in the session? 

00:23:30
JAY HALEY Yeah, you could that. 

00:23:30
And ah… where it’s kind of a safe area where she could kind of ventilate and all that? 

00:23:35
And your dirty-fighting techniques. 

00:23:35
Yeah, I’ll do that. 

00:23:40
Yeah, through practice, yeah! 

00:23:40
That’s what I was thinking of. Dirty-fighting techniques! 

00:23:40
Yeah! 

00:23:40
How to… How to sabotage a relationship and teach them how to do that. 

00:23:45
JAY HALEY I’m really trying to get him to set a date of work. 

00:23:50
I think, it’s just like two times, three times, and he was resistant about doing that. I think we got him although in the idea of thinking about work and what he can do. 

00:23:55
JAY HALEY I would say that anybody would be really worried about that after eight years whether you can adapt to it now. 

00:24:05
Anybody would have that… those fears. 

00:24:05
Do you know how they live? 

00:24:10
Lucrative funds. They really do. So they might pay $200 and about for rent and in-between both of their SSI checks. At least $700, they do okay, a month. 

00:24:20
Yeah! 

00:24:20
JAY HALEY I would spend some time figuring out how much they make and what about their medical bills and so on. 

00:24:25
It’s interesting how they split up their finances this month. 

00:24:30
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:24:30
He didn’t want the dad to know. He and his dad are really apart, but now the parents… 

00:24:35
JAY HALEY He said he wouldn’t come in, right? 

00:24:35
He said the parent, yeah, his dad would not come in. 

00:24:40
JAY HALEY Because I think if you called the father, he’d come in. 

00:24:45
Yeah! 

00:24:45
JAY HALEY Are you not gonna come in for your son, just say come in. 

00:24:50
Right! He’ll come in if somebody else wants him to come in. That ought to be interesting. 

00:24:55
JAY HALEY One of the things, if you have a proper family theory, you assume that guy is failing in relation to his parents. And it’s gonna be hard to get a job, if that activates the change with the parents. 

00:25:05
Say that again. 

00:25:05
JAY HALEY Um? 

00:25:05
Say that again. 

00:25:10
JAY HALEY One of the assumptions of most family therapists from different schools is that the kid fails in life as a way of helping the parents, and what they have is a problem if he goes normal. If this guy started to go to work tomorrow, his father wouldn’t be upset. It’s the theory, even though the father wants him to go to work and succeed. So that’s it. It doesn’t mean it’s true, it means that’s… that’s the theory family therapists like, because it gives them something to do. Let’s just bring the parents in and work with them to resolve issues so the kid is free. It’s a sequence that’s happening. When the kid goes normal, the parents start to split. He gets upset and is hospitalized. They pull right together to take care of him. He gets normal, and they start to split, and that sequence goes on forever. If he came out of it, the young man would be a nice looking and an interesting guy. 

00:26:10
Yeah, and he has a nice smile. 

00:26:15
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:26:15
JAY HALEY Yeah! 

00:26:15
And he’s really invested in staying… to stay in this rut. Yeah! 

00:26:20
JAY HALEY That what makes you to think it’s his parents. 

00:26:25
I think that's something, you know, when we first started seeing him many months ago before we ended the therapy it was, you know, I kind of had that hunch that it was between him and his dad. He never was good enough. He was beaten as a child, he says; he was the punching bag, and he was the brunt of all the jokes. 

00:26:45
JAY HALEY Did you see any sign of people being schizophrenic? 

00:26:50
I nearly asked that. Ah… I have in the past, I don’t think I see it now. 

00:26:55
JAY HALEY I know, but I mean in the interview? 

00:26:55
Well, I did see some of the negative symptoms. I mean the withdrawal. (inaudible ). I don’t know that medication. It’s about isolation of the trot, some of the negative aspects of schizophrenic, you know, the negative symptoms of that ah… where it was more that it really didn’t… It’s more like an affective disorder than a schizophrenic process. I mean, I think there was a difference in that which I saw. 

00:27:25
JAY HALEY There was no sign of him hallucinating again? 

00:27:25
No, no! I didn’t ah… I didn’t get him… I didn’t see him being preoccupied or responding to an internal stimuli, I didn’t see any of that - that process happening at all. I have seen it in the past with her, but not with him. 

00:27:40
JAY HALEY The problem is when you get people who have had so much experience in therapy (inaudible ), but it’s very hard to not get involved in the things they are involved in. I mean, like how they treat each other, what they say to each other, what they think of each other. But neither one is working, going to school, or doing anything useful. You know you tend to forget that as you get involved in how they fight with each other. It’s very tempting. The whole language and the style of therapies pulls the therapist. All this person has to do is to wonder, do I really understand, and off they go. One of the problems is deciding what you’re a therapist of when you get a multi kind of problem. Or if you find his father is very upset, it is your responsibility to do something about his father. But it is interesting what responsibilities you feel you should take. I mean, a guy who is so compulsive that he leaves home at 1:00 to get here at 5:00, something should be done about it. I know what we can do with it. It’s a classic paradox. Asking him to come at 11 next time and then to wait so he gets the real feeling of what it’s like to wait wait. 

00:29:10
Yeah! He’ll do it, yeah. 

00:29:10
JAY HALEY He wouldn’t do it twice. 

00:29:15
He won’t come back. 

00:29:15
Most therapists approach to these people with the chronic, you know, chronic mental illnesses are to increase functioning to the… to the best that you can do it, to increase it if that’s a cure, you know. And you're not even looking at that you are looking at trying to get them to relate better or to do whatever they could do with them in their… 

00:29:35
To stay out of the hospital. 

00:29:35
Yeah, within their limited, and… But when you start saying, go to work and do these things, they’re gonna go, oh my god! You know. 

00:29:45
So apparently she’s in the heart to the most but, you know, in reality she’s… 

00:29:45
JAY HALEY She gives him a double-bind by taking leadership by saying he’s in charge. 

00:29:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:29:50
(Inaudible ) threaten suicide. Yeah! 

00:29:55
Like the double-bind. 

00:29:55
JAY HALEY If you were an expert therapist, you’d bring both families together for one big session. 

00:30:05
That’s what I thought we were going to do. 

00:30:05
(crosstalk)(inaudible). 

00:30:05
JAY HALEY I was thinking you can do one at a time, but you couldn't do all four. 

00:30:10
I get the impression we do all four parents. 

00:30:10
JAY HALEY What (inaudible ) was the genius of family therapy was that it shifted from the individual to the social matrix. Batson said, the mind is outside the body. He was expressing this idea that it’s not an individual problem. There’s also therapists who tell the kid to leave - don’t see your family again. I know a friend of mine who at 18 years old was lying on the couch thinking what a miserable family I have. And he decided I don’t know why I live here and he got up and he went. And I saw him when he was 20 years older and he had never seen his family again. I mean, he just ended with them. And he had a family of his own, he had a couple of kids. So, there… it works both ways. Family shut kids out, kids shut families out. 

00:31:10
Hmm…Hmm… Yeah! 

00:31:10
JAY HALEY But it’s not usual. Family therapists tend to bring them together, because they think they ought to be together. But there are some who just feel this is impossible, and they get the kids get out of the home to be safe. One contribution of family therapy was that to explain, if you have a guy who is acting strangely, you really have a choice of whether to explain it because of his ideas and manners and medication or because of his social situation. And you have two whole different theories and ideas, depending on which one of those you pick. I mean, (inaudible ) to pick the idea that he’s schizophrenic and that he’s compulsive and full of medication and that’s the problem. Or you can think about his relationship with his wife as a problem. Or you can think of his relationship with his wife and his mother as well as his father is the problem. These are all hypotheses that you can choose. 

00:32:15
But I think it’s kind of like the environment creates the biology in other words rather than the biology that’s in. 

00:32:25
JAY HALEY That’s a classic question. For you people, what’s the best theory for the therapist to have? There’s another theory for a researcher to have or another one for some other purpose in examining human beings. But for the therapists the best theory is what gives you an ideology and a way of thinking that helps you as a therapist and gives you a chance to do something instead of not being able to do anything. Okay guys. 

00:32:55
A Week - After the Interview 

00:33:00
JAY HALEY A week later the client protested he could not tolerate the idea of working. He also went over the therapist’s head and complained to colleagues that the therapist was forcing him to go to work. This made the therapist uneasy. It became clear there were a number of people involved in stabilizing the young man as a case. 

00:33:20
He got very angry and got very upset because of the suggestion that we wanted him to go back to work and he says that he’s not capable. 

00:33:30
JAY HALEY You know I would have protected, he’d either get very normal or he’d get angry and upset and be a bit bizarre. 

00:33:35
Yeah! Yeah, he got more and more upset. And what he did was he actually went to a couple of other people and was saying, you know, “oh Richard is trying to get me back to work and trying to set up kind of a crew here. And I even heard it from his doctor, his physician that I’m trying to get him back to work and he just can’t. He just can't work and he got very… He says he didn’t sleep all night. That he was tossing and turning, that he got very, very upset over the whole situation and he had his symptoms came back, he said. And he told me that he was hearing voices all night long and he just was so worried about the whole work detail. She wasn’t aware of these symptoms. She wasn’t aware of all the problems and only he was a little more irritable. But he let her know that he was having great difficulties and problems with what was been said. And how he distorted it was that I was mandating him to go to work next week and that he needed to prepare himself next week to get a job. And I was the supreme being telling him that he has to do something and that he got very angry towards me. I could still tell that he was quite angry that I would ever, ever suggest that he was normal; that he can get a job and go back into the workforce. 

00:34:50
JAY HALEY Did she have any objection to that work? 

00:34:55
You know, she didn’t. Actually, she wants to go to work. She says that she starts thinking about work and she has good thoughts about work and that she would like to go to work. He comes in and says, “oh, not for me I just can’t do it. I’m just not going to be able to do that. I can’t handle being around people.” I mean, I heard everything. 

00:35:10
JAY HALEY What would you assume from that one? 

00:35:15
Ah… Again I… I think that he is really invested in the illness. I think he is really scared about losing some of the benefits that he gets. I think that’s what I was assuming was that that he is really worried that he would lose the benefits. 

00:35:30
JAY HALEY But your hypothesis is that it’s an individual problem in gaining money and so on? 

00:35:35
I asked again about his parents - bringing his folks in and bringing, you know, everybody in together. And he said that they’d be willing to except his dad won’t. And I said, “how about contacting your dad?” “No!” He doesn’t want any contact. He doesn’t want me to talk to his dad. That kind of made me think a little bit and that I think that he might feel that I might talk to his dad about him getting a job and about his normality. 

00:36:00
JAY HALEY That’s what will happen. Well, if you push him to go to work, he’s going to get angry. 

00:36:05
Get angry. Yeah! 

00:36:05
JAY HALEY Then your question is what hypothesis is best for a therapist to have in relation to that? 

00:36:10
Yeah! 

00:36:10
JAY HALEY And one, it’s family oriented - that gives you more things to do. You’ve got him, you’ve got his mother, you’ve got his father. And you didn’t push it any further about going to work? 

00:36:20
You know, I backed off from that issue I did, I did, yeah, just ah… My feeling of backing off a little bit, because he just… he wouldn’t let it go. There's a kind of I kind of reflected a little bit on myself a little bit too. I mean, I didn’t want him to say, Oh, did this and did that. I guess I was kind of protecting myself a little bit - trying to give him a little understanding that I really wasn’t pushing him to go next week, maybe down the line. I wanted to clarify it a little more. So, some honesty here is that I was kind of somewhat concerned about that. 

00:36:50
JAY HALEY You would have been thought wrong for pushing him. Is that right? 

00:36:55
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I think, I still needed to get back and have a little more ah… little more trust there with him. 

00:37:05
JAY HALEY I think the movement would come more from the wife. If you got together with the wife on how improved he would be if he went to work, and she’ll agree. Because I’m sure she wants him to go to work. 

00:37:20
Yes, she does. I wouldn’t be doing my job if you weren’t showing some improvement and getting better. And ah… it kind of made him think just a little bit and then he says, “well a job is not the thing to get me better. What I need is more medication and more communication.” I mean, again, he’s so-so invested in his illness. 

00:37:40
JAY HALEY Well, it’s a career and it’s a paid career. You didn’t bring that up, though? 

00:37:45
I thought it would be a little callous to do that. 

00:37:50
JAY HALEY You could say to her really, how much would you lose if you went to work? You could say there must be different motivations for not going to work and one is money. 

00:38:05
Actually, I asked them about their finances also. They're on (inaudible ) so they pay a $185 a month for rent. He gets $720 a month and she gets $640 a month. So and.. and that is tax free. That’s everything. And then they get all their medical and all the stuff paid for. Their medications are paid for. And their car is paid for. So I think their total expenditures came out around $250 and that’s including gas and they’re making $1,000. They have about $1,000 extra cash just to buy and spend and do whatever they want with that. 

00:38:45
JAY HALEY He’s probably made those calculations. 

00:38:45
Oh yeah, oh yeah! 

00:38:50
JAY HALEY But I think you need to get those parents in somehow. 

00:38:50
Yeah! I think so, too. I think so too. It’s a challenge almost. 

00:38:55
JAY HALEY And you didn’t try both pair of parents? 

00:39:00
Her parents (inaudible ). Her parents, I think, they wanted to come in. I… I… I would like to have actually the whole group. 

00:39:05
JAY HALEY Sure! But I think if he doesn’t want his father you can have the wife and her parents. 

00:39:10
Yeah! 

00:39:10
JAY HALEY And they're not gonna approve (inaudible ) I don’t think. He's been married what three times? 

00:39:16
Three times! Yeah! 

00:39:20
Every single one? 

00:39:20
JAY HALEY But you can always bring the family together and say this is an important time when your son or daughter or whoever it is, is reaching a point where they can step forward or they cannot step forward. And I would like to help you get off into a new world. You say to the parents, if you thought your son-in-law was successful, what would he be doing? And they’ll say go to work. That’s what they’ll say. 

00:39:50
Oh yeah, yeah! They don’t really want to… He doesn’t wanna go to work and he’s made it quite clear that that’s not his focus. 

00:39:55
JAY HALEY He’s worked hard to get where he is today. 

00:39:55
He’s worked very hard to get where he is today. 

00:40:00
JAY HALEY Yeah that’s right. You could try bringing in the wife with her parents and the couple, just saying you need to gather information you know. 

00:40:10
And then look at the areas of success? 

00:40:10
JAY HALEY Focus on success, and also it sets an example for his family if these people would come in. Because his father must be in trouble, or his mother or somebody is. 

00:40:25
Ah…Hmm… You’d assume that there’s problems in their relationship or not the son and his father but that you're assuming that it’s the marriage of his parents? 

00:40:40
JAY HALEY The marriage of his parents, I would assume was a problem, yeah. 

00:40:40
It’s a problem. 

00:40:45
You didn’t know they were married. You didn’t even know they were married? 

00:40:50
Yeah, I thought that they were divorced for some reason. 

00:40:55
JAY HALEY Well, okay, we’ll look forward to future reports. If you want to bring him in here next week, that would be nice too. 

00:41:00
The couple is coming in at 7. 

00:41:00
Two Weeks After the Live Interview 

00:41:05
(Inaudible ) he was in the group of this peers and other people so I was in the group there. And one of the ladies who was talking started talking more about how horrible she feels and of her depression and that she’s sick. And he became upset. He became very angry that that she is being sick and he says, “well it seems to me you are playing the sick role and that you are doing it well.” So the process actually turned back on him and he says, well, I need to start getting my life back together. And I said, Such as? He goes, well, maybe work. And it was like from anger right after our session, he was angry for about a week and then all of a sudden in a group he turns around and says this. I mean it was like great. He started talking about being normal and didn’t want to be looked at as abnormal. And it was, I mean, words were good but I hope his behavior follows through. But ah… but his ah… he got some anger out of him. A little animation, which I thought was kind of good. 

00:42:20
JAY HALEY I think you should take credit for that. 

00:42:20
Well, thank you. 

00:42:25
You work with him. Richard has credit ‘cos you did that with the guy? 

00:42:30
JAY HALEY We should have… I think in both ways. But I wouldn't hesitate to give credit to the guy. The guy is been patient for so long, that if you come in and change him (inaudible ). And you have to plan that. 

00:42:45
She got herself a computer through this free computer service that we got her hooked up with and she got a new computer for free, so long as she joins the internet. And he goes over there and programs the whole thing and gets it all set up for her and feels like validated for some of the work he’s done. And he liked it. He enjoyed it. And that’s what I think (inaudible ). 

00:43:06
JAY HALEY That’s what I would emphasize you know. That’s aggressive. Because I think that session when you pushed him to be more active and get a job and so on, he’s got to react either by doing that positively, because you timed it with the changes in his life, or he’s got to relapse and complain and say it’s awful and I’ve got to work. I don’t want to work and so on. What he does is he reacted negatively, and that a week later he shifted. 

00:43:35
Right! 

00:43:35
JAY HALEY So, you had that delay first. 

00:43:35
Yeah, yeah it’s at first. Actually, within the last couple of weeks there has been no hospitalization treatment too, whereas it was pretty frequent before. 

00:43:45
JAY HALEY What’s interesting is they get shocked with the idea that that they should be normal. It’s a very upsetting idea. 

00:43:55
Hmm…Hmm… Well, it’s scary, I think, for a lot of them too. 

00:44:00
JAY HALEY The second week he said to the group that he decided he didn’t like being considered abnormal. He decided to go to work. He began by setting up a computer system for a woman friend that was partly at job and showed he was capable. The therapist and the viewer have the choice of believing the client is too abnormal to go to work to support himself, or one can believe he is capable of going to work but does not for social reasons. Each point of view has its merits and its consequences to the life of the couple and the staff. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:40
The couple had come to one live supervised session. Two months later the husband left for another state to live with a relative. Neither wife nor therapist heard from him. At a six month follow-up, the wife was back in therapy. camera Madeleine Richeport-Haley editors Madeleine Richeport-Haley Jay Haley technical consultant Eric L.
