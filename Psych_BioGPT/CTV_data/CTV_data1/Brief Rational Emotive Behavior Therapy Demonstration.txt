Brief REBT Albert Ellis, Ph.D. 

00:01:05
ALBERT ELLIS Quiet, please. I'm going to give some brief therapy procedures, brief therapy of rational emotive behavior therapy to some of you lucky souls will come up at no extra charge to be cured, and I'll show you briefly how REBT can be done. And then maybe we'll have time for discussion later, depending on how many volunteers I am able to talk with. Now, who is the first volunteer? 

00:01:45
[sil.] 

00:02:00
MARY Hi, I'm Mary. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Let me help you with that, make sure it goes right. 

00:02:05
MARY Thank you. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Like this. 

00:02:10
MARY Do you have a better ear? 

00:02:15
ALBERT ELLIS I can't hear you. Talk louder. 

00:02:15
MARY Do you have a better year? 

00:02:20
ALBERT ELLIS The right one is a little better. 

00:02:20
MARY Okay. 

00:02:20
ALBERT ELLIS But I have hearing aids and, so we'll see if I hear you. What is your first name? 

00:02:25
MARY My first name is Mary. 

00:02:25
ALBERT ELLIS Okay, Mary. what problem bothers you that you'd like to start with? 

00:02:30
MARY I would like to start and finish with, um, I continually, I have a pattern in my life when I have supervisors who in my opinion I don't think are really good ones- 

00:02:45
ALBERT ELLIS Right, right. 

00:02:45
MARY ... I end up- 

00:02:50
ALBERT ELLIS Which is normal. 

00:02:50
MARY Right. I end up, I, uh, I usually react to that with a combination of intimidation, uh, anger, judging back at them, uh, feeling more competent than them. 

00:03:05
ALBERT ELLIS Well- 

00:03:05
MARY And it's really disturbing. 

00:03:05
ALBERT ELLIS Would you rather start off with the anger or the intimidation when the supervisor isn't as hot as he or she could be? Which do you mainly feel, angry or intimidated? 

00:03:20
MARY I think first is intimidation. 

00:03:25
ALBERT ELLIS Intimidation. 

00:03:25
MARY Yes. 

00:03:30
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. Uh, A. Adversity, will assume you are right and the supervisor is a pain in the ass. 

00:03:35
MARY Right. 

00:03:35
ALBERT ELLIS So, And that C. you feel intimidated, meaning partly self-doubting and upset about it. Now, according to our theory, rational emotive behavior therapy, you are telling yourself something at B. The belief system, the bull shipped you tell yourself about A. 

00:03:55
MARY Right. 

00:04:00
ALBERT ELLIS And I already know what it is, but let's see if you can discover it. 

00:04:00
MARY Alright. 

00:04:05
ALBERT ELLIS What, what are you telling yourself when you feel intimidated? 

00:04:10
MARY I'm telling myself when I feel intimidated they're right. 

00:04:15
ALBERT ELLIS They're right and that makes me what? 

00:04:20
MARY Angry. 

00:04:20
ALBERT ELLIS No, anger is the other thing were going to- 

00:04:20
MARY Oh, okay. Well, it makes me angry they think they're right. No. 

00:04:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right, we'll- 

00:04:25
MARY I have guilt they're right. 

00:04:30
ALBERT ELLIS We'll get to the anger. 

00:04:30
MARY Okay. 

00:04:30
ALBERT ELLIS when you're intimidated, you're saying that they are intimidating me and we're assuming that's correct, you're not paranoid and they actually are intimidating you and that means what about me to be intimidated? 

00:04:45
MARY I can be too easily control. 

00:04:50
ALBERT ELLIS Too? 

00:04:55
MARY Easily controlled. 

00:04:55
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. They too easily control me and therefore I'm too weak or intimidate a full or something like that. Alright. 

00:05:05
MARY I'm less than. 

00:05:05
ALBERT ELLIS I'm what? 

00:05:10
MARY Less than. 

00:05:10
ALBERT ELLIS At? 

00:05:10
MARY I'm less than. 

00:05:10
ALBERT ELLIS Left? 

00:05:10
MARY Less, like more or less. 

00:05:15
ALBERT ELLIS Less than them. They're a pain in the ass but I'm even less. 

00:05:25
MARY Right. 

00:05:30
ALBERT ELLIS well, they can't intimidate you unless you give them permission to, and you're giving them permission to intimidate you, not to act badly. They can easily do it on their own. 

00:05:45
MARY Yes. 

00:05:45
ALBERT ELLIS They're talented screwballs who act badly on their own. But they can't intimidate you. Only you can. And you're saying when they try to intimidate me and lord it over me and give me bad supervision, that that makes me a lesser person, right? 

00:06:05
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:06:05
ALBERT ELLIS alright, now how does it make you a lesser person, sink low down? Tow does it make you lesser? it could be very annoying and we'll get the anger later, but how can their words, gestures and attitude lower you? How can that? 

00:06:30
[sil.] 

00:06:30
MARY I'm not- 

00:06:35
ALBERT ELLIS Do they have a magical power to make you a dwarf? 

00:06:35
MARY No, but they have, they have policies and procedures that because there in a hierarchical top-of-the-line they have, uh, or believe they have. 

00:06:50
ALBERT ELLIS So they could do you in. 

00:06:50
MARY Yes. 

00:06:50
ALBERT ELLIS But let's assume they could do you in, and that's very unfortunate if they do you in, but I think they can't intimidate you. You are the only one that can intimidate you. They can stand on their goddamn heads but it won't intimidate you unless you say things like, "I am a lesser person." Now, how again when they try to intimidate you doesn't make you a lesser person? Give me the magic that produces lesser people. 

00:07:25
MARY They don't make a lesser person. I feel like a lesser person. 

00:07:30
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, because you are telling yourself- 

00:07:35
MARY That I'm a lesser person. 

00:07:35
ALBERT ELLIS ...that you're a lesser person. And why are you telling yourself that crap? 

00:07:40
MARY You know, I've asked myself that over and over and over and over. 

00:07:45
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:07:50
MARY Why am I telling myself that crap? 

00:07:50
ALBERT ELLIS I'll tell you why. 

00:07:50
MARY Thank you. 

00:07:50
ALBERT ELLIS Because you were saying inferentially that in order to be a normal, good, effective person, "I must do so well that they most except me and never try to intimidate me." 

00:08:05
MARY Yeah. 

00:08:10
ALBERT ELLIS Well, why... It would be nice if you did well and it would be nice if they didn't try to intimidate you, but why must you be so good as to impress these bitches and bastards? 

00:08:20
MARY I, I want them, I, I want to please them. I want them to- 

00:08:25
ALBERT ELLIS That's good! 

00:08:25
MARY ...recognize me for my own greatness and contribution. 

00:08:30
ALBERT ELLIS That's good. Keep your wants, your preference. I wish to hell that I pleased them- 

00:08:35
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:08:35
ALBERT ELLIS ...and got great supervision, got great marks for the supervision. Ahat I wish. But you're jumping to, 'Because I wish it, it has to be. I have to please these people or else I'm no good.' Do you see that you're making that jump? 

00:08:55
MARY I'm connecting to wishing it to it must happen. 

00:09:00
ALBERT ELLIS You're- 

00:09:00
MARY Just simply because I wish it to be so. 

00:09:00
ALBERT ELLIS That's right and your taking of that event, there not giving you good supervision, let's assume that's true. 

00:09:05
MARY Yeah. 

00:09:10
ALBERT ELLIS And you're making it into a whole new cost. 

00:09:10
MARY Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:09:15
ALBERT ELLIS Now, why must they give you good supervision and prove that you're okay? Why must they? Give me a reason. 

00:09:30
MARY Will you ask me that question again? Would you ask me that question again, please? 

00:09:35
ALBERT ELLIS It would be nice, pleasant, good, effective if they were good supervisors and they except that you as a supervisee. That's your wish, your preference. 

00:09:50
MARY Right. 

00:09:50
ALBERT ELLIS Your very strong preference. That's okay. But why must they follow that preference and be okay in their own right? 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:05
ALBERT ELLIS Where is it written? 

00:10:05
MARY Where is it heard? 

00:10:10
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:10:10
MARY Oh. 

00:10:10
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:10:10
MARY Yeah. It's written in here that- 

00:10:15
ALBERT ELLIS It's the 11th commandment. 

00:10:15
MARY Right. 

00:10:15
ALBERT ELLIS Thy supervisors must never try to intimidate me. 

00:10:25
[sil.] 

00:10:25
MARY Very good point. 

00:10:25
ALBERT ELLIS You see? 

00:10:25
MARY I think I just snorted. 

00:10:30
ALBERT ELLIS You see how ridiculous that is? 

00:10:30
MARY You're good. Not everyone can get me to snort. 

00:10:35
ALBERT ELLIS Now, what could you say to yourself so you would not be intimidated? They're trying to intimidate you. They're doing you in. They're lousy supervisors. A. Adversity. What can you tell yourself so nobody in the world could intimidate you? What could you say to yourself and believe? 

00:11:00
MARY Wh-, what I try to say and have been trying to do to get rid of it is, just I am good and wise and true, period. 

00:11:05
ALBERT ELLIS Um, okay. 

00:11:10
MARY Regardless of what anyone else- 

00:11:10
ALBERT ELLIS That's right. 

00:11:10
MARY ...believe. 

00:11:15
ALBERT ELLIS I don't like their putting me down, giving me bad marks and things like that, giving me lousy supervision, but the only one who can intimidate me is me, and I stubbornly refuse to be intimidated by these fuckers. 

00:11:35
[sil.] 

00:11:35
MARY Do you think I should just, like, say that out loud? 

00:11:35
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, say it! 

00:11:40
MARY I refuse to be intimdated by these fuckers! 

00:11:45
ALBERT ELLIS That's right! Now, say that a hundred times till you really believe it. 

00:11:55
MARY I'll knock on the wall. 

00:11:55
ALBERT ELLIS That's part of your homework. 

00:11:55
MARY Yeah. 

00:12:00
ALBERT ELLIS To keep saying to yourself- 

00:12:00
MARY Okay. 

00:12:00
ALBERT ELLIS They're not so hot and they do me in and they don't give me who-, good supervision and they try to intimidate me but damn it I refuse to be intimdiated by anyone! No one can intimidate me because, as Eleanor Roosevelt said, no one can insult me without my permission. 

00:12:25
MARY My permission. 

00:12:25
ALBERT ELLIS See? 

00:12:25
MARY Yes, she did. 

00:12:30
ALBERT ELLIS So, you are giving them permission. 

00:12:30
MARY Yes, I am. 

00:12:30
ALBERT ELLIS Now, let's get to your anger. 

00:12:35
MARY I feel weird now. 

00:12:35
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:12:40
MARY Oh, god. Okay. 

00:12:40
ALBERT ELLIS Okay, and there again adversity, we're assuming that they're doing you in. They're trying to intimidate you. They're not very good supervisors. That's factual. We're assuming it's correct. And then C. you feel angry at them, furious, enraged- 

00:12:55
MARY Yes. 

00:12:55
ALBERT ELLIS ...at them. Now, what are you telling yourself to create your anger when you're angry? 

00:13:05
MARY Hmm. 

00:13:05
ALBERT ELLIS You're saying something to yourself about them. They what? 

00:13:15
MARY I, oh, ah. I think the anger, I think the an-, when I feel the anger- 

00:13:20
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:13:25
MARY ...I'm saying to myself, "God don't let them be right. Don't let them be right. Don't let them be right." So- 

00:13:30
ALBERT ELLIS Don't... 

00:13:30
MARY Don't let them be right. Don't let them be correct. 

00:13:35
ALBERT ELLIS Well, but that again would be- 

00:13:35
MARY Not make me angry. 

00:13:35
ALBERT ELLIS ...intimidation- 

00:13:35
MARY Okay. 

00:13:35
ALBERT ELLIS ...and self-doubting, but when you're really enraged, angry, you feel it, your anger, then you're saying something about them. You're saying- 

00:13:50
MARY Ooh! 

00:13:50
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:13:50
MARY God, I hope they're not here! , is, is this something they coulod buy someday? Um, I'm saying they absolutely have no right, that they're, they don't know what, they don't know what they're talking about. 

00:14:05
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:14:10
MARY They're, they have no clue to- 

00:14:10
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:14:10
MARY ...wh-, what it is I am doing in my performance. 

00:14:15
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:14:15
MARY I'm saying things like they're stupid. 

00:14:20
ALBERT ELLIS Right, as they shouldn't be. 

00:14:20
MARY Right. 

00:14:20
ALBERT ELLIS Why the fuck shouldn't they be as stupid as they are? 

00:14:30
MARY Well, you have a good point there. 

00:14:30
ALBERT ELLIS Thanks. You see, if you're correct and they're acting stupidly a lot of the time- 

00:14:40
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:14:40
ALBERT ELLIS ...which most supervisors are. 

00:14:40
MARY Right. 

00:14:40
ALBERT ELLIS Let's face that. 

00:14:45
MARY Well, they are. That's the thing. 

00:14:45
ALBERT ELLIS Then they have to act stupidly when they act stupidly. There's no other option. 

00:14:50
MARY Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:14:55
ALBERT ELLIS You see? And you're saying they must not do, act stupidly but they're invariably doing- 

00:15:00
MARY Right. 

00:15:00
ALBERT ELLIS Now, isn't that crazy? 

00:15:05
MARY Yeah. 

00:15:05
ALBERT ELLIS Right? 

00:15:05
MARY Just a little bit. Yeah. 

00:15:05
ALBERT ELLIS So, what could you change that to? Because let's assume they're acting very stupidly. Now, what- 

00:15:15
MARY Gosh, they're really acting very stupidly. 

00:15:20
ALBERT ELLIS Too fucking bad. 

00:15:25
MARY You really are good. 

00:15:25
ALBERT ELLIS You think? I wish to hell that they would act intelligently. 

00:15:30
MARY But it's too fucking bad they act stupid. 

00:15:30
ALBERT ELLIS And they're probably incapable of acting intelligently. 

00:15:35
MARY Acting intelligently. That I completely agree with. Yeah. 

00:15:40
ALBERT ELLIS Right. You see? So, you are saying that people who are incapable of acting adequately and intelligently, they, they have to do something. That's crazy. 

00:15:50
MARY Yeah. 

00:15:55
ALBERT ELLIS That's a contradiction. They can't. So if you would work on that, you would really change first your intimidation and second your anger and you still feel very, very sorry and displeased with their behavior because it's not good, not getting what you want, but you wouldn't be intimidate a bowl and angry at them. 

00:16:20
MARY Right. 

00:16:20
ALBERT ELLIS You see? Now, when you're intimidatable and you let them, make them intimidate you, how do you feel about you for letting yourself be intimidatable? 

00:16:35
MARY Um, I get pretty angry at myself. 

00:16:35
ALBERT ELLIS So- 

00:16:35
MARY Because it's really a waste of my energy. 

00:16:40
ALBERT ELLIS Right, because you're saying to yourself, "I must not be intimidatable. I must not be intimidatable." 

00:16:40
MARY Yeah. 

00:16:45
ALBERT ELLIS "But I am." Then you're gonna get very angry at yourself for being intimidatable by them. So, first of all you're putting yourself down being intimidated. 

00:16:55
MARY Right. 

00:17:00
ALBERT ELLIS Then you're calling yourself a shit for being intimidated. 

00:17:00
MARY Yes, I am. Yes, I am. 

00:17:05
ALBERT ELLIS That won't work. So, what you do, you do a backwards. First, you accept you with the intimidation and say, "It's bad, it's stupid for me to be intimidated, but right now that's the way I am and I'm not a louse, a worm, a loser for being intimidated. But it's wrong." 

00:17:25
MARY Okay. 

00:17:25
ALBERT ELLIS "It won't get me what I want." then you get back to the intimidation itself, that they should respect me and they should not try to intimidate me and you say, "Shit, that's the way they are. I refuse again to be intimidated." See? 

00:17:45
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:17:45
ALBERT ELLIS Now, is there anything practical that you could do to get them to be less intimidating and to bother you? Is there anything you, it's in your power to change about their behavior? Can you do it? 

00:18:05
MARY Th-, I could, um, if I spent less energy in the anger- 

00:18:10
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:18:10
MARY ...and being intimidated, and if I could do just, I could contribute a little bit... A00:18:20]They're uncomfortable people. 

00:18:15
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:18:15
MARY They're very uncomfortable people. 

00:18:15
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:18:25
MARY And if I chose to do it, I could, I could less then the angst out of the environment- 

00:18:30
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:18:30
MARY ...by contributing a little bit more to their comfort. 

00:18:35
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, that's very good, and what's more if you accept them without anger and without intimidation, etc., and show down then without the anger- 

00:18:45
MARY Right. 

00:18:45
ALBERT ELLIS ...that you don't like what they're doing but they are not lice or shits for doing it- 

00:18:50
MARY Right. 

00:18:50
ALBERT ELLIS ...then maybe, maybe, maybe they'll change. Even supervisors can change. 

00:19:00
MARY Mm-hmm. Even supervisors, yeah. 

00:19:00
ALBERT ELLIS See? But you'd better first be unangry at them because if you're angry at them, they get angry at you back and there's a hopelessness. 

00:19:10
MARY Right. 

00:19:10
ALBERT ELLIS so, first work on your feelings of intimidation and anger, rage and then work on let's see if there's anything practical I can do to possibly help them to be less stupid than they are. 

00:19:25
MARY Yeah, 'cause they're really not, they're not bad people. They're just stupid. 

00:19:30
ALBERT ELLIS Right. That, that's just it. 

00:19:30
MARY Right. 

00:19:35
ALBERT ELLIS they're doing bad things in your estimation, and you could get other people to agree with you, but they are not bad. 

00:19:40
MARY Right. 

00:19:45
ALBERT ELLIS so don't put them down, put down their behavior and then maybe, maybe, maybe you'll be able to help them change. Now, let's give you rational emotive imagery, and emotive evocative way of doing the same thing. We've been disputing your irrational, dysfunctional beliefs but this is a different way. Close your eyes and imagine the worst that they get worse and worse and worse. They're very bigoted, prejudiced against you. They make nasty remarks. They don't help you in any way and they still keep getting worse and worse. Can you vividly imagine that? 

00:20:25
MARY Yes. 

00:20:25
ALBERT ELLIS Easily. 

00:20:25
MARY Yes, easily. 

00:20:30
ALBERT ELLIS and how do you feel, honestly feel in your gut and your heart as you vividly imagine that happening? 

00:20:35
MARY I really feel rejected. 

00:20:40
ALBERT ELLIS Rejected. 

00:20:40
MARY Absolutely. 

00:20:45
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. Make yourself feel rejected, low, down, maybe depressed. Feel as rejected as you can be and the feelings usually are depression that go with it. Feel depressed, low, rejected, rejected, rejected. Feel it! Get in touch with it. feel it as much as you actually can. Don't suppress it or repress it. just feel very low and rejected. Are you now feeling it? 

00:21:15
MARY Yes. 

00:21:15
ALBERT ELLIS Right. You really seem like you're feeling it. 

00:21:20
MARY Yes, I am feeling it. 

00:21:20
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. That's very good. 

00:21:20
MARY Thank you. 

00:21:20
ALBERT ELLIS Now, you control your emotional reaction. You don't control them. Now, with the same image, there being as bad as they can be and you feel very, very depressed, rejected, make yourself feel instead very sorry and a very disappointed in their behavior but not depressed, not rejected or anything like that. Just very sorry and disappointed at their behaving the way they do, not dejected, not rejected, not depressed and tell me when you only feel sorry and disappointed about what they're doing and not doing as supervisors. 

00:22:15
MARY I'm feeling disappointed. 

00:22:15
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. 

00:22:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:22:15
ALBERT ELLIS Open your eyes. how do you change your feelings from the negative but unhealthy feeling of rejection, of depression, etc. to the healthy negative feeling of sorrow and disappointment. How did you do that? 

00:22:35
MARY I was, I was able to step back. 

00:22:35
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, you step back. 

00:22:40
MARY Step back and look at the way things are right here, right now. Not necessasrily right here right now, but right here right now in that situation. 

00:22:45
ALBERT ELLIS Right. You looked back and saw thee way things are and said what about them that make you feel disappointed and sorry. What did ya say to yourself about the way things are? 

00:23:00
MARY I'm sorry they're not, I'm sorry they're not better than they are. 

00:23:05
ALBERT ELLIS That's good. I'm sorry. I regret that they're not better than they are. Too damn bad. 

00:23:10
MARY Right. 

00:23:10
ALBERT ELLIS But they're not. 

00:23:10
MARY Right. 

00:23:10
ALBERT ELLIS You see? Now that will really produce it, you see? 

00:23:15
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:15
ALBERT ELLIS That's a very good way of changing your attitude, your philosophy and thereby changing your feelings. 

00:23:20
MARY Right. 

00:23:20
ALBERT ELLIS But we want you to feel. We don't want you to feel happy about the situation. We don't want you to feel neutral. You can feel very disappointed and sorry. 

00:23:30
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:30
ALBERT ELLIS But it's unethical to feel depressed. 

00:23:35
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:23:35
ALBERT ELLIS You know why? Why it's unethical to- 

00:23:40
MARY Why? 

00:23:40
ALBERT ELLIS Because it's against you! 

00:23:45
MARY Yeah. 

00:23:45
ALBERT ELLIS You're being unethical to you, while sorrow and regret, disappointment will help you cope with the situation. 

00:23:50
MARY That feels more diginified, also. 

00:23:55
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:23:55
MARY I mean, it feels more, there's more self-dignity feeling- 

00:23:55
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:23:55
MARY ...in that. 

00:24:00
ALBERT ELLIS Right. So, that's very good. Now, we want you to practice that. It only took you about a minute or two to change your feeling, so every day for the next 30 days, not forever- 

00:24:10
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:24:15
ALBERT ELLIS I want you to imagine the worst, like, like I told you, feel if ya still feel very depressed, low, down, intimidated, etc., feel low, low, low, change it the way you just did to sorrow and regret and disappointment. 

00:24:30
MARY Disappointment. 

00:24:35
ALBERT ELLIS And every day do that with what you told yourself, really solidify it and use several other coping statements, such as, "It's really rough working with people like these but damn it, I can take it." 

00:24:50
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:24:50
ALBERT ELLIS Ya see? And then if you do that every day for only a minute or two a day you'll gradually train yourself to unconsciously, un-, automatically feel sorry, regretful, disappointed, instead of horrified, terrified, down and depressed. 

00:25:10
MARY Mm-hmm. 

00:25:10
ALBERT ELLIS Now, will ya do that every day in a week for a couple of minutes or so for 30 days? Will you do it? 

00:25:15
MARY Will I do it? 

00:25:15
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:25:20
MARY You bet! Sure. 

00:25:20
ALBERT ELLIS Alright! 

00:25:20
MARY Yeah. Thank you. 

00:25:20
ALBERT ELLIS Just in case ya don't, we give you operant conditioning. 

00:25:25
MARY Okay. I thought this was really brief. 

00:25:30
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. What, what do you like to do that you do almost every day of the week just because ya like it? What? 

00:25:40
MARY Mmm. 

00:25:40
ALBERT ELLIS For pleasure. 

00:25:45
MARY Um, look at flowers. Look at flowers. 

00:25:50
ALBERT ELLIS Look at flowers? 

00:25:50
MARY Yeah, gardening. 

00:25:50
ALBERT ELLIS Okay. After ya do the rational emotive imagry and change your view, then you can look at the flowers. 

00:25:55
MARY Mm-hmm. I pet my cat. 

00:26:00
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. Right. What do ya hate to do, some chore or task which you normally don't do because you hate it? You won't do it. 

00:26:10
MARY Uh, housework. 

00:26:10
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:26:10
MARY Housework. 

00:26:10
ALBERT ELLIS Oh, yeah. Housework. Most people tell me housework. 

00:26:15
MARY Yeah. 

00:26:15
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. If said time arrives in any of the next 30 days and ya haven't done- 

00:26:25
MARY Oh my gosh! 

00:26:25
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:26:25
MARY I have to do housework? 

00:26:25
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. Ya have to stay up for an hour doing housework. 

00:26:25
MARY Ew. 

00:26:30
ALBERT ELLIS And if the house gets too clean, ya clean your neighbor's house. 

00:26:35
[sil.] 

00:26:40
ALBERT ELLIS Anything about this central problem of anger and intimidation that we may have importantly omit, omitted? Anything that... We covered the field? 

00:26:55
MARY I think you covered, we covered the field. 

00:26:55
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. Thank you for coming up. 

00:26:55
MARY Thank you very much. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
MARY Thank you. 

00:27:10
ALBERT ELLIS Goodbye. Okay, who's going to be next? 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:30
MOLLY Under my back? 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, let me get this on correctly. 

00:27:40
MOLLY Okay. Like that? Okay. Hi. 

00:27:45
ALBERT ELLIS Okay. Hi. What is your first name? 

00:27:50
MOLLY I'm Molly. 

00:27:50
ALBERT ELLIS Mol? 

00:27:50
MOLLY Molly. 

00:27:50
ALBERT ELLIS Molly. Okay, Molly. What problem would you like to bring up. 

00:27:55
MOLLY Only one? 

00:27:55
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. 

00:28:00
MOLLY Um, I have a control issue. 

00:28:00
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, a control issue. 

00:28:00
MOLLY Yes, yes. 

00:28:00
ALBERT ELLIS Which is? 

00:28:05
MOLLY Um, I like to control everybody. I like to control everybody. 

00:28:10
ALBERT ELLIS You have to control everybody, right? 

00:28:10
MOLLY What they do. 

00:28:10
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:28:15
MOLLY What they think. 

00:28:15
ALBERT ELLIS And if they, if you can't control them, which obviously you sometimes can't, how do ya feel? 

00:28:20
MOLLY Pissed off. 

00:28:20
ALBERT ELLIS Again? 

00:28:25
MOLLY Really pissed off. 

00:28:25
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. Angry- 

00:28:25
MOLLY Yes. 

00:28:25
ALBERT ELLIS ...at them for not being controlled. 

00:28:35
[sil.] 

00:28:35
ALBERT ELLIS Because when you're angry at uncontrollable people, what are ya telling yourself to make yourself angry? They're uncontrollable and you're angry. Now, what is in your head to make you angry at those poor, uncontrollable people? 

00:28:55
MOLLY That I'm not good enough to be able to change what they're doing. 

00:28:55
ALBERT ELLIS That I'm not good enough to be able to change them. I want to change them but they're not controllable and that makes me no good. I'm not good enough to control them. Which another way of saying is I must control these people or else I'm not good enough as a person. Alright, first of all why do you have to control them? Where is it written that you must control these people? 

00:29:30
MOLLY Nowhere. 

00:29:30
ALBERT ELLIS But you're saying it, saying very strongly. It is written nowhere because they are in their own control and even if you're right suggesting control and they won't listen, they have a right to be wrong and uncontrollable. So, you better work on your anger. But do ya, ya also feel when they're out of control that there's something wrong with you for not contolling them, right? Right. How do you arrive at that? Because they're not controllable, that's a, that's right but how does it make you a lesser individual just because you can't control the bastards? 

00:30:15
MOLLY I think that, that if they're my friends or they're people I care about that they would, they would care about me, too and want to do what I want them to do to make me happy. 

00:30:25
ALBERT ELLIS Well, that would be preferrable. 

00:30:30
[sil.] 

00:30:35
ALBERT ELLIS It would be nice if everybody in the world found out what you want them to do and kissed your ass and did it. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:45
ALBERT ELLIS So, that would be highly preferrable but why do they have to act preferrably as far as being controlled by you? Why must they? 

00:31:00
MOLLY I don't know. Because I'm right? 

00:31:00
ALBERT ELLIS What? 

00:31:00
MOLLY Because I'm right? 

00:31:05
ALBERT ELLIS Well, let's suppose you're right and they're wrong. Why haven't they the inalienable right to be wrong and screw up of your advising them not to? Why ust they be right the way you're right? 

00:31:25
MOLLY I don't know. 

00:31:25
ALBERT ELLIS Obviously, if they must be right, they would be right and they're wrong. How can they be right when they're wrong? 

00:31:35
MOLLY That's a good question. 

00:31:35
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, a very good question, but again let's take you feel less of a person. Now, even if they deliberately are not listening to you and they even know you're right but they deliberately ignore that, that's bad because you're not getting what you want and they're out of control, but how does ineffectuality to effect them, you're unable to effect them, make you a lesser individual? How does it? 

00:32:10
MOLLY Well, I know that logically it doesn't, but it still feels like it does. 

00:32:15
ALBERT ELLIS Well, but prove that it does. If ya, you could feel for example that you're a kangaroo and I say to you, "Well, how come you're a kangaroo? Prove it." And you say, "Well, I feel like one and I'm hopping around on the goddamned furniture therefore, I'm a kangaroo." Ya, your feeling is part of your cognition. They go together but they, it doesn't prove anything. So, I want evidence not that they're acting badly, because we'll assume they are, not that they're not listening to you when you're right and they're wrong. We'll assume they are, but how that makes you a low, down, lesser person. How does it make you anything? Whatever they do. Well, you're saying that it doesn't but do you really believe that, that they're entitled to whatever they do, even wrong things, but it has no real effect on you unless it's physical attack, but we're assuming there's no physical attack. It has no effect on you unless you make it happen, in effect invent it and say because I'm inefficient with controlling them, which you are, I'm an inefficient person. Now, are you inefficient in controlling anything in your life? 

00:33:45
MOLLY No. 

00:33:50
ALBERT ELLIS So, sometimes you're inefficient, especially with these kind of people, but you're efficient in lots of other things. So, how can you possibly be a totally inefficient person, which you think you are. How? But do you really see that no ma-, suppose you're very, very inefficient and you screw up with these people and you screw up at work, you screw up with friends, etc. Does any of those screw-ups, those ineffectualities make you rotten? 

00:34:25
MOLLY I can't give you proof that they do. 

00:34:25
ALBERT ELLIS No, that's right. You can't be perfect. But can you see that your 'youness', your personality, your essence, your being has millions of aspects, good, bad or indifferent. Sometimes you control people. Sometimes you don't. Sometimes you play tennis well, sometimes you play it badly. But when you screw up in any respect such as controlling these people, that is bad because it's against your interests, but you as a human, as a person, are not effected by that bad act unless you thihnk you are. You see? So, you're tying up 'I must actually control them,' which is really practically impossible, and 'If I don't efficiently control them as I must do, then I, a total person who does millions of things during her lifetime, and we don't even know what you're gonna do in the future, is no damn good.' You see? That's what Korzybski, a philosopher called the 'is of identity.' I behave, I act badly, therefore I am a bad person. Utter crap. Now, do you see that it's really crap? Not that you behave badly, even I behave badly at times. 

00:35:55
MOLLY No way. 

00:36:00
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah, very rarely, but... But am I therefore, suppose I make a serious mistake with you, I help screw you up instead of helping you. Then that would be very bad, but does that make me a rotten person? 

00:36:15
MOLLY No. 

00:36:15
ALBERT ELLIS No. I'm a person who screwed up that time and presumably will learn a little and do better next time. But you see, even if I always screwed up, which is very unlikely, very unlikely, we don't know what I'd do in the future. You see, I could screw up with a thousand clients, in the future I might be the best therapist under the sun. So, you cannot evaluate or measure a person only what she thinks, feels and does and some of your thoughts, feelings and actions are ineffective. You can't control these people. Too damned bad, but you are not your behavior. Now if you really go over that, now say that, that, "Even though I can't control these people, I am not my behavior. Fuck it!" Say that. 

00:37:20
MOLLY Even...I usually don't have a problem saying that word. Even though I can't control these people- 

00:37:25
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:37:25
MOLLY It doesn't make me a bad person. Fuck it. 

00:37:30
ALBERT ELLIS Right. 

00:37:30
MOLLY Okay. 

00:37:30
ALBERT ELLIS Now, how did you feel when you really said that? 

00:37:35
MOLLY I felt like I was repeating what you were saying. 

00:37:40
ALBERT ELLIS Yeah. That's not good. You better believe it, because it effects you, because if you think, 'I have to control people or I'm a lousy person when I don't,' where will that get you? What feelings would you produce if you think that? 

00:37:55
MOLLY Awful feelings. Bad feelings. 

00:37:55
ALBERT ELLIS Anxiety, depression, etc. 

00:38:00
MOLLY Mm-hmm. 

00:38:00
ALBERT ELLIS So, that's not so good. Now, when you take other people's, the lack of controlling them too seriously and you're really upsetting yourself, get anxious and depressed about it, how do you feel about you for being anxious or depressed? How? 

00:38:20
MOLLY I feel badly. I feel upset with, angry with myself. 

00:38:20
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, so you're saying one, "I feel badly about what I did, let others control me and not react well." But then two, you're saying, "I am a rotten person." So, you're putting yourself down for putting yourself down. 

00:38:40
MOLLY Mm-hmm. 

00:38:40
ALBERT ELLIS So, you have a double whammy. 

00:38:45
MOLLY Mm-hmm. 

00:38:45
ALBERT ELLIS So, the thing to do is always accept you but your behavior is stupid. It's idiotic trying to control all the idiots in the world. You're not gonna do it. You see? Even if you're right, you're not gonna do it. So, give up on you, or else you could try to control them but not take it too seriously when you're ineffective. If you wish to control them, that's okay. But you're demanding, "I gotta control! I gotta control or I'm no good." Now, let's give you rational emotive imagery. Close your eyes and imagine the worst, that you're really, really out of control with lots of people, that they're difficult. They're doing the wrong thing. They won't listen to you to do the right thing. And you're really, really out of control and getting more out of control. Can you vividly imagine that? 

00:39:40
MOLLY Mm-hmm. 

00:39:40
ALBERT ELLIS And what's your honest feeling in your gut when you imagine that? 

00:39:45
MOLLY I'm really pissed. 

00:39:45
ALBERT ELLIS You're very angry? 

00:39:50
MOLLY Mm-hmm. 

00:39:50
ALBERT ELLIS Right. Alright. 

00:39:50
MOLLY Angry. 

00:39:50
ALBERT ELLIS Get in touch with that. Get anger, anger, anger. Get furious, enraged, very, very pissed. Get as angry as you can be, really very angry. You're feeling really angry, then change it with your same image, don't change the image. They're doing what they can and doing it rottenly and you're unable to control them and you know you're unable to control them. Make yourself feel very frustrated and annoyed at what you're doing and also what they're doing, but not at yourself, just frustrated and annoyed with what you're doing badly, which you can do 'cause you control your emotional feelings. And tell me when you feel very frustrated and annoyed but not angry at you or even at them. 

00:40:55
MOLLY I feel frustrated. 

00:41:00
ALBERT ELLIS Alright, open your eyes. How did ya get there? How did ya get from rage at yourself and some rage at them to feeling just frustrated at what you and they are doing? How'd ya manage that? 

00:41:10
MOLLY C-, 'cause it's not about me. It's not about m-, my person. I-, it's about the way I'm behaving. 

00:41:15
ALBERT ELLIS That's very good. You see, you saw that it was something about you, some thing but it, not you who could be rated. So, you said that thing is not so good, my being out of control, not controlling them, but I'm okay despite it, right? 

00:41:35
MOLLY Right. 

00:41:35
ALBERT ELLIS Alright. That was excellent. Now, what you do is ya go over that every day for preferably 30 days or so to sink in the change feeling, the healthy negative feeling of frustration and annoyance at their acts and your acts but not at them and at you, and get it automatically. So, every day for the next 30 days, imagine just as we did, the worst. Let yourself feel what you feel. Get in touch with that feeling, especially feelings of putting yourself down and anger, rage at them, putting them down, change it the way you did and several other similar coping statements that can occur to you. "Well, I wish to hell that I weren't so grandiose to think that I have to control people, but it's not the end of the world and I really don't have to think things like that," until you train yourself to feel very frustrated and annoyed with your behavior but never, never, never downing you. Now, will you do that every day for 30 days? 

00:42:45
MOLLY I can. I will. 

00:42:45
ALBERT ELLIS A training process. Alright, just to give you incentive or give you reinforcement, what do you like to do that you do almost every day in the week? 

00:43:00
MOLLY Play with my dogs. Play with my dogs. 

00:43:00
ALBERT ELLIS Play with your dogs. After you do the rational emotive imagery and change your feeling, then you can play all day with your dog. You can do it in the morning, but don't play with your dog until you imagine the worst, let yourself feel upset and then change your feeling to frustration. What do ya hate to do that you normally avoid doing because it's a pain in the ass? 

00:43:30
MOLLY Clean up the dog poop. 

00:43:30
ALBERT ELLIS Clean up dog poop. Right. Well, if midnight arrives or bedtime, whatever your bedtime is and you haven't done the rational emotive imagery that day, you clean up the dog poop for an hour and if it gets too clean, you look for your neighbor's who have dogs and clean up there. Is there anything about this which we may have omitted, something important? 

00:43:55
MOLLY No, I don't think so. 

00:43:55
ALBERT ELLIS Okay. You work on it. 

00:44:00
MOLLY Thank you very much. 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:10
MOLLY Thank you very much. 

00:44:15
ALBERT ELLIS Okay. We have a few minutes left if I can hear any questions, then I'll be glad to answer them. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Dr. Ellis, what do you do with a person who can't see the difference between themselves and their behavior? 

00:44:35
ALBERT ELLIS Can't hear you. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN What do you do with a person who can't see the difference between themselves and their behavior? 

00:44:45
ALBERT ELLIS Will somebody come up here and translate what she said into English so I can hear it? Will one of you? What did she say? 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN What do you do when you can't tell the difference between them and their behavior? 

00:44:55
ALBERT ELLIS Can't what? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Tell the difference between... 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Themselves and their behavior. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Themselves and their behavior. 

00:45:00
ALBERT ELLIS Well, when they, they always can because obviously you are not your behaviors, because if you were your behaviors, then when you did badly you'd always have to do badly, and when you did well, you'd always have to do well. So, we go over it many times and convince them that it's impossible to be your behaviors, because again, if you really do badly, do a lot of things badly, and you say to yourself, "I am a bad person," then ya mean that you can't possibly do good things. You'd only do bad things and in the future, which you can't predict, you'd always do good thing, bad things or good things because you could do it both ways. And it's very disturbed, sick to say, "I am a good person when I do good things," that's grandiosee, and "I am a bad person when I do bad things." So, we go over and over and over with it and show people that it's possible to do that. Now, we have a famous analogy. We say, 'Think of a basket of fruit. It has oranges, apples and bananas in it and some of them are good and some of them are bad. Now, is it a good basket or a bad basket?' And the answer is, you can't give it, as Korzybski said, a global rating. You could rate aspects of it, even the apple, the bananas let us say, some have a bad spot, but the rest of the banana is good. Ya, ya can't do global ratings and yet all humans are biologically prone to over-generalize and do it, and they're taught to do it because your mother and father obviously say most of the time you're a good girl or a bad girl. So, they perpetuate this. The culture does it and ya keep saying it to yourself over and over, but it's obviously errant horseshit and we show people who say that they can't see the difference between themselves, their personality, their being, their essence and their behaviors, we say if you won't see it, you can't see it, go be sick for the rest of your life. Go be anxious and depressed always because the only way you'll not be anxious and depressed is to always do good, effective things. Lots of luck on that! So, we get eventually, but it's hard, practically everybody to say that. Let's have one more question. 

00:48:20
PETER MIGHALI Yes, I'm Peter Mighali (ph). I'm interested in the similarities of different psychotherapy schools. Uh, when I was, uh, uh, watching you, uh, you were doing some imageries and I'm wondering, uh, for me that's, uh, form of hypnotic induction. Uh, if you could comment that. 

00:48:40
ALBERT ELLIS Replay! 

00:48:40
PETER MIGHALI I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. 

00:48:45
ALBERT ELLIS What's the question? Will somebody translate? 

00:48:45
PETER MIGHALI Yeah, the question is to me- 

00:48:50
ALBERT ELLIS I can't hear. Can anybody hear what he said? 

00:48:50
PETER MIGHALI Yes, to me the, uh, imagery is a form of hypnotic induction. 

00:48:55
ALBERT ELLIS I still can't hear. Will somebody please- 

00:49:00
PETER MIGHALI They will translate you. The second question is- 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Are you, do you- 

00:49:05
ALBERT ELLIS Quiet! Quiet so I can hear her. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Do you ever use- 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN He has a hearing problem. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN ...hypnotic induction? 

00:49:15
ALBERT ELLIS Yes, I do use hypnotic suggestion once in a while because it's much, much better when people consciously, without suggestion, hypnosis or anything else, can see that they have irrational, dysfunctional beliefs, see what harm it does and work their ass off to change them, but once in a while, I use hypnotic suggestion and have a pretty famous article on this, which you can find in a couple of the books on hypnosis. 

00:49:50
PETER MIGHALI Did you use it today? 

00:49:50
ALBERT ELLIS Can't hear you. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Did you use it today? 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Hypnosis. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Did you use it today? 

00:49:55
ALBERT ELLIS No, I didn't use it today, of course not. If you think I did, then you have a real problem. A real problem! 

00:50:10
[sil.] 

00:50:10
ALBERT ELLIS There was no hypnosis whatsoever. 

00:50:15
