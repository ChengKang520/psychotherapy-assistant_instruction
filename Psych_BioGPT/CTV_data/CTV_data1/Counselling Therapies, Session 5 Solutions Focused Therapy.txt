00:00:10
UNKNOWN Hi Terry, thanks for coming in today. Hope you found the place all right. 

00:00:20
TERRY Mm-hmm, yeah, no problem at all, clear instructions, so here I am. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN Excellent. 

00:00:25
TERRY Yeah. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN Excellent. Terry I was just wondering if you could tell me a bit about what it is that's brought you in today? 

00:00:30
identifying problem 

00:00:30
TERRY Well, uh, a feeling of, uh, discomfort within the job that I'm doing at the moment. About three months ago, I, I answered, um, a job advertisement that looked like it was going to be something I would really enjoy doing. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:00:50
TERRY And here we are three months down the track and as time's gone on it's just felt less and less comfortable. And I felt like, well I don't know whether I've got the right job. I don't know whether it's the right place for me to be. I mean the place itself is OK, you know the people are great, I really like being there. I really like the people you know and, and, and I don't mind being there, you know, the atmosphere is really good they're very supportive. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:01:15
TERRY Uh, and the work I can do it's not a problem with the work, but it's something, I just feel uncomfortable, really, really uncomfortable. I just thought I can't do this anymore. I can't really put my finger on what it is, why it is. 

00:01:30
effective questioning 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. OK, and I'm wondering why today, Terry, is the right time that you've decided that, you know, after three months, I need to do something about it and that day is today? 

00:01:40
TERRY Yeah, cause last Friday, I felt like running out of the place screaming, absolutely screaming. Uh, it, it just seemed that there was a lot of demands being made on me in a very short time and it just got to me and I thought I can't do this; but it was crazy because I can do it. But, again, there's this confusion, am I in the right place, am I doing something that I really want to do or is this something else and I just got tired of it. And I thought if I don't get out, if I don't do something. If I don't go and talk to somebody then I don't know what might happen, but I found myself being right on the edge, right on the edge. 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. OK. OK. So, Terry I, I'd just like to ask you a bit of a different question. If I can, um, it's going to need to have a bit of a imagination on your part. So will that be all right just to change tack slightly, yeah? 

00:02:30
TERRY Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:02:30
miracle question 

00:02:30
UNKNOWN OK. I want you to use your imagination and I want you to imagine if you can that tonight when you go to sleep, a miracle happens and when you wake up in the morning all your problems are solved. 

00:02:40
TERRY Wow. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN And I'm just wondering how you would know that all your problems were solved. What things would be different? What would have changed? 

00:02:50
TERRY Oh, that'd be great. I, I would feel different because I knew that I, I wouldn't be going to the job that I've been going to for the past three months, that's the first thing. So there'd be that relief of pressure or of feeling uncomfortable. Uh, I would be living in a, somewhere else it would be cooler, not as, not, not, not where I am now. Someplace definitely cooler, um, with my wife, um, in this place as well, this new place. And doing something completely different, something that I would enjoy doing. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:03:35
TERRY And, uh, they're the immediate things. Um, there, they're, that's what comes to mind immediately. That you said, uh, uh, I would feel good, I would feel much more relaxed. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:45
TERRY And much more at peace with, uh, myself, and probably everybody else, including my wife. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN OK, yeah. Terry you mentioned doing something different to the job that you're doing now. Do you have any ideas about what sort of thing you might be doing instead? 

00:04:00
TERRY Oh, yes. Oh, yes. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:04:05
TERRY This is, and I think maybe this is the reason for this discomfort. What I'd really, really like to do five days a week is what I do now one day a week; which is work on radio. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:04:15
TERRY It's, uh, something that I've enjoyed and grew up with and it's been part of my life for a long time. Uh, if given the opportunity, that's what I'd love to do. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:04:25
TERRY I really would. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN What, what sorts of things do you do on the radio? On your program, what does that involve? 

00:04:30
TERRY Uh, I do a lot of interviews, um, local issues, local topics, um, uh, phone interviews, face to face interviews, play a bit of music. But what I really like is talking to local people about local issues and local identities, um, the community sector I do a lot of talking within the community sector and helping them to promote their activities, um, in the local area. So that's what I would really love to do. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Oh, OK. Terry you've created a really, really clear miracle picture. You've talked about, um, a different job, very different from what you're doing now. Being involved in community radio and doing that full-time. 

00:05:10
TERRY Mm-hmm. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Rather than as, uh, part-time, um, maybe even living in a completely different area. 

00:05:15
TERRY Oh, yes. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN To where your living, um, and also still with your wife in the picture. 

00:05:20
TERRY Mm-hmm. Absolutely, yes. 

00:05:20
exception question 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Right. Terry I just have to ask you, um, another, I guess an exception question. I'm just wondering whether there are times when, uh, you've been able to, uh, live somewhere else where you felt a bit more comfortable. Where things haven't been so hot and humid for you, have you ever experienced that? 

00:05:40
TERRY Yeah, um, one of the, one of the challenges at the moment is the heat and the humidity where we're living. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN OK. Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:45
TERRY So, uh, I would imagine and I can see myself living in a much cooler climate and, uh, I, I've had a couple of experiences of that. I've got a brother that lives in Tasmania. 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah 

00:06:00
TERRY And I've been to visit him a few times and that's a very different place to live. 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:06:00
TERRY But probably the most, the, the biggest experience of not having to deal with humidity was, uh, when I lived in Scotland for 10 years. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:06:10
TERRY That was wonderful. 

00:06:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:06:10
TERRY That was absolutely wonderful. So, yes, I've had an experience, I know what it's like and I know that if there's no humidity, it tends to be, uh, colder. But I would rather be in a cooler climate than necessarily a humid climate. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:06:25
TERRY So. 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN What sort of differences did you notice in yourself when you lived in the cooler climate? 

00:06:25
TERRY Um, more energy, or,-- 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Right, more energy, yeah. 

00:06:30
TERRY --or I felt like doing more things. 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:35
TERRY And I didn't feel like I was restricted; because what I've started to do is to tie myself to being, or restrict myself to being in places that are air conditioned or, uh, cooler. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Ah, yeah. 

00:06:45
TERRY So, that sometimes like on the weekend, if it's too hot in the middle of the day there's not the inclination to go out and just to be, just to be part of the outdoors. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:06:50
TERRY Um, so that was different when I was in Scotland, although mind you. When in the middle of winter there that was a different story, you could still go outside but it was a little bit more of a challenge 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:00
TERRY But it was still something that I enjoyed doing. So yes, um, so yeah, being more active. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05
TERRY And being more active and being able to be outdoors more which I enjoy doing 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm, and having a bit more energy? 

00:07:10
TERRY Yeah. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN And would you say perhaps even a bit more social? 

00:07:15
TERRY Um, yeah, uh, yes, but not necessarily; because I can still be if I go to someone else's place or if I meet someone at a coffee shop or a restaurant cause usually, you know, it's usually air conditioned . 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:07:25
TERRY Or I usually pick a place that's air conditioned, but it could be, but it's more just being able to be outside and to move around freely, more freely. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN OK. All right and just feeling a bit more comfortable in yourself, as well. 

00:07:35
TERRY Mm-hmm, yeah. 

00:07:35
scaling question 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Yep. OK, Terry I'd just like to ask a bit of a different question this time. This is a scaling question, where one on the scale is: oh, that's not really me at all, I don't think I could be able to do that and 10 is absolutely, definitely I'm gonna do that, that's me. OK. So, this question is about, how confident you think you would be on the scale from 1 to 10 of being able to achieve some of the parts of your miracle? 

00:08:05
TERRY Oh, on a scale of 1 to 10? 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, on a scale of 1 to 10. 

00:08:15
TERRY Uh, definitely an eight. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN An eight? 

00:08:15
TERRY Yes, absolutely. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:15
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's pretty high, that's pretty high, Terry. 

00:08:20
TERRY Yeah. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. OK. 

00:08:20
TERRY It feels like the impulse is there, so. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Right, OK. And another scaling question as well. This is, um, again, the same: one being a no, definitely, can't really see myself doing that at all to 10 being a yes, absolutely. How willing do you think you are to make an effort towards achieving your miracle? 

00:08:40
TERRY Mm, it, it's probably about the same, but it's more likely a seven rather than an eight. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN OK, that's still pretty high, that's still pretty high on the scale. When you think about when you came in and you were saying, oh, I don't know I'm feeling a bit confused, I'm not sure if I could be in this job, or something's not quite right. To saying, actually I'd like to be on radio, maybe in a different place with my partner and your saying yes I'm motivated and wanting, wanting to do that. That's pretty big, Terry. 

00:09:10
TERRY I, I think it's hearing that, oh, when you're offered the opportunity I'll go yeah, OK. So, yes, I think that's probably why the motivation's there. 

00:09:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, it feels to me like you got a bit of energy about you when you were even thinking about that compared to when you first came in. Just wondering Terry have you got any ideas about how you might be able to take even the next step to move towards making your miracle happen. 

00:09:30
TERRY Um, well definitely talking with my wife, um, because for such a, such a, potentially, such a big move we definitely need to be on the same wavelength and communicating. Um, research, looking at other places in Australia because I think it would be Australia of where we might live that's cooler and definitely doesn't have the humidity. Um, and talking with people perhaps who've lived in other parts of Australia. We've got some friends of ours that have. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:10:05
TERRY And so that might be a possibility as well. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's getting more real. 

00:10:10
TERRY Yeah. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN The more you talk about it. So yeah, OK, you've had your experience overseas and that's helped you understand something about yourself, that now you're saying now I don't want to do that, but what's in Australia. I'm wondering about your brother who lives in Tasmania you mentioned him earlier, might be someone who could be a resource person for you. 

00:10:25
TERRY Oh yes. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN In terms of finding out. 

00:10:30
TERRY He already has. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN He already has? OK. 

00:10:30
TERRY Oh yes. He likes to send little snippets every so often, real estate prices and things like that. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN All right, very helpful 

00:10:40
TERRY Very helpful. Yeah. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Yep, yep, yep. OK, well Terry I'm just wondering do you have, um the feeling as though, uh, enough has been talked about today? To give you a bit of where to go from here and something to do when you, when you leave our session? 

00:10:50
TERRY Yeah, um, it's helped me just really verbalize it out and imagine what you know, in a, in a bigger picture than I thought of, that I, than I had thought of before. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:11:05
TERRY Um, what it might look like. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:11:05
TERRY So, yeah and with, yeah, I can imagine the talking that I need to do. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:11:10
TERRY So, yeah I think I have I've got, I've got, I've got some very positive moves out of the, uh. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN OK. 

00:11:20
TERRY Out of this session. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Excellent, all right well if you'd like to make, uh, another appointment, um, you know in the future or now or whatever I'm sure, you know I'd love to meet with you again and see how you've been going. 

00:11:30
TERRY OK, then, OK. 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:30
TERRY Thank you. 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN Thank you Terry. 

00:11:35
TERRY Thank you.
