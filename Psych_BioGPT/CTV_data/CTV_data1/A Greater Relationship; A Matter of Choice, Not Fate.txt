00:00:50
JON CARLSON We'd like to welcome you to our program, "Living Love". In today's program is having a great relationship, it's a matter of choice, not fate.

JON CARLSON And in our program, we're gonna start out with a quiz , and help our viewers really understand where they fit in the notion of their choices in their relationship. Then we're gonna talk about the seven habits that just wreck a relationship. 

00:01:20
PAT LOVE Deadly habits. 

00:01:20
JON CARLSON The deadly habits that just wreck or destroy a relationship and how you can make choices that are gonna change that pattern. 

00:01:25
PAT LOVE We're also going to look at how our personality affects the relationship. What is it that's unique to me that, that is related to my needs and affect, maybe, the choices I have made in the past, but how I can choose in the future. 

00:01:40
JON CARLSON Make the relationship better. 

00:01:45
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:01:45
JON CARLSON We're gonna talk about a new language, a new way of talking to each other that's gonna help us make better choices. Perhaps something's that really important is we're gonna stop blaming our partners. 

00:02:00
PAT LOVE So, I hope you're gonna tell me what to do instead, right? 

00:02:05
JON CARLSON Well, I think our guests, Bill and Carleen Glasser are gonna tell us what to do. And they're also gonna teach us the solving circle. 

00:02:10
PAT LOVE The solving circle technique. 

00:02:15
JON CARLSON The solving, it's a very important technique. I mean, I can't wait to learn this one.

featuring William Glasser, M.D. Carleen Glasser, M.Ed. 

00:02:20
JON CARLSON Let's start, though, right now with our quiz. 

00:02:40
PAT LOVE We're gonna ask you actually to look at different areas of your relationship and the choices that you've made. So, we'll name an area, and we're gonna ask you simply just to write down one to five. Five meaning that the choices you've made in this area have been very helpful to your relationship. A one would mean, my choices have not been helpful to the relationship. Okay? 

00:03:00
JON CARLSON So, the higher the score, the better the relationship. 

00:03:05
PAT LOVE Okay. 

00:03:05
Choices You Have Made Money: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:03:05
JON CARLSON So, the first one is money. How do your choices about money, how do they affect the relationship? 

00:03:10
Choices You Have Made Sex: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:03:10
PAT LOVE Yeah, savings, spending. Have they been helpful or not helpful? The second area is sex. The choices you have made around sexuality in your relationship. Have they been helpful, very helpful or not very helpful? 

00:03:30
Choices You Have Made Physical Affection: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:03:30
JON CARLSON The next one has to do with physical affection and the choices you make regarding physical affection, from the scale from one to five. 

00:03:40
Choices You Have Made Intimate Talking: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:03:40
PAT LOVE Next, intimate talking, talking personally with your partner. Very helpful, five. Not so helpful, one. Or somewhere in between. 

00:03:55
Choices You Have Made Time with family: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:03:55
JON CARLSON Time with the family on a scale from one to five. Where do you fit? Is the time with the family good for the relationship or does it take away from the relationship. 

00:04:05
Choices You Have Made Time with friends: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:04:05
PAT LOVE Next one is time with friends. The choices you have made around time with friends. One to five. 

00:04:15
Choices You Have Made Work: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:04:15
JON CARLSON The next one may be one of the biggest challenges of today. That's work, and how does one's work either help or deter, to take away from the relationship. One to five. 

00:04:30
Choices You Have Made Listening to your partner: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:04:30
PAT LOVE A lot of choices around that one. The next one is listening to your partner. Listening. One to five. Your choices around listening. 

00:04:40
Choices You Have Made Having fun: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:04:40
JON CARLSON Having fun is the next one. How do your choices about having fun, from one to five. 

00:04:50
Choices You Have Made Having a sense of humor: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:04:50
PAT LOVE Having a sense of humor is the next category. One to five. Are you known for having a good sense of humor or have your choices been positive around having a good sense of humor? 

00:05:00
Choices You Have Made Learning: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:05:00
JON CARLSON And has the humor helped the relationship? The next is learning. Do your choices about learning , do they help or do they hinder the relationship. How you learn, are you a willing learner? 

00:05:15
Choices You Have Made Hobbies/pastimes: 1 2 3 4 5 Not Effective Effective 

00:05:15
PAT LOVE And the last one, hobbies and past times. Oh, here's where golf might come in. All right. One to five. Count your choices around hobbies and past time, have they helped or have they hindered? One to five. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN I really appreciate the choices you have made. 

00:05:35
JULIUS I wish I had brought my wife with me today. 

00:05:40
JON CARLSON We're kind of interested in hearing all of this discussion. 

00:05:45
PAT LOVE Really, we heard a lot of the energy and a lot of laughter. I'd like to hear what, what that was. What was that like? What did you discover? 

00:05:55
JULIUS Well, I had more problems than I thought I should, should have. Maybe we should see a counselor or something. I, I don't know, but I have four problems. Listen to your partner is one. I think I listen acutely. She doesn't think that. She doesn't listen so well according to her. Uh, having fun, I mean, that's me all out. She doesn't care to have fun. Um, sense of humor. I think I have a sense of humor. She doesn't think she has one. And hobbies and pastimes, she doesn't have any, and I think that's all I do is. We need a little work, I think. 

00:06:35
PAT LOVE A match made in heaven. 

00:06:35
JON CARLSON In a, in a moment you're gonna get a chance to look at how you make those choices and maybe making some different ones. 

00:06:40
KIM I found that, um, Cy and I, um, as he said, he has all, like, ones and twos, and I tend to have a lot of fours and fives, so it kind of adds up to a five. 

00:06:50
PAT LOVE There you go. There you go. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN Okay. So you're thinking if you can add your scores together and get fives, it's working? 

00:07:00
CY I can justify all my answers if I take a look at the number one, money. Having a large family, we need money to support all the kids, so I go from a five or a four and five on money to then you get down to work, because I'm always working, I'm scoring real low at that end. Which rolls into not spending a lot of times with friends, not having a lot of hobbies. So, one kind of leads into the other, you know. I score high on one end and low on several other ends. 

00:07:30
PAT LOVE So, it's almost like one low area affects other low areas, pulls the others down. Anyone else, what that was like, taking it or looking at your partner's scores, or it made you think of. 

00:07:40
ARLIS I thought it was, it felt awkward because you were asking the question in relationship to the relationship, and I want to answer from the, from how I felt that the relationship needed those things. 

00:07:55
PAT LOVE Oh, now that might be another way to go back and say, how would you rate this in, in accordance with how much the relationship needs these things. It would be an interesting discussion with your partner. But, maybe if he needs a two and you have a two, hey, we're great. 

00:08:10
JON CARLSON Well, you know what we need to do next? Let's bring out Carleen and William Glasser and learn about choices and maybe how to make different choices. 

00:08:20
PAT LOVE Right. Can't wait to hear them. I know they're very, very good. 

00:08:25
JON CARLSON Well, I'm pretty happy that, uh, Carleen and Bill, you're with us to talk about choices. 

00:08:35
BILL GLASSER We're happy too, because choices are number one on our life right now. We choose everything. 

00:08:40
JON CARLSON You know, there's a friend of mine who said that, uh, that the difference between people who are alive and those who aren't is that those who are alive make choices. And there's so many people who just aren't alive. Why do you think people give up this notion of making choices? 

00:08:55
BILL GLASSER People are scared of choices. That's the whole point. As soon as you say, "I choose." then you're responsible for it. As long as you avoid saying, "I choose", you can get away with it. 

00:09:05
PAT LOVE And yet it's a choice, isn't it? When you think about it. 

00:09:10
BILL GLASSER Everything's a choice. 

00:09:10
PAT LOVE To not choose is a choice. 

00:09:10
BILL GLASSER There's nothing that you do in your life that isn't chosen, except an occasional twitch in your eyeball or something like that. It's all chosen, whether you like it or not. When you're conscience. I'm not saying you choose your dreams, but when you're conscious, you're making choices. And so, why do you want to admit it? I mean, then you gotta take responsibility. Who the hell wants that? 

00:09:30
CARLEEN GLASSER But, the choices we make really affect our lives in a lot of ways. They can hurt us in many ways. They can help us, and I think we're gonna talk about that. 

00:09:45
BILL GLASSER Now, I'm responsible, uh, you know, for saying to her, "You're making lousy choices." I, I recognize she's making choices. I just don't happen to make them myself. That's the only thing. 

00:09:55
JON CARLSON Why do you suppose that couples , you know, they start with such high expectations for relationships, and they really hope that things are gonna work out well. And they make these choices that look like things are gonna work out well, and yet late on they end up settling for something far less. 

00:10:10
BILL GLASSER In the beginning, you wanna say it? 

00:10:15
CARLEEN GLASSER I was just gonna say, the honeymoon is over. That, that's the whole. 

00:10:15
BILL GLASSER In the beginning they got hormones going for them, uh, and hormones, of course, get you together, but unfortunately the hormones don't keep you together. And so, uh, in the beginning they say, "Well, gee, this is great." But, after a while, they begin to listen, "Well, this is what my grandparents taught me. This is what my parents taught me. My parents taught me that life is tough out there." 

00:10:40
PAT LOVE And those choices really don't help us in today's world oftentimes. If I do what my parents did, I'm gonna be in trouble a lot of the time. 

00:10:45
BILL GLASSER What your parents taught you, and you learn from them, not teaching you directly, but you'll watch them. And you'll learn. You saw your grandparents fight. And you saw your parents fight. And you saw your people, aunts and uncles fight. And you saw all these people around you fighting, and you learn from all this fighting. You learn that when I get married, I'm not gonna fight like that , cuz I know that I can do the right thing. And so, going into marriage knowing you're gonna be right is a sure way to end it. You gotta go into marriage kinda saying, I don't think I'm right, but maybe together, she and I, we can figure out what's right for us. And then you got a chance. If I figure out what's right for her, forget it. She figures out what's right for me, forget it. It's kinda an us thing, marriage. People forget that. They forget that they're married. So they can yell and... 

00:11:35
PAT LOVE ...make your own personal choices. 

00:11:35
BILL GLASSER Yeah, they begin yelling and screaming at each other. They forget they're married. You're married to get together, to stay together, to think together, to work together. And it's all choices. If it isn't choices, it's like you've got no marriage. 

00:11:50
PAT LOVE So, in that, you're both world renowned experts, and this is something you've been doing for years and years, and I think you probably have some wisdom for us. Bottom line, what's the biggest problem in relationships, in marriage? 

00:12:00
The Seven Deadly Habits Criticizing Blaming Complaining Nagging Threatening Punishing Bribing 

00:12:00
BILL GLASSER The biggest problem in relation, by far, is I know what's right for her, and she knows what's right for me, and we disagree on that. I walk into the house, and I say, "It isn't right here today." She says, "I worked all day to get it right for the party tonight." I say, "Well, you sure missed out over there." So, I start in with what we call the seven deadly habits. I start in by telling her, "You made a mistake. It's your fault." I blame her. I criticize her. I carp about her. I nag at her. And, you don't have to do that very long. 

00:12:35
CARLEEN GLASSER He doesn't really do those things. He's just making this up. 

00:12:40
BILL GLASSER I've hidden them. You don't see them anymore. 

00:12:40
JON CARLSON Subliminally maybe. 

00:12:40
BILL GLASSER I've waited to be on TV to tell you I do those things. 

00:12:45
CARLEEN GLASSER I think another thing is that people don't listen to one another. I think it's so important that you look into what the other person needs and become aware of what that other person really needs, and then try to do the things that, that will help them get their needs met. 

00:13:05
PAT LOVE Well, do people need different things? 

00:13:05
CARLEEN GLASSER Sure. 

00:13:05
BILL GLASSER Let's get back to what she said. You don't listen to one another, in marriage especially, cuz you know what they're gonna say. They've always said it, and you know what you're gonna say now. So, you soon stop listening to each other. Talk about attention deficit order in the world. The worst attention deficit disorder in the world are husbands and wives. She never listens to me. I never listen to her. The husbands and wives ought to take the Ritalin, then maybe the kids wouldn't need it. 

00:13:30
JON CARLSON So, what do you do if you're in this kind of a relationship and, and it's going downhill, or at least, if, even if you're aware it's going downhill, how do you make better choices? 

00:13:40
BILL GLASSER Well, because you think about the word choice, and you think about the fact that you're married. And then you say to yourself , is what I'm choosing to do, we're having a problem. Is what I'm choosing to do not helping her, not helping me, not blaming her, not blaming me. Is what I'm choosing to do helping our marriage. See, right between us here, there's a marriage. 

00:14:05
JON CARLSON Give me an example, if you can, Bill. What's an example of how that works. 

00:14:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Well, I can give you an example. Well, for money. That was one of the things on the quiz. Well, what if I'm a spender and he's a saver. And I decide that I'm just gonna max out all my credit cards , all our credit cards. And, you know, because I want what I want. And, he of course, wanting to save, he wants what he wants. And the question that Bill asked is that gonna help our marriage? If, if each, each couple, each of the couples, if, if the husband and the wife are both controlling for what they want and what they need in this marriage, then the marriage suffers. 

00:14:45
BILL GLASSER Carleen is my second wife. My first wife died after a very long marriage. And I married Carleen. I learned a lot in my first marriage. And what I learned about money in my first marriage is, she's gonna spend it anyway. And so, why in the world get upset about it. If I encourage her to spend, go to a reasonably good store. Buy things you enjoy. I find out that she spends much less than she would if she's going in there angry at me. By goodness I'll show him. You gotta be real careful about that. She's gonna do it anyway. 

00:15:15
JON CARLSON So, you support that? 

00:15:20
CARLEEN GLASSER He does. 

00:15:20
BILL GLASSER And she's a, she's a sensible person. She's not gonna overspend the money any more than I am. I just make big crazy investments. She makes small sensible ones. That's all. 

00:15:25
PAT LOVE So, looking at the choices that you make in terms of not, not just is it important to me, is it important and helpful to our relationship? 

00:15:35
BILL GLASSER Absolutely. 

00:15:35
PAT LOVE Yes, that makes sense. 

00:15:35
BILL GLASSER The clothes that she buys will soon be gone, but our relationship hopefully is gonna go on forever and ever. 

00:15:40
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:15:40
CARLEEN GLASSER Well , we always say the marriage should take precedence over each of us being right or, or my needs or his needs individually. It's what we both need. 

00:15:50
BILL GLASSER Even when you know you're right? 

00:15:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Even when I know I'm right. Sometimes I, you know, you know you're right, but the marriage, if you really want your marriage to, to be successful and to really work, you, you rethink your thinking a little bit. You think, well, am I going to hurt my marriage by saying this or doing this. You think before you, you talk or act. 

00:16:15
JON CARLSON It almost sounds like you have to talk differently too. 

00:16:15
CARLEEN GLASSER You do. 

00:16:15
JON CARLSON I mean, If there, if the words would be different that you would use. 

00:16:20
CARLEEN GLASSER You learn a new language. It's, it's all based on kind of figuring out a way that will bring you closer together rather than saying the words that are gonna separate you. 

00:16:30
BILL GLASSER You get rid of the I's and you get rid of the you's. The I's are better than the you's. The you's are terrible. You should, you should. That's no good. I will. I will. That's okay. It's not so bad. You know, it's, Tom Gordon used to talk about the I, and that's pretty good if you do it correctly, but the, the, the we messages. What do you think is the best thing? What should we do? Where are we going? What's our best plan, and things like that. Always inclusive. That's right. Not... 

00:17:00
CARLEEN GLASSER And that's because, ultimately, when you help your marriage, you're helping yourself. You know, if my marriage is happier, I'm gonna be happier. 

00:17:10
PAT LOVE Yes, and in many ways, I think we've thought about that backwards. I mean, as I'm listening to you, this is a very simple concept, and it seems like a no brainer, but it does sound in many ways very revolutionary. To think about what's best for the relationship first, before me. We've just come through half a century of the me generation, and so this, in many ways, is a new, an old, new way of thinking. But it sounds like, according to your research, that this is better. It, this is what works. 

00:17:35
CARLEEN GLASSER I think it's the only thing that really can help two people work things out. You know, cuz, it's, it's based on mutual, mutual need fulfillment, both of us getting what we want. 

00:17:50
BILL GLASSER Avoid being right. Being right gives you not only, it gives you the moral fervor when you talk. I mean, I'm right. I gotta teach this woman that's wrong. And she thinks she's just as right as I am, and then the thing just falls apart. 

00:18:05
CARLEEN GLASSER What would be an example? Can you think of an example? 

00:18:10
PAT LOVE I was just thinking, when, when you're, maybe, there are times when your needs are different. Let's just say, we could use the money example or we could use the, uh, sex, for example. Where, where just physiologically if I had to wait until I needed sex, it would be a long time. But I also know my partner really has a different desire level than I do. So, I really do have to think about what is best for the relationship. Is that what you're talk? 

00:18:35
CARLEEN GLASSER I think so too. 

00:18:40
PAT LOVE If you wait, if you just go with your own needs, but what do you, I guess, what do you do with, with differences? How do you work with differences? 

00:18:45
BILL GLASSER Uh, that's a very good question, how you work with differences. You work with differences by saying, "We have a problem." Let's say that it's her mother. She has an older mother, and the mother is really giving her a lot of headaches now. She's a nice woman, and, and, uh, it's affecting our marriage. I mean, she's on the phone with her mother. She has to go over to her mother. She has to bring things to her mother. And then, normally, I could start pouting. I could start acting childish. I could say, it's enough already with your mother. Try a day without your mother. Now, that puts her in a bind, because she loves her mother. She only got one mother. And so, in a marriage of choice, where we really begin to think what to choose, then I would say to her, "Well, Carleen, the best thing I can do for you right now is help you out a little bit with your mother." I know she's not asking for a lot, but I could say, "I'll go with you once a week. I'll give her a call. She never hears from me." What'll it cost me, a 20 second call. And then her mother will say, "Bill called." or something like that. You see, what you're always trying to do, if you're operating the way I believe in, what I've written books about, and all these kinds of things is, you try to do what you can to help the situation because you can only control your own behavior. You can't control anyone else's. And all my little poutings, little bitchings and everything have all been to try to control her. All my childishness and everything else. 

00:20:15
JON CARLSON Well, you know, it makes, makes me even surprised that you have those choices, because I think we're taught so much that to blame and to find fault with the other person and to tell them what to do. 

00:20:25
BILL GLASSER Well, that's the right thing to do. That's what we're taught all the time. This thing happened in Littleton, Colorado. First thing everyone, who's fault was it? We'll never find out who's it is. Never in a million years find out who's fault it is. What they have to say is, "How can we prevent things like this from happening again?" The only way to solve a problem, like I've been talking about with Carleen, is to do things things that prevent it all the way along. Once a problem gets going in marriages, like one of those worms that get into the internet and start erasing things. You can't get it stopped. You've got to start, stop them before they start. And so, I've got to say to her in the beginning when she's upset, what can I do to help her. Not what I can do. She's got enough trouble with her mother without having trouble with me besides. 

00:21:05
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

00:21:05
JON CARLSON This is a whole new perspective, isn't it? 

00:21:10
PAT LOVE It is. It is. 

00:21:10
JON CARLSON in terms of how to look at, uh, relationships. And we started out talking about how people feel stuck and trapped. And as we talked, I'm starting to feel more powerful. 

00:21:15
PAT LOVE Well, I know now, just that paradigm, just that idea of looking at your relationship as a third entity is helpful to me. Because I can, I know what I want or what I need . But to ask the question, what choice would be the best for the relationship. 

00:21:30
BILL GLASSER What does you relationship need? 

00:21:35
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:21:35
BILL GLASSER That's what marriage is all about. 

00:21:35
JON CARLSON Yes. 

00:21:35
CARLEEN GLASSER And the choice Bill is talking about was I would look at the marriage, and I would also look at, okay we have a problem. And then I would say to myself and to say to my partner, "This is what I can do, because the only behavior I can control is my own." This is what I can do that maybe will help the problem and ultimately help our marriage. And in hopes that he, if, if we're a loving couple will look at the same problem and say, "Okay, well, I see what you're doing to try to help the problem. This is what I'll try to do to help the problem." And, and this way both of us, doing what we can do to make it work, you know, that's a commitment. That's a piece of commitment. 

00:22:20
JON CARLSON Yeah, just thinking about coming home and seeing the house a mess, and, you know, thinking you keep house just like your mother and on and on. 

00:22:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Instead of complaining. 

00:22:25
JON CARLSON Could say, yeah, I'll start at the front door and work my way back. 

00:22:30
BILL GLASSER That's another thing that brings this up. Things have got to become less important if you want a happy marriage. Things don't make that much difference. Things can be replaced with a little money. You can live without things. You can't live without the person. And so, she gets upset about things. 

00:22:45
CARLEEN GLASSER I do. 

00:22:45
BILL GLASSER And I just don't care about things, and so, what I do is, Carleen, it's nothing. You know. We had a beautiful crystal. It sits on a shelf. And I know one of these days, and I've warned her about it, but she still wants it, we're gonna have an earthquake, and it's gonna be all gone. That's what happens in California. And so, when an earthquake comes, I'll say, "Carleen, look, they come about every 20 years. Look, we had 18 years without the earthquake, so what the hell?" 

00:23:15
CARLEEN GLASSER 18 years of enjoying the beautiful crystal. 

00:23:15
PAT LOVE The last year you put it on your bed. 

00:23:20
CARLEEN GLASSER But, this has happened to us in our relationship. I would, I thought I lost something very valuable. Well, I actually did. I lost my sunglasses, and they were very expensive because they were prescription. I was distraught. I came home, and I was so upset. And he said, "So, go buy another pair." 

00:23:35
BILL GLASSER Sunglasses. 

00:23:40
CARLEEN GLASSER You know, they're just sunglasses. You know, to get this upset. 

00:23:40
PAT LOVE So, choosing a different way of thinking, and it sounds like also feeling. Because oftentimes I think, well I feel this way. And then I act, never thinking that if I change the way I think, then the feeling will follow. But I can hold a different thought. 

00:23:55
CARLEEN GLASSER That's right. 

00:23:55
PAT LOVE So, holding more of a positive thought about the relationship and what can help the relationship. 

00:24:00
BILL GLASSER Things are transient. They're ambient. They come and go. As long as we're alive, we gotta be with each other. We have a marriage together. We gotta do what we can for the marriage without suggesting the things the other should do. That's the big thing in a, you saw your grandparents do. They're always, grandma's always suggesting, grandpa you gotta do this. And what did grandpa do? In the latter part of their relationship, they hardly talked to each other. And so that's what always happens. My cousin was single for a while, and he used to go, date a little bit. He was married and then he was single. Go to restaurants, and he'd say, kind of a perceptive guy in this certain way. And he'd say, "I used to look around the table and see the married couples and the single couples." Now, how did my cousin know the difference? 

00:24:45
PAT LOVE Married people were not talking to each other. 

00:24:50
BILL GLASSER That's right. That's right. And so. 

00:24:50
JON CARLSON That's a choice though. That's the sad part, isn't it? 

00:24:55
PAT LOVE It is. 

00:24:55
BILL GLASSER Because everything they say they know they're gonna say. They don't come up with anything new or original. When you come with a single person, you wanna get him excited. You wanna get him attracted. You wanna go to bed with him that night. You gotta open your mouth up, correctly. Not to run him down. 

00:25:05
CARLEEN GLASSER You make a choice to do that. 

00:25:10
BILL GLASSER So you gotta pretend when your married that maybe you're single. It's not such a bad idea. 

00:25:15
JON CARLSON Right. 

00:25:15
PAT LOVE Pretend like we're having a good time. 

00:25:15
JON CARLSON Pretend like you're going out for dinner with your lover. 

00:25:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Well, I think it's also, it's the, it's that awareness that we talked about before. Just being aware of the marriage, that third entity. And, I mean, the value of it and whether we cherish this, this thing that we have together, because, you know, if we forget about that and just put it aside and it's all me, me, me, him, him, him, I mean, it, it just, you get lost in that selfness. And I think when, when you really want to be happy, truly happy with another person in a relationship, it's the usness. 

00:25:50
BILL GLASSER And you gotta remember, she's not the same as I am. She's different. She's a woman. I'm a man. She has a different genetic structure. She has a different background. She came from a different religious upbringing. There's a tremendous amount of differences. And, if you start focusing on any of those differences, you start destroying the marriage, cuz she can't help that. That's the way she was. I can't help the way I am, but I can help the way I am right now as I deal with her, and she can choose the way to deal with me regardless of our difference, because you always know, you really always know when you say or do the wrong thing. You have a sensor to that. You can see the person tense up a little bit, withdraw a little bit, get a little bit quiet, have a look of disappointment. All of these things, and so if you're sensitive to that, which we all are, don't do it. So, my theory is that whenever you deal with another person, I don't even care if you don't know them, the best thing to do is to say to yourself, "What I want to do and say with this person, my beloved wife, a stranger , I don't want him to get separated any further from me than the way they are." I don't put my finger up when somebody passes me too close in the car, and things like that. In L.A. where I live, you can get killed for those gestures. Just try to stay close to people. 

00:27:10
CARLEEN GLASSER The body language, you know, the body language I think too. 

00:27:10
BILL GLASSER it doesn't hurt. 

00:27:10
CARLEEN GLASSER That, that couples use with each other. You know, the eyes rolling in the head, and the, you know, the frown you get on your face. But you can, I can tell the minute I say something to Bill if, if, how it sits with him. You can, you can just sense it after you live with somebody. You can't hide it. 

00:27:30
PAT LOVE So, choosing the language of closeness instead of distance. Making choices that all, that really are good for the relationship, not just me, not just for you. Wow. 

00:27:40
JON CARLSON This is exciting, and you know what I think we should do? We should make a choice to get our audience involved and learn some more about how to make choices in real life. 

00:27:50
BILL GLASSER I'm ready. Let's go. 

00:27:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Me too. 

00:27:50
JULIUS So, so, there's no level where you can, um, you don't consider self sacrifice, uh, to sustain a happy marriage or harmonious marriage. 

00:28:00
BILL GLASSER Absolutely. It's like any, what I call, a choice negotiation versus a negotiation with a gun at her head, which is what common negotiations are. I mean, we talk about negotiating, if you don't negotiate, we'll do this or that. But, a negotiation, each party has to give a little and to the extent they can give reasonably equally, it becomes a pretty good. You want a buy a house. The man wants 100,000. You want to pay 80,000. In most cases you kind of compromise at 90,000. That's a very, very sensible negotiation. You each got essentially what you wanted. You each gave a little bit. Sometimes it isn't gonna be in the middle, but if it's got to be somewheres in that 20,000 range or, or it's no marriage. I mean, people want to have a marriage without a marriage, and you can't have a marriage without a marriage. I mean that's just the way it is, that's all. 

00:28:55
JULIUS So, so, for me, it kinda gels, it kinda coagulates in my mind that sacrifice is the key. Uh, you have to sacrifice in order to make the marriage, uh, be what, what, the best that it could be. 

00:29:10
BILL GLASSER You read occasionally of people who sacrifice their life for it, like in the Titanic. These men stayed on the boat. Some were rich enough, they could have got off the boat, but they stayed on. That was a sacrifice. It was for their marriage or whatever it was for. And I thought it was for their marriage or their family or their personal self respect, which had something to do with, at least if their wife the rest of her life would respect them for doing it. So, you, you have to sometimes give it all, and, what, what can you do? I, my wife passed away. She was sick for six months, and it was nothing I could do to keep her alive, but I could be there. 

00:29:50
PAT LOVE I really liked what you said earlier, Carleen, that you got it. It's like you were looking at the big picture that when I do gift or I do please my partner or when I actually am making a choice that pleases him, I also benefit. That's what has helped me in all this is looking at it, just not me or you, but if we choose for the relationship, we both benefit. 

00:30:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Right. Right. So, you're, you're sacrificing, but your sacrificing for your own happiness. 

00:30:20
PAT LOVE Sounds more like an investment . Sacrifice. 

00:30:25
JON CARLSON An investment or a gift. Different word. 

00:30:25
CARLEEN GLASSER It's giving a gift of yourself. 

00:30:30
PAT LOVE An investment in home improvement. Instead of a new garage door. Invest in the relationship. 

00:30:35
DELLA I have a comment and a question if you stick with me long enough. The comment is it's very powerful, the idea of the marriage being a separate entity. Um, because you don't, when you get married you don't see it. I mean, you just get married. It's the action of doing something. You don't view it as a creation of something else that's there. And the idea that that is more important, that each individual's, uh, idea is, is pretty powerful. The question is this though. The, the concern I have is if you're in the habit of just reacting, and this is why we're here obviously, how is it that we, how is it that, because it happens so fast. Confrontation happens really fast, so. 

00:31:20
JON CARLSON Reacting. 

00:31:20
DELLA Right, you react, so how do you get out of that, um, routine . I don't want to say that it's a habit, but how do we get out of that routine and stop long enough to make the right choice. 

00:31:30
BILL GLASSER You can't get out of that routine. 

00:31:30
DELLA And stop long enough to make the right choice instead of just reacting? 

00:31:35
BILL GLASSER I mean, you can't get out of that routine. You're a human being. You have certain little triggers, and they're gonna be pulled. But, then you go back and you say, that wasn't the right thing for me to do or say at that time. I did or said it because I didn't keep my wits about me. Because maybe we all do, but now I see that was the wrong thing to do. It hurt our marriage. It hurt her. It hurt me. And you just say, you know, I'm sorry. I'll try not to do it again. But, you can't ever undo whatever you've done. This is why. 

00:32:10
JON CARLSON So, when you understand this and you catch on, it's helpful to go back and revisit it with a healthier response. 

00:32:15
BILL GLASSER Yeah, don't make a big deal about it. Just say, "Look. I screwed up." 

00:32:20
JON CARLSON The courage to be imperfect and to make a mistake. 

00:32:20
CARLEEN GLASSER And to practice, you practice, I mean, I think if you, becoming aware of it first, that you have this tendency to just blurt things out, and they tend to be very, maybe a controlling kind of thing or a criticism or blaming or something like that. And, and it's hurtful. If you, if you are aware that you do this and you're aware that it's the entity that you're hurting, it puts it in a different perspective, because what you're hurting is yourself then, too. And, and when you know that you're doing something repeatedly that hurts yourself, it's like banging your head on the wall. Well, youwant your head to stop hurting, so you stop banging your head on the wall. You know, and you learn that, gee, this isn't the behavior I want to continue. And it's kind of like a habit that you get into, and when you want to break a habit, you just have to practice, practice not doing it. And, and do something else. 

00:33:15
BILL GLASSER There's a certain faith in the situation, a certain trust in it. So, if, if, for example, she does something, triggers off that I didn't want. And I have faith in her, there's other techniques I can use too, I can just go up, I can give her a hug and say, "Honey, that wasn't you. I can live with it. Don't worry about it." See, very simple kind of a thing that gets rid of it immediately instead of letting it grate and aggravate. Support her in her mistake. So I can live with it . It's no big deal. The world doesn't come to end. The world is never gonna come to an end. 

00:33:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Believe me. 

00:33:50
BILL GLASSER You're gonna be gone, and the world's still gonna be here. 

00:33:55
CARLEEN GLASSER I'm the one with the hair trigger, you know, I come out with the, and he'll do that. Invariably and it so helps. It really does, because I've been in another relationship myself before and whenever I would do that I knew immediately when I did it, it's, darn, I did it. But what would I get in return? Grrr back at me with the same force, and, and there it went again. And, you lose it, after, over a few years, many years, it's gone. The relationship is destroyed. 

00:34:25
BILL GLASSER The, the, the idea of openness and laugh about it, we make mistakes, and these kind of things, people take themselves way too seriously. I know, I'm a psychiatrist, people came, come to my office, and, and they take themselves so seriously, and start telling me all their troubles. And I say, "I don't wanna hear your damn troubles." And they say, "What do you mean?" 

00:34:50
JON CARLSON You're a psychiatrist. 

00:34:50
BILL GLASSER Cuz, I can't do anything about it. They're all over. Even if they happened five minutes ago, it's gone. We can only help what happens now. So, keep living your life now and planning for the future. This idea of going back into the past. Nothing is more destructive. In my field, psychiatry, is in the heart of that destructiveness. I'm trying to explain it is, but it's gonna be hard, cuz Freud went back, so, hell, we all gotta go back. Not me. 

00:35:15
JON CARLSON Well, we don't have to go back in this program, but what we do need to do is go forward. 

00:35:25
PAT LOVE Yes, learn some skills. 

00:35:25
Exercise 1 Choices Are Based on Needs 

00:35:25
JON CARLSON Right? We're gonna move on to the, the, the first activity. And that has to do with learning about needs, and the needs you bring into a marriage. 

00:35:35
JON CARLSON And the strength of the needs. 

00:35:35
JON CARLSON And the strength of the needs. 

00:35:40
BILL GLASSER What I'm gonna explain now, I call the, the basic needs. And this has to do with the way you actually are. We are genetically different people. Some of us have blue eyes, brown eyes, tall, short. Our genes determine what we are, but I believe, and I've been teaching this for years and years and no one has said, stepped forth and said I'm wrong. I believe that we have basic needs built into our genes. They're part of us. And Carleen will go through and kind of explain what they are, but these genes determine a lot about our lives . And that makes us different, because no two people, except for identical twins, are genetically the same. And so an example of this would be that if you saw the movie, "The Rain Man", with Dustin Hoffman playing an autistic. And he went to Las Vegas with his brother, and in Las Vegas a prostitute tried to pick him up. And Dustin Hoffman didn't have any idea what she was trying to do because he was autistic, which means that his needs for love and belonging were just practically absent. He didn't feel the need to reach out to anyone, including the opposite sex. So, if you marry someone who has a very low need for love and belonging, you have a high need, you're gonna be genetically incompatible. We'll talk about that more with regards to all the needs, but this is part of you that you can't change. So when you find you have a difference, you have to understand that difference, which certainly would help. And then negotiate it to try to work out the best way to reconcile that difference within your marriage. Now, Carleen will go ahead and, and explain the needs themselves. 

00:37:25
The Basic Needs in a Relationship Survival Hormonal Risk Takin gMoney Matters Security Safety 

00:37:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, um, we're gonna do a little activity now that I'd like you to do at home. Uh, we're going to look at each one of the basic needs. One of them, the need for survival, is the first need we're gonna talk about. And that need is basically when we're talking about every day life, it's not just, uh, being able to, you know, maintain yourself physically, you know, food and shelter and all of that. It's also, you know, are you a, an ant or a grasshopper. Are you a saver or a spender. Are you overly concerned about your health and, and eat health food and things like that. Are you, um, worried about, uh, taking a risks . Are you a risk taker or not a risk taker. What I'd like you to do is think of an example of the type of person that you are, just by nature, in, in the area of survival. Just me using these examples, but give me an example of how you are and, and kind of jot it down . Write a note about that in the space that's provided on the paper that I've gotten to the audience here. Um, and then think about the need for survival. And we're gonna think about all of the needs as I list them, and figure out for yourself whether you are a high survival need person or a low survival need person. Are you, uh, if you're a high survival person, then give yourself a five. If you're low, give yourself a one. So, on a continuum of one to five, you're either low at the one end or five at the high end or somewhere in between in the need for survival. Uh, the next need is beloningg. 

00:39:10
BILL GLASSER For example, for example if you're a man that always wears a belt and suspenders, give yourself a five.

The Basic Needs in a Relationship Fun Laughter Learning Activities Hobbies Amusements Games Sense of Humor 

00:39:15
CARLEEN GLASSER The, the next need, the next four needs, there are four more needs. The next four needs are the psychological needs that we all have inherent in ourselves. They, the first one that is a psychological need would be the need for love and belonging. So, in love and belonging, it's not just, oh, I need a lot of love. You know, everybody needs love. We all think we need love except perhaps the autistic who is genetically not able to have that need. But, it's, it's not just the need for love from other people, it's how much do I need to give love to other people. My, my sense of giving and my, my need to reach out and connect with other people. The need for power is the next need. And, in that need basically we get our needs met for power by having someone listen to us. How, how much do I really desire or want to have someone be there and listen to me. Um, it also includes achievement, you know, and, and making it work, becoming a success. Um, it basically also means how much do I need to have the last word. How much do I need to control the other people in my lives. You know, do I need to be the boss here. And, on a, on a continuum of one to five, you're gonna rate yourself on the need for power. The need for freedom, that seems pretty self-explanatory, but freedom is just freedom from people. Do I need to get away? How much time do I need to myself, my own space? Something like that. Uh, my mobility, moving from job to job . Things like that. Uh, and the need, the last need then is the need for fun. Fun is our genetic reward for learning. Am I a person who's always seeking out new ways to learn? What kind of hobbies do I have? Do I have a great sense of humor? Or, you know, do I value work more than play? Or do I value play more than work? On a continuum of one to five, where are you in the fun need? 

00:41:25
BILL GLASSER If you go into a school and you ask kids generally, who's a great teacher in the school? They'll say, "Well, Mr. Jones. He's a great teacher." You'll say, "Why?" Invariably, I've done this hundreds of times, they'll say "He makes learning fun." And that's why these things are so related. Anyway, now, when you've done this. Do it individually, and then compare with each other and see how your needs each one compares in terms of the strengths . The wife is a two on survival The husband's a four. And each ones, and do that and then note where there are differences. So, in a later part of this same exercise, when I go around and Carleen goes around , we can help you understand that comparison and learn how to negotiate it. So, go ahead and do that now, and I think we'll then, soon as you have it done, there's not rush, we'll go back and, and finish the exercise where I think you'll learn a great deal. 

00:42:25
Please Pause Here & Write 

00:42:25
BILL GLASSER Okay, by now I'm sure you've turned off your TV and gone through this form, which was in your packet, and rated, uh, the husband and wife each have a need profile. Now, the comparison is what's crucial. If you didn't rate yourself exactly right, don't worry about it. You're, you're close enough. It's the comparison that we're really looking at. So, a, now, now you're looking for genetic compatibilities, genetic. So, let's say you, uh, one person rated themselves one on survival, the other five. This is highly incompatible. This is the ant married to the grasshopper. It's just not going to work, and so I doubt if this has happened, but if it happened, it can still be negotiated. It's, everything can be negotiated, but now at least you'll know what to negotiate. You'll be, because you might be fighting about everything when all the other needs are perfectly compatible. The only one that's incompatible is survival. But like anything else in life, you focus on what the problem is, not what the successes are. And so it's very important to realize, you may have a marvelous marriage, but on survival you've got some differences. Maybe some big differences. But it's, it's negotiable. With love and belonging, these should be relatively the same, both high love people marry high love will be good. High love people marry four, three love people is all right. Now, in power, it's quite different. What happens if two high power people marry each other? Well, they're gonna kill each other eventually. I mean neither one's gonna give in. And so, this is a very, very difficult thing to do. They may not kill each other, but it's gonna have big problems. Better if a real high power person marries a low power person who doesn't care that much about power. If you're too low together, that's marvelous. I mean, nothing better than a low power couple marrying a low power couple. That's like a marriage made in heaven. Now, on freedom, two high freedom people marry each other. No problem at all, because the marriage isn't gonna last more than a few weeks. I mean, there's nothing, nothing in a, a marriage that a high freedom need of both parties can survive. It's best for marriage if high freedom people, it's really best if high freedom people hardly go even get married. But if they do, they have to realize they have to give up, they have to give up in the marriage, they have to give up some of this freedom or they can't stay married. There's no sense, I, I have a freedom need. My, my first wife didn't have a high freedom need. We negotiated. She said, "I can live with so many nights a month that you're gone speaking", which is what I do. And so we negotiated five nights a month. Didn't hold to it all the time, but pretty much our arguments pretty much ceased. I sometimes said, "Well, I'm saving up an eight speech month, but I'll only have a three speech month this month." And so, we kind of negotiated, and it worked out pretty well, because she understood that's what I did, but it couldn't be 20 nights a month. That, that wouldn't work out under any circumstances So, uh, freedom, you kinda gotta negotiate. Fun, don't worry about it. Fun, it's better if you're both fun. You'll have a lot of laughs. If you don't have both fun, one of you'll have a lot of laughs. It's not, it's not gonna hurt your marriage one way or another. Hopefully you'll have a little fun and laugh together, but fun is not gonna destroy the marriage or anything like that. It's just better if you both have a reasonably high need for fun. Now what we're gonna do now, Carleen, I'm gonna walk over here to where Carleen is. I'm not Donahue now, the camera will follow me. I don't have the white hair, but it's getting close. And so. 

00:46:05
CARLEEN GLASSER I do. I make up for it. 

00:46:05
BILL GLASSER Well, gee, yeah, she has the Donahue hair . And so, we'll look at, at the couple here. 

00:46:10
Survival Belonging Power Freedom Fun Kim 4 5 3 3 3 Cy 4-5 2 5 4 2 

00:46:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Kim and Cy. 

00:46:10
BILL GLASSER Yeah, and, and their their need for survival is both high. No problem there. Their need for, what do you see there, Carleen? 

00:46:20
CARLEEN GLASSER Love and belonging, Kim has a five. And Cy has a two. 

00:46:25
BILL GLASSER Yeah, there's gonna be some places they have to negotiate there. He's gotta scratch up a little more and run his genes right to the core, maybe even move it up to a two and a half, and she has to say, "I got Cy, for better for worse, for richer for poorer. What the hell. I'll live with him the way he is. That's the way it is." But, if she expects too much, Cy can't give it. It's not there. Now, this might not be accurate. Cy might be a closet five, let's hope he is. And so, here we have, what's you see in that next one? 

00:46:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Uh, Kim has a three in power, and Cy has a five in power. 

00:47:00
BILL GLASSER That, that looks real good, real good. Yeah, that's a, that, freedom. 

00:47:05
CARLEEN GLASSER Freedom is a three for Kim and a four for Cy. 

00:47:10
BILL GLASSER No problem. No problem. That's okay. 

00:47:10
CARLEEN GLASSER That's close enough to average. 

00:47:15
BILL GLASSER Fun, they'll have a few laughs in the marriage. We won't say what it is. They'll be okay. 

00:47:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Three and a two. They're in good shape. 

00:47:15
BILL GLASSER Yeah , you're okay. Just a little bit here you can concern yourself. Now what do we got next door here? 

00:47:20

00:47:25
BILL GLASSER Okay. 

00:47:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Arlis is a five in survival, and Julius is a three. 

00:47:30
BILL GLASSER Yeah, when a woman is higher than the man, usually works out pretty well. Cuz when the man makes mistakes, he makes big ones, and so, this is, this works out pretty well. And, the three. 

00:47:40
CARLEEN GLASSER The three and the five for belonging 

00:47:45
BILL GLASSER Five, that's, yeah. That's, that works out pretty well too. You're only, when you're two points apart, it's no big deal. And, power, four and four. 

00:47:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Power four and four is equal. 

00:47:55
BILL GLASSER Well, you may snarl at each other once in a while, you know growl, that kind of thing. 

00:47:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, four is higher than average. 

00:48:00
BILL GLASSER Before you fight, put a muzzle on. That's the main thing. 

00:48:00
CARLEEN GLASSER But, the, the power need being equal was, is where probably if your marriage is gonna have any, any conflict at all, it's gonna be in your need for power. 

00:48:10
BILL GLASSER Except, here's another thing. When, if you join on a project, it's really good both to have a high power. That's how my wife and I, my first wife had a power need , and I did. We worked together in my institute and it really worked out well. 

00:48:25
CARLEEN GLASSER And Bill and I do that too. 

00:48:25
BILL GLASSER And we do that too. 

00:48:30
CARLEEN GLASSER I mean, he'll, he, he, you know, you, you do that? 

00:48:30
JULIUS Yeah. 

00:48:30
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, good. 

00:48:30
BILL GLASSER So that, so that's good then . But, it's when you work against each other here that it's bad. Now here you have. 

00:48:35
CARLEEN GLASSER The freedom is four and four. 

00:48:40
BILL GLASSER Four and four. It's again, it's like you gotta realize that you're gonna have a little urge to move around a little bit, and you just have to live with it. And, and here you got... 

00:48:50
CARLEEN GLASSER A two and a five. 

00:48:50
BILL GLASSER Arlis is a two for fun. Julius will just have to tell a hell of a lot of jokes, and she'll probably laugh at them. Okay, you'll be alright. Let's go on to the next people here. What do we got? 

00:49:00
Survival Belonging Power Freedom Fun Connie 3 5 4 3 4 Hank 3 5 3 5++ 4 

00:49:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, Connie and Hank. Connie is a three in survival. And Hank is a a three. This is wonderful. You're both average survival needs. Neither one of you is, uh, overly in one direction or the other. 

00:49:15
BILL GLASSER You've got small balls of string in the closet and that's all you need. Okay. 

00:49:15
CARLEEN GLASSER They're both high in belonging. Both have fives in love and belonging. And that is, that's ideal. That's excellent. 

00:49:25
BILL GLASSER And that's excellent because they're coming up with a little power. Power, they're pretty okay in power. 

00:49:30
CARLEEN GLASSER Uh, Connie is a four and Hank is a three, which, you know, is pretty close. I mean, average in power and that's not... 

00:49:35
BILL GLASSER You're not a power freak. Just high. There's a difference, and that's okay. 

00:49:40
CARLEEN GLASSER What do you mean by, what did you pick, put down as your example for power? 

00:49:45
CONNIE Power? I do like to direct things hoping to influence according to the importances, cuz I like to be listened to and understood. 

00:49:50
CARLEEN GLASSER You like to be listened to and understood. Okay, so, so you don't, it's not necessarily that you want to control somebody else. 

00:50:00
CONNIE Right, right. 

00:50:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay. 

00:50:00
BILL GLASSER You see, and, and obviously people who are trying to do this at home, you should look at what you wrote down and find out that even though it may seem incompatible, there may be a lot of compatibilities there. We're just judging the numbers themselves. 

00:50:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Right. What we're, what we're going to do at home, what we'd like you to do at home and what we'd like you to do when you all get home, is talk this over. The whole purpose of this activity is the conversation, the communication that results from it. 

00:50:25
BILL GLASSER And, and, and finding the parts where there's problems. And don't argue about the whole marriage. Just focus on where there's a problem, cuz four out of five, and the only problem here is a real high freedom need. And, and only a moderate freedom need. But, what balances is this high love need. If you've got enough love, you can really get away with almost anything. And so, this is, this is livable. Well, here we got fun, and this is a couple that's gonna have a lot of laughs, you know. 

00:50:55
CARLEEN GLASSER And learn together. 

00:50:55
BILL GLASSER Their kids are gonna say, you know, how come you're so happy all the time, you know? 

00:51:00
CARLEEN GLASSER You laugh so much. Okay, very good. 

00:51:05
BILL GLASSER Okay, great. 

00:51:05
Survival Belonging Power Freedom Fun Mary Kay 4 5 3 3 3 John 5 3 4 5 2 

00:51:05
CARLEEN GLASSER All righty. And here we have, uh, Mary Kay and John. Mary Kay has a four survival need and John has a five. He's the, he's the saver. But, she's not that much of a spender, so she , they're they're pretty compatible there. 

00:51:20
BILL GLASSER Yeah, survival is fine. You, you got a little money in the bank, or you should have eventually. 

00:51:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, yeah, they're gonna be pretty secure. That's fine. Yeah, and the love and belonging, Mary Kay has a five, love and belonging, and John has a three , an average need for love and belonging. And that, that's also quite compatible. And you'll understand that she needs a lot of affection. She needs a lot of, okay. And, and you'll understand that sometimes he's gonna be busy. 

00:51:45
BILL GLASSER Break your heart and give it to her. What the hell, you know. 

00:51:50
JOHN I trust her with it. 

00:51:50
CARLEEN GLASSER And then the power need, Mary Kay has a three, and John has a four, so, um, the lower need, or the average need for power in Mary Kay will balance out that, that a little bit above average need of power, uh, I don't see that that would be a, a bone of contention. Possibly the bone of contention in your marriage might be the freedom need. Is that correct? 

00:52:15
BILL GLASSER Yeah, a little bit bone there. You've gotta be. 

00:52:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Because Mary Kay has a three. She's an average need for freedom. But John is a five, and he, he needs a lot of, uh. 

00:52:20
BILL GLASSER You've got to give her a little more love here to get away with that five. 

00:52:25
JOHN I think that's, I think that's what's been working. 

00:52:30
BILL GLASSER Okay. 

00:52:30
CARLEEN GLASSER It's been working? 

00:52:30
MARY KAY Yeah. 

00:52:30
CARLEEN GLASSER That's happened in your marriage. Good, good. 

00:52:30
BILL GLASSER And the two and the three on fun, you won't have as many laughs as the couple next door, but you'll be okay. 

00:52:35
JOHN We'll have to visit them. 

00:52:40
BILL GLASSER Introduce yourselves. All right. Let's go on to the next one here. What do we got going here? 

00:52:45
Survival Belonging Power Freedom Fun Bret 4 4 4 3 4 Della 4 5 5 3 4 

00:52:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, Della and Bret. Della has a survival need of four, and Bret is a four plus. 

00:52:50
BILL GLASSER We don't go four plus. 

00:52:50
BRET She goes, what no five, so I said okay, I'll make it four plus. They're all originally fours. 

00:53:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, well that's wonderful that you both have the same need for survival, because you both, uh, are concerned about saving and your, and your health. And you can support each other, and you don't have any misunderstandings probably in there. 

00:53:15
BILL GLASSER In the love is fine, five and four. 

00:53:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, five and four is great. 

00:53:15
BILL GLASSER This is a little problem here. Uh, you have to work together. If you have high power and you work together, you know, you decide you're gonna remodel the kitchen, you both work at it, you'll get a hell of a job done and you'll enjoy it. 

00:53:30
CARLEEN GLASSER Let me ask you this. In this need for power, do you find that, that because Della you're a five, and Bret your a four, do you, do you sense that that might be a place in your marriage where you would have maybe the most problems? Is that? 

00:53:40
DELLA We might at times. Yeah. 

00:53:45
BILL GLASSER I mean, that, that's like the problem area, if it's gonna have an area. 

00:53:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Cuz look at three for freedom, they both have free. 

00:53:50
BILL GLASSER That's perfect, yeah. 

00:53:50
CARLEEN GLASSER That's perfect. 

00:53:55
BILL GLASSER That could, when the, when the freedoms are low, that's really good. I mean, that's, high freedom, you gotta work at it. 

00:54:00
CARLEEN GLASSER And the fun need, they have a four and a five. And that, they're gonna have a lot of laughs. They're gonna do a lot of learning together. 

00:54:05
BILL GLASSER My advice is hang together. It looks pretty good. 

00:54:10
Survival Belonging Power Freedom Fun Frank 2 4 4 5 5 Beverly 3 4 4 5 4 

00:54:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, pretty good. And here we have , uh, Frank and Bev. Frank is a two survival, Bev is a three. So, they both like to spend money. 

00:54:20
BILL GLASSER Well, maybe not money, but, you know, whatever. 

00:54:20
CARLEEN GLASSER Or, they, they like to take risks. 

00:54:25
BILL GLASSER Take a few risks. 

00:54:25
FRANK Yeah, we do like to take risks. 

00:54:25
BILL GLASSER Yeah, this is a river rafting couple They get out on the river. 

00:54:30
CARLEEN GLASSER Or, or sky diving or something. 

00:54:30
BILL GLASSER Skydiving. 

00:54:30
FRANK No, we haven't done that. 

00:54:35
BILL GLASSER Well, you know, you can work on that one. 

00:54:35
CARLEEN GLASSER The love and belonging need, both above average. Both are fours. This is, this is beautiful. This is very, very good , uh, relationship problem, no relationships problems in this area. Now, in the power, they both have a, a, a four. Can you explain those fours a little bit to us? 

00:54:55
BEV Uh, what was my four? Mainly just achievement and accomplishment in my life. That's more of it than anything, really. 

00:55:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Rather than bossing 

00:55:00
BILL GLASSER Not much bossing around. 

00:55:05
BEV It's not control, no. 

00:55:05
BILL GLASSER If it's power, do you respect each other for achieving a lot together? 

00:55:10
BEV It's a couple of them, really. 

00:55:10
BILL GLASSER Yeah, okay. 

00:55:10
CARLEEN GLASSER And then in their, in their freedom... 

00:55:15
BILL GLASSER This is probably, this is power, probably a little bit overestimated here, cuz when you get above three, you're trying to boss each other. See, you might have overestimated a little. As long, it's fine. Freedom here, the fives, this would worry me. So, I don't know what to say. Five, fives, you know. 

00:55:30
CARLEEN GLASSER But, they do everything together. I was talking to them earlier. 

00:55:35
BEV We have no kids. 

00:55:35
FRANK We do, yeah, you can tell we don't have children. And in fact, when we had the. 

00:55:40
CARLEEN GLASSER So, you mean freedom together as opposed to freedom apart from each other. So, they have a high freedom need to get out doing things with each other. 

00:55:50
BILL GLASSER Yeah, well, that's okay. Just understand youv'e got a high freedom need, and you gotta be careful if you run into a problem that that doesn't, you have to understand that that could be a source that you should be careful of, that's all. It's, it's not a bad thing. You just have to be careful. 

00:56:05
CARLEEN GLASSER And, they have a huge. 

00:56:05
BILL GLASSER That's another laugh a million couple. 

00:56:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, five and a four on, on the fun. 

00:56:10
BILL GLASSER When you have kids , that'll calm you down. 

00:56:15
CARLEEN GLASSER They're having a lot of fun now. But, but they also told me, what, what do you do together? 

00:56:20
FRANK Everything. 

00:56:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Everything, but you go, you have your classes together, and you're pursuing the same courses. 

00:56:30
BILL GLASSER You go to school together? 

00:56:30
FRANK Yes. 

00:56:30
CARLEEN GLASSER They're learning together and doing all kinds of neat things together. 

00:56:30
BEV A lot, a lot of the same interests. We're both kind of creative people. He's a writer. I'm an arty, you know, so that's the freedom. 

00:56:40
CARLEEN GLASSER A lot of compatibilities. I, I think that what we've seen here is, um, a lot of compatibility, genetic compatibility. And you wonder, gee how did we get together and get married? And, many times it's because you were genetically compatible with each other. And, and if you've ever been married be, before, you probably, you realize that there were some incompatibilities that you had with, with your previous mate . And, or if you were going with somebody, that it didn't work out before you married the person you married. And something about you told you that this other person isn't right for me. And, this tool of looking at your genetic needs strengths, is just, that's just what it is. It's a tool for you to use to look at where you're most compatible and celebrate that, and where you're not as compatible and look at ways that you can give to the relationship based on what your partner needs. That's the important thing. 

00:57:40
BILL GLASSER And, in most cases, it was only in one of the five needs that you showed an incompatibility was there. So, four fifths of your marriage is genetically compatible, and that's very good. This is the place where you may have a little trouble, so you're warned about it. But the whole marriage isn't over or anything like that. That's why when people don't understand this, then when they have trouble, they think it's the whole marriage, and it isn't. Look at, look at the donut, not the hole, the pluses not the minuses. And that's really the thing to do. So, this is a little exercise that, and you can repeat this periodically just for the fun of it. 

00:58:15
Exercise 2 Choosing the Language of Closeness 

00:58:15
The Seven Deadly Habits Criticizing Blaming Complaining Nagging Threatening Puhishing Bribing 

00:58:15
BILL GLASSER I think by now you've probably realized that the real problem in relationships is one party or the other party or perhaps both parties trying to control each other. And so what I've done in, in my work with people trying to get along with each other is work out what I call the seven deadly habits that kill or harm relationships. Criticizing. There's nothing worse than criticizing . No one ever walks away from a criticized position and says, oh thank you. I appreciate, so much, your correcting me and straightening me out and putting me on the path of righteousness. I just didn't know the right way. Nobody. They go away angry. They roll their eyes and everything else. Who needs this. Constructive criticism is an oxymoron. It just doesn't go together. And so, if you can get rid of that one, good . Now, the next one is blaming. Blaming is not good either, but it's not as bad as criticism. It's finding out whose fault it is. When you find out whose fault it is, because sometimes it is someone's fault, what you know is whose fault it is. It tends to destroy the relationships because now you've pointed out it's my fault, and I don't like it. And so, try to get rid of blaming. And the third one is complaining. Complaining isn't so bad, really. It just gets to be a drag . I mean, it's not that people are complaining about you, necessarily , but if you're hooked up with a complainer, and every place they go, he says, she says , complaint, complaint, complaint. You don't go through the day without nothing's right to a complainer . It gets to be so you get, I don't, I can't stand another word of it. And so, that's pretty bad. The fourth one is nagging. Nagging is, well, everyone knows what nagging is . I mean, nagging is like, after you've told someone several hundred times something, just take for granted that they have head what you said, and they don't want to do it. And nagging isn't going to get them to do it. In fact , nagging solidifies their position against you. But, it's certainly a very common thing. And then there's threatening, finger pointing and the threatening. And then punishing, which couples do in a whole variety of ways. You know the ways as well as anyone. There's all kinds of ways to punish your partner. And then, finally, what we call, uh, rewarding to control or bribing. And neither of these really work very well. I mean, if you do this, we'll go shopping etc. None of these things work at all. So, if you can get rid of, if you can get rid of the whole seven deadly habits, then you've got the greatest relationship in America. If you can get rid of any one of them, it will certainly help. So, these are the relationships. Now, I think we got a volunteer here. Hank is gonna help us out here, and he evidently has something. Carleen's gonna go over, and maybe you can come up here and sit here. Give your chair to Carleen for a moment or so . Let's see what happens here. 

01:01:05
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, Hank is, Hank has agreed to do a little demonstration roll play with me to, uh, to show how we tend to use these seven deadly habits. And so, okay, I'm gonna be the wife, and you're gonna be the husband. And, and I'm kinda gonna say, Hank, um, you know, I've been meaning to tell you something that's been kinda bugging me. Um, you know, the toothpaste tube , I like it squeezed from the bottom all the way up, and I notice that every time I get a new tube, you squeeze it right in the middle. I mean, it really gets on my nerves, and I, I just don't like it, and I mean, and another thing, you know when you put your socks in the wash? I want. I would really like it if you would turn them inside out, I mean, like, leave them inside out. You don't, and then you just throw them in the wash. Then, then I have to turn them right side out when I fold them to put them in your drawer. 

01:02:05
HANK Well, when I grab the toothpaste, it just, you know, I grab it in the middle, and I'm in a hurry. I gotta, I mean, I'm just in a hurry. And I'm not trying to bug you, I just grab it in the middle, and that's what I do. Socks, you know, that's how they come off, and I'm just glad to get them in the hamper. 

01:02:20
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, but, like , it's, it's really getting on my nerves. I mean, you do this all the time. I don't know what to do with you. I mean. 

01:02:30
HANK I thought I was doing pretty well, brushing my teeth and getting the socks in the hamper. 

01:02:35
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, but, you know, this is not, you're a grownup now. I'm not your mother. I shouldn't be telling you this stuff. 

01:02:45
HANK I didn't wanna marry my mother. 

01:02:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Well, you didn't. So, your mother doesn't live here, so she's not gonna clean up after you. You leave your messes laying on the floor and stuff like that, and I, I'm just sick of it. And I, I, you know, we've only been married a short time, but I just, you know, it's killing a lot of the feelings that I have for you. I mean, and I don't think that I do anything like that. 

01:03:05
HANK Well, you know, when I come in, uh, after work, I almost kill myself coming in the door on shoes that are left scattered in the middle of the hallway there. I almost turn my ankle just trying to get into the, into the doorway. I wasn't happy about that. And, you know, there's a place for the shoes, but somehow they're kicked off right at the door, and I come through. And if the light's not on, I well could fall down and turn an ankle or worse. So, and you know. 

01:03:35
CARLEEN GLASSER Well, I would pick up my shoes if you would clean up your messes, but you just don't do it. 

01:03:40
BILL GLASSER Okay, that's real good. I think we've gotten the idea real well. So, what we want to do is, is carry on. Now if people haven't caught on that there's some little problem here, then they have, they shouldn't be watching this tape in the first place . So, okay, Carleen wants to give you some instructions. 

01:03:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, okay, at home, what I'd like for you to do is take a look at this list of the seven deadly habits, and for each one of the habits that you see, the criticizing, blaming , complaining, and so forth, if you will write down some of the actual language that you use when you criticize your partner, and see how, how that looks to you. Even work together to do this and remind each other. I mean, I don't want to start a big argument all over again, I mean, but just become aware of the actual language and ask yourself if the language that you're using, after you read this, is , is bringing you closer together or if it's actually the deadly habit. 

01:04:40
BILL GLASSER And then sign a pledge never to do it again as long as you live. 

01:04:45
CARLEEN GLASSER But, we're also gonna look at, we're going to, to look at what you said. We're gonna look at what the audience here has said when they write, do this same activity. And, and then we're gonna talk about what to do instead, some alternative language. 

01:05:00
Please Pause Here & Write 

01:05:00
CARLEEN GLASSER I'm wondering if you would be willing to share with our listening audience and viewing audience some of the things that you've written down, that, that you actually, some of the language you actually use with one another in your marriages. So, who would like to start? 

01:05:20
CY I wouldn't mind starting. Uh, Kim, why is the garage door open? None of the kids are outside playing around. Can't you keep track of what the kids are doing out there? We've got a lot of expensive tools and equipment in the garage. I wish you'd keep the garage door shut when there's nobody out there keeping an eye on these things. 

01:05:40
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay. 

01:05:40
CY And it goes from there. 

01:05:40
BILL GLASSER Which one is that one? 

01:05:40
UNKNOWN Complaining. 

01:05:40
BILL GLASSER Complaining, but also what? 

01:05:45
UNKNOWN Criticism. 

01:05:45
BILL GLASSER Criticizing. 

01:05:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Criticizing. 

01:05:45
KIM Hes' real good at that one. Lots of practice. 

01:05:50
BILL GLASSER Anybody? 

01:05:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Let's hear Kim first. 

01:05:55
KIM And, I guess I tend to do a lot of complaining, and an example might be like, you Cy, you know, I'm tired of all the family activities always between me and the kids. How come you can't get more involved? And I still feel like I'm a single mom with all these kids. I'd like to do things with you too. 

01:06:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, so that's a complaining kind of thing that you do periodically or often? 

01:06:20
CY All the time. 

01:06:20
KIM Periodically. When he's around to hear it. 

01:06:20
CARLEEN GLASSER All right. Okay. Who else would like to share something that they've written? 

01:06:25
BRET My wife will ask me to do something, and uh, or get her something. I'll always try to, uh, ask her if I can get something in return. So, I'll try to bribe her. 

01:06:40
CARLEEN GLASSER Oh, bribing. If you do this, I'll do that. That kind of thing . Can you give us a specific example? 

01:06:45
BRET Well , it's, this is PG, this is, uh, this is PG. Um , no, but I can give you another example of, um, can I pass on that? 

01:07:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Yeah, sure. I think we have an embarrassed wife who maybe isn't ready to do a rebuttal yet. 

01:07:05
UNKNOWN I'm sure you can think of a few , though, huh, 

01:07:10
BRET She's got a couple down. 

01:07:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Is that right, Della? 

01:07:10
DELLA Oh yeah, I've got a couple down. 

01:07:15
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, go for it. 

01:07:15
DELLA Um, I tend to nag, I guess. It might even be sort of criticism, but I see it as nagging. If he's sitting watching TV and I'm doing things, and I know something needs to be done, I'll say to him, "Couldn't you be putting clothes in the wash or putting, putting a diaper on the baby or washing the dishes." You know, it applies in many situations, but I say that, couldn't you be doing something? I mean, even like said that to be vague about to see if he would just pick something out of the air. 

01:07:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Good example. 

01:07:50
BILL GLASSER Yeah. 

01:07:55
CARLEEN GLASSER Who else would like to share an example? 

01:07:55
HANK When I, a lot of times when I'll come home from work, uh, sometimes, I, I'm big on, uh, securing the house. And sometimes I'll come through, and the, the garage, you know, the first door is open and the second door is open. And the first thing I'll say when I come in is, uh, "Connie, you know, I, I, came in and none of the doors were locked. I mean anybody could walk in here." I, I said, you know, "How many times I gotta ask to have the doors checked for security reasons." I mean, that's the sort of thing I can often enter the, after all day away. 

01:08:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay. Okay. 

01:08:25
CONNIE And then my response would be, see I see it as punishing because then I don't want to talk to him. Yeah, I'd rather not have anything to do with him. I won't say anything , but I, I'll withdraw. 

01:08:40
BILL GLASSER So, this is all, I'm gonna hear more from you on that. 

01:08:40
CONNIE So it's more body language than it is words. 

01:08:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Absolutely. That's a very good point, because sometimes it doesn't have to take a verbal form. It can be the role of the eye, it can be, you know, just walking away and clamming up, or giving them the silent treatment or anything like that can be one of the seven deadly habits. That's true. 

01:09:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Okay, we have Bev and Frank here. And they're going to go through a little situation that they deal with in their marriage involving these seven habits. And, Bill and myself will, will kind of help them, coach them into a different language. A language that is the alternative language to this, this separating kind of language. A language that will hopefully bring them closer together. Some new behaviors that they could maybe discover. So, what's the situation, Frank? 

01:09:35
FRANK She's always likes to do things. You know, if there's, uh, plans to be made, she'll make them, and I'll say, "Well, you should have talked to me first before you did that." Um. 

01:09:45
CARLEEN GLASSER And what do you do, Bev, when he does this? 

01:09:50
BEV I guess I just, well, I get mad. But, I just assume that he knows sometimes, you know, that, and I guess I forget that I do tell him. Or, um. 

01:10:00
CARLEEN GLASSER What, how do you feel when he, he starts to criticize you. 

01:10:05
BEV Oh, I get angry, and I shut down. 

01:10:05
CARLEEN GLASSER What do you mean by shut down? 

01:10:10
BEV I, I kinda withdraw and get quiet. 

01:10:10
CARLEEN GLASSER You get quiet. 

01:10:10
BEV Yeah. 

01:10:10
CARLEEN GLASSER Do you know after you've said what you said, Frank, that she's shutting down and getting quiet? 

01:10:15
FRANK Yeah, it's pretty obvious. It's pretty obvious. 

01:10:20
CARLEEN GLASSER What are you thinking when, when she's, when she says this or when she does this? 

01:10:25
FRANK Okay, uh , well, sometimes in, in my worst moods, I'll be like, oh god, not this again, you know. 

01:10:35
BILL GLASSER You work is to tap it all out, Frank(ph). Okay. I mean in this situation, I mean. But, uh, uh. 

01:10:40
CARLEEN GLASSER Bev, tell us what you would suggest to him on a Saturday morning. 

01:10:45
BILL GLASSER That he would then do his thing. 

01:10:45
CARLEEN GLASSER It kind of surprises him, takes him off. 

01:10:50
BEV You know, I'm ready. I've been out in the car waiting, you know. I mean, you know we're supposed to be going. And you're just inside not doing anything. Just watching TV. You were supposed to get going. 

01:11:00
FRANK Well, I didn't know you were , you know, going now. I thought you were talking about later. You should have told me this. 

01:11:05
BEV But you know that we, that it was gonna be at eleven o'clock, that we were gonna be leaving. 

01:11:10
FRANK Yeah, but that's, you know, it doesn't have to be that hard and fast. I didn't think it was a definite deadline, you know. 

01:11:25
BEV We talked about it. I told you last night. You forgot already? 

01:11:30
FRANK I was asleep. 

01:11:30
BILL GLASSER That's pretty good. That's pretty good. 

01:11:35
CARLEEN GLASSER That's exactly what happens, right? 

01:11:35
BILL GLASSER Okay. Okay. So, let's, since we know the situation, she told you something last night. You've either forgotten it purposefully or not purposefully, but you're not, you certainly haven't dealt with it. And so, here you are and she has now said, "I'm waiting in the car. Where are you? What are you doing sitting there watching television. I told you last night." That's pretty much what you would say. Now, what could you say instead of, uh, at that point, there's, there's not much to say, but it could be something to say , something similar to this. I'll speak for Frank. I'll say, "Well, I'll tell you. I can see that this is already one of these times when we're gonna get aggravated, and I'm not looking for whose fault it is. All I'm saying is that the next time, I'll go now. It's okay, and I'm sorry. But, let's say tomorrow morning, Sunday, and I don't want the same thing to happen again , and so, when we get up in the morning, while we're still in bed, let's take 20 seconds and review the plans of the day. And then if you don't want to do it or I don't want to do it, let's figure it out then." That's what would be the language of closeness. Now, could you then respond for her, to that? 

01:12:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Sure. Well, yeah, I could do that. I think that, I, I'd like to talk about our plans right, you know, ahead of time and everything, but I still get upset with you when you, you get that look on your face and get upset with me. And you kind of, you know, look grumpy and I. 

01:13:10
BILL GLASSER But, look, I'm saying something now to try and solve the problem. So, I can't, I've had those grumpy looks. I've had 5,000 of them since we married each other. I wanna stop them already. And so I'm suggesting that when we get up, let's take a look at this thing ungrumpy-like. 

01:13:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Oh, okay, well, that, that would be better because when you get grumpy and yell at me or, you know, or get real disgruntled with me then I, then I get quiet and then you get mad at me because I get quiet. And, I don't like that either, so I would rather not be, you know, withdrawing from you or going, turning my head or turning my back on you. I would rather. 

01:13:50
BILL GLASSER I mean, I'll give you a hug and a kiss, and say, "Let's talk about today and have a good day instead of what we usually have. I'm, I'm not looking for trouble. I'm stupid but I'm not looking for trouble. I mean, you say something self-depreciating and that's very powerful, you know. 

01:14:05
CARLEEN GLASSER How'd that feel? If he would say something. 

01:14:10
BEV That felt good when he admitted that he, he said he was what, said he was stupid. I don't hear that very much. I don't. 

01:14:20
BILL GLASSER Yeah, but, but there's those little things . See, because when he says, "I'm stupid," it sounds smart to say I'm stupid. It doesn't, when a person says, "I'm stupid." that's a good thing to say. When a person's husband says, "You're stupid." that's not a good thing to say. And so , how, how did this sound to the rest. We're just trying to change the language around. And, and, and see, you can be open. You say, "This happens a lot. We don't want it to happen, so let's plan for it not to happen." I mean, that's the whole thing, because these things that you've all talked about, no one here has talked about the first time it happened. The first time it happened you don't care. It's the fourtieth time it happened. Yes, go ahead. 

01:15:00
JOHN I liked the fact that you didn't change your feelings. You were still aggravated, still frustrated . But you talked about it differently. You didn't have to like, let's make up or anything. 

01:15:10
BILL GLASSER See, you have to have something to say right in the time when you're frustrated. You can't, like, do therapy or something. You talk to them. And you're upset, but you say, "Let's plan for it tomorrow." Today, lets... 

01:15:25
CARLEEN GLASSER I'm sorry, Bill, but what's going on in your head is the important thing. What are you thinking when you're starting to plan for tomorrow. It's not just, let's plan for tomorrow and what the plan is, you're thinking what can I say right now that'll end up having us be closer instead of what usually happens. 

01:15:45
JON CARLSON That was really interesting, Bill, to watch the couples actually bring about changes . Is there a formula that our viewers could follow in, in learning how to do this? 

01:15:55
BILL GLASSER Yeah, exactly. The, uh, the formula is, it's two parts. The first part is you have to try to say something that will defuse the tension, the emotion , the anger in the, in the first part. Like, when he, he, she was in the car waiting and he was still watching TV and paying no attention. And so, I, that's why I told him to say things like, I'm stupid and to try to defuse it. You gotta do something to kinda get the rest of the day to be reasonably okay. And, as I said , one of them has to take responsibility for it. Maybe they both will, but at least one. And then, as a part of the defusing process you try to make a plan that this won't happen again, which is what I was trying to say in terms of when we get up in the morning, I'll give you a hug and we'll figure the day out. Because literally what people do is they keep repeating these things over and over and over again as if it just has to happen, like it's a Greek tragedy that nobody can avoid it. But it can be avoided, and then you change from the language of, of control, I call it the language of disaster into, uh, the language of closeness, because they did. You could see that when they did it they, they felt closer. And, and even Carleen and I felt that, was, like things were better. 

01:17:20
PAT LOVE It really fits in with something you said earlier which is that, what you do with a problem is learn from it. So, you diffuse it, and you make a plan that's related to closeness instead of the distance. 

01:17:30
JON CARLSON I'd be interested in seeing what choices or changes, uh, you've made as a result of this exercise. 

01:17:40
JULIUS My wife and I, we have this little annoying issue that that's ongoing. We, uh, this bed making thing in the morning. Now, she leaves first. I'm, I'll leave after she does. And, um, she likes the bed made. She likes to come home and have the, the room look somewhat neat. And the bed being made gives her that impression that, you know, it's neat. But, anyway, I didn't do it, so she would say, "Okay, I'm tired of nagging. What I'll do, I'll make up my half." Well, that annoyed me, because it makes me look like I'm sloppy. I mean, I know I'm sloppy, but I don't want everybody else to know I'm sloppy. So, um, I said, "No, no, no, this will never work. This will never work." And she did that for about a week, maybe two. And I just got thoroughly frustrated. So, I says, "Okay , I'll tell you what. Don't bother with the bed, I'll make it up." And I did that for about two weeks, and now we, it's off and on, but we came to a resolution saying, "Well, okay, we'll make it up together." 

01:18:35
CARLEEN GLASSER But, that is a real creative solution . Let's do it together. 

01:18:40
PAT LOVE I love the metaphor, that you're making up together. I like that. That's good. 

01:18:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Making up together. 

01:18:45
BILL GLASSER We're still on one side and the other side. It was, it was getting there. I'm not complaining, but it was getting there. 

01:18:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Well, the day that they, she makes up his side, and he makes up her side, then they'll be together. 

01:18:55
ARLIS Actually, tell them I did that one time. I made up his side and didn't make up my side. And he came upstairs, and he's like, "Oh, I don't like this either." 

01:19:05
JULIUS Well, there's a silver lining to the cloud. We both mess it up together. 

01:19:10
CY The thing I liked is when Dr. Glasser mentioned creative conversation. Uh, my problem with the garage door when I come home, a lot of times as soon as I walk in, is that, hi, how are you doing. Giving her a hug. Any conversation at all, it's, "Why's the garage door open?" So, maybe if I take some time to see how her day's been, to tell her I miss her, give her a hug, give her a little kiss, sit down and have coffee. 

01:19:40
KIM Then yell at me. 

01:19:45
CY Then, "Oh, by the way." But, but not be so accusatory, you know. Maybe, you know, we have the snow blower out in the garage sitting right on the end. Somebody could just walk by and pick it up, you know. Little suggestions like that might help a little bit. 

01:20:00
BILL GLASSER Something occurred to me when you were saying that. And, and I've been working on this in our marriage, a little tiny bit. It's, I put a name to it. I call it the ten second correction. When you walk in the house and the garage door's open and the house door's open, it doesn't take, it takes less than ten seconds to correct it. And then, just correct certain things, and, and don't bother with it. She's got a bunch of kids there. She's got enough trouble. I mean if it's a ten minute correction or a four day correction, okay. But, you know, you're married. Give her ten seconds. I mean, that's all I'm saying. 

01:20:35
KIM I like that. 

01:20:40
PAT LOVE I'm so impressed with how much work got done in a short period of time. 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON Sure. 

01:20:45
PAT LOVE Really impressed with it. 

01:20:45
Exercise 3 The Rubber Band Connection 

01:20:45
JON CARLSON Well, I'm interested in the next exercise too, because the next exercise we're gonna learn some more about choices. What an opportunity to do the Rubber Band Exercise. 

01:21:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Uh, what you'll need before you start is to find two rubber bands in your house, both of equal size . And it helps for them to be two different colors, but that's not totally necessary. And what you do with the rubber bands is tie them together, just by looping them together so that they make a knot in the center. So, then you'll have two rubber bands knotted together. And, taking a look at this symbol , you can also draw it on a piece of paper. And you would put this piece of paper then between you and your husband, or you could... 

01:21:35
BILL GLASSER On a table. 

01:21:35
She Wants Marriage or Relationship Wants He Wants 

01:21:35
CARLEEN GLASSER on a table, or you could stand in front, one on one side of the television, and one on the other, and use the actual, this actual image on the screen. What they represent is, this circle represents the husband, and Bill's gonna play this part, cuz he's my husband. And this little symbole represents the wife . So, the husband will stand over here, and the wife would stand over here. Or sit if you're gonna use it on a piece of paper. What you could just do is draw two circles on a piece of paper, and then this little symbol in the center is the marriage, the entity between the two of us. This is our relationship. This is what we, we both want. Now what we have inside this little opening here is all of Bill's wants, what he wants. And in a specific situation, he'll want one thing. And he's gonna tell you what that is. And this is what I want in my situation. And what we're gonna show with the rubber band, do you have it with you? 

01:22:35
BILL GLASSER Yeah. 

01:22:35
CARLEEN GLASSER I'm gonna take my part of the rubber band, and he's gonna take his. Wait a minute. I have to get my arm over here. 

01:22:45
BILL GLASSER There we go. 

01:22:45
CARLEEN GLASSER This way. Okay, now we're all right. And what we're going to do is try in our marriage to reduce conflict whenever we can. Let's hold it out further so I don't hit. We're gonna try to reduce the conflict, and, and, and when we have no conflicts in, in our relationship, the knot can pretty much stay within this little center part, which is the entity between us. 

01:23:10
BILL GLASSER Yeah, if I pull, she pulls a little to keep it there. If I relax, she relaxes a little. As long as we're staying. The knot represents our connection. And we're kinda keeping it over things we want in our relationship that we both share. And so, there it is. 

01:23:25
CARLEEN GLASSER Something that I like to do a lot and, it's a, it's a chosen behavior. All behavior is chosen, and the only person I can control is myself, mind you. And the only person Bill can control is his, himself and his own behavior. What, one thing, one behavior I use a lot, is I like to talk to my daughter on the phone. And she lives in New York, and so we are on the phone occasionally, you know, not every day, but a lot. And, sometimes I'm on the phone with her, and what do you want, Bill? 

01:24:00
BILL GLASSER Recently, she bought a cellular phone, so now they're on the phone 24 hours a day. 

01:24:05
CARLEEN GLASSER Not really. 

01:24:05
BILL GLASSER And so, uh, I want her, let's, come on, Carleen. Put down the cellular phone, and I don't want to hear it in the car all the way to the show. I want to go. It's, we're gonna miss the movie. It's crowded. And so , my, I want the movie. And, and she wants to talk. And, but, our relationship is in the middle. And so, I can only control my own behavior, so I push toward leaving. And, she's pull toward talking. But, now you see the tension in the relationship. And if I pull back now , it'll break and, it'll be awful. And so, uh, what we need to do is figure out a way to. 

01:24:45
CARLEEN GLASSER Somebody has to give. 

01:24:45
BILL GLASSER Somebody has to give a little bit, so I give a little, and then maybe she gives a little. And we get in there. But see, I can move up and she can, if she wants to keep it over the thing, she could move down. I can move down and she can move up. See, what that illustrates is that the only person's behavior we can control is our own. 

01:25:05
CARLEEN GLASSER But, if I, if I want the knot to be in the center, when I'm wanting to talk on the phone but I also want to save the relationship, I'm gonna have to give a little. 

01:25:15
BILL GLASSER Right. 

01:25:15
CARLEEN GLASSER To get it back into the center . I think we talked about that earlier. You have to give a little. And, if he wants to leave right now, this second, and I'm on the phone, well we could, we could compromise and find. What, what would you give in to here? 

01:25:30
BILL GLASSER Well, I'd give in a little bit if I wanted to compromise. But, you know if you don't put that dog gone phone down, I'm gonna pull it until this thing breaks, and we're both gonna get hurt. 

01:25:40
CARLEEN GLASSER And that, that's what happens in real relationships. 

01:25:45
BILL GLASSER Right. I'm gonna get real mad and let go, and then you'll get hurt. 

01:25:50
CARLEEN GLASSER And that happens in real relationships too, where the conflict gets so bad that one person actually does lash out in some way, let go of the rubber band. 

01:26:00
BILL GLASSER Or just leave the house and slam the door. 

01:26:00
CARLEEN GLASSER Slam the door, that's letting go of the rubber band. That's leaving, that's leaving this little area where we're getting, where we want to get along. 

01:26:10
BILL GLASSER This is illustrating what goes on. This tension in the relationship when you're not accounting for the marriage, you're only accounting for what you want. See, I have what I want now, but then she quickly pulls back. And then she pulls hard to get what she wants, and I give a little bit and say, "No, that's not good." And I pull back, and then you see what happens. So, just do it a little bit and think of yourself as your connected in a marriage. 

01:26:35
CARLEEN GLASSER Think of a situation that you have a little conflict around and get into a dialog wit h one another and see if you can possibly get the knot of the rubber band back into the center, or give a little to the other person by, the only way you can get it back in the center is both of you will have to give a little to the other person. Give in a little. And so, see if you can work that out in an actual kind of activity that you do here in the audience and at home, and see what happens. 

01:27:15
[music] 

01:27:15
Please Pause Here & Practice 

01:27:15
JON CARLSON I was wondering if people had as much fun doing this activity as we did watching it. 

01:28:25
PAT LOVE I know. It looked like there were a lot of learnings going on to me. 

01:28:30
JON CARLSON Let's find out just what you learned from this activity, cuz it seemed like there was a lot of, what do they say , aha insights that occurred. 

01:28:35
HANK One of the things that crossed my mind. Insisting on my own way and Connie sometimes, when I really had a grip of this thing, and I was really trying to keep it over my needs, uh, she was hard pressed to pull it away from me. And, uh, I could insist on my own way, but I voluntarily am, uh, giving up ground, uh, I think there is a volunteering of it that has to take place. I, I just became more aware that if I'm going to be friends with this woman and in this relationship have it grow, I have to give ground , even though I know my definition is here. I wanna give ground. And the other thing happened when we were moving this knot. It was almost an opportunity to speak, and then go back to the middle. And then I wanted to hear what she had to say, and she wanted to speak up, so, you know, giving her opportunity to voice her concerns, her needs. And then it was almost an opportunity to listen as the thing moved back and forth. So, it was kinda fun that way. 

01:29:35
PAT LOVE That's a lot. 

01:29:35
JON CARLSON That is a lot. Great. 

01:29:35
JULIUS I was at one point, it got so intense that I was kinda frightened that the rubber band was gonna break, and that would indicate the relationship breaking. So, um, I, I always thought that at any minute now this thing is gonna snap. And, somebody's gonna feel a sharp pain. And so, um, she said me, but, uh, threatening. See, but that's what I was thinking. Not to break, not to break the rubber brand. I don't want our relationship to go down the drain. 

01:30:10
CARLEEN GLASSER So, you chose not to let the rubber band break. 

01:30:15
JULIUS Right. 

01:30:15
CARLEEN GLASSER You chose to keep the relationship intact. 

01:30:15
JULIUS Correct. 

01:30:15
JON CARLSON What, what a deceptively simple exercise. That's such, great learning. 

01:30:25
BILL GLASSER It also, it also shows how strong the relationship is. You can maintain a relationship when you have a tremendous amount of tension, but why pay the price? 

01:30:30
JON CARLSON That's what you guys were saying. 

01:30:35
FRANK That's what I was thinking is, it's like, when we were holding it. I don't know why, but we were stretching it out, and I was thinking, "Boy, after a while this is starting to dig into my hands." So, if you did have that tension for a long time, it would start to wear you down physically. 

01:30:50
JON CARLSON This is just so awesome to see this, uh, this kind of insight occur. And we have one activity left. Uh, next we're gonna move on , and you're gonna get the opportunity to learn, which I think is the most powerful of the techniques , of the activities to do, that being the Solving Circle. 

01:31:10
Exercise 4 The Solving Circle 

01:31:10
BILL GLASSER We're now going to now demonstrate with, uh, Arlis and Julius is something that, that I call the solving circle. And the purpose of the solving circle is to give you a tool that you can use in your marriage to literally solve any problem that comes up, if you use the tool correctly. So, I'll describe it and, uh, I asked Arlis before we started, what's one of the typical problems in their marriage. Well, our problem is that, uh, Julius is more like a grasshopper, and she's more like an ant. She's always saying, now we gotta be careful, conservative, get things done. And Julius says, "Come on. Let's go out and have a good time and not worry about the future for five or six minutes or five or six weeks, whatever it happens to be." But, but the point is that's a problem between them. Now, uh, keeping that in mind, let's now get into what the solving circle is, because if you've got two chairs at home that you can put together, you can form the solving circle. That's the only thing you need is two chairs approximately like the chairs that they're sitting in here. You won't have me at home. I'm just here to demonstrate what it is. At home, you'll do essentially what I'm gonna show you, but one or both of you will do it as part of your thing. So, uh, with this problem in mind, and you say it's an ongoing problem, and we're working on it, but here's how you deal with it, not perhaps the whole problem all the time, but deal with it when it comes up a few times, deal with it right then at that point using the solving circle. So, you've now, we're gonna go kinda backwards a little bit. You've learned the circle, so now you're sitting here, but I haven't taught it to you yet. But , you would then go into two chairs and sit beside each other. Now, what I would say is, the first thing I would do, and you would do this for yourself. Hold out your hand . I'm gonna give you some magic chalk and give you a big bunch of magic chalk. And if you're out of it , just, uh, call me or something. I'll send you more, because I've got lots of it . And for the audience, I'll throw you a bunch too, and you keep it forever and ever. And it's , it's thick greasy yellow chalk, but it's magic, so you don't kinda know it's there. But it doesn't, I'm gonna draw now. I'm gonna get up and draw a circle all around you with the chalk. So you can see it. It's about a three inch wide bright yellow circle on the floor. But it doesn't imprison you. It' sjust a circle. You can step out anytime you want. Now in the marriage circle is a wife, a husband, and an entity. The entity sits right between you. Now, what is the entity that's always in the marriage circle or it won't work? 

01:34:00
Solving Circle 1. Are you here to get help for your marriage? 

01:34:00
Solving Circle 2. Whose behavior do you always know you can control? 

01:34:00
Solving Circle 3. what's wrong with your marriage right now? 

01:34:00
Solving Circle 4. Whats good about your marriage right now? 

01:34:00
ARLIS Trust? 

01:34:00
BILL GLASSER Trust? No, trust is not an entity, but this is, this is an actual thing. Trust is important certainly. You have a husband, a wife, and this thing sits between you. 

01:34:15
JULIUS I wanna say relationship. 

01:34:15
BILL GLASSER The relationship. And what is the relationship? 

01:34:20
ARLIS Marriage. 

01:34:20
BILL GLASSER The marriage. Okay. There's a husband, husband, wife and the marriage is always here, sitting here. Okay. Arlis, and I'll ask you to do it here, and see if Julius and you can do it. Arlis, what I want you to do, something you've probably never done before with this particular problem, or someone similar to it, is I want you to say to Julius, "Julius, we've got this problem. You know we've got it. I want to do the windows. You wanna go out in the park and play." So, ordinarily what you would say is, "Julius, now come on, Julius. Get the windows and then we'll go to the park." That would be the normal sensible thing to say. But, you've said it every summer for now fifteen summers, and it hasn't worked . And, Julius would say, "Arlis, it's a beautiful day. We don't get this many days. Let's go to the park, etc." So, that's what he ordinarily would say, and what you've said. This time you would say, "Julius, we've got this problem, and here's what I think I could do to help solve the problem." You would never mention what he can do. Remember, we did that rubber band thing. You can only control your own behavior. So, you would say, and Julius would say, "Well, here's what I think I could do to help solve the problem." You see, you're coming from a totally different way. You're not blaming, complaining. No, you're just saying, could either of you come up, I'll help you with this, but if you could come up with something, it'd be better. What could you come up with in this situation, here it is, 10:30 in the morning, and what could you say that might help solve the problem, Arlis? See you're, to, to play by the rules of the solving circle, you only can say something that you think might help the problem, maybe even solve it. Is there anything you can come up with. 

01:36:15
Solving Circle 1. Are you here to get help for your marriage? 

01:36:15
Solving Circle 2. Whose behavior do you always know you can control? 

01:36:15
Solving Circle 3. what's wrong with your marriage right now? 

01:36:15
Solving Circle 4. Whats good about your marriage right now? 

01:36:15
Solving Circle 5. What is the one thing you cand o for a week that you believe will significantly help your marriage? Each partner agrees that what the other offers would be helpful to THE MARRIAGE. 

01:36:15
ARLIS We could hire somebody to take care of the windows. 

01:36:20
BILL GLASSER All right, now see, that would be a solution. Julius? Well, there's a big strong teenage kid down near you, always yelling for work. Work, we could hire him? So we pay 25 dollars or 50 dollars, whatever he charges, and we go to the park. Now, what would you say. Now, you would not comment on that. You would just say, "Well, Arlis, that certainly might do it. Here's what I think I could do to solve the problem." It might relate to what she said or it might not. 

01:36:50
JULIUS Well, I think, uh, with regards to resolution, um. 

01:37:00
BILL GLASSER What could you do? 

01:37:00
JULIUS I could probably, uh, do the windows myself, but possibly on another day, maybe. Uh. 

01:37:10
BILL GLASSER You have to give her another day that you'd say you'd do it. 

01:37:15
JULIUS The next, the very next, uh, day that is sunny outside. 

01:37:20
BILL GLASSER I don't think she'll accept that, Julius. I'll tell you why. Because you've said it many times and it hasn't worked out that way. So, coming up with what you said in the past that hasn't worked doesn't make any sense. She's heard that song before . Now she's come up with an idea that's maybe a little bit new in this situation. Let's hire someone to do it. How does that sound to you? Are you a tightwad or will you say, "What the hell, let's do it." 

01:37:50
BILL GLASSER I could say. 

01:37:50
BILL GLASSER I'm not saying you're a dummy. I'm not saying, I'm not putting you down. I'm just saying, do you not want to spend the money? You might come up with some, well, I don't want to spend 50 dollars to get the windows done. 

01:38:00
JULIUS Well, I don't want to spend 50 dollars to get the windows done. 

01:38:00
BILL GLASSER Okay, so then what could you do to help solve the problem. 

01:38:05
JULIUS I can put the windows up myself on my time schedule, um, but I would. 

01:38:10
BILL GLASSER But, she doesn't trust that. You have to give her some sense of trust. Now, I could make a suggestion, which is, let's say it costs 50 bucks to get the windows taken down and new ones, whatever they do . Uh, how about this. This is trying to get this solved, something that you could do . You could say, "Arlis, I want to go to the park. I've said a lot of times that I'll do it, but sometimes I haven't. I'll take out my wallet now. I'll give you 50 bucks. I say I'll do it Monday night. If I do it Monday night, you give me back the 50 bucks. If I don't do it Monday night, you keep the 50 bucks . Do you see the difference between those two? 

01:38:55
ARLIS I like that. 

01:38:55
BILL GLASSER Would, would that, would that be acceptable solution to you? 

01:39:00
ARLIS I like that. 

01:39:00
BILL GLASSER See? It's something he can do. And, and you've already said. 

01:39:05
ARLIS I have an insurance policy right in my hands. 

01:39:05
BILL GLASSER Right, and, and, and, but, but you already said, "I'm willing to spend the 50 bucks." The 50 bucks is marital money. It's not, it's not your money, although sometimes a little bit. But, I mean, this is not like 50 cents. This is a considerable expenditure. Okay. And then Julius might say, but if you're gonna do it with the 50 dollars, he might say, "You gotta do it." In other words, you get the kid, you supervise him and everything else. How would, how would that be to you? 

01:39:35
ARLIS I don't have a problem with that. 

01:39:35
BILL GLASSER No problem with that. So you can't say, "Well, the kid loused up the job and everything." Okay. Is that acceptable to you, Julius? 

01:39:45
JULIUS Sounds good to me. 

01:39:45
BILL GLASSER Do, do you see how it works? Whatever the problem is, now, here's the other part of the solving circle, which is , let's say that the problem between you and, Arlis and yourself was she nagged, nagged, nagged all the time. Just, a hypothetical problem. And so, she could then say to you, "Julius, when I usually nag you about something, I'm not gonna nag anymore." You've, let's say you've offered something that would solve the problem, and so she'll say, "Well, I won't nag anymore." Let's say that you, you worked too late at night, and she nags you, nags you, nags you. And the more she nags you, the more you don't want to come home. Now, she says, "You said I'll be home three times a week exactly at six o'clock so we can have three nights a week we really know I'm home, and the other nights I'll call you." And she accepts that. And then you look at her, and she says , "I can stop nagging for a whole week." Okay. Now, here's the thing that's important. That when she says she won't nag, regardless of whether or not you come home, she shouldn't nag for that week. See, that shows you something and leads you to feel a little guilty and let's you say, see, she can do it . And so it may be that what, what you know is, then she also knows that if she nags, you're still gonna come home. That's the deal. But if you know that's the deal, then you come home and she doesn't nag. So, you realize it's the deal. That's why it's called a solving circle.

CARLEEN GLASSER Keeping in mind that the marriage takes precedence over what I want, specifically, what I want. 

01:41:40
BILL GLASSER What'll help the marriage. 

01:41:40
CARLEEN GLASSER So, it also, they, they, they give the suggestion not only to help solve the problem, but to help the marriage. 

01:41:45
JON CARLSON And then if you can't come up with solutions, uh, you can leave the circle and come back at a later time. 

01:41:50
CARLEEN GLASSER Yup. Sure. 

01:41:55
JON CARLSON And, when you. 

01:41:55
CARLEEN GLASSER You're not locked in. 

01:41:55
JON CARLSON When you come up with suggestions, you do it for a specified period of time to make sure that there's enough time to make it really work. 

01:42:00
BILL GLASSER So that you can see that each party is doing their part. 

01:42:05
JON CARLSON Okay. 

01:42:05
PAT LOVE Right, and, and what I liked about it is it sounded like a win-win-win. That you win, because, you know, Arlis, you won because you got the windows done. Julius, you won because you got to go play and you didn't have to pay the 50 dollars. So, it's like everybody wins, and the relationship wins because you each were moving in the other's direction. So, it sounded like you get together, you have a problem, you sit down, you draw the circle, you real, sit comfortably, whatever way you want to sit. I like that, just you know, men like to face forward. Women like to face each other. So, you just sit comfortably, you know. So, and you really image that relationship between the two of you. That, I realize that this exercise in my mind in many ways incorporates everything you've taught us. That I'm making a choice, but the choice includes, not only what's good for me. It's not an either/or. It's what's good for the relationship, and what can I offer that really moves us toward connection? It's the language of closeness versus the language of disconnection. 

01:43:05
JON CARLSON On those words, we'd like to thank you very much for being with us and helping us to learn about choices. 

01:43:10
BILL GLASSER It was a lot of fun for us. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm glad that the people could help us.
