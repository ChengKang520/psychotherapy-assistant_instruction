ANNELLEN SIMPKINS Hello, everyone, welcome. My name is Annellen Simpkins and I am very privileged to be the moderator today for Dan Siegel who will talk to us about adolescent brains. Uhm, Dan is truly a pioneer in this area, he has open the integration for all of us as clinicians of the mind and the brain in clinical practice. And he ha-- he's a person who is really devoted to the idea of integration and you see that reflected in his work and his life. He as integrated very beautifully the, uhm, educational research and clinical aspect of neurobiology and you see that in all of the different positions, many positions that he holds. Uhm, ah, and a s an educator he's the director of the Mindsight institute devoted to education and research in neurobiology. He's the faculty of the center for, uhm, culture brain and development. He's a professor at UCLA school of medicine and then his research side. He's the director of the mindful awareness research center helping to open the way for all us to be able to integrate mindfulness into our treatments thanks to this wonderful research that he does. He's authored many books and I hope that you are all looking at them, they're wonderful off quoted. Uhm, The Mindful Brain is one of them, Mindsight and he has to soon to be release new book Brain Stor-- Storm the Power and, uhm, and Purpose of the Teenage Brain. So it is with great pleasure please join me in welcoming Dan Siegel.

DAN SIEGEL Thanks a lot. Thank you. That's a about how excited I am to be here with you all today. Thank you all for coming it's really, really, ah, an honor to be here with all of us in the field of mental health, ah, to talk about a very important and yet misunderstood period of life, ah, the adolescent period of life. So that's what we'll be diving into. Let me just check technology, is the sound okay for you in the back? Is it good, you can here? Okay, fantastic. So part of all of we talking about and this talk is about communication and making sure that the messages that we send are, are understood both ways across the generational divide. And in my own personal life, uhm, my wife and I have two children, ah, basically they're through their teenage years but they're still adolescence cuz they are in their basically early 20s. And it is true that this period of adolescence which can be simply defined as the period childhood dependency and adulthood responsibility. This period, ah, doesn't end when the teenage years end. And what happen to me was after writing a few books on the mind and development in stuff like that and then translating a few of those with my colleagues Mary Hartzell and Tina Bryson on books for parenting, ah, as that was happening people would ask me to write books on the teenage years. And having teenagers at all-- first of all, how many of you have teenagers who live in home with you. Okay. So take a look around, uhm, you can be supportive us, those who don't. How many of you use to have teenagers who live at home? Okay. There's a huge amount. And how many of you wants were adolescence? Okay. So we're all in good company here. So, people would ask me to write a book on the teenage, ah, period and having teenager at home I said it's impossible to write when you're the middle of it cuz you have no idea what's going on. Uhm, so what happens to me over the years and more recently when I decided to try this out was when I look to the popular out on adolescence I was actually shock to find that when I compared either popular media or popular books with what science was not telling us in the last dozen years about what we understand about the adolescent period. There was a huge discrepancy. So part of me because I also write a whole professional series of books on the interpersonal neurobiology of the field where we combine all the sciences together and apply it in the world for mental health for example on education and parenting. Was I felt it was important for the professional side for us to know what was going on, so I thought, "Okay, I'll write a book for professionals." But then I know my friends who had kids were on the same age is our kids and they were still misguided by this myths that were out in the popular culture. And the myths were not only wrong but if you believed them as a parent or even worst, if you heard them and believe them as an adolescent you're life would actually worst. You'll be destructive if you don't believe this myths. So then I thought, "Okay, well I'll write it for the parents. And then I thought wa-- why not actually write it for an adolescent him or herself. So I look in the literature if there was anything written for adolescents and teenagers both and there was nothing. So, I thought, "Okay. Well it that might be something to try to do." Ah, and I got to say this book called Brain Storm which is the result of that research and to all of the science on adolescence specially the adolescent brain which we'll talk about now. And the popular literature were so divergent that to, to have a book that actually a teenager or an older adolescent because adolescence is really these days best considers the second dozen years of life12 to 24 more or less. So let's review some of the things that are know and some of the myths that are out there and try to divorce those myths. Then let's look at what we can use as metal health professionals or as parents or as adolescence ourselves to take this essential message about what is now understood about the adolescent period and see if it changes the way we can live either while we're in this period of growth or afterwards and would have might imply for us. So that's what we would be doing in this next brief period of time. Now, the book was the hardest book I've ever written because I decided to test drive it with teenagers. So, so when I would I write a version of it I'd send it out to people I know who had teenagers or order adolescence I get the feedback which was sometimes pretty had to take and then I'd rewrite the book. And I rewrote it and sent it out again, got the feedback back from adults and adolescents and I rewrote it until finally it wasn't a voice that was rese-- receive by both sides of the generation, uhm, the generations. And what was really, ah, amazing is after doing that I understand why there is no book written for both generations. Believe me, ah, people at the Mindset Institute where I work they would see me so I, I got to cancel this contract this is not gonna work, this is impossible and I wonder no one is don't done it. And the, the, ah, suggestions were fascinating, some people said, "Well, why don't you write two books and make it so like the odd pages for the adults and the even pages of adolescent." And I actually try that for about 10 minutes and it really didn't feel right. It felt like if they're should, should be one conversation. And certainly as an adolescent psychiatrist who treat adolescence. Uhm, although the first way you'll see soon is actually a good thing. Uhm, it was, ah, it wasn't really, uhm, ah, really fun challenge try to put make it like a conversation. So, so far, ah, because the book, ah, will be formally release January 7th you have sneak peek here at the evolution of psychotherapy conference which is an exciting thing there were few, ah, limited copies are out there but you can preorder it in all that stuff and get ready for it because it's-- to me it's gonna be so exciting to see if these messages can be taken then by an adolescent him or herself as well as the adults who care for them. Okay, so what are the myths and what do we know about the truths. So one myth-- let me just check it out with you. How many of you heard this statement that the adolescent period is a time of raging hormones that drive and adolescence start act in bizarre ways, raise your hand really high so we can see. Now, look at that that is a very common, it is wrong. It's just wrong. And now it is true hormones of course influence are life throughout the lifespan. There very important part of what influences the mind, it influences all things all the time any age you are. Ah, when I use to be in pediatrics we always were concern about the endocrine system of 1 year old and 2-year-old. So, so hormones always affect us but the changes in the way adolescence feel the way they think and the way they behave. We now know is not do to changes and, ah, and the hormonal ragingness status. It's actually do we believe to changes in the function and structure of the brain. And these are things we didn't understand 12 years ago and the science of course is emerging like any science but we need to understand these changes which we will review today. So the, the first myth to bank is, is not raging hormones and the good news is if it is raging hormones of course it gives you a feeling of helplessness. "I'm a teenager I've just got raging hormones no wonder I act like this." But if it's the brain we know from the study of neuroplasticity that what you do in your relationships and what you do in the focus of your attention two things that shape your mind cuz the mind is both the relational and embodied process. What you do with your relationships and your tension actually we now know can change this function and even the structure of your brain. So, throughout the Brain Storm book you'll see there are these exercises to teach the adolescent how to make their brain more what we call integrated linking differentiated parts. So, that's the first myth, it's not raging hormones which are very dis-empowering and, and some ways insulting and wrong, ah, statement to make. So, that's the first thing. The second myth, how many of you heard that the adolescent period is one of immaturity and the adolescent just needs to grow up. Anybody hear that? That's also a very common one, it's also wrong. We now understand that adolescence is a period of necessary transformation with a remodeling of the brain. So just like if we took this hotel and said, you know, we're gonna remodel the hotel. You wouldn't say that the hotel was the immature you would say that it's just shifting its different aspects. And of course when something is being remodel things don't always work ideally, ah, and as you'll see that's true with the remodeling period of the adolescent brain too. But by calling it immature what that does is it tells the adolescent I am an immature person and that's what I am. And that term as we know from the way linguistic influences are believes in our sense of meaning and even the way we encode memory, uhm, this statement made by the larger culture if it's taken in which it usually is by adults and adolescence will actually get adolescences to act in immature way. So this is a serious second myth. Adolescence are not immature there in a period remodeling and that's a very, very different developmental statement. A third myth that's out there is adolescence's period and let me see how many of you have heard this which is so difficult and such a pain in the butt that you just wanna get through as fast as you can. If you can without much ba-- battle scars you maybe have heard that, raise your hand, I'm. So, you could see it's a very common myth and of course if you believe that myth as you're adolescence it's gonna be very scary. "They tell me it's a horrible period of time and I'm entering it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" And, ah, you know, this view from an adult of course makes you miss the incredibly powerful things we'll talk about very soon that our opportunities of adolescence that I believe the way we structure our family life and the way we structure our community life and the way we structure our curricular, in schools and the way we structure our larger culture is actually missing an unbelievable opportunity to tap in to the courage and creativity of the adolescent period. And so what I'm gonna invite you do to because you're really on the ban guard of this right at this moment is think about some of these things we're gonna get into and how you can participate in changing the cultural conversations about how we relate to adolescence. So what's our third myth, we have, we have the raging hormones, we have the immaturity, we have the things just to get through. That's our third myth. And instead what we're gonna see is there's an essence to adolescence that actually is not only something you need to just get through it's something you can learn to cultivate well during adolescence. As you'll see the essence of adolescence is something that we adults should hold on to and not just get through. It's the opposite of getting through. What's a fourth myth? A fourth myth is a little more settle but you hear it in conversations in elevators and hall ways and that is that adolescence is a period of time when the young teenager needs to push away and become independent of all adults. How many have heard bits? It's totally independent the way you're going for. And that's actually false. Adolescence when you look at across the mammalian king-- million class of animals and specially primates, specially we humans we need other adults besides our parents and parent figure to stay in our lives anything we're trust where the non-parental figures can be in an adolescence life. And we don't structure anything we're trust where the non-parental figures can be in an adolescence life. And so of course they don't have this important part of being introduce as a rite of passage into the larger adult world. And we're abandoning our responsibility. So this myth of total independents should be rethought of us the movement toward interdependence where you do need-- yes the brain as you'll see soon is genetically program to push away from adult figures who were parent figures. You'll the see there reason for that soon but not push away from all adults cuz the extreme is not what we're looking for. The final myth that we'll talk about in this first segment is, ah, the myth that, ah, the risk taking that adolescence do and that's absolutely true. There are three times as likely unfortunately to have serious accidents or suicide or murder. So serious life changing including life ending events are absolutely more likely during the adolescent period in spite of this adolescent period being the time our bodies are the healthiest. You can fight off disease better as it adolescent and you can at any other period of life and yet you are more likely to get injured or die. It is literally the most dangerous period of time for preventable things happening to you. So this is really strange. Now how many of you have heard, "Well of course adolescence are like that because they're prefrontal cortex is immature and they're just impulsive." Raise your hand about that. And that's false. That's false, in fact I use even joke before I read this scientific literature that the only people who knew about this were the rental car companies and they would just not rent a car anyone less than 25. All right. And that was a fun joke and everybody laugh like we're laughing right now. But the fact is its false. In fact to say the free frontal cortex is immature is a, a reduction of statement that misses that points we're gonna get into now. Cuz we specially is health professionals and specially as parents need to embrace the actual things that happen in the brain where I think coming up with fun little jokes. You know, so okay, if it's not impulsivity and it's not just immature to the prefrontal regulatory cortex what's going on. And I'll give you just the statement to take home but we're gonna on to the details of it next. The statement to take home is this, is that yes there's no question teenagers cannot regulate impulses well as they will later on in the early as part of the teenage years. But the danger of this risky behaviors continues past the period in which impulsivity is really prevalent. So what's going on? Well it turns out that the way certain areas to the brain that we're gonna review next are changing make it so that the thrill of, ah, a decision is emphasize much than the potential dangers and risk in negative outcomes. So in another words you height the froze and you diminish you interest in the cons. And that has a weird name that I would love if someone can come up with the better one but it's what we use in science so I put in the book, uhm, but it's kind of odd it's called the hyper rational thinking. So that the, the secondary part of this myth that adolescence are in danger cuz they're impulsive which is wrong is partially true but it's not the whole true. Ah, is that well adolescence do the dangerous things they do because they're just not informed of the danger. Actually the study show they're well aware what the danger is telling them doesn't do really much of anything to decrease that danger. And there are other things we are gonna talk about you can do but the fact is their limbic area, the area that evaluates in the phrases the meaning of things and the significance of aspects of a choice when it's planning out action is over emphasizing. If you wanna use that word or, or highlighting the positives diminishing an attention to the negatives. And so that's called hyper-rational thinking, ah, that's the term and so anyway. So it's, it's not impulsivity so much as hyper-rational processing that you can actually work with an adolescent to get, get a deeper way of processing choice that's just different from saying, "Don't do it." Okay. So those are the five huge myths, what are the truths? Now how many of you were in my workshop the other where we, we spent that lovely morning on Wednesday, ah, raise your hands so I can see. Okay, so no-- not that many people. So, I'm, I'm not gonna do joke cuz there's too many here to tell the joke. But it-- on Wednesday what we do as I said the evolution conference was so nice and they put a model of the brain under your chair. So for those of you who got it the other day we know we're you're sitting we didn't put it. But for those who weren't there if you reach on to your chair. Just reach on to your chair you'll find this model of the brain. No way, I'm just kidding. If you pull out your arm, pull out your arm you'll find attached to your arm a hand and this hand were now gonna go into because it's a hand model of the brain. And if you put your thumb in the middle of your palm and then full your fingers over the top this will be orientation of the brain in your and model that be in my head like this. And we're gonna go through the parts of the brain very briefly but we're gonna look at how they change during adolescence. Because again the, the premise here is that new studies of the adolescent brain did bank all of those myths and reveal truths that transform the cultural conversation about what adolescence is reorganize how we parent. Reorganized how we teach. Reorganize how we use this whole important period of time. So as we get into the brain, let me just say this you, you heard I, I participate in the center called The Center for Culture Brain and Development. So the first thing to say is that we know that experience change the structure of the brain. We know that cultural environment changes the structure of the brain it's a form of experience. So most of the studies of the adolescent brain have been done on American youth. And we just need to understand it, it's within the context of American culture. So if we went to Papua New Guinea and study the adolescent brain we might find something very different. After all none of us were alive then but 150 years ago when did adolescents begin around 16 or 17 years of age girls began their period. Menses for puberty it's not exactly the same as adolescence but it's the reference we can have. It's, it's-- many people that when adolescence begin the onset of puber-- puberty, their sexual maturation boys a little bit later than girls. And then in those days when would females and males get ready to settle down with adult responsibility about two years later when you be about 18, 19 years of age. That-- so adolescence before was two years. For reasons no one can explain people say it's food. People say it's the hormones and the chicken. People it's, ah, the cultural expectations. We just don't have an answer to it, uhm, seriously it could be all those thing. But anyway adolescence is now extended it's, not 16 or 17 it's more like 11 or 12 sometimes even 10 or nine. The onset of menses and boys usually about a year and half or two years later and then when this adolescence in? Right, 40, 45, exactly. So-- anyway it's longer it's at least a dozen year so we're gonna just called the dozen but there is no absolute demarcation of the end of adolescence and some of the thoughts I been given lately it's been beautiful that people come up for 27, 28 say, "I still think I'm an adolescent." And it's good for you, you know, that's, that's great but it's-- so we'll talk about there's no clear ending but just for orientation sake. We'll say it's about a dozen year, second dozen years of life and that's basically with the brains studies of American kids are showing. And that's across raises but it's American culture they're living in. Okay, so what do we know about the brain, let's quickly review it and then we'll go through the parts in how they're changing. So, you know, the sperm and-- I don't wanna surprise anyone but the sperm and egg get the together that's not a shock. Uhm, the single cell becomes many cells ultimately a neural tube as form from the outer layer what's call the ectoderm important thing for that is that the nervous system is always about the inner and the outer interface. Very, very important of that we call the brain but really were talking about the whole body and how energy information flow steaming through this body. So the nervous system is all about the inner and the outer the neural tube forms a bunch of neurons, the basic cells of the brain, and the nervous system hang out up in the head they expand, ah, during in utero growth the brain stand this. If y you lift up your fingers and lift up your thumb the severe your palm area and this area controls our basic responses of how we deal with our, our heart and our lungs and our intestines it determines whether awake or sleep and importantly it has the nuclei the clusters of neurons that create the fight, flight, freeze and faint four F of reactive states. So it's a very basic part of brands well develop at birth, it's really old 300 million years old meaning it's an old reptilian brain as what its called. If you put your limbic area over the top of it two thumbs serve to be a perfect model, the limbic area is very important for five functions we're just mention briefly here but developmentally we need to know it's partially developed at birth. So, it's gonna respond to experience as well as genes and epigenetic controls, epigenesis is the, the none DNA molecule sitting on the DNA that control gene expression. Gene expression means the production of proteins and for nervous system when neurons are firing they can lead to gene expression. So epigenetic control is very important. So interestingly epigenetic regulation of gene expression changes at the onset of adolescence. It's really fascinating we're just learning about it. So, it's like a whole new period of, of, uhm, transformation of the brain because of the expression of genes and how your epigenetic molecules may have been shape in the first 12 years of life and also what you may have inherited from your ancestors epigenetically as well as your genes as a predisposition to self-regulation problems. All sort of things can emerge as you'll see soon. So you have epigenetics and genetics determining the connections, the third big that determines connections after you're born specially and you have little bit before is experience. So genes, the epigenetic control of genes and experience or the three things we need to know as parents or as adolescence or as mental health professional or anybody those are the three big forces that work to determine the connectivity of the neurons and the reason that's important is connectivity determines what emerges and imparted to terms how you think, how you feel or how you pay attention, how you interact with others it determines everything. So connectivity it's not just it's interesting, it's vital to everything. Okay, so the connective of the limbic area is partially developed at birth. And the, the-- this area immediate five different function I'll just mention it briefly but we'll get into them detailing a few moments they are just so you haven't listen it works with the brain stem. The limbic area works with the brain stem and the body to create emotion. So number is emotion. So what we say about the adolescent braining is this got this emotional spark where the body, the brain stem and the limbic area this below the cortex the higher part of the brain areas push upward on the way we think much more during adolescence than a childhood or even during adulthood. So this emotional intensity is one aspect of the change in the brain and it just-- we'll see why that's probably the case soon. So that has do the limbic, you know, ah, intensity that raises, so emotion. Number two motivation, the limbic area works with the brain stem to create our motivational states and there's a wonderful book by Jaak Panksepp in our, eh, in our personal neurobiology series I've overseeing the publication of 36 textbooks. One of those 36 text books is Jaak Panksepp's The Archeology of Mind that he wrote with Lucy Biven and if you wanna know more about the sub-cortical influences on motivation and emotion read that book. It's like 400 pages just about this one thing I just mentioned. Serious it's fascinating but-- I mean you got to be to wanna know that matter of detail. Uhm, but it's a beautiful book. Okay, so, so motivation, motivation changes during adolescence people says another myth. It's not exactly a myth but it's, uhm, like it's this kind of a myth that adolescence are lazy they're actually more motivated in many ways but the kind of worlds we create for them in school doesn't match the way the brain is changing. And besides being sleek deprive and fit-- and not fitting in and feeling frighten their future of the world and stress beyond their belief cuz we tell them that's important where they get into school because they have to get SET score cuz they have to get in great college, cuz you have to get into a great grave yard. Imagine that pressure like, "Oh, my God! The ultimate destination, where am I gonna be?" Uhm,-- so we call them in our culture lazy but the fact is there anything but lazy they're just-- there's a miss match going on. So that's a second thing absolutely changes not raging hormones is a change in the motivational system that we're talk about soon. The limbic area and brain stem specially. Okay, number three is something called appraisal. So now what we're viewing is the limbic function so we have emotion we have motivation the third thing is appraisal. Appraisal where we need for evaluating the significance and meaning of something. Of course that's gonna be embedded our collective narratives we tell but Don Meichenbaum beautifully talks about its gonna be all about what we're doing therapy that all of us talk about, uhm, this appraisal system changes in adolescence in ways that drive adults mad, right? Cuz they say, "Oh, this adolescent isn't listening to me." Well, you know there are appraisal system has a genetic push from millions of years of evolution not to listen to you as we'll see very soon. So the limbic area which is appraising the million things does a number of steps. It, it says, "Hey, this thing is important sort to orient attention. It's all about appraisal the first step appraisal is orient attention cuz I think this thing is worth while paying attention too. Which when I talk to middle school teachers they here this thing they start laughing, their heads go like, "Oh, my god! I have no idea how to connect with the limbic area of my students." And said, "Well let me teach you." Which what we do. So orienting is interesting, this is worth paying attention. Number two is once you orient it is to think good or bad that's called hedonic evaluation as a good or bad. This-- the third layer is once I say it's good how do I get more of it? Once I say it's bad so I get less of it. So clearly this is a thing that's involve also in what motivates. It's involve in your motions these were all interconnected things but it's the appraisal system that changes in adolescence in big ways. Number four, is memory. Memory is divide in all sorts of ways but the hippocampal here in the limbic areas was the amygdala and these are areas that convey different kinds of what I called implicit memory for the amygdala and exposit memory for the hippocampal integration. Ah, we won't talk much about that today but just know that, that changes as well. And finally the fifth thing that does change in a huge way so beside we've got the-- let's review emotion, motivation, appraisal and memory, the fifth thing is attachment. Attachment is basically something we have as 200-million-year-old area of the brain. It something we have from our vermilion history. We're very unique-- I mean I raise frogs at home, I raise fish they don't have attachment they can learn. They're really fun to have. I love having them in my life. They're-- I don't why but I should think about that but I do. My son once gave me this big frog as a statues I, I actually wonder about-- I'll have to ask him about that but, uhm, anyway this is reverse group therapy and so, ah,-- what was I talking about, attachment. So, uhm, so they don't have attachment but, but the dogs we have they have attachment, right. What attachment is this the young depend on the older wiser, kinder stronger individuals in their lives. Usually their parents, usually it's a mother. In fact for most mammals it's the mother. We have this unique position as human being where we don't have just the mother we have something to call hallow parenting it's Sarah Hardy, H-R-D-Y writes beautifully about in her book call mothers and others. It's very important because basically I bring that up here because our attachment means that we have the capacity to relate intimately and dependently on more than one person. A lot of the moms I see who believe it should just be them are going out of their minds and I tell them they're going against millions of years of evolution. That they should be sharing their care giving with trusted others. But they said, "No, it should be just me. No!" Actually human beings didn't evolve they have to be just one care giver that was not how we evolve. And the importance for this for our general understanding is mental health professionals is the collective child rearing made us collaborative made us have language. It made us have this thing I called mindsight where we had to understand each others minds and know how to trust each other know how to read each other signals. Know what the intention was the feelings, the beliefs the hopes how you could really be involve in lots of people's life and communicate about that. As far as we can tell we have a incredible complicity of all that because we share ca-- child rearing. So, it's just, oh, we share child-- no, that's actually the basis of our the nature who we are and as you'll see soon it influences adolescences. So what happens in the attachment system during adolescence is very simply. All these things were only get to the cortex in just a moment to the higher part of the brain but all these things we talk about so far how can we can understand why they're happening? Here's the way to think about it, the adolescent period instead of thinking it is raging hormones and immaturity and impulsive and lazy and all these kind of stuff you just got to get through all those myths which I wanna invite you to join the effort to debunk those myths in our culture cuz it's not gonna be one person. It's not gonna be one book it's gonna be a ground shrill of a movement to do this. Because watch if you just change the way you think about the adolescent period in the following the brain needs to be remodeled from the sponging up the knowledge of our culture through our relationships of our parents and our fears and our teachers and our communities we do zero to 12, that's basically with that period of, you know, infancy and toddlerhood and preschool life and elementary school. The way kids are they are sponges for everything. It's beautiful, it's fantastic. It's very, very, uhm, crucial for us as a very complex social creature but I want you to picture this, picture this setting. You've just had a really, really deep sleep and the sun is raising and the sun's rays or peaking through the windows and your eyes kind of gently begin to open and this person who loves you like crazy comes in and kisses you on the forehead and says, "Good morning, sweetie. So great to see you what would you like for breakfast?" And then he or she goes and makes you breakfast you get up and wash up and take off your pajamas put on your shoes for-- and clothes for preschool and you come and then they feed you delicious food and then you go off to school and you play. You learn to share you toys. You rest me-- you come home you have lunch. You take a nice deep nap. You then get up and one of your loving figures in your life who you trust more than anything dances around the house with you with some music and lets you watch some cartoons. And then you go play outside and, you know, you didn't come in they say, "Sweetie, what would you like for dinner?" And they make you dinner and you watch another TV show one of your favorites and then they put you in the bath and scrub you down ,give you little massage, sing you a song and read you a story, and you fall off to sleep. Now who in the same mindset would ever in the right mind leave that situation?

DAN SIEGEL Now I know a lot of spouses who are trying that to their spouses and that's a different talk. So think about it this way, you've got to have something much more than just raging hormones or something. You've got to have a remodeling of the brain that essentially addresses this issue of how this kid won't be leaving your house when he or she is 50 years old. I'm serious. So, on the individual level we think of adolescence now through the remodeling of the brain view as an adaptive period where your getting ready to adapt to the reality that you were gonna leave the nest. You're gonna leave that wonderful snugly home. Now obviously not every kid is snugly homes but in general that's the ideal set up. And to get ready to leave the home the brain is got to do a few fundamental things. It's got to change the way emotions drive thinking because if you just settle in for the same old memories of how it's been in the familiar forget it, right? So how's the brain gonna do that? It's gonna change your motivational system we've already talk about that. It's literally gonna die deep in to things that affect the limbic area and the brain stem as well as the body which is changing anyway because you're becoming sexually mature and all of the sexual hormones are raising. And then it's gonna take the, the final area that were in the cortex and bend your fingers over the top. This is called the neomammalian cortex or neocortex. All these are synonyms or cortex the outer part of the brain. And it, it when you're born it's fairly developed at all. It develops a lot in the first two years of life in certain areas mature a lot even by 7 years of age in the prefrontal region. It's always gonna be growing. It's always changing throughout the lifespan. Uhm, but what happens is the cortex which is involve in reasoning is gonna be influence along the limbic area and brain stem by a circuit that goes up and down and hits all three that you may have heard about. It's called the dopamine circuit. The dopamine circuit is the circuit of reward. And you've probably heard about it cuz you've heard that anything that gets you addicted involves dopamine. And two things are believe to happen and obviously there's scientist who fight about anything, you know, so these are always controversial but the general belief now is that the dopamine circuits change in adolescence in two ways. One, the base line level of dopamine that makes you feel like life is good and rewarding drops. The second thing is that the release amount become more intense and let's just think about in lymphatic way what that would mean if you're brain drops its baseline dopamine level and raised it's release level. It would mean you have a possibility-- not all adolescence go through this but a feeling a little restless I got to do something to get my dopamine going. It might mean you feel bored. Does anyone remember that in adolescence? It might feel like the same old, same old it's just not cutting it. It also means that one of the biggest things that release dopamine is novelty, so you will be driven to explore new things. It also means that at thrilling potentially dangerous activity becomes a draw because of its adrenaline rush and its dopamine squirting. So when we think about adolescence risk taking behavior we need to put in the context that the home that we just described where you made breakfast and all this kind of stuff is safe it's certain, it's familiar. For you to get out of the safe the certain and the familiar you got to have something change in your brain to get you to do what? Embrace the unsafe. Embrace the uncertain. Embrace the unfamiliar. Or you're just gonna be at home when you're 50 years old seriously. So what nature has done is change the dopamine circuits and the way they relate to the brain stem, the way they're relate to the limbic area and the way they're relate to the cortex where ultimately what the cortex is all about is making maps, the back of the brain maps out the three dimensional word. The side of the brain of the brain maps out the sound world. The upper part of the brain maps-- maps out where the body begins and ends. And the front part of the brain allows to thinking more abstract ways. The front most part is called the prefrontal cortex and it's not that it's immature, it's just that it carries out and integrative function. Integration is the linking of differentiated areas, and basically the way the brain is changing which we're gonna describe right now is that it's going to integrate. It's gonna link differentiated parts in a very different way. So, it's not immature that's just not accurate. We need to stop saying that because if an adolescent hears it they will act immature and it's really an necessary way it be. If you understand that the differentiation is changing and the linkage is changing cuz that's what the remodeling is you'll understand that it's a transformation of what the prefrontal cortex is required to do. So let's review what happens in the brain at its most basic. We said that the brain isn't immature, it's remodeling. What is that mean? All of us leaving this room tonight today should go away with the following knowledge. Remodeling is what the brain is doing during adolescence and at last a good dozen years in at least the American culture seems to be taking over the world but in our culture it's what's happening. What is remodeling consist of, it consist of two processes. One, is called pruning. Pruning is where you take existing neuro-connections and even sometimes neurons themselves and you destroy them, you get rid of them. You prune them away like a garden, you clip them away, you shave them down. Whatever wor-- works for you but literally people were shock to find this. When they started looking under the skull of sequencing adolescence, healthy adolescence across the lifespan they found this pruning process that is absolutely we believe genetically programed to happen. The second process that's happens, is called Myelination. Myelin, M-Y-E-L-I-N is the conducting sheath that allows the remaining neuro-connections to become well much faster and much more coordinate in balance why is that just so you know you don't need to remember when it about so say but those no-- like to know the details. The action potential, the ions floating in and out of the member which is what we mean when say, "Neural Activation", the action potential among myelinated neurons is 100 times faster, that's really cool. The second thing is when you're myelinated the resting period you are required to do after you fired off, call the refractory period it's 30 times shorter. So 30 times shorter refractory period combine with the 100 times faster passage of the ions down the axon makes for what' 30 times 100? Come on, math isn't that hard. Oh, what was it in mathematics? Three thousand times, your neurons are 3000 times more effective, let's just use it that way. So this isn't just the speed what this pruning in myelination does. The pruning allows for areas to become more differentiated the myelination makes for things become more linked. So the intimate goal of remodeling is massively increase integration of the brain, you need to have both differentiation which pruning allows otherwise you're just a bunch of interconnecting neurons without much differentiation. You differentiate and then with pruning you link with myelination and you're more coordinate in balance. You literally can become more integrated through the remodeling process. I-- and the, and the whole thing is more created in balance so believe it or not, adolescence can do things incredibly more efficiently than a younger kid. Cuz their brains are much more integrated they're much more myelinated. However, the pruning process we need to know and adult mean changes puts in certain risks. What I'm gonna do is go over these risks now and then we're gonna talk about the essence of adolescence of what it means for how we approach things base on what we just learn. So the over all proposal here is that the adolescent period is not a mature period of adaptation it's getting you ready to go out in the world for an individual the reason that's so important is I get ready to leave home. Set up my own home base for the culture the human family, this is an incredibly important point. For the human family-- bless you. Let-- let's have a bless you for everyone who's gonna sneeze. For the human family, for the human family what this means is that as adults, you know, you learn how to do something, we settle in, we're taking responsibility in raising kids. We're having a job we wanna just come home, relax, watch TV whatever we do and we do and we settle into a status quo and we do our thing but the world is forever changing so from a human family point of view if nature did not, did, did not build in to the human brains remodeling. A capacity for this brain to only get ready for the individually of home but actually for allowed this generation to take on a new world and say, "I will not do it the way the adults have done it." And if they didn't have that kind of courage and that kind of creativity we would not be the species we are. But in fact the reason we've been able to populate every corner of this planet and now we think maybe it's not such a good thing but we've done it. The reason we've been so quote, "Successful" at being ourselves I wanna propose to you is because of this adolescent period of life. And if you look at the fields of art, music, science even and technology the greatest innovations in those areas, art, music, technology and science have all come from the adolescent mind, which says, "I refuse to accept the status quo. I push against my parents. I push against my teachers, parent figures. I push against which handed me and I will think about this in the new way." And we as adults, as parents of course we feel rejected, they're turning toward their peers instead of their parents, they're, they're not taking what we said is the right way to do things. "Oh, my God! am I doing a bad job in my attachment work and all the stuff." It's understandable you feel that way than the book. At Brain Storm book I'm appealing as much of the parents as I am to the adolescence that's why I'm telling you it's so horrible it's so horrible to rate. Cuz every time I kinda spoke a little bit to the parents and to have the adolescent understand that. You know, speaking the adolescent I had the, the adult understand it. And I realize in the end and this what people said with the test readers for it was that it help them understand each other better. This is what I hope will happen if this goes out in the world. So what this view is that instead of seeing this push back it's a necessary adaptation for the individual and unnecessary adaptation of our species. So let's look at what the essence of what we just said in this. And for those of you who, you know, some of my other writings or talks or whatever, you know, I'm-- I have a little bit of a problem which is I'm an acronym addict. So we're gonna talk about an acronym that about the essence of adolescence in just a moment, but before I do what I'm gonna say is this, is when you look at this essence what I want you to think about as, as we go through it is how many of this four points ES will be one, SE will be another, N will be third, and CE will the fourth. So you can try it and guess what it is as we go. Spells the word essence that was the amazing thing as I was running, "Oh, my God! This spells and acronym. Who put that in there?" You know, uhm, when you look at the essence we're gonna look at the upsides and downsides of each of the four and then what I want you to do also is think about your life individually as an adult of their adolescence in the room as an adolescent and how this is playing out your own life. And what it means then we'll talk about that soon. Does make sense so far? Okay. So ES, we've already covered ES which is emotional spark, we've already said the changes in the limbic and brain stem of body inputs to the cortex create this emotional spark. Even to the point where we have studies adolescence and brain scans where if you show them a neutral-- a photograph of a neural face they think it's hostile. The emotions are so rip up, do you ever had that at home? I know for me I came home and I said to one of my teens, "Hi," they go, "What!" And I go, "I just said hello." "There, you're doing it again, dad!" And I had to say to myself knowing this study I guess they're preparing for anyone who might just randomly say hello to them or something. But knowing the be-- know the brain mechanisms you can at least calm yourself down a little bit as a parent and be present which is the, the book is divide to four parts, the final part is like, how do you really be present both as an adolescent and as a parent for all the changes and challenges of adolescence. The third part is actually about attachment and that was a hard part to write, you know, teaching both the adolescent or specially if they're teenager still living at home, how do you understand how this parents were in the ro-- next room? How the way they communicate when you shape your brain? And then for the adult reading there in the next room, you know, this is what your way of being has done to your child's brain and, uhm, it's never too late to course correct and making sense of your life makes a lot of sense to do. So it's an inside out approach for those in your parenting inside out. Okay, so there's that and then there this whole thing about, you know, this essence that we're talking about now and the structural things in the brain that we're talking about those in the four parts the essence, the brain, the attachment and how to stay present to the changes and challenges. And here's the, here's the issue for this essence then. We're gonna talk about the prose and the ups and the downs and, uhm, and I want you to think about how this in your life. And just wanna say before we get to that cuz I don't wanna forget this is very important as a statement to make at the end we're talking about remodeling in the brain. You know this fact but a lot of people don't know it and now we have a reason for the fact we believe as mental health professionals you know that the major psychiatric disorders of schizophrenia of manic depressive illness, bipolar illness, of obsessive compulsive disorder, uhm, of eating disorders, right. And all sorts of difficulties with identity, uhm, with the risk of suicide, uhm, with addiction of all sorts food addiction, including being addicted to high carbohydrate foods. Uhm, and also addiction to drugs and, and alcohol. Uhm, cigarettes, uhm, behaviors. Uhm, these things have their onset primarily across a-- across the board during the second dozen years of life, during adolescence. Why is that? Is there something we can do about it? The two big things that we believe are happening are number one, the pruning process may carve neurocircuitry, genetically in a healthy way but if you have risky circuits and to be resembled about it that if too few numbers during the preadolescent period, then when you carve them away. Let's say you're gonna carve, let's just to do the math in this, let's say you carve 50% of your neurons away. Let's say in your prefrontal region to regulate your limbic area and have emotional balance. Let's say you need 1000 neurons, okay? Let's most adolescence before they hit adolescence have let's say 4000 as they go in to the preadolescent period. You have 4000 you need 1000 so you're fine. Your inner adolescence you're gonna prune away half of them, what does that leave you with? Two thousand fine, you don't have a disorder. But let's say you start the preadolescent period with 1500, so you're find you only need a 1,000. But now what do you left with after adolescence? Seven-fifty you're not fine. Now not only you're not fine but we believe that the stress of having emotional dysregulation with the increase cortisol. Cortisol is neurotoxic, it's gonna kill even more neurons and increase pruning. So the stress of having a psychiatric disorder recursively, you know, reentry, reinforces the very disorder that is emerging the reason for early intervention being so important. Including with medications in some cases, you know, Stanford chicki-- uhm, ah, Chang-- Kiki Chang is saying we should use it as a prevented of measure. And that's his view, we should certainly use mind from this practices as prevented in measure for all kids. Because we believe that mind from this practices and I have them in the book actually teach how to keep the brain integrated. Keep it regulated, so my hope for this whole brain storm approach is that instead of doing what's we will have to do which is, you know, treatment and intervention let's work on prevention. Right. And we as a field are in the most important position to change the cultural conversation about adolescent which will be the most powerful preventative move we can make as a culture. I'm telling you so really, really. Well, after this talk in the afternoon I'm gonna be at the booth or mindsight and sto-- common if you have ideas about how to get involve come talk to use we'll be there. So here's the idea, here's the idea that you can have the pruning be exacerbated we can prevent that. Adult mean circuit change of course makes you at risk for addiction. That's just the truth of it. And exposing an adolescent brain to all sorts of substances and even activities can activate certain epigenetic changes that make it more likely to keep the addiction going. So we just need to be aware this is a vulnerable brain. A brain in transform formation is a brain that's vulnerable. But their interventions we can do like what I call the mindsight skill training which is mindsight those three things incite, empathy and integration. So throughout the book they're learning mindsight skills, incite, empathy and integration and how to keep their brains healthy, how to keep them integrated basically. It all involves the parent and the adolescent knowing what this is about and the adolescent choosing in their own motivational system to make this happen. So let's go through the essence right now. Emotional spark ES, the upside is your life has passion and energy and meaning the downside is you can have emotional roller coasters for sure. So learning to balance that, learning to let emotions have their 90 second time in the, in the sun and then let them float away. Is it the important emotion coaching, ah, that we hear about from the Gottmans what you can learn what you can learn with the heart math program. There are lots of ways of letting our emotional lives actually be comer, to remain coherent and how we approach emotions is very important. I see too many parents get reactive to their adolescence natural ups and downs of emotion which intensifies the issue. We can change that by understanding this. This is a mindsight skill so emotional spark gives life's passion. Number two, social engagement SE, social engagement is where adolescence are driven to their peers not their parent and there's an evolutionary reason for this because if they go out alone they'll be dead. So when you're adolescent come to you and says, "Mom or dad, I need to buy that kind of shoe, you know, that's what everybody else is wearing." It doesn't mean you have to buy the shoe but at least you can be emphatic with the incredible brain stems sense of fight and flight about it that you're gonna kill them if you don't let them buy the shoe. Because if they go out into the work they're dead, literally that's what they're brain is telling them. Now, what's the downside to that? The downside of course you can lose a lot of money buying those shoes. But the downside is they can cave the pure pressure of fears that maybe not so good for them. There's no questions fears influence development during this period in a huge way. It's that's an important issue being around peers who understand this. Now, I bet you if they all start reading The Brain Storm book they're gonna change their path. So, so this is the downside, what's the upside? They learn social skills the most powerful effect on our health. And we're doing this in a relations per-- relationships first, uhm, effort that you've heard about is relationships they promote medical health, mental health longevity, well-being all these things we now know. Relations to some point this where we learn to them and we hold on that social engagement. That's the positive side of it having a network of your supportive relationships. What's the end? Novelty, novelty seeking, we have a downside to that of course cuz we wanna thrilling things, we have new things. We feel restless. We feel bored. We got to do something we take risk. All right. All that stuff. So novelty is at done side but if we learn to approach it like waterfall, you know, you can't stop a waterfall but you can redirect and harness this energy. We need to approach the essence of adolescence with that same kind of attitude. Say, "Okay. I get it." You have a need for speed let's have you learn to do this. Let's have you go skiing. Let's have you be, ah, ah, cross country runner. Let's have you go drive a race car in a race car track instead what happen to me was one of my favorite professors was killed via 19-year-old going 95 miles an hour on a surface street. And I swore when my professor died and our sum was 1 year of age in her arms I said, "I'm gonna to figure out whatever I can so that we can raise our adolescence not to do without poor kid did." And I say poor kid because knowing that my professor died and it was sad for all of us knew him and his family. Sad for the person who was driving the car. His got to leave his whole life with that when someone could have tuned in to that novelty seeking and let the-- let them do that. So there's an upside too which is-- it finds new ways of doing things. And the creative explorations is literally the cortex is ready to think outside the box to think in expanded ways. To push against the status quo, to be creative and make new combinations of things. As we said innovation comes from this period of life. So when I say to middle school and high school teachers just an example, if you take this new understanding of adolescence and you were gonna design a curriculum this is what it would look life. It would like taking the essence, the emotional spark, the passion of adolescence, the social engagement that they can work collaboratively not competing what do we say, "Get a better SAT score in the person next to you so you can get advance." For what? For nothing. That stuff does nothing but make people stress out their minds with no positive benefit. So why not let them collaborate with each other which their social engagement circuitry is ready to do. Have novelty and creative exploration the following way you say, "Okay." Look, you're a middle schooler now, you're an adolescent what we're gonna do is we're gonna list the top seven problems in the world. You know, violence, famine pollution, climate change on and on you say you pick which one you have the most passion about. Find yourselves in groups and-- you know, I'm an adult I really can't tell you what to do, right? Cuz that's what their brains are program. You say, "But I will your consultant and you're gonna use your-- that passion that they have that social engagement look for new ways the novelty to creatively explore the CE ways of approaching this. And I will bet you-- in fact someone was telling me just the other day does actually program not knowing about the brain that did this and researcher show to works so I was so happy to hear them and it contact to go created it but that we now know you can actually approach this in a totally different way base on the brain science if we did this here's what the possibility is, instead of thinking their immature and we have just that to get through it adolescence themselves can capture this essence and I'll bet you if we collected the passion of this period of life instead of shoving it into some category where it's immature and impulsive. If we capture the collaborative capacity of this period of life instead of getting them to compete with each other let them compete with the world's problems. If they have an agg-- aggressive of competing strict beautiful capitalizing it let's beat the crap at the world's biggest challenges. And if we did this in a way where they can discover new things and we're opening instead of shoving this facts and them to say to get the score that score in some stupid test. If we actually taped in to their creative exploratory capacity I will bet you that some of the greatest problems which we all know as adults and we haven't been able to figure out how to help them. I'll bet you this adolescent group rising up to be the one who take over the world will have the courage and creativity to work collaboratively to actually make the kind of change and if we given the chance about this integrative capacities this mindsight abilities you know what the outcome of integration is that they can develop from the inside out and through our cultural support of them. It's kindness and compassion they can develop this is how I end the book and that's how I end this talk. They can develop an attitude where they can differentiate their separate selves and learn how to save our life and enjoy their bodies and enjoy their life and keep things healthy. But they can also learn that all of the science of relatedness shows over and over and over again the following fact that when we find ourselves in service of others we feel better, our bodies are healthier and our sense of wholeness begins to arise, so I say to them that we can save our life and we conserve life. And that's the way to leave in integrated life and the way I suggested is you have, that savers. A we that serves and together me and we make Mwe, MWE. And that's the kind of identity we can have because when that arises kindness and compassion are with the world can become feel good. Thank you so much for your attention.
