JOHN GOTTMAN  Thank you all for coming out tonight and braving this potential derecho storm that just missed us here in Washington, D.C. So it's always a pleasure to talk to people about the work that we do and I want to give you some idea of the history of this research. So 40 years ago, I was an Assistant Professor at Indiana University and I met he guy who is a best friend at our wedding, Julie and I were wedding 26 years ago, Bob Levenson, who is now a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. And Bob and I become friends right away, we -- you know, we love laughing together and laughing at ourselves mostly and we started having coffee once a week. And -- and our relationships, we found that with women were not going very well. So basically we were really two coolest guys about relationships. And -- and so we decided that since we didn't understand to have a good relationship with a woman, we might as well study it, you know. So -- so we -- so we built this lab that there was really a lot of fun, you know, we -- we brought couples into this lab and they -- one of the things -- one of the reasons we worked together was, Bob was a psychophysiologist, so we -- one of the -- both being interested in emotion and how emotion works in relationships. So we are looking at physiological part of emotions and we hook people up to the sensors that measured the electrocardiogram, how fast their blood was flowing, how much they were jiggling around in their chairs and how much they sweat from the eccrine glands or their palms, they are very -- those are glands that are very sensitive to psychological stimuli, we have them on our palms and the soles of our feet. And -- and then we had this computer that really -- the only job it did was synchronize the video time code to the psychophysiology. And it was about the size of three refrigerators, if you can imagine that, it does less than your cell phone does now, you know. But this was in the '70s, way before personal computers came out and -- and the -- the PDP-11 computer also collected all of the data. And we had couples come into this lab and after they've been apart for about eight hours and -- and they talked about how their day went and -- for about 15 minutes, and then we interviewed them about what they were arguing about and then we asked them to take the top problem in their relationship and resolve it in the next 15 minutes. And then we had them talk about a pleasant topic from a list we gave them. And then we showed them their video tapes and they turn this rating dial from very negative to very positive as they watch their tape to tell us what they were feeling, what their internal perception was sort of -- of what was going on. So we had physiology and we had behavior recorded on the video tape. Now at this time, interestingly enough and the early 70's, a guy named Walter Mischel, he written a book where he basically said the psychology was in a bad place, the best that psychologists can do a predicting behavior using the most refined personality measures all the time was accounting for about 9% of the variation -- 91% of the variation in human behavior was completely a mystery and what Mischel said was, that is pretty bad and unacceptable, we have to do better. And of course, we were getting evaluated for 10 year in promotion and our senior colleagues said, well, you guys are crazy to study a couple because if you can predict one person's behavior, how you're going to predict two peoples behavior, you're going to just square their ego and you will never find there anything. You'll never a grant, even if you get results that won't replicate this is crazy, don't do this research. So we decided to do the research, of course, we were curious about this. Now, let me give you some idea of where psychology was in couples therapy was at the time. So a book had come out called the Intimate Enemy, and it was written by this guy named Dr. George Bach, and what Dr. Bach suggested for couples therapy. He said the problem in marriages is that people suppress their anger and resentment. So this therapy consisted of having two partners face one another, and they would take turn and standing up and saying what they resented about their partner. And he actually gave them these foam-rubber bats that he marketed, called batacas and they would whack each other with. So I might stand up, if Julie and I were the clients I might stand up and whack her and say, I resent and I'm having enough sex and then I would sit down and she might stand up and say I resent, you are not helping enough in the house and then I would stand and we do this for an hour. And then we will write Dr. Bach a check, that was the therapy, it was a whole therapy. And after hundreds of studies people discovered that there is no kurtosis effect for anger, getting it out sort of Its not like clearing your throat because actually when you do that for an hour, you leave more resent although when you came in. So it really doesn't work. So there were lot of hypothesis about what made relationships work that was kind of floating around at that time in the 70's when we started doing this research. Another one was that, what went wrong in relationships, this guy suggested, his name was Don Jackson, he was very famous physiatrist, and he wrote this book called the Mirages of Marriage which is a wonderful title. And he said, what goes wrong is that in a good relationship there is an implicit contract that if I do something nice for Julie, she will reciprocate and do something nice for me. But in a relationship that hasn't going well that contract is violated. He called that the quid pro quo something for something in Latin. And so that was a whole therapy that really got started, behavioral psychologists started reciprocal contracting idea and people would have these contracts and I'm not making this up, this is really true. There was an article published that said this was a very successful therapy because the couple made a contract that he would take out the garbage Friday morning and exchange for getting fellatio Friday night and that was -- that was the therapy, you know. So you have to be too sensitive to see that, maybe that therapist is missing the barlow bed, and all about what's wrong with their relationship. And in fact in 1977, a guy named Bernard Murstein published a paper and which he said and discovered that this quid pro quo way of thinking and might getting -- I'm giving a lot and I'm not getting a lot back that way of thinking was actually characteristic of ailing relationships, not good relationships, and ailing friendships, not only ailing marriages. So we will not become emotional accountants until things go bad. Now all these books had been written by therapists and therapists of course see couples who are in trouble, right. So they have to imagine what a great relationship look like, looks like. But Bob and I were studying really good relationships and we don't really expect to find very much. We just sorted, we'll be really interesting to see what we learned and we found, when we contacted the couples three years later and found that how happy they were and how they have changed in their happiness. Some couples had really dropped in marital happiness during that three year period. Some that increased, some had stayed the same. But mostly they really either increased or decreased and we found we could predict whether they would go one way or the other, now with 9% accuracy but with 90% accuracy. So this was really, I mean, we were probably the most surprised about their result and anybody. I still remember the phone call, when Bob called me up and in those days there was one computer at every university, nobody had a computer and you would -- it will take you hours to get results and you bring these big heavy IBO -- IBM cards to a window. So when Bob got the results he called me up and said, have you ever gotten results like this? And I said never. So we were pretty excited because what we found was that the couples whose relationships got more miserable overtime regardless of how happy they were when they started had blood that was flowing faster, heart rates were beating faster, there was sweating more and jiggling around more. So that being clam when you are talking about a conflict was a good thing, in fact we found that, when we recorded the video tapes about what they were saying then in fact Dr. Bach was completely wrong. The mask as a relationships rather than hearing resentment we are very gentle with one and another they were kind, they were considerate, right. And in fact the first thing we looked up was how many seconds did the couple spend during a conflict discussion or even when they talked about how did they went, how many seconds did they spend being nice to each other, being interested one and another, being kind, being respectful, being empathetic, laughing together, being affectionate all the positives stuff divided by how many seconds that they spend being hustle, angry, disappointed her, confronting one another. And we found that the couples whose relationships got better, that ratio of positive to negative. Even though in conflict, averaged five -- five times as much positive is negative in relationships they got better over time. And the relationships they got worse over time, that ratio of positive to negative was 0.8, just a little more negativity than positivity, still a lot of positivity, almost because it was balanced. So we realized that for a relationship to really feel good and to get happy overtime, it has to be a very rich climate, how people being nice to each other, just the opposite what Dr. Bach was doing, alright. And when later on people also discovered the quid pro quo was wrong, people don't -- in relationships that are going well, don't give in order to receive, I'll just give it. And it kind of works out when you're being altruistic or positive. So that was the first thing we discovered, that ratio really was very interesting. Now, when I got to the University of Washington about 27 years ago, I built an apartment lab which was kind of like this lab that Bob and I built and Bob helped me build it. And -- but it was kind of design to be like a bed and breakfast getaways, it was on the medical school campus and there was a great picture window and boats were going by and there was a park and there were ducks and geese in the park. So it was a very nice setting, very beautiful setting. And the only difference between usual bread and breakfast and this one was that there were three cameras bolted to the wall and that follow all their movements and there were holter monitors that measure electrocardiogram and when they urinated we took urine sample to measure stress hormones and we took blood from them to look at the immune system and people were in other room recording their emotions, but aside from that it was a very relaxed sort of bread and breakfast kind of setting. And they spend 24 hours there we just had the cameras rolling, right. And -- so let me give you some idea, we did the study over and over again, that same study, in fact we not only studied heterosexual couples, but we also spent 12 years studying gay and lesbian committed couples. And we found the same thing, the same sets of things discriminated the master's of relationship from the disasters. And by disasters we mean people who breakup or stay together and they're really unhappy, but they stay together. So it is very important from a research point of view to be able to discriminate those three kinds of couples, happy couples, couples who stay together but are miserable and people who break up, divorce if they're married. And we can do that very well with very high accuracy. So not only that this ratio predict, but then we kind of asked about are all negative things equally corrosive and what we discovered was really that the disasters present their problems and argue in a completely different way than the masters. And we were able to identify four things that were really different and I call them the four horsemen of the apocalypse and this is account to the New Testament revelations, there are four horsemen that accompany the destruction of the world, and there are things like pestilence, and famine and war. But in the case of couple's conversation, there was four things, first of all, well, how they started presenting a problem, and the disasters basically pointed their finger at their partner and said something like, you know I been watching you and as far as I can tell I am pretty much perfect, but you are defective and this relationship is not going to get happy until you get therapy and change. And they would have all these criticism and so about what was wrong with their partners character or personality. Now, the credit really expected that people would respond to this what they saw is constructive criticism by saying something like John, thank you so much for pointing out all the ways and which I am failing as human being. You are so intelligent, can we have launch next week and you can tell me all the other ways in which I'm a failure and that's what the critic kind of expected, but instead they got the second horsemen which was defensiveness, all right. So let me tell you what the masters did instead of presenting pointing their finger at their partner instead of that what the masters will do when they started to conflict discussion as they would start very gently. They point the at themselves and they say they minimize the problem and they something like this is kind of weird being in this psychology lab and having to say, we talk about our major conflict and because I don't really think there is a lot wrong with you or me or the relationship its really fine. But there is a one thing, you know another way here, and myself have a good conversation, so what the heck. I guess one thing that I would really like is when you come home from work you a put away the cell phone and the blackberry and the computer and you just hang out with me and ask me how many they was and that will be just great. So they were really pointing their finger at themselves and saying what they needed and it was lot easier to hear this sort of finger pointing and because defensiveness will be the next horsemen of the apocalypse and that was either a counter attack and say, you're not so perfect, let me tell you what you do wrong and that be an escalation of the criticism, even at bigger criticism. I don't balance the check, but well, I guess why, you are not a very good father like a really big one, really big criticism and it would escalate keep going like that right. Or the other way being defensive was to act like an innocent victim and why on sort of basically saying something like I can never do anything right with you, everything I do is wrong, I can never please you. I never get any acknowledgement or appreciation for what I do, that sort it feeling sorry if yourself kind of attitude. And some people were so good at defensiveness, they could combine the two, like being an innocent victim and counter attack as well the same time. Now with the masters that we're doing is something entirely different in defensiveness, even if their partners started with some criticism, they would say, yeah, it's interesting, that's a good point, you know maybe I was kind of grumpy that night, I really should put away myself on in my computer and hangout with you and you're right, I'm really -- work is getting underway, tell me more about what's bugging you about might being on the phone, because a lot of times I just only rejoice and they have this great conversation because they are taking responsibility even for a small part of the problem and its amazingly powerful, we've discovered that taking responsibility when your partner is upset and saying that's a good point, that's interesting, tell me more I want to understand why you are unhappy, why you're in pain right now, that's huge especially for men, when a women does that for a guy as opposed to saying the whole problem is you, when she says you know it's not all you, it's me it's you and we're busy, again, it's not our fault, but yeah, you know, I mean it's partly you, that's music to a guys ears especially because I always we feel like there we got nail kind of like a butterfly getting pinned to a coat board, they are the ones the most terrifying thing a guy can hear the seven words, we need to talk about our relationship, right, and that's the last thing a guy want to hear, once they hear. especially at night after work. So taking responsibility is very, very powerful and that's what the masters are doing, even when there is a bit of criticism. Now the third horsemen was what we call contempt and contempt is different from criticism, it's really like acting superior to your partner and if you think you are better than your partner in dimension like your more punctual, you are tidier, you're better informed about some topic, anything like that, you will speak down to your partner, and which would comes out as usually an insult, or a put down, or some derogatory term. And its feels very appropriate at the moment to you use that term for your partner, but it actually turns out, that contempt is our best predictor of divorce in heterosexual couples. The master is basically don't do it is essentially zero for the masters. And it not only predicts the demise of relationships but it predicts how many infectious illness the recipient of contempt we'll have in the next four years. So the glazers at a high state university actually discovered among newlyweds that contempt and other codes that are sort of similar to it and the Mariett Lennar(ph) coding system was done in the University of Oregon that the couples that did a lot of that. When they took blood from them and looked at the white blood cells that in fact t lymphocytes didn't proliferate as well and response to an antigen and natural killer cells which sort of kind of our police force against tumors were in a cytotoxic, where it's able to kill tumors in the blood of these very young healthy people, newlyweds, when there was contempt and codes like contempt. So we know that, we know the mechanism by which is a degradation of the immune system. And in fact the couples will use contempt, the glazers found they secrete more adrenaline, while they are arguing and you can predict just from the amount of adrenaline in the blood during a conflict discussion, how that relationship is going to be 10 years later. So you start with newlyweds in the amount of the adrenaline and predicts, that -- it's going a bad relationship 10 years from now, it's not much adrenaline, you will be fine. It's secreting adrenaline, it's a very bad thing. So contempt is a very powerful thing. And it became one of my hobbies to start and collecting ways in which people contemptuous. One of my favorite was correcting somebody's grammar when they are angry with you, I think that's a really great way. So if Julie says I could care a less about that and we're in the middle of discussing a conflict, I guess, I would say, Julie, just a minute, it is not I could care a less, the proper way to say that is I couldn't care less, now what was your point? This is sort of the professor way of being contemptuous. And when we went to Kentucky we found that in Kentucky they have a particular way of being contemptuous, you can say anything written about another human being and Kentucky like you can say to your friend, look at that woman just came in, doesn't she realize, she looks like a slut in that dress bless your heart. So if you say bless your heart, you can say the most rotten thing about people in Kentucky, I don't know if that's true anywhere else in the South but -- it is, okay. So it is really interesting to see how different culture is our contemptuous, the French are really great at it. If you go to Paris, tell you are an American, you will receive French contempt or bring a baby to a bistro, poodle is our right but not a baby. And the British are very contemptuous, they do that in their paddle net they sort of mock each other and make fun of each other. So contempt became one of my hobbies and because it's so powerful that destroying the relationships. Now the masters were doing something entirely different, they were instead of contempt, they were doing something very complicated, they were creating in the relationship a culture of appreciation and respect and they were doing in a very small moments. They were basically -- I think the difference between the masters and the disasters here on this contempt to horsemen was that the masters had a different habit of mind, they were scanning their social environment and their families at home for things they could appreciate, the things they could -- they were trying to catch their partner doing something right and they will say thank you, and they would say in very small moments, I'd just say, I really enjoy the conversation at dinner, thanks for making the bed. Thanks for doing the dishes, that was a delicious meal, Paine, you are such a creative cook and they say stuff like that. You know that teacher conference we had last week, you know, that was amazing, the way you dealt with that teacher, she was such a battle-axe, she scared me. I felt like I was six years old, but you handled it so well. So the communicating admiration, pride and respect on their partner. And where is the disasters were scanning their social environment for other people's mistakes and commenting on them, constructively they thought, right. And they are doing that with their kids as well and we have started looking at parent, child in our action, the same people were -- when they tried to teach your kids something they wait for the kid to to make a mistake and then they go. That was wrong, you did wrong there, that was wrong. Let me tell what you needed to do, you need to fix that, you can act like that, whereas the masters, would teach their kids a very different way, they teach them something, give them a little bit information, wait for them to get something right, then they come and say, you're getting it, that's great. Let me give you a little more information and they stand back again. And in one case the performance of the kid went up and up and then the criticism case it just went down and down. So in general there is such things as constructive criticism. And yet our society really believes that this is characteristic of the intelligent person and we called logical thinking in our schools critical thinking, we don't call logical thinking, we want our kids to be critical thinkers. And we think that something goes around appreciating things in the world must be a complete idiot, right. It's only the intelligent person who is skeptical, right. So our society supports this negative habit of mind, but in fact research shows that the masters, the positive habit of mind actually those guys rather than seeing the world through rose collar glasses, they are actually seeing the world more accurately. So studies that have looked that how much positive interaction is going on between people when you have the partners doing that as well as the outside observers, it's the people who are happy with one and another who actually are the same as outside observers. Whereas unhappily married people miss 50% of the positivity just goes by, they don't notice it. So actually this positive habit of mind is not distorting reality, it's the negative habit of mind that's distorting reality. People look for other peoples mistakes, they find them everywhere, all right, and they feel like they are just perfect, I know the people are defective, very bad way to think because it winds up leaving you kind of irritable, but feeling superior to other people, okay, and that's the mistake of contempt. Now the fourth horsemen of the apocalypse was something we called stonewalling and we what saw in the masters where we can get a few white people talk to each other, you will notice that the listener usually and this is true in a lot of cultures in the world is doing a whole lot of things to show the speakers that he or she has tracking the speaker. They keep their bodies open, they maintain an eye contact, they nod their heads, they move their facial muscles, they order these localizations, yeah, could be, oh, yeah, alright wow, okay, okay, yeah. But the stonewaller doesn't do that. Stonewaller -- none of that is there. They fold their arms like this look away down, no facial movement, no vocalization, no head nodding, okay. Now the person's stonewall really looks like they disapprove of what you're saying when you are speaker. so what happens is that when you look at couples interaction somebody starts stonewalling, the speaker does a whole bunch of things and when they try to repair, I say come on and trying to say come on back, come on -- you know come on, don't say really things is not so bad, really relax everything is okay or the other thing they do is they say it themselves, that 10 pound cannon ball was just not working, let's try the 25 pound and they escalate their negativity, right. I am still not getting through, okay, let's try a bigger load and so the conflict escalates. Stonewalling is really not effective in doing anything. Now, we're really interested in this stonewalling because in heterosexual couples, 85% of the time stonewallers were guys. This seem to be a guy thing to do. So Bob and I really wanted to know if we study lesbians to lesbians stonewall or is just a kind of a male thing to do. No lesbian stonewall, absolutely, okay. So we didn't really understand what's stonewalling was about. But then we found that an elevated heart rate above 100 beats of minute, increased ability to predict stonewalling in the next 10 seconds, okay. So stonewalling must have something to do itself soothing. And we started, okay, we'll go back to our subjects, we will bring them in, we'll show them the tape and we'll say what are you thinking in this moment and they could tell you what they were thinking really clearly. And this is kind of what's going through the mind of a guy whose is stonewalling, okay, just shut up, don't say anything, it will make you worse, every time you say something you make it worse, just keep your mouth shut, how long can she go on like this, woman is going to give herself a heart attack. I can say something now what happens 6 years ago, God, never forget that thing, don't say anything, you'll just make it worse, keep your mouth shut, its 10 minutes to the game, she can't touch me then. That's what going on in the mind of a stonewaller, it's a kind of self soothing monologue like cool out, don't make it worse, you'll just groove in it. You never know what to say to please her and the masters what they are doing when they get psychology around it is very different. What they do a lot of times is they do -- what this one guy we saw on the tape, they were talking about his being late all the time and his wife is kind of telling him, you know, I really think the reason you're late all the times because your mother left you waiting for hours when you were a kid and he starts getting really upset, yeah, I think you are right, I really hated her or him, boy that was a tough as a kid and you're starting to stutter a little bit and you see as heart rate go up out of control run rate and then this guy says what about those shoes and she says well, there weren't an expensive shoes and she says no, but they are shoes, really nice shoes. Yeah, thank you. Well, are you going to wear those shoes to the dinner party, so we can, I thought it might. So we have something to go with them. No. Why you should get something to go with him and his heart rate is coming down as he is doing this, right. And then after a while he says, so that might be late and he gets back to it with a lower heart rate, alright. He hangs in there and -- or another tapes the partner kind of sees them or sees her getting psychologically or else may she is getting red or she is getting upset or she is stonewalling a little bit and he just cracks her out and he says something that makes her laugh or she says something that makes him laugh and when they are laughing together the heart rate goes down. So that's what the masters are doing there, controlling heart rate and humor is one of the most powerful things that control heart rate. So let me summarize, so we can predict and this was 23 years of research, we can predict. And we weren't helping anybody, alright. And we are getting paid by our universities to watch people deteriorate and all of them getting good salary and we actually found in our data that if people got therapy they were more likely to break up and if they got no therapy at all, so we were kind of scare to help anybody. And but then 17 years ago Julie and I wanted to do, and she said why don't we team up and form an institute and lets really try to help people with this research you got, and I said I don't really want to help anybody. I'm doing okay and I don't want to be like all those guys they tried and failed but she said I think we should help people. So we had two different points of view and so we compromise and decided to help people and that's sort of the way how marriage works. I mean we actually had this big conflict about whether or not to get a dog and I just -- I was scared of dogs, I didn't like dogs and Julie grown up with Welsh corgis and she loved dogs and I said absolutely no dog, we are not getting the dog and she said absolutely we're getting a dog. So we discussed it intimately and for hours and years, years and we comprised and got a dog. And the first dog we got, you know, I lost my fear of dogs and now the dog we have, Colby, the corgi, he and I our buddies. And that's the way things are working in our marriage. Now, so we decided we are going to help people and the first thing we needed to do in order to do that was to take all these predictions and try to create a theory, a theory that could be disconfirmed, not the theory like psycho analysis that just live forever regardless of the data, but one we could modify over time, because like one thing we discover was humor was so important and reducing psychological arousal and predicting good things in relationships. So how do you use that to help people, can you say to a couple, the next time you talk about his mother, you know, that awful argument you had, he tried to laugh his smile more next time, it just doesn't work right. They're going to say you don't know his mother, she is not funny, right. So how do you get people laugh and smile more when they're in middle of argument and we needed a theory for that and Julie is going to tell you about that theory.

JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Alrighty. So you see our theory on these two screens and you know what was really, really easy to create a theory, all we needed to do was look at the masters. You know, we definitely didn't look at our marriage, you know, we weren't one of those kind of voodoo type couples that just say, well, we have the truth, so we will give you the truth. Instead what we did is we learned everything from the couples that we were watching, the real masters of relationships. So let me tell you a little bit about our theory, we call it the Sound Relationship House. And I will start at the bottom and build up. So when we looked at the real masters, here were some of the things that they were exceptional at. Number one, the bottom level, they built love maps. Now what the heck is a love map? When you think about how to get from point A to point B, you've got to figure out what are the landmarks, how do you get there? And you are asking a question how do I get from point A to point B? Well, how do you get from partner A to partner B? How do you build knowledge of your partner's internal world? Because that's part of the foundation of a good relationship. You have to know who your partner is. How do you find that out? You need to ask questions. So we call that building love maps. So when you think about -- you know, if you are in relationship, how well do you know your partner? Do you know your partner's most embarrassing moment in childhood? Do you know your partner's favorite novel? Do you know your partner's favorite music group or composer? You have to ask questions. And the cool thing about relationships is that over time the questions have different answers, because we evolve, we change, we mature, we develop, we have kids, that changes all the answers to everything in the world. You know, what's your favorite novel? I don't know. I haven't read one in 12 years, right. So you have to keep asking those questions. One of the ways that John and I tried to practice that was when we were living in Seattle, there was this beautiful, beautiful hotel and we couldn't afford, of course, to do very much in the beginning, and this particular hotel had the most beautiful lobby, it had the stone fireplace, it had a beautiful couch in front of it, lights were low, you know, it was so romantic. So we on a date night would go in there and we would sit on the couch and we would pretend we were guests. And we would order like a glass of wine and we would sip the one glass of wine all night, you know, which was cheap. And we would ask each other questions, like, you know, what are you thinking about your next research project? Or, you know, if you could do anything to our house, what -- how would you change it? Or what kind of traits from your family would you like our daughter to inherit? You know, these wonderful big open-ended questions, and those questions were so moving, you know, we could -- we could talk about one question all night long. And when we went on those days, of course, John brought his yellow notepads and he'd be like taking notes, right. And then he would code the answers later, so I have to be very careful, you know, what did I say, let's see. So building love maps is really key. And when we looked at the disasters, let me give me one example in terms of love maps. We had one couple who came through the lab, this was amazing, they'd been married for about -- I don't know, about 12 years. They'd moved into a new house three years ago. And the husband was a neonatologist, so he studied premature babies and he took care of premature babies, you know, who sometimes could be very ill. So he was at the hospital, sometimes 20 hours a day. So three years they'd lived in their new house, he didn't know where the back door was. He only came in and out the front door. He didn't know the name of the family dog that they'd had for two years. Did he know the names of his kid's best friends? Not a chance, you know. There is a couple who is so emotionally disengaged. They don't know each other at all. They are two very isolated and lonely human beings. So it's that building of connection through asking each other questions, that's a really fundamental part of the foundation of what creates a good relationship, right. Okay. So if we move up to the next level, it's called sharing fondness and admiration. So what do we mean by that? Well, you know, hopefully, we fall in love with our partners, we really see so much good in them, we really love their characteristics and so on. Now, the question is, does it come out of your mouth? You know, there is the story of the guy from Minnesota, who loved his wife so much for 27 years, he almost told her. So this doesn't work if you can't hold it inside your head, right. And just think it, or hold it inside your hands and hold your hands back, right. We can't do that and build a close relationship. So what's really important is letting our partners know that we love them, that they are beautiful to us, that we see their hearts and their hearts are the size of Ohio. That we admire how intelligent they are. We have to let our partners know what we see in them, the good we see in them and we have to do that every single day, it's really important to do that. Another part of sharing fondness and admiration is also sharing appreciation. So you know, there is -- how many times, for example, has one of you in a relationship in cooking dinner, every night, for how many months, for how many years, right. Sometimes decades. How many times do you hear, God, that was good, thank you. We need to hear that all the time. So we need to hear appreciation. One of the things that I love about John, I totally love this, this is like if you want a good relationship, just tell your partner to do this. Every morning he empties the dishwasher, every morning he makes coffee, what else do you need? Especially if you live in Seattle, you have to have coffee, right. So, you know, it's so wonderful that he does that and I try and thank him for that, you know, as often as I can. Even though he already knows I'm grateful, I give him a little more gratitude. So that's part of building a good strong base for your relationship. So let's move up to the third level, it's called turning towards versus away. So this one is just amazing, it is so easy to change. This we saw in the apartment lab. We were trying to figure out, you know, couples were not necessarily fighting when they were 24 hours in the apartment lab. They might be -- you know, one would be doing the dishes, one would be reading the newspaper, watching TV. So what was it that was differentiating the disasters from the masters? Well, here is what it would like. See if you can figure out which one works. So one of them would be looking out the big picture window, at the beautiful, you know, creek going by or the water going by and there'd be a boat out there, kind of sailing by. And one partner would say, ah, wow, look at that boat. The partner might do the following; reading their book or the partner might do this. Would you stop interrupting me? I'm trying to read. Or the partner might do, huh, which do you think works? Huh is the one that works. That's all it takes, it's so simple. So what we mean by turning toward versus turning away or turning against is that when one person makes a bid for a connection, like, wow, look at that beautiful boat or hey, George, I want to show you something, or honey, could you help me here. If the partner chooses to turn towards the other and I'm not just talking, you know, like physically turn their body, but just say okay, or sure, what do you need? Any way of responding to the partner's bid for attention or the partner's request with a response is turning towards. And then there is the enthusiastic turning towards, which is, ah, that is an incredible boat, wouldn't it be so cool to get a boat like that and sail around the world, God, when can you retire? So that's an enthusiastic turning toward, right. So turning toward is so fundamentally important. So let me give you a little example. John talks about this sometimes. There is a book out there that's called 1001 ways of being romantic. And number 24, on page 24, the suggestion is, give your partner a gold locket with your picture in it. So imagine giving a partner this beautiful locket with your picture in it, only you haven't asked your partner a question in 15 years. And when your partner is at a party and she starts to tell a story, you say, oh, honey, don't tell that story, you don't tell it very well, let me do it. And when your partner asks you to please pick up the dry cleaning. No, I'm too busy. And then you give her a gold locket with your picture in it, what is she going to feel? What is she going to think, right? She is going to take the SUV, put the thing on the driveway and drive over it a few times, kind of smash it down into the cement. So, you know, you don't have the foundation for romance, for passion unless you have these first three levels of the Sound Relationship House. So they create friendship, not only that, but these three levels also correlate very, very highly to good passion, romance and sex in the relationship. So it's very difficult to maintain romance and passion unless those three levels are strong. Does that make sense? 

00:45:50
 Yeah. 

00:45:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN To you? Yeah, okay, all right. So let's move up to the next level, you'll see it's called the positive perspective versus the negative perspective. So let me tell you something about that. If people have either had a very, very distant relationship for sometime or they've had horrible, horrible fights where there's been lots of criticism and lots of contempt and defensiveness over and over and over and over and over again, what ends up happening is people may move into the negative perspective with each other, which means that they assume their partner is going to be attacking them. They assume their partner doesn't care about them. They assume their partner is critical of them, no matter what the partner says. We call that the negative perspective. You know, it's almost like in the relationship, there is a filter between each of the partners. There is a filter over their eyes and when the negative perspective is there, that -- that filter really is grey, it -- it makes the person only see a negative feeling in the relationship. They don't see the positive, they see the negative versus the positive perspective, which is when that friendship is operating well and conflict is being managed well, then what you see is that people will give each other the benefit of the doubt. So if somebody is really, really grumpy and comes downstairs and they're grumpy and they say, God, this kitchen is a mess again. The other person when they are in the positive perspective may say, uh, to himself, oh, oh, she must have had a bad night of sleep. Well, I understand I'll just step back just a little bit. And hopefully she'll get a good night sleep tonight, that's the positive perspective, right. But when you're in the negative perspective, somebody comes downstairs in a decent mood and says, honey, would you mind cleaning up the kitchen this morning before you go to work? Stop, trying to control me. Wo, negative perspective. Does that make sense? Yeah. Now the positive perspective and the negative perspective, you cannot work on directly. You can't tell a couple be more positive or be more negative, you have to work on either those first three levels or the top levels in order to change that perspective. So what's kind of where the Sound Relationship House kind of folds in half right there, it's affected by both what's below it and what's above it. So let's move up, you see manage conflict. Now, one of the things that came out in John's research was just an amazing finding and most people feel relieved about this, so there is kind of a sigh as they hear it. 69% of all problems in relationships in marriages are unsolvable. They are perpetual, they will never ever go away, they will never change, oh my God. They're based on differences in personality or differences in preferred lifestyle, right. So one person may be as in our relationship, you know, John calls me obsessively, compulsively neurotic, meaning, I mean tidy. And he is charmingly sloppy. You know, so that will be our perpetual issue forever and ever and ever. And there was one amazing family therapist, he really started the field, the family therapy called Salvador Minuchin and he said, "Every marriage is a mistake." Oh, oh, does that doom us? No. It depends on what you do with the mistake, right, what you do with it, how you handle it. So 69% of all problems are perpetual problems, they never go away. Now when we studied couples who are having conflicts, you know, as they were having conflicts, we noticed there were a number of different skills that they applied when they were real masters of relationship, even when they were talking about big perpetual issues that just were driving them nuts. So one of the things is, they would use what's called softened start-up. So they wouldn't bring up, as John was pointing out, they wouldn't bring up the problem with the criticism, they would bring it up in this way. I feel something, I feel upset, stressed, I feel angry, I feel worried, I feel desperate, I feel enraged. You know, they might feel really angry. That was okay, anger wasn't the problem. I feel about what, wouldn't be about who, it would be about what. I'm angry that there is a dent in the car. I'm upset that the bills haven't been paid. I'm really worried that our daughter isn't getting picked up on time. So they would name about what as just kind of the fact of something as opposed to again, as John said, pointing the finger and blaming, I'm upset that you are such an idiot. You know, you can cheat on this stuff too, do it perfectly. I feel that you are really lazy. You know, that doesn't work, that doesn't work, right. So they get away from you, I feel what emotion and then about what, what situation. Finally step three, they would say, I need or would you please, which was so important. We Americans, of course, are so autonomous and independent that we don't have any needs, right, except that we actually do, because we are pack animals. We depend on each other, that's our reality. So it's okay to have needs. There is no such thing as too needy, no such thing. People have fundamental needs. They need to feel connected to each other. They need to be able to lean on each other. They need to ask for what they want from each other. So here's what people would say instead of -- let's -- let's -- let me give you a situation, let's say that your mother-in-law is coming over for dinner tonight, right and she always finds something to criticize with you. You know, she may wipe her finger along the windowsill, oh my God, there is dust, uh, you know, or she might not like your cooking, something like that. So you really want your partner to stand by you, if she starts getting critical. Alright, so here's a nice harsh way to bring it up. Dear, you know, your mother is a wart on the back of humanity. Okay, that -- that's really going to make you want to listen, right. I don't think so. Instead you might say something like, honey, I'm really worried about your mom coming over tonight because she might be critical, would you please stand by me? If she does that again, would you please stick up for me? So you are telling your partner what you need in order to help your partner shine for you. Your partner needs to know what to do, your partner can't read your mind. So when we saw the couples who did that and this was amazing, the first three minutes of a conflict conversation predicted not only how the rest of the conversation would go, but with 90% accuracy it predicted how the relationship would be five years down the road. The first three minutes of a conflict conversation, wasn't that incredible? So it's incredibly important to be able to get it right, you know, to be able to say, I feel about what I need, okay. So that was one of the skills. Another one was that, you know, of course, nobody is perfect, nobody is perfect. We always make mistakes. We will get critical. We've had a terrible day. You know, we may call our partner an asshole or something. You know, I mean we make mistakes all the time in relationships. So it's not that the masters didn't make mistakes, the difference is that they repaired them. They went back to their partner later and said something like, you know what, I just was in a terrible space and I am so sorry, I said those words to you. What did it make you feel when I said them? So they would make a repair of times when they had regrettable incidents or they hurt each other. Now, you know, in our institute we've created a method, this is all part of our marital therapy and couple therapy, we've created a method that really takes from what those masters did in how to repair the regrettable incidents. So it's not that we avoid making regrettable incidents or hurting our partners, it's that people go back and repair them, those were the masters, they go back and repair them, okay. Another one is that couples would accept influence from each other, so they would say, okay, fair enough or okay, good point. Or yeah, I can see where that makes some sense instead of constantly contradicting their partner, trying to win the argument or get her -- you know, I'm the one who is right, you are wrong. That's the greatest kind of crevasse that couples fall into, when they're having a conflict is they try to prove that the other person's wrong and they are right. And therefore they win, but what are they winning? They are losing their connection to their partner. They may win the argument, but they lose their connection and their closeness. So the partners that were really accepting influence from each other were the ones who really stayed close over the long haul. When couples had a perpetual problem or what do you do with that, the -- the masters were able to dialog about it. They would keep just talking about it over time and they might make little temporary compromises. So let me give you an example, you know, with John and I in terms of me being a little tidier, maybe just a bit and John not tidy, okay. So, you know, one of the things with my wonderful man is that he really takes on a lot of projects, which means a lot of papers, a lot of books and you know they start spreading, right. They spread from the desk and they go into the living room and the dining room and the kitchen and the counter and up in the bedroom and they are like, you know, they are like up the stairs. They are kind of, you know, they choo. So we've created this beautiful system is, this is always going to be a problem, right. So I can tolerate the growth of the papers and the books for about three weeks and after three weeks, I start -- you know, I start going crazy. And I will very gently say, John, I can stand it anymore. Would you please clean up all these papers, please? And he'll go, okay and he'll accept influence. Isn't that wonderful? And then he'll clean them all up and for about 24 hours I'll have this beautiful house, clear of clutter, it's so wonderful and then they'll start to build up again. You know, so I'm building up my threshold. So it's every three weeks, it used to be every other day, now I'm up to three weeks. So, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm getting healthy, right. So, you know, with perpetual problems, you have to develop systems like that. So you make little temporary compromises around the edges, but you don't escalate into what we call gridlock conflict. Gridlock conflict is when couples are so opposed to each other that they get angrier and angrier, they get more and more contemptuous until they just explode. Finally, they may agree to just never talk about it again, but there it sits in the middle of the living room and they're kind of walking quietly around it, right. It doesn't help to not talk about it. So when folks don't have the tools to be able to talk about things like big gridlock conflicts, then they get avoided eventually and then you are -- you know, you are distancing from one another. So, you know, part of really being able to build a strong relationship is being able to dialog about those big problems and that takes us to the next level, which is called make life dreams come true. One of the things, this was so coo, ah, I love this part that we saw in our couples, the real masters is that beneath their position on a gridlocked issue or a perpetual issue was oftentimes something very meaningful. It might be a piece of history that was so crucial to how they were thinking about raising their own children here and now. It might be an underlying dream that they had or an underlying purpose or goal that they had, that really fed the intensity of their position on the issue. The thing that was amazing about the masters is that they brought those out and they shared those. Let me give you an example. When I was working with couples in poverty, there was a couple, they were amazing, they were from Georgia, they were deep poor, deep poor. And he was very angry at her with how controlling she was. She was very controlling, kind of domineering in the relationship. And as they were trying to process, you know, can we shift the balance of power a little bit, she for the first time in about 17 years of being together, she told the following story. When she was six years old, she lived in a ground apartment on the ground floor and her father had abandoned the family when she was very, very little, she couldn't remember the father. And one night while she was sleeping in her bed, the father apparently brought a diamond cutter and cut a large hole in the window, moved the glass, came into the bedroom, took her out of her bed into his car and drove through the night and disappeared. And she was with this father for six months, while the mother desperately tried to find her. So as she was telling this story, you know, she is weeping, he is weeping, he is amazed that she never told him that before. And she said, I vowed to myself that I would never let anybody control me again, right. And then he understood, it didn't make it easier for him. He still wanted there to be some balance and once she told that story and he really empathized with her, she could relax a little bit that he really felt compassion for her and understood her need for control. So it wasn't about her just wanting to dominate him. It was -- it was about her not wanting to be totally out of control, which is what being out of control meant for her, being kidnapped and gone and separated from her mother at six years old. So you can imagine, right, you can imagine. So what we found is that couples with big gridlocked issues, when we slowed everything down and we had one person ask the other questions, specific questions like, is there any underlying history to your position on this issue? Or is there an underlying dream that you have some value in this, some value in your position on this issue? Do you have some deeper purpose or goal that's a part of your position on this issue? Wow, did we learn a lot? We learned a tremendous amount and these couples would soften their positions with conversations like that, where they didn't try to solve it, they didn't move fast into fixing it instead they sought to understand the partner first and to be understood themselves before they then moved into compromise. And that made compromise much easier. So honoring each other's dreams, making life dreams come true is part of what we work on within the conflicts that people have, as well as when people voice what their dreams are. So part of a really good relationship is sharing what is your underlying dream, what is it that you deeply yearn for. That's something that need to be communicated with each other. And if there is accepting influence, then you allow your partner to pursue their dream, you support them in pursuing their dream. So I'll give you a little tiny example of that and John is like my hero for this. When I was near 50 years old, I had the dream of -- and I'd had it for about eight years of going to Mount Everest Base Camp, I really want to do that. And I love high altitude, I love mountain climbing. So that was my dream. Now, John doesn't like to go anywhere that doesn't have room service and it's really hard to get room service at 19,000 feet, you just can't do it right. I mean and his first response, of course, is are you crazy, are you nuts? You know, why do you want to do that for? So I -- there was the important question. What do you want to do that for? And then he listened, it wasn't just a rhetorical comment, he really listened and I poured my heart out to him and by the end of it, we compromised and I went, right. And he took care of our daughter for four weeks while I went. So you want to talk about honoring a dream. Isn't that fabulous? So, you know, he was magnificent in terms of honoring my dream and I've tried to honor his dreams too. And now a dog is part of his dream. Isn't that cool? I think that's just so cool, it's wonderful. Okay. Now, let's go up to the top level, creating shared meaning. Now, one of the things that we've also seen in couples and remember, the couples that John studied were farming couples in Indiana, you know, they were just, you know, poor couples, middle-class couples, all kinds of couples from all over the country that he was studying. And one of the things that he found that was so magnificent is that every person is a philosopher, no matter what their education, no matter what their frigging IQ is, every person is a philosopher. We are meaning makers. We are meaning makers. And part of what we saw in our couples who were real successes in their relationship is that they created shared meaning, they shared with each other underlying -- their underlying purpose for being alive. Their underlying sense of what it means to be a human being, why am I alive today? There was an amazing psychiatrist named Viktor Frankl. How many of you have heard of him? Yea, cool. So Viktor Frankl, as you know, was Jewish. He was in concentration camps during the war. He was in Dachau for three years. And one of the things that he found in talking to lots of people in Dachau is that the people who survived better were the ones who had a sense of meaning and purpose for staying alive. And it wasn't just, you know, to feed themselves. It usually involved wanting to reconnect with somebody else. So everyone is a meaning maker and the important thing is that in relationships, people need to share with one another what is important to them, what's at the heart, at the core of who they are. What's most meaningful, what legacy do they want to leave behind when they're gone? How many of you know the answer to that for your partner? So asking questions like that, having a discussion with your partners about, so why are you alive? What do you want to leave behind when you're gone? What would you like your eulogy to say, what's your purpose for the next 10 years? So that kind of sense of meaning is what couples really who were strong, who were connected shared with each other. They didn't have to have the same values, they just had to support their partner's right to live by those values. Does that make sense? Yeah, okay, alright. So that's our theory, those are the strengths and now, we're going to talk just a little bit more with John about trust and commitment. 

01:10:30
[sil.] 

01:10:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Okay. So on -- take a step back, are we saying that anybody who does those seven things, any two people who do those seven things with one another can have a great relationship? And I don't think it's true. I don't think you can take any two people and do this and have a successful relationship. Really what we discovered in creating those two walls are of the Sound Relationship House, the one that says trust on the left and the one that says commitment on the right really came from understanding that love has really three stages to it. Now, the first stage, you know, what happens, a lot of the times it doesn't happen at some cultures where, you know, people arrange marriages. But in our culture, you know, people fall in love and that initial stage, you know, when you meet somebody and you really -- you really find them right and they smell right and taste right and feel right in your arms and they look great and you -- you just have great conversations and there is those wonderful falling in love thing that psychologists call limerence and people, you know, really get excited and obsessed with their partner. And there is a whole bunch of neurotransmitters and hormones that are involved in that stage that are very selective. It doesn't really happen to just anybody, very, very selective and dopamine is secreted and oxytocin and testosterone and -- and one of the things about this phase, even though it's wonderful, is that it's characterized by very bad judgment. We ignore a lot of the red flags during this falling in love phase. A second phase that happens and this is what we saw in our newlyweds in the beginning of relationships, this is when most of the fighting takes place in a relationship is the first couple of years when you are building that relationship. All of the arguments that those couples had were about trust. Can I trust you? Will you be there for me if I'm upset? Am I more important than your mother, than your friends? Will you earn money for our family? Will you be a good father? Will you continue to be sexually faithful to me? Will you keep attracting when I'm -- when I'm 64, like the Beatles song? You know, will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm 64? Those kinds of questions. That's what the arguments were about. Now, some couples really built that trust and some couples really failed to do that and -- and then there is a third phase to love and the third phase is really not about trust, it's about building commitment. And I want to tell you one little story about commitment, which really came out with this couple I was -- I was working with clinically. And this -- I was their sixth couple's therapist and, of course, I thought, you know, I'm going to be great, the other six had failed. But you know the five have failed, but I'm going to be really terrific. And we were working together and one day this couple came in and they said, husband said, this is our last session, we're done, you know, so they were going to fire me. And I said, well, we have a 24-hour cancellation policy, so you've already paid for this session. Would you please do me a favor and stay for the session and let me understand why my therapy has failed with you? I just -- you know, I feel I owe that to myself and if you're willing to stay, I would really appreciate it. They said okay. So we talked about an argument they had that week. And this was the argument. They went to a party. Now the -- now, this couple had two young kids, a three-year-old and a five-year-old. And the wife was a therapist and she had stopped working as much, so she could really take care of the kids. And husband had a career that was really going well. And they were getting more and more distant from each other over time with these two children. And they went to a party that week and husband said, yeah, you know what happened, I was talking to this woman at the party and I was really having a great conversation with her and I found her very attractive, too. And my wife tapped me on the shoulder and she said, I'm tired, I want to go home. I was really mad about that. I really -- I didn't want to go home, I wanted to keep talking to this woman and on the drive home he said to her, you know, I found that woman a lot more attractive sexually than I find you. His wife found that kind of upsetting. And so they had a big argument, right. And I said to her, what were you thinking during that argument? And she said, what I was thinking was who needs his crap. I wish I were with a more mature guy, this guy is just still really immature. So I said, okay, thank you very much. Now, I understand why my therapy failed and why those other five therapists failed, you can -- you can go now. And they said, what do you mean we can go now? I said, well, you know, you're -- you know, you're done with this therapy and now I understand why therapy doesn't work for you guys. So you can leave. I get it, you know. And they said, well, can you tell us? I said, oh, okay, sure, you know, I'd be happy to tell you. You know, I mean the thing is you guys, yeah, you have a house together and you have children together and, you know, you are married, but you're actually not married, you actually never made the commitment. They said, what do you mean? We made a commitment, we had wedding vows and, you know, we -- I said, yeah, right, you know, but let me try to explain what -- what commitment's about. You know, the best way I can explain it is, you know, in the story Alice in Wonderland, you know that story? They said, yeah, we know that story. I said, well, you know, Alice, when sees the white rabbit go down the rabbit hole, that leads to Wonderland. She doesn't look over the hole and say, God, I don't know if I want to go down this hole. It might get my dress dirty, maybe tomorrow will be a better rabbit. She just jumps in the rabbit hole, that's her journey. I mean, she is committed. She -- you don't have any choice, you know. She is going to Wonderland and it's not all that great there. I mean, there's the red queen that cuts her head off, you know. There's great stuff too, the Cheshire Cat, you know, and the Mad Hatter, but that's her journey. And you guys, this isn't your journey. You are always looking around for something better, you know. You are at a party talking to an interesting person, you think maybe I should be with that person. Yeah, you are not in this relationship, you never married this person. And when you get an argument, you know, you, your wife are thinking, ah, who needs this crap, I can do better with a more mature man, he's immature, you know. So you know, yeah, you trust each other, you've done a lot of things together, you've had children together, you bought a house together, but there's no commitment in this relationship and there is no therapist that can help you unless there is commitment. And -- and they left and a couple of months later, I call -- I call them up and I said, well, how are you guys? And they said, well, we were pretty rocked by what you said and they were in therapy with their seventh therapist working on commitment, okay. Commitment is really about the third phase of love. It's about what makes love last a lifetime. It's about really saying this is my journey and this is the person I'm going to love forever and the love is going to be very personal. And I am going to keep cherishing this person and the difference between cherishing and not being committed is when you cherish somebody, you really decide that you were going to really magnify in your mind the positive qualities, so that you nurture gratitude for what you have and betrayal and the opposite of commitment. And this couple was on the way to betrayal was really to be resentful for what you don't have and to start substituting in other relationships and other ways what you think is missing in the relationship, instead of bringing up with your partner what you are upset about and trying to get your needs met in this relationship. So that third phase really is also very selective. So not everybody falls in love and has that cascade of neurotransmitters in that falling in love phase. It's very selective. Not everybody builds trust, which is the wall on the left, the Sound Relationship House. That's the next filter. And not everybody builds loyalty and commitment, that's the third filter that makes love last a lifetime. Thank you very much for listening.

01:19:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Nice. 

01:19:40
JOHN GOTTMAN We'd be happy to take questions and there are two microphones. So if you have a question, please go to the microphone and then we can hear you. 

01:19:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Why don't we sit here, honey? 

01:19:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Especially Julie can hear. 

01:19:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Do you want to sit here? 

01:19:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, sure. I'll sit there. 

01:19:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay. See his accepting influence. It's good. So any questions? Yes. 

01:20:00
 Hi, thank you so much first. What happens when you have a disaster person with a master person? Is there such a thing? 

01:20:20
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Um, ah, I suppose you could say that. Somebody, for example, who expresses their needs who does so in a gentle way, et cetera and somebody else is being contemptuous and so on or critical. So, you know, it's a process of looking at what's going on between them, ah, what's happening with the person who "is a disaster" or is doing the wrong things that's keeping that person from turning towards the other person responding defensively, let's say, instead of just listening. So it's a matter of really trying to understand what's going on with that person who might be very walled off, very defended, et cetera. It may be that the person who looks like a master is being a master in front of you as the therapist, but is not a master at home. So you never know, right. So what you really have to look at is what's going on between the two, work on changing for both of them really, the ways of listening to one another, speaking to one another in terms of their needs and so on, we have you know lots of methods for that. And trying not to blame, you know, one of the big mistakes that therapists make is nailing that one, you are the one who is at fault. So when you start thinking like, well, you are a disaster, but you are a master, you're just even thinking that in your head. That can be dangerous because then you're blaming one person for what's wrong in the relationship and it's never that simple. 

01:22:10
JOHN GOTTMAN One of the things that we did in the course of building this theory was to create a mathematical model for couples interacting. And, you know, James Murray and I wrote a book with his students called the Mathematics of Marriage and one thing we looked at was just the kind of question you asked. You know, what happens if we have somebody who is just really kind of nasty and they -- and they start harshly, and you have another person who really, you know -- really is good at communication and it turns out that actually that kind of marriage can work very well, as long as the -- as long as the positive person acts as a enough of a buffer that you can tolerate a bit of negativity. But if the negativity grows, right, then it falls apart. So there you can actually precisely set how negative that disaster person has to be, it passes a certain threshold and then the relationship goes down the tubes. But if they don't go -- don't go down that threshold, the marriage is fine and there is a lot of research, for example, on -- on happy marriage where one person is very depressed and the other one turns out to be very nurture and very unique and it -- it can work very well. 

01:23:35
 Thank you. I guess I'm wondering what -- is the disaster master effect, is that a function of the relationship or the people in it, their skills or? 

01:23:45
JOHN GOTTMAN It's -- you know, it's a bit of both. 

01:23:45
 So in other words, would a disaster person that does disaster relationship, would one of the people do better with another person or are they going to be that way always? 

01:23:55
JOHN GOTTMAN You know, it's a bit of both. You know, for example, there is one gene that has been discovered in men, and if you have -- if a guy has one copy of the gene, he tends to be in a happy marriage. If he has two copies of the gene, he's in a conflicted marriage. If he has three copies of the gene, he is alone. So, you know, there is where biology comes in, you know, and oxy -- and some people make more oxytocin than other people, so they're more naturally bonding and personality traits, but you know people are more agreeable and more flexible on what's neurotic, they'll be better in any relationship. So it's a bit of both, it's a bit of the individual and it's also what happens when they're together as well. 

01:24:40
 Okay. So you would think that a disaster person might have a chance in another relationship? 

01:24:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Could be, yeah, it could happen. Yeah. 

01:24:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN You never know. 

01:24:50
JOHN GOTTMAN We've seen it happen. 

01:24:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yeah, you never know. I mean certainly one person may be a disaster because what, for example, they're really needing the other person to help financially support the family and the other person really wants to, let's say, stay home with the kids. And so, you know, that disaster is really a disaster because they are not getting their needs met, they are feeling tremendous pressure in order to, you know, provide for the family themselves alone and they really resent the other person's kind of taking the opportunity to be the stay at home parent when they too would like to be, you know, more involved with the kids. But, you know, so they are very angry about that and if things are not changing, even though that stay-at-home parent is very good at expressing their feelings and so on, but they are still not getting their needs met. You know, that's going to create a lot of anger, lot of resentment, criticism perhaps and blame. But if that person pairs with somebody else who really does want to financially provide as well as be a co-parent, et cetera then you know you could have a very different relationship. So, you know, there's all kinds of different scenarios you can think about. 

01:26:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, actually, you can exactly calculate the threshold, that -- which you should bail out of that relationship if you are the master. 

01:26:25
 You can? 

01:26:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yes. it's a little scary, but you know. 

01:26:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Mathematic. 

01:26:30
JOHN GOTTMAN The mathematic tells you. 

01:26:30
 Okay. Thank you very much. 

01:26:30
JOHN GOTTMAN  Sure. 

01:26:35
  I wish I had a nickel for every time I've heard this comment and usually it's when I'm meeting with one member of the couple individually. And the comment is, I still love her or him, I'm just not in love with her or him anymore. And, you know, you want to go through a whole book of, you know, the -- the hormones and all that telling them that, but that's not going to do any good. So I'm just wondering, do you get that and what do you do with it? 

01:27:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, we hear that all over the world from clinicians, you know, that question and what do you in that situation. We might have different answers. 

01:27:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN We have different answers. 

01:27:25
JOHN GOTTMAN We probably have different answers to that question. 

01:27:25
 Okay. 

01:27:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Go ahead, you start. 

01:27:25
JOHN GOTTMAN I'll -- I'll let the boss go first. 

01:27:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I thought you were going to start. 

01:27:30
JOHN GOTTMAN I'll let you go ahead. 

01:27:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN You've already started. 

01:27:30
JOHN GOTTMAN  You want me first? Okay. 

01:27:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Sure. 

01:27:35
JOHN GOTTMAN So on -- you know, part of what -- what you need to do when somebody is feeling that way, it's not -- it's easy to be glib, but there are lot of reasons why people don't feel in love anymore. And, of course, you know, nobody ever has that big cascade of all those hormones when you're falling in love that lasts. It really can't last, otherwise you know people would -- people would perish. You know, they can't live with that level of intensity, you know. I mean, it's nice for a little while and some people, you know, become addicted to it and they want to have it over and over again. And they never progress to the second phase, you know, of love. But really the second and third phases are really quite wonderful and there is a lot of -- there is still a lot of testosterone and oxytocin and dopamine as well in that. So you have to kind of understand what -- you know, what the story is. You have to be a little bit like Sherlock Homes and -- you know, and try to really solve the mystery, because it was there once, right. There was -- he was in love or she was in love and now they are no longer in love. They feel attached, but you know so what's the story of what happened. I remember one couple I saw where, you know, that was the wife's major complaint, it's often the husband's major complaint, the man's major complaint, but in this case the wife's major complaint and it was -- and what I discovered because we measure physiology during our assessment phase was that this woman's heart rate was at such a high level she was secreting adrenaline, her heart was pumping hard, pumping hard, she was at such a high state of anxiety and we measure this with, you know, the Symptom Checklist-90, Derogatis' scale. So she was way above cutouts. There was no way this woman could feel any desire because her physiology was being run at such a high level, she was so much in fight and flight, that there was no way this woman could enjoy a novel, you know, or you know savor in delight in a meal, you know. So there was a case where it was very clear that the anxiety had to come down, medication was very important in this, self-soothing, learning how to self-soothe it, biofeedback was very important. So you can't always say, well, this is the problem, right. But in most cases, that situation exists because people have not nurtured the romance in the relationship. They -- sex has become the last chore of the day. Life has become an infinite to-do list and the couples really don't take time for one another and really, you know, do things that, you know, are very romantic. And a lot of times people say, well, you know, you want to be spontaneous, you don't want to plan this. But during courtships where hardly spontaneous, we figure out what perfume we're going to wear or what cologne we're going to wear, what music we're going to have on, what candles we're going to light, you know, what -- what the meal is going to be, the seduction is planned and it's delicious, you know. And we can keep doing that throughout -- throughout the relationship, all three phases of love. You can keep that alive, you can keep playfulness alive, you can keep adventure alive, you can have getaways and dates and you know, really nurture romance. And some cultures do that, lot of Hispanic cultures do that as well. Keep it, make that a priority and talking about sex is a very important part of that as well. So if you do that, then love changes and you stay in love, but the three phases are all very different and I think the third phase is the best of all. That will be my answer. How would you answer it? 

01:31:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I would probably -- I think we're pretty much in line actually. 

01:31:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Wow! 

01:31:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I know it's a miracle, isn't it? 

01:31:35
JOHN GOTTMAN You never agree. 

01:31:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Well, first of all, you know, you -- you mentioned that you have an individual that you are seeing, and she is talking about or he is talking about the relationship. Well, first of all, you never know what's going on in a relationship when you're seeing an individual. You've got to see both people. 

01:31:55
JOHN GOTTMAN It's a good point, yeah. 

01:31:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Right. 

01:31:55
 (inaudible ) having sometime along with each? 

01:32:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Having sometime along with each, right okay, okay. So you know, typically I -- I always really want to ask, so what -- what does love mean and what does in love mean to you? A lot of times people will say that I still love him or her when actually they don't. They'll say it because they feel, you know, guilty about the loss of feeling and they are also a little worried about your judgment as a therapist. They want to be seen as a loving person, they don't want to be seen as a person who stops loving somebody, you know, what does that mean about them? And so, you know, you have to really explore, you know, what does it really mean that you love this person, what -- what is that? Well, we have shared history together, okay. We've raised kids together, okay. Well, what -- what does that leave you feeling about your partner, with your partner? You know, so you're asking questions like that and I really agree with you sweetie that, you know, typically people fall "out of love" because there has been so much turning away from each other. They haven't been making bids for connection, they haven't been really talking openly about what their needs are. They haven't been reaching for one another. Perhaps there has been some emotional injury in the relationship that has really hurt them big time and they've never processed it, they've just said, okay, the past is the past, I'll go on, but they've never recovered from those emotional injuries. Could have been one of them, you know, was very, very ill and the other one went to play golf instead of coming to the hospital. You know, things like that. So you really -- I start looking for those emotional injuries. When I hear somebody say, I don't love him anymore or I'm out of love, those emotional injuries lead people to pull back, withdraw, stop needing, feel resentful, feel unsafe and not trust. And you can't stay in love with somebody that you don't trust. 

01:34:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, how many times do you think that there is already an affair going on when you hear that? 

01:34:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I don't know. You know, I don't always think there is an affair. They may be thinking about just getting out, just getting, you know, it's not worth a trouble anymore, you know, especially women. So I'm not really sure. 

01:34:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:34:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:34:55
JOHN GOTTMAN I always suspect that maybe that's what's going. 

01:35:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN There might be. 

01:35:00
JOHN GOTTMAN That's a justification. 

01:35:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Okay. Okay. Yes? 

01:35:10
 Hi. You may have answered this with your emotional injury thing, but if you -- you were a couple that was together for five years and you recently split up because you -- you thought that you weren't going to make each other happy in the long run and now you recognize the four horsemen. Can you repair that relationship or is it best to just move forward? 

01:35:35
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN That's a great question. Did all of you hear that question? Yeah, okay. So should you just move forward or now that you realize the four horsemen were there, you know, should you try and repair it? It depends on what the partner wants, too, right. So if the partner is still longing for the relationship, you're missing parts of the relationship, you know, or that -- or somebody is missing parts of the relationship, there is still a kind of a wondering. The four horsemen can definitely be repaired, the emotional injuries that have occurred from the four horsemen can definitely be repaired, as long as both people want the repair. You know, one person can really want to make a repair, the other person has -- you know, I'm done, I don't want to repair anything, go away. So then, no matter how much you want to repair it, you know, you can't repair with one. You got to repair with two. So it -- doing repair work takes one person or both people actually being willing to accept some responsibility in most cases for what went wrong, kind of the pattern that evolved, the escalations that evolved in terms of the four horsemen. And both people need to be able to receive the repair the other person is making, right. Sometimes the emotional injury is so big that to receive the repair means making yourself vulnerable again and that feels very dangerous for a while. So sometimes the repairs have to take place in little baby steps, you know, until this -- you know as the safety increases, you know, from nothing to something more substantial, but that can take time, but it takes two. 

01:37:45
JOHN GOTTMAN We have seen quite a few couples who decided the divorce is just now working out and -- 

01:37:50
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN It's true. 

01:37:50
JOHN GOTTMAN And, you know, I get back together again and -- 

01:37:55
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Yep, they come to our workshops. 

01:37:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, so sometimes breakups don't work, you know and -- that was a bad choice and let's reconsider that. 

01:38:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I'm going back. 

01:38:05
JOHN GOTTMAN There needs to be a new relationship, you know, you build. 

01:38:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN And a fairest for that matter can also be repaired. You know, I mean, that's part of the work that we do with even -- we've even had one couple where the guy had 57 affairs that he could remember, three of them were he'd really been in love with the partner. He was, you know, big, super guy and traveled all over the world and had lots of people approach him for intimacy, shall we say. So, you know, I mean, and they repaired, they repaired their marriage, they built marriage number two, marriage number one was burn to the ground, you know, like Atlanta, Georgia. But number two, they could build and they did successfully. So gosh, you know, people are amazing at their own resilience and the desire to grow and to change and to want to love and that's what, you know, can create rebuilding of relationship. 

01:39:10
JOHN GOTTMAN And the triumph with hope over experience. 

01:39:15
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Ah, sweetie, hope over despaired only. Okay. 

01:39:20
 Hi. I have a question that has come in from an audience member who is seeing the webcast and they -- you just mentioned repair after infidelity. So that was their question is, how do you begin repair once there has been infidelity? 

01:39:40
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Alrighty. Well, first of all, the affair has -- have -- it has to have stopped. So you cannot repair a marriage or a committed relationship if the affair is ongoing, it's impossible. There's three people in the room, not two, so you know who you are relating to. It's a little bit tougher to heal infidelity when it's been lied about for a while. That means there is a double betrayal. You know, the affair is the first betrayal, lying about the affair is the second. So that's a little bit harder, but to repair it, we have a old method of doing so, we called it atonement, attunement, attachment. And in the atonement phase, what happens is, first of all, the individual who has been betrayed is suffering typically from post-traumatic stress disorder. They are hyper-vigilant, they are terrified of it happening again, so they are constantly looking for it to happen again. They are having horrible intrusive thoughts of what the affair partner was like in bed or something like that. Coming into their head whether they want them there or not, those thoughts are coming into their head and some of the time they are emotionally numb, other times they are exploding. So no wonder it's such a roller coaster, right. So they need to, first of all, understand that that betrayed partner is suffering from PTSD and it's going to be a while before they can get over or at least tame down the symptoms of PTSD. Secondly, people who've had an affair need to kind of open up the wall of secrecy that has existed between them that's allowed the affair to happen. What that looks like is the betrayed person needs to be able to ask the other person lots and lots of questions about how it started, where, when, how much did you spend, things like that. So that person who's been betrayed needs to ask questions, the other person needs to answer the questions, also the person who's done the betraying needs to be able to hear the betrayed partner's emotions. And we're not talking about hearing criticism and contempt. 

01:42:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Right, right. 

01:42:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Right, we're talking about hearing the pain, the anger, the loss, the despair, the hopelessness, the rage, the tremendous fear that it will happen again. What is meant that other person without getting defensive. Then as that process unfolds and slowly kind of dwindles over time that may take a while. Then you can begin to look at how -- you know, how to really listen to each other, really attune to each other's needs, how to empathize with each other. How perhaps in the marriage, there were ways that both people were turning away from each other, not just maybe one, the one was doing some betraying with somebody else. So really attuning to each other means rebuilding ways of connecting with one another that have meaning. Finally, attachment really means making more commitment to the relationship and finding ways of creating even deeper safety, more trust, more commitment and ways of really connecting again that have the deepest meaning, where they really feel safe with one another. So all of that takes time. 

01:44:00
 Hey, two clarifications. First of all, when you were talking about stonewalling and you asked the guy what he was thinking in his head when he was stonewalling, did you mean that he was saying to himself just shut up? 

01:44:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Um-hmm. 

01:44:10
 Okay, alright. So -- so -- alright, so that makes a lot more sense to me. And then when he -- Julie, when you were just talking about, you know, a woman asking questions, for example, about when did this affair start, how much money did you spend. That brought up the question for me of, I've heard some therapists really feel strongly that it should not be about the details of the sexual relationship, it should not be about what did you do exactly and then what did you do because then you just have those pictures in your head. Would you agree with that? 

01:44:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN I totally agree with that, that is part of what we say. Yeah, so asking, it's a risk to ask deeper questions about the actual sexual acts they committed together, because it produces more images that intensify the PTSD and then plague that person. So we encourage folks to ask lots of questions, but not those. 

01:45:15
 Would you apply that same model to a couple coming together, where one has a history of being having affairs with past relationships, but the current relationship they're in there not having an affair at all and the person like (inaudible )I guess from past decisions? 

01:45:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN So what -- I'm not sure what you are asking. 

01:45:30
 So a couple coming together, there's been no infidelity or anything like that, but one partner is aware that the other partner has been -- has had affairs in the past like with past relationships. 

01:45:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN And so -- 

01:45:45
 And they are worried and they have trust issues. 

01:45:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN And they are worried. 

01:45:45
 Yeah. 

01:45:45
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN They are worried, they have trust issues. You know, that's kind of interesting. So yeah, certainly, there is going to be some questions about whether or not they can trust that person, if the person has a pattern of betrayal. So there may be a lot of testing going on, you know, in that relationship and one of the key things that the therapist might encourage the partner to ask, the one that they are afraid will have an affair is what went wrong in these relationships that you had affairs. And if he or she hears well, my partner was so immature or my partner was, you know, just sexually -- you know, she gained a lot of weight and so I wasn't attracted to her. You know, in other words, if that person is blaming the partner for the fact that he or she had affairs, that's a bad sign, right. Okay. 

01:46:50
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, you know, I would add one thing is that, the great that Shirley Glass did in the book she wrote called, "Not Just Friends" was to take this whole area of affairs and perception out of the pulpit, you know, out of the church and -- and take the horns and tails of people who do that, because they have that so often. And really to try to understand the process through which these things happen very, very frequently and part of, you know, what's hard to trust the person who has had affairs in the past is -- is really not understanding this whole process. So a lot of -- a lot of what you could do is really read Not Just Friends and you know -- and see what it is that Shirley Glass has discovered about the process is sort of how mundane it all is. You know, how people give each other permission to cross boundaries because they are afraid of bringing out conflict, they are afraid of conflict. Americans are afraid of conflict and you know in every affair, there is conflict avoidance and there is the failure of disclosing your unhappiness to your partner and trying to get your needs met in this relationship, okay, I don't want to rock the boat, you know. So a lot of this is very mundane, it's not because people are just fundamentally on trust where there are, they are evil people, there are some evil people. You know, but for the most part, I think, understanding the process is very important and then you can build the kind of relationship that doesn't have betrayal, that has commitment and loyalty, if you understand the process. 

01:48:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Good. One last question? 

01:48:30
 Yes, good evening. If you are doing premarital counseling, say, and you've got a wedding coming up in three months or you know they want six sessions so that their pastor will sign off and marry them. And if you see a potential train wreck is going to come out of this relationship, do you try to practice the tools to help them salvage the relationship? Do you help -- are you more honest and assertive with your feelings on this isn't going to go right, if maybe when I'm practicing alcohol, like, do you try to work on their -- their dysfunction? How would you -- how -- how would you roll with that type of activity? 

01:49:10
JOHN GOTTMAN I've had cases like that and I think, it's really helpful to be honest about the challenges that the relationship has. That you see, you know, being -- being a wiser person, you know, having more experience and you know, because when you are in that first phase, you really ignore those red flags and you know -- and they may not want to look at, they may want to think only about which band to have and what the wedding cake should look like, the honeymoon and think everything is going to work out okay. But I think, if you say to them, look, you know, you should be aware that these red flags that are going to come up, you're going to notice that and you know -- and leave the door open so that they can trust you and come back and see you and say, you know, pastor, you were right, a lot of these things had come up and we -- we don't know how to handle them, we need help, you know. I think that's what I would do. 

01:50:05
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Well, he's got six sessions, he said. So, you know, I agree with John that, you know, being honest is great and then seeing how do they want to proceed in terms of the five remaining sessions, you know, that they have. So if they really want to work on a relationship, if they want to work on change and they show that they want to work on change. By doing so, during those five sessions, you know, maybe especially if somebody is a practicing alcoholic, depending upon how long the couple has already been together, if the other person is not, then they are probably feeling quite a mask over their alcoholic partner's heart that they can't reach. 

01:50:55
JOHN GOTTMAN  True. 

01:51:00
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN You know, the alcohol prevents them from really deeply connecting with their partner and so they may already, if they've been together long enough before thinking about marriage, they may already feel some emotional distance and that perhaps really needs to be addressed in terms of the relationship and the fact that they are already starting to feel lonely. In order to see whether or not the other partner feels the alcohol is more important to them than connecting with their partner. And not that -- you know, I'm a firm believer and alcohol isn't being a disease and part of that disease is denial. So, you know, you might want to be with somebody who is a practicing alcoholic, really talking during those sessions about what that other partner is experiencing as their practicing alcoholic partner gets loaded every night or whenever. And also what's triggering the other person to turn towards the alcohol. What's going on for them that they reach for a drink. So, you know, exploring that as an issue might be a point. So on that wonderful note -- 

01:52:25
JOHN GOTTMAN With that, thank you for coming. Thank you for listening 

01:52:25
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN Thank you so much for coming. 

01:52:30
JOHN GOTTMAN A lot of fun. 

01:52:30
JULIE SCHWARTZ GOTTMAN It was great questions. Thank you very much.
