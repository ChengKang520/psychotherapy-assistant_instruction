Client's feedback on the session

UNKNOWN I had the counselling session with Barry a few months ago and I actually got a lot out of it and Barry contacted me not too long, um… and asked me to get some feedback, so here's some of my thoughts. 

00:00:35
How did you find the session? 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN I really enjoyed my counselling session with Barry, um… and it was a little bit of a surprise me 'cause I was feeling quite ambivalent about going, um… but it was yeah… I experience such quality attention for like 50 minutes I think that was really great. I also felt really safe in the counselling room and that really helped me to open up and, um… well, speak my truth really and as soon as I walked in the counselling, I felt ease, um… Barry was just really, really kind and open, um… yeah, I have just felt really comfortable. 

00:01:30
Did you feel heard? 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN I felt really heard by Barry, um… because it felt like I was blame on at times, um… but then he was able to come back, back to me, um… with some of the key points, um… though I was saying even if I didn't realize that they were the key points, we were able to really sort of concentrate on them and look at and that really helped me feel less confused. 

00:02:00
Did you experience empathy? 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN It felt as though Barry, um… genuinely cared in the session, um… his expressions were empathic and, um… and he had good eye contact and his tone of voice was, um… more caring really and, um… that helped me to open up more, um… especially when we're talking about things that were difficult. 

00:02:40
Did you find the session useful? 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN I found the counselling session really useful, um… because it's not often that I'm able to speak out loud about my internal world and, um… be able to speak to a professional, um… about it and really make sense of something's been quite confusing for a while and, yeah, that I've been playing over in my mind quite a lot, so that was really, really useful. Um… I also, I also enjoyed talking to a man actually because it's not often I get the opportunity to speak to a man about such things, such private things in great detail than really be listened to. 

00:03:25
What did you get from the session? 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN I got a lot from the session, um… with Barry. One of the themes that was coming up was about, um… my destructive nature towards myself, um… which has been a pattern in my life and, um… so it's really good to focus on that and talk about it because after the session and for a quite bit of time after I really did make a decision to be more compassionate towards myself and, um… I'm more caring and over time I saw how I was able to be less destructive in my everyday life instead of going out and spending loads of money or going out drinking, um… because I had felt a year union that was something that I was worried about, so, um… yeah, that was really useful and I really took that away from the session.
