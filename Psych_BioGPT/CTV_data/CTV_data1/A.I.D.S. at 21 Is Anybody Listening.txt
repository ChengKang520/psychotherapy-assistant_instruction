BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
 We are in a health crisis; actually this is a health emergency in the African-American Community. 

00:00:05
 I don’t care who you are, how rich or poor, what’s the color of your skin is, you’re at risk and we want to have the conversation with you. 

00:00:10
 This is a dangerous game. 

00:00:10
 Don’t rely when somebody, tells you because their statistics just came out from the CDC. That says that one out of every eight young gay or homosexual black kids don’t know they are positive.

AT 21 

00:00:25
NARRATOR A.I.D.S. At 21 the specter of an epidemic. In June of 2001, the CDC released a reports stating that number one killer of black man 15 to 29 was the HIV AIDS virus. 

00:00:45
 It has now reached epidemic proportions in the black community as well as the Hispanic community. 

00:00:55
NARRATOR Why is this happening now when so many minority men are breaking barriers?. 

00:00:55
 All this information we have and yet somehow we’re not using either right or not good, getting it that to the people who really need it. 

00:01:05
 HIV and AIDS doesn’t kill you, it’s the opportunistic infections that come behind having HIV and AIDS. 

00:01:10
NARRATOR And how is this affecting minority woman?. 

00:01:15
 I knew that if you put yourself at risk one percent of the time, you put yourself at risk 100 percent at a time. 

00:01:25
NARRATOR Experts and host of fresh voices explore these questions in the search for answers. 

00:01:30
 I don’t believe that we survived the middle passage and slavery and Jim Crow and the LAPD to only die from HIV and AIDS.

VOLANDA A lot of people when they look at these statistics and these stereo types about HIV and who gets infected they don’t see themselves when they look in the mirror.

SHERYL JOHNSON 

00:01:55
HIV/AIDS Activist ATL 

00:01:55
SHERYL JOHNSON He was 13 years younger then I was. We began a relationship that neither one of us thought would be long term, but we began to enjoy each others company so much that we just kind of fell in with each other. I noticed immediately that he seem to have a lot of gay friends, I saw gay men who were around and I asked him. I said, you know, do you have a sexual proclivity for gay men, or you know, why are there so many gay men around you. His answer to me was, oh, you know, I’m just hustling them. 

00:02:30
NARRATOR Sheryl Johnson contracted the HIV virus from a man who never revealed his true sexual identity. 

00:02:35
SHERYL JOHNSON I didn’t know what was wrong with me, I just knew that I had lost my energy, I lost my appetite, I dropped 20 pounds in the month, I started breaking out with something allover my body. I went to my doctor, who was also a friend of my mine, I said look, you know, I don’t know what this is, well, let’s find out what it is and he was like okay. So, we’re going to test you for everything, he gave me an HIV test, it was negative. He said he finally diagnosing with something called Epstein Barr Virus. He said Sheryl; I want you to understand that the Epstein Barr Virus maybe masking positive HIV results.

00:03:30
ANTONNE MOORE I think that we live in very difficult times. I think that for a lot of women the availability of man in their community particularly black women, there’s this perception that they aren’t any man and to a certain extent that’s very true. 

00:03:45
SHERYL JOHNSON Well it changed my life needless to say because everything in my life is before diagnosis or after diagnosis.

WILBERT JORDAN The direct behavior pattern of young women is best described by giving you data from my clinic, of the women in my clinic. 98 percent are infected heterosexually by a man. 

00:04:10
 To live on a DL men that you lie, you create a mask that is something who you are not; it’s something when you will always have a women in your life. It’s the lifestyle that creates a behavior of deceit, it’s a lifestyle that puts women at risk because a lot of DL men, the majority of the men I’ve interviewed don’t practice safer sex because we don’t feel that the virus Izuvas will come at us, it’s a white gay disease.

00:04:45
SEAN LESANE The basis for Down Low, at least for me the underlying issue is that there is a sense that the community is not supportive and there is a sense of safety that is not there. So, people think that they have to hide. 

00:04:55
 We need to be very careful about the way in which gay and bisexual are men demonized as being the reason why the spread of HIV is occurring within women . You know far too often, you know, society puts that message out, you know, subtly and even sometime overtly and you know, when I get those messages I’m offended because it doesn’t take into account the homophobia that exists in the society.

00:05:30
JOHN PETERSON The community intervention trial for youth, the city project is a major study that I’m involved in with several other principal investigators focused on developing and evaluating a HIV risk reduction intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior among young men who have sex with men. 

00:05:50
SPEAKER 4 We might get this wrong message that, oh, I can have sex with him without a condom, he must love me more and we must be closer, we must have a better relationship. You know in reality 9 times out of 10 that’s not true . The reality is he is positive and he doesn’t know it and he said he wasn’t, now you are both positive, and you know what, a year from now or a couple of weeks from now he’s not there anymore, and now you stuck dealing with this disease and the consequences in the pills and stigma, and the secrets. 

00:06:20
SHERYL JOHNSON For the most part in the African-American men that I have met, they’re not conscious enough about their health that they want even approach the subject of HIV and AIDS . They don’t want to deal with it, they don’t want to discuss it, they still in this teenage don’t want to wear condoms. They had never even heard of Dental Dams, they don’t know what they are or what they’re for. But, that to me is the scariest part of this whole crisis is the fact that, the virus is perpetuated by people’s ignorance, and by the fact that they prefer to remain ignorant than get educated and then protect themselves. 

00:07:05
METRO TEENS 

00:07:05
Washington. D.C. 

00:07:05
 When we get out, it’s going to be like up there, so people that we come in contact with could have aids. So, we just don’t even know, we talk to them like a regular person, but as soon as they tell us they have AIDS, we are like ‘oh’ you know. 

00:07:15
ADAM TENNER 

00:07:15
Washington. D.C. 

00:07:15
ADAM TENNER  Metro TeenAIDS was started in 1998 by a group of doctors and other staff from children’s hospital, Children’s National Medical Center here in DC. What they found was that they saw increasing numbers of young people with HIV coming into the clinic, there were no support services for them, and there was also not enough education happening in the school. 

00:07:40
 15: I mean, it’s not that big thing that they’re not at risk, but everybody don’t pop up the teenagers, these are things to do, you know, I’m saying, I could go to the movies why should I get tested. Go to the movies, you know what I’m saying. I mean, it’s just like that sometimes, you could make it (inaudible) and assess it but never end up making a day. . 

00:07:55
 Some people, like most people don’t do that because they’re scared, they don’t like to see one of their friends outside the clinic. Will somebody see him go inside of it and they go end up, when back to the school I am yeah, guess what, so and so was in the clinic, or they got HIV, say something, it’s on a whole school, but it don’t be true, you know, and does not make you scary 

00:08:15
 But you shouldn’t worry about what your friends say you should do it because you do as long as you are keeping yourself clean, keeping yourself up and everything. 

00:08:20
ADAM TENNER Even 10 years, you know, young people awareness are having these kind of frank discussions, where it didn’t necessarily know people who are effected by HIV weren’t necessarily talking openly about going to get tested and trying to reduce the stigma and shame around HIV. So, you know, I’m hopeful, but we have a long way to go and a lot of work to do and really we’re reliant on to these young people to make sure that we get there. 

00:08:45
 To really get deeper to really communicate with them, we need to have young people who speak in their language, who identify with their problems, who can communicate things on a much deeper level than we can to the other young people. 

00:09:00
CLAYTON

MONTEFIORE ADOLESCENT 

00:09:00
AIDS Program NYC 

00:09:00
CLAYTON It’s just like I’m talking to you right now, we keep it how we call a gully with them because that’s exactly how they understand it. They’re not all this technical, blah, blah, blah that they’ll hear a doctor say or a social worker say. They’re like okay plain English and when they mean plain English that means slang English to us. And when we come of as slang English that’s the one way that we get to another barrier, which is communication. 

00:09:25
 The trust first starts with me. Can I trust myself enough to make sure that I do as much as I can to be responsible in my sexual activities and also require that of potential sexual partner? So that is the way I try to talk with the young ladies as to their responsibility and their trust and faith and responsibility to self. 

00:09:50
 I’m not really sexually active at the movement because of AIDS and because I’m really scared of it and I know the high percentage of –lot people that are carrying it and how common it is among just the black community. So that’s one of the bigger things on my mind. 

00:10:05
Young People 15-24

Living with HIV/AIDS

Will Increase

00:10:05
To 21.5 Million in 2010 

00:10:05
 It’s very easy to say that the only answer is abstinence, the ideal answer is abstinence. Whether abstinence is the only answer, I think that’s the question. 

00:10:20
 We’re not in the same ages we used to be and you know, just engaging sexually with somebody else doesn’t just mean it’s an act of pleasure anymore, it can really mean, you know, risking your life. So, a choice that you make when you are 15, 16 years old can affect how long you actually live and that’s scary.

NARRATOR While medical science searches for answers, rationalist organizations are out there on the front lines in the struggle. 

00:10:50
NANCY MAHON God’s Love We Deliver is dedicated to delivering food and nutritional services to people who are living with AIDS and other serious illnesses and we serve 1100 people, five days a week and we serve them two meals a day. And when we deliver to parents who are living with HIV and AIDS, we also deliver to the kids. AIDS like any other serious illness is a family illness and you realize that one of either a parent or a child is living with AIDS then the entire family is living with that illness and coping with that illness. 

00:11:20
ANTONNE MOORE The African-American AIDS Policy and Training Institute is the only black can take in the United States around HIV and AIDS . Its mission, our mission is to mobilize black institutions around the fight of HIV and AIDS. We’re looking for community folks, people who work in the community, know their community very well. And so we get anonymous response from people who want to learn about the treatment and science of HIV and they want to learn it well. 

00:11:45
PERNESSA SEELE At the Balm in Gilead our mission is to mobilize the African-American church to address HIV AIDS. We want every black church in America to have an AIDS ministry to become responsive agent to the epidemic in the black community. 

00:12:05
SORAYA ELCOCK At the core of Harlem United’s mission statement is that we are here to provide 100 percent access to care looking for zero percent disparities for people living with HIV AIDS. 

00:12:15
BISHOP KENNETH ULMER There’s a network of pastors and churches in California that myself and several others of us are involved in and trying to facilitate the transfer of information out of and between the medical community and the church and religious community.

& Infectious Diseases/NIH. D.C. 

00:12:55
ANTHONY FAUCI This is still a major challenge for researchers in this field to figure out a way to keep the virus under control without necessarily having everybody be on drugs every single day of their lives. Thus far that’s the only thing that we have for them, but because of the toxicities of the drugs and the fact that as time goes on some people, in fact many people become less and less able to tolerate the drug or the drug becomes useless because the virus develops resistance against it. Those are all the challenges of treating people, but ultimately the answer which I find to be the greatest challenge is the development of safe and effective vaccine for people who are in groups, risks groups where clearly they have a probability or reasonably high probability of getting exposed to HIV. 

00:13:45
JOHN PETERSON I think clearly that we are on our way to making some major advances in HIV prevention with minority men, but we need to have much more effort then we’ve been giving before. 

00:14:00
BERNARD HARRIS Now when people come in, they’re still concerned about are they going to die, but we know there’s treatment out there now. So, they’re less concerned about are they going to die and more concerned about how it’s this going to impact my quality of life, am I going to have side effects from the medications, because a lot of people are very concerned about side effects from the medications as are we. 

00:14:20
WILBERT JORDAN 

00:14:20
Infectious Disease Specialist. L.A. 

00:14:20
WILBERT JORDAN People who are so afraid of being seen because it is an HIV clinic. And I’m right now thinking about making it HIV and Hepatitis C Clinic just so if you come and someone sees you, you can say, well, I have Hepatitis C, I’m going in for that and feel comfortable. 

00:14:40
NANCY MORALES Having HIV, HIV or AIDS you’re at a greater risk of contracting Hepatitis C because your immune system is damaged, the immune system is weak. So, if you’re having unprotected sex, you know this is a disease, Hepatitis a disease just like other infections that’s somewhat HIV because of the immune system is easier to get. For me personally being co infected HIV and Hepatitis C, with Hepatitis C the symptoms have been worst then the ones for HIV.

DENISE PRIDE Sometimes you may not have symptoms for 10, 15 years. So, the earlier you know what your status is, the sooner you can go into treatment and feel better and suppress the virus from overtaking your body. 

00:15:35
WILBERT JORDAN If you’re positive I will see you. I can see you now when you’re healthy and make the job easier. Give us time to get you ready to take medicine, you then got to take as many medicines, you have more choices or I can see you when you get really sick and you have no choice.

00:16:20
DONNA FUTTERMAN I think the training and involving young people has not been that difficult they come in with a huge amount of passion, energy, willingness to learn and willingness to teach. They’re so eager to get out there and reach their peers. No one has given them that opportunity very often.

VOLANDA Someone without options is a very dangerous person. If you don’t give him any options, if you say your choice is this, all you are going to do is walk away and not take the condoms, not take the information, and guess what, it’ll be like I just wasted five minutes. 

00:17:15
JESSICA. R We also stress that whenever you are ready this is real important decision. This is a decision that can change our entire life. So, you know, we should take a time, think about it, but when you’re ready, this is the place where you could come and get tested. 

00:17:30
SHERYL JOHNSON To see me and to know that I’m as alive and active and looking good as the next person. If I didn’t tell you that I was HIV positive you wouldn’t know. 

00:17:40
 I think that in the face of such alarming increases in rates of HIV in certain communities around this country and really around the world, there are some bright spots. For example, in this country at least the rates of transmission to infants has really plummeted in the past few years and that’s a wonderful success story. 

00:18:05
 I think challenge of the community, the African-American community is to recognize and accept HIV and AIDS as a part of what has been going on in our society, not to shun it, to fear it, to blame, but really to deal with the problem. 

00:18:30
 To degree to which black gay men continue to be ashamed and to deny their homosexuality or to fear reprisals or non acceptance from the community, this fuels are unsafe behavior. 

00:18:45
NANCY MAHON We need to look to ourselves and look to the policies of our institutions like our school and say what are we doing and to basically give these kids the tools to practice HIV prevention. 

00:19:00
 Yes, I’d love for every young person to be abstinent. The reality is that people lead much more complicated lives. 

00:19:05
 I want smell (ph) to be all over the world and its, oh god, , it’s just, I can’t even begin to explain or express how much it means to me and how much it means to so many other people, you know. 

00:19:25
 I feel like we have a long, long, long road to travel before we can see any change. 

00:19:30
 If you’re going to go out and have sex a man on other side, you know, you have to go home and sleep with your wife, your girlfriend at least protect yourself, so you can go home and protect your woman. 

00:19:45
ANTONNE MOORE Whether using the church, whether using the NAACP, SCLC, there are ways in which you can communicate with the community about HIV and about health. 

00:19:50
 Just be aware and don’t think it’s not going to happen to you, it can happen to anybody. That’s how easy it is, AIDS is not immune to anybody. 

00:20:00
 Most people who are in prison do return to the community. The degree to which they received good medical care in prison and emerge a more of healthy person in a person who is connected to healthcare in the community that’s a benefit to all of us in society. 

00:20:15
 I think it’s important that we recognize that the government cannot do it all that it has to be in partnership and different players have different roles in this epidemic. 

00:20:25
 We have clients who are very, very challenged on a daily basis in terms of employment, funding, you know not having enough money to meet basic needs, and I only can see that getting worst. 

00:20:45
 We’re saying young people at risk and we need to be in schools and we need to be talking to children. And if the government is not going to finance those kinds of discussions or encourage those kind of discussions, then we need private sector dollars to do that. And if the private sector doesn’t make it a priority then how do we save this generation. 

00:21:00
 I see a global issue, I see the reinforced need and the rising and the increasing necessity of information and education and access. 

00:21:15
 We don’t look at on equal access to healthcare in our society. You know it’s not a gay issue, it’s not a female issue, it’s not an issue for Africans, it’s a world issue and we need to look at it from that perspective if we are going to fight this thing. 

00:21:30
 I think we have to really talk to people about being comfortable with self, being aware of self, and then we can address the issues, issues beyond just HIV and AIDS, but the issues that affect our community in the society. 

00:21:45
 Hope, like I said, hope is a really fragile thing. I’d rather not rely on hope, I’d rather rely on my commitment to do anything what I can do. 

00:21:50
 Unless and until black people to have the commitment, the infrastructure, and the capacity to respond to this epidemic, there is no way to end this epidemic in black community. 

00:22:00
 I think the attempts, even well meaning attempts to try and put a dichotomy between prevention and treatment is really an artificial one. I think you must look at them as a comprehensive strategy to contain this epidemic. 

00:22:15
 Every single day we need to have articles in every single black publication around HIV AIDS. 

00:22:25
 I need to know that as many people know it’s possible that you know how to really appreciate their life and how to value life in itself. 

00:22:30
JESSICA. R I’m hopeful there is some way, and somehow we could all see that this is going to affect us someway and that we all need to work together and not against each other. 

00:22:40
PERNESSA SEELE Let’s come together and do what black people do, let’s come together and pray for HIV, and of course, prayer in our community is an action word.

JONATHAN I wish they have a cure for it, you know, so like if you do get it, you always have a cure. That’s my wish. 

00:23:00
 I know a lot of people who have very critical and very serious illnesses and I really like to give the message out there people don’t have to let the illness define them. 

00:23:15
 People believe that what’s happening in Africa could never happen in America. But if you just look at the numbers as they’re increasing, we will absolutely see an Africa if we don’t do something and it’s going to take everyone to take a piece of this. 

00:23:30
 What I would say to everybody in the world about this subject it’s real. It is happening to each and every one of us, everyday, and there are some serious, serious consequences. And like I said all the time, you know, support your brother, love your brother, be there for your brother, do something about it.
