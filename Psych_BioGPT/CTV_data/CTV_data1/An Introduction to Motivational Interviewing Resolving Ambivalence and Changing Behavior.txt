TARA DEWITT Hello. I'm Tara Dewitt, I'm a clinical psychologist. I received my PhD in Clinical Psychology with a health emphasis at Ferkauf Graduate School of Sheba University. I work as integrated primary care and health behavioral psychologist at the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs Hospital of New York Harbor. I am also a national motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement therapy consultant, for the Veterans Affairs Care System. I also maintain a small private practice in the West Village of Manhattan.

What is Motivational Interviewing? 

00:00:40
TARA DEWITT Motivational interviewing is a collaborative goal oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is the designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person's own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. It was developed in the 1980s, by Bill Miller and Steve Rollnick. It really evolved from the feeling that there should be a better way to engage clients with substance abuse concerns. Since the 1980s, motivational interviewing has taken off and is now highly utilized, well researched and shown to be effective with any behavior change from smoking cessation to medication adherence. Bill Miller speaks of clinicians naturally being drawn to motivational interviewing. As there is an understanding that this is the way our clients change. When our clients are not wrestling with us, it frees them up to look within and to reflect upon their own behavior and how they might wanna change it. The overarching sphere of motivational interviewing holds that the client has within them. The capacity for change and is better convinced that the reasons for making this change by what they come up with, rather than what we as therapist think will work for them. Motivational interviewing has evolved overtime. The most recent edition-MI3, holds that the spirit of motivational interviewing includes partnership, acceptance, evocation, and compassion. Compassion is a rather new addition and highlights at the clinician, is clearly working in the client's best interest. It delineates MI from a good sales conversation. Another point a recent distinction in there, in order to do MI, we must have a clear target behavior and be able to ascertain that moving in a certain direction is in the client's best interest. For example, we can clearly state that stopping smoking is in the client's best interest. We don't want to utilize MI, when we're in a place of equipoise, where it is not clear what direction is in the client's best interest. For example, we aren't able to ascertain which direction is in alliance best interest. Regarding having kids, are not, or donating a kidney. MI-3 has also moved the tent poles out a bit, in the Parameters for Target behavior. The target behavior can be broader than a specific behavior change, for instance, to be more assertive or to work on being more forgiving. Motivational interviewing is a guided style of therapy that involves four bi-directional processes. Engagement, focusing, evoking and planning. It holds the client-centered Rogerian frame. The clinician is aligned alongside the client and it's gently guiding them in a connected engaged way. When the client is not having discord with us. It frees them up to reflect upon their internal discord or ambivalence with their current behavior. They can then begin to reflect and speak about their own desires and reasons in need for change. Engagement and accurate empathy providing reflections that speak to the clients experience are a key foundation. If at any point engagement is lost, the clinician should back up and realign with the client. 

00:04:00
Change Talk 

00:04:00
TARA DEWITT Motivational Interviewing attends to language a change talk. As clinicians, you want to tune or eager to change talk and become change detectives. Listening for and responding to the client's reason for change. Motivational Interviewing provides us with it an acronym here to help tune our ear. Darn Cat. The darn is preparatory language of change, desire, ability reasons and need for making a change. The cat is commitment language. Commitment, activation and taking steps. It is not essential to be able to say for in the moment, which part of the academic is being spoken to. Rather it is a tool to help us continue to tune our ear and not leave any change on the table. Change talk evokes ambivalence. Ambivalence is a key component with a motivational interviewing. Feeling ambivalent are two ways about something is a challenging place to sit. Ultimately, one decides to move in one direction or the other. Change happens through sitting with ambivalence. 

00:05:00
Confidence Rulers 

00:05:05
TARA DEWITT Confidence rulers are great tool for assessing the client's importance and confidence to make a change. Well, confidence rulers consistent close questions. They provide an opportunity for change talk. You might ask a client on the scale of one to ten, how confident are you? They can cut down on you're smoking. Say the client says six. With them wanna ask about both sides of the scale. You're pretty confident. I'm curious, why did you say a six and not a four or five? Then follow up with what would help you to move up to seven or nine. We can ask the same question, substituting importance for confidence. This is a great tool to have in your back pocket and could be particularly great to use, when you're feeling a little stuck or maybe struggling to move the client past sustained talk. Also it could help guide or intervention. If a client is low on motivation or low on confidence, it may be helpful to do some skill based work and then continue with MI. 

00:06:05
O.A.R.S 

00:06:05
TARA DEWITT The primary tools of motivational interviewing are called OARS. Open ended questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries. Open ended questions or questions that evoke more than a yes or no response. Are prefixes particularly important, when utilizing open ended questions? Questions that begin with "could you" or "do you" are close questions, and we want to work to open these questions up, shifting our prefix. Prefixes such as what or how open up are questions. For example, what is your drinking like on a particular day or how do you feel about your drinking? Open questions invite more change talk and allow an opportunity to ask more about the change talk that the client has already provided. Such as what would it look like to drink less each day? Affirmations support, that the client is the expert on their own experience and on their behavior. It elicits their autonomy and capacity to make this change. This is really important as most change happens outside of the therapy room. It is critical for the client to believe that they can hold on to their capacity to make this change outside of the treatment room. Skillful reflections are perhaps the most important component of MI. They're far more than repeating back with a client has just said. Skillful nuanced reflections provide accurate empathy and deep in the client's understanding of why they wanna make a change and affirm their autonomy in making this change. Reflections elicit change talk and also a evoke a meta cognitive process. The client starts to think about change more deeply. This may even be beyond what we hear in the change talk and maybe more important actually making and sustaining a change. Summaries offer a bouquet of reflections back to the client. They frequently reinforce, deepen, and affirm the change talk. They also provide an opportunity for the clinician to check in, making sure that they hearing all the reasons for change. Some ways are a great opportunity to dip your toe in the water planning. Following up with an open ended question, for instance, you're really talking about all the reasons why you wanna make this change, it is important to you? Improving your health, get a ling along better with your friends and family and having a more stable living environment. Where does this leave you? Where would you like to go from here? Signs that a client may be ready to begin discussing planning include increased change talk, diminished discord, beginning to envision what the change will look like and asking questions about making the change. When we hear these signs, we wanna dip our toe into the planning waters. If at anytime we are losing the engagement with the client. We want to slow down and back up a bit. Signs that we are moving too fast including increased sustain talk and discord. We then wanna dance with discord by apologizing, reflecting, affirming and emphasizing their autonomy.

Session with Client 

00:09:10
TARA DEWITT Hi, Robert, thanks for coming in today. Nice to meet you. 

00:09:10
ROBERT GRANT Nice to meet you too. 

00:09:15
TARA DEWITT So I've looked through your chart a little bit and I also really like to hear from you what brings you in today? 

00:09:20
ROBERT GRANT Well, umm… my, uh… my girlfriend, uh… She, uh… she's been, umm… I guess, I guess what I would be concerned about, uh… that I'm drinking too much and I am, and I, you know, I mean, I didn't think, you know, of course I don't think that and, umm… 'cause I pretty much been, umm… umm… you know, drinking since my Navy days and stuff like that when I went and I went to the military right after high school. But, uh… umm… mere recently I uh… an incident happened at, umm… umm… this wedding, where I umm… I guess you could say I embarrassed us both, you know, spoke, you know and so, umm… she just kind of sad, said maybe, you know. 

00:10:25
Working on engagement. Asking client about experience(Engagement) 

00:10:25
TARA DEWITT So this is kind of what you've already… always done, right? This, this amount of drinking or this isn't a change for you and something happened at the, at the wedding that felt like it was a little bit different. 

00:10:40
Complex reflection. Validating sustain talk and leaning into change(Engagement) 

00:10:40
ROBERT GRANT Yes. Yes and maybe no, I mean, I mean to, uh… to be for, full, you know, fully honest, umm… you know, I… yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe my drinking has picked up some, because of, uh… may… uh… after my mother passed. And, umm… you know, I mean it, just I mean, but I don't think, you know, I mean up until this point I don't think, you know, was an issue. I mean, umm… 'cause it's just, you know, it's just socially, you know, what we do, I mean I don't know. 

00:11:25
Complex reflection and open ended question(Engagement) 

00:11:25
TARA DEWITT You've been going through a lot of difficult things and it feels like it's not a lot of a change. For you and, and I'm also hearing you say that your, your girlfriend's worried about your drinking. What are your thoughts or kind of where things are at now? 

00:11:40
ROBERT GRANT Well, I mean, I mean she's been on me for, for a while and, uh… you know, course I'm, even thought I've just, you know, always try to brush it off, umm… but, you know, it has made me think, you know, I've been thinking of stuff like that and, umm… I mean, the thing is that, umm…. is, you don't, there's no preparation for losing a parent, right? So, and, you know, and mom is the only one we've ever had. So, my siblings and I and so, umm… I mean, umm… so I'd like to, you know, I evaluated my, you know, thinking about it and I've been drinking more ever since then, umm… but I figured I'm always going to work. I'm always going to work and stuff like that and, you know, and pretty much up into this thing at the wedding. I think there is, you know, has there been anything bad, but you know, to be at, yeah, it's easier to drink than think continuously… you know, what I mean. 

00:13:00
Complex reflection and affirmation(Engagement) 

00:13:00
TARA DEWITT Here you're, you're have experienced a huge loss, right? It feels like the loss of your mom is this, this big hole for you right now. And when you kind of stop and think about it. It feels like maybe you're drinking a little bit more instead of thinking about the loss of your mom. 

00:13:15
ROBERT GRANT Yeah, umm… yeah, definitely. I mean, umm… you know, I'm the oldest of five so, umm… and you know, and umm… I can't… well, see, I, the reason why I, you know, brush my, I brush my girlfriend off is because, I mean, you know, we, you know, we've been dealing with stuff for a long time, you know, my mother when she was alive, you know, she was, uh… you know, she had mental issues, mentally ill for a long time in and, umm… you know, and it happened before I was a preteen so, umm… you know, and then in out of foster home and stuff like that, but I don't like to, you know, use excuses, you know uh… because we went through stuff and, you know, I mean is those are the cards we were dealt but I and, and mom was, you know, she was really, really tough physically and mentally even though she was had the issues but the way she passed, you know, at the end when, you know, how she died, well, you know, she had to get to feeding tube and tracheotomy, umm… I just, I mean, I just, I just found that unfair. So, umm… 

00:14:55
Affirmation. Double sided reflection working to evoke ambivalence(Engagement) 

00:14:55
Reflecting back change talk. Asking permission to lean into this change talk(Engagement) 

00:14:55
TARA DEWITT You know, I'm, I'm hearing that that you're really tough too and part of you is holding that this is, this is not a change where in terms of the amount you're drinking and another part of you that is considering that maybe this is a change. Maybe things have picked up a little bit and I'm wondering if we kind of, it's okay if we kind of lean into that voice a little bit. What, what that voice to has say a little bit more of? 

00:15:20
ROBERT GRANT Well, I mean it's, umm… it, I mean, it's true. I mean, yeah, I mean, I, umm… I have, you started drink… I mean, I've been drinking more since she's, since she passed, but, umm… I just figured this as long as I was, uh… pretty much able to keep up the front as they would say or something like that, umm… and, you know, I mean, I didn't have never been, you know, trouble or stuff like that. So I mean, it's better than, I think it's better than, you know, at least that's what I always feels, better than sitting there, you know, crying and feeling sorry for yourself. It's not like mom's coming back or something like that. I mean, and but yeah I, you know, I can't say, I can't deny I haven't been drinking more so I certainly can't deny, you know, what happened at the wedding so. 

00:16:25
Affirmation and reflection(Focusing) 

00:16:25
TARA DEWITT You're a survivor. You get things done. You're going to work right? And it feels like now something started to shift a little bit. There was this incident at the wedding. It feels like it's a little bit harder to kind of keep things in check with the amount of drinking. 

00:16:40
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean, and, and it' s uh… you know, because I, uh… umm… my mother was, you know, having five kids in tow with mental illness and working and just she couldn't work no more. And so, I'd feel, you know, I'd feel even though you say I'm strong but, you know, from when I think about my mom I don't think I'm strong because I'm out, all I have is, you know, myself, my girlfriend, I, you know, umm… I'm not mentally ill, you know, umm… not, not into home or anything like that all have to do is just, uh… you know, go to work and that is, but if that makes it even worse because you're now feel was, I'd feel was, I feel I'm weak because even through all that my mom didn't drink and stuff like that, you know, she didn't, umm… and I never thought of drinking as a cop-out, you know or but maybe it is. 

00:17:55
Open ended question. Asking permission(Engagement/Focusing) 

00:17:55
TARA DEWITT So is that okay, if I ask a little bit about why you think you're drinking has picked up now? 

00:18:00
ROBERT GRANT Sure. I mean, umm… When mom passed I didn't like really, uh… cry 'cause I won't and, you know, like actually even well because I was mad-one. Two- And then I, you know, I just refused to, uh… you know, I didn't like, I don't know why but I've refused to, you know, cry or somewhat and umm… I mean, I think, that, uh… kind of, umm… it's come back to haunt me in a sense, because, uh… you know, you know, people say it's better to it let it out all of this other stuff, but, uh… and then, you know, I'm being, and being depressed is, you know, or having depression. I mean, you know, I know, I was had certain amount because of what we were born into so and depression for kids cope with kids or it's, is, is, you know, that's like that's a given because of what we experience but I didn't know how much, it grew and it and it started even before she passed because, you know, those last few years were not, it wasn't a good sight so… 

00:19:25

Affirmation and Reflection(Focusing/Evoking) 

00:19:30
TARA DEWITT You're working really hard to, to put forward this brave face and it sounds like and tell me what you think about this, it feels like it's starting to take a little bit of a toll on you? 

00:19:40
ROBERT GRANT Oh, it's… Yeah. It's taking, umm… is taking a lot of toll because, uh… it's like, you know, uh… what people think you're doing well, you know, people you want 'cause, umm… well and is putting up with, you know, pretty faces you as you say, so it looks like you, you know, people think that I'm, uh… you know, like "Oh, you're, and you're, you know, you look, you're doing all these things," whatever, but inside, you know, it's a whole… you know, I what I mean, inside I know how I'm really feeling and but when you, you know, when I drink, I don't have to, you know, I mean is, you don't think about that stuff as much and… 

00:20:30
Summary(Evoking) 

00:20:30
TARA DEWITT The drinking has allowed you to keep up this brave front. Right this face that everything's okay and now it sounds like something else is starting to happen. 

00:20:40
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. It's a, it doesn't umm… it doesn't work like that anymore. It's and, you know, I mean, I, umm… I can't out, I'll drink what I feel, yes, and you have to really if I was at this, put a to… a label or statement on it, but, umm… 

00:21:05
TARA DEWITT Yeah, it was working and, and now it's not. 

00:21:10
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. And, you know, and maybe it was never working, you know, it's just, ah… just delaying or, or masking, I don't know, umm… and, and, you know, what's in, what's embarrassing about it is that, you know, I don't, you know, umm… you know, making it as yourself is someone's wedding, how can you, you know, that unless someone special day, and that's not who I am, you know, as a person, umm… but drinking magnifies what happens inside us that's just what I believe, umm… 

00:21:50
Affirmation and open ended question(Evoking) 

00:21:50
TARA DEWITT Is really important for you to feel in control? To feel that you're kind of being your best selves and I'm wondering as you kind of think about this now, where does drinking fit into that for you? 

00:22:05
ROBERT GRANT Umm… It, uh… it tells a lie. It, umm… it doesn't really, umm… let me really look, uh… at the full truth it doesn't, umm… certainly doesn't let me deal with myself, you know, I mean and you're right. I'm always like to be in control and that's why, you know, this incident at the wedding is, you know, is so embarrassing, that's why I'm sitting here because, I'm always in control, even when I'm really mad or sad or whatever, I mean, I'm on because I learned that from my mom, she was very strong soul and, you know, I'm always in control and put, you know, pushing what I feel down and stuff like that, and it's, you know, 'cause… 

00:23:05
Reflection. Highlighting emotional process(Evoking) 

00:23:05
TARA DEWITT Yeah, it makes the pain a little bit easier and sometimes it seems when the drinking increases. It, it pains you, it pains other people. 

00:23:15
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean, umm… and this small stuff leading up to this big, uh… incident, you know, and, umm… and I just been, I don't, you know, I just haven't been, yeah, I just haven't been honest with myself, but, you know, uh… this is the way I've always been able or at least, you know, this is the way I've always operated, you know, even before drinking, you know, mom… first started getting sick all of this stuff we've… and then figured out that it gonna be this way, you know, then you, you start getting hardened in a way, you know. 

00:24:00
TARA DEWITT Yeah. You're working really hard to be honest with yourself. Right now. 

00:24:05
ROBERT GRANT Yeah, because, uh… I can't, I mean that, you know, that wedding like you can't, I can't act like that didn't happen. I can't act like, uh… it could have been prevented, you know, I can chalk it up like it's just life, 'cause that's not true. I mean, I was the one that was intoxicated, I was the one, you know, who was embarrassing and out of control and I didn't you know, and no one, no one forced to drink that amount, but my mouth so. 

00:24:40
Reflecting desire of client to shift to who he wants to(Evoking) 

00:24:40
TARA DEWITT Yeah. You want to do better next time, for yourself, for your girlfriend and for your friends. 

00:24:50
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean, umm… even for uh… my mother, because my mother was a lot stronger than, uh… I think I know who I am. And so, it's and that makes it even worse because I think, you know, here she dealt with all that and here I'm like you know, I'm dealing with this and, and you know, and I don't, you know, I'm kind of doing it to myself. 

00:25:20
Affirmation. Open ended question(Evoking) 

00:25:20
TARA DEWITT You want to carry forward all of her strength? 

00:25:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. 

00:25:20
TARA DEWITT And where does your drinking fit into that? 

00:25:25
ROBERT GRANT It doesn't, umm… Well, it mean, it when I… when I… when I started, when I just start thinking about things really and, and, and then feeling what I feel like, you know, which is always, you know, some sort of sadness or whatever pain or regret, then you know, I drink or it'll takes… you know, ease that away, so then I feel as though I'm, you know umm… I'm good, I'm strong, you know, I'm not you know, breaking down and I'm not, you know, being soft. 

00:26:15
TARA DEWITT It makes everything a little bit easier. 

00:26:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. At least yeah, yeah, it does in my mind, sure. Umm… yeah. 

00:26:25
TARA DEWITT Helps you to kind of carry forward that strength. 

00:26:30
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean, yeah, it, it helps me carry forward, you know, umm… the belief that I, you know, I mean, and I don't have to, it doesn't seem as hard to, to hide what I'm, you know, feeling the stuff like that. It's a, but it's, it's, uh… you know, it's a lie, so… 

00:27:00
TARA DEWITT So it feels like it kind of representing the strength and am I hearing this right. It doesn't feel like its true strength? It's a lie? 

00:27:15
Affirmation and Reflection(Evoking) 

00:27:15
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. Definitely because, uh… my mom didn't drink and look at the strength she had so, I can't always, you know, think about, that's how I put things in or put things in context, so it's, you know, in comparison to my mom and how she did things in ways and she didn't drink it and she definitely has more strength than I am displaying and umm… so it's a, it's a, you know, it makes me feel like I'm okay. It makes me feel, there, you know, I can't go out and socialize and, you know, no one's gonna to be able to figure out what I'm feeling. 

00:28:00
Reflection(Evoking) 

00:28:00
TARA DEWITT So for a moment, you get to kind of then embody, this person that they want to fully be, right? And then as the drinks increase so or it's a kind of wears off. It feels like it if that starts to disappear, right? 

00:28:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. It, I mean, when if it's a good day, of course, I'm like , you know, very social and very, you know, I'll going in and, you know, so yeah, I feel great, right and then, you know, as you coming back down, yeah, you know, of course, reality discomforts right back and then it seems to come back, even harder, you know, and, and then, you know, I feel like I'm a loser in a sense. So, it's like, uh… I don't know it's just a repeating episode of something. 

00:29:00
Open ended question 

00:29:00
TARA DEWITT When are those moments that you feel like you have that true strength and you haven't been drinking? 

00:29:10
ROBERT GRANT And I haven't been drinking? When… 

00:29:10
TARA DEWITT Is that something that feels possible? 

00:29:15
ROBERT GRANT No. That, yeah, there it, yeah, it is possible. I mean, it's, uh… it's, umm… when it may sound weird but it's when I don't run from, you know, what I feel or what I'm thinking about it. It's, uh… it's when I'd, umm… you know, maybe instead of, you know, grabbing a drink, you know, and you go to the gym or some… you know, it's, umm… because of why I feel even stronger because I don't have that mom coming, you know, coming back down and then, umm… but when you, you know, when you got, I gotta deal with, you know, tons of people and stuff like that, just, you know. 

00:30:10
Reflection(Evoking) 

00:30:10
TARA DEWITT So there's these moments where it's a little bit easier to kind of feel like you can really harness your strength, to kind of carry your mom's legacy forward? 

00:30:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. We had there and it's, yeah, there's like fleeting moments when that happens and, umm… but I can't, uh… you know, like keep it going. It's just, you know, it's every once in a while, but it, it's… you know, but then I mean, I'm always coming back thinking, uh… you know, about mom and, you know, how when we were young, everything, before she got sick and, you know, stuff like that and then. 

00:31:00
Reflection of the Desires and Reasons of DARN(Evoking) 

00:31:00
TARA DEWITT You have all these reasons to carry your mom's legacy forward, right? And I'm wondering where your drinking fits into that? 

00:31:15
ROBERT GRANT Well, umm… I think it, it, it, umm… honestly, it's, it, it stops me from, uh… being able to do that any, uh… more honest way, it's… it's… it stops me umm… from seeing mom's, you know, the positive side of mom's story, you know, so… to drinking and even though I think I'm feeling stronger and stuff like that, you know, it, it actually kind of feels, the misery in a sense, but you know, by that, you know, I'm feeling like "Oh, I'm strong," because I can this misery too and tell I'm good, you know, but you know, but, I'm not doing, you know, my mom's legacy much, you know, embarrass my mom would be if she knew about that thing, you know, at the, at the wedding, that's not how did she, she would say that's not how you were raised. 

00:32:25
TARA DEWITT It's not sustainable? 

00:32:30
Reflection. Working to evoke ambivalence(Evoking) 

00:32:30
ROBERT GRANT Not at all. Never, it's never and, you know, I mean that's why you know, you drink more, and more, and more. 

00:32:40
TARA DEWITT So it provides the strength in that moment. And yet not in the long term? 

00:32:45
ROBERT GRANT Never. It's never been in the long term, I mean, if, if that was the case and, you know, what I had done, you know, I had this big embarrassing moment, would I, umm… be making my girlfriend cry because of she thinks I don't care about myself, I don't see, you know, the harm I'm doing to myself, you know, I can't call the truth lies, I mean. 

00:33:20
Reflection. Highlighting desire for change(Evoking) 

00:33:20
TARA DEWITT Your girlfriend's worried about your drinking and I'm hearing that you're starting to feel a little bit more worried about it too? 

00:33:25
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I am, I mean, I, umm…. because, you know, I mean, I'm gonna always have to, you know, remember that the wedding is so, I'm gonna, you know, and I know for sure I wouldn't have embarrass myself if I had didn't have too many drinks, I know that. So I know, at least I can't control that, I can't control what I'm, you know, I'm gonna act now, when I'm drinking too much. I can't, I can't deny that, so yeah, and if I wasn't worried about it, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I definitely wouldn't be here. 

00:34:15
Reflection. Highlighting importance of behavior change(Evoking) 

00:34:15
TARA DEWITT This is something that is starting to feel more and more important to you to change and to shift. 

00:34:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah, extremely, a bit other, you know, umm… I love my girlfriend, I mean, you know, when I love my mom, and umm… I don't want to embarrass them or myself. I don't wanna, want someone to think about, you know, "Oh, Robert and then, you know, we don't wanna deal with him," you know, I mean that I used to think I didn't care but I do, it's just, umm… 

00:34:55
Reflection(Evoking) 

00:34:55
TARA DEWITT You really wanna be there for yourself and for those that you love. 

00:35:00
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. 

00:35:00
TARA DEWITT So, so how can I help when you think about that you're drinking and coming in here today? 

00:35:05
ROBERT GRANT How do you go. Umm… Well, I guess, uh… you could umm… keep me, umm… I'm finding a way to, uh… to really be honest and taking stock all the time. And I am umm… not necessarily, uh… but yeah, just some, yeah, just 'cause I worry about being judged and if I'm not, if I don't think I'm being judged and, you know, then I can't be honest and, you know. 

00:36:00
Reflection. Working to continue to tune in(Planning) 

00:36:00
TARA DEWITT Sort of kind of continue these conversations, right in a way that you can kind of continue figure out for yourself, how you want to make this change? How you may wanna shift your drinking? Am I getting that right? 

00:36:15
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean, how I would like to even, not even drink or you know, or have to have a drink, umm… and that depend on, uh… alcohol to be feeling strong and, umm… sociable and that's when I would really like… 

00:36:40
Reflection and Affirmation(Planning and Evoking) 

00:36:40
TARA DEWITT To really think other ways that, you can kind of harness your true strength without using alcohol. 

00:36:50
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. Umm… yeah, finding a way to just, umm… you know, as my mother did, I don't know it's just, umm… there was no additives with her, she just, you know, and her only additive was her, you know, with her, her illness but she didn't pile it to one, you know. I don't know how she did it but, you know, she did it, and I would, you know, and, you know, that's what I would like to do. You know, but I miss her at the same time, was just saying, so…. 

00:37:25
TARA DEWITT So kind of how to best carry forward her legacy? 

00:37:30
Reflection 

00:37:30
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. 

00:37:35
Providing options and affirming autonomy(Planning) 

00:37:35
TARA DEWITT And so, I was thinking if it's okay to kind of offer you, uh… kind of a menu of choices here, kind of couple different options in terms of thinking about things going forward, right? So what are the things that I was thinking about is, for maybe us to continue to work together, you know, maybe over eight, twelve weeks and kind of see how things, things go and continue to have conversations about your drinking. And the other thing, we can do that and we have some groups as well. Other people who are kind of experiencing similar things that you're experiencing and sometimes, that's a nice option to, to hear other people's stories too, if that's something you'd be open to, it's really up to you. 

00:38:20
ROBERT GRANT Well, umm… I would rather just, you know, uh… just be one on one, you know, I mean, you know, because I am never, you know, a minute much to anyone else. So, I don't know if I would be, I don't know, you know, how good I would be there. 

00:38:50
Affirming Autonomy and Reflecting(Engagement) 

00:38:50
TARA DEWITT Yeah. It's your decision. 

00:38:50
ROBERT GRANT Right. 

00:38:50
TARA DEWITT Right. And really feeling that this is, this is a brave new step and so wanting to kind of maybe just me individually for a little while. 

00:39:05
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. Does it mean that, umm… because I have to come here like I am weak? Does that mean that… that, you know, if you have to see someone that makes you, uh… weak or soft, what is, it does that? 

00:39:20
Summary and Affirming Autonomy(Engagement) 

00:39:20
TARA DEWITT Yeah. You, you were you really talked about all your different strengths today. 

00:39:25
ROBERT GRANT Right. 

00:39:25
TARA DEWITT Right, and your real desire and capacity to wanna make things better for yourself, for your girlfriend, for other people and for your mom. 

00:39:30
ROBERT GRANT Right. 

00:39:35
TARA DEWITT So, you tell me what you think, but that sounds like strength to me. 

00:39:40
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. I mean it, it takes a lot of strength, umm… but I just always, you know, I guess I always thought it was, you know, you, when you say you need help like this, it's, you're not strong. 

00:40:00
Summary(Engagement) 

00:40:00
TARA DEWITT You're really working to think about, making a lot of changes in your lives. Are you talking about earlier about how it's, it's easier to drink than the think? And I hear what you're starting to do is to shift that. 

00:40:20
ROBERT GRANT Yeah. Yes. And I don't want to, umm… I don't want to, you know, incidence like that, but I, I don't want also, also don't, uh… umm… I don't wanna have to, to, to work so hard to put up a, you know, like a pretty face or whatever they call it, umm… because uh… you know, I don't, I mean, yeah, I know how I feel, but I don't think I have it, you know, if my mother can do it what she did, until she could even more or I could hopefully find a way to least try, so that's how I'm thinking about this. 

00:41:05
Summary(Keeping engagement and planning) 

00:41:05
TARA DEWITT You wanna find a better way, right? A better way to kind of be strong and to brave… to be brave and to not be drinking as much and that's certainly something we can continue to working on together. 

00:41:15
ROBERT GRANT Yeah, and that's what I would like. 

00:41:20
TARA DEWITT Yeah. So, its okay, and we will kind of step aside. Look at our calendars and see what we can set up next. 

00:41:25
ROBERT GRANT Okay. Yeah. 

00:41:25
TARA DEWITT Thanks for coming in today, Robert. 

00:41:30
ROBERT GRANT Thank you, appreciate it. 

00:41:35
Debriefing with Therapist and Client 

00:41:35
KEVIN NADAL Hi. My name is Dr. Kevin L. Nadal and I'm an associate professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Uh… today, we're gonna debriefing the session that we just watched and so, first I wanna thank our participants Dr. Dewitt and Grant. For sharing, uh… your story today. Uh… Dr. Dewitt can you tell us a little bit more about some of the techniques that you used today? 

00:41:55
TARA DEWITT Certainly, So Grant was speaking a lot about his concern or his girlfriend's concerned about his drinking and so really we're kind of working to stay on the target behavior of drinking and to reflect back to him, what are some of his reasons for making this change, kind of what's working for him or what's has been working for him in the past and what's no longer working for him? 

00:42:15
KEVIN NADAL Can you tell me some of action, the techniques that you were using and I noticed you had a lot of just acknowledging that is, what he was saying to you, you were, uh… validating, repeating a lot of his, umm… emotions and also doing a lot of strength based, uh… kind of techniques, so can you tell me little bit about that? 

00:42:35
TARA DEWITT Yeah. He really kind of like, like leaning into the sustain talk a little bit, to affirming and kind of validate the experience and then kind of bring forward some more the change talk, the DARN-C, write the reasons for making this change and also do a lot of the O.A.R.S, right it sort of open ended questions or affirmations, their reflections and our summaries, to kind of evoke for him, the reasons why he wanna make this change. 

00:43:00
KEVIN NADAL Okay. So Grant can you tell us about what it was like, just being in the session, and, and listening to a Dr. Dewitt and hearing some of the techniques that she was used? 

00:43:05
ROBERT GRANT Oh, yeah. Umm… it was, umm… of course, you know, I had this really big embarrassing moment, so and it's my first time here with her. So she was very good at, umm… letting me, you know, slowly come out with what I was saying, uh… but what was really, uh…. really good was that everything, she would take whatever I, I gave her or wherever I left off and, uh… if she needed to, to be further explained, you know, she would prod be a little bit, but she would always bring it back to the reason why, uh… I was here which was the, you know, because I feel that still my drinking is gotten out of hand and she would always, uh… put back into how does my drinking affect this situation. How does it hurt or help the situation and, umm… which can't, umm… it helped me, not able to like, uh… not that I would, but we use to wide anything… 

00:44:10
KEVIN NADAL Sure. Right. Kept you focused, it kept you knowing what you, why you're and also that what's it meant for. 

00:44:15
ROBERT GRANT And also, it kept me, uh… really, uh… umm… being honest with myself so, umm… it was helping paint the picture that was already there, by putting even more, umm… details into it I would say that's how I'd explain it. 

00:44:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I like that she stayed with you and I liked all the different techniques that the reflections, the encouragement, the validation, umm… and it just seemed like every time she said something that it kept you focused and then encouraged you to, to open up a little bit more, yeah. 

00:44:45
ROBERT GRANT Right, and she would, umm… what was good for my character is, umm… because I talked about how much of my mother's, uh… story, uh… her strengths in all this others, other, these other things she would, umm… circle back with those as well, and umm… and she, she was able to bring out that I, you know, really wanted to, umm… you know, make my mother proud and so you didn't say proud but, you know, my mother's, you know, legacy in way and, umm… and that made me comfortable enough to, uh… wanted to keep talking, but also wanted to, umm… come back. 

00:45:30
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, it seemed like you a good rapport and take your empathy really showed through which again encouraged him to, to speak even more. Uh… one thing that I think it's really important is, you know, for people to know, umm… when like a someone's watching this video will, will know what was your process, what were you going through as, as you're doing these techniques. Just to help folks understand, what, what goes on in the therapist head. 

00:45:50
TARA DEWITT Yeah. So certainly kind of holding the spirit motivational interviewing, so kind of working to come alongside Robert, to really get affirm and validate this experience, take knowledge all this loss that he'd been through in terms of losing his mother and wanting to carry forward her legacy and also not to affirm that and also not follow that road too much, right? Kind of difference between like good support of psychotherapy and motivational interviewing, right, so kind of using that and evoking and eliciting from that the reasons for making this change and how this is now connected to your drinking behavior, in that becoming more of a concern for you. 

00:46:30
KEVIN NADAL Is there anything that you would have done differently in the session? 

00:46:35
TARA DEWITT So there were a couple times where I felt like I asked Robert some ended closed questions. That maybe I could've, I could come, go back in time could open up a little bit more to kind of evoke some more that change talk and let the meta cognitive process for making this change. 

00:46:50
KEVIN NADAL Okay. What, what then next session look like with motivational interviewing with Robert? 

00:46:55
TARA DEWITT So, umm… So probably some more of the same and also maybe kind of like tiptoeing into the planning waters a little bit. So doing some more and visioning kind of asking some open ended questions, coupled with some reflections about you know, where do you see yourself or where would you like to see yourself in six months in relation to your drinking. 

00:47:15
KEVIN NADAL Right. Yeah, appreciate it a lot of the, the goal setting that was both direct and indirect. So the direct being that giving him the menu of options which I think he enjoyed, umm… and then just some of the indirect pieces of like saying will meet for X. amount of sessions and these are choices that we can make and I think that, you know, helps him to stay focused right. What was it like to, to have that option, the menu of options? 

00:47:35
ROBERT GRANT What… it was, uh… it was very good because I didn't feel like, I, it was like you have to do this or we're nothing and also, umm… just and also just the way she… you said it, you know, the way you're like, you know, I'm gonna offer, offer you these, uh… menu of options and, and then you explained a little bit about, uh… you know, where, you know, the, the weeks and then with, uh… with the group thing, you know, you explain that, so it, it felt like, uh… well, I was still making the choice and I had choices which is good. 

00:48:15
KEVIN NADAL Yeah, it can be really empowering for a client. They have, uh… the control and that they are the expert in their own lives. 

00:48:20
ROBERT GRANT Right, and that's what you kept doing even within the session, you know, I'm like, umm… very good at, uh… the positive reinforcement with a, uh… you, uh… you know, you say, you very strongly, it sounds like you wanna make these changes and, you know, and, umm… yeah and I forgot to mention, but that's what's, that's was really good as a, you know, as a, uh… as a client, but, you know, feeling like you know, you're still in control, you know, and that kind of especially, uh… my first session not backed into a corner, yeah. 

00:49:00
KEVIN NADAL Yeah. So thank you so much. I think it was an excellent demonstration of motivational interviewing and I hope that people will learn from it. 

00:49:05
ROBERT GRANT They will come. 

00:49:05
TARA DEWITT Yeah. Thank you. 

00:49:05
KEVIN NADAL You're welcome.
