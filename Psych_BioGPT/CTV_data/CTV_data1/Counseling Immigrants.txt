DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hi, I am Dr. Adam Zagelbaum of Sonoma State University and welcome to this video about counseling immigrants. Essentially we’re making this video because it's important to recognize that immigration is a topic initially that affects all of us as Americans. Essentially when we are talking about immigration some terminology really comes to mind. The term immigration for example refers to basically entering into a new environment that is different from ones environment or country of origin and in terms of what process and procedures and protocols are normally followed to do the process through legal channels that refers to lawful immigration or people that are coming into the country to become Legal Permanent Residents or LPRs. And essentially LPRs in slang term or in jargon is sometimes referred to as green card recipients. And as a result there are some statistics that exist for this purpose, all of which are available in a book that I’ve edited with Jon Carlson, called Working With Immigrant Families: A Practical Guide for Counselors. And this video also will showcase some of the ideas, strategies and tactics that are incorporated in that. 

00:01:35
In 2007 Office of Immigration Statistics reported 1,052,415 people became United States Legal Permanent Residents Zagelbaum, A. & Carlson, J. (Eds.) (2010). Working with Immigrant Families: A Practical Guide for Counselors. New York: Routledge. 

00:01:35
ADAM ZAGELBAUM But according to the Office of Immigration Statistics in 2007, there were 1,052,415 Legal Permanent Residents or LPRs in the United States. 

00:01:50
Leading birth regions of people who became LPRs in 2007: China (36%) Mexico (32%) Zagelbaum, A. & Carlson, J. (Eds.) (2010). Working with Immigrant Families: A Practical Guide for Counselors. New York: Routledge. 

00:01:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM The majority of these individuals were born in China and Mexico and there are several other countries represented in the statistics that I sighted the Philippines, India, Columbia, Haiti, Cuba, Vietnam, Korea, just to name a few. But the point about all of this is being a counseling professional and one who works and lives in America, statistically you are highly likely to encounter an immigrant and their families and to be working in a way that requires you professionally to provide the services, the encouragement, the support and the necessary resources that are delivered in a way were cultural sensitivity, respect, care, genuineness and openness, guide your work. And essentially that is what we’re trying to depict on the video, in the role-plays that you’ll see. We will be presenting a school-based counseling scenario and we’ll be presenting a community-based counseling scenario. So that people in training can look at these examples, stop the tapes, discuss things and do what is necessary to academically and interpersonally explore the necessary steps and the proactive things that can be done to serve immigrants and their families and populations that you may encounter as a professional counselor. And in so doing you’ll also see some debriefings after the sessions have concluded. And in order to see how supervisory roles can assist with this service. And also you’ll have the opportunity of seeing a roundtable discussion with students that I’ve actually trained to work with clients in various populations. But students who themselves are immigrants and have dealt with immigration experiences and their culturation experiences that also helped to providing unique and important perspective to the training element of this video. So with that we encourage you to, you know sit back and enjoy what we have to present, because I think it’s a very valuable and important resource for counselors and training to have. 

00:04:10
School Counseling Vignette: Cambodian Student being teased Note how the counselor displays each of these six concepts in this vignette… • Genuineness/openness: The counselor shows honest appreciation of client concerns and uses verbal and non-verbal language to communicate this concept • Self-disclosure: The counselor relays information about an experience that shows that the counselor has been able to work with clients in similar situations. • Emphasis of collectivism and Family Inclusion: The counselor specifically calls attention to family connections and systemic resources and how they can be viewed as a strength in resolving problems. • Recognition of Gender and Power Roles: The counselor specifically acknowledge the hierarchy and status identity within the client’s family. • Action planning and Giving of Resources. The counselor suggests actions to consider to actively address the problem. The counselor also provides materials and liaison information in order to help the immigrant client proactively start the process. Please Note: This is not advice-giving. It is a problem-solving process that unfolds by a mixture of encourages and acknowledgement of client's individual, family and community strengths. • Reassurance and Follow-up Invitation. The counselor reassures the client that if the client’s actions do not immediately work, the client can check back in to continue to problem-solve. The counselor remains genuinely and openly concerned about his/her progress.

00:16:15
MIGUEL LISAH Okay! So what I... While we've discussed, right Alexis was that I would bring the students in and I, I'm not gonna tell them that Alexis told me. Okay, is that clear? 

00:16:25
WANNAH SAM Hmm... Tell me more. 

00:16:30
MIGUEL LISAH Okay, so I’m gonna bring two students in... 

00:16:30
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:16:30
MIGUEL LISAH ...without, without me telling 'em that Alexis told on them, okay? 

00:16:40

00:16:45
MIGUEL LISAH I don’t know about fix problems... 

00:16:45
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:16:45
MIGUEL LISAH ...maybe make them, the students aware... 

00:16:45
WANNAH SAM Hmm... 

00:16:50
MIGUEL LISAH ...that it's not okay for them to tease Alexis. 

00:16:50
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm...

MIGUEL LISAH Okay, 'coz we’re all different... 

00:16:55
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm...

00:17:00
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:17:05

00:18:15
Remember, when working with an immigrant client and his/her family: 1 Take a one-down approach 2 Be open/genuine 3 Do not make assumptions about what, what clients know and do not know 4 Have resources and information to provide 5 Know the client’s community of origin and present community 6 Do not be afraid to ask the client questions about his/ background 7 Clients want to trust and have the desire to tell their story! Debriefing of Role Play 

00:18:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, based on the role-play that, that we saw I think it's pretty good that, you know don't want in Miguel, and I can debrief and you know kind of process what we saw and how it went. So in general in terms of how that role-play was for everybody. Let's start with I guess Miguel as school counselor, how did that feel and, and what do you think were the highlights of the session? 

00:19:10
MIGUEL LISAH The highlights I think were that we had a student that was being teased. She was able to come in and sort of share with us. I think it's hard when someone is being teased, especially due to their race. In her case it was her, her color. So I think that was... 

00:19:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, and it was interesting too I think how you usually went a little bit of self-disclosure I saw in the session to do talk about what it was like for you to be of the different skin tone and to be experiencing that kind of stuff and that even that the point where, you wanna playing Sam joined into say, I understand and I know what that’s like. So I'm wondering to the role that you played, I wanna ask Sam, what were the highlights that you saw? What were some of the things that worked as a result of that happening? 

00:20:05
WANNAH SAM What... What I think it’s a point, because I feel like, I was actually not in that role but the student but you know no counseling was offered. I think how Miguel coming and be in a fighting environment and disclosing I think is a good stylistic counseling move, because I feel like I can't speak for all culture but for mine I feel like if you can relate yourselves, you know to me in some way... 

00:20:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:20:30
WANNAH SAM ...that kind of opens the doors and I felt like there was a highlight that helped to make the counseling possible, because trust is something that’s hard to come by. 

00:20:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... Yeah I came right out of you too and noticed she been here all, because you know the one of the clear things that I think we got to at the end of the role-play was the fact that you were going to take an approach of addressing the students and how you hesitated at first I think because it seemed like it could have created some complications... 

00:21:00
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:21:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...but ultimately that self-disclosure and the other things that I think Miguel depicted said you know, I can trust you I mean it may feel uncomfortable but I trust you and I value what you are trying to do. So in terms of I guess the strategy and the plan... 

00:21:15
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:21:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...how would that work, what would that be like if, if students were to be approached and the family was involved, you know and talking with school counselor? What... What do you think that would be like? 

00:21:30
WANNAH SAM Well I think, it was a good strategy overall. I like (inaudible ) just going off my own past experience, retaliation is something that I fear, especially if it's past the school into the community. I think what helped him was when we reassured me that he would get back to me. So I think that was a definitely a good thing to do, because you know I just think here is a thing and shut the door, it's gonna work, you are saying well we’ll see if it works and I’ll get back to you and if it doesn’t come back to the drawing board. So I mean, that’s very effective... 

00:22:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:22:05
WANNAH SAM ...it's like, you the follow through of things. 

00:22:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Any thing else as a school counselor trained to be and with credential would that strategy be the average strategy? 

00:22:15
MIGUEL LISAH Umm... I think it vary, it might vary a little bit, but it for the most part I think it is, like when I was saying if you create this inviting atmosphere with the student and disclosure, I think helps a little bit too, just because the student is no longer by themselves you know in whatever their dealing with, but kind of has a you know the counselor is like, is seen as this person that has experienced similar incidents due to race, language, culture. And so that I think helps a lot, and then also with the family, I think. Reassuring the family, you know what, we are here to work with you, we are here to watch out for you, your son or daughter's safety as well as the family doing and keeping that open communication I think with the family because ultimately they are the experts of you know like the in the role-play that he did, he was saying that his family has a... had experienced that first since they came from Cambodia, so asking them you know making them the experts and then just using that to the sort of you know go from there and… 

00:23:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Seems like you have something to say? 

00:23:30
WANNAH SAM Yeah, I was going to say that you noticed, you know lot of cultures but some Asian cultures collective everything... 

00:23:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:23:35
WANNAH SAM ...and it's the we and that’s why I kept on saying well is there gonna be retaliation gets the family not just her... 

00:23:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:23:40
WANNAH SAM ...so it's actually a whole thing and it's that why it's a good thing that you... 

00:23:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:23:45
WANNAH SAM ...that you made the environment and you know spoke on the level that it's not just gonna help your Alexis but the family… 

00:23:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, seems like the work that, that you were doing in the counseling role would probably have to extend just to the school in someway, but also in the community and family... 

00:24:00
MIGUEL LISAH Hmm...Hmm... 

00:24:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...and our territory and that seemed to be appreciated at least in the role-play and seemed to I think let's put Alexis already to do say okay I'll talk to the students and because of the family factor that I’m bringing into the room or that word during to speak to that we’re also going to care about how it's going to translate outside the school... 

00:24:20
MIGUEL LISAH Hmm...Hmm... 

00:24:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...it seems like it helped in that instance. Umm... In general, is it common or typical to have a brother come in and be involved in the process? 

00:24:35
WANNAH SAM You know, I also speak for my family. I think it is common because in some families that it goes power distributed by gender, just because there is a mum, it doesn't mean she is second or whoever female, doesn't mean she is second in line to you know I guess control the family and usually, especially in my family, my older brother was the guardian and came in school functions and doctor's appointment and stuff, because not because he wanted to 'coz that was his duty, so it is something that’s common. 

00:25:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, and it seemed like it was appreciated. And as a counselor addressing her parent or guardian in that way, what was that like? 

00:25:15
MIGUEL LISAH I mean just from, because I have experienced and I’ve been through the same you know, actually having mostly done everything for my mum and dad who didn’t speak English, I think it was nice to sort of give back a little bit and sort of understand what the family not only the student but with the brother or the mum and dad were going through and then, and then being able to provide some support for them. 

00:25:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And it's not everyday that we can sometimes get parents into the, the room, and that was really encouraging to see that... 

00:25:45
MIGUEL LISAH Exactly, yeah. 

00:25:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...this is a way that it's often encouraged at least in a Cambodian family and that was important I think for people that kind of see in that role-play that you know getting the family involved can be very-very likely. 

00:26:00
MIGUEL LISAH And I think, as we all know that it's, it's hard, it's difficult to bring in the family. So when they do make that effort to come into school, I think we should do everything in our part as school counselors to kind of grab 'em and reassure them that; Hey, we are here for you, we’re here to support you. Because we don’t want to lose them, because then in certain cultures you know sometimes someone could come across as you know, we’re not really here for you... 

00:26:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:26:25
MIGUEL LISAH ...and I think that. 

00:26:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, and it seems like there’s a bit of disconnect with that, but the sincerity and the genuineness and the trust seem to largely help that along in the scenario. And one other thing I guess we should touch on is also the, the language issue. No, I know one of your role-playing somebody with limited speaking of English in general from what you've seen and what you’ve experienced what you know, how, how is that approached in the session having with Alexis translate and getting involved with the understanding of the pacing in the conversation? 

00:27:05
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... Well I think it was fine to Alexis who was translating for me. I think any time in a situation where the other person, you know there are some kind of barrier that obvious barrier and the communications that’s I guess go as planned could approach of sensitively and not doing in the way that kind of diminishes the relationship, sort of you know like, louder speaking or anything like that or pronunciations... 

00:27:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:27:30
WANNAH SAM ...umm... So things always got to be cautious and just be patient like you said, I think patience is very key when you speaking with some one... 

00:27:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:27:35
WANNAH SAM ...whose not maybe up to speak this the other language, so... 

00:27:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And how was it like being the counselor and having to have that as an added variable? 

00:27:50
MIGUEL LISAH Umm... It can be difficult just because as a school counselor you always wanna make sure that the parent umm... you know in his case he was having a difficult time understanding some of the words or the concepts so for a counselor I think it's important like, he was saying to be patient, but also like you really wanna make sure that the mum or dad or you know the brother understand you know what, what it is that is going on. Because some might look different and different cultures teasing might be different or there might be a different name that is use for teasing. So you wanna as a counselor maybe kind of break it down or not break it down, but try to define what teasing is, in the way that, you know if the student understands it and they also the parent is going to understand what, what’s going on basically. 

00:28:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Certainly, and especially seemed to be clearing out collectivist family sort of is that everybody be on the same page... 

00:28:45
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:28:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...and though I know, some people may feel intimidated about whether not a translator or an external agent should be involved in the process, here it seemed actually quite helpful, quite strength based and if anything helped people connect. So I think something that the audience might be able to pull from that too is you know if you don’t have a translator on site or what not, often times having the student, the client, whoever serving that role can help the session, often times does and it's not something that people need to be concerned about in terms of you know, is something going to get misconstrued or, or taken out of context, because everybody is trying to be genuinely helpful and connect and I think that’s being important part again that comes to the trust. 

00:29:30
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... And it's comfortless too because I as a brother would feel comfortable if my sister communicated what... 

00:29:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah. 

00:29:40
WANNAH SAM ...you know what I was saying.. 

00:29:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:29:40
WANNAH SAM ...because like you said it could be misconstrued in all those things... 

00:29:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:29:45
WANNAH SAM ...and you know and I trust, I trust my sister... 

00:29:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:29:50
WANNAH SAM ...you can get it correctly what’s going on. 

00:29:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And in terms of other things too in terms of providing as many resources as possible we know other ways that these strategies can be employed, it's not necessarily just to keep at the level of speaking to specific students that were named in the session, but you know there could be other resources I know even Alexis has shared, you know through disclosure after we debriefed with her about cultural clubs, being at school and various other organizations and agencies that may get in there to do some sort of sensitivity training or some sort of way of addressing entire student bodies and are to may get a kind of communal mission or communal endeavor around the, the school campus. How do you guys feel about that in terms of having… 

00:30:35
MIGUEL LISAH I think as a school counselor, that’s kind of goal to make it normal, normalize you know being different, having a different culture and having a different language, having a different custom. And I think it's, if you give the students the power to, to sort of organize that, of course with, you know either supervision from, from me, from a teacher, usually teachers are most of the time in most cases willing to, to sacrifice you know an afternoon here or there to, to sort of you know start up a group you know maybe different clubs that invite students to experience you know how it is to be you know from, from a different country and being different basically so yeah. 

00:31:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, absolutely. And that was one thing also I noticed that came out of the role-plays well and made a connection with the math teacher... 

00:31:25
MIGUEL LISAH Hmm..hmm.. 

00:31:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...put that in there to show that there are strengths and connections in the school for Alexis, that that are there and having your door always open as counselor of the taps and to the strength even to more having a good connection to Sam so to speak as brother. So the way I think it worked out, I think in terms of how to demonstrate all those different variables and factors that was well done and to be able to put that role out there and support it in a way where, I think you give wish to the family side that was well done as well. 

00:32:00
MIGUEL LISAH Hmm...Hmm... 

00:32:00
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:32:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Any closing thoughts or parting ideas about the way it went? 

00:32:05
WANNAH SAM Yeah, I was going to say to about the exposure to diversity, I mean as we know the country is becoming more diverse... 

00:32:10
WANNAH SAM Yeah. 

00:32:10
WANNAH SAM ...and there is no longer going to be a majority. And now lot of places people live and get their much exposure to certain diverse types of people... 

00:32:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:32:20
WANNAH SAM ...is always good for not just carrier but also academic and personal and social to have their exposure in... 

00:32:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:32:25
WANNAH SAM ...and conducting likes cultural events, because odds are when these kids get older they gonna go to into the working world and they are gonna talk with somebody that’s maybe you know... 

00:32:35
MIGUEL LISAH Different. 

00:32:35
WANNAH SAM ...different and work with other families that are different from them and it's good to have that familiarity so to speak and to feel comfortable and to know, understand what boundary is. 

00:32:45
MIGUEL LISAH Definitely I agree with that, yeah. 

00:32:45
WANNAH SAM I feel like that’s a good way to do it and that’s what in the school counselors job, I think it’s to promote that, and embrace that diversity on campus. 

00:32:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well said. And other ideas or closing comments? Because I think in general, I think we illustrated some very important things in the role-play and I think you're right, it's not just about school safety, but it's life skills and other things that translate what are you going to be a productive citizen that feel supported and integrated into the community... 

00:33:15
MIGUEL LISAH Hmm...Hmm... 

00:33:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...especially if you've come from an external country are dealing with the cultural, racial, and immigration and seems like when you're included and find that support to translates in so many powerful ways. 

00:33:30
MIGUEL LISAH Yeah. 

00:33:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well done and thanks for doing it. 

00:33:30
MIGUEL LISAH Thank you. 

00:33:30
WANNAH SAM Thanks. 

00:33:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

00:33:35
Roundtable discussion with three immigrant professionals 

00:33:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hello, welcome to this segment of the DVD, where we will be talking to our role-players and I'm happy to be working with all of them. These are all the students who I've trained at Sanoma State University for Pupil and Personnel Services Credentials, and they have counseling experience as well as immigration experience. And our panel consists of Wannah Sam, Miguel Lisah and Maria Avenia. And so I guess in order to start maybe make the audience understand a little bit about who you are and where your at in terms of professional and personal identity. I guess why don’t we start with Miguel and may tell the audience a little bit about your cultural and immigration background and maybe some of your professional goals. 

00:34:30
MIGUEL LISAH Well I was born in Mekiko in the state called (inaudible ), and my parents immigrated to the United States, Central Valley to be exact when I was about four years old. And there was a struggle to learn a new language, to be part of a new culture, new customs. It was hard on my parents as well. So I went to school in the Centre Valley, and kind of struggled with the language. I had wonderful teachers actually a few teachers that I, I could remember by name, that kind of really more back down when I was in the elementary there was bilingual education so that teachers at, they conducted a bilingual classroom, which I think really helped me develop my English skills. With that said I didn’t start writing and speaking fluently in English until I was about, I would say maybe my first main year and comfortably I would say that I didn’t feel comfortable with the language or the culture and tell about, when I was in college. So it took a long time, before I was comfortable speaking English, comfortable with the culture, you name what I mean it did took a while for me to, to be part of the US, you know not that I have lost my culture, but it's, if you're gonna live in a new country you have to adapt to, to some other customs the culture brings with it. I went to UC Santa Barbara, got my B.A in Sociology there and that’s where I discovered that I wanted to be, I guess in the sense working with students. At that point I remembered my high school counselor. That kind of gave me the confidence and kind of sat me down and talked to me about you know going to college and in when I was at UC Santa Barbara that's when I kind of did a lot of reflection and I really pushed to be a school counselor and as you know got accepted into the Masters program at Sonoma State. My goal with that is to become a school counselor and I’m also interested in marriage and family therapy as well. I’m working within the community and the families, that's always been a goal of mine to give back to, to the community, help the teachers, help the parents. 

00:37:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, it's been a period of growth, adjustment and I think things that are trying to connect in and out a both, you know the school and community work that, I think you're trying to pass along to future generations... 

00:37:15
MIGUEL LISAH Exactly, yeah. 

00:37:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent! Maria would you like to tell your story? 

00:37:20
MARIA AVENIA Yeah. So, I immigrated to the United States, my mum immigrated, brought us all over and when I was ten years old, so we immigrated to North California. My father used to work in the fields and so we were reunited with him. So we did not have the opportunity to go to school for the first two years in the United States. And in Méjico the educational background, we didn’t have any school. I didn’t go to school in Méjico, so my first two-year of education and educational system was in fifth grade, the end of the fifth grade. So just looking at how hard my parents worked in the fields and the opportunities I would have if I continue with my education, I decided to set some goals and be determined and follow those goals. So I did struggle with the language. I was stayed during sixth grade during lunch and recess and read and tried to learn English with the best way could... 

00:38:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:38:30
MARIA AVENIA ...it was a definitely I struggled middle school... 

00:38:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:38:30
MARIA AVENIA ...and it wasn't until high school that I felt confident enough to understand the culture, the culture in the United States little bit better as well as the language, the customs, the traditions. And I started, started embracing them as well, but still continuing to have my own culture... 

00:38:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:38:50
MARIA AVENIA ...and in mine and be part of it, so in a way I was learning about the two different worlds, the American culture and again continue with my own. And I did not have the opportunity to have the support from the high school counselor. So to go on to college... 

00:39:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:39:10
MARIA AVENIA ...so I gotta have to do it on my own, but again I was very determined.... 

00:39:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:39:15
MARIA AVENIA ..and so I didn’t give up. Eventually, I’m that a going to you know college and there from transferring to Sonoma State University, and then up to do my bachelors degree in the rural studies and my own history and then went into the teaching credential program, the bilingual teaching credential program... 

00:39:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:39:30
MARIA AVENIA ...while I was in the school system teaching... 

00:39:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:39:35
MARIA AVENIA ...I realized that I did really well, well I did better working with the students and in their counseling needs, so I decided that I wanted to go back to school into the counseling program and that’s how I ended up doing counseling now, and so yeah this little about me. 

00:39:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure and it's sounds like there was a lot of self-driven... 

00:39:55
MARIA AVENIA Hmm...Hmm... 

00:39:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...energy that was behind much of your transition and much of your development and it sounds like that, that’s what’s been guiding for a long time in finding the resources and support. It's hopefully something that you know try to provide others that... 

00:40:10
MARIA AVENIA Hmm...Hmm... 

00:40:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...may have not otherwise received those opportunities because it sounds like not having that opportunity early on kind of drove you to... 

00:40:20
MARIA AVENIA Hmm...Hmm... 

00:40:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...to pay it forward so to speak, yeah. 

00:40:20
MARIA AVENIA Right. 

00:40:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent! And Wannah, maybe the audience can hear a little about your story? 

00:40:25
WANNAH SAM Sure. I was born in 1981 in a refugee campaign in Indonesia. At the time there was a genocide occurring in Cambodia, and most people died and my parents fortunately for them escaped got to the camp, I was born. We got sponsored by, a ranch in Northern California and then we flew there and it was a still later in 1981 and they gave my parents a job and then as soon as my parents got on their feet, the ranch sponsored my parents go to school, so that’s what we did, in we got some apartment and it was a, it was a tough start to the new country because we weren't really greeted too well that time, within there was kind of culturally not sensitive, so there was lots not just verbal, but physical altercations. And, but at the first time, I mean at the time I felt like, and when I was young I could feel the unstableness, so there was about first taste of America which wasn’t good, growing up my parents played themselves not using the welfare system to support them, so they worked in and out most of their, their jobs to try and put some food on table and make ends meet and provide for their kids and along the way my brother fortunately was the one who raised us, 'coz he was the eldest... 

00:42:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:42:05
WANNAH SAM ...so he raised us and he’s about maybe four years older than me, so he was you know old enough to do that, you know at that age. So, he did extremely good job, firstly like when I got into high school things got worse, kind of fell through the, the cracks of the education system are kind of wrong people, going to the wrong stuff and faltered not just academically, but you know behaviorally and just every things go on the train, and I don’t blame my parents for this, 'coz they had to do with the other duties and help us, and then I had death occur, with my friend, who was my best friend and that kind of was a wake up call for me... 

00:42:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:42:45
WANNAH SAM ...I decided that this path I was going on wasn’t healthy for me and the results you know weren't gonna be good. So I did switch gears unfortunately it was during, it was late in the high school year so, I did graduate high school, but it was hard because I didn’t make some a lots of credits... 

00:43:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:43:05
WANNAH SAM Um... I didn’t have any counselors guide me. And that’s what I think, what propelled me to go in the school counseling field because I was seeking that trusting person, someone that would provide me resources or family resources guidance for higher education, I never got that. 

00:43:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:43:20
WANNAH SAM And people like me, like my friends and people I knew hung up and I've then seen them slip to the crack and they come by dozen. So it's not just me, I’m one success story out maybe a hundred. And like I said kind propelled into counseling, went to (inaudible ) got my masters and counseling and my goal as professional is to work with first generation college students 'coz I feel like there’s lots of things society sets out there that are barriers saying you can't do this, maybe it's financially and all that stuff, but I found a way of the new world over and I think they could to. So, that’s one reason why I went to counseling field is to help that, those types of people and also just to be the voice for the, for the families that students are struggling that are maybe social, economically disadvantage or to deprived and that’s my goal to give them a voice and do and solve by looking to the community isn’t that feel like you counseling this is the way I can do it. 

00:44:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And then in your sense I'm getting a strong vibe about overcoming university to get there and being resilient even in some of the most dire and treacherous of situations... 

00:44:40
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:44:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...be it due to psychological difficulty or, or physical violence and the difficulty that that may have. 

00:44:45
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:44:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So, in so many ways I think the three stories that you've shared so far have that similarity, the desire to give to others what may have been lacking for yourself in someway as you made a transition and I guess that's you know be it due to refugee exposure, be it due to transitional exposure, be it due to other types of relocation, be it due to other circumstances that can lead immigrants to in the United States. It's... It's pretty amazing in so many ways to know what has lead you to counseling as a profession and, and how you plan on doing the work of a counselor to provide for others. In terms in general although about why any immigrant client may seek counseling service maybe we can all address this as a group work, what factors or, or variables you think largely bring immigrant clients to the counselor? 

00:45:45
MARIA AVENIA I think, it really does depend on the culture and many of the cultures are not my culture, counseling is not proceed or something you wanna go and do. So most of the times, if immigrants do come and see a counselor it maybe because that immigrant's been referred by a doctor or you know through a clinic. 

00:46:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh…Huh… 

00:46:05
MARIA AVENIA However, I think it's important to consider that, you know I first understand that counseling, counseling is probably not the first option for the families, but it's one that will benefit them. Yeah. 

00:46:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM I think you, you're absolutely right... 

00:46:15
WANNAH SAM Yeah definitely, you know from my perspective it's not how that you can bring themselves you as not how they can come in and seek you or you can seek them. 

00:46:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Umm... 

00:46:25
WANNAH SAM So you have the kind of increase your outreach and try to create a environment that’s non-conducive, and that’s, you know that's not threatening, because on some levels counseling, in many cultures counseling is considered something that’s I don’t know not, not to, you know liked I guess or frowned upon, you know so or shame, there is lots of shame that's big thing to lot of cultures. 

00:46:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Perhaps the sense that you are not able to do something independently or by yourself or... 

00:46:55
WANNAH SAM Hmm...Hmm... 

00:47:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...through the family so it’s a, it's an embarrassment, it’s almost disgraceful thing some one can do. 

00:47:05
WANNAH SAM And pride. It undermines your pride, as a parent, because you can’t take care of maybe not feel like you cant take care of business at home or something and you need that outsider help and some lot of families aren't welcomed to that. 

00:47:20
MARIA AVENIA And it also affects the, not just the parents but the immediate family members, the elders or grandparents in their different cultures people go to the elders for help and has to do with psychological or social and/or that this big person you know that we let it do maybe that the, that they are legend. You know so when they can go to that person or if they do go to that person and they don’t get their help, then again it brings innocence kind of shame and it's, it's not so easy for them to reach out. So you know like one I said definitely important to do outreach and when you do that to be sensitive to that, and then hear their story. You know and it is not that typical approach I believe that you will do as a counselor, but kind of incorporate not just one person that maybe the entire family in the sense, and hear their story first, have them express how they're feeling. 

00:48:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, yeah! It seems like, in many cases, you know people of different cultural backgrounds and what not may take a extreme sense of pride when the family gets involved. And for some counselors that may seem kind of the opposite of what one would expect if you were to take an individual client and bring in other family members in order to address an issue or problem, so I think that's an important lesson especially for audience members maybe to think about in that way and that sharing as you are sharing the concern through family work is, is often times encouraged by many people that are of immigrant status in trying to find resources and ways of getting through tough times, you know. 

00:49:00
MIGUEL LISAH There is a piece of also of normalizing counseling, I think a lot of families, a lot of culture seek counseling as you know there’s something wrong with me or my child, and so you know that’s, that's also although the shameful piece to so I think, for a counselor to normalize it within the school, within the that particular community, ah... if it’s a diversed community, specifically if it’s a diversed community I think it's important and essential for a counselor to normalize counseling and it's just not, not about fixing some ones problem, but also supporting you know the student, with knowledge of how to go to college. You know like I said earlier in my, you know introducing myself it, if your introducing to you know what’s available in this country, you're not going to have an idea so that’s you know to normalize that you know it's, there’s more to counseling than just fix me. 

00:49:55
MARIA AVENIA And in the sense it is not assuming that the family knows what the resources are, but again it takes that, you go and maybe depending on you know your flexibility but maybe go to their home ask for an invitation to their home and bring those resources to them, especially when immigrants are you know both parents are working to a jobs they really busy. So that are the times it's not that they, don’t want to make it to that special meeting they wanna have in this closed system. I mean this close setting but the fact that they probably can’t make the time because they need to come home and cook dinner. So being aware of that as well, making that extra time to reach out to them. 

00:50:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Certainly. 

00:50:35
MARIA AVENIA I think it's really important. 

00:50:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah! I think in general too it makes sense that, well we sometimes think about beyond the scope of the office if you wanna effectively address what some of the needs that immigrant clients have. Ah... The more we wanna think in a traditional role of what a counselor is in terms of where they are located and how they work within the confines of the office. It can be coming out of say out of mind think for an immigrant client and it might even inadvertently send a message that you know counselors aren't trying to reach out or counselors aren’t welcoming on this type of clientele into the office or the process of counseling. So that, I think that speaks well with some of the resources and techniques that counselors need to consider. So it's sounds like we’re kind of heading in this direction already we’re talking about with the counseling relationship, but maybe we can now turn our attention to once they are in the office, once the clients are there and we are engaging in a helping relationship what specific things or you know tips or, or, or best practices would you suggest that our counselors in training audience and professional counselors that have just started in the field should know about how to within in routine you know immigrants clients? Do you have ideas on that? 

00:52:00
WANNAH SAM I think... I have taken them one down position, that I don’t know and not just going off judgments or maybe your past clients that you’ve counseled and stuff I think all maybe because she is a Chinese and this client I'm dealing with or family or working with this Chinese then the part of same thing will apply and they could be totally different because culture it's just not one raises lots of different things and, I think in this society it's good to look deep and down the side and just and just to try, to try to find out where you biases are. 

00:52:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh…Huh… 

00:52:30
WANNAH SAM And try to identify them or work with them before you work with anybody from different back or cultural background and stuff. So just doing that and I think the most important thing is just being genuine and authentic because lot of people can see through a fake and learning how to pick up, up like non-verbal Qs sort of thing because a lot of cultures are very big or non-verbal and not saying anything can mean like 20 sentences, you know. So everything starts with trust. You gotto try to develop that environment where it’s secure and safe and that the client or the families feel like if they are being heard. 

00:53:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh…Huh… 

00:53:15
WANNAH SAM And doing they're in the fashion that, I guess not that detrimental to them or their culture or whatever. 

00:53:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM We are trying to marginalize or put things down. 

00:53:25
MARIA AVENIA Just building the relationship is really important, you know again it being sensitive to their culture that individual families needs or the individual student need, ah... not making assumptions again about the culture and this is one unique individual one in unique family within a culture or a culture group. I also believe that you know once you are there, having the adequate resources would be appropriate. So not only building the, the relationship but, but having information that is gonna help this family, perhaps translated or papers you know in their language. Ah... Being an interpreter you know if necessary but definitely trying to communicate with them yourself and would be really-really important and just being sensitive to what their needs are, you know addresses really all them back. 

00:54:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well I’m glad you spoke that a little a bit too because I think some people maybe under the impression of if I don’t attempt to even try to speak the language that can send a message to clients about that marginalizing or trivializing of things. I think it's important to for, ah...ah... some counselors in training you know to that if you're attempting to try to communicate in a client's language that it's not necessarily something that’s going to be perceived as insulting and if anything helps me maybe perhaps build into the trust that we spoke often. 

00:54:45
MARIA AVENIA The important thing to do is, is be respectful and ask. You know that’s part of building that relationship, asking would you be comfortable with me. You know I knew a few words and can I you know should I get an interpreter. So definitely talking to the client, the family you know. 

00:55:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM You know like the idea of to what you mentioned about having resources I mean sometimes some traditional practices may say counselors aren't really supposed to be in a position to give advice or to make suggestions about particular things. But in this instance having a resource on-hand and available and being able to actually translate it into an action point, helps more in some cases, than would otherwise be the active listening and trying to empathize alone. So it seems like the action speak louder too in many ways than the words that you provide. 

00:55:40
MIGUEL LISAH And then speaking the resources as a counselor just to have keep in mind that your are not alone. You work as a school and so there is gotto be some other person another staff member that might be able to communicate just a little bit better than, than you would. And so you not being afraid to go outside your, your little office and, and maybe getting you know the secretary or a teacher that speaks you know that language, or maybe you start building that relationship more so than, than if you try to you know go out of your way, got your comfort zone, so keeping that in mind, I think it's also a crucial. 

00:56:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure, absolutely! And in terms of I think, would you know somebody like me has gotten from work that I’ve done with, with more particularly the three of you, but also in many cases with students and clients and families that I’ve worked with another cases, as it's, it's okay to need the help. It's okay to be kind of involved in a mutual exchange, not just to provide resources but also to, at the same time get educated, get comfortable and get exposed to and trust developed between people out there, that they have the knowledge in the expertise of being culturally different and being in many ways exposed in dealing with adjustment and change that many times is difficult to, to fully know from this side of the friends with particular identity and particular cultural standards or educational standards that may not otherwise be connected. So what that things what I mean that I think some of the best learning that, that I've done in is by having worked with you on a training capacity. There has been mutual training I think and exposure and it makes a dialogue like this, I think much easier to conduct and as a result to, I think it informs counseling practice and hopefully the audience can find a way of recognizing these points as well. Well, I guess before we finish with this segment are there any take-home messages or final thoughts that anybody would like to share? 

00:57:45
MARIA AVENIA I mean again just that is really-really important that you build a relationship that yeah you are sensitive to this, the particular family you're working with, not making assumptions. You know I’m just summarizing really, it's really-really important. And being okay with sometimes you know, being aware that sometimes bringing an outsider, someone the family doesn't know might be a little comfortable for the family, so that it's okay perhaps to bring a family member to be part of the process and helping them with the resources or in the interpretation, interpreting when it comes to a language barrier. And just to know your community is a really important one. You know good to know that the community that your working with and that will definitely make a huge difference and have productive and effective and resourceful for you and for your clients. 

00:58:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well said! It’s a challenge obviously because there’s a lot of parts of the community, that maybe not everybody gets exposed to at any given time. But I guess the take-home message that I’m hearing as I listen to you all and watched you it's really to basically say, ah... don’t be afraid to join or make connections. It sounds like the trust and the genuineness is, is largely anticipated and if you just do your best as a counselor to, to go with that trust and to go with that active approach to it. You will be surprised to be welcomed you know and who can benefit from you as a result. Thank you all. I mean, I think it's been a... 

00:59:10
MIGUEL LISAH You're welcome, thank you. 

00:59:10
MARIA AVENIA Thank you. 

00:59:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...been a very good learning experience. 

00:59:20
Note how all 3 immigrant professionals: Took a few years to adjust to American culture and expectations Relied heavily on finding support within school and community systems Gained self-confidence as a result of EXTERNAL resources provided to them (i.e. scholarship within school) Had an initial stressful exposure to American culture because of perceived differences Have a current desire to be counselors because they want to display trust and give support to others What community resources can you bring into the counseling relationship when working with an immigrant client/family? Community Agency Vignette: Maria feels overwhelmed with work and child responsibilities Notice how active listening is used to establish rapport in this session. But having an action plan is what largely allows for trust and empathy to be recognized and by the immigrant clients and their family members. 

01:00:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Hi Maria. See I know that we talked a little bit in our previous session about some of the initial struggles that you’ve been having, but how are you this week? 

01:00:30
MARIA AVENIA You know, I’m still having a hard time in adjusting to my new home. You know, I just like we talked about last session. I just recently immigrated ah... from my country from Mehico, and I arrived here with three children and I’m a single mum. In Mehico I had little bit more of a support system, more resources, family members that would help. I wasn’t working as much because I have family members that would help. But coming here I've been having to work a lot, and my children you know two of them are starting school and one of my neighbors is looking after the other one. I just feel really bad leaving them and going to work you know and it is something that we don’t do, back at home as much. 

01:01:20
Genuineness and Openness 

01:01:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah, so I’m sensing a deep amount of frustration and maybe a little bit of sadness about this. Okay, tell me little bit more about what that means? 

01:01:35
MARIA AVENIA It's just, I feel that, I perhaps, been a... not been a good role model for my children. You know when they, talk to their aunty in Mehico when we call and they, they said they miss her and, and they said they miss me, our own mummy and now you know I feel like I can’t be there. I can't be around for them all day. You know like I used to before. I mean in Mehico I worked but it was in the farm and so they came along. But right now I’m working at a factory and I’m working 10-12 hours and I can't bring them with me. I mean I cried but they told me I couldn’t bring them with me. 

01:02:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM They are the factory owners? 

01:02:15
MARIA AVENIA That the factory owners, you know, and so it's really hard that I feel really sad about that. You know, I feel that I’m perhaps not the best mum right now, that they could have. 

01:02:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And so concern that you maybe an inadequate parent or that you're letting your, your children down and there kind of earning for the way things were and it's hard to make that happen with the way things are… 

01:02:40
MARIA AVENIA Uh...Huh... You know I’m also struggling a little bit with communicating, with asking you know for help, maybe I can could come home, for half an hour during my lunch period. But we’re supposed take the lunch in, in the factory and I feel that I’m struggling a little bit with my language. I know a little bit of English because I, I practiced a little bit. I brought a video in Mehico and that’s how I learned of a little English. But ah... I... I also feel like I want to go to school and that to learn more English and to be able to talk to my, my, my boss. You know and be able to go home for a little bit, if I can't but, so I’m also finding that I’m having a difficulty with, you know continue with those plans that I want to have, because again I feel guilty, bringing my children if I do go to school and I feel like I need to learn English in order for me to do better in a different job so I can spend more time with my children. 

01:03:35
Collectivism/Family Inclusion 

01:03:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. And I sense how, you know your children in the world to you and I can certainly see how their family value is, as a huge one. Let’s talk a little bit to, you keep mentioning your plans or how you wanted things to be, in coming to America what were your major plans or goals or what remain your major plans or goals? 

01:03:55
MARIA AVENIA I came to America because I want a better future for my children so my goal has always been to work really hard and have a better job. So my goal really is to have a better job and I realize back in Mehico I didn’t think that it was going to be this hard to have a better job, arriving here and not knowing how to speak the language or how to go and ask for help, because that's something I didn’t grab doing you know to strangers or to people that are not part of my family. We usually help each other amongst the family, so that has been really hard here, you know to, to accomplish my dream which is to have better job so that my children do better too, but it's a struggle. 

01:04:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Sure, yeah! So you're used to keeping things kind of a little family? 

01:04:45
MARIA AVENIA Hmm...Hmm... 

01:04:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And within good resources that are close to home and here it seems like your are having to reach out more beyond that in order to get that goal met, and in so doing it means your are doing something wrong or doing something that doesn’t work? 

01:05:00
MARIA AVENIA Yeah, especially because in my country you know we’re poor over there. I was poor, but I could still survive. You know and here and I didn’t have to ask for help as much. I did it all on my own as a single mum in my country and now coming here I feel like that pride I can have to let it go a little bit and ask for help. I mean for example I went to see my, my doctor because I had a headache and she started telling me, you know how I was feeling and when I was getting this headaches. And I told her that every time I thought about you know my working to be my children and, and she told me that was stress and that it was important that I see counselor to talk about how my feelings and the, the changes for affecting me. And even for me to come here to you right now is really hard to ask for that help. So that’s a huge difference and it's a very hard one and if I was very humble than to asking for help it's, it's big for me. 

01:06:00
Self-Disclosure 

01:06:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And admitting that you needed it might be a challenge therefore. 

01:06:05
MARIA AVENIA Yes! 

01:06:05
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM I’ll tell you in the time that we worked together I mean, I’m impressed with the fact that you've been as open as you have been considering how vulnerable this can make you feel or inadequate in some ways. Because in some ways too I’m getting a sense that we're, we’re getting a sense of trust because you're, you're able to express the concerns and what it means to have to do that, in a way where you didn’t have to that in the past. So in kind of like almost ironically or chance way it seems like by, by being more concerned about being open about here inadequacy and I’m actually getting a sense that these are making you kind of stronger at least in terms of the initial things that we’re doing together. 

01:06:50
MARIA AVENIA Uh...Huh... 

01:06:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM That does make sense as I've said that to you? 

01:06:50
MARIA AVENIA Yeah I think so. 

01:06:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM How does it feel, I like to hear that? 

01:06:55
MARIA AVENIA Well, it makes me feel that it's okay to ask for help, because it’s a sign of strength for me and it does not asking for help according to what you just told me doesn’t really mean that I’m weak and that I should feel bad for asking for help. I guess you know this country known for the you know, the country of opportunity and is providing me with the, a new opportunity and that is to learn and how to ask for help. 

01:07:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And I think that’s important to is that you know opportunity I think in a way you've defined it at least based on where you’ve come from and what you’ve used to doing is that you have to create the opportunity and do it all in your own. And in some cases, you know we do, I think in America a lot of individual effort to get the job done. But it will be very difficult I think for anybody that is away from a country of origin and doesn’t really have a lot of resources that they know of or are completely aware of to just magically figure it out or completely on their own get it done. 

01:07:55
MARIA AVENIA Yeah, I mean it's really hard. I didn’t know where the clinic was, but the migraine educational social worker told me about the clinic and then the doctor told me about counseling services, but another issues that I don’t know how to get to the insurance. How to pay for doctors, and so I really don’t know how to ask for, how to where the resources are. Where the help is. Again my two, one more children are studying school and I don’t know how to talk to in the school. 

01:08:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh...Huh... So I guess with that being said, ah... you know being that you are referred to me through migraine education and I’ve had communication with the social worker. Are you aware of a, of a school counselor or the role the school counselor? 

01:08:40
MARIA AVENIA What are they, I'm not really... 

01:08:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay. 

01:08:45
MARIA AVENIA ...just they sort of mentioned it, the migraine education (inaudible ) social worker but I don’t know exactly how what they would do for me or how they could help my children? 

01:08:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well some of the roles that school counselors often provide in schools is to advocate for children especially ones that are struggling or unreserved in someway, to put the proper resources in connection to what needs to be done in the school so that while there the children feel supported, encouraged and able to at least advance themselves based on what resources they can connect with. 

01:09:20
MARIA AVENIA And if that can to be okay for them I mean you know going to a counselor even like in the (inaudible ) system, you know what they say they we're crazy we go see a counselor like if I tell my mum in Mehico that I'm here right now. She is going to say that I’m not crazy. I don’t need to see a counselor, so are my children going to be okay seeing a counselor or they can be made fine or. 

01:09:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Oh, she and that’s, that's something that I guess that can only best be determined if, if the opportunity is taken and you got a sense of how it is because you certainly have a... 

01:09:50
Recognition of Gender and Power Roles 

01:09:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM ...right to say no if you don't feel that it is proper. But I guess in some ways too is I guess the way you've defined a counselor or based on how, you know lot of people in the family have put forward the idea of counseling. It may not necessarily translate to that exact role here in this community. So some of the work that school counselors do, needn’t involve anything that involves anything that seems like talking about crazy matters or things that deal with mental health. But things that instead deal with finding resources and being supportive and doing things to help people make plans not to necessarily treating symptoms. 

01:10:35
MARIA AVENIA Or for me right now that wouldn’t be the case either, right? 

01:10:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM I don’t think it sounds like that. 

01:10:40
MARIA AVENIA Okay, because like I said in my country, it's not you know I said that as much that I come and see you or a counselor 

01:10:45
Action Planning and Providing of Resources 

01:10:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, as, as a community counselor, is there way maybe that, that I can help play a role that seems to be helping you currently? It sounds like this liaison work that here migrant social worker has been able to do put us together as this kind of established bond of trust. 

01:11:05
MARIA AVENIA Uh…Huh… 

01:11:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM If I perhaps served as liaison to the school counselor and helped you kind of make a connection to that individual in the way that the social worker helped to do that with me, would that seem to help? 

01:11:20
MARIA AVENIA Yes I think so, yeah! 

01:11:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Because perhaps you know because the strengths that I’m getting a sense with you is when the trust is there and the openness seems to be there and you feel like we are trying to be supportive. It sounds like some of that insecurity or embarrassment about getting help kind of let's just say lowers a little bit. Perhaps you know this may translate to, to the school and in so doing perhaps it can be paid for to your children. And some how maybe establish that level of let's say hopefulness that maybe we're trying to have it as a goal. 

01:12:05
MARIA AVENIA Another concern is that I’m working a lot like I said and I don’t know that I'll have the time to come in and have us both go there and so what I… 

01:12:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well I think what you're describing is a valid concern. I mean certainly you do have to keep the hours needed to have your job and the necessary resources that come from that. Ah... But if there is a way that the school counselor can accommodate either through making a nighttime appointment or weekend hours available or some sort of event that's up incoming at the school that would be at least something they could adjust for work hours that you're trying to keep. I could advocate maybe a be good liaison for that and see if we can bridge that gap in that way. Does that sound possible? 

01:12:50
MARIA AVENIA Okay! Yeah, I think that’s a good idea. And also like resources for me you know when I see you I feel that I still struggle a lot with the language. So do you think I could have something in Spanish or from you, you know I’m hard enough feel guilty for example for working so much and not being around my children anymore? 

01:13:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Absolutely, I think there are ways that I can at least try to find resources and I certainly have a list that I keep available and consultants that I certainly try to do my best to speak with in order to make certain people can be provided with as much as they can possibly have. And see I think that’s ironic in a way it seems like the process that I’m doing in order to get the help that I think is necessary for clients like yourself it involves me being open and it involves me in some way trusting that people are, are able to put forth the best effort possible to be helpful and, and not to judge whether or not, you know this is a possibility or something that should or shouldn’t be done. So I guess what I’m saying in a way is, I’m trying to ask for help in a way that suggest that, that it could beneficial for you and in so doing hopefully that’s what a school counselor would be able to do for you and perhaps that’s also a way that people can be in connection with one another so that it's designed to be supportive and not because somebody is crazy or inadequate or unable rather because we see the potential and the genuine desire that somebody wants to have help so let's try to do what we can. 

01:14:25
MARIA AVENIA Okay, and like for resources for example I took my children to school you know because I was going to sign them up. And I don’t have clothes to buy, I mean money to buy them clothes, right now and one of the ladies in the office pulled me outside and told me that I have to get them new, you know change them and get them new clothes because they looked a little bit older, little bit dirty and that made me feel really bad. Because I take really good care of my children, I mean do work a lot. I mean I work my 8 to 10 hours, but I still come home and I cook for them. I bathe them. I take care of them and I change them, putting new clothes on them, clean clothes and it just made me feel really bad that, that was assumed, but I didn’t do that so. 

01:15:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And it sounded like a judgment that was kind of like of... 

01:15:15
MARIA AVENIA Yeah. 

01:15:15
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM class more as a, as a... 

01:15:15
MARIA AVENIA So that kind of scares me to, go get resources. You know I can’t ask her for help. I feel or I don’t know that I want to talk to her because that's gonna make me feel even worse. You know about mum like maybe she thinks I’m not doing a good job, but I know that I am. 

01:15:35
Notice how Dr. Zagelbaum makes plans with Maria and shows actions that can be taken in addition to displaying active listening skills. 

01:15:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Just to make sure I’m following this, was it the school counselor? 

01:15:45
MARIA AVENIA No, it was just one of the school personnel, staff member. 

01:15:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay! So in some way perhaps then I can at least be an effective liaison to address that with the school counselor in way where we can base this on, what I know of your strengths and what I know of your positives and what I know hopefully we’ll translate at least to the school counselor, as a way that kind of mediates that judgment because it’s a system you know, and within any system there are always differences of opinion. So hopefully, whoever it was that would make a comment like that in the way that sounds to be a bit of a judgment more than it is a strength base judgment. Perhaps there’s a way I can advocate and be an effective liaison to find a part of the system that will not hopefully come at you with that message. And at least in so doing hope you feel like there is a little more connection to that and there is disconnection. Does that make sense as I said that? 

01:16:50
MARIA AVENIA Yes, yes it makes sense. 

01:16:50
Action Planning and Giving of Resources 

01:16:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Is that a plan that we could perhaps agree to? 

01:16:55
MARIA AVENIA Yes. 

01:16:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay! How do you feel about that? 

01:17:00
MARIA AVENIA I feel good about it, because I feel like I’m not completely alone to, to go there and do what is right for, for my family. 

01:17:10
Reassurance and Follow-up 

01:17:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well that, that sounds a lot more hopeful than I guess we were initially started the session. 

01:17:15
MARIA AVENIA Yes because I was feeling really lonely and homesick just coming to a different country leaving everyone behind, my mum, and my brothers and everyone I know and the my ways of being there and even food and ah... a very different system over there and here and I feel really sad and lonely, but now I feel that there’s help. 

01:17:40
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Well, that’s good to hear, hopefully more encouragement comes from that process and I know we visit the story probably a few more times and hopefully along the way because you know it's important that I understand where you're coming from to help you, understand where you can go. 

01:17:55
MARIA AVENIA Yes thank you. I think that’s sounds like a great plan. 

01:18:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent! 

01:18:00
MARIA AVENIA Yes. 

01:18:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay! Well then hopefully I'll see you in a few more with out sessions and we’ll follow-up maybe to make a plan about how to get in contact with the school counselor. 

01:18:10
MARIA AVENIA Okay, yeah because I know that doing that will make me feel better. I probably won't feel as sad anymore. 

01:18:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent, okay! 

01:18:20
MARIA AVENIA Thank you. 

01:18:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Thank you. 

01:18:25
When does planning become advising? How does this skill impact the counseling session? Debriefing of Role Play 

01:18:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay, Maria, well first of all thank you for being able to do that role-play, how was it for you? 

01:18:45
MARIA AVENIA It was a good experience that I feel that I was able to express what I’m thinking as an immigrant person that I am while where some of the barriers that I encountered when I first came to this country. And what are some of those barriers or struggles that I see, the family that I work with struggle and so just basing that, on, on, on my ideas on that you know and wanting people to hear what those ideas are and hoping that they are hearing and, and that, they identify those different ideas and supporting the families or the individual client with those ideas. 

01:19:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Yeah and it wasn’t just necessarily about all the thoughts and the behaviors that you were trying to display but also the feelings that kind of made you feel concern inadequate, worried, embarrassed, because it sounded like that had a particular meaning for you as well, to recognize I'm used to doing so much independently and now I have to depend on others and how is that going to impact me is that fair to say. 

01:19:40
MARIA AVENIA Yeah it’s definitely fair to say. Yeah. 

01:19:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And so and so doing that, more particularly worked for you. What was it that I as a counselor did that was particularly helpful? 

01:19:55
MARIA AVENIA Well I felt that I was understood, you took the time to listen, and hear what I had to say, your are sensitive to how I was feeling regarding my children, the, the different changes and the culture and what I was struggling with like having to work longer and having the support system I had in my country and you were able to provide ideas and, and provide necessarily a solution, completely but steps and, and had a good help for that and reassure me that I was a good mom that it was okay to seek resources, so I thought that was wonderful to have that. 

01:20:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Was there anything that you think I could work on or, or try to better articulate? 

01:20:40
MARIA AVENIA No I think that, you were great with the every aspect that I talked about and, and responding to it and to providing with ideas and ways to go about finding a solution to, to the things I thought were issues and so I thought it was great yeah. Ah...perhaps may be a little bit, on, on the language. But I did feel that you took the time to listen and, allow me to take my time to express myself. I was thinking about, if I was thinking about a word, and there is still something I do as an English-to-English learner. I think in Spanish a lot of the time and I think in you know translating in my mind. So I fell that you took the time getting(ph) cut me off, to hear what I had to say and be sensitive to that. 

01:21:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent, and I think that’s a good lesson, I think for the audience to hear as well is that sometimes in our desire to be helpful we end up taking more of a leadership role or, or we try to basically do more explaining and we do connecting. 

01:21:45
MARIA AVENIA Uh...Huh.. 

01:21:45
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM I know at some points they were parts where may be I talked a little longer. But I felt it was more in line being able to summarize, which you were saying and did come up with an action plan as a result of that. And I guess and so not cutting you off, it, it comes more sincerity in listening, in openness then if it were to oh I think I can fix that or this is what I would if I were you. 

01:22:10
MARIA AVENIA Great so I wasn't really told what to do, you know it is just kind of help me with the process and I came across that way. 

01:22:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Excellent. 

01:22:20
MARIA AVENIA In good way. Uh...Huh... 

01:22:20
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And I know you mentioned in the actual role play, there are role, roles and resources in, in the places that people can go for help. I know, I know of a couple of a national organizations, but being that you have had more specific experience with some of this material and some of this localized sort of information. What recommendations do you have? 

01:22:45
MARIA AVENIA Well definitely at the local level, working with migraine education. They provide social workers, community educators. They provide you with medical assistance and they have school liaisons, so if they do have family visitations and they connect the family with the schools or public services etc. Another organization that I can think of is the family service agency. They have counseling for families and children and allow (inaudible ) bilingual. So if that the client doesn't know how to speak English well, they can talk to a Spanish-speaking counselor or other languages depending what is available, but I definitely know that they have Spanish in North California because the majority of the immigrants appear are Latino. 

01:23:35
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay 

01:23:40
MARIA AVENIA For a women to single mother's, the YWCA provides workshops and counseling sessions and resources and tools for, for, for the moms. 

01:23:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh...Huh... 

01:23:50
MARIA AVENIA Social services. 

01:23:50
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Absolutely and I know couple of the places that I’ve come across in national venues for those that aren't familiar with regions like Northern California. The National Association of Puerto Rican and Hispanic Social Workers as an effective national reference for that purpose and also to a certain extent the National Latino Behavior Health Association and so in some ways they perform, if you don't have the specific services I know that you’ve mentioned. There are national agencies that can also service effectively (inaudible ) to get people in contact with other local resources regardless of where they are. 

01:24:30
MARIA AVENIA Uh...Huh... 

01:24:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So at the very least two, I thank you for being… we will put a particular, specific emphasis on resources that are available. Because I think it's kind of an understatement but the more education training and just conversations that we have about this stuff. I think the better work we as counselors can do for working with in for immigrants because they really comes down to being able to benefit and learn. 

01:25:00
MARIA AVENIA That’s correct, I completely agree. 

01:25:00
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Do you have any other final thoughts or messages you like to be able to tell the audience. 

01:25:05
MARIA AVENIA I'll just to continue to work with their families and build the relationship and I’ll be able to provide the resources that the families need and to get to know the families well and just continue to be a great counselor and if you don’t know certain resource you know consult with other counselors. 

01:25:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Uh...Huh... 

01:25:25
MARIA AVENIA Or family service agencies in the county where you live. 

01:25:30
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And I can say to from being the counselor in this role play, I think it's vital and important just recognize that most clients especially ones that now you’re listening will appreciate being able to tell the story and do it in a way where if you ask a question or try to get an understanding of what life is like before immigration and after immigration that it seems to be largely perceived as helpful. 

01:25:55
MARIA AVENIA Uh...Huh.. 

01:25:55
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM And that's something that comes across as a judgment or an assumption of something that’s wrong, which is what I think you brought up in the role play to about the one contact you have with the school staff that may not have been represented of the entire school. 

01:26:10
MARIA AVENIA Right 

01:26:10
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM So it seems like the desire to be helpful is shared by both counseling client if done in a way where we’re trying to come up with mutual help and benefit and not, not one of this is what you need to do. 

01:26:25
MARIA AVENIA Correct. 

01:26:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Thanks again for being so helpful. 

01:26:25
MARIA AVENIA Thank you. 

01:26:25
DR. ADAM ZAGELBAUM Okay.
