THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. With me today, to discuss communication, is Virginia Satir. Probably would be fair to say that Virginia is a living legend one of the founders of the whole movement for family therapy, author of nine books, including People Making, Conjoint Family Therapy, Satir Step by Step, and many others. In fact, an entire discipline of psychology called Neuro-linguistic programming was virtually founded as an effort by other psychologists to study the incredible therapeutic work of Virginia Satir. A… a book called The Structure of Magic describes the underlying principles behind her work. Welcome, Virginia. 

00:01:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Thank you. 

00:01:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to have you here. We're… we're going to be focusing in on communication. One of the points that… that you make about communication is that we very often communicate or… or fail to communicate what we're really feeling inside that… that we… we don't really express what… what our deepest feelings are. 

00:01:35
VIRGINIA SATIR That's true. And you know if that happens, do you know how often we can be misunderstood? 

00:01:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE All the time. 

00:01:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Author, Conjoint Family Therapy And so you don't understand me, and you make me up. So I say that when we aren't really understanding each other, we hallucinate each other, and then we behave as though our hallucinations are fact. That's how we would do it. 

00:01:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And growing up in a family where that's going on it could be very tricky. 

00:01:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh sure, see one of the things I have found, I found this all over the world, Jeff it seems to be I think it's all because we were… we were all born little; I think that's the real problem. Probably it won't happen when we're all born… born grown up, which I don't expect to see happen. But all over the world, the same problems are present. What are some of them? People are expected to know what somebody else means. 

00:02:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We want other people to be clairvoyant, and… 

00:02:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Sort of, yeah. 

00:02:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …to read our mind of course we don't really want them to do that either. 

00:02:30
VIRGINIA SATIR But let me tell you something. If you love me and you don't read my mind, it must mean you don't love me. I… I encounter that a lot. 

00:02:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm yeah I shouldn't have to ask. 

00:02:40
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right, because if you know if you… if you love me, or I love you, we will know ahead of time. 

00:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I should be at your beck and call. Without your ever having to tell me what you need, I should just be there for you. 

00:02:50
VIRGINIA SATIR And you know, when we're talking about that right now, it sounds so ridiculous and yet and absurd and yet, this is how a lot of people function. You know where I think that came from? I think it came from when we were little kids and our parents I often use this, mother was at the top of the stairs, and we were taking and putting our hand in the cookie jar and somebody said, "Take your hand out of the cookie jar." And we got the idea that people could read our minds. Or that we were very unhappy at a moment in time, and mother came in just at that time and patted us, or something of that sort and people could read our minds. 

00:03:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, I'm a parapsychologist. I have no problem with the fact that we are clairvoyant some of the time, but to demand that all of the time it seems to me that maybe we're afraid to ask because of… of a fear of rejection or something of that sort. 

00:03:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Well see, there's a difference, Jeff, between being able to connect with somebody else, and acting on that information without checking. 

00:03:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. 

00:03:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Because we… if we didn't have this thing called rapport between people, we wouldn't be able to even make connections. But the idea that I read your mind, and then I do what fits for me in relation to you, without ever checking with you, becomes a terrible thing. 

00:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It could be especially tricky if you read my mind and you're getting a message which is totally different than what I'm telling you. 

00:04:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly. See and I… I still say to people, look let us we haven't developed the science of ESP that well. So let us not go into a… a basis of thinking that this is what we can do. Let's check things out. If I have a sense with you about something, instead acting on that I'll ask you, "Is this so?" See, that to me is loving, it's considerate, and it… and it opens up a chance for me to learn something about you, and also a chance for us to connect in a deep way. 

00:04:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In… in other words, that's a normal part of healthy communication is checking with a person. 

00:04:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Sure, I think so. 

00:04:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because very often we can misunderstand what a person means. 

00:04:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh yes. It happens all the time. In fact, I think that I can demonstrate the relationship between communication and health and illness, between intimacy and distancing, between competency and incompetency, and between making sense and not making sense and it can all come within the frame of how we handle communication. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In… in the school of family therapy that you founded, conjoint family therapy, you… you send a lot of focus is just studying the way communication occurs in a family, to diagnose what… what that family's problems are. 

00:05:35
VIRGINIA SATIR And as long as that's right and as long as we're on that subject, let me tell you something that came out so clearly after I worked with many, many people. There were two dialogues that go on. One is the dialogue of the words, and the other is the dialogue of feeling and many times those are different. I'll give you a little illustration. Ask me how I am. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How are you? 

00:05:55
VIRGINIA SATIR I'm fine, Jeff. 

00:05:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm. 

00:05:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Now, when I said that, tell me what happened to you. 

00:06:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, you… you had a very cold tone to your voice, so I thought you… you… you were trying to distance. 

00:06:05
VIRGINIA SATIR But didn't you… didn't you hear the words that I was fine? 

00:06:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, uh huh. 

00:06:10
VIRGINIA SATIR All right, so you see, this is typical. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah… yeah. 

00:06:15
VIRGINIA SATIR Or ask me again if I like something, whatever it is. 

00:06:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay, do you enjoy being here on TV today, Virginia? 

00:06:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh, I think that it's just wonderful. Now I'm doing something else. I'm sending out another message about the words that the disclaim what I'm doing. Now, the thing I found out just like in the first illustration, the thing I found out is, those two levels of… of the dialogue come from two different places in the person. They are not an attempt to… to bring trouble… trouble to other people. That's not where it comes. These are totally unconscious. 

00:07:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah. I think you call one level the meta-communication level. In other words, every time we communicate we have a message, and we're also communicating a message about our message. 

00:07:05
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right. Exactly. And that's you see, a lot of people I think it's even been true of psychologists when people give what we call double-level messages, which is where my body says one thing and voice, different from my words, that this is the way to… that this is way to that this is the deliberately done. It isn't. The words come from the left brain what you should do. The other part comes from the right brain. Now, suppose that I have a rule that says that I should never complain to you. So let's suppose I'm in terrible pain and you ask me how I am, and I say, "Fine." What am I doing? This says I've got a rule that I should never complain and it says I have pain. But I'm… I'm giving the message that I what I should do, which is I should never complain. 

00:07:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's as if underneath any conversation, no matter how I suppose abstract or intellectual, there's always a… a human being under there with emotions, often needing to be validated. 

00:08:10
VIRGINIA SATIR That's of course one of the things I try to teach people. I have to tell you something. I go to lectures, I… I mean people presenting things and I listen, and all of a sudden, they may be talking about all this erudition, and underneath I hear, "I'm hurting. I feel disappointed. I would love for you to help me." And it comes out in these very erudite terms. Now, if I were to go to one of those people and just say, "I'd like to help you," the chances are that they would say, "How did you know I needed help? What makes you think I need help?" 

00:08:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They might even deny it. 

00:08:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Sure, because usually people like that have rules they shouldn't ask for help not that they don't need it and this is the kind of stuff that goes on with people all the time. See, I can always see and hear better than you than you can hear and see in yourself, simply because I'm outside of you and then when I share with you what I'm seeing and hearing if that, for instance, happens to meet one of your rules, which is, "I should never ask for anything; I should always be right," etc., then you have to deny what's going on and then if I am not careful, I have to prove my point, and pretty soon we've estranged ourselves. 

00:09:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And in our culture, I suppose one of the very common rules is… is never to reveal what you really feel, especially if… of the vulnerable parts. 

00:09:30
VIRGINIA SATIR Well see if you think that's absolutely true. If you think about it, people's feeling about what's vulnerable is their deep feelings. But most people give themselves "credit" for only having bad things inside, not good things. Or… or… or even you know, I've even found people who felt that they couldn't talk about love feelings because somebody else will be jealous. So as a result, we don't communicate the thing that is really what human beings are about. You know you can put… you can put people on a computer, and they can talk back to each other, but they have no arms, nothing else, you know. But we are behaving a lot of times as though that's what human communication is, and I know better than that. 

00:10:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm One… one of the things that I've enjoyed, as you… you have developed these… these caricatures of… of the stances that people take characteristically, like the blamer or the placater, when we're constantly trying to cover up what we really feel inside and when people are… are always that way pointing a finger at someone else, or always pointing it at themselves, or getting very intellectual or distracting and being silly all the time these are… are modes of operation in which people aren't being you use the term congruent. They're not communicating how they really feel. 

00:10:50
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, this is a way a way that people have protecting themselves. You know I don't know, I have hunches about where it came from. Why do we have to be so worried about protecting ourselves? And one of the conclusions I came to is that I must never get myself into a position where I might have to protect myself, so I lie all the time. I say yes when I feel no, and I say no when I feel yes and so as a result, it's kind of like I am standing on a tenterhook all the time, worrying about what's going to… what's going to be found out, or… or who is going to criticize me, or something of that sort and so the very things that would make it… make it possible for you and I to connect or any you and I can't because we can't be truthful and I'm now talking about truth in the sense… in the emotional sense. I'm just saying how I feel. 

00:11:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And it's hard to imagine that we are going to be able to run our governments, and… and deal with each other is you know in politics and business and nations, when we have this problem in our families even. 

00:12:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, I have said this. We couldn't even begin to heal the world until we learn how to heal the family and we're beginning to learn how to heal the family and one way we don't heal the family is by taking sides. And yet, that's been one of the ways that people have traditionally done it and then, which side is right? So as we… as we move into learning how and now I can tell you about something that I… I think we're moving into, I know I am, and that is how to make an emotionally nurturing triad, where nobody has to win over anybody else, and nobody has to lose, and everybody contributes. See, I wonder what would happen if China, Russia, and the United States were able to be a nurturing triad for the world; or France and England and Russia or what any three people any three countries. Because one of the things I found out when I work with families is that I have to work at making a nurturing triad for people. 

00:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A triad is almost like a basic family unit. 

00:13:05
VIRGINIA SATIR It is the family unit Ma, Pa, and the kid. There isn't anything else. Do you realize that three is all there is in the world? There isn't anything else. Everything is a multiple of three. Think about the trinity, that's a religious symbol. Buckminster Fuller, I was delighted to, he was always one of my heroes; I'm delighted to hear Reagan Brendan O'regan talk about him. He what was the triad? The triad was the basis of the most sturdy building that there is. 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The tetrahedron. 

00:13:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah all right and so the triad is a complete unit and it's composed of three complete units and so you see one thing is that if I grow up, and I… I have I'm not come to a place of feeling an equal part of a triad, then what I always have to do is either feel guilty, or rage full, when I leave. 

00:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And this is something that we all go through in dealing with our own parents, I guess. 

00:14:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes, if… if that's the way we were brought up and you know how to do that, as if you're brought up by parents who have a… a submissive-dominant role relationship, and that can either be mean or benevolent, kind, but it's still a discrepancy. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Between the two of them. 

00:14:20
VIRGINIA SATIR Yes and that's the big thing that… that we have to take a look at now, so that we have relationships that are equal. I was just in Prague and they had the first symposium of family therapy that was ever held there was by the socialist countries, and I was asked to be the president of it and as the president of this, one of the first things I did was to introduce the ideas of how… how equality between people which would result in good family relations and peace. See, those two things go together and it was very welcomed, very welcomed, because everybody knows on some level that if they are equal… they feel equal, a sense of value with the other, that this is going to make a very strong growth… growth link, not a link in which I have to use the gun to you. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE One almost senses that the relationship of a government to its people is like the relationship of the parents to the… the children. It can be healthy or unhealthy. And… and there's a sense in which young children are told, for example, they must obey because the father says so and the similarly with the government, you must obey when the president tells you to do things, must not question. Or you can question, it's as if a… a model for a healthy government would also be a model for a healthy family. 

00:15:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly… exactly you see that's one of the things I found out. If you are brought up to conform and obey, you are never brought up to be an independent choice maker and at this point in time, the ones who really are willing to stick their necks out and to say, "This is what I believe," and at the same time are not putting other people down, will eventually rise to the top. 

00:16:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So in… in effect what you're saying is that in a healthy family, at some point the… the triad evolves to the point where it's no longer parents and children, but it's three equals. 

00:16:15
VIRGINIA SATIR That's right in value… in value and then one of the other important things about the equality is, each one is unique and then… and then… and then really revealing and considering and respecting our uniqueness. You know, a lot of people forget that our fingerprints my fingerprint will be identified will identify me anywhere in the world. 

00:16:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

00:16:40
VIRGINIA SATIR We have five billion people today. We had 74 before that 79 billion different fingerprints. Now, doesn't… isn't that a case for uniqueness? And so when we forget that we are unique beings, and we do not ask people to become the cookie cutters like that you know, did you like a cookie cutter. But that we have a way in which all of us can value each other and learn about our… about our uniqueness and value it, so this is… this is one of the big challenges and I'm glad to be aware, and… and… and that so many people because I stand for this. 

00:17:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think what you're getting at is self-esteem, that this is when we can recognize ourselves and everyone around us as unique people, then we can all feel self-esteemed for our uniqueness. 

00:17:25
VIRGINIA SATIR It's certainly a big piece. You know, that I've just been nominated or not nominated, but picked with 26 other people to be on the Governor's committee Task Force for Self Esteem and Social Responsibility. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes, I think that's very important work. 

00:17:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Well, you know it is going it's… it is important. But that you know, I was thinking the other day, you'll never find a thought or a feeling on the operating table. You just can't find it. But we know that thought and feeling exist. You'll never find self-esteem on the operating table, but what… 

00:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or under the microscope. 

00:17:55
VIRGINIA SATIR No, we never will. But you see, it's an effect, and things follow. It's both an effect and a cause and so the interesting things that not only we but other people have, the things that count in the world, you don't have left-brain ways to put them out. You only have the effect of what's going on. 

00:18:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When we were talking earlier about people not communicating what they really feel, it's often because what they're trying to cover up or in one way or another is low self-esteem, isn't it? 

00:18:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Sure and it’s you know, I right now, when anybody tells me that they want to just be good, I get an awful sinking feeling inside, because I hear them say, "I… I… I want to fit in, and I don't want to rock the boat" and self-esteem for me is the willingness to say where you are and if that rocks the boat, I'm not going to blame you for it, and I'm not going… going to be happy that the boat is rocked. But right now, I read something the other day that if we love our country, if I love myself or love you, we have to be free to criticize it. 

00:19:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We have to be free to rock the boat. 

00:19:10
VIRGINIA SATIR Free to rock the boat and this is one other thing is because I think once we are willing to and able to give out criticism in a real way, without blame, we can also love in a real way. 

00:19:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a tricky thing. I you know, I read an article recently by one public speaker who was telling people, "I don't want your advice unless I ask for it." A lot of people have this attitude, that they don't want any criticism, the criticism any criticism is really an attempt to put them down. 

00:19:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Well you see, I can do that. I can… I know how to… I know how four ways to criticize you in which you'll feel like a worm. All right, just for fun, I'm going to take something… just for fun, I'm going to take something that has no… no effect at all. You have a wonderful tie. I want to tell you that's what I feel okay, for me, Virginia. Okay so now I'm going to make believe that… that tie you could have a better choice for a tie, okay? So okay so if I start out with you and I say, oh "Jeff, I have something to tell you. I don't know no… no if I should tell you or not, but it's really quite well, maybe I won't tell you." 

00:20:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's all… Oh, you can tell me. 

00:20:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Is that tie you're wearing. I wish you wouldn't be doing that. But then, I don’t have… who am I to say anything about your tie? I don't dress that way. 

00:20:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh no, your opinion is important, right. 

00:20:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Oh, are you ready to feel what's going on inside of me? All right I'll take another one. Let see well my god, you're coming out with that tie again. I don't know why you wear that thing all the time, just because your mother gave it to you. 

00:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That one really gets to me. I don't know how to come back on that. 

00:20:55
VIRGINIA SATIR No, but what do you want to do? What's the feeling inside? 

00:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Oh well, I wouldn't mind punching you. 

00:21:00
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly… exactly. 

00:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But of course I wouldn't ever say that. 

00:21:05
VIRGINIA SATIR No, but the point of it is, you see, because we don't say the feelings doesn't mean that they're not going… they're not there. See, you tight… you tighten them in your teeth, and maybe one day you… you… you slip put a knife in me, sometime or you dream about bad things for yourself. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or if I live with you, I get an ulcer. 

00:21:20
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly. Or I could say to you, Jeff, I just took this article out from Esquire. It has to do with the choice men make of ties and I just thought that you might want to have this in details. It has in detail what you need. How do you feel about that one? 

00:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, it's a little easier. I can sort of put it off on an intellectual plane and not take it personally I mean if Esquire magazine. 

00:21:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Do you feel very good about it? 

00:21:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not great. 

00:21:50
VIRGINIA SATIR But at least it's a little less. 

00:21:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE More my style a little. 

00:21:55
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah or I could say to somebody in your presence, "Did you get a load of that? Just imagine, here he is, a fantastic guy, but look at that tie! Can you imagine?" How do you feel about that? 

00:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not too good. 

00:22:10
VIRGINIA SATIR No or I can say, "Jeff, I have something I'd like to share with you. Are you willing to listen?" 

00:22:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:22:15
VIRGINIA SATIR I just was looking at your tie, and I thought, "You've got better ties than that." How do you feel about my telling you that? 

00:22:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's is all right. It's not so bad. 

00:22:25
VIRGINIA SATIR No and See, one of the things is that criticism is never pleasant, but it can be… it can be without blame. 

00:22:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm… hmm yeah I think… I think you were demonstrating here the different personality styles that you enumerated the placating, blaming, intellectual type, the silly type. The last one seemed a little bit more real. 

00:22:45
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah well, it's… it's between two people who value each other. What did I do? I asked you, could I share with you. You said yes. I didn't come in and do what I did before and then I shared with you. Now, that doesn't mean you have to do anything about it, but at least it's… it's clear. We both have the freedom to comment, and you know that on some level. 

00:23:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah in other words, what you're saying is that when people are really connecting at this level of… of being real with each other, being congruent with each other, then criticism can be constructive, it can be healthy and normal. But when people come at each other trying to hide what they really feel, maybe their own low self-esteem, then… then maybe what they're doing is taking out on the other person some of the bad feelings they may have for themselves. 

00:23:35
VIRGINIA SATIR We even have a term for it. What I won't accept in myself which is there, I can project on you and this is happening. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think technically its called dumping. 

00:23:45
VIRGINIA SATIR We are dumping. In other circles it's called projecting. I dump on you what I will not accept for myself. So this is… this is a very important piece and that's see now, what I said at the beginning of our talk together, that communication from me can be related to the difficulties in intimacy, in health, in making sense, and in being competent. I was at… I was at a conference that John Naisbitt and Patricia put on in tell you right now so long ago, and they talked about some of the new ideas about choosing people for corporations to work and one of them is Gore-Tex, which does a wonderful thing and their criteria… 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's an amazing corporation, yeah. 

00:24:30
VIRGINIA SATIR Well you know what their criteria are for choosing people? 

00:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No. 

00:24:30
VIRGINIA SATIR To be kind, fun to be around, and competent all three. So you know I always ask myself, what would it… what stands between me or anyone else in being kind, fun to be around, and competent? 

00:24:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It almost seems like a natural state. 

00:24:50
VIRGINIA SATIR It is a natural state and… and I say to myself, you know why are we busting our necks to… to do something that's that simple? What… what… what is it that stands between people and being kind and fun to be around? 

00:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We often have trouble, I suppose, accepting our natural state. I mean, there's parts of ourselves that… that… that we… we deny, and then… and then we… we get off balance, and we don't we're not kind, we're not fun, we're not always competent. 

00:25:25
VIRGINIA SATIR Well you see, I think we can be and see one of the things I'm interested now is a vision of a new consciousness about people, where we can say and do, we can be kind and we can be fun to be around and competent. There's no reason why we can't. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE No matter what kind of families we came from. 

00:25:40
VIRGINIA SATIR Exactly and I've spent a lifetime demonstrating that, actually. You see, people oftentimes think this is so simple its simple minded. They don't think it simple. But simple minded. Maybe it's the simple things that are going to make a difference. 

00:25:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah that are… that are the most profound and I suppose its… it really is very hopeful for people just to accept, from a person with your background and your experience, that underlying you know all of the sometimes twisted complexities that we feel inside of ourselves, is basic kindness, basic fun, basic competence. 

00:26:20
VIRGINIA SATIR And with that, you can get at the truth. You can get at the truth, and you don't have to hit people over the head. You just don't. 

00:26:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well one of the things you told me before we began the program, and it may be a good note to close on, is that if life can't be fun, what's the point? 

00:26:35
VIRGINIA SATIR Yeah. That's what I believe. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The… the best ways to… to grow and to move towards that kind of competency are… are the gentle. 

00:26:45
VIRGINIA SATIR And with that I just would like to add, the you know plants never grow because you tell them you'll hate them if they don't. We're plants. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah well, Virginia Satir, it has been an extraordinary pleasure sharing this last half hour with you, and… and looking at the your profound and complex realms of human communication, and yet the… the underlying simplicity underneath it all. Thank you very much for being with me.
