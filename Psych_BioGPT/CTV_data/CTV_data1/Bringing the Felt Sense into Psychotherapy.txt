RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, I'm Rich Simon editor of Psychotherapy Networker. And welcome to this Networker Webcasts. And so what we're gonna be talking about today and throughout this Webcast is the issue of emotion and working with emotion in the consulting room. As therapist we're presumably expert on the emotional life and helping our clients navigate through difficult stretches, difficult emotional states. Uh, and that's a lofty goal. Uh, but as we, I think most of us know uh, in our own lives some of us are less than perfect, in our own relationship, with our own emotion. And that uh, therapy often has a kind of um, more of a distance and more unsteady relationship with all the twist and turns of human emotion in our, and our clients emotional journey then is it's optimal. And what we're going to be doing in this series is really looking at a number of different perspectives and other ways of working with clients. Which really help people find the, a relationship to disturbing, intense, uh, intriguing, confusing emotion that helps clients move along and, and move towards whatever goals they're seeking in their lives or discover goals that they may not know they're pursuing. And we're very fortunate today to have someone who has, an expert and uh, a very uh, interesting and useful method of helping people work on their relationship with their emotional lives. Which is called focusing. And our guest today is someone who's been practicing focus for many years, uh, Joan Klagsbrun from Boston. Joan, how are you! 

00:02:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Hello, Rich. Good to see you. 

00:02:00
RICH SIMON So lots of people may uh, be familiar with focusing. Some people may, may not be. So, we're, let's start off, where did focusing come from? 

00:02:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well, it is the work uh, originally of a philosopher and psychologist named Eugene Gentlen(ph). Who studied at the University of Chicago. And he was interested in the philosophy of the implicit. 

00:02:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:02:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And he was very interested in how changed happens. And he noticed as a pneomenalogist that change happens when we can feel more in the body than we can cognitively understand. And if we can go right to that edge of experience, where we can feel something we don't understand, something new opens up. 

00:02:50
RICH SIMON Huh. I. 

00:02:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That was. 

00:02:50
RICH SIMON Go ahead. 

00:02:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So that was how he began as a philosopher. And then he wanted not to just be an academic but to apply his philosophy to um, a practice. And he chose a practice of psychotherapy. He was at the University of Chicago and he approached Carl Rogers. And asked him whether they could do some research together. But first Carl took a couple of years to train Gentlen as a psychologist in his client centered method. So, there series studies uh, in Chicago were really the birth of focusing as a process and a method, and a practice. 

00:03:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON And this goes back so, uh, Gentlen, in graduate school I was already reading Rogers and Gentlen, and Truax, and Carpoff, and the content. All, all that literature that was generous. So this is, this is going back to the all the late 60s and 70s. 

00:03:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Oh definitely, definitely. 

00:03:50
RICH SIMON Okay. All right, so now, um, so focusing is in some ways one of the, increasingly we hear about all the different mind, body, practices in our field. And of course, we all, all a great, uh, all, all in love with mindfulness. And, and we can have a conference with at least 20 different presentations on mindfulness these days. So help us understand, position focusing for us. Let's, let's start off with, with mindfulness to begin with. What's the, what, is, is focusing just another practice of mindfulness? 

00:04:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well, there are a lot of similarities between focusing and mindfulness. And they're very complimentary practices. Many people I know focus before they meditate and some people meditate and then they focus on whatever comes up from it. So, there's just a lot of overlap there. And, and here's some of the ways they're similar. Both of them are about um, using what we call and focusing the focusing attitude being curious, uninterested, and welcoming, and receptive, and inviting, and nonjudgmental about whatever arises and experience, whatever you're experiencing in your body. And, and both of them are very much present oriented. And both of them are um, making a real effort to just notice things as they are and not trying to change or fix anything or push away anything. So in that way they're very similar practices. 

00:05:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:05:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, where they're different is that in, both of them have a kind of a light touch, a gentle light touch. 

00:05:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:05:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But I think we're focusing, there's a little bit more emphasis on the touching. And but, what I mean by that is in, in mindfulness when something arises we notice it and kind of let it go by. In focusing when something arises we make connection with it. We make a relationship to it and we're really gonna spend time opening it up, trying to learn from it. Um, and uh, get some fresh insight from it. And so we're looking and focusing for a sense of release. 

00:06:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:06:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And we get a sense of release um, by working with our issues in a focusing way. Which we'll describe in a few minutes. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And I think that, that's a hallmark of focusing. There's a sense of uh, a kind of transformative moment of feeling a shift, of feeling not so entangled with personal problems. And to get a little different perspective. Um, and to get some release in the body. And I think in mindfulness there's a little bit more about observing whatever arises and, and a kind of letting go. 

00:06:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So there's slightly different emphasis and maybe different purposes. 

00:06:45
RICH SIMON And different relationship to one's inner experience. 

00:06:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Content and to one. And to content as it arises from inner experience. 

00:06:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yeah. 

00:06:55
RICH SIMON So maybe it's, in the spirit of focusing uh, in whatever way you think would be most helpful uh, and, and uh, I, I'm, I was very much looking forward to this cuz I, I had gotten very intrigued with the focusing process over the. Uh, ever since you gave a presentation at the conference this year that one of our senior editors took and found absolutely transformative for herself and reminded me how much I love focusing and one of those things that I have fallen out of practice. So help, help us here. How, how should we get started so that we can all get an experiential sense of what you're talking about. And we can draw back from it and look at some of the implications uh, perhaps later on. 

00:07:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well I, I'd like to at least say a little bit about what focusing is and, and the, and the two important foundational aspects of focusing which are the focusing attitude and the fell sense. 

00:07:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:07:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And then I'd be really happy to take you through an experience. 

00:07:50
RICH SIMON All right. That, that sounds great to me. 

00:07:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Okay. So, focusing is really a practice of inner listening. And it's a way to connect meanings that are freshly coming from present experience, all right. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:08:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And it is also a core process of change that the research that which I hope to talk about later. The research that Gentlen and Rogers did together suggest that it can make any kind of psychotherapy more effective. So I think it can be joined very easily with any other kind of modality any work at all. In both in psychotherapy and coaching, and counseling. So. 

00:08:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN I think that's why it's important for everyone to have some understanding of it. And it's focusing as a systematic way to bring gentle attention beneath our thoughts and concepts, and things that are packaged already, packaged meanings down to a level of knowing that comes to us through the body, right. So, when I say body I don't mean the body as physiology. I mean the body as a repository of memories of feelings, of emotions, of body sensation, of meanings. And most of this is not in the realm of logic, okay. So, focusing is a nonanalytic way to connect to this deeper knowing, this deeper body knowing, this other kind of intelligence that's not encoded in words yet. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:09:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And because of that you can get to places you can't get to through the intellect alone. It's almost as if we have a separate sensory system, you know, we have hearing, we have sight, and we have balance. We also have this sort of body intelligence that we can access and that gives us much more information than we consciously have. You know, I think probably we only have a small subset of what we know in consciousness and yet we can access more of what we know through the body. 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. Okay. So it's, it's as if the, my experience and, and when you and I have, have talked previous to this what's uh, uh, I've been struck by the idea that so, in so much of our life, I like this idea about prepackage. Language offers us up the world these very prepackaged um, you know, this is a Webcast interview that says. 

00:10:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's right. 

00:10:25
RICH SIMON Specific dimensions, uh. 

00:10:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. 

00:10:25
RICH SIMON Where we have a certain amount of time and all of these structures. And what focusing is about is um, we escape the, the, we escape this, this packaging and we discover the freshness of whatever it is that makes something unique and special in a lived moment as opposed to yet another example of something we already experienced. 

00:10:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's right. And for clients if you stay on the level of what's cut and dry of what they already know, many problems can seem irresolvable and very challenging. But when we dip down into this great pool of body intelligence of the what we call the felt sense then we have access to many more possibilities. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:11:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And so Gentlen has this line in uh, in his uh, book Focusing Oriented Therapy, and nothing bad is ever the last step. 

00:11:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And the implication there is that there's always more. And there's always implicit further movement that's possible if we go to this larger realm where we know much more than we think we do or our body knows more than we do. That, in that realm there are more possibilities and um, and, and more possibilities for healing and movement and growth. 

00:11:45
RICH SIMON And, and so before you, you, we have our experience and we invite people into the focusing process is there more that we need to say about what we, you mean, what Gentlen means by the, the felt sense? 

00:12:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes. Yeah, I'd like to say a little bit more about that. And maybe we could contrast that with emotions. 

00:12:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Because that's our topic for today. So. 

00:12:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN I see emotions as the large category of feelings that we would recognize, you know, anger, and fear and sadness, and joy, right. And we sense as therapist when the client is having feelings, like expressing feelings and it's generative and it's healing or it's cleansing, and it's important for therapic movement, right. We can really sense that in ourselves. 

00:12:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But there times when emotions just keep repeating themselves. They get repetitive and they get stuck, right. 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:12:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN A client who cries every session, the person who just stays in anger. And the problem with emotion is that at times we can, it can narrow our experience, right. 

00:12:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:12:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So you know that when you're really enraged at someone even someone you love it's hard at that moment to remember all the good things about them. 

00:13:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:13:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right? Why is that? It's because emotion actually distorts our experience. It gives us one facet of the experience but we lose other facets. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:13:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So again I think emotion is very important for clients to get in touch with and express. But we have to sense is this going someplace? You know, emotion, is it moving or is it stuck? And that's where this other category of experience that Gentlen named comes in. And he named it the felt sense because it's a step wider, kind of a step down from emotion. And it's um, a different dimension. It's not thoughts and it's feelings. Even though it contains both of those. It has a little more distance to it. So it gives us a little bit more perspective. 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Mmm. Lovely. 

00:13:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, so what I would say about a felt sense it's, it's how we hold the whole situation that's W-H-O-L-E, right. How we hold the whole situation in our bodies, right. And we actually even though experience is a very intricate, and there's always lots of facets to it. We can actually get a feel, kind of mood or of the whole thing that we're whatever the problem or the relationship or the issue that we're working on. We can actually, and usually there's a body word that comes that holds the whole thing. Like, it's tight, or it's contracted, or it's jittery or it's jumpy or it's spacious, right. We, so even though there many aspects the body it, we have this human capacity to hold the whole thing. And, and to find a handle for it a word or a phrase or an image that calls up the whole thing for us. And once we have the felt sense, now we don't get it immediately. It has to actually form. So we have to wait there with this sort of gentle attention until it opens up. But when it opens up it, it gives us a lot of, of fresh insight, it gives us new information, and it often gives us little steps of change that I think are in the direction of more authentic living. Because they're coming from this bigger place, this larger intelligence. 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. At least non, non prepackaged living. So we discover It's the difference. 

00:15:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's right. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON In uh, having a road map, it tells you in advance what everything means to the, to discovering in the moment what's going on. 

00:15:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Absolutely. 

00:15:45
RICH SIMON The way (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well put. Exactly, yeah. And we can be very surprised what we find there. I'm always surprised by what clients find when they go to that. It's never what I would have predicted, right. 

00:15:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:15:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Because there's, you know, there's, there's um, so many possibilities. So there some other characteristics of the felt sense that I think that are interesting. I've said that it's first unclear, right. That is when you go there you can distinctly feel something in your body, you know, like um, um, you feel tight or you feel uncomfortable. You can really feel that. But at first you don't know what it is because we don't have words yet there. So we have to wait and kind of patiently. And then it forms freshly, right. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, I said it's about the whole of something, it's not just an aspect. So we can feel the whole of something. And then we want to bring a receptive questioning um, to it. So let it, so it can open up and tell us what it knows. And then we often get new understandings and often a felt shift, where something that at least we hope that something will open up and change. And, and so there's a kind of and then the whole thing feels different in the body. 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:16:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Even if it's a little step. So focusing should always feel good, even if we're working on something that's shameful or painful it was there anyway in the body, right. The body knew it anyway, so it should feel like a relief. 

00:17:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN When it opens up. But I'm talking about this, I want to make sure people know this is something they're doing all the time anyway. We have a felt sense all the time. So let me just give some everyday illustrations. Have you ever had the experience Rich of waking up in the morning where you had a dream but you lost the content of the dream? 

00:17:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You can still feel the flavor of your dream in your body, right? 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:17:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Now if you jump out of bed and hop into the shower you'll probably lose it but if you stay right there, you're bringing attention to something you can't analyze you're just sensing it, right. 

00:17:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's focusing cuz you're just. 

00:17:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Being with something and you're waiting for it to speak to you. 

00:18:00
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:18:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So in focusing we're a listener to ourselves rather than talking at ourselves we're really listening to ourselves. 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:18:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And that's a different way to be with ourselves. 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:18:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Another example is if you're walking down the street in Washington and you see someone you know. And you know this person with every cell in your body but you have no idea where you know them from. 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:18:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Whether they were at your conference or whether you just ran into them at the grocery store. And what's interesting to me about this is that the body already knows whether you want to go an approach this person or whether you want to duck away. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. 

00:18:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:18:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Even before you mentally have the handle for who this person is your body actually knows a lot. It has a lot of memory, experience, and wisdom about this, who this person is, right. 

00:18:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So our bodies are quite wise. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON So is, as we, this all is so tantalizing. Um, I'm wondering can we give people um, if they're like me they're like, let me investigate my felt sense right now. So can we give them a little uh, can you guide us for a bit and then we're gonna, we're gonna talk bring this back and you're gonna talk to us about how you integrate this into psychotherapy. But let's, let's uh. 

00:19:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Good. 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON Good, let's get into the experience of this process. 

00:19:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Great. So I'm gonna lead you through the process of focusing because when Gentlen did the research and it's a naturally occurring process. But he made steps out of it to help people to find the process. So I'm gonna lead you through some steps. I'm gonna leave out the first step cuz I want to come back and talk about that as it's own thing. That one's called clearing a space. 

00:19:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:19:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So I'll just take you through the rest of focusing and we'll, we'll go from there. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON Okay. Great. 

00:19:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, Rich, and anyone else who's listening to this and who would like to be guided, um. 

00:20:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:20:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Why don't you begin by taking a few breaths and you might want to allow your eyes to close. 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And bring your awareness down into the center of your body. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And just say, hello to yourself. 

00:20:35
[sil.] 

00:20:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And now you might ask yourself how am I in the inside right now. How am I on the inside right now. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And feel free to share anything you would like to and to keep private anything that feels like it ought to stay private. Actually when you're doing this with someone they don't have to say their steps out loud but Rich has agreed to that today. 

00:21:25
RICH SIMON So uh, one thing that's just coming up earlier today we had a sort of a jangly experience with these recordings and there was, had a lot of technical problems. And then just this kind of uh, this joyous free feeling of not having to worry about the technical side of this recording and your tone of voice, I feel so invited and all, kind of I can just, just let go, I can surrender this feeling. Fun, positive surrender. 

00:22:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah, that's lovely. So you're already allowing yourself to let of that experience this morning, right. Good. So when we focus we usually begin by choosing something that wants our awareness. So I'm gonna invite you to just see if there's something in your life that you want to explore for just this three, four, five minutes with me. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And that would feel okay with your body to share. 

00:22:30
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:22:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So just let me know and take your time. And let me know when something comes up that wants some loving attention. 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON So the, it's coming up as very immediate is, this is, we're doing this on a Monday the day filled with events, is and assignments, and to-dos is all happening there. So the um, I'm preparing myself, part of me is preparing myself for that. So how to, how to agree to that without feeling too overwhelmed by it. Just sort of like, huh, what. That's sort of, I'm curious about uh, just what we're under, what's, what the day will bring. 

00:23:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, there's, I, I'm hearing things. I'm hearing some curiosity about what the day will bring but also some way in which it feels like a lot that you have going on. There's a lot there that's sort of weighing on you. 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Am I right, am I putting words there? 

00:23:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, all I get is none, or to pack it all in, and all the decisions about what's going on. 

00:23:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON You know, it's not like I imagine experience a lot of folks are having on their Mondays. 

00:23:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes, right. So you're feeling the Mondayness of this day. 

00:23:55
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:23:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN With all of its decisions, all that is awaiting, awaiting you, right. Okay. And so now I'm gonna ask you to stand back a little from that experience and take your time and allow yourself to experience it. How the whole thing about it being Monday feels in your body. 

00:24:15
RICH SIMON Mmm. Hmm, sure. 

00:24:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And at first it's probably unclear and fuzzy. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Then just wait and notice whatever comes. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON So there pieces, the first piece can feel some tensing up at, oh my, all that stuff, all those things that I need to, that are waiting to be done. So there's that. But it's not entirely unpleasant. There's a, there's a uh, there's a positive piece to it also. There's a sense of a, of a positive challenge to it. 

00:25:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
RICH SIMON So I'm looking forward to it. And also a bit of a clinched cling inside. A sense of being clinched, tense. 

00:25:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, so there really are, there, there's the positivenss, the, the anticipation. But there's also a clinched feeling there, right. And you can feel both of those. So, go back and forth and see if clinched is the right word for that part. 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON Hmm. Okay. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:35
RICH SIMON So it's, it, it seems that I'm preparing for it. So can I find the energy and the interest and the curiosity are. 

00:25:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mm-hmm. 

00:25:50
RICH SIMON Get into the, these various tasks of the day. 

00:25:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So clinched, is that still right or is that? 

00:26:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:26:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Shifted a little. 

00:26:00
RICH SIMON The clinched is sort of I'm searching, searching for. 

00:26:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah! I get it. So the clinched is the searching for whether you have the interest and curiosity and energy to face everything that's in front of you on this Monday. 

00:26:15
RICH SIMON There, there you go, that's it. 

00:26:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. Okay. 

00:26:20
RICH SIMON That seems about right. 

00:26:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So let's go back and forth now and see if those are the right words searching for the curiosity, the interest and the energy. 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:26:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Just see if that's, captures where you are in this moment. 

00:26:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:26:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So now we're just gonna keep it company. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:26:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And see if you body sense has anything it wants to tell you. 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:26:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And it may not, that's fine. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Yeah, there, there's uh, there's a it, I, it's as if it felt understood. There's something, there's a positive that comes out of. 

00:27:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:27:10
RICH SIMON Just help me, how you just helped me to find a different handle for it. 

00:27:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. It likes this no handle. 

00:27:15
RICH SIMON Likes it! Likes is fine, oh yeah, let's go with that one. Let's. 

00:27:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yeah. 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON Let see what happens with that one. That seems better than the, the clinched intense one. 

00:27:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes. And that's so typical of a felt sense, there's certain words that it likes and then it opens, right. 

00:27:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So now I'm gonna ask you to ask your felt sense some questions and if they're not right just let them go by. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:27:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And the first one is what's the crooks of this? What's at the heart of this that makes this challenging? 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:27:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And then just wait and let it tell you. 

00:27:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah. And it's, and as you said that it comes up as, am I up for this, am I up for. 

00:28:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Am I up for this. So there's the excitement part and then there's a thing, well what if I'm not up for this. 

00:28:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Both things. But that question, so the question, I feel the question inside me. 

00:28:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So you can really feel this question of am I up for this. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN What if I'm not up for this? 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. Yeah. 

00:28:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's really there. What if I'm not up for this. 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. And that's the negative, that's the fear, like oh boy. 

00:28:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And there's. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON I'm not up for this. 

00:28:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. So there's something there. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And it maybe fear but there's something there. 

00:28:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:28:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN What if I'm not? 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And now maybe we could ask the whole thing, what does it need. 

00:28:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:28:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And see if it can tell you what might ease. 

00:28:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:28:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ease of what if I'm not up for it. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:29:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And just wait and let your body tell you what it might need to make the day go easier for you. 

00:29:10
RICH SIMON It, it, it wants, I mean these, these, your voice, this way you have in phrasing and, and I find myself responding very easily and, and almost instantaneously to what you're saying. So it's the, I'm, I'm, I'm it's waiting for this excitement, it's waiting for a buzz. It's waiting for this little spark of energy that's gonna say, Okay. 

00:29:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. 

00:29:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Okay, let's go. Okay. On, on with the show. 

00:29:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's wonderful. 

00:29:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:29:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN It's waiting for this little spark, this little positivity, this energy to come to say, okay, okay, okay, right. So, now see if you can imagine what a small step in the right direction for that buzz and that excitement might be. 

00:30:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:30:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And just wait and see if there's a knowing there of what that might be. 

00:30:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Something that might open you to that buzz. 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Something that comes up immediately is kind of, you know, my version, focusing. 

00:30:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON So instead of a whole bunch of things happening simultaneously and oh my, this is a bit overwhelming. Okay, start here. 

00:30:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mmm. 

00:30:30
RICH SIMON This thing, this is the thing I will do. This is. 

00:30:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Lovely. 

00:30:35
RICH SIMON It's kind of, and I feel, oh this I can, I can do this. 

00:30:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. So it's like you're saying you need to give yourself the opportunity to come downstairs. And right with, where you're experiencing this and just be with this. That would be a step in the right direction of facing all the tasks ahead. It's just to be with yourself and be with how you're feeling about the tasks. Is that right? 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON That buzz, that pleasant buzz. 

00:31:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Oh and. 

00:31:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:31:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And be with the pleasant buzz I see. 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON I'm there with it. It's focused, it's there. 

00:31:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:31:05
RICH SIMON And I haven't lost that nice sense of the pleasant buzz rather than the, am I up for this. Oh it's the buzz. 

00:31:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON Oh, all right. Pleasant buzz. 

00:31:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah, so you're. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON There you are. 

00:31:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Really looking for that buzz that came there, that would be a step as to really find that in yourself. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON That's it. 

00:31:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN It would give you the energy and the curiosity, and the interest to go through your busy day. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON That's it. 

00:31:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. 

00:31:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So be thankful for whatever came. 

00:31:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You might want to be and then to just see if this is a good time to end this little round of focusing. 

00:31:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Mmm. Great. Yep, lovely. 

00:31:50
[sil.] 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. Hello, how are you? Hello, Networker folks, who's ever out there. Little interesting process. 

00:32:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So I do think that um, Gentlen was really very wise to take this naturally occurring process that he found that people had uh, some people had in psychotherapy when he did research and to develop this protocol to help other people to find this place. 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:32:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And I think it's, you know, it's designed to, to help you listen very deeply inside to what, what your body and your intelligence knows. Your nonverbal intelligence knows. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. Yep. And also what's, what stood out is I'd been there um, you know, a thousand times in one way or the other. But there's something like rediscovering with your help a way to be there, go there uh, that seems both extremely familiar. 

00:33:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. 

00:33:00
RICH SIMON And actually brand new at the same time. 

00:33:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Oh, how lovely. Yeah. Well the thing about focusing is it's always fresh, right. It's always creative because it's coming in the moment. 

00:33:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So the felt sense isn't something that's been hanging around all week, right. It's something you just got in this very moment. And I think being in touch with something that, that's freshly arising is very unlivingling. 

00:33:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like it's a beginning. It feels like that. 

00:33:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes. 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON There's the excitement. I you know, I've always liked that I think many of us like this idea of there's something inherently, unless the default response to beginnings is, hey this is great. We did it. 

00:33:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh, yeah. That's lovely. May your day go well. 

00:33:45
RICH SIMON All right, well you got this interview off to a great start. So, so now we've got and, and uh, hope folks had whatever their version of this experience. They can really begin to, to feel what you're talking about and, and we're getting this in our bodies. So, take us into the kind of the next step and whatever demonstration or however you want us to, to be able to really feel, get a felt sense of what you're talking about, you'll, you'll let us know. But as a therapist then, so you have this tool and you're orientation as a, a therapist in addition to your interest in focusing. Is there a particular model of psychotherapy, is there a particular kind of specialty area that you have? 

00:34:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well, I would consider myself a focusing oriented psychotherapist. 

00:34:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:34:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And I use the way, the word oriented um, I take that seriously because I orient myself always to what's right over the horizon of awareness. And I'm interested in helping people to get at this level of experience that I think is so fruitful and productive, um, juicy. 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:35:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, because that's where movement happens. I think that's where change happens. And um, so, it looks very different from client to client. Occasionally I'll use the focusing process as a whole, as I just did with you. But more often I just kind of sneak in aspects of it. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, so because I think there's, to teach your clients something is, put something between you and the client. So I more use the principles of focusing to help people to um, be able to dip into this, this place underneath their words and concepts and thoughts where I think more can happen for them. And the direction of healing and wholeness and sometimes solving problems. Sometimes getting a big perspective on things. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:35:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So I would say that's my orientation. But I want to say that in the focusing community there are people who are relational psychoanalyst, people who do short term therapy. Um, every variety and modality of people can, behaviorist. So it actually is very, a skill that's applicable in many different arenas. 

00:36:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:36:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN In therapy and also outside of therapy. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN It's being used in 43 countries and it's being used uh, to help people in developing countries, NGOs in Afghanistan, Pakistan and El Salvador, and Ecuador. There big focusing programs in those places where people are being taught focusing. And of course in each culture it's changed a little bit but interestingly it's not uh, relevant what your educational level is. There aren't categories of people who can't do focusing. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Some people have a natural ease. You're obviously good at this. Um, but um, everybody can, can learn it and profit from it. And in therapy what's most important is that the therapist knows how to focus. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN All clients don't know how to do that. And we'll talk about that in a few moments when we, when we get, get into that. 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:37:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, focusing actually began with this research on psychotherapy. So maybe I could just take two minutes or three minutes. 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:37:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And, and tell about that. 

00:37:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:37:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN As I think it's an interesting beginning. Um, so Gentlen and Carl Rogers got together and they asked a question that's still a very good one today, uh, 40 years later. Which was why is that some psychotherapy is effective and some isn't. Some people go through years of therapy and nothing changes. 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:37:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So they looked, they had uh, the old fashion uh, reel to reel tape recorders, and they taped hundreds of hours of different kinds of psychotherapy that were practicing in Chicago then; psychoanalytic, and client centered, and English felt therapy, and other kinds. And what they did was listen to 5 to 10 minute segments of first and second sessions. And interestingly they were able to predict who in a year's time would get better. 

00:38:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:38:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And who wouldn't. And their metrics were the self report of the client and the therapist uh, evaluation if the client made serious or real and lasting change in, in therapy. 

00:38:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:38:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And what they found was it had nothing to do with the kind of psychotherapy and in those years people really did practice their kinds of therapy, right. We're all more eclectic now but. 

00:38:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And it had nothing to do with the content of what the, the client was talking about. Whether they were talking about their early childhood or how they felt about the therapist, or what they did that week. That was irrelevant. 

00:38:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:38:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So the relevant critical factor that predicted success in psychotherapy was the manner of experience, how the client was speaking. And there were successful clients who right from the start, the first and second sessions, were one's who could speak from their feelings rather than about them. And who could touch into this realm that is later called the felt sense, that at the time was just a realm of reference something that they could check against and see if it was right, right. 

00:39:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Hmm. 

00:39:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And those people did well right from the beginning and got better. Other people who didn't know how do this process start, were, were rated low at the beginning of therapy and they never learned it through therapy. So, that's were Gentlen got the idea that he would make a protocol to teach it to clients so that they would make better use of psychotherapy. And there have been a lot of studies that've shown that it is teachable and that when people know it they have success in, in therapy. And it makes sense because it is really the essence of any good therapy, right. 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN When we can touchdown into something that's more than on the surface level or more than our narrative. And can really get in touch with feelings as, and, and listen to them and speak right from them. So let me give you an example of what such a person might have sounded like who was, who did well on that ratings scale, which was called the experiencing scale. And the experiencing scale was looking at people's capacity for being with experience within that wasn't yet clear. And that, who could stay with it, question it and find meaning from it. 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:40:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN In a bodily way. So that was the scale they used. So. 

00:40:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Person who was high in the experiencing scale from the start might have sounded like this in a session. You know, um, I'm so pissed at my sister. She's drinking again. 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN How could she be drinking again when we just saw our father die from alcohol. 

00:41:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, I'm just pissed at her. I said it, now I can feel it in here. It's more like um, I don't know what it is. It's um, it makes me sad. It's so damn disappointing, yeah. 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:41:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's what it is. 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So these people, knew how to reference something that they could feel. 

00:41:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:41:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And, and check it against themselves. And so they didn't necessarily use the most tissues in crying in therapy. 

00:41:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN They didn't have the most intellectual insights, right. They're the ones who could kind of grope their way towards something that was res-, deeply resonant with how they were holding it inside, how they were holding it in their body. 

00:41:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. So it's kind of uh, uh, and uh, and to, to focus this on, on the uh, our, our theme of our Webcast are, what you're describing is this certain kind of conversation that they have, and I'm using that in a broad sense. Not certainly. 

00:42:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Absolutely. It, right. 

00:42:05
RICH SIMON People have this conversation in kind of relationship they could have with their experience that might shift from moment to moment. In a, in terms of uh, our, the, the overall topic for our conference about emotion, and working with emotion, and how to help people regulate their relationship with emotion. Talk to us about some of the ways some people are too intensely emotional or caught in the grip of emotion. Like you're talking before about the quite narrowly for some of us who are a great distance, we don't really get a much of a felt sense of ours. Take us through some of the various ways you as a therapist help people shift their relationship with their emotional states by using this tool. 

00:42:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's a wonderful question, Rich. And I think uh, focusing is very helpful in be-, in helping people to befriend their inner experience. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And to develop the right relationship to it, you know. 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Most of us have uh, one of two ways that we deal with feelings. Either they're sitting on our lap or breathing down our neck and we're feeling overwhelmed by them, right. 

00:43:15
RICH SIMON Breathing, that's a tough one that laugh and breathing on the neck one but I get it. Okay. It's a little untangling, well, okay. 

00:43:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Or they're down the hall in a closet we have locked away and we say we're gonna get to them but we never do, right. 

00:43:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, true. 

00:43:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And what I find that focusing is very useful for both kinds of situations. Both kinds of the spectrum. 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:43:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, when you have somebody who's drowning in emotion that's too intense, too heavy, too present, they're feeling tremendous fear or anxiety or drowning in their sadness, right. We have ways in focusing to spatial metaphors for starting that says, let's sit down next to it, right. 

00:43:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:43:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Let's see if we can find a way to make a space for it, to be friendly to it. Um, because we want people to not, when people are overwhelmed by emotions often it's because they're overly identified with that emotion, right. I am sad. I am depressed. As opposed to I have sadness. So by having people have a spatial metaphor, sometimes I even say, let's see where would you want to put that fear of the recurrence of your cancer. We want to work with it today but it's so close, where would you like to put it? And then they might say, put it behind the couch, right. 

00:44:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:44:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And we, and, and, so I often say to people you want to get it just back up enough so you get a whiff of it but that you're not overwhelmed by it. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:44:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And uh, Gentlen had a wonderful phrase that I love, "You don't have to stick your head in the soup in order to smell it. 

00:44:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:44:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So we really want to help clients get a whiff of whatever it is because if we don't have a whiff of it, it's hard to work with it. But if it's too intense you can't work with it either. Okay. 

00:45:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:45:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So there a couple of ways to do that. One is the spatial metaphor. You know, place it the right distance away, make a friendly space for it, sit down next to it, put your arm around it, right. You know, there are ways of helping people to distance. And then um, you also want to uh, sometimes you ask people to locate it in the body, right. So where are you feeling that. And it's very grounding to say, well I'm feeling it in my throat my throat is tight or my chest is feeling clinched. Um, because you, then it's not all over, it's in one place. 

00:45:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And even sometimes we can ask people would you like to put a gentle hand there? 

00:45:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You know, to help, help them ground themselves. 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN In, in the emotion. So that's one way. 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And then another very good way that comes from the work of Ann Wiser Cornell is to use facilitative language. And, and that can really help a person not be so over identified with an intense feeling. And. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON Let me just do, do something there. Okay. Sorry, go ahead. 

00:46:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's fine. One of the magic words to use that we often use in focusing is the word something. So if you come and say to me, "Joan I'm overwhelmed today, I have so much to do." I would say back to you, "So Rich something in you is overwhelmed today." Or, "You're sensing that something in you feels overwhelmed today." 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. Can you feel the difference between that? 

00:46:30
RICH SIMON Mmm, Mmm. 

00:46:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That by saying, something. 

00:46:35
RICH SIMON And that's as facilitator and you're, you're describing this as facilitative language. 

00:46:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Facilitative language that's gonna help you have a little bit of distance. If I say something in you is overwhelmed or something in you is depressed or sad rather than you're just depressed, right. 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You real-, there, I'm implying that it's not all of you. 

00:46:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And that can be very useful. 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:47:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And there are other phrases that, that have been used a lot too. Like a part of you, a part, maybe a large part but it's a part of you or there's a place in you, right. So all of those methods, the getting the spatial distance, uh, locating it in the body, and the facilitative language all help with very overwhelming emotion. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:47:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But then there's the other kind of clients, right. The ones that come in and have a lot of trouble tolerating any affect who um, cut off from their feelings, warding it off. Maybe afraid of their feelings. And we have ways in focusing and working with that too. So. 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON So Joan, just uh, we're having technical adjustments here. Your, adjust your mouthpiece a little bit because you're. 

00:47:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Oh. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON There nice, that's, I think that's better. Yeah, good. There you go. Loud and clear, good. 

00:47:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Thanks for letting me know. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:47:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So you have someone for example who might come in to your consulting room and say, well three years and he just broke up with me like that. 

00:48:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:48:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Just packed his bags and moved out. 

00:48:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:48:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Huh, but I guess it's for the best. I guess it wasn't gonna work out. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So a client like that I would be using my felt sense and saying, "Wow, when you say that I just felt my whole body tense up like I'd been hit by a truck." 

00:48:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:48:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN I'm wondering how it was for you in that moment when he's gone and you're just in that, just place of noticing how drastic this is. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:48:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And how unprepared you were. And I'm imagining etc. So, I'm using affect in my voice and in my words to try and help the person kind of get a little bit more embodied, right. 

00:48:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But it's a very delicate thing when someone has warded off emotions. And so we want to be very gentle there. And it's like we want them to be able to turn the faucet on but to have some control. Because they're afraid of being flooded. And so we want to be very respectful of saying, so just notice there and whenever it doesn't feel right just, we're gonna back away and get the comfortable distance away so we can work with this. 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:49:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And maybe the person will be able to sustain that for only a minute or two at first. And then we'll go back to telling a story or go back to being shut down and that's fine. It's never a pushing it's always just an inviting and seeing if there's that possibility for having a more embodied awareness. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. And, and so do you find that um, with some people have no idea what you're saying, felt sense, what's that. 

00:49:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. Absolutely. So she was this example I gave was a woman like that, right. 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:50:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN If I had said to her you know, take a moment and sense inside. She would of looked at me like I had two heads, right. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:50:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But by using the felt sense of a therapist. 

00:50:05
RICH SIMON Ah. 

00:50:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And empathically and in a tuned empathic way then we can co-create the environment where it feels safe enough for the person to check within themselves. 

00:50:20
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:50:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And for some clients it happens, they're natural at it. And you mostly want to stay out of their way. 

00:50:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But for uh, some clients we have to kind of do focusing in thimble full's. 

00:50:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:50:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Just a little bit, you know. And you don't lost anything by just, sometimes reflecting something twice on the felt side of it. 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:50:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So you, you know, you say you're really anxious. So you're really anxious there and I'm wondering if that's the right word for it. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Is that right. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:50:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And by asking a question like, is that the right word for it. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:50:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN There's only one place to go to answer that. 

00:50:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:50:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And that's to check within. 

00:50:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So there are ways we can very subtlety help people who are not naturally introspective to make good use of this approach. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. And, and so at the beginning of a, say one of the things it always, it always occurs to me is uh, particularly those of us who and I count myself in this crew, of people who get too focused on language. Is that, that uh, we begin the chatter of the therapy session and that, that gets us off in some direction where what needs to be said the word deeply felt experience, whatever it is gets lost. So, when you're, is there a way which when you begin your psychotherapy do you have certain ways of beginning sessions that move people more easily, more even more efficiently into uh, this awareness of felt sense of which this kind of exploration can more easily go? 

00:51:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes, that's uh, a great question. And um, I would say that for some clients they just take a moment of silence. That's often a good way. Um, some people are just, come in more centered and they know what they want to share and then we can go there. 

00:52:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But there's certainly are clients who come in and they're scattered of they have so many different things to share. And then I find that the first step of focusing which is called clearing the space. 

00:52:25
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:52:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Is a wonderful way to begin. And I don't label it and say, now we're gonna do this process. I just say something like, you know, there's a lot that you're bringing in today. I can hear the many concerns and issues. And I'm wondering if we could just begin by taking a little bit of an inventory. And to just notice what's there for you. And um, maybe you and I can do this. That would give people a sense of that. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Okay. Yeah. 

00:52:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Okay. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON I'm ready. 

00:52:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, so Rich, um, so you've just come in and I know you got a lot going on. 

00:52:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Maybe it would be good for us to just sort of notice what's there and so, we're gonna just take a moment to bring your attention down into the center of your body. And just say hello to yourself, greet yourself. 

00:53:20
[sil.] 

00:53:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And I'd like you to begin by actually remembering a time when you had a sense of wellbeing or a sense of peace. 

00:53:30
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:53:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And just remember what that was like with all your sense. What you could smell or hear or see. 

00:53:45
RICH SIMON Hmm. Yeah. 

00:53:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Might be. Yeah, you have that, that sense. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Yep, yeah that's nice. 

00:53:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So now we're gonna ask you what's between you right now and that sense of peace and well being. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:54:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And if nothing's in between of course, just stay right there. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But most of us are carrying problems or issues or burdens. And we're gonna just take each one that comes up one at a time. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So you might just notice if there's one thing in the way between you and feeling that sense of well being and peace. 

00:54:30
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:54:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And please don't fall into it, just notice it, maybe there you're holding it in your body. Or if there's a name. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You have something there? 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. I just, I just have a um, uh, a quick flash of a friend visited last weekend. A uh, Saturday morning, went to a market. The day is beginning just this, that beginning. Here I am, I'm at the beginning. So everything else is there waiting in the background and that lovely sense of being at the beginning of something. 

00:55:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's lovely. 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON Anticipated, positively anticipated. 

00:55:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Wonderful. And then when I ask is there anything in the way of that sense of well being. I'm just wondering did something come there. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. The, the you know, the, the rush of, of uh, I can't spend too much time at the beginning I have to move to the next. 

00:55:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Okay. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Thing, so. 

00:55:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So let's take the whole thing about the rush. And see if you can make a package out of that and place it at the right distance away. We're gonna place it for the moment outside of the body, like we're giving the body a little rest bit from that. 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:55:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN The whole thing about rushing. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And really notice what it would feel like to be you inside without that. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:56:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Let's see if you can get a, a little breath there, a little more space. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Well it, it took certainly is like clearing a space. 

00:56:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You're clearing a space. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Clearing a space. There's not, being crowded by the future but just clearing a space to be there right now. And it's okay to be at the beginning of something. And not so crowded by what's the next thing. 

00:56:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Wonderful. And so now just bring your attention back inside and say except for that, am I all fine. And again just wait. 

00:56:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And see what comes in the body. 

00:56:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. And, and the thing that comes is in this, this has come up throughout this time that you've been listening to you and working with you in this way, having you guide the process of this way. This quality, this friendliness. 

00:57:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mmm. 

00:57:00
RICH SIMON There's a friendly, this friendly presence. 

00:57:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mm-hmm. 

00:57:05
RICH SIMON That I can generate, you, you generate so naturally this, this feeling of a friendly presence inside. It's a very nice company to have. 

00:57:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So you're really feeling that friendly company. It's like it's whatever's there is just fine. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. 

00:57:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's great. So, I'm just wondering is there another issue or concern that you can notice on the body that's between you and feeling fine? And there may not be today. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN We'll just see what's true for you. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah, it uh, it's, it seems there may be storms on the horizon a little further on but in this vicinity now there's this space is cleared. And I, I can be ready to go on to the next step and that's something. 

00:57:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's, that's great. Good. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON Could, could clear my space again. 

00:58:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That, that's great. So, I would just say in addition to those issues that we carry most of us have a background sense always feeling little too busy or a little sad. And I'm just wondering if there's a background sense that's typical of you that you're experiencing right now. 

00:58:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:58:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And see if you can just wait and see what comes. What's a background, like the flavor. Almost like the wallpaper you don't see any more cuz it's there all the time. 

00:58:30
RICH SIMON What a great question. I like this, yeah. Okay. Uh, I, I can uh, it seems like a great uh, question uh, and a great thing to. 

00:58:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, does something, does something come there then? 

00:58:50
RICH SIMON There's, so two things come. So one is that, when is the background sense of expectation of excited expectation. 

00:58:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

00:58:55
RICH SIMON Uh, and the, and a sense of uh, eagerness. 

00:59:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:59:05
RICH SIMON So the next thing. And then um, uh, uh, a kind of girding for oh my, what's in the um. 

00:59:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON Uh, what's a little further down the road or maybe it's gonna be a little more than I can handle. 

00:59:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. So. 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON So. 

00:59:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Do you have? 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON Both those things, yeah. 

00:59:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Both those things are there. And we really want to give space to each of them. There's that expectation and excitement, and curiosity. And then there's also this girding feeling. 

00:59:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:59:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN About will I. 

00:59:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:59:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Be able to handle that, right. 

00:59:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:59:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So let's make a package out of that and see if you can see what it would be like to be you without that girding feeling. 

00:59:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:59:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And see what it feels. Is there some way you can imagine putting it at the right distance away. 

00:59:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:59:55
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Where you'll be able to pick it up again but right now you get a little breather from it. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. Oh, it's very light. 

01:00:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh-huh. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON Very light, and light, carefree. 

01:00:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Nice. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON Young. And now it feels, you know, just that, that, that, all the excitement of beginnings. Feeling at the beginning of whatever happens to be. 

01:00:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Mmm. So I'm just gonna invite you then to spend 30 seconds or so in this clearer space. 

01:00:25
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:00:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Where you don't have to do anything and just allow yourself to be. 

01:00:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And many people find in the space that they're not their problems even though they have them. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:00:45
[sil.] 

01:00:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And before you come back maybe you could just notice if there's a word or a phrase or an image, or a gesture. Something that would ask as a handle for how it feels in a clearer space. 

01:01:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:01:10
[sil.] 

01:01:10
RICH SIMON Just like a. 

01:01:20
[sil.] 

01:01:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, just that bring it on. Just. 

01:01:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Ah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. What, what a beautiful, what a beautiful gesture. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:01:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Openness and movement, right. 

01:01:35
RICH SIMON Openness, right. And uh, that's, that's, that word hadn't occurred to me. That, that really, that connect with a kind of sense of openness. Okay, what's this. Oh, there we go. Great. 

01:01:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN But I like that you symbolize it with a gesture because. 

01:01:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:01:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Gestures are uh, such a. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:01:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Wonderful symbols, right. Yeah. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:01:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So then in therapy uh, once we did that little process which you know, would take anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes depending on the person and the amount of packages they had that they wanted to. 

01:02:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:02:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Know. Uh, then we might just go on in therapy and I could, they would have kind of taken an inventory. Uh, and also had a moment of being having a little bit of sanctuary. 

01:02:15
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:02:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And that feels very important um, because um, his, as Einstein said, "We can't solve a problem with the same consciousness that caused it. 

01:02:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:02:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And so in this clearing a space we're really changing our consciousness. We're changing our perspective, right. And I have found that to be particularly useful uh, when people are going for serious illness. That having a chance to put down the cancer or put down the whatever. 

01:02:45
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:02:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And to just find what else there is that's in the way of feeling fine. And then to have a couple of minutes of feeling all free, all clear and fine becomes a very positive resource for being able to live life with lots of challenges. And so that the more people do this process the more they are able to call up this resource of a clear space. And um, some colleagues and I actually did a couple studies and research studies done with women with breast cancer um, using just this clearing of space. We found that after six weeks that they had better mood, more energy, they were functioning better, they felt more equanimity, more calmness. So, it's a prac-, this is like a little practice that people can do. It's an optional step in the focusing but by itself I think it's very stress reducing. 

01:03:40
RICH SIMON Oh my. Yeah. So it, it, what I have experienced uh, throughout this certainly delightful hour with you is the, this sense of discovering but things that extremely familiar and seem absolutely new and that the uh, um, that his capacity to shift consciousness seems a breath away. We keep, we keep uh, within a few moments of as we move through the different kinds of practices that we've been doing together. There's a different consciousness there that can take me to a completely different place, so that's. 

01:04:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN It's great. 

01:04:20
RICH SIMON That, that seems uh, something you're, you're a real hallmark of doing this um, this kind of work. And, and the way in which your working with between the implicit the nonverbal, the unstated, and the, the language. 

01:04:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN It's a zig zag, it's a back and forth. It's not just going there and staying there. It's having this conversation. 

01:04:45
RICH SIMON Yes, conversation. A very different kind of conversation. 

01:04:50
JOAN KLAGSBRUN An inner conversation between your everyday consciousness and then what the body knows. Yeah. 

01:04:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:04:55
RICH SIMON Gentlen calls it the upstairs and the downstairs. 

01:05:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And we bring it downstairs to have a conversation. So, I, I wonder if I have, if we have time I haven't been watching the time for me to share some couple of ways to integrate this. 

01:05:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, we have, we have, we're coming to the end of our time put uh, take us down the home stretch here. 

01:05:15
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh, okay. Uh, so the first thing I would say, the first way to use focusing is to just noticing when your clients are right at that edge where there's, where they're just opening to the felt sense because many people get there and then they back off, right. Because it's unknown territory. And so it's very helpful to be aware of when clients are right at that edge and to help them to stay there with it. So it's important then to, then to notice the hallmarks of when they're at this place and it, they're often when a person slows down their speech, says I don't know how to say this. Maybe uses their hands, uses metaphors, um, gets groping, stops, slows down their speech. So all of those are signs a person might be coming to this very fertile place. 

01:06:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:06:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Uh, where if they could stay there it would tell them more. 

01:06:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:06:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And we might just say gently, "So maybe you could just stay there for a moment and see there's something there that's not clear. 

01:06:15
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:06:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You can't concentrate on writing and yet you want to. And just see if words come that capture how it is when you're sitting at your computer, right. And to get really back to the experience. So that's one way. And um, and then when clients are telling stories and they're very far from getting to that felt sense level of experience you might just ask them to um, to, to notice what comes in the body right there or to what comes inside. So an example would be a client who's saying my mother's, a young adult client, my mother's coming to visit. I'm dreading the visit and then she goes on for 15 minutes about the way it's been disastrous in the past. And how she, what she's worried about and so forth. And then I might say, so you've said everything about that and sounds very complicated and challenging. And I wonder if you could just take a moment to just sense inside and see what comes there when you say, my mother's about to visit. 

01:07:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:07:20
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And just wait there. And sometimes I even use a little shortcut I say, tell yourself it's gonna be great, even though you know that's not true. And often when you do that, when you say to yourself. 

01:07:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:07:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Oh this visits gonna be fine. Ugh, all the ways the body knows isn't comes up. 

01:07:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:07:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So that's a little shortcut. But and then once I have the person there then we can begin to work and explore this inner territory of the deeper feelings and the deeper knowing. 

01:07:50
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:07:50
RICH SIMON And so we start with the bodily sense. And so in this particular woman I'm remembering I asked what, what comes there. She said, "I feel nauseated." 

01:08:00
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:08:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You know I feel like I wanna throw up. And so I say that back to her. Cuz we always want to sort of resonate it and see if its right. And then she said, "Well, now it's in my throat. I'm feeling kind of choked up about it." And then we worked with the choked up feeling. And it turned out that there's feelings there that she was afraid to express. And she got in touch with what that was and was able to do that more easily than. 

01:08:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:08:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, then she would have had she not really come into her body to get this information. 

01:08:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Mmm. 

01:08:30
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So, so we invite people to do that. And when people can't do that then we as therapist do it. We, we do the focusing. You know, you're describing your mother's visit and it's coming and it sounds like it has a possibility of being a real disaster. And I'm just wondering is it that you're feeling trapped by her visit, are you feeling kind of claustrophobic that it's gonna be intrusive. And then I'm very happy when they say it's none of those. 

01:09:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:09:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Right. Cuz then I know they've really checked inside. 

01:09:05
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:09:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That sometimes I have to begin the process as the therapist of doing my own focusing to help them ease into, to finding their place inside. 

01:09:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, and as, uh, is there somewhere, in a moment we'll talk uh, spend a little time just uh, give, making people aware of some resources, some ones they can find more about focusing as, as we bring this, this uh, exploration to the, to it's conclusion. Uh, you have some final thoughts or applications that you think you really like to pass along when you're explaining. 

01:09:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Yes. 

01:09:45
RICH SIMON Methods to people. 

01:09:45
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well, I think the last thing I'd like to say is that I think therapist can use focusing to help nurture and notice the positive that comes into therapies. I think one of the big mistakes therapist make is to focus too exclusively on what's negative and whatever we pay attention to grows. Now of course, I'm not suggesting people exclude what people come to therapy for. But I have found that the positive is always present even in the midst of very challenging situations. And we can lift it out if we notice it. And focusing is a wonderful way to lift it out. So, when people come in and there's some new energy they come in with or some, I sense some new excitement or maybe some movement or new accomplishment or um, just a better mood or they say I was just listening to MPR and it was so interesting on the way over. 

01:10:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:10:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN You know, I'll, whatever it is I'll want to kind of slow down and see if we can mine the positive with focusing because so often there's significance and meaning to the positive that can be very enriching to people. And we know from the neuropsychologist that uh, staying with something positive for 30 seconds allows us to savor it and to bring it into long term memory. 

01:11:05
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

01:11:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And to have it as a rich resource for us. 

01:11:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:11:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So I'm always looking for that, and so I'll just give you a quick example and then we'll wind it up for today. But uh, there was a fellow who came into my office and who said, kind of like a throwaway line. "So my son is moving to Medford, you know, the next town over from where I live. And that's good news." So I said, Oh well can we stay with that for a moment and just see what's so good about that news. 

01:11:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. 

01:11:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And um, and then I said, so just inside and notice what does it feel like in your body that your son is moving close to you, your grown son. And he said, "Well, I can feel some warmth around my heart." He said, "Yeah." After the divorce I wasn't sure I was really a good dad to him. But uh, the fact that he's moving here and wants me to be close to him is. 

01:12:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:12:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Kind of makes me think maybe I wasn't so bad after all. 

01:12:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:12:05
JOAN KLAGSBRUN And then said with a tear, he said it kind of lifts a big weight from my shoulder, right. 

01:12:10
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

01:12:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN So by just noticing this little positive I could have just gone, you know, he said it as a throw away statement. We could have gone on to the problems that he brought in we ended up coming to something very rich and important for him, for him to have articulated. 

01:12:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:12:25
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That he, some part of him knew but he hadn't yet said it fully to himself. 

01:12:30
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. Well, it seems, I mean that, that was my experience repeatedly through uh, uh, these various uh, processes we went through today, this, this way you have inviting uh, and helping people to discover these little, even in the, the midst of what may seem stress or difficulty to, to then with the, once the focus happens that there's something kind of natural unfolding of the positive emerges. 

01:13:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN That's right. There is always a sense of next step if we ask what does this need and there is. 

01:13:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:13:10
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Life forward direction I think in every, even in painful and shameful situations. If we're with it in a friendly way and, and really go to that level in which we know more than we think we do. 

01:13:20
RICH SIMON Well great, a great note on which to end this part of our conversation. Since, so tell us um, if people are interested in finding out more about focusing, training opportunities, things to read where do they go? 

01:13:35
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Well, the, the website www.focusing.org is a really wonderful rich repository of hundreds of articles you can download for free on focusing and every topic. Focusing in philosophy, focusing and meditation, focusing and working with children, working with different populations, focusing in spirituality. So it's, it's just a great resource and. 

01:14:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:14:00
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, so I recommend that. Um, there are many trainings for focusing oriented therapist around the world. Um, including in Boston and New York has a wonderful uh, training that's connected with, it's called Focusing uh, Oriented Relational Psychotherapy, and it's a combination of relational psychoanalysis and focusing. 

01:14:20

JOAN KLAGSBRUN Um, uh, so people can find trainings uh, on that website. Um, there's a summer school, I'll be one of the five teachers at the summer school this summer in August in New York state. And that's a fabulous experience. 

01:14:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:14:40
JOAN KLAGSBRUN Of immersing yourself in a focusing environment for a week uh, where you study a major topic in the morning and learn from all the different teachers in the afternoon. So. 

01:14:50

01:15:05
RICH SIMON All right, that's uh, that certainly will get people started. And it uh, and speaking of getting things started we have for today uh, Joan has really not only given us these concepts but given us such a rich experience of focusing, and these various processes that she's demonstrated with us. So there's a comment board if you are so moved and I hope you are, please uh, take a moment now, take whatever implicit sense this, this experience has left you with or senses or whatever it is that's consciousness now share that with the rest of us through the comment board. Insights, discoveries, connecting the dot type experiences, questions Joan will uh, will be looking at the comment board if she is so moved. She may very well respond with the important things.
