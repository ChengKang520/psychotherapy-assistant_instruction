Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:00
DR. WINNIE KING We have heard so much about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in the last 10 years, that many parents wonder whether their unmanageable kids, have ADHD, as it’s also called or if their kids are just unruly. Today we are going to take an in-depth look at what ADHD is? What it isn't? And what treatments are available, and we begin by meeting a family that lives with ADHD everyday. 

00:01:25
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN My name is Jane Elizabeth Bunn. I am 8-years-old, and my brother has ADD and his name is Andrew. Sometimes he behaves a little bit too wild. 

00:01:35
ANDREW BUNN Elizabeth, okay get yourself off the table, now get it off the floor. 

00:01:45
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN Alright. 

00:01:45
ANDREW BUNN Like sometimes, I just totally flip out on her if she does something really little. And don't keep putting it on the table. 

00:01:50
MICHELE BUNN Andrew was diagnosed with ADHD, I think he was age 6 and teachers recognized the symptoms and suggested that we have to test there are characteristics of ADHD, Andrew exhibits 99% of those, the inability to concentrate, to focus, if he is in a classroom, he will hear someone tapping their foot or tapping a pencil in the back of the room and that would totally drop his concentration. 

00:02:20
ANDREW BUNN I was not good at organization. I usually I always do the work and then I wind-up losing it. I don't know why it is. 

00:02:25
MICHELE BUNN He can't really pick up on the cues, any social cues that people might be giving to him. He finds it difficult to know when to be quiet, when to stop talking, when to say the appropriate thing or when he is something that he is saying is inappropriate. 

00:02:50
ANDREW BUNN I can acknowledge, when I'm being (inaudible ) and then I will stop, but usually I… I just don't know how to handle little at the time. 

00:03:00
MICHELE BUNN And it’s very difficult for him to really establish friends and to kind of be one of the guys, even though he has a desperate need for those social connections, it’s very difficult for him. 

00:03:15
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN Some people they forget that he has ADHD and sometimes just can’t help it. 

00:03:20
MICHELE BUNN You know he was just a fantastic athlete. When Andrew was playing baseball, he wanted to be a pitcher, he had a good eye, he did a fantastic job and the team would win. We gave Andrew a guitar for Christmas, he taught himself how to play, he is very-very artistic, when he was 6, he produced a series of paintings that it's like Picasso, and I am still amazed to this day, how lovely they are, just for their expression in the form and the colors and the texture of his paintings. The hardest part being a parent of a child with ADHD is now you feel that you have a little bit of control and you can kind of help them through things, but in the future, I'm not gonna be able to do that, I can't go with him to high school, I can't go with him to college, so, and it’s time to get him ready, and that's the hardest part. 

00:04:35
DR. WINNIE KING And with us now our Michele Bunn, Jane-Elizabeth and of course, Andrew whom we just met, and we are also joined by Dr. Stanley Turecki, and now he is a renowned Child Psychiatrist here in New York City and an author of several books including the “Difficult Child” and he is also widely regarded as an expert in dealing with ADHD and we also have Dr. Bruce Roseman whose son Joshua has ADHD, and who wrote a book about it called ”A Kid Just Like Me.” Now, he was instrumental in building a school for kids who have ADHD and other learning disabilities and Dr. Roseman himself is being diagnosed with ADHD, and welcome all of you to the show. I'm so glad that you are here. Andrew, thank you so much for letting us come to your house and see how special you are, and how wonderful and energetic you are. It must be hard sometimes to really make good friends? 

00:05:25
ANDREW BUNN Teenager with ADHD Yeah. Well we actually moved here couple of years ago, from Atlanta, and I… I feel they just knew me a lot better and could get used, very used to my ADHD back there and it's going to take them a while to get used to right up here. 

00:05:35
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. Its hard making those connections, you know Michelle, you would have saw a few glimpses of how this impacts the family, it's tough is it? 

00:05:40
MICHELE BUNN Mother of Teenager with ADHD It is, It's… It’s very tough, and it's the most consuming thing that I do all day, I mean I have a full-time job, two kids, a house, a dog, you know, the whole thing, and it really is the most all consuming thing that I do all day. 

00:06:00
DR. WINNIE KING Sometimes it's hard separating the kid from the behavior. 

00:06:00
MICHELE BUNN Absolutely. One of the things, that I try and remember and… and really use as a touchstone are things like Andrew’s paintings, because he is so gifted, and his music, and to use those to separate the behavior from the person. 

00:06:20
DR. WINNIE KING And I know you have some concerns about this cutie pie sitting right next to you, because it does have an impact, it’s not just about the childhood ADHD, other children in the family are also impacted. 

00:06:30
MICHELE BUNN Well there are lot of behaviors that Andrew can get away with that Jane-Elizaeth cannot get away with. 

00:06:35
DR. WINNIE KING And I know that you know that, don't you Miss. Jane, and it’s not so much fun, is it? Sometimes just feels like it's a little bit unfair, doesn't it? 

00:06:40
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN Sister of Teenager with ADHD Yeah, because like when he says bad words, when he gets in trouble, he usually gets away with it, but when I'm that you know, in trouble and I wanna say those bad words, and I say them, and my mom says don't say that, but then I bring up, well, you got him say that. 

00:07:05
DR. WINNIE KING That's right, that's a hard question to answer too. I know. Now how do your friends react to Andrew? 

00:07:10
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN Well, when he does something, well, they feel uncomfortable about, they say your brother is so weird and I am like well he can’t really help it. 

00:07:25
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, I know, he can't really help it, it is great that you stick up for him. Now Dr.Turecki, we know that you know up to as many as 10% of school aged children while actually have this diagnosis of ADHD, but let's go through the characteristics of ADHD and how do you make the diagnosis? 

00:07:40
STANLEY TURECKI , MD Psychiatrist Well, it's a grouping of problem behaviors that fall into three categories, difficulty concentrating, attending, focusing, hyperactivity being very overactive on the go with the time, restless, fidgety, and post self control, impulsiveness, courting out, talking out of turn, acting before thinking, those are the three broad categories. They have to be present from before the age of six, in fact many mothers would tell you, that even as a fetus in uterus the child was extremely, extremely active, kicked and moved around a lot. 

00:08:15
DR. WINNIE KING Really! 

00:08:15
STANLEY TURECKI Yes. Yes. 

00:08:15
DR. WINNIE KING Wow! 

00:08:20
STANLEY TURECKI Difficult baby to change on the changing table, so in other words, if it appears for the first time, after the age of six, then it’s not ADHD, and the most important feature of it, is that it significantly interferes with functioning and relationships, that's probably the most important thing, that really gets in the way. 

00:08:40
DR. WINNIE KING Now, we are going to talk a bit about treatment because I know all of our patients are watching and know about that, but let's talk about what ADHD is not, because it’s often mislabeled or other problems are thought to be ADHD. 

00:08:50
STANLEY TURECKI Well, I tell you a funny story about what it's not. I asked a child of about nine with ADD what he thought it meant. What and he said it's Attention Deficit Disorder, and I said what does that mean? and he says it means that I don't get enough attention from my parents. So, you see, it’s not that, it's not the kid don't get enough attention, it's not underperformance, the reason why it's diagnosed too much, in my opinion, I think it should be more like 3% then 10% is because they are average children, who don't perform well in highly pressured environments, and they often are prescribe medication, and diagnosed with ADD where in fact they are not, they just not performing up to power in a highly pressured environment. Sometimes anxious children exhibit fidgetiness and some of the other features but that's different, that's an anxiety problem. 

00:09:45
DR. WINNIE KING Okay, so, there is a big distinction, where you, a part of an issue, that's a really hot topic, and that's the issue of medication for these children, parents are very frightened at the idea of altering the brain chemistry with drugs, where do you stand on that? Is there an alternative for these medications? 

00:09:55
STANLEY TURECKI There is, ah… I… I think you have to be careful, you have to be selective, you have to try other things, for example, behavioral management, often these children have problems in other areas such as, I think the lady mentioned a certain lack of social sub-welfare, a group, a latency group, group therapy can be very helpful for that. So medication is only one of the forms of treatment, when its used the basic function of medication is to focus attention, and secondary to that, often the problem behavior diminishes as well. Those are the pro's. The medications that are the primary stimulants like Ritalin and Dexedrine had been around for 15-16 years, so we know them very-very well. 

00:10:45
DR. WINNIE KING Well now, Bruce you wrote a book about this, you have this, and you’ve also helped build a school for children like your son and like Andrew, but the real issue for you is advocacy, isn't it? 

00:10:55
BRUCE ROSEMAN Yes. 

00:10:55
DR. WINNIE KING Tell us about that. 

00:10:55
BRUCE ROSEMAN , MD Father of Teenager with ADHD Well, I think, the most important things that you need to advocate for is, testing and resources services. That's what, that's what people need. Under the Federal Disabilities Act people are entitled to a lot of services such as, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, extra resources in school, to be put in a small classes, and a sort of a group approach that needs to be taken and needs to be with the family doctor or pediatrician, the school social worker, the counselor, the teacher, and I think, that's what you need to advocate for, so that you can get services. 

00:11:30
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, did you find that, that was helpful with you, you know just having the whole team approach to taking care of Andrew? 

00:11:40
MICHELE BUNN Well, I wish we’d had a team approach to taking care of Andrew, but it’s really been a struggle with the middle school, and it took months to get an IEP in place, and I had to bring his therapist with me. 

00:11:55
DR. WINNIE KING Now when you say IEP, what do you mean by that? 

00:11:55
MICHELE BUNN An Individualized Education Program, or a 504 program. And it was difficult. 

00:12:00
DR. WINNIE KING It's hard, and how do you feel, about all this? I mean do you feel like, I know he has been on medications. 

00:12:05
MICHELE BUNN Yeah correct. 

00:12:10
DR. WINNIE KING Does medicine help you? 

00:12:10
ANDREW BUNN Ah… usually. 

00:12:10
DR. WINNIE KING It usually does? 

00:12:10
ANDREW BUNN Most of the time. 

00:12:15
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah. And how do you feel these days? 

00:12:15
ANDREW BUNN A lot better than I used to. 

00:12:15
DR. WINNIE KING Really, in what way? 

00:12:20
ANDREW BUNN It's just a lot different appearance, I actually, I just like being in a new place, kind of… I am kind of… kind of getting used to it now. 

00:12:25
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah and you feel calmer, like you are able to… to really… to really do the things that you are supposed to do? How do you think he is doing? Do you think he is doing good Jane-Elizabeth? 

00:12:35
JANE-ELIZABETH BUNN Well, he is doing pretty good. 

00:12:40
DR. WINNIE KING Yeah, pretty good. While coming from sister that means an enough a lot, so you should take that and be glad, because sisters are these are the ones they criticize the most.
