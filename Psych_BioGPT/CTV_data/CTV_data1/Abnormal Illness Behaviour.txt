  Good afternoon. Mrs. Brown to see Mr. Hobbes, registrar. 

00:01:15
 Yes, he's expecting you. Just one second.

00:01:45
MR. HOBBES  Good morning, Mrs. Brown. Please have a seat. How have you been since your operation? 

00:01:55
MRS. BROWN  Well, I'm no better. In fact, since the operation, I've been much worse. The pain goes round into my stomach and to my back, down both legs and up into my neck. It's excruciating. I've never experienced such pain. 

00:02:15
MR. HOBBES I see. 

00:02:15
MRS. BROWN You said I'd be better after the operation. You said I had adhesions and I would be better. 

00:02:20
MR. HOBBES Well it's not your fault, Mrs. Brown. I don't remember guaranteeing that you would be better. 

00:02:25
MRS. BROWN You did. You said I had adhesions. Mr. Hobbes said I had a pouch of bowel under my ribs and that was what was causing the pain. 

00:02:35
MR. HOBBES I think you may have misunderstood. 

00:02:35
MRS. BROWN Oh no! He definitely said that, definitely! You're the junior doctor, aren't you? You did the operation, didn't you? I'm no better, you know? The pain is terrible! 

00:02:50
MR. HOBBES Well, it could be more radiations. 

00:02:50
MRS. BROWN  Mr. Thompson did say I might get more. But you've got to do something for me. 

00:03:00
MR. HOBBES Well suppose, I suppose I could list you for further investigations. 

00:03:05
MRS. BROWN Well, if, if you think that would help, if you really think that would help, I'll do whatever you say, doctor. 

00:03:15
MR. HOBBES Right. 

00:03:15
SIDNEY BENJAMINE  We have just been watching a patient arriving for a hospital consultation, who exhibit some of the characteristics of Abnormal Illness Behavior. First, let's consider exactly what this means. In 1961, the American Medical Sociologist, David McHenig(ph), defined Illness Behavior. As the ways that people perceive symptoms, evaluate their significance and act, or fail to act on them. More recently, the term Abnormal Illness Behavior has been defined as maladaptive ways of perceiving, evaluating and acting on symptoms. People showing maladaptive patterns of illness behavior are not seeking recovery from illness but rather the maintenance of invalidism for some sort of gain. Sometimes, this is a conscious process as with malingering, but often it's unconscious. In other words, the patient doesn't know that he is gaining or what he's gaining from invalidism. These inappropriate behaviors can occur in many settings but particularly in the presence of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals. Because we are in an ideal position to endorse invalidism and so make it worse. The purpose of this tape is to help you to recognize some of the mechanisms that are commonly used by patients with Abnormal Illness Behavior so that you can learn to stop reinforcing them and start to reverse the process by encouraging more appropriate coping responses. We are not going to try to cover all the ways in which Abnormal Illness Behavior can present nor the causes or other aspects of treatment. So how can Abnormal Illness Behavior be recognized? As least one of the following features should be present. First, there are persistent complaints of one or more symptoms suggestive of physical illness, of which pain is by far the commonest, or of mental illness, such as poor memory or loss of confidence. Second, the patient regards himself as ill, and third, the patient appears disabled. 

00:05:50
4. 

00:05:50
SIDNEY BENJAMINE  In addition, there is either no objective evidence of physical pathology or mental disorder, or if there is, then it's insufficient to account for the severity of the patient's complaints, self-assessment of invalidism or disability. So patients with Abnormal Illness Behavior may possibly show evidence of a physical or mental illness requiring treatment in the usual way but their complaints or disability seemed to be totally out of proportion and this aspect of their disorder also requires appropriate management. Now, let's have a look at some typical problems. 

00:06:40
MRS. SMITH: 10 years agoraphobic symptoms Somatic complaints - no traceable cause Treatment - graded de sensitization programme 

00:06:40
  For the last 10 years, Mrs. Smith has suffered from agoraphobic symptoms which so far have proved resistant to variety of different treatments. She tends to have somatic complaints for which no underlying physical cause has been found. Here she is discussing with her why she's failed to complete a stage in a graded desensitization program. Note the various ways she tries to get the doctor to agree with her that she's unable to do the program. 

00:07:10
 All right, Mrs. Smith. I gather you didn't do your program, your activity program today. 

00:07:15
MRS. SMITH Oh, well you see Doctor, I don't know why but my leg has started giving way. It, it just goes and it's been doing it on and off for the last couple of weeks. Perhaps, you could have a look at it. I mean, I went to my , Dr. Graves, such a lovely man, so kind and he told me I had shallow acetabulums, you know doctor, shallow hips. Well, one minute, I'm going along and the next, my leg gives way. And well, this morning it just went, just before I was going to do my program, it just went and there's nothing I can do. 

00:07:55
 So Mrs. Smith, you haven't complied with your program for today then. 

00:08:00
MRS. SMITH Oh well, I'm really keen. Now you know doctor, how much I want to get better and how hard I'm trying, but it's my acetabulums. If my leg keeps giving way like this, I don't know what I can do. What do you think, Doctor? Surely, there's something you can suggest. It's just the program I can't do. You must be able to help. I know you're a specialist. I know you'll understand. You're always so helpful. 

00:08:35
 Oh that's very kind of you to say so, Mrs. Smith. 

00:08:35
MRS. SMITH  I feel I can talk to you, not like that nurse who's with me this morning. I don't want to complain, Doctor, but she wasn't very sympathetic. I can tell you. She made me feel as if I was doing it on purpose or something. I know you understand. Just talking to you makes me feel better. 

00:09:00
 Did you follow what was happening in those interactions that were taking place, sir? 

00:09:05
Uhm yes. I think she was trying to get the doctor to say that she didn't have to do the treatment program. 

00:09:10
 That's right. She's trying to leave responsibility to the doctor but. 

00:09:15
 Uh hmm, she was saying, "I can't, I can't do this. It's your responsibility to find another way of, of, of helping me despite the desensitization program being the treatment of choice." 

00:09:25
 That's right. She has various ways of trying to get the doctor to agree with her. 

00:09:30
 Uh hmm, uhm, she wasn't saying that she didn't want to do the program. In fact, she was saying she very much wanted to do it, uhm, but was unable to do so because of the pain in her hip. 

00:09:35
  That's right. She is feigning compliance there. She appeared quite cooperative at first, ah, but she was giving different reasons why she couldn't carry out her treatment and she also forces confrontation with the doctor there. She wanted to appear to be a good patient but she also wanted to put responsibility onto the staff to get her better. 

00:10:00
 Uh hmm, So she, she was saying that she, she didn't know what to do, that the doctor was the expert, and that, ah, it was, she should help her. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
 Uh hm. 

00:10:05
  And to find, you know, another way, and, without taking any responsibility of, of trying to think how she could help herself. 

00:10:15
 Yes. She appeared quite helpless, actually. Ah, she's putting the responsibility onto other people, ah, so that she could blame them if it didn't work out. 

00:10:20
  Uh hmm. 

00:10:25
 Uhm, did you notice any splitting that was going on? 

00:10:25
 Ah, no, not sort splitting in. 

00:10:30
 Right. Well, splitting is a way of dividing the staff. Uhm, the, the patient there is flattering the doctor but she's also portraying the nurse has been quite callous and withholding. If the doctor take sides with the patient, she's in danger of splitting the team. 

00:10:45
 Uh hmm, so she may have been saying similar things to the nurse about the doctor, uhm, maybe that both of them is to take responsibility for her care and, uhm, so it's quite complex interaction. 

00:11:00
Abnormal illness behaviors demonstrated were: DISPLAY OF COMPLIANCE HELPLESSNESS SPLITTING 

00:11:00
 To the compliance, helplessness, and splitting going on. 

00:11:00
 Splitting. That's right, yes. They don't always go together of course. 

00:11:05
 Uh hm, So, so what should the doctor do in this case? 

00:11:10
 What do you think? 

00:11:10
 Well, uhm, she'd certainly ignore the physical complaints and stress the importance of the program. 

00:11:15
The doctor should have - avoided reinforcing the physical symptoms - avoided a 'special relationship' with Mrs. Smith - drawn attention to her non-compliance with the programme 

00:11:15
 And, uhm, and her, her responsibilities... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
 Uh hm. 

00:11:20
 ...towards carrying the thing out. Uhm, she'd also avoid getting into any sorts of special relationship with, ah, Mrs. Smith. Uhm, interpret her, her not having carried out the program as, as, uhm, non-compliance. 

00:11:35
 Yes. 

00:11:35
The patient should have - a written contract which includes specific goals and commitments - a written daily programme and record Of activities 

00:11:35
 To reinforce a written contract, her goals of treatment, an d the commitments on the side of the patients and of also of staff as well. Uhm, to monitor her progress in her, in her programmed activities and how she's getting on. Yes. Right, if we could just have another look at another video which shows some other patients with Chronic Illness Behavior. 

00:12:00
  Doctor, you must see me, it's very important. 

00:12:05
 I'm busy at the moment. Can't it wait? 

00:12:10
 No, it can't. I need to see you now. 

00:12:10
 All right. Come into this room. Ah, I'll be in you for a few minutes. 

00:12:20
[sil.] 

00:12:20
  Well, what's the problem? 

00:12:25
 It's the pain, Doctor. Since I came in yesterday, it's got worse and worse. I just don't know what to do. I think it's all the activities you're making me do. Uhm, I just can't cope with it anymore. You need to give me some pain killers. 

00:12:40
 Well, the pain can't be that bad. It wasn't that bad yesterday when I admitted you. 

00:12:45
 Oh it's got worse. It's much worse than it was. That's to say, it's all these activities. 

00:12:45
  Let me think. 

00:12:50
 Look, I need some pain killers. I need them now. Just anything will do. Aspirin, Dispirin, paracetamol, anything. You must give me some. I need some, I need some now. 

00:13:00
 All right. I'll write you up for something. 

00:13:00
  And Doctor, the other thing is I was thinking that this pain is probably due to a tumor, so I'll need an x-ray. You need to send me for an x-ray as soon as possible. 

00:13:10
 I don't think an x-ray is indicated. 

00:13:10
  I think an x-ray is imperative. 

00:13:15
 I'm the doctor and I'm telling you an x-ray isn't necessary here. 

00:13:20
 Look Doctor, it's my pain not yours. You don't know what I'm suffering. You doctors are all the same. You just do your research, read your books, and people like me is suffering in, in pain and you're not bothered. You're not interested in helping. Well, I've had enough. I've been very reasonable up till now, I've done everything you've asked, and I've discussed all my problems with you. Well, it's just not good enough. I'm going to go and seek help elsewhere. 

00:13:45
 No, don't, don't be too hasty. After all, I didn't totally rule out an x-ray. Clearly, you're very upset and I'm sorry if I was a little harsh earlier on. I do sympathize with your problems and understand how hard things are for you. 

00:14:00
 What did you make for what was happening in that video? 

00:14:05
 Uhm, the, the patient seemed to run rings around the doctor and seemed to get everything she wanted. 

00:14:10
 Yes, the patient seemed quite demanding there. First of all, she, she demands to be seen by the doctor straight away. She secondly then goes on to demand analgesia from the doctor. He agrees to prescribe it, which isn't part of the agreed treatment plan. And it's not surprising that with this sort of positive reinforcement, she then goes on to demand and X-ray. 

00:14:30
 Uh hmm, When her demands for X-ray seemed to be unsuccessful, she, she seemed to change tack and becomes quite aggressive... (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
 Uh hm. 

00:14:40
 ...and threatens to leave the unit and accusing the of doctor not caring. 

00:14:40
  Yes. We call this hostile behavior. 

00:14:45
Abnormal illness behaviours demonstrated were INAPPROPRIATE DEMANDS HOSTILITY 

00:14:45
 It's an attempt by the patient to get the doctor to feel guilty about, and to get some sympathy and some care from the doctor. 

00:14:55
 Which are, which are all things which make... (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
 Uh hm. 

00:14:55
 Abnormal Illness Behavior even worse. 

00:15:00
 Yes, that's right. What should the doctor have done instead? 

00:15:00
  Well, I think he should've referred back to the contract which she'd agreed to and maybe, and ask her what she should have been doing at that time and... (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
 Yes. 

00:15:15
 ...look at some positive behaviors, maybe some achievement yesterday that he, he could positively reinforce. And, and remind her. 

00:15:20
The doctor should have - reminded her of her contract and of her own responsibility - rewarded her positive achievements 

00:15:20
 Continually of her responsibilities towards her, her treatment. Uhm, I think he should also say something about, stressing the importance of the, of the program and, and the contract, and maybe give her encouragement of how well she's, she's done up till now. 

00:15:40
 Yes. tha's, that's right. Should we just have another look at another video, which shows another sorts of behaviors. 

00:15:45
  All right. Thanks Mr. Graham for coming in. 

00:15:50
MR. GRAHAM Good morning, sister. 

00:15:50
  I just wanted to have a word with you about the progress that you're making with your daily program of activities. Uhm, I get the impression that you've not fulfilled everything that you agreed that you'd actually do. 

00:16:05
MR. GRAHAM I don't know what you mean. Nobody's asking me to do anything. Uhm, it's not a denial. I would've done things but nobody's asking me to do anything at all now. 

00:16:10
  I think you are aware of the activities because I think that you discussed them in some depth with Jane, the occupational therapist. 

00:16:20
MR. GRAHAM I don't remember anything about the program, what it is. In fact, I can't remember what me and Jane we're talking about this week. 

00:16:25
  Well, I think I have got a copy of your program here, Mr. Graham. Uhm, yes, there they are. I mean, it's in your handwriting. 

00:16:35
MR. GRAHAM  Oh that, yes. I didn't know I was supposed to do all these. I thought it was just up to me if I felt well enough. 

00:16:45
 Well, it does clearly state on the program that you agreed to do one hour's worth of activities each day, but you could choose what activities you wanted to actually do. 

00:16:55
MR. GRAHAM Yeah, I did sign to some covenant but, you know, I've seen staff and medical students, I've seen the doctors. I'm just out of time to do any of this. 

00:17:05
 Uh hm. Have you got a copy of this? 

00:17:05
MR. GRAHAM Ah, yes I keep a copy in my pocket. 

00:17:10
 So you could have arranged to see the medical students or the other members of staff at times that didn't clash with the things on your program? 

00:17:15
MR. GRAHAM  Well, I can't do the things that are down for today because I'm seeing the doctor this afternoon, and it's very important to see the doctor. 

00:17:25
 Uh hm. It's also very, very important that you do these things on your program and arrange to see the doctor at times that don't clash. 

00:17:30
MR. GRAHAM  So if I'll tell the doctor I'm cooking this afternoon, I'll see him another time? 

00:17:35
 That's right. It's very important that you do these things Mr. Graham. I know that you tried to do some gardening the other day, and that you tried hard and keep fit this morning. And that's extremely good. But it's very important that if you have appointments with people, you arrange those appointments at times that don't clash with the things on your program, and you have a time table so that you can actually do that. 

00:18:00
MR. GRAHAM Yeah. All right, I'll do that then. 

00:18:00
  Okay. I'll have a word with Jane, ah, tomorrow and just mention that we've discussed this and she can go through it with you again. 

00:18:10
MR. GRAHAM Okay. 

00:18:10
 Okay. 

00:18:10
MR. GRAHAM Thank you, sister. 

00:18:10
 Thanks for coming. 

00:18:10
  What did you think was happening there? 

00:18:15
 Well, in the beginning, Mr. Smith didn't seem to know what was expected of him and he, he seemed to have forgotten. 

00:18:20
  That's right. Did you think that was, that was so? 

00:18:25
 Uhm, but he may, he may have done. But, uhm, when it was pointed out to him that he'd actually written the program, it all seemed to come back to him. 

00:18:30
  Yes. He seemed to be using denial at first by pretending that he didn't know anything about his program. And it was only when the nurse confronted him that he actually accepted that he, he could remember what was expected of him. 

00:18:45
 Uh hmm. But he also seemed to, to make a lot of excuses. 

00:18:45
  Yes. He'd made various appointments to avoid doing OT activities. 

00:18:50
  Uh hmm. I mean, what, what can you do there when the, when the patient has appointments during the day? 

00:19:00
 Well, it was important to, to put the responsibility back on to the patient for fulfilling his treatment program, and it's important for the staff to remind him of his obligations there as well. 

00:19:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
Abnormal illness behaviours demonstrated were 

00:19:10
 So he seems to be using denial and avoidance there. 

00:19:10
  That's right. denial by pretending he didn't know anything about his activity program and avoidance by making various excuses. 

00:19:20
 Uh hm. So, so we've seen the methods used by patients to seek an appropriate care and dependence and some other ways to deal with that by encouraging more appropriate ways for seeking help. Uhm, but how does this help the doctor resort, resort in the opening clip, deal with Mrs. B in a busy outpatient's department? 

00:19:40
 Well, let's have a look at a few seconds of that encounter again. 

00:19:45
  Well, how've you been since your operation? 

00:19:55
MRS. BROWN Well, I'm no better. In fact, I'm worse since the operation. I've never experienced such pain. 

00:20:00
 I see. 

00:20:00
MRS. BROWN You said I'll be better after the operation. You said I had adhesions and I would be better. 

00:20:10
 Well, that's your fault Mrs. Brown. I don't remember guaranteeing that you would be better. 

00:20:15
MRS. BROWN You did. You said I had adhesions. Mr. Hobbes said I had pouch of bowel under my ribs and that was what was causing the pain. 

00:20:20
  I think you may have misunderstood. 

00:20:25
MRS. BROWN Oh no! He definitely said that, definitely. You're the junior doctor, aren't you? You did the operation, didn't you? I'm no better, you know? The pain's terrible! 

00:20:35
  Well, it could be more of radiations. 

00:20:40
MRS. BROWN (sigh) Mr. Thompson did say I might get more. But you've got to do something for me. 

00:20:50
 Well, suppose, I suppose I could list you for further investigations. 

00:20:55
 What was happening there? 

00:20:55
 Uhm, (cough) well, Mrs. Brown was being quite demanding and, and quite aggressive. She was saying that the doctor promised that he'd make her better. And he'd failed to live up to that. So therefore, it was his fault that she was, that she was no better. 

00:21:15
 Yes. It's unlikely though that the doctor promised that he'd make Mrs. Brown better, that the operation would be successful. Mrs. Brown's making the doctor be quite irritated with her. She's also goes on to question his competence at one stage. She's got the doctor to accept total responsibility for her, and in addition, to promise her further treatments and further investigations, which he doesn't believe is appropriate. 

00:21:35
  Uh hm. So, so what should he do? 

00:21:40
 I think it's important for him to recognize what was going on there, to keep cool and not, and not to be badgered by her. And it's a golden opportunity for him to remind her of the negative physical findings and to tell her as well that surgery was unlikely to be successful. 

00:21:55
 Uh hm. So she has, this stage, she has now underlying serious, physical problems? 

00:22:05
 That's right, yes. The next stage is for him to introduce to her the idea of professionals helping her. She lived with the pain rather than curing it. He may also want to refer her to a psychiatrist as well. 

00:22:15
 Uh hm. Is there anything else he can do? 

00:22:20
 Well, also, he can explain to her GP about not referring her to other physicians. 

00:22:25
The doctor should - avoid unnecessary investigations, treatments and consultations - explain the negative physical findings - introduce the idea of rehabilitation - consider psycho-social problems - negotiate psychiatric referral if needed 

00:22:25
 Which stops unnecessary treatment or further investigations. And once he's confirmed that she's got no physical serious disorder, he can then prepare the way to helping her to come to terms with her underlying psychosocial problems. 

00:22:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:45
  Good morning Mrs. Brown. Please have a seat. 

00:22:50
MRS. BROWN Thank you. 

00:22:50
  Well, how've you been since your operation? 

00:22:55
MRS. BROWN Well, I'm no better. In fact, I'm worse since the operation. The pain goes right around into my stomach, into my back, down both legs, and up into my neck. It's excruciating. I've never experienced such pain. 

00:23:10
 I see. 

00:23:10
MRS. BROWN You advised me to have the operation and I'm no better. 

00:23:15
 Well Mrs. Brown, what I quite clearly said to you, and I've, I've written down in my notes, was that it was doubtful whether another operation would help you, but you okayed to go ahead with it. The fact you're still in pain only confirms my belief that surgical intervention is not helpful in your condition. 

00:23:35
MRS. BROWN But you suggested I have the operation. You said I had adhesions. Mr. Hobbes said I had a pouch of bowel under my ribs that was causing the pain. 

00:23:45
 Let's be clear about this. You did have adhesions. 

00:23:50
Explanation 

00:23:50
 But they were dealt with, and there's nothing else wrong with you apart from that. I think it's very important to accept that surgical intervention has not helped you. It is very unlikely that another operation would be of help. 

00:24:00
MRS. BROWN  Perhaps I ought to see Mr. Hobbes again. 

00:24:05
 I've reviewed your notes in great detail and discussed your case. 

00:24:10
Avoid unnecessary procedures. 

00:24:10
 With Mr. Hobbes. It's also clear and important for you to accept that surgical treatment hasn't helped you and is unlikely to do so. 

00:24:20
MRS. BROWN But what are you going to do about the pain? I'm no better. 

00:24:25
 Well, Mrs. Brown, very often, it is not possible to cure pain. But it is possible to help you to find ways to cope with it. Well, that's gonna involve you learning to take a different approach. For example, you've already told me how you stopped doing the housework. 

00:24:45
Identify disability 

00:24:45
 Visiting friends, going for walks and so on. But the moving (inaudible ) the worst pain, any sort of pain becomes one of the main ways of helping you to cope with pain. 

00:24:55
Rehabilitation 

00:24:55
 Will be to encourage you to be more active. There're psychological specialists I can refer you to, to help you with this in more detail. 

00:25:05
MRS. BROWN You are saying it's all in my mind. 

00:25:05
  The, the pain. 

00:25:10
Acknowledge reality of pain 

00:25:10
 Is certainly real. But there are no signs of physical disease so it's important to take a different approach to treatment. 

00:25:15
SIDNEY BENJAMIN  We have now seen a number of mechanisms commonly exhibited by patients with abnormal illness behavior. These are compliance Helplessness, Splitting, Demanding behavior, Hostility, Denial, and Avoidance. We have looked at several ways of responding to these mechanisms in order to avoid reinforcing them, and this should lead to their extinction.
