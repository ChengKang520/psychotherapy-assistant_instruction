KEVIN NADAL , Ph.D Assistant Professor and Author of Filipino American Psychology Hi. My name is Dr. Kevin Nadal, I’m a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York. Today you’re going to be watching some videos that involve people with multiple identities. And we tend to watch a lot of these training videos and we tend to focus on one identity only. So for example you can see a video that talks about counseling Asian Americans or talks about counseling gay man or… or various other groups that may exist. Umm… and while those videos are great, I think it’s really important for us to really explore umm… what it would be like to have these multiple identities. Umm… how would you as a counselor or a clinician umm… work with a client and… and understanding these various identities and how do you as a counselor or a clinician help the client to understand how these identities sometimes conflict with each other and… and sometimes can even compliment each other. Umm… our first video is going to be with one who is… identifies as a gay man, he immigrated from Columbia when he was a young child and he’s gonna talk about some of the family pressures that he may experience as well as other societal pressures as well. Umm… as you watch the video, pay attention to how some of his identities, multiple identities, may come out in his presenting problem whether it’s his role as umm… a son, his role as a male, his role as a gay male, his role as an immigrate and… and understand how… how he sees the world and… and how a lot of these identities, actually all of these identities umm… impact his everyday life. So I hope you’ll enjoy the video.

Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Juan 

00:02:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL So Juan, what brings you in here today? 

00:02:15
JUAN AMAYA Hi. Umm… basically for the past two years, I felt this pressure to kind of put my life in track and just basically starts settling down and… 

00:02:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:25
JUAN AMAYA …umm… do the things that my other friends are doing such as getting married… 

00:02:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:30
JUAN AMAYA …starting to have kids ah… I mean experiencing that a lot. 

00:02:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:35
JUAN AMAYA Umm… I guess it’s (inaudible ) age 25 years old and it’ll be 26, so I guess it’s something common. And umm… sometimes I just put the spotlight and it makes you feel kind of so alone, you know because you don’t really realize whether or not umm… you’re gonna go down that path. 

00:02:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:02:50
JUAN AMAYA …as far as marriage or having kids, which something I do think about but I mean especially maybe you’re going to be a single parent or a gay or I'm not… I haven’t really researched that but being a gay, our relationship in trying to adopt… 

00:03:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:03:05
JUAN AMAYA …requires, I think a lot of more financial… 

00:03:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:03:05
JUAN AMAYA …resources than… 

00:03:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:10
JUAN AMAYA I guess the heterosexual couple. 

00:03:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… When you’re talking about these friends that are getting married, are you referring to mostly heterosexual couple? 

00:03:15
JUAN AMAYA Yes. All heterosexual and I don’t know majority of my friends are heterosexual couple. So every few… every few months I start getting like you know wedding invitations, so it’s someone you like of course you know very excited about this, but it’s like wow you know like it’s kind of falling behind… 

00:03:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:03:35
JUAN AMAYA …umm… at the start. 

00:03:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Great, yeah I mean there’s just something interested to think about is that there is perhaps this timeline that umm… we or society expects of each other and how a lot of it has really revolved around this heterosexual umm… relationship or… or model relationship. So how does this make you feel when… when you see all your friends getting married and following this timeline? 

00:03:55
JUAN AMAYA Well, I feel like I said the pressure part, I feel a lot of pressure and I also feel like umm… for my parents that’s… my friends are one thing then also my parents, I feel like I… I should be settling down, I should… I mean like I… they expect maybe like a child or you know the elders to have someone I mean like they know that I’m gay, it’s… but we don’t… we don’t talk about that. 

00:04:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:20
JUAN AMAYA Umm… but it’s… it’s almost… I almost sometimes feel kind of disappointment. Umm… and my immediate family they’re all here but the majority of my family is in… in Columbia. So every time I go visit, it’s that same question if they don’t know, you know they don't know that I’m gay, they ask of any girlfriends or you know when are you getting married or you know umm… all my cousins in my age are in the same boat, they… they’ve all been married, actually they’re all married. 

00:04:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right. 

00:04:45
JUAN AMAYA Umm… and they’re starting their families and so a lot of pressure and it’s just… 

00:04:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, lot of pressure. 

00:04:50
JUAN AMAYA And I don’t know it just kind of makes me feel lonely at times and… 

00:04:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:04:55
JUAN AMAYA Even though I’m physically lonely but it’s like… 

00:05:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. Yeah I mean it sounds like you’re… you’re getting pressure from… from allover, from different sides and… and so let me clarify your parents know that you’re a gay and that then they still pressure you to perhaps umm… you know still have somebody and follow this timeline and then… and back again in Columbia they don’t know that you’re a gay and they want you to follow this timeline. 

00:05:20
JUAN AMAYA Right. I mean and my parents, they (inaudible ) my parents right here. They don’t really pressure me. 

00:05:22
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:25
JUAN AMAYA I… I think I pressure myself, I put that pressure for myself. My family in Columbia I mean the majority of them I would say about 95% don’t know. 

00:05:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:05:30
JUAN AMAYA Umm… just because I don’t spend much time with them and I really grew up there. I’m very close to them. I see them… I try to see them once a year. But umm… since they don’t know, they… they just assume that you know I’m straight and they of course like that you see once a year they… they wanna know, oh, you’re getting married or… or where is your girlfriend or is she coming to you know to visit. 

00:05:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:05:55
JUAN AMAYA And actually I have a younger brother who is 23 or 22 years old actually and he is in the relationship five years with his… with his girlfriend and he just brought her back to Columbia last year for the first time and I mean that even kind of like stepped up the game for me you know… 

00:06:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure because your younger brother is… 

00:06:10
JUAN AMAYA Right. 

00:06:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL …following this timeline, yeah. 

00:06:15
JUAN AMAYA Umm… (inaudible ) I feel like solely responsible or that I should be doing in my age you know. 

00:06:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL So since this is our first session, I wanna get to know a little bit more about your family. Umm… you said that a lot of your family immigrated umm… or a lot of family are still at back home in Columbia and… and your parents immigrated here and you said you have a younger brother. Are there other people in your family? 

00:06:35
JUAN AMAYA Yes. Umm… my immediate family it’s my parents um… my sister and I have another sister who just came from Columbia as well and my brother. And I… my parents and (inaudible ) were born in Columbia. I was actually born there and umm… came here. My father came here probably 26, 27 years ago. And I guess the year after or 2 years after, mom and I came over to join them. And basically they just kind of left their entire lives just to start up again here and give me a better life. 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. And you said you’re the oldest child. 

00:07:10
JUAN AMAYA I’m. I’m the oldest. 

00:07:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL What’s that like being the oldest child?. 

00:07:15
JUAN AMAYA Ah… it’s… it’s… sometimes I feel and you know I feel bad because I feel like I've been you know robbed of my childhood. The things that umm… my friends and you know, the experiences that they had, I didn’t have them as well, just we’re I mean obviously immigrants. We came here pretty much with nothing in our pockets and my parents you know soon after they had my brother and I mean my parents worked essentially 20-hour a day, 7 days a week and I was basically left to care for my brother. 

00:07:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:45
JUAN AMAYA We're just fine, I wouldn’t have any other way but, I… I guess I have a like fatherly figure for… 

00:07:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:07:50
JUAN AMAYA …my brothers and my sisters and I’ve always been kind of… 

00:07:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:07:55
JUAN AMAYA …tough on them and been you now really responsive and protective of them and um… so you know it's… it’s great but sometimes I feel like ah… I wish you know, I wish I had just been a kid a little bit more you know, relax even more. 

00:08:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Well, umm… what’s your relationship like with your parents? 

00:08:10
JUAN AMAYA Ah… I wish we were close. I wish we were much closer but we’re not… I mean we have a good relationship. It’s… but as far as communication goes, we don’t… I don’t really confiding them things, it’s probably the gay thing I never… I never told them. 

00:08:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:25
JUAN AMAYA I’m… I’m out but I’ve never told them and part of it’s… because I never felt like I had… I need to tell anyone about it. I felt like it’s just who I am and secondly it’s just I felt very uncomfortable bringing it up. 

00:08:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL So how did they find out? 

00:08:40
JUAN AMAYA My parent… we had like (inaudible ) for a year um… and I was in a relationship at that time, my only relationship and my X, he was actually the one who basically pushed me to kind of reconcile my family… 

00:08:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:08:55
JUAN AMAYA …because we’re such… it was only five of us here. We’re really small, (inaudible ) He… you know should contact your mother, which I did and that was for Thanksgiving actually about three or four years ago and (inaudible ) bring anyone (inaudible ) why don’t you do that. And I did… I brought my X to join us and that was (inaudible ). 

00:09:21
DR. KEVIN NADAL No reaction, no talking aloud at least about it. 

00:09:25
JUAN AMAYA No, no, no, my mom I mean my mom and him remained friends. We had a good relation… 

00:09:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay, great. 

00:09:25
JUAN AMAYA Umm… 

00:09:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Did they… 

00:09:30
JUAN AMAYA I mean never… we’ve never discussed. 

00:09:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:09:30
JUAN AMAYA But it’s just you know they never asked me (inaudible ) nothing like that (inaudible ) how is John doing. That was his name you know it’s up to you know we lived here for two years so as far as that um… there is only one incidence (inaudible ) came to me and he said you know I don’t care if you’re a gay, I love you no matter what I mean… 

00:09:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:09:55
JUAN AMAYA That was (inaudible ) sometimes like that was four, five years ago. It sounds it’s kind of… 

00:10:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:10:00
JUAN AMAYA Just you know, (inaudible ) my parents, you know, ask me. 

00:10:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:10:05
JUAN AMAYA Are you seeing anyone or what's going on? It's… I guess I would just (inaudible ) for a little pressure that I feel, I feel like I don't know. 

00:10:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yes. I mean you talk about you know this not talking about things in your family and then I wonder if that doesn’t just apply to your… your being a gay but with other things and um… Can you tell me about how things are… are talked about in your family? And how problems are solved and decisions are made and that sort of things? 

00:10:35
JUAN AMAYA Sure, I mean I guess I would say things are really talked about. I mean they kind of… just kind of really (inaudible [00:10:41) we don’t really… we don’t really address things. Umm… I don’t know that part of it has to do with the fact that parents are always working so hard that you don’t really have that you know sit-down dinner and (inaudible and your interest issues because (inaudible ) There wasn’t the parent… they're working on just one and when the one came back here or the other, they’re too tired, it’s… you know you’re… you’re more interested as a parent to provide for your family. 

00:11:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:11:05
JUAN AMAYA Then and it’s more of the physical things and the emotional part of it. 

00:11:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:11:10
JUAN AMAYA Umm… things are much so for now, just because we’ve been (inaudible 25 years. So my younger sister has different experience and I can see it just when I come over, I see there are a lot more affectionate with the youngest one and so I think that I mean which is great… 

00:11:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah… 

00:11:30
JUAN AMAYA (inaudible ) that, but I mean I don’t really think that it’s just kind of something I… 

00:11:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Great. 

00:11:35
JUAN AMAYA I’m missing it and I didn't really have them. 

00:11:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yes. What’s that like saying that aloud? 

00:11:40
JUAN AMAYA It’s weird, it’s crazy. I… I… I feel guilty and I feel umm… kind of like ungrateful sometimes you know thinking these things that go through my mind. They will go through my mind a lot and I just think of them and it’s kind of… I… I run a lot, so when I run (inaudible ) process everything whenever I really say that out. 

00:12:01
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:12:05
JUAN AMAYA (inaudible ). 

00:12:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah tell me a little bit more about this guilt or feeling ungrateful. 

00:12:15
JUAN AMAYA I felt like umm… I shouldn’t be… I’ve had a great thing, overall pretty good life and I went to… I went to college and I’ve never really been hungry, I’ve had enough clothes, shelter and I mean I should be great with those things. 

00:12:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:12:30
JUAN AMAYA But umm… I mean when you’re here, when we’re not… obliviously we’re not from here. But you have your school kids that are of that plus, I guess the emotional parts that come with the family and like the sit-down dinners and like the family vacations and you know… 

00:12:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:12:45
JUAN AMAYA … like… like kind of the emotional things that I really wish I had growing up. Umm… as an… as an adult, I tried to… umm… I guess I’m very emotional as an adult, I guess part of it is because I (inaudible . 

00:13:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:13:00
JUAN AMAYA So I don’t know… 

00:13:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, I mean it's just interesting because you came in here and talking about umm… you know feeling left out from your friends or getting married and following this timeline and then now you’re talking about just comparing yourself to others umm… what the kids growing up had and… and what their families were like and what your little sister is getting and… and you know just… it just sounds like umm… it could be really isolating to… to have this experience that other people might not have or you perceive other people to… to have a different experience. 

00:13:30
JUAN AMAYA That word’s like isolation I feel, I mean that would be a word that pretty much sound like how I feel (inaudible )… 

00:13:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:40
JUAN AMAYA (inaudible ). 

00:13:41
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:13:45
JUAN AMAYA Financially umm… (inaudible ) I think… 

00:13:47
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:50
JUAN AMAYA I feel that way. 

00:13:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, you mentioned earlier that you have mostly or all heterosexual friends I think you said. 

00:13:55
JUAN AMAYA Right, I would say like 95%… 

00:13:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:13:55
JUAN AMAYA …friends I have are a very few in recent… 

00:14:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure, yeah. 

00:14:00
JUAN AMAYA (inaudible ) my friends, I call them as my family just because that like that I will show the part that I missed in my family and I get from my friends… 

00:14:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:10
JUAN AMAYA (inaudible ). 

00:14:12
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:14:15
JUAN AMAYA But I don’t know (inaudible ). 

00:14:16
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. Does it feel isolating with them too sometimes? 

00:14:20
JUAN AMAYA Sometimes ah… sometimes I feel like they can really with some parts of my life but the other parts, being a gay part of… 

00:14:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:14:30
JUAN AMAYA …the kind of thing that I’m missing like, you know having someone to just come home to and talk to and (inaudible ) watch TV and just you know that kind of physical, you know emotional relationship with a partner like that part I… I feel isolated because they can’t really… they can’t really, really… with that and everyone for a reason they are all in… 

00:14:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:14:50
JUAN AMAYA …kind of a relationship, so it’s like they can’t really understand… 

00:14:55
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:14:55
JUAN AMAYA …that all will be in one relationship and I feel like it’s a little bit harder for me. I don’t know it’s a just a gay thing or it’s me thing. So yes isolated. 

00:15:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL So you… you talked about feeling isolated and umm… feeling isolated maybe with your friends or in relationships and perhaps is it do I feel isolated because it’s a gay thing or is it a me thing. Umm… let’s talk about that a little bit more umm… How… how do you feel talking about you know that that your friends have these partners and… and you don’t right now at this point, at least at this point in your life?. 

00:15:35
JUAN AMAYA Um… I mean like I said before it’s… it’s… it’s a constant pressure that I feel and it’s also like you… like you’re looking for someone but you’re always kind of like an (inaudible ) I feel like I’m always gonna look like oh it’s just a potential person or… umm you kind of want that romantic like bump into someone and like in the supermarket and just kind of like hit it off and things go from there and it’s just like it’s beautiful kind of love story that I picture in my head that I want that I see others that have that and I really do want that you know. 

00:16:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:05
JUAN AMAYA Umm… and I just, I feel like oh I have to work so hard for it and I don’t… 

00:16:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:10
JUAN AMAYA …like I can’t really distinguish whether it is like… like… like being the gay is that or is that just the personality or is it me… 

00:16:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:16:20
JUAN AMAYA You know and umm… and it just… and it just makes you feel very lonely at times. And I mean like you can… you can be surrounded like many people in the world and like half of my friends and… and my family, so it’s not (inaudible ) lonely but… 

00:16:33
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:16:35
JUAN AMAYA …I feel that you know, I feel it at times and umm… I mean it comes and goes and you know you just kind of have to like deal with that at times and… 

00:16:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:16:40
JUAN AMAYA …kind of work through it so that you know you just don’t get deeper in this hole that you kind of create. 

00:16:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL So you got a chance to talk about this with other people? 

00:16:50
JUAN AMAYA No, no, not to… you know not this deep. On the surface level I do. I speak to people and like you know to my friends. But I also don’t feel like burdening people. I don’t feel like… a lot of times I feel like ah… you know I know they’re more than happy to listen to me and are willing to sit there and you know have conversations with me, but sometimes I just feel like I don’t wanna burden them, I just you know, like I’ll just kind of mention it , but I won’t go deep into conversation about this, so I don’t have the opportunity to do it. 

00:17:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:17:20
JUAN AMAYA Umm… and it’s… it’s like you know you… so you got a (inaudible ) pressure brought(ph) up and you know you just want to like kind of… 

00:17:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL You feel like it’s ready to explode. 

00:17:25
JUAN AMAYA Explode yeah and just kind of I’ll let go, it’s just tiring, you’re tired. 

00:17:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah, I mean one thing that I’m hearing is that umm… you know you… you experience these feeling of you know either feeling lonely or feeling isolated or ungrateful, but then you don’t allow yourself to feel them because you know you don’t wanna concentrate on you and you know you don‘t wanna compare yourself to others or… or other things about worrying about others and not about your own needs. And I mean what that’s like to… to have these things and then to… to dismiss them? You know not allow yourself to experience them. 

00:18:05
JUAN AMAYA Well that… that pretty you… you’re right and then I get… I guess I don’t really allow myself to experience these feelings. I… I kind of… when I started feeling ‘em, I kind of just (inaudible it’s just kind of like pushing away and umm… like that feeling ungrateful, feeling you know it gets me upset, sometimes I get angry like, ah I wish I has this and… 

00:18:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:20
JUAN AMAYA Umm… I had this I was gonna miss opportunity I wish you know done this as a child and you know but then I’m like… but you know my parents like gave up their entire lives. They just picked up and left so that I can be where I am now where I’m sitting, so I can go to college and you know so I can do all these things umm… that I was able to because of them… 

00:18:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:18:40
JUAN AMAYA …that to be alive because essentially part of the reason they left is also for safety reasons and you know I’m alive because of them and that’s just kind of… 

00:18:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:18:50
JUAN AMAYA …kind of pushes whatever other feelings I had, so I don’t, I mean I… this… this doesn’t progress. I mean I don’t think about further and I just… it’s there and it’s kind of like rest(ph) of the side. 

00:19:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right and then you feel guilty or ungrateful if you do experience these feelings. 

00:19:05
JUAN AMAYA Oh yeah absolutely. 

00:19:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:19:05
JUAN AMAYA I’m guilty, I mean all time for feeling those things and you know, I feel wrong you know I feel like… 

00:19:15
DR. KEVIN NADAL I mean it sounds like there… there is a lot of sacrifice in your family and… and because of that sacrifice it makes you even harder to connect to some of these emotions. 

00:19:20
JUAN AMAYA Yeah. 

00:19:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, tell me a little bit more about your family and your family dynamic. I know you talked about your parents umm… but how about such the entire family and just including your siblings and if you have extended family as well that you’re close with, you know what’s that like for you? 

00:19:35
JUAN AMAYA It’s… it’s… it’s really… I feel like that when… when my family came here from Columbia they lost a lot of their identity as you know people as family as the whole family dynamic thing. It’s just kind of you lost it because you came here umm… and for many years you know my parents had to… had to work on their documentation and all of that stuff, so they… they can’t really get up and go back and visit for you know for (inaudible ) 7 years… 

00:19:57
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:19:57
JUAN AMAYA …of their life, which was you know my entire childhood… 

00:20:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:20:05
JUAN AMAYA That 7 or 8 years old, I actually went to Columbia for the first time. Umm… because I came as a baby so I never… you know I never really… I used to talk to my family through the phone. When I got there, I was like 7 or 8 years old. It’s a completely different atmosphere. I mean there was lot of like, a lot of… a lot of hugging, a lot of kissing, a lot of… and like that kind of stuff I didn’t have at home you know. So being there was like this is so different, this is not what I’m used to. It’s… it’s very like… it’s very… it’s a huge family but they’re all very close and I love that and I wanted (inaudible ). 

00:20:36
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:36
JUAN AMAYA I miss this, I wish I never had it, but like I miss it you know. 

00:20:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:20:40
JUAN AMAYA And but now like we’re… we’re not very you know we… we… in my family we’re close and we love each other obliviously, there is just nothing, but we’re just different we’re not that affectionate family. 

00:20:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:50
JUAN AMAYA Umm always like my brother and I like to hold this for my parents. My younger sister like I said she has a different dynamic. They are affectionate with her, they’re more affectionate with her, but I think I mean that’s just my brother and I had different experience than she has you know umm… 

00:21:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL And I wonder if there is a gender component to that too. 

00:21:10
JUAN AMAYA Yeah, possibly as (inaudible ) yeah. 

00:21:11
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:21:11
JUAN AMAYA That would make sense as well, Umm… so I mean like I wish I had had more (inaudible ) communication with my family, but I feel like I don’t… (inaudible ) reach out like I don’t… like I’ve been calling mom and dad and feel like oh, (inaudible ) and you now you can’t meet someone and because I feel comfortable bring that up. When I feel like my brother, he does speak to my parents about his… 

00:21:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:21:35
JUAN AMAYA …relationship with his girlfriend and then he… and it’s… I guess it’s I don’t… I’ve never asked them per se about like I feel, it’s easier for him to do that. Umm… I don’t think that feels comfortable doing it. 

00:21:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right, right. And you know I know that earlier you mentioned this question of whether it’s a gay thing or me thing. I mean I wanted to explore that a little bit more. Umm… so you know when you did go to your family with your… your boyfriend at the time they just didn’t talk about that. Is that something that you think was specific to your experience or is that something that perhaps might be for anytime someone brings home umm… someone new? Do they talk about when heterosexual boyfriends or girlfriends come into the family? 

00:22:15
JUAN AMAYA I know we talked about when my brother brought his girlfriend for the first time, like the first thing is um… she was you know an Italian you know American Italian girl. So it’s like different like all you know umm… and we definitely talked about it you know… 

00:22:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:30
JUAN AMAYA My brother wasn’t there. We talked about the girl. (inaudible ) we loved and said oh she is really nice you know so we talked to him about it and you know like… 

00:22:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay so you included him talking about him. 

00:22:40
JUAN AMAYA Oh yeah, yeah when he came back you know like we like her you know she is great, she is really nice and stuff like that but with John it was a… you know my X he was gone, but that part of it was another thing like he was gone so my family… it was like a pleasure to my parents, I mean the length of language barrier, (inaudible ) to communicate with them and you know they… 

00:22:56
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:56
JUAN AMAYA …they really like (inaudible ) company and you know we spent a lot of time together, but it was never you know like oh we really like him or you know like I hope this works out you know like what you say like we hope you get married, you know we never talked about that you know. 

00:23:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:23:10
JUAN AMAYA It was like okay. (inaudible ) they love him but we never talked about it, it was… which I never did. 

00:23:16
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. How does it feel about recognizing that perhaps it might have been a little different when your brother brought his girlfriend home and when you brought home your boyfriend? 

00:23:25
JUAN AMAYA To be honest I guess because… because I feel slightly uncomfortable speaking to them about it too, I just… it sounds wish I could have… 

00:23:30
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:35
JUAN AMAYA But I felt like I’d be a little uncomfortable too, I just don’t know how to adjust it. 

00:23:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:23:35
JUAN AMAYA I don’t… as much as I see, there is nothing wrong for me. I’ve always thought that there is nothing wrong with me being who I’m, umm… because I’ve known for my entire life that I was a gay and I never know anything different. 

00:23:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:50
JUAN AMAYA Umm… now I'm talking about it is just like that other part of like I’ve never… as a child I saw that it was not really accepted. Umm… so I never talked about it and I guess that was just normal for me not to talk about it… 

00:24:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:24:00
JUAN AMAYA …it’s just you know… 

00:24:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:24:05
JUAN AMAYA It is what it is, you know. 

00:24:05
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. 

00:24:05
JUAN AMAYA Umm… yeah. 

00:24:10
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah you know in anytime you know I… I see clients and we talk about you know sexuality and… and people sexual identities, I mean I think it’s important to look at general roles. You know and how gender might play a part and how we view our relationships and so forth. And especially you said that you’re Colombian and so having these Latino values and wonder how you know some of these Latino gender roles might influence umm… you know even communicating with each other expressing feeling with each other and I know earlier we talked about your sister getting this you know this affection from your parents and maybe not towards you. So you know can you tell me a little bit more about umm… you know some of these values and how gender is umm… placed out in your family? 

00:24:50
JUAN AMAYA I guess it’s… not you say that if I like really back to my family in Columbia just and mom said there is a lot of males, it’s only two females and the rest of them are male. Yeah I mean, yes, you don’t really talk about feelings, it’s… it’s… I guess that’s a very (inaudible ) I don’t know it’s latino thing you don’t really umm… that’s like (inaudible ) that’s more order of thinking. You don’t really you know express your feelings to talk about being depressed or sad about this as a man especially. 

00:25:20
DR. KEVIN NADAL Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:20
JUAN AMAYA Umm… but now I feel like it’s… it’s changed with time. It’s… it’s more acceptable… 

00:25:25
DR. KEVIN NADAL More acceptable… 

00:25:25
JUAN AMAYA Umm… and I know that I mean, I know I create those lines of communication with my parents you know they’d be open like… 

00:25:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right 

00:25:35
JUAN AMAYA I just also wish that they would create a you know kind of reach out a little bit more. Umm… I’m(ph) too scared to do that… 

00:25:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah. 

00:25:45
JUAN AMAYA And it was just hope like feeling so like isolated I guess. 

00:25:45
DR. KEVIN NADAL Sure. 

00:25:50
JUAN AMAYA …umm… in that part of my life. 

00:25:50
DR. KEVIN NADAL So Juan we’re almost at a time and but I… first I wanted to… to acknowledge that it’s great that you came in here today and I think you mentioned today not only in your family and but just in general don’t really talk about your emotions and… and be able to come in here and recognize that it would be a positive thing to explore some of these emotions is… is really a strength for you too that you were able to recognize this. So I wanted to acknowledge that but it looks like there are a lot of different things that we can explore you know talking a little bit about this pressure that you feel from your friends and maybe some of these pressures in different ways you might feel from your family and maybe some other of these others unresolved feelings that you might have. Umm… and I think that this is something that we can umm… continue in therapy. How does that sound to you? 

00:26:35
JUAN AMAYA It will be great actually. 

00:26:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. Thank you so much. 

00:26:35
JUAN AMAYA Thank you. 

00:26:35
DR. KEVIN NADAL Okay. 

00:26:40
De-Briefing of Counseling Session Dr Kevin Nadal and Juan 

00:26:40
DR. KEVIN NADAL So Juan what was it like talking with me today in this… counseling session? 

00:26:45
JUAN AMAYA I feel there was a big weight kind of dropped from my shoulders. Umm… there was like a lot inside me that has to come out and I was able to start really seeing that you know just kind of exhaling. 

00:27:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:00
JUAN AMAYA …which is well I feel like… 

00:27:00
DR. KEVIN NADAL Right. I mean that sounds like you know you said earlier that you don’t get a chance to talk about some of these things, I… I really do think just trying you’re able to come here and share some of these things with me. Was there any type of technique or approach that you thought was helpful in our interaction together? 

00:27:15
JUAN AMAYA I guess… just a lot of the keywords that you used to describe my feelings kind of like hit it right on the nail so it helped me just kind of clarify a lot of what I’m feeling because I can associate with them one like the word isolation just (inaudible ) and I never thought of that and I’ve never you know but not only think about it just opens up even more for me to kind of explore you know, umm… in my mind it’s just like you know isolation that is exactly (inaudible ).
