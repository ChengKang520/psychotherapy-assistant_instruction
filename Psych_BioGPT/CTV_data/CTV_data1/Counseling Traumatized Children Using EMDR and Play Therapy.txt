Workshop 6

Steve Thaxton 

00:00:05
STEVE THAXTON So we have a lot to cover and before I thought we would get started I just wanted to check in by show of hands, please let me know who here is EMDR certified? Has anybody been certified? What is that? That’s a great question. We are gonna spend a lot of time on that because sometimes when people come certified I have to kind of divvy up the presentation and specialize it to people that already know a lot. So I’m just kind of gauging what you guys already know. So, the first part is what is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing? That is a great question. Oh! Before I forget, we’re being filmed, so for an educational DVD for the ACA and we’re gonna be participating in some activities, so I’ve been asked to warn you that if you have a warrant out for your arrest and you do not want to be on the DVD please let us know okay, alright. Okay, so let me get to my notes here. So Dr. Francine Shapiro is a brilliant psychologist and she invented Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing back in 1987. She was walking along a lake and she realized that as she was thinking about some disturbing thoughts that her eyes were moving in a particular pattern and she thought, “Hmm I want to know if there is something to this.” So based on her own experience she created Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, which is a terrible title because I have to say it over and over again but in a nutshell what it means is we now know how the brain processes traumatic information, we do it naturally. So, some of the pieces that we're gonna do today may seem a little odd but it really is our own brains' natural capacity to process information, for example, especially when we sleep at night, I don’t know if you’ve noticed a loved one or your children or a pet as the eye movements at night go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Well, that is based on the assumption that we are processing information constantly right? Because, for example, think back to the breakfast you had yesterday, can you remember that? Right, so it’s in there and you might take a minute and go back and it’s in there. So, we’re using that to our advantage because we can now help people file away traumatic information and stress, right? That’s the magic. I, just like yourselves, came to an EMDR training in Vancouver, British Columbia back in 1998 just to get some continuing Ed. I’d seen a demo that a professor I had done and I was really fascinated and little did I know that it would take over my whole perspective as a therapist and would influence everything I do pretty much especially even coming to Australia to talk to you about EMDR, so I started off just learning different pieces and then I realized how successful it was, so I incorporated it more and more and more and more to the point where that’s my main focus now just because the results are so incredible. Let’s see what else I wanted to tell you before I get started. So, that’s EMDR and I recommend that you go get trained. You can go for like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and get the first level of training and then you have supervision because you work with people and then you get your level two training and then there is post-level certifications after that, why? Because it is so amazing and so effective more so than just about anything else I’ve ever used. So, I thought first what we would do is do sort of a mock quick demo of what an EMDR session would look like with an adult and then what we’re going to do is I have small bundles of information, building blocks so to speak, to build on each other to get us to the practicum, which is at the end. I would love to just rush us to the end and have the fun part but I find that having this opportunity to kind of lay a ground work will then make the practicum understandable and as you leave here I’m hoping that you’ll have a really solid overall overview of EMDR. You can leave and go, Oh! I get it that’s my goal, right? And we will talk about clinical outcomes as well, so I hope you are excited enough to continue to pursue this track because nothing for me is more gratifying than seeing children become de-traumatized because you see they are little beings on a different level, which is so fantastic. So, just as a quick intro to EMDR so you can say -- you can see what is this. Would anybody be willing to volunteer with me for a second? Come on up, you are the lucky winner. So let’s see here, okay so have a seat. 

00:06:00
LEONI  Thank you. 

00:06:05
STEVE THAXTON Alright, so this is of course grossly simplified. Please do not quote this -- me on this because I’m just giving you a real, almost a cartoon version of how it works just so you can get a grasp, okay. So, as a therapist I’ve already done. What was your name? 

00:06:20
LEONI Leoni. 

00:06:20
STEVE THAXTON With Leoni I’ve already done an intake and an assessment right? So I have an understanding of what’s happening with Leoni and let’s say today that she has come to counseling because she -- let’s see she had seen a pedestrian get hit in downtown Melbourne and she -- it haunts her in her sleep and she can’t get it off her mind and she is also extremely scared to go downtown right? And she -- she -- we’ve talked about it but she needs some extra help. So, here is the quick fast-forward version of -- of what it might look like. So, I would ask her to picture the worst part of what she had seen, so she picks an image then I would say what negative belief do you hold about yourself based on that trauma? Then I would ask her where she feels it in her body and what feelings she has about that. So it might be -- I’m making this up, I’m terrified now, I have this really deep feeling of anxiety in my stomach, I can’t sleep and so I would say okay go with that. So, then what I would do is, this is the old school EMDR, which I would have her follow my eyes or else -- sorry my fingers, her eyes to my fingers and then I would do several repetitions and then I would step back and say what you get now? And over the session, which would probably last about ninety minutes the images, the feelings and the thoughts fade, which is brilliant, so then that’s it. So, then she would come back the next session, hello again and I would assess where we left off. Sometimes the trauma pops up a little bit higher and it's there just a little bit and we do it again but then it goes away, that’s the beauty of it and the trauma is done. So, in graduate school, the oldest method was to just talk through it which could take six months, a year and maybe get better, maybe not and so as soon as I started getting this pull with EMDR I was like “Oh! My gosh this is the most powerful tool I have.” Okay and just an example I mean I could tell you millions of stories but some of the most powerful ones were a police officer who had seen over the years lots of various horrific occurrences due to his job and as a male he had not talked about it to anybody because he was trying to be tough and by the time he got to me he was having extremely disturbed sleep, post-traumatic stress symptoms, was extremely upset and so I talked to him about it. I’m talking about EMDR and men really like EMDR too because it's something to do. I don’t have to sit and feel it, I don’t have to cry per se though you do get feelings and thoughts in the process, but anyway he really bought on and we went through and we cleared up all those incidences and he is a night and day person now for it. Let’s see. 

00:09:45
LEONI I have this experience myself. 

00:09:50
STEVE THAXTON Oh! You did? 

00:09:50
LEONI Yeah with EMDR. 

00:09:50
STEVE THAXTON Oh! Good and how -- 

00:09:50
LEONI Can you share that? 

00:09:50
STEVE THAXTON  Yes please. 

00:09:55
LEONI In 1991 I had a major car accident and I had a near-death experience in that episode and for two years I continued to seek out a range of different therapeutic interventions to try and resolve my need for healing. I was having a lot of intrusive thoughts, nightmares and continual meltdown. I was just getting worse and the therapies I was trying wasn’t working. I am a counselor, a family therapist and a registered counselor and it was EMDR in about 1993 that I had the opportunity to participate in and it was incredibly powerful and it was almost instant for me, the shift from where all was that. 

00:10:45
STEVE THAXTON Thank you. Thank you. Wow! What a surprise. Thank you very much. So, hang on one second. Let’s see turn this off here anyway. Alright, so just to keep you up to speed that is a great example of a single incident trauma and the challenge with children, many of the children that I work with and I’m assuming you work with is that a lot of traumas are multi-layered and not so clear cut, so what we're talking about today in this presentation is about stabilizing children who have multiple traumas, that’s it in the nutshell. So -- so that was a great example of how EMDR works just to reiterate really quickly, its our brains own natural filing system and we boot up the computer, our brain step back and let the person's own brain resolve the looping trauma into a neuro network that is not problematic right? Because due to the trauma it shifts it into a looping or a stuck point and we’ll look at that a little bit in a second, okay. So, just really quick to make more sense, once again another building block, in the '90s a clinician was working with blind people and due to not being able to see there was another advancement in EMDR and as I was preparing I was thinking the personal learning curve that I’ve gone through too where I learned and honed the skill set and it's evolving very quickly and I kind of get comfortable in certain arena and then there is more to learn, which I love and then there is more to learn and incorporate more and more and more and thank goodness I have a really great study group back in Idaho and so they go to conferences and come back and share what they know. So it’s a very exciting time. So, just let me show you how are we gonna use EMDR with children who have multiple issues, multiple traumas. One of the ways that we can do the bilateral stimulation instead of doing a eye movement because when a being receives a bilateral stimulus that’s when the left and the right hemispheres start to engage, okay? So if you can do eye movements like this and I also have -- there are several different ways that you can give somebody bilateral stimulation. With children a lot of times I’ll do hand taps, so if you could just put your hands out like this and tap like this, it's very similar. So instead of -- then I could talk to the person and engage with them like this, right? You can also -- there are different several methods, knee tapping, self tapping, butterfly tapping and it's kind of out of scope for what we’re going over today but I’ve also seen a therapist who works with infants and toddlers who have been involved in auto accidents. So, the parent sits on one side and holds the child and then the other person reads the storyline of the trauma and then they tap on the child and the child gets rigid and then relaxes and processes the trauma, okay. So, we're just doing some building blocks here to get you to the good stuff, so bear with me okay? Thank you very much. Okay. 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:50
Goal: 

00:14:50
to help clinicians apply E.M.D.R 

00:14:50
to challenging children 

00:14:50
from ages 5 to 15……… 

00:14:50
STEVE THAXTON So, today we’re gonna talk about helping children apply EMDR and this work comes to me from my own private practice experience. I do a lot of play therapy and I was frustrated because a lot of the trainings that I had gone to presented very clear-cut lovely case studies of very bright children who are very verbal, who had great parents, who would have one accident or one occurrence and clear-cut. Woo! And then I was taking that information and just leaning my head against the wall because I was like this little boy, this little girl, they don’t want to talk to me about getting molested and being in a foster care home. No way they are not going to sit down as an adult and talk to me, so if this work is a synthesis, the adult protocol, EMDR and play therapy. Can I just by nodding or show of hands, do you guys do play therapy with kids? Yes, yes, yes, yes great, okay so here is the meat and potatoes of what we’re gonna cover today. 

00:16:00
Address “Why Play Therapy?” 

00:16:00
Review Neurobiology of Abused Children 

00:16:00
How can children with multiple abuse histories use E.M.D.R? 

00:16:00
Stabilization is the key!!! 

00:16:00
Ego States; allowing the children to install the qualities they need 

00:16:00
Intake and assessments mindful of E.M.D.R., where is the trauma? 

00:16:00
Play Therapy Schemas: Children find themselves in various characters 

00:16:00
STEVE THAXTON Okay, so we're gonna talk about play therapy. We're gonna review the neurobiology of abused children because it's very preeminent. We’re going to talk about addressing children with multiple abuse histories, not just the easier ones. Stabilization is the key right? So when you leave here please remember this in your brains, stabilization, stabilization, stabilization, that’s what we are doing. We're gonna review ego states and we're gonna allow children to install the qualities that they need in a therapeutic session, okay? We're gonna do intakes and assessment review which I’m sure you already know, but we're gonna review it and look at where the trauma is and then we're gonna talk about play therapy schemas that children find themselves in various the characters, okay? So are you following me? Thank you. 

00:17:00
Provide practical therapeutic skills 

00:17:00
You can use to integrate E.M.D.R 

00:17:00
With challenging young clients! 

00:17:00
STEVE THAXTON Okay, so once again my goal is to be very practical. EMDR, I think, can sometimes seem sort of odd or sort of mystical. Well, I’m trying to break it down and be very practical with you, so you can see how this applies to you in your practice okay? So, this is a workshop and so rather than me just only standing here and talking to you I would like to have you learn by doing an experiential, okay? So and once again we have a camera rolling so if you like to opt out I want you to participate anyway, no, if you really don’t want to be filmed that’s fine, but I would like you to join us. So, we are gonna meet over in that back corner for just about five minutes, so come join me and let’s form a circle and we’ll go in a circle and wow! We have a lot of folks, that’s fantastic. Okay great, so let’s try to get fairly tight so we’re shoulder to shoulder, there is no spaces. Okay -- okay that sounds good. Okay we're gonna play a little game are you ready? Okay, here is how the game works. Alright so we're going to find one person that we are going to throw to, just that one person and once that one person has received the object, they have to immediately throw it to another person, does that make sense, sort of hot potato, but you cannot -- no one can have two turns, so when I throw it to you and then you throw it to your person that’s gonna be your contact person, does that make sense? So it's just one person, one okay ready? Okay ready? Okay so you are my contact person. 

00:19:05
 (inaudible ). 

00:19:10
STEVE THAXTON Throughout the whole game. 

00:19:10
 (inaudible ). 

00:19:13
STEVE THAXTON No one else and you don’t have to throw it across, you can -- this can be your person, that can be your person, are you ready? Go, there you go, Oops! That’s your person. Oh! That’s okay keep -- pick it up, keep going, keep going, keep going. 

00:19:30
 (inaudible ). 

00:19:35
STEVE THAXTON No, it can’t be the same person. Okay go. 

00:19:45
[sil.] 

00:20:00
STEVE THAXTON Well. Alright keep going, ready? Keep with your person. We're gonna up the ante, keep going, keep going, keep going. Oh! Oh! Grab your ball, grab your ball. Ready? Set, I'm doing more. Ready? Okay. 

00:20:20
[sil.] 

00:20:25
STEVE THAXTON Ready? Do your best, do your best, keep going, throw, throw. Keep going. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:21:05
STEVE THAXTON Oh! Heads up. Oh! Thank you. 

00:21:15
[sil.] 

00:21:30
STEVE THAXTON Oh! 

00:21:30
STEVE THAXTON Alright everybody hold your -- hold your toys please, hold your toys. Round of applause. Okay, so other than having a lot of fun what did you notice? 

00:21:50
 (inaudible ). 

00:21:51
STEVE THAXTON Well, what -- total confusion. We had a circuit going, keep your eye in the ball. 

00:21:55
 (inaudible ). 

00:22:00
STEVE THAXTON Don’t get hit. So what we are doing is we are playing right? We're shifting who we were before, we were sitting down and trying to be serious adults hopefully A, right. We are engaging with each other, we are forming relationships that are fun and enjoyable right and with children this is the point where we allow them to take the rings and explore what ever it is that they need to explore right? 

00:22:30
Why Play Therapy? 

00:22:30
STEVE THAXTON They just brought to my attention that there are EMDR audio tapes and there are several different ways to get children to do bilateral stimulation, right? And I’m glad she said that because I brought one of the main ones that I use which is a little buzzer here and it’s a TheraTapper, there you go. So these little pea pods are held in each hand and it offers an alternate pulse which engages the brain to start processing and filing away information, okay. So, I’m gonna pass, I’m just gonna leave it on, I’m gonna pass it around, feel free to play with it and pass around and then we’ll continue on okay? Can I pass this to you, a TheraTapper and there you go, okay. 

00:23:20
Play therapy allows for active/dynamic play that allows children to install neglected ego states due to abuse. 

00:23:20
E.M.D.R. “anchors” children who suffer from multiple abuses. 

00:23:20
Play therapy allows for specific target traumas to come forth. 

00:23:20
Play therapy facilitates a strong relationship with the therapist. 

00:23:20
STEVE THAXTON Okay. So play therapy like we discussed allows for active and dynamic play that allows children to install neglected ego states due to their abuse and we're gonna get into more detail in a few slides okay? So, one of the biggest pay-offs with EMDR is that it anchors children who suffer from multiple abuses and that’s that stabilization piece, okay? It allows specific targets to come forth and facilitates a strong relationship with the therapist and on that note as I was reviewing this material too, just a reminder that one time I was at an Adlerian conference and a big named speaker said, “Oh! If it's just all about tapping, I'm gonna throw in the towel.” And so, he was sort of sarcastic but his point was if it's just technique then he was gonna not do therapy anymore and the big point that I want to drive home is that EMDR is a tool, you still have to be a good therapist, you still have to have a relationship, you still have to know what you are doing. So, even though I’m focusing a lot on EMDR, there is a broader clinical picture for all of us okay? So, just some back story. I was bored with my office, I had a play therapy corner and areas in my office and I was bored, so I wanted to buy some new props so I have the standard you know a little kitchen area, I have a little baby doll, I have trucks, I have you know the whole gamut and I was in a toy store and little did I know what I was getting myself into, I purchased some Star Wars Lightsabers right? And I just bought them into the office and set them down amongst all the other stuff just because I was bored and little did I know that I was going to take over my play arena more than anything as ever done and I was really paid attention that the dynamic characters involved in Star Wars were what the children were needing in the play milieu and so I sat back and learned a lot. So, we're gonna kind of go in a Star Wars format here but the interesting piece is you can take these templates and put it over whatever storyline you would like. So, if you want to be Harry Potter, super heroes, Batman and Robin whatever fits your format and whatever the kid wants is fine, but we’re just using Star Wars so you don’t -- so that makes sense okay? Alright. 

00:26:10
Instead of private swords, 

00:26:10
I purchased “light sabers” 

00:26:10
Children who have extensive trauma 

00:26:10
histories need a softer way to 

00:26:10
approach their trauma histories. 

00:26:10
Playing through their schemas allows 

00:26:10
them to solidify their sense of self and 

00:26:10
their relationship to the world.... 

00:26:10
STEVE THAXTON  So, children who have extensive trauma histories need a softer way to approach the trauma history, right? Obviously we can’t go, “So, Susi tell me about when your mom and dad left you in the mountains for two days?” Right? It just doesn’t work, they just shut down. Playing through their schemas allows them to solidify their sense of self and their relationship to the world. 

00:26:35
E.M.D.R. 

00:26:35
allows children to be happy; 

00:26:35
They become able to verbalize 

00:26:35
their thoughts and feelings. 

00:26:35
Their behaviors improve. 

00:26:35
STEVE THAXTON EMDR allows children to be happy. They become more -- they will be able to verbalize their thoughts and feelings and their behaviors improve. So, this is all the work that we do, we laid on this really comfortable stabilized more happy child before we get to the trauma targeting, okay? Does that make sense? 

00:26:55
Specific trauma targets 

00:26:55
become approachable 

00:26:55
and treatable. 

00:26:55
STEVE THAXTON Specific trauma targets become approachable and treatable. So, let’s take a quick review of the neurobiology of trauma in children. 

00:27:05
Neurobiology 

00:27:05
of trauma in review: 

00:27:05
(Sr. Barbara Cline, FSE, PhD) 

00:27:05
STEVE THAXTON I’m going to -- I wish we had a little bit more time, so I’m gonna just skip a few slides, but it's really good information to have. 

00:27:15
Millions of children are victims of 

00:27:15
violence in world. 

00:27:15
Natural disasters, auto accidents, 

00:27:15
death of parents, sexual abuse, etc. 

00:27:15
STEVE THAXTON So as you know millions of children everywhere in the world are traumatized at varying degrees. It can be auto accidents, death of parents, sexual abuse, etcetera. 

00:27:30
During development, 

00:27:30
repetitive and patterned 

00:27:30
experiences result in 

00:27:30
corresponding neural 

00:27:30
system organization 

00:27:30
(mylenization) and dictates 

00:27:30
child’s level of functioning..... 

00:27:30
STEVE THAXTON During development the repetitive patterns, I picture it sort of like a tree branch, growing up, goes throughout the brain system and dictates their level of function, right? So, children who grow up in a really warm, loving, healthy environment get a lot of those tree branches because they get stimulated and then children that don’t, don’t. 

00:27:50
A child’s brain is malleable 

00:27:50
STEVE THAXTON So a brain's child is malleable and here we have the different stages. I’m just gonna summarize really quickly either use it or lose it. 

00:28:00
1. Neurogensis routines are born in infancy. 

00:28:00
2. Migration neuro networks move and settle into permanent places in the brain. 

00:28:00
3. Differentiation: Neurons specialize during development. 

00:28:00
Apoptosis: redundant and underutilized 

00:28:00
neurons die. “use it or lose it” 

00:28:00
Children who are abused have 

00:28:00
Stunted neuron development. 

00:28:00
STEVE THAXTON So, kids that are neglected and like as I just said abused, lose it. They just don’t have the same neuro level functioning as kids who grow up in healthy environments. This is me here; I’m doing a cartoon version of the neuro network system right? All the different various branches moving throughout the brain. 

00:28:25
Persistent stress responses causes 

00:28:25
a “threat response” which inhibits 

00:28:25
neuro development. 

00:28:25
Traumatized children have changes in 

00:28:25
emotions, behaviors and cognitive 

00:28:25
function. 

00:28:25
The extent depends upon the trauma, the nature of the 

00:28:25
event, duration of trauma and child’s constitution. 

00:28:25
STEVE THAXTON And let me see here, persistent stress response causes a threat response for children. Kids who’ve been traumatized have different emotions and behaviors and different level of functioning. So, we see these kind of children, we see hyper-aroused children that are -- everybody says they are ADD but its because they were under a stressful developmental world, dissociative, defeatist flat children, freezing kids that don’t move and developmentally delayed children, immature children. 

00:29:05
Response patterns in therapy: 

00:29:05
Hyper aroused children (not ADD/ADHD) 

00:29:05
Dissociative 

00:29:05
Defeatist “flat” depressed children 

00:29:05
(learned helplessness and lack of stimulation) 

00:29:05
“Freezing” behaviors when environments are 

00:29:05
threatening. 

00:29:05
Developmentally delayed “immature” 

00:29:05
Children with extensive trauma 

00:29:05
histories need stabilizing in therapy. 

00:29:05
Before E.M.D.R targets can be addressed, 

00:29:05
children need to feel comfortable. 

00:29:05
This is done through ego state work, 

00:29:05
E.M.D.R and play therapy. 

00:29:05
STEVE THAXTON Kids with trauma histories like that need to be stabilized first. So, we're gonna talk about how we can utilize the ego states that they explore in their play to our advantage and have a good time doing it. 

00:29:20
Exploration of ego states 

00:29:20
allows children to heal. 

00:29:20
Missing core personality aspects 

00:29:20
are found and installed. 

00:29:20
Adaptive Information Processing 

00:29:20
(API) is accessed (F. Shapiro) 

00:29:20
STEVE THAXTON Exploring the ego states allows them to heal. Missing core personality aspects are found and installed. There is a lot of verbiage here sorry, the Adaptive Information Processing or API, so this is Francine Shapiro’s theory. So, in addition to we know the neuro networks are not as formed. She posits that the neuro logical information is stored along those branch networks, right? And so say we have, according to this API theory, say we have a little girl who goes off on her bike and falls down and really badly and gets really scuffed up. Her parents aren’t there, she is by herself, she kind of pick herself up and come back home and she is in just a dirty mess and she is scared and she is alone. So, that history is stored for her along those neuro networks as a trauma spot, right? So, let’s flip that for a second and see how the trauma is adapted for the same little girl who falls down, scrapes her knee, her parents are here, they run out, they offer her a lot of love and consonance, give her a band aid, you know give her some kisses, put her back on her bike and guess what you know how that’s stored just as a memory right? So, then when you say, “Hey! Susi let’s go biking.” She doesn’t -- she you know it's in there but it doesn’t register as, “Oops! That was a trauma and I’m scared.” So, that is Francine Shapiro’s big theory, which is the cornerstone of EMDR, okay? 

00:31:00
“Adults with complex trauma histories often begin life with 

00:31:00
the really impossible lack of receiving severe, chronic, 

00:31:00
inexpiable trauma..... 

00:31:00
.....this often means giving into the developmental arrest at the 

00:31:00
time of trauma creating an internal labyrinth of “locked 

00:31:00
rooms” or ego states to hold and contain the path..... 

00:31:00
Our challenge is to understand the child’s situation and 

00:31:00
Unlock the doors to the house in order to strengthen 

00:31:00
resources, achieve developmental milestones, chronically 

00:31:00
trauma, learn their skills and redial tied up energy……”

Dr. Sandra Paulsen 

00:31:00
(Listening through therapists and ego states access the 

00:31:00
abused children) 

00:31:00
STEVE THAXTON I had the pleasure of going to a presentation by Dr. Sandra Paulsen of Seattle and she works with adults who are still maintaining ego states from when they were abused as children. So, I’m just gonna summarize this. So, she works with kids or adults that still have kid ego states that are have been around due to trauma and I’m sort of doing the opposite. I’m installing ego states that are positive with kids while they are still young. So, there is the nutshell does that make sense? Okay, thank you. 

00:31:45
Through the play therapy and EMDR 

00:31:45
I trust that children find and explore 

00:31:45
their hurt parts. 

00:31:45
EMDR installs these parts. 

00:31:45
Play therapy helps children access 

00:31:45
their adaptive information networks 

00:31:45
(API) 

00:31:45
STEVE THAXTON Through the play therapy and EMDR I trust that kids find and explore their hurt parts. EMDR installs these parts and helps them access their adaptive informational networks. 

00:31:55
Instead of allowing ego states to remain until 

00:31:55
adulthood, EMDR allows for healing while still a child. 

00:31:55
STEVE THAXTON Here I’m a visual person, so here is in a nutshell what we're working on. So, you can see there is a circle and there is that big gap where the kid has been hurt and we use the EMDR to install the missing piece that they need, right? That just helped me kind of see that visually. We use a lot of cognitions in EMDR and one of the real big selling points for me with EMDR is that we utilize cognitions like I said before, emotions and body awareness. So, you know there are some schools, theoretical schools now we have -- we know that we're the right path. No, it's cognitive behavior or no it’s a motive, well EMDR puts that all together. But these are the tools that we’re using right now with these children. So, kids, themes – cognitive themes with children on the hurt and trauma side are I am a victim, I’m powerless, I’m a bad kid, I’m abandoned. I have to be perfect. And then what they -- what I see in the therapy on the other side is I’m a survivor, I’m powerful, I’m good, I’m protected, I’m loved, and I can just be a kid. Right? That’s what they are working towards. I don’t have time here. So, bring on the play. How do we get started? This is just the basic. You still, like I said, need to do a comprehensive diagnostic intake, I meet with the parents or the caregiver first. So I have an idea of what they are working on, right? So, sometimes the caregivers can tell me what the trauma history is and sometimes they don’t know either. 

00:33:40
The Intake Conceptualizations for play 

00:33:40
are outlined: 

00:33:40
1. Current Environmental Stress 

00:33:40
2. Trauma Hx. 

00:33:40
3. Developmental hx 

00:33:40
4. Medical hx 

00:33:40
5. Family mental health hx 

00:33:40
6. Family discipline style and affection style 

00:33:40
7. (DSM-IV Axis 1 through 5) 

00:33:40
STEVE THAXTON And so, part of the skill set is working with children and reading through their play what it is that they are needing, they are working on, and we’ll get into that a little bit more detail or I know what the trauma history is, but I went for them to get me an opening because they are not ready to verbalize it. Right? So, sometimes -- okay, so here is the breakdown of the complex traumatized children. 

00:34:10
A. Children with multiple traumas, RAD 

00:34:10
issues, resistant children, or unknown 

00:34:10
trauma hx need stabilization with 

00:34:10
play therapy and EMDR. 

00:34:10
B. Single incident traumas with children 

00:34:10
from strong support systems can go 

00:34:10
straight to trauma targeting. 

00:34:10
C. Children in play will give clues to 

00:34:10
trauma hx. Specific targets will come 

00:34:10
forth…… 

00:34:10
STEVE THAXTON So, we have children with multiple traumas, reactive attachment issues, resistant kids, unknown trauma history. Single incident trauma children go from -- with strong support systems, you can -- they are dreamy, they are so great to have, they are like -- because they come in, I had a girl come in very similar story. I think she was eight. She had been on a school bus and seeing the bus driver hit another car and was killed and all the kids on the bus saw it. What manifested for her and her trauma was, her parents couldn’t take her anywhere because she would just have meltdowns and screaming fits to the point where she couldn’t handle it either and wasn’t sleeping. So, that was an example of really great parents, really solid girl, great grades, easy, we got in, we drew through it, I used the thera-tappers, we were done processing that trauma in like three or four sessions. Last one was just coming and review, and she was happy and the parents were pleased and so, those are the ones that are very reinforcing because it’s like wow, what a great tool? So, children in play will give clue to their trauma history and their traumas will come forth. 

00:35:30
I give children a demo and explanation of how EMDR 

00:35:30
works…through shoulder taps, thera-tappers, bilateral light 

00:35:30
saber movements and later through art when specific targets 

00:35:30
present themselves. 

00:35:30
Children gravitate towards the light sabers in the room, or I will 

00:35:30
suggest "let’s play Star Wars" 

00:35:30
Along with EMDR protocol of "go with that", I allow children to 

00:35:30
form their own worlds and act out their schemas. Through 

00:35:30
their schemas, they find their missing ego states. I install the 

00:35:30
qualities they need. 

00:35:30
I work at blending in to their story line… 

00:35:30
STEVE THAXTON Uhm I give kids a demo and explain how EMDR works through shoulder traps, thera-tappers, I make it part of a game, right, just like we did earlier. So, it becomes fun. You know how kids can be resistant if you know -- if they know that you want them to do that. Right? So, I kind of slip it in and I just, I plan in the thera-tappers, and I -- we do different things, so that they can have fun with it. That’s the key. That’s where we're sneaking it in. Along with EMDR protocol of "go with that" I allow children to form their own worlds and act out their schemas. Through their schemas, they find their missing ego states or parts and I install the qualities that they are capitalizing on. And I work just to blend in the story line rather than dictating or restructuring it too much. So, like I said, I trust that they're gonna go where they need to go and a huge component here is a safe place. 

00:36:30
Safe place: 

00:36:30
As in EMDR protocol, the next step is creating a 

00:36:30
literal safe place in the room. Here, light sabers 

00:36:30
are useless, laser guns cannot penetrate, and 

00:36:30
"wounded" characters automatically heal 

00:36:30
Children LOVE the safe place. 

00:36:30
EMDR instillations of the safe place have 

00:36:30
healing benefits from the first session. 

00:36:30
STEVE THAXTON One caveat is that if a child is not safe, we don’t do a safe place, because it’s contradictory to their reality, right? So, for example, if you are dealing with a child that is in the foster care system and they're still being shuffled around, or you are not sure of what's going on at home, we don’t do this. But when children have finally stabilized in their environments, we install a safe place with them and in the adult protocol with adults, it’s a mental image. With children I do it behaviorally so that there is an actual, it can be a couch, it can be a corner of your office, there is a safe place, where nobody can get in and as I’m playing with them they know that if they get in there, their characters stay safe, all their wounds heal and they are safe, okay. And then we do some bilateral stimulations in that safe place to ground that experience for them neurologically and Dr. Shapiro and I've seen it for myself too, discusses how there sort of a ripple effect that just by doing an installation with a safe place can sometimes reverberate through this little child and channel into -- spill over into a stronger sense of self, more happiness just on a safe place, because we're once again, installing neurologically apart that's often neglected for kids who are frequently unsafe. Does that make sense? Okay. So, we're almost to the fun part, don’t fall sleep on me yet. Okay. So here are some common themes in a Star Wars format. Once again, you can create your own avenues to play. So, obviously you know Darth Vader. 

00:38:25
DARTH VADER 

00:38:25
The Red light saber is Darth Vader. 

00:38:25
STEVE THAXTON He is a bad guy. And so, the kids know the levels of this fiction more than I ever will or care to. But if they grab the red light saber, they know that they are going to be Darth Vader. And he can destroy his opponents with mere hand gestures, he was good as a child but later became bad. I’m powerful, I’m in control. Right? So, there is a one character. 

00:38:55
LUKE 

00:38:55
Blue light saber is Luke Skywalker 

00:38:55
STEVE THAXTON Luke, he is the blue light saber, he is often the underdog in the play. He is Darth Vader’s son and maybe used to act out anger at parents. I’m good. I can overcome the impossible. 

00:39:10
YODA 

00:39:10
Green light saber is Yoda. 

00:39:10
STEVE THAXTON Yoda, short and homely, Yoda is wise Jedi master. He has special Jedi powers and jumps in when all is lost. I’m safe, I can get help, I’m resourceful. 

00:39:25
MACE WINDU 

00:39:25
Purple is Mace Windu…. a Jedi doomed to death. 

00:39:25
STEVE THAXTON Purple is Mace Windu and a Jedi doomed to death and so on and so forth. 

00:39:30
PRINCESS 

00:39:30
LAYA 

00:39:30
Princess Leia 

00:39:30
STEVE THAXTON Princess Leia, the princess has a powerful role as heroine and is an active role for girls. I’m powerful, I’m strong, I’m capable. 

00:39:35
Children usually stick to themes in play 

00:39:35
revolving around the ego state 

00:39:35
they are utilizing…… 

00:39:35
"Go with that" allows for children to find 

00:39:35
their own way in any given story line. 

00:39:35
Over time, egos come to a climax and 

00:39:35
resolution; cognitions are installed; children 

00:39:35
work towards mastery of their worlds. 

00:39:35
STEVE THAXTON  Children usually stick to the themes in play revolving around the ego state that they are utilizing. "Go with that" allows for children to find their own way in any given storyline. Over time, egos come to a climax and resolution; cognitions are installed; children work towards mastery of their own worlds. 

00:40:00
Previously avoided material will surface 

00:40:00
for trauma targeting as the play evolves. 

00:40:00
(for example: perpetrators, abandonment, 

00:40:00
memories, etc.) 

00:40:00
With these openings, I soften the EMDR by 

00:40:00
using art to process the trauma. 

00:40:00
STEVE THAXTON Previously avoided material will surface as the play evolves. For example, perpetrators, abandonment, specific memories. So, we are trying to lay the foundation for them to feel safe and comfortable with you and stronger in terms of their own little brains and psychology and then once we get that solidified either they will start giving you clues and becoming more verbal towards their traumas or you can address those pieces, like past is kind of reminds me of this. Alright? With the openings, I soften the EMDR by using art to process the trauma, this is it, okay. So, here is the slide. 

00:40:40
This format access left and right hemispheres 

00:40:40
STEVE THAXTON So, we've -- I have a child that has a incredible trauma history. We played, played, played, played, played. They are doing better. I get an opening to process some trauma and this is a representation of a trauma that happened to them. And so, as you can see on the bottom, there is light grid scale one to ten and ten is high and one is and there is so often is zero. So, as we do the tapping with them, these traumas are filed down and so it’s a nice way instead of having to say, okay Billy, tell me about when you are kidnapped. It allows them to put on paper what it is and address it that way. That makes sense. Okay, here we go. 

00:41:40
Case example: 

00:41:40
Tom 

00:41:40
STEVE THAXTON Let me, I would like to read for you a case study and then we're gonna have a practicum, alright? Are we doing it on time? Okay. Tom is an eight-year old, who was brought to counseling by his grandparents. He live with them because his mother was in jail on drug charges. Tom presents with several behavioral problems. He got into physical fights in class and on the playground. He did not mind his grandparents and disobeyed the rules at home. His grandfather was erroneously certain, he was bipolar and/or ADD and wanna therapy to fix him. In addition to being relocated to his grandparents for parenting, he was also present when his infant sibling died at home. So, here are those multiple traumas coming in. And he had another sibling become adopted out of his home not to be seen again. He met criteria for reactive attachment disorder and major depression. He presented disheveled in his clothing and grooming. He has spoken a baby voice, indicative of his infantile ego state. Initially his dialog and play were centered on tangential storylines that kept him in a fantasy state. He was lost in a fantasy of videogame storylines. He talked randomly about characters and beings that did not exist. He couldn’t be in here now really with me. He had a difficult time relating interpersonally and therapy. He discussed letting his girlfriend "be my master on the playground" he allowed his friends to control him. Tom did not initially engage in linear dialog. He was not able to focus on the topic for very long. He prefer to communicate through play and he love Star Wars. I initially use sessions to stabilize Tom, he would enter the room frequently and went straight to the toy bank, contained the light sabers. He decided that the corner of the office was a safe place as we discussed. Tom became a Jedi master engaged in a lightsaber malay in the session. He took on the voice and body language of a powerful being. He beat the therapists, that’s me, several times during the play and reveled in his victories. So, here you see these children kind of exploring these altered stated, altered egos. Let’s see the therapists, me, in a world cognitions with Tom such as you are powerful and wow you are so strong. Tom maintained his affect of Jedi master and proceeded to the corner of the room to command more rebel troops through an imaginary phone. After playing, fighting imaginary foes throughout the whole room with his light saber, he was victorious. The therapist tapped on the shoulders for a set of 10 taps and had him say, I’m strong one time. Tom thought shoulder taps were hilarious and laughed while receiving the taps. Over nine sessions, Tom continued to play Star Wars. His baby voice receded, he was able to talk about here and now and was not stuck in fantasy. Darth Vader made fewer appearances in the play. His grandfather reported that he was less anxious at home and at school. His peer relationships improved. He started laughing more in heat session. Star Wars play became less intense. He also completed EMDR art therapy to address anxiety nightmares. He targeted trauma regarding the death of his infant sibling. One-week after trauma targeting, he reported no residual trauma about the death of his sibling. His nightmare stopped. He continued ongoing talk and play therapy. His mother continued to struggle with drug addiction and illegal system causing Tom to need support. So, that’s that piece where there is so much going on, that we use EMDR where we can get it and then there is still other really important relationship components for these kids. Okay. EMDR quickens the integration of ego states that kids need to explore. Tom had been victimized and abandoned throughout his life. In therapy, he was able to explore and install parts of himself that have been neglected or under-developed such as a sense of safety, self-confidence and self-esteem. He stabilized through play therapy and was then able to address specific traumas. What I’d like to do now is take what we’ve learned and compact it even more. You're gonna really get in your bang for your buck now it's gonna be so compact. So, meet me over in our corner please and we're going to review this very quickly. Alright? So, what I did for you is I took everything that we discovered and compacted it. Okay. So, this is the practicum piece. We’ve built the building blocks to get hit at this point, okay. So, in a nutshell, do a complete evaluation and then two, play therapy and stabilization is good for children who are not ready to do more complicated trauma processing. For example, children who are ADD, ADHD perceived, attachment disorder children, non-verbal children, children who do not remember the trauma, right? Stabilize, stabilize, stabilize that’s the key, right, or getting them to the point where they can address those trauma specifically. Stabilize, stabilize, stabilize. Safe place. First create a safe place in the room, such as a corner, couch or rug when the child with therapist is in a safe place, no fighting can be done. The character is safe. When the characters are hurt during the play, the child can be cured, restored and reenter the play. Safe place is important in the beginning to stabilize the child, install the cognition, I’m safe. There are therapeutic spillover benefits from installing safe place. And then once again, I have that reminder, don’t do EMDR if the child's home environment is not yet stable. If a child cannot establish a safe place, slow the therapeutic piece. This is a sign that more report is needed, alright? Through playing, children find and explore ego states that they need and/or are lacking. When a child is in a positive ego state, get it install it. You can use bilateral stimulation with light sabers or tap on the shoulders or on the hands. You can state the cognition to the child or better yet have the child state the cognition himself or herself, I’m powerful. Allow the child to tell their story. They will inform you what needs to happen with their characters. They will tell you what role you will play as well. So, there they're going to be in charge up to a point like you’ve mentioned. If they start being inappropriate, hurting you or doing stupid things, it stops. But in terms of the themes, where they go, what characters involve, they get to take all the rings. After a while the child would become more stabilized, more grounded, they will provide clinical openings to specific traumas. My little brother died or the clinician can bring up the trauma if the child seems ready. Hey, let’s draw a picture about your brother. Right? Return to the play if the child is not ready to do trauma processing. Does that make sense? 

00:48:40
 Yeah. 

00:48:40
STEVE THAXTON Alright. So, we are going to switch hats with your partner, one time you're gonna be the child and then one time you're gonna be the therapist, so, we have just a few things that we're gonna add on to each other, so, we're gonna do each exercise twice, one as the child, one as a therapist, okay? Okay. So, the first one is very gently with your play buddy, just let’s see, will you be my partner for a second? Okay, so we're gonna go back and forth like this and just do that. So, it may seem simple, but you know what we're doing, we're doing a bilateral stimulation. See that. And not all the time, but sometimes I’ve seen children and just stay here and they are processing, right? Does that make sense? 

00:49:40
 Yes. 

00:49:40
STEVE THAXTON So, just gently go back and forth like that. Okay, perfect. So, I want you to do that and reflect to your partner, wow, whatever positive cognition you think they might be utilizing at that time, obviously we're pretending because we don’t or not really doing therapy, but it can be I’m -- man you're so powerful, you are so strong. Look at you, you are just amazing, right? Pause for one-second, pause one second. Great, great job. So, once again, see how we're going sneaky, we are having a lot of fun, we are doing clinical work and we don’t even know it or the child would even know it, okay. So, then the next tier of skill set is to play with your play partner, however you want to, it doesn’t have to be the simple thing. You could pretend to be Darth Vader, you can be Princess Leia, you can be Harry Potter, and you're gonna play, just play with each other and then at some point, just stop and jump in and we have talked to the children in advance. So the kids that we're working with know this already. Alright? Okay, grab on and tap these hands for me, tap these hands for me. Now can you say, I’m safe? 

00:51:05
 I’m safe. 

00:51:05
STEVE THAXTON Can you say it even louder? 

00:51:05
 I’m safe. 

00:51:05
STEVE THAXTON Say, I’m safe. 

00:51:05
 I’m safe. 

00:51:05
STEVE THAXTON You are so safe, excellent and that’s it. We got in an installation right there. That’s all it is, okay? 

00:51:15
 Okay. 

00:51:15
STEVE THAXTON Alright. So, go ahead and have fun for a little bit please. So, normally when we begin a session, we do the inverse. We do a safe place first. Just for skills training, we started with these little pieces to kinda get you in the mindset of utilizing these components, okay. So, the last component here is what you saw me do with rose bush and you can pretend to be in your office, you can pretend to be outside, you could be at a hospital, wherever you are working with children and so, what we're gonna do is, you're gonna be the child for a second, and I’m going to say, I’m sorry, what’s your name? 

00:51:55
 Mary. 

00:51:55
STEVE THAXTON Okay, Mary, here is the deal. Here is our couch, and here is how we're gonna play. This couch is our safe place. So, I’m Darth Vader and if you hurt me or use your magic spells on me and I get so sick that I’m about to pass out. Guess what, I’m gonna get on this couch and there is a force filled around this couch and you cannot get me, no matter how bad you try. And you know what else, I get all my energy back. 

00:52:25
 Sorry, what was that? 

00:52:30
STEVE THAXTON I get all my energy back. I become -- so if you hurt me and I’m down on the ground on death door, I’m back in the safe spot and I’m safe. Wounds heel, the force is with you or Harry Potter’s magic cloak is with you or whatever format it is, so it’s an incredibly powerful metaphor. So, use your adult brain really quickly and realize that even though it’s fun and we're having a great time, this is a very powerful clinical piece, okay. So, then the object is once you have the safe spot and like I said before, it can be only the red part of this rug and you can be very creative and you can -- once you pitch the idea of the child, you can let them decide what the safe place is going to be and somebody talked about boundaries earlier, sometimes they’ll push the boundaries on this because they want to get you, they want to get you and then I’m safe and then they love it because then they flip because then they jump in a safe place throughout the play and they got to be safe and then I pretend like I’m trying to get to them, but I’m just letting them absorb the fact they are in a safe spot. Okay. So, you've already done the previous skill sets, which apply to the safe spot. So, once they are on the couch or in the red spot or sitting on the chair or whatever might appeal to you then we do a safe spot. Can you say, I’m safe? 

00:53:55
 I’m safe. 

00:53:55
STEVE THAXTON Can you say, I’m super safe? 

00:53:55
 I’m super safe. 

00:54:00
STEVE THAXTON Excellent fantastic, alright, and then we disperse. And so what I try to do is hit a safe spot or a safe installation every time, no matter what we're doing. Does that make sense? So, it’s such an anchor piece that no matter what we end up doing from one week to the next, maybe it's Harry Potter this week, it's Star Wars next, where there is a safe place in there and I’m going to get it, because I’m gonna get them to feel safe in that spot. 

00:54:30
 (inaudible ) if you've got a child that is doing the play that is not going to the safe place, and you go to the safe, then you think it institutes you to tap (inaudible ). 

00:54:42
STEVE THAXTON That is a great question. Did everybody hear that? Okay, yes and you're modeling at that point and that is an excellent example as well as of what’s going on clinically, your clinical impressions, why would a child not want to go to a safe spot, even though they feel safe with you, there is a lot in there in that very statement, right? But I do take the lead and jump into the safe spot and act safe and model to them what -- that I’m safe and that mean as Darth Vader, oops does get to recharge and heel and then if they don’t want to go there, I don’t say you’ve got to get in that safe spot, I just let the play continue and I take advantage of the safe spot as a metaphor and as modeling, okay. 

00:55:30
 Can I ask you a question? 

00:55:30
STEVE THAXTON Sure. 

00:55:30
 Can I ask you a question what would happen(inaudible ) through the safe spot, I was continually making sure you couldn't get there, would that happen? 

00:55:40
STEVE THAXTON Sure, I have died several times. Yeah, I’ve been wounded and fallen to the ground and talk about a child feeling powerful as a character. I don’t get -- I don't let it get to be morrows, and I'll come out of character and go, would you just stop it, that’s too much, if they get too modeling. But if it’s where they need to be and they need to take control over those metaphors and I allow it to happen and then we explore that and that once again adds more clinical impressions for me on my hunches as to why they're doing, what they're doing. 

00:56:20
 Is there a significance of you tapping or they tapping? 

00:56:30
STEVE THAXTON I don’t have a research on that. Usually I try to get them to tap whatever way I can get them to tap. So, the easiest way is for me to tap their hands, I like it better if they tap me, because then they're more involved and I feel like if I offer them a cognition, it’s good, but, if they can originate the cognition from themselves out to you, it’s even better. So, that’s just my own little notes. So, I don’t know this right. So, but that’s my hunch is that the more they are able to actively engage in the process, the better the intervention. 

00:57:05
 I made a huge stop to do the technique, on one occasion (inaudible ) another occasion where the child is happy. 

00:57:20
STEVE THAXTON Usually, I think where that comes from is I’ll say, hey let’s tap on that. That’s they cue and then they will run in and tap me and then if I feel like they're not going where I would like them to I'm more engaged and I tap on them. Okay, so we are clipping down on time. Let’s take the excellent questions by the way. Let’s take the last ten minutes and once again have fun. Please don’t hurt each other and be creative and utilize or think about the clients that you work with in your office or your hospital or wherever it might really pertain to you in the real world and then I’ll just kind of walk around and pull me aside or ask me questions if you need to and then at about five till, we will do a really brief summary and like I said, we are going to spill out into the hall way if you have any questions, okay. Alright, have fun.

STEVE THAXTON Why don’t hold that thought, utilize this time to play with each other and then we'll -- I’ll break that down with you in the hall, okay. Does that sound good? Okay, thanks.

00:59:45
STEVE THAXTON Yes, and we stop and I negotiate -- we talk we’ll break it down right in there. And I give him another chance and if they can’t follow the rules, then I say look you need to make a choice, if you are not respecting my safe place then we have -- we can’t play this anymore and I let them choose. And if they can’t, then we shut it down and move on to some other activity, right, but they have to own it that it's because they are not respecting the boundaries that you are shutting down the play and we move onto the next piece. I don't a big production, but I --

STEVE THAXTON Yes, I’m sure. It’s an incredibly great teaching moment, even though it’s very frustrating, it’s incredibly powerful because those kids need boundaries, often times, they come from backgrounds that the adults don’t have boundaries, so it's a prime -- it shuts down what we're trying to do, but as a therapist it’s a great teaching moment for them to know, we can have -- 

01:01:00
 I can see a couple of kids (inaudible ). 

01:01:05
STEVE THAXTON Yes, right, exactly.

STEVE THAXTON Alright folks, really quickly, ensure it, I hope you leave with a broad understanding and ability conceptualize on EMDR and play therapy and how they intertwine. I just had another reminder and a great question. How do I get EMDR trained? So, I just before last week when I got here I googled, EMDR Australia, so if you just google EMDR Australia, you’ll get the official website, there is clinicians, I’m sure all over the country and it’s really great because I’ve learned from some really amazing clinicians that have taught me stuff in my town. So it’s great to meet and study groups and also get the nuts and bolts training, it's very important because they will of course explore all the menus that we didn’t have time in 90 minutes today. Okay, thanks and please meet me, well let’s if you could help me, pull these chairs back and then I will take the suitcase towards the door and we will distribute the light sabers and then I will meet you in the hallway and we can talk about your clients, okay. Thank you.
