Janis Abrahms Spring, Ph.D. 

00:01:00
ELLEN It's a great please to introduce to you this morning Dr. Janis Abrahms Spring. Janis is one of our tried and true speakers. She has presented at the Couple's Conference many many times and is especially well known for her work in the area of infidelity. We all know, it's a lot easier to get into infidelity than it is to get successfully out of it. And perhaps that's why Mary Chevalier said, we pick our partners in dimmer light than we would ever pick our wardrobes. So, Janis' first book, After the Affair, healing the pain and rebuilding trust when a partner has been unfaithful has sold over 500,000 copies, really amazing. And there is probably not a person in the room who hasn't at least one time in your life had the fantasy of writing a best selling book, but very few of us have had the ability to think of the idea at a timely time to write it, do all that hard work of writing it and then do the extra hard work of getting the book known. And luckily for us, Janis had the ability to do that and as a result, we all have an incredible resource that we can use with our clients in her book After the Affair. Then never to rest on her laurels, Janis went on and wrote her book, which she will be talking about some this morning, her book Life with Pop and this contains many of the lessons she learned from caring for her aging father. And her most recent book, How Can I Forgive You, The Courage to Forgive, The Freedom Not to addresses the complexity of forgiveness and looks at what happens when the person who "did wrong" is involved in the process of making it right, but also what happens when they're not willing or unavailable or refused to be involved in that process. Janis' talks always draw from her many years of clinical experience, but also she is deeply personal and brings enormous credibility to what she says. And over the years of doing this conference, I've been fortunate to develop meaningful friendships with some of our speakers and Janis is definitely one of those special to you. So, I hope you will join me in welcoming a gifted clinician and incisive author and a valued friend and supporter of this conference.

JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Thank you Ellen. Such generous words. So, she brings tears to my eyes. So, I will tell I often cry the whole time when I am giving talks. You'll have to just get used to me, probably cry through this one too. And also thanks Jeff so much for bringing me back. Okay, I am going to get right into it, because there is so much to talk about today. In 2000, when my mother died of lung cancer, compliments Camel cigarettes, my 80-year-old father one of the sweetest and most helpless man has ever known turned to me tearfully and pleaded may I come live with you. Here was my father, Dear Pop, the one who never asked for much, the one who love me as sweetly as any child could wish, begging me to save him from his loneliness, his despair, his terror and I was the one with the loving partner and the lovely home and I was too scared, smart, selfish to open my door. My mother was a strong beloved women who dedicated her life to dad, nourishing through him through a catalog of ailments from cancer to Pemphigus, Parkinson's. I think of myself as a caregiver too by nature and by profession, but I knew that if my father came to live with me, my life as I knew it, would be over. I would lose myself in him out of guilt. And in over developed sense of responsibility, I would become God forbid my mother. The next day as I planned my mother's funeral, my father began to fall apart. I won't cause you any trouble he said. I will take your clothes to the cleaners and make dinner. I will give you money to build a room for me. I swear this is what he said, my father. The man who didn't know how to use a microwave or an iron now begging me to be my personal valet. After much internal debate and discussion with my husband, I told him I am sorry dad, I can't do it. As much as I love you, as much as I owe you, it won't work. He never brought it up again. What I did do is move him north from Delray Beach, Florida to West Hartford, Connecticut, 75 minutes from my home. I set him up in a brand new independent living facility called Summer Wood, right down the street where he and my mother raised me. He still knew the lay of the land he could drive, had a few friends and in doing so, I began this journey, which I fondly refer to as Pop, The Project. Would it work? Could I balance my needs against his? Could I be a loving involved daughter and still maintain some semblance of my life? What exactly was I signing up for? I was as unsure as he. And so for the next five years from 2000 until his death in 2005, I managed his care and chronicled this journey. I wrote Life with Pop where most of the time, I speak in the voice of the devoted daughter, shepherding her father through his final years in a Jewish independent living facility. But from time to time, I step into my role as psychologist and counsel patients with caregiving stories of their own. Often my patients' stories are my stories, their struggles my struggles, there were times when they tell me their troubles and I cry, what I don't tell them, what they don't know is that I am crying for both of us. When Ellen first and Jeff asked me to give this talk, she said be sure to apply to couples. It's interesting, the pressure is of caring for an aging parent, of course it falls on the backs of the partner. But it's interesting since this journey began that more and more of my friends are caring for aging, ailing partners, absolute same dynamic. And by the way, who is next? We are next. The healthier spouse coming down the pike. 90 million Americans care for someone over 75 typically a parent, grand parent or partner with 45 million baby boomers in the wings. Challenge number one, normalizing you response and surviving the job. My Rabbi, Rabbi Stein once gave a sermon on the noble and challenging work of caregivers. It's hard, he said. Almost unimaginably hard to be a caregiver. For when care for someone whose mind and body have been greatly diminished by illness, your life is consumed by it and there is little relief and respect. You must struggle against exhaustion he said, against self pity, against resentment and a host of other emotions that no one who has not gone through what you are going through can never begin to understand. My Rabbi ran his eyes over his congregants and went on. You know who you are, you wear no badges, receive no plaques, there are no tribute dinners in your honor. We give medals to soldiers who show courage and adversity, but not to those ordinary people who sacrifice their lives caring for the sick and old. I can only imagine how much you must wish that at least once in your life, someone would recognize what you are going through, someone would speak to your Hagrid souls so you would not feel so terribly alone. My parents had a wonderful expression. He said, they used to say no one should ever find out how much he's capable of enduring. Caregiving takes physical and emotional stamina day after day sometimes year-after-year. Caregivers are asked to hold on fiercely caring for someone they may not always have love for, but sometimes complex and ambivalent feelings. It could be said that this is heroism of the highest order. If you would have cared for an aging parent or partner, you know the routine, the late night calls, the early morning falls, the albatross that won't release its grip. I came to envy the freed of my friends whose parents had passed away, it's not that I wanted my father died, I just wanted to be free of my obligation to him. I wanted my life back, this pummeling, this constant state of high alert. So, not simply burdensome, but punishing and he didn't even live with me and he wasn't even demanding. In the unbearable lightness of being, the author Condura says, "There is nothing heavier than compassion." There is a psychological term for the burn out caregiver's feel, it's called compassion fatigue with no relief inside, with too much responsibility and too little control, caregivers absorb the patients trauma and become what Pulitzer Prize winning author Robert Butler calls the Second Patient. They develop headaches. They can't sleep. They generally feel irritable, preoccupied, depressed. They stop taking care of themselves, substituting drugs and food for what they need most, excercise, nurturing relationships, good times, a nap. They start to have accidents. I know, I had three in the four years that I was caring for my dad in my car while I was organizing his life, scheduling aids and doctors appointment when I should have been watching the road. I thought I should go see a psychologist, but who has the time. It can get to you. After a few years of caring for my dad, I was exhausted. Lifting him in and out of a wheelchair, helping him to doctors. I loved my father and frankly he was easy to love. I remember thinking if dad dies in the next five years, I don't know how I will stand it. If dad lives another five years, I don't know how I'll stand it. It's natural for caregivers to want to reclaim their lives, to escape from prison. It can be a hellish job. Emotions easily arise to the surface, emotions that don't make you look so good. And I hope in this talk to normalize those feelings and experiences that you have and will have so that you don't feel so crazy and alone. The second challenge, choosing the right living facility. Often the caregivers placed in this very awkward position of where to put the aging parent or the sickly partner. How do you forgive yourself for putting them in a facility when they beg to live with you even if it's a good facility, even if the other members and your family back you up. Let's look at how we can earn our own forgiveness. When we forgive ourselves, we accept our complicity for all the ways the we wrong this person and we work to redress the harm we've caused. But it's also important to judge ourselves with the same gentle and patient understanding, we would offer a good friend. It may ask, help to ask, how would I talk to a friend who after much self questioning decided to put her parent or partner in a home? Would I berate her for setting the midst. The caregiving child needs to talk back to the harsh with criminating voice that's say she is selfish and bad, bad for feeling so burned out, bad for craving her own space, bad for tending to her own needs and believing that the quality of her life matters too. I berated myself for closing my doors to my dad. Other people berate themselves for opening their doors. A patient name Eureal told me that when her mother got sick, she brought her mother in. She said the truth as I didn't want my mother to leave with me, but I couldn't say no. How do people do it? How do put their patents in a facility without a shred of guilt? I envy them. I am jealous, she said. I think some children put their parents in a facility because they genuinely believe the facility is a better place for them. They may sight such things as safety. The house is a death trap, too many steps, slippery floors and no walking shower. But other children put their parents in a facility not because it's a better place for the parents, but it's better for them. They do this guilt free, maybe their office is at home. When they need that space. Maybe they have a cat and the mother is allergic to the cat and frankly the cat stays and the mother goes and frankly some people constitutionally are just more selfish than others. When they say me they feel fine. Others are born givers when they say me, they are feel uncomfortable and dirty. Life experiences also shape us. If your grandmother lived with you for example during your childhood and you remember a positive loving experience with her, you may want to invite your mother into your home and give your kids the same rich inter-generational experience you had, but let's say your grandmother live with you and everyone suffered, your mother who ran herself ragged, your father who felt abandoned and when often had an affair and you who felt starved for tension, you may grow up resentful and love to subject your family to the same intrusion. Most of us try to make a thoughtful choice, balancing the care for our parents against care for ourselves, the bad only seem to take place between their needs and ours, but often the battle's actually waged inside of us. The process of deciding where to place our parents forces us to grapple with our deepest values and discover who we are, it's a wrenching experience. Because we not only confront our mother, our father, our partner, we confront ourselves.

00:18:20
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Okay, challenge three. Choosing to be involved. It's hard enough sacrificing for an appreciative parent, but how hard is it when that person is ungrateful. It helps to take the ingratitude less personally. If your elderly mother for example is contentious, you might ask has she been this way her whole life, maybe she was born with the chemical imbalance, maybe she was jealous of you for all the attention her husband gave you and not her, maybe she got this from a parent who gave her too much and never taught her. She had an obligation to give back. There are so many explanations more than we know. Maybe its sickness and old age, maybe she is in pain, maybe she is lost her mind, doesn't realize how sharp she is, but you have something else to consider. However difficult it is for us to care for ungrateful parents, it's harder for them to admit their dependence on us. The more they need us the more they may resent us. There is an old Irish proverb, When parents feed their children, they both laugh. When children feed their parents, they both cry. In the end, a parent may not deserve our love. We care for them not because of who they are, but because of who we are. Because we couldn't live with ourselves otherwise. And so we indulge them never giving up the hope that someday they'll turn to us and say thank you. You are a good son, you are a good daughter, you are good wife or husband, I appreciate all you do for me. At some point though, your loved ones may not be able to communicate anything, but your caregiving to us don't stop. When if due to Alzheimer's, they don't even recognize you? Never mind all you do for them, nothing can prepare for you this moment when this person who gave you life, now looks at you like a stranger, or worse and enemy. I remember when my dad fell into delirium triggered by a urinary tract infection. I rushed him to the hospital. He was frustrated and confused and didn't understand where he was and why he had to stay in bed catheterized. He lashed out at me when I refused to help him to the bathroom. Why don't you do the simplest thing I ask, he implored me. His eyes were poison darts, filled with hate and I tried hard not to take it personally and to be a big person. But I felt cut and betrayed and angry at myself for letting him get to me but he was so sick. So, here is the first move clip from this amazing movie with Julie Christie called Away from Her. She plays a role of an aging women who, when she puts a frying pan into the freezer realizes that she is losing her mind. She packs a bag and tells her husband of 44 years, it's time to move into a nursing home. He's devastated and vows to visit her regularly, but the facility has a thirty day no-visitor policy to help residents adjust to the new home. And in this clip, he returns a month later. It's on Christmas Day, you will see the Christmas tree in the background. His wife at that point barely recognizes him and to make matters worse, she has developed a new love with another man. At first the husband tries to fight this, but his wife only responds with confusion. Gradually he accepts the reality of her Alzheimer's disease, the unclenching of her mind and he let's go. Away from Her. It's been said that to love someone means caring as much for their happiness as your own. It's not easy. Caregiving can require selflessness that can make you feel eviscerated. So, it's important as a caregiver to remain clear on why we are doing, what we are doing. To help myself, I wrote a Piece and Life with Pop on why I visited my father. Here it is. Why do I visit dad? What motivates me? Love, of course. Love manifests itself not just in how we feel towards someone, but in how we treat them. Is it guilt? I feel crummy about myself ignoring the person who nurtured me for 55 years. How great is my dad? Is it compassion? Dad is nearing the end of his life and can't manage by himself must be hard to be so dependant, fragile and alone. Is it a relief of my anxiety. Taking control of his life, I feel more in control of my own when I am in charge. I worry less about how he is doing, because I know he is getting the attention he needs. What about pleasure? No question all the tender moments we've shared has sweetened my life. Here is a reason I visit dad that I was unaware of when I started this journey, but I am sure of today, it makes me feel like a decent human being, said aim above reality, be not simply good, be good for something. When I made goods left-off my father’s life happier or more comfortable, I feel grounded and good about myself. One more reason, I'll remind you that these old people are me. If I am so lucky to live as long and well as they do, their journey for shadow is mine. I am next coming down the pike, faster than the seasons turn from green to white. I also visit so my kids will visit me someday. I set a model I hope they'll follow when I am struck to a wheel chair in the lobby of a nursing home, dying for tender touch. Let's look at the next challenge, fighting ageism, those attitudes and behaviors that devalue the elderly. I once watched Is a Resonant at Summer Wood poking through the prunes in the breakfast buffet, what are you doing is the I asked looking for one that’s plump and juicy he is equipped. Isn't that what we all want, plump and juicy? Life at its fullest not something, someone without and dried up? What comes to mind when you think of the word old, look at up in the thesaurus and you’ll find your sets of synonyms. One is unapologetically negative or kayak, bygone, grumbling, dated, decayed, moth eaten, obsolete, out-moted, per se, unfashionable worn-out. The second set offers a more positive view; constant, enduring, established, practiced, time honored, skilled. How do we learn to accentuate the positive to go from washed-up to venerable, from cast-off to vintage, from outdated to experienced and wise. Frankly I am not optimistic we can, we live in a fast pace, youth obsessed twittering society and so long as we value achievement over connection, outer beauty over beauty, competence over kindness, the elderly will be marked and marginalized even by themselves. There is a wonderful story about an 80-year-old man who is sitting in the doctor’s office, waiting to be seen, the doctor is running late. The old man walks over to the front desk and says to the reception I have to go, every day I have lunch with my wife at 12:30, she is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. So, does she know you the nurse asked. No. So, she must not know what time of day you come? True. So, why is it an important picture there? Because the man explained even though she doesn’t know who I am, I haven’t forgotten who she is. We learn so much from the old, it’s easy to focus on their infirmities and limitations, but what about their humanity, their courage, dignity and wisdom? What about ours? All right, sorry for the crying. Okay, let’s look at challenge five, addressing unfinished business and setting the stage for forgiveness. Research shows that as people age, they tend to forgive more easily, how do they do it? Is it that nearing the end of their lives, they opt to pack lighter, refusing to take their bitterness or sorrow with them to the grave. Have they swallowed enough disappointment over the years to learn not to choke on it, maybe time has dealt the pain or taught them to expect less from others. However, they are accomplishing it, they decide to move the beyond their grievances and try to enjoy what’s left of the journey. We can take a lesson from the elderly on this one. As people reach the end of their lives, when time is running out, adult children and elderly parents or partners may have one last chance to clear up hurtful understandings and apply savvy to each other’s wounds, there they forge and interaction that sets the stage for genuine forgiveness. Few years ago, I was interviewed on the radio on the topic of forgiveness. A middle-aged woman called in for her advice. Her father was dying in hospice. She said that there was a hurt that stuck in her gut and that was that, in his entirely I feel never once said to her I love you. Should she confront him and attempt some sort of restitution and reconciliation. The truth that she said, she had been loveable herself to him over the years. We discussed the risks she might end her father's life on a sour note. She might find out there indeed he never loved her, but time was running out, it was unlikely she'd have another chance. If she could bind her wound, it might be worth the risk. She asked me how to proceed. I suggested that she began by apologizing to her father for which she felt sorry for, for all the way she had wronged him. In the end, if she didn't earn her father's forgiveness, she would earn her own self respect, she knew what she had done wrong, she had a chance to make it right and whatever she decided would color the rest of her life. Once she addressed how she had hurt her father, she might say to him that something else sat between the two of them, something he did that hurt her. I suggested she say I am not bringing this up to upset you, but to clear the air and perhaps to get closer, would you be interested in hearing more? If he said yes, she should remember not to bludge him with her truth. Remember, the way we send a message affects the way it comes back. You can't assault him and expect him to come forward on humble knee. I recommend you say something soft like what hurts me as I don’t remember you were ever telling me, you love me. I don’t want you to make something up, but if there is love in your heart, it would mean the world to me to hear that. When we tell the person what’s bothering us, a partner, a parent, or child. We give them a chance to readdress the injury in ways that matter us, peoples tend to setup these invisible hoops, I have this hoop and until you jump through the hoop, I'm not going to forgive you, but I talk about locating your pain, telling that person how you’re hurting and what exactly you need to heal, and in doing this, you give them a chance to make good. This interpersonal exchange paves the ways to forgiveness and frankly I believe the reparative work done between the two people held together by the violation, the elderly parent and the child, the parent and the child, the partner or at the other partner, I believe this is what deeply cleansing and transformative than anything that can be accomplished alone or with the therapist.

00:32:35
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Let's look at the next challenge, settling eruptions between siblings over healthcare and end of life decisions. How awesome is this responsibility deciding how much money should be spent on the ageing person or whether they should live or die? How much more impossible when siblings wrangle over healthcare and end of life decisions? My patient Ian wanted to put her mother in a facility in Connecticut, but her sister Beth wanted to move her to Main closer to her and accused her sister of just wanting to save money, the facility in Main was half the price of the one in Connecticut. Beth said I get a vote, Ian says yes you do, but I get two, one for me and one for dad and frankly he wouldn’t want mom in that rat hole that you are thinking of putting her in. So, in making these decisions, siblings who never saw eye-to-eye may come together to support each other, but just as likely they come to blow us, each insisting they alone knows what’s best, each is acting in the name of love as their anxiety mounts they may rip other part with vicious, self surrogate serving arguments. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:34:00
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Sometimes siblings think they are fighting about something that happened today, should be could mum in this facility or that? Should we give her this treatment or that? But really they're tearing at old wounds and mean to need to go back in time and resolve the conflict. Someone like Ian might say to her sister, I am wondering if there is something I’ve done over the years that has poised the space between us that makes it hard for us to agree on mom's care today. If the sister is a conflict avoider, she'd saying no, but Ian might press her and say, if we don’t hear our grievances, they’re going to sit between us. I am asking you to be honest with me. Please tell me, if there is something I’ve done that’s bothering you and then you’ve to be prepared to listen. Siblings shouldn’t be surprised if old resentments long suppressed erupt to the surface. Mom always treat your kids better than mine. You were always her favorite, why were you given the beach house? Why were you given mom’s ring? Why were you given dad’s business? Why did they support your education and not mine? You always have to be right. You’re always too busy, too selfish to help out. Why should you get a vote now? Sometimes family secrets make it impossible to resolve conflicts and it may be necessary to unlock them. Beth had secretly going through her mother’s check book, and discovered that the mother had given the other sister $10,000 to her and not to her. That was part of why she was particularly irked that now the sister was being so cheesy about the facility, but she couldn’t bring it up because she wasn't supposed to be checking out the check book. I say to caregivers it’s hard enough making end of life decisions by yourself, never mind with your siblings. So, be prepared, this is the time of high drama. There is so many feelings to confront and so many to deny. So many words not said, too many words, the wrong words, spoken with a venomous tongue; so much personal meaning assigned to each others' position, but if the siblings try to hear each out and try to address the unacknowledged subtext of each other’s fight, they may satisfy their parents best to see their children at peace, before they die. A seemingly easy solution is for parents to spell out their healthcare and end-of-care directives in signed legal documents, but that’s beyond us. These formal documents may provide some clarity and protection, but they're not going to prevent the horrible clashes that arise between siblings when deep rooted, unresolved emotional and personal issues muddy the water. So, now I’d like to show you the second movie clip from the movie The Savages. How many of you’ve seen this movie? okay. Starring the fabulous Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Laura Linney. So, these two in the movie are acting as brother and sister, they're forced into caring for their elderly irascible father when he is found painting his feces on the bathroom wall. They’ve been estrange from him since their youth. He was a physically violent and abusive father whom they hated. The two now inherent him, they go and search to find an affordable housing. The son finds a basic nursing home, that accepts Medicare. He is satisfied now and he is treating his dad better than the dad ever treated him, but the daughter struck down by guilt and grief and she is looking for something "nicer". She manages to get her father an interview in this classy well appointed facility, but they only accept higher functioning patients. It’s an unbelievably powerful movie as the siblings care for their ageing dad, he actually softens under their protection, and they come to terms with their abuse, the nightmare of their childhood and they make peace with each other and with themselves. All right, let’s go on and talk about money. Here is what gets sticky if the cost of it all. Many caregivers struggle with guilt and anxiety, resentment. How much of my retirement fund am I willing to sacrifice to keep an elderly parent or partner alive, and who is going to support me when my savings are gone? Tell me how do you trust when you’re acting in your parents' best interest, when they never told you what to do and you’ll profit financially if they die. Profiting from a parent’s death? How low can a child go, yet who hasn’t dreamt of inheriting something who hasn’t wondered how much. This money thing, I know with my capacity just think clearly from my dad. I called his dietician and I said I feel checkmated, because he needs the feeding tube and without it, he is going to die. And if he dies I am will get profit financially, and so because that seems so peculiar, that I am worried on keeping him alive even if it means denying him a humane exit, but she had wanted no part of this and she said, these decisions are always difficult dear. I was paralyzed, I didn’t know if letting my father die was merciful or reprehensible, loving or greedy. All I knew was pulling the plug on him, felt like murder with a cash prize. Another challenge, creating and appreciating every day moments of grace. When I was caring for dad, I would get annoyed at how slowly he would eat, it would take him an hour to finish tuna fish sandwich. I didn’t know how much I would miss that hour today, sitting in the park, watching the roses and ducks. Its challenge as caregivers to see beyond the list to be in the moment with the person who needs care. We need to awaken our senses, and inhale life and exhale the tumult we create. There can be plenty of redemptive moments, moments of grace, but we need to create, notice and appreciate them. Here’s one from the Life with Pop. It’s called a great baguette. It takes place where I take dad to go and visit a friend of his in the nursing home, Arthur, his old golf buddy. We find Arthur strapped to wheelchair and sitting in front of blurring television. My dad gets terribly upset uttering, terrible, terrible under his breath. So, I quickly wheeled his wheelchair out, load him into the car and we head to West Hartford Center. I said come on dad lets go have a hearty brunch. He was all in favor of that. We’d sit outdoors, we’d watch the young trendy shoppers walk by and inhale life. He had is agenda be it a great baguette, I had mine to talk to him about his wishes about the living or dying, he’d never told me. Dad I say, do you ever think about dying? About three seconds passed before he answers flatly, no. I tried to keep the subject on the table, just in case he wants to say more. I think I bought it all the time. Another few seconds passed, then with a wicked twinkle in his eye, he announces isn’t it is a great baguette. The truth is was this it is a great baguette and what makes it even greater is its smeared with real vegetable cream cheese, not the low fat doctor prescribed kind, but the big buttery loaded with cholesterol kind and coffee is smacking hot and delicious, and we're sitting outdoors, not in a home for the elderly and dad can still pick up that monster and stuff it into his face with his own two hands. So, why why, talk about dying now? I take the cue sit back and let the sun warm the space between us. All right challenge nine, making healthcare and end-of-life decisions. You are going to have make some critical decisions that’s suspected brain tumor and MRI, what if you found one? Are you going to subject that person to surgery at their age? When do you start treatment? When is enough, enough? When do you know when you’re prolonging life and prolonging death? For my father I tried to weigh the good against the bad, pleasure against pain, but how much pleasure does it take to one to live? How much suffering to want him die, back and forth caregivers go, like a metronome, live, die, live, die, when the time came for me to make a decision for my dad, I found solice in the words of Mary Oliver's palm, in Black Water Woods. Perhaps you’ll too. She says, to live in this world you must be able to do three things. To love what is mortal, to hold it deep against your bones, knowing your own life depends on it, and when the time comes to let it go, to let it go. Okay the last challenge. So, what I’ve learned from all of this, what can we learn, that’s going to prepare us of course, if we’re lucky enough to be a good old person. I made a list of reminders, caring from my dad. I hope that are going to help me survive old age and be kind of mortal octogenarian in my friends and family who want to come and visit. I filed the list away in the drawer, if am lucky I live long enough to need it and remember what I put it. So, here are few of the reminders. One, be sure to show appreciation when you’re kids or partner extend themselves to you. They have so much competing for their time. Those Eskimo pies, don’t just magically appear in your freezer. Show the person who takes care of you often. How grateful you are to their attention. Two, don’t be ashamed to use a cane or a walker. It’s stumped to let vanity trip you up, its selfish too, because your children will need to manage your recovery. Three, tell your friends and family how much you love them, how proud you’re of them. You may not be able to find the words tomorrow. Four, don’t be cranky and demanding, you will lose your audience. Five, try to accept your decline with humor. At 92, Robert Maxwell amused, as I look over my life, he said I have many regrets, fortunately I don’t remember what they are. And ask your kids to tell you the truth about your health you may want to opt for comfort and maintenance, not cure. If possible, tell them when you’re ready to go. So, I want to end by saying that my wish for you is the same as it is from me, as you’re accompanying an aging parent or a partner on this ordinary, extraordinary journey, may you have courage, and strength and many sweet and blessed memories. Thank you.
